The Motion is granted to the extent it seeks an extension of the deadline to depose Richard McCloskey to February 1, 2022. While the Motion represents that the City/Parish Defendants have been unable to locate Nick Collins, the Motion does not specifically seek an extension of the January 31, 2022 deadline to depose Nick Collins. Instead, via the proposed Order the City/Parish asks to only be required to timely notify Plaintiffs' counsel when they have located and communicated with Collins. The City/Parish Defendants are ORDERED to advise Plaintiffs' counsel as to efforts to locate and communicate with Collins by no later than February 21, 2022. If Mr. Collins cannot be located by that time, the parties shall confer to determine next steps. Signed by Magistrate Judge Erin Wilder-Doomes on 1/28/2022. (This is a TEXT ENTRY ONLY.

    "summary": "<p>On July 9, 2017, thirteen protesters and two reporters who were arrested during a protest in Baton Rouge filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the City of Baton Rouge, as well as numerous agents of the Baton Rouge Police Department, East Baton Rouge Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and other state agencies, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Article 306 of the State of Louisiana Children's Code. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well and monetary relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>After a Baton Rouge police officer shot and killed Alton Sterling, people gathered in Baton Rouge to speak out against the pattern of police misconduct in the area and, more generally, in the United States. In July 2016, a peaceful, youth-led protest gathered at the State Capitol building where participants spoke, sang, and prayed. Participants then marched around the area in the same fashion.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, law enforcement officers gathered. The officers ordered the protesters to disperse &ndash; an impossible order to comply with, since the police blocked off most of the surrounding streets, had already ordered the protesters to stay off the sidewalks, and were arresting people who stepped into the streets to leave.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the officers swept through the crowd, violently grabbing people and binding their wrists with plastic zip ties. The officers arrested a mix of protesters, reporters, and legal observers. One of the plaintiffs was a 17-year-old girl put in an adult prison with male inmates in violation of the Children&rsquo;s Code. Another plaintiff was separated from her children, including a five-year-old who was taken from her and put into child protective services.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had, in ordering the dispersal of a peaceful protest and unlawfully arresting participants, violated participants&rsquo; First Amendment rights to speech, assembly, and free press. The plaintiffs also claimed excessive force, unreasonable search and seizure, and civil conspiracy. The original complaint and some of the exhibits contained many photographic images depicting the actions of both protesters and law enforcement officers.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in the form of a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to end the practices and policies described above. The plaintiffs also sought a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the defendants to expunge the plaintiffs&rsquo; arrests at the defendants&rsquo; cost and bar the defendants from reporting the plaintiffs&rsquo; arrests to any law enforcement agency, database, employer, or credit agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a notice of related cases. The plaintiffs listed six cases that all involved damages lawsuits on behalf of people who were wrongfully arrested during the July 2016 Alton Sterling protests in Baton Rouge, including &nbsp;McKesson v. City of Baton Rouge.</p>\r\n<p>The case was originally assigned to Judge Shelly D. Dick. On July 12, 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge James J. Brady. Then, in light of the plaintiff&rsquo;s notice of related cases, the court reassigned the case to Judge John W. deGravelles and Magistrate Judge Erin Wilder-Doomes, the judges who presided over the McKesson case mentioned above.</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2017, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, adding an exhibit to the complaint listing the names and charges of all persons arrested during the protest.</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint and first amended complaint. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs&rsquo; failed to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) in their use of illustrative pictures in a petition and a &ldquo;Photographic Timeline&rdquo; as one of the exhibits. The defendants considered these to be unconventional and unprofessional.</p>\r\n<p>Then, on September 28, 2017, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a motion to strike the first amended complaint. The defendants made similar arguments to the motion above.</p>\r\n<p>On October 12, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal of some of the defendants, namely, the defendants associated with the Louisiana Sheriff&rsquo;s Association. Judge deGravelles approved this the next day.</p>\r\n<p>On January 2, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, removing some of the unconventional exhibits complained about in prior motions to dismiss. The amended complaint retained, however, much of the photographic imagery in the complaint itself. On January 11, 2018, the defendants, in response to the plaintiffs&rsquo; filing a second amended complaint, withdrew their September 11, 2017 and September 28, 2017 motions to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the following weeks, the defendants filed two motions to strike and four motions to dismiss the second amended complaint. In support of the motions to strike, the defendants argued again that the second amended complaint violated FRCP Rule 8. Additionally, the defendants claimed that the complaint contained redundant, immaterial, impertinent, and scandalous allegations.</p>\r\n<p>In support of the motions to dismiss, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Moreover, the defendants claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction over some of the defendants because Eleventh Amendment immunity applies to them. Lastly, the defendants argued that this case was ripe for dismissal on the grounds that the outcome of the case might influence the claims that had already been or had yet been filed.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2018, the defendants moved to stay discovery. Then, on February 26, 2018, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a motion to strike the second amended complaint. The defendants argued that the complaint should be dismissed and/or stricken because the 82-page, 333-paragraph complaint with its attached 64 pages of exhibits, violated the provision of FRCP Rule 8 that requires that a properly pled complaint contain &ldquo;a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.&rdquo; On May 14, 2018, Judge deGravelles granted in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay discovery. With the exception of written discovery, discovery was stayed pending resolution of the issues raised in the motions to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On January 22, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint against the Louisiana State Police and its superintendent, which the plaintiffs opposed on February 5, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the court granted and denied in part the motion. The court dismissed the claims against the Louisiana State Police on the grounds of being barred by the Eleventh Amendment, while retaining the claims against the superintendent in his official capacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 24, 2018, the former superintendent of the Louisiana State Police moved to dismiss the claims against him. The plaintiffs opposed on February 28, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion. The court dismissed in part the claims against him in an individual capacity for lack of personal participation, but maintained the claims against him in an individual capacity for failure to intervene.</p>\r\n<p>On January 24, 2018, certain Louisiana State Police troopers moved to dismiss the claims against them, which the plaintiffs opposed on February 28, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the court granted in part, denied in part, and deferred in part the motion. The court dismissed the claims against the troopers for excessive force, unlawful search and seizure, and conspiracy, because the plaintiffs failed to state a viable claim. The court deferred whether the plaintiffs stated a cognizable claim for other constitutional violations or that qualified immunity was overcome, because the court could not determine whether these particular defendants were liable.</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2018, the sheriff of the East Baton Rouge Parish moved to dismiss the claims against the East Baton Rouge Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The plaintiffs opposed on March 21, 2018, and the defendants replied in support of the motion on April 30, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the court granted in part, denied in part, and deferred in part the motion. The court dismissed the claims against the sheriff in his individual capacity for conspiracy, personal participation, custom of unlawful arrest and excessive force, and failure to train, supervise, and implement a policy, Pending limited discovery, the court deferred ruling on the sheriff&rsquo;s liability for some state law claims and whether a single policy decision had the moving force of a constitutional violation.In response to these rulings and further discovery, on November 6, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss so that the plaintiffs could file a new complaint that included only the officers against whom the plaintiffs had remaining claims. The new complaint was filed on November 14, 2019; it changed the list of defendants, removing the ones already mentioned and adding new defendants identified during discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2020, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, which the court denied without prejudice on July 30, 2020. Plaintiffs were reminded to &ldquo;re-urge&rdquo; their motion following the close of discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to resume discovery, which the court found moot on September 22, 2020. Originally, discovery was stayed pending the resolution of motions to dismiss for qualified immunity. As that issue was resolved, a scheduling conference order had already been issued to address the extent of permissible discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 2021, the defendants moved to dismiss the November 2019 complaint. On September 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a consent motion to voluntarily dismiss particular defendants from the case. The next day, on September 23, 2021, in consideration of the consent motion, the court granted the dismissal of 10 defendants with prejudice. The dismissed defendants were ordered to bear their own costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a consent motion for partial voluntary dismissal of certain claims. The court granted the consent motion on October 20, 2021, dismissing the claims with prejudice, and ordering each party to bear its own costs. Later that same day, the parties filed a notice of settlement for one of the plaintiffs. On October 21, 2021, the court approved the joint notice of settlement for that plaintiff, ordering the dismissal of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims without prejudice to the right, upon good cause, of the parties to reinstate the claims if the settlement was not consummated within sixty days. The parties bore their own costs, and once settlement was consummated the claims would be dismissed with prejudice. The details of the settlement were unknown to the Clearinghouse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2021, plaintiffs once again moved for partial summary judgment. The next day, on September 29, 2021, defendants moved for summary judgment. On July 14, 2022, the court issued orders on both motions. The court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on two claims, ordering the dismissal with prejudice of (1) claims against the BRPD police chief in his official capacity, and (2) claims for intentional infliction of emotional duress. The court found the official capacity claims against the police chief to be redundant to the claims against the city, and noted that the plaintiffs failed to oppose the dismissal or respond to the argument, which was effectively a waiver. As to the intentional infliction of emotional duress claims, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact about whether they experienced distress that no reasonable person could be expected to endure. On all other claims, the court denied both the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for partial summary judgment and defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, as they presented issues of fact for a jury to decide. This included claims regarding: Monell liability, qualified immunity, First Amendment generally, First Amendment protests, First Amendment freedom of press, First Amendment retaliation, false arrest, imprisonment, manufacturing of evidence, claims against individual officers, claims against the city, search and seizure, excessive force, failure to intervene, civil conspiracy, Louisiana constitution, negligent infliction of emotional distress, assault and battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, negligence, and vicarious liability and indemnity.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2023, the parties filed two consent motions to dismiss certain defendants. The court granted the motions on January 23, 2023, dismissing the specified defendants with prejudice and ordering each party to bear its own costs.</p>\r\n<p>Jury trial began on February 2, 2023. On February 15, 2023, before closing statements in the trial, the Baton Rouge Metro Council approved a $1.17 million settlement, inclusive of costs and attorneys fees. The following day, the court ordered a 60-day dismissal of the action without prejudice, pending the consummation of the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

The motion is DEFERRED in that Plaintiffs may have stated a cognizable \nclaim against these defendants for the other constitutional violations (First Amendment, retaliation, \nfalse arrest, and failure to intervene) and have potentially overcome qualified immunity.  However, \nthe Court cannot determine whether these particular defendants are liable for the Plaintiffsโ \nconstitutional violations.  Accordingly, the Court will allow limited written discovery on the \nidentities of the officers involved in making the arrests.  The Magistrate Judge will determine what \nlimited discovery will be allowed for this issue.   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 132    09/07/18   Page 2 of 2\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, with respect to Plaintiffsโ federal and state conspiracy \nclaims, the motion is GRANTED.

On July 5, 2016, Baton Rouge police officers shot Alton Sterling to death. \n2.  Mr. Sterling was a resident of Baton Rouge and the father of five children. His \ndeath was a tragedy, but not an aberration: in America in 2016, police killed at least one black \nman every forty hours.1  \n3.  In the days following Mr. Sterlingโs homicide, people gathered in Baton Rouge to \nspeak out about the pattern of police misconduct in Baton Rouge and the United States. Some of \nthem were Baton Rouge residents; others came from around Louisiana or other states to support \nthe community and to participate in the demonstrations. Reporters from all over the country and \nworld arrived to document the events. \n4.  On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led protest marched to the State Capitol \nbuilding, where participants spoke, sang, and prayed. Afterwards, the participants marched back \ndown Government Street. Where Government Street hits East Boulevard, law enforcement had \nset up a roadblock. Officers directed the marchers to get off of Government Street. The marchers \ncomplied and turned right onto East Blvd. A block down, the protesters stopped at the \nintersection of East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters gathered there and peacefully \nexercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n5.  Law enforcement officers by the score gathered across from the protesters, \n \n1 Fatal Force,The Washington Post. 2017. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 3 of 85\nwielding automatic weapons, body armor and gas masks, and an acoustic weapon mounted on an \narmored vehicle.2 Officers blocked off the streets around the protesters.  \n6.  Law enforcement ordered the protesters out of the streets, and most of the \nprotesters โ including Plaintiffs โ complied, stepping back onto the sidewalks.  \n7.  Law enforcement then ordered the protesters off the sidewalks, and most of the \nprotesters โ including Plaintiffs โ complied. They stepped back into the yard of Lisa Batiste, a \nwoman who had given them permission to use her property. \n8.  But law enforcement said โwhere you are standing isnโt good enough.โ They \nordered the protesters to disperse โ an impossible order to comply with, since the police blocked \noff most of the surrounding streets, had already ordered the protesters to stay off the sidewalks, \nand were arresting people who stepped into the streets to leave. \n \n2 The acoustic weapon is called an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device). LRADs were first \ndeveloped for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  LRADs are marketed to law enforcement for crowd control by creating discomfort when \nused at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can result in migraines, sinus pain, \ndizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as well as tinnitus and hearing loss.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 4 of 85\n \n \nFigure 1:    Plaintiff Raae Pollard peacefully protesting (left) and then lifted off the ground by \nher throat by Defendants (right). \n \n9.  Shortly thereafter, the officers swept in en masse, violently grabbing people and \nthrowing to the ground, pinning them, and binding their wrists painfully with plastic zipties. In \ntheir frenzy, the officers arrested a mix of protesters, reporters, and legal observers. The \narrestees, including Plaintiffs, were assembled into groups. Other officers wrote Affidavits of \nProbable Cause using pre-fabricated forms, most of which were written with facts from a \ndifferent event entirely. Plaintiffs were charged with โObstructing a Public Passagewayโ or \nโObstruction of a Highwayโ and โResisting Arrest.โ \n10.  Plaintiffs are thirteen protesters and two reporters arrested and jailed during this \npolice frenzy, even though they continuously complied with police orders and had done nothing \nwrong. Many Plaintiffs were injured. One Plaintiff was a 17-year-old girl put in an adult prison \nwith male inmates. One Plaintiff was separated from her children, including a five-year-old who \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 5 of 85\nwas taken from her and put into child protective services. \n11.  Defendantsโ arrest of peaceful protesters in Baton Rouge is not a new invention. \nIn 1961, the same story happened: Protesters gathered in Baton Rouge to speak out against racial \ninequality and law enforcement misconduct. They marched and then gathered on the sidewalks \nto make their voices heard. Baton Rouge police monitored the protest and then swept in to break \nup the protest. They arrested a man for alleged legal violations including โObstructing a Public \nPassageway.โ  \n12.  The man took his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court told the \nCity of Baton Rouge that its actions had violated the Constitution. It held in Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 U.S. 536, 558 (1965) (โCox Iโ) that it was โclearโ that Baton Rouge law enforcement \ncommitted a โunwarranted abridgment of [the protesterโs] freedom of speech and assembly \nsecured to him by the First Amendment.โ  \n13.  But Defendants did not learn from the Supreme Court's clear and unequivocal \nadmonishment. In 2016, they committed the same constitutional violations, using the same \ntactics, with some of the same criminal allegations. But this time, things are far worse: in 1961, \nDefendants arrested a single protester; in 2016, Defendants arrested approximately two hundred \nprotesters, reporters, and legal observers.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 6 of 85\nAn offic er watches protesters in Baton Rouge in 1961. \nFigure 2:  Officers watch protesters in 2016, shortly before \n(Source: It Happened in Baton Rouge, U.S.A.) The United \nillegally arresting them. The pictured protesters include \nStates Supreme Court decided that the arrest of a Baton \n \nPlaintiffs Blair Imani, Raae Pollard, and Akeem \nRouge protester that year was a โclearโ violation of First \nMohammad. \nAmendment rights. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). \n \n \n \n14.  This lawsuit focuses on three connected events that occurred on July 10, 2016. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the arrest of Tammy Cheney and her 17-year-old \ndaughter Alexus Cheney, and their separation from Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son A.J. and \ntheir dog Kelso. The third is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his \nwife Nadia Salazar Sandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. \nDefendantsโ actions that day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred \nafter July 10, 2016.   \n15.  Regarding the massive violation of constitutional rights that occurred on that day, \nBaton Rouge Police Department spokesman Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said that \"[a]nyone who feels \nthat something was unjustly done, they need to file a formal complaint.\"3  \n \n3 Maya Lau, Identical arrest reports for many Alton Sterling protesters a red flag, legal experts say. The \nAdvocate. Sept. 18, 2016. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 7 of 85\n16.  Plaintiffs know โthat something was unjustly done.โ Here, they accept \nMcKneely's invitation \"to file a formal complaint.\"  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1985(3), to vindicate \ntheir rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. Plaintiffs also bring supplemental state-law claims. This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, and 1367. \n18.  This case seeks remedies under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983, \nand 1988. \n19.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 as a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims arose in the Middle District of Louisiana. \nIII.   PARTIES \nA.

STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA Brief History of Defendantsโ Law Enforcement Misconduct \n61.  Baton Rouge law enforcement has a long history of misconduct and suppression \nof civil liberties. As described above, BRPDโs 1961 suppression of a peaceful protest and arrest \nof Reverend Elton Cox resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court opinion holding that it was โclearโ that \nRev. Coxโs First Amendment rights had been violated. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). \n62.  A year later, tensions between law enforcement and the Baton Rouge community \nescalated after the alleged killings of two Black students by EBRSO deputies at a protest on the \ncampus of Southern University in 1972. \n63.  In 1980, the City of Baton Rouge and several dozen other municipal defendants \nwere placed under a federal consent decree intended to remedy racially discriminatory hiring \npractices of a class of Louisiana police and fire departments, including the BRPD. In the decades \nsince, nearly every municipal defendant reached compliance with the consent decree and was \ndismissed from the case โ but not the City of Baton Rouge.  \n64.  In September of 2005, the population of Baton Rouge swelled as many residents \nof New Orleans, a majority Black city, sought refuge from Hurricane Katrina and the resultant \nflood. The Michigan State Police and New Mexico State Police both sent troopers to assist the \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 17 of 85\nBRPD in policing the cityโs rapidly growing population. \n65.  Within three days of the troopersโ arrival, both state police agencies had ordered \ntheir troopers to cease operations with BRPD after the troopers witnessed and complained of \negregious misconduct and potentially criminal actions by BRPD officers.  One state trooper from \nMichigan said Baton Rouge police attempted to thank him for his help by letting him \"beat \ndown\" a prisoner.5 A spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police told a reporter that โtroopers \nobserved Baton Rouge police officers engage in actions that were an affront to their sense of \ndignity and respect.โ \n66.  Members of both the Michigan State Police and the New Mexico State Police \nshared observations and concerns that were compiled in a formal letter of complaint to the \nBRPD.6 One Trooper reported that โI personally believe that most of the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment are good officers that are being directed by their supervisors to crack down on the \npublic. I donโt know if they have been given any type of direction as to what is right or wrong.โ7 \n67.  As writer Jarvis DeBerry put it: โSo that's what we're dealing with: a police \ndepartment whose behavior worried other law enforcement officials and whose leadership has \nbeen more defensive than responsive to the claims of racist policing.โ8 \n68.  Examples of reported BRPD misconduct included multiple instances of excessive \nforce, including force directed at minors, through the use of tasering, hitting, choking, and \npepper spraying of residents, without warning or threat to the safety of officers or civilians; \nsearches of individuals and their vehicles without reasonable suspicion or probable cause; and \npossibly falsifying information in police reports.   \n \n5 Jarvis DeBerry, Before killing Alton Sterling, Baton Rouge police had a history of brutality complaints, \nThe Times-Picayune, July 6, 2016. \n6 The report is attached here as Exhibit A.   \n7 Id. at 9.  \n8 DeBerry, supra. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 18 of 85\n69.  The Baton Rouge Police Department, under the direction of Defendant Holden \nand predecessors in office of Defendant Dabadie, also resisted efforts of media and public \ninterest advocates to gain information regarding these post-Katrina abuses, as part of an ongoing \neffort to cover up and conceal officer misconduct, and to promote the police code of silence.   \n70.  In 2006, as part of the effort to cover up and conceal allegations of race-based \nofficer misconduct and to promote the police code of silence, the City/Parish and the BRPD \nactively resisted public records requests and a Public Records Law enforcement action filed by \nThe Advocate newspaper seeking access to the Internal Affairs Division investigative report. \nDefendant Dabadieโs predecessor in office authorized a meritless countersuit to delay and \nthereby shield investigation records from public view, while imposing high costs on the \nnewspaper.  \n71.  Also in 2006, Defendant Mayor Kip Holden denied the NAACPโs suggestion of a \ncivilian oversight board for police.   \n72.  In 2011, then-BRPD Chief Dewayne White publicly stated that ten percent of the \ndepartmentโs officers failed to exercise basic levels of professionalism, and that โitโs become so \ningrainedโ in the minds of some officers that they โbelieve that everybody they come across or \nmost people they come across with that color of skin is probably a criminal.โ Defendant Mayor \nHolden fired Chief White in 2013 and hired Defendant Dabadie in his place. \n73.  In September 2014, a series of racist text messages sent by a BRPD officer to a \ncivilian were published.  In the messages, the officer, a fifteen-year veteran of the department, \nreferred both to Black colleagues and civilians with racial epithets, and stated, inter alia, โI wish \nsomeone would pull a Ferguson on them and take them out. I hate looking at those African \nmonkeys at work . . . I enjoy arresting those thugs with their saggy pants.โ \n74.  The officer was placed on administrative leave by BRPD and resigned before any \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 19 of 85\ndisciplinary action was taken against him by the Department. On information and belief, no \naction was taken by Holden, Dabadie or the City/Parish to determine the extent of similar \nattitudes among other BRPD officers. Defendant Dabadie stated publicly that there was no need \nto do so, because the issue was confined to the lone officer. Defendant Dabadieโs conclusion is \nbelied by more recent stories, including reporting that a White BRPD officer texted his \ncolleagues a picture of a chimpanzee and the phrase โchimp outโ in the context of the Alton \nSterling protests.9  \n75.  BRPD has also had a policy, practice, or custom of excessive use of force. Recent \nallegations include: \n(a) a 2007 arrest on a complaint of โloud musicโ with pepper spray and force that caused \nthe rupture of the arresteeโs bladder;  \n \n(b) a 2008 arrest for smoking marijuana that fractured the skull of the arrestee causing \ninternal bleeding and permanent brain damage;  \n \n(c) a 2011 incident in which an officer instructed a man, who advised the officer he was \nintoxicated, to move a vehicle away from the scene of the arrest; when the drunk driver \ncrashed the car, the officer shot him to death and shot a bystander in the arm;  \n \n(d) a 2014 incident in which BRPD officers strip-searched a visitor to a home which was \nbeing searched by the officers, then kicked the visitor with such force that his head \nslammed into the floor, knocking several teeth out of his mouth;  \n \n(e) a 2015 incident in which two members of the news media were handcuffed, and one \narrested, for taking pictures of an arrest;  \n \n(f) a 2016 incident caught on video in which a sixteen-year-old was held down by multiple \nofficers while one officer repeatedly punched him in the head;10 and  \n \n(g) the shooting death of Alton Sterling in July 2016.11  \n \n76.  In recent years, suits against the City/Parish for BRPDโs excessive uses of force \n \n9 Jim Mustian, Baton Rouge Officer suspended after alleged racial message about Alton Sterling protests, \nThe Advocate, May 22, 2017. \n10 DeBerry, supra. \n11 See Andricka Williams v. The City of Baton Rouge, 19th Judicial District Court. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 20 of 85\nand unconstitutional arrests have resulted in sizeable yearly settlements by the Parish Attorney. \nFor example, the City/Parish paid $372,434 to settle such cases in 2015, $581,286 in 2014, and \n$437,112 in 2011.   \n77.  Similar to BRPD, the East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office has its own history, \nextending decades before the July 2016 protests, of excessive force and unconstitutional arrests.  \nMore recently, allegations of excessive force and unconstitutional arrest leveled against EBRSO \nand Defendant Gautreaux have included multiple instances of excessive force through the \ninappropriate use of tasers, unconstitutional use of mace, and punching and kicking arrestees \nwithout justification.   Some of these allegations are documented in the following cases: Davis v. \nEast Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 08-00708 (M.D. La.) (resolved in private \nsettlement); Martinez v. Gautreaux, Civil Case No. 10-00847 (M.D. La.) (resolved in a private \nsettlement); Plaisance v. East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 16-00365 (M.D. La.) \n(ongoing). \n78.  During Defendant Edmonsonโs tenure, the Louisiana State Police have also \nexhibited excessive force and unconstitutional arrest. While LSP does not typically patrol \nmunicipalities, a pattern of unconstitutional excessive force and illegal arrest has rapidly \nemerged in the brief time that Defendant Edmonson has directed LSP in the provision of policing \nservices in the City of New Orleans.  Suits filed against the LSP since early 2013 allege that \nmembers of LSP, under the direction of Defendant Edmonson, have:  \n(a) physically and verbally abused two Black teenagers without provocation or lawful \njustification, desisting only when one of the teenโs mother, a New Orleans Police officer, \narrived and intervened;  \n \n(b) pulled over, shoved to the ground, kicked, and threatened with firearms internationally \nrenowned musician Shamarr Allen while searching for a Black drug dealer โ apparently \nbased solely on Allenโs race;  \n \n(c) manhandled, tased, and verbally and physically assaulted Michael Baugh, a Black \nbarber, causing significant injury, apparently based on his being of the same race as four \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 21 of 85\nsuspects (Baugh matched no other part of the suspectsโ description). \n \n79.  On information and belief, Defendant EDMONSON chose not to order a thorough \ninvestigation into these practices when they came to light; his inaction condones the falsification \nof information and the intimidation of witnesses to LSP troopersโ unconstitutional conduct. The \nLSP internal investigation into the LSP attack on the teenagers concluded that all of the troopers \ninvolved in the incident had acted appropriately, a conclusion that both the Mayor of New \nOrleans and the Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department publicly criticized based \non publicly available video of the incident. According to news reports, LSP went on to file a \ndisciplinary complaint with the NOPD against the mother of one of the teens for intervening on \nbehalf of her son and his friend. On information and belief, Defendant EDMONSON personally \nwrote a letter to the Superintendent of the NOPD requesting an investigation into the motherโs \nactions. \n80.  Some LSP arrest reports involving officer uses of force show that the LSP \ntroopers write up the arrest report and then later rewrite the report to add allegations of resisting \narrest. \nBRPD Shot and Killed Alton Sterling, the Community Began to Make Its Voice Heard,  \nand Law Enforcement Implemented a Plan to Silence Them \n \n81.   The July 5, 2016 killing of Alton Sterling was documented on video. The video \nshowed Mr. Sterling being forcibly restrained on the ground and then shot. Mr. Sterlingโs death \nprovoked local, national, and international outrage.  \n82.  By the evening of July 6, 2016, Baton Rouge residents gathered for daily and \nnightly vigils and peaceful protests at various locations throughout the city.  Some paid their \nrespects in front of the Triple S Food Mart where Mr. Sterling was killed. Many protested on a \nsizeable grassy lot on Airline Highway, across the street from the headquarters of the BRPD.  \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 22 of 85\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3:    Community members gather at the Triple S.  \n83.

In response to the large and growing protests and the national spotlight on \nprotestersโ nonviolent, lawful resistance, Defendants, led by Defendants Holden, Dabadie, \nEdmonson, Gautreaux and Cazes, developed and implemented a strategy. Their strategy was to \nsilence this peaceful and lawful exercise of First Amendment rights through intimidation, \nexcessive force, and illegal arrests and detention. Other law enforcement agencies not currently \nknown to Plaintiffs joined Defendants in this endeavor.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 23 of 85\n85.  Between July 8 and 10, 2016, Baton Rouge area law enforcement officers and \ntheir agents โ including BRPD, EBRSO, LSP, deputy sheriffs of surrounding parishes, and \nincluding but not limited to the currently unknown Law Enforcement DOES  - put this plan into \naction. In furtherance of the above objectives, the Defendants unlawfully arrested approximately \n200 protesters as they engaged in peaceful protest protected by \nthe First Amendment.  \n86.  At the same time, Defendants were \ndownplaying their response to protesters. โWe do not want to \nappear to have a military-style response,โ Defendant Dabadie \nsaid during a news conference early on July 9th, 2016. โWeโre \nthere, weโre around, and weโre keeping everything safe, but \nweโve tried to be respectful and reduce our presence at these \nFigure 4: Protester Javier Dunn was beaten so \nevents.โ12 As the arrests of peaceful protesters were \nbadly by Defendants on July 9, 2016 that his eye \nsocket was fractured. A sheriffโs employee told \noccurring, Defendant Col. Mike Edmonson said he thought \nhim โ'that's what y'all get when you protest.โ1 \n \nhis troopers โdid well.โ13     \n \n87.  But by the evening of Saturday, July 9th, Defenda nts had escalated their actions \n \ntowards the peaceful protesters. Huffington Post senior crime reporter David Lohr stated that \nโone thing I noticed today as opposed to yesterday is that [officers] were certainly more willing \nto pull their firearms out.โ He also reported that โ[a]n officer just pointed a machine gun at me . . \n. Iโm not quite sure what that female officer was doing; she pointed an assault rifle at us.โ14  \n88.  One witness reported that she heard โan order over the police radio: โI donโt care \n \n12 Amy Wold, Bryn Stole, and Maya Lau.

Protester Javier Dunn was arrested by Defendants and beaten so badly that they \nfractured his eye socket โ although his Affidavit of Probable Cause stated that he was arrested \nโwithout incident.โ One of Defendantsโ employees said โ'that's what y'all get when you \nprotest.โ16 \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5:    On July 9, 2016, Defendant Officer Cat points her assault rifle at protesters and a \n \nreporter.

On Sunday, July 10, 2016, the human rights group Amnesty International sent an \nopen letter to the Baton Rouge police department, urging it to use more restraint and respect the \n \n15 Affidavit of Yakeista Hughes.

Three primary incidents occurred that Sunday that give rise to Plaintiffsโ claims. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the separation and arrest of Tammy Cheney and her \n17-year-old daughter Alexus Cheney, and the seizure of Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son. The \nthird is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his wife Nadia Salazar \nSandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. Defendantsโ actions \nthat day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred after July 10, 2016. \nPlaintiffs Were Arrested at the Peaceful Protest at France Blvd. and East St.,  \nEven Though They Continuously Complied With Law Enforcement Orders  \n \n93.  On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led march to the State Capitol was organized. \nParticipants marched from a church to the Capitol, and then gave speeches on the steps of the \nCapitol building.  \n \n \n \n \n18 Id. \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 26 of 85\n \nFigure 6:    Heads are bowed at the prayerful protest on the steps of the state capitol building.  \n94.  Afterwards, the participants marched back down Government Street. When they \nreached the intersection of Government Street and East Boulevard, they had to stop because law \nenforcement had set up a roadblock. The officers directed the marchers to get off of Government \nStreet.  \n95.  At about 5:40 p.m., the marchers complied and turned right onto East Blvd. A \nblock down, the protesters stopped and gathered at East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters \nthere peacefully exercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 27 of 85\n \nFigure 7:    Plaintiffs Raae Pollard, Blair Imani, and Akeem Muhammad make their voices heard at \n \nEast & France.  \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \nFigure 8:    Plaintiff Blair Imani stops to pray.  \n96.

Around 6:00 p.m., legal observers saw police staging at the end of Europe \nStreet.19  Shortly thereafter they saw approximately 40 to 50 police officers form a military-like \nformation on France Street, including an armored vehicle operated by an officer with a rifle.20 \nFigure 9:    A still image from a video shows Defendants in tactical gear blocking France Street. The \narmored vehicle with a mounted LRAD acoustic weapon is behind the officers. \n \n98.  Professor Bill Quigley, an attorney and law professor at Loyola University New \nOrleans, was present as a legal observer.  He introduced himself to an officer and was directed to \ntalk with the officer in charge.21  When Professor Quigley asked the officer how he could help, \nhe was told to tell people they had to clear the street in ten minutes or law enforcement was \ngoing to start arresting people. Professor Quigley and another legal observer relayed this \ninformation to the protestors. Most of the protesters complied and began leave the street. \n99.

On video, Plaintiff Victor Onuoha pointed out how they are surrounded โ he said \nthere are police โleft, right, and dead in front of us.โ  \n106. Defendants then gave conflicting instructions, telling protestors both to (1) \ndisperse because their assembly was now unlawful and (2) that people in the street and on \nsidewalks would be arrested.28 (This is conflicting because use of the streets and sidewalks \nwould be necessary to disperse.) On video, Defendants can be heard to order the protesters on \nprivate property that โyou must leave now.โ29 But they also told the protesters: โ[Y]ou cannot \nleave. If you try to step into the street, we will arrest you.โ30 Some protesters who attempted to \nleave the area were chased, tackled, tasered, and arrested.31  \n107. On video, the police can be heard to say: โwe understand you want to protest, but \nthis is not the time or place.โ32 They did not, however, give any indication what the proper time \nor place to protest was, or why this time and place was not permitted.  \n108. Although the character of the protest had not changed,33 law enforcement \nannounced via megaphone: โTHIS IS NO LONGER A PEACEFUL PROTEST.โ34  \n109. One protester, Crystal Williams, described the situation: \nMany protesters froze when the police started arresting folks.

When she heard about the death of Alton Sterling in July 2016, Tammy was \ntraveling through Louisiana with her seventeen-year-old daughter Alexus, her five-year-old son \nA.J., and their dog Kelso. They had been exploring the country, seeing historic landmarks and \nnatural sights, and were on their way back home to North Carolina.  \n134. Partly because of her personal experience, Tammyโs heart went out to the Sterling \nfamily when she heard of Altonโs death. She wanted to stand with them. She also wanted to give \nher children a way to understand what was happening. \n135. So on July 8, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended a peaceful protest in New \nOrleans about the shooting.  It was the first protest any of them had ever been to. Hundreds of \npeople gathered in Lee Circle to make their voices heard. NOPD monitored the situation, but \nallowed the protesters to exercise their First Amendment rights without interference or arrests.55 \n136. The New Orleans protest was so moving that the family decided to attend the \nchildren-led march planned for that Sunday in Baton Rouge.  \n137. On July 10, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended the peaceful protest at the \nstate capitol building in Baton Rouge. Alexus described it later as being โsurrounded by so much \nlove and peace.โ After the protest, they marched back to the church where they had begun, ate \nsome food, and then got back in their car intending to continue their trip to North Carolina.  \n138. They followed the route Google Maps told them to take, but when they got to East \nBlvd. and Government St., the police had blocked off the road. So they pulled into a parking lot \n \n55 Wilborn P.

Alexus decided to go around the corner to videotape what was happening. Tammy \nstayed at the car with A.J., standing on her car and holding up a sign with a political quote on it.  \n140. Alexus joined the protest at East and France. When she \nheard the police tell everyone to get on the sidewalk, she moved to the \nsidewalk. Then she heard the police say if they were on the sidewalk, they \nwould be arrested, so Alexus moved into Ms. Batisteโs yard. Then she \nheard the police order the protest to disperse, so she left and returned to the \ncar and joined her mother.  \n141. Tammy began to see officers with gas masks and shields \ngoing down the road. She told A.J. to get in the car and lock the doors. \nAlexus returned to the car. Tammy told her โAlexus, get in the car and Iโll \nbe right back โ Iโm going to take a couple more pictures and then weโll  Figure 19: Alexus is dragged \naway from the car where she was \nleave.โ She walked a short distance from the car to videotape the scene.  watching her five-year-old brother \nA.J. and her dog Kelso.  \nAccording to a witness, Tammy stepped away from the car for no \nmore than a โminute, minute and a half.โ56  \n142.

A few minutes later, Tammy and Alexus were seated on a curb together, along \nwith other women waiting to be taken to the prison. With her hands cuffed behind her back, \nTammy tried to console her sobbing daughter.58  \n149. Tammy and Alexus and the other arrested protesters asked the officers to look \ninto the car to make sure A.J. was okay. One of the officers asked Tammy and Alexus, โdid you \nlearn your lessonโ and refused to investigate to see if A.J. was okay until Tammy and Alexus \nsaid โyesโ they had learned their lesson.59  \n150.

Tammy and Alexus were taken to a holding cell, where they were held for \napproximately eight hours. Then they were split up and put into general population of the East \nBaton Rouge Prison. The prison was cold, and they were given no blankets. In Tammyโs cell, the \nwomen huddled together under a mattress for warmth. They were given no toilet paper.  \n153. Despite Alexus being a juvenile, she was held in an adult facility. She was strip-\nsearched and forced to squat and cough. The cell near hers contained adult men.  She was \nexposed to pepper spray, and heard a male inmate being tasered because the male inmates had \nbeen clapping when women were released.

Her mother had not been \nreleased yet, and Alexus was terrified. She was seventeen, abandoned in a strange city, and \nseparated from her mother, her brother, her dog, and their car. She told Defendants โIโm only \nseventeen โ you canโt just put me outside and leave me!โ They said to be quiet and that it wasnโt \ntheir problem. She had to wait seven hours until her mother was released at around midnight.  \n156. Although Tammy and Alexus got out of prison on July 11, they could not get A.J. \nback immediately. Defendants interfered with the process of them getting A.J. back. While \nTammy and Alexus were in the prison, Defendants barred the Child Protective Services worker \nassigned to A.J.โs case from visiting Tammy and Alexus. Defendant Lapeyrous untruthfully told \nthe Child Protective Services worker that A.J. had been โfound locked in his motherโs car at \nGovernment St. and East Blvd. while the parents went to the demonstration. Both parents are \nbeing arrested.โ  \n157. It was not until July 13, 2016 that Tammy got A.J. \nback with the help of a pro bono attorney. On that day, Tammyโs \nattorney showed video of the incident to the Assistant District \nAttorney in family court. Immediately after seeing the video, the \nADA said the case would be thrown out. Within fifteen minutes, \nJudge Pamela Taylor-Johnson ordered the state to immediately \nreturn A.J. to Tammy.60  \n158. A.J., being only five, did not understand what had  Figure 22: On July 13, 2016, the family \nis finally reunited: Alexus, A.J., Tammy, \nand their attorney Adrian Ross.  \nhappened. He had heard on the radio about the killing of Alton \n \n \n60 Savage, supra. \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 44 of 85\nSterling. And so when he saw police taking his mother and sister away, he thought that the police \nwere going to kill them.61 When Tammy and her son were finally reunited, the first thing she told \nhim was โI told you momma would never leave you, I would always be back to get you if \nsomething happened.โ62 Seeing the fear that A.J. had been through was traumatizing to Tammy \nand Alexus. \n159. Even their dog Kelso was traumatized. He is now skittish around strangers or loud \nnoises.63 \nThe Take-Down of Antonio and Nadia \n160. On July 10, 2016, Antonio and Nadia drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to \npeacefully protest and show support for other people of color. They participated in the youth-\norganized march to the state capitol building, and then stayed afterwards to help clean up the \narea and provide water and snacks to community members. Then they returned to the office of \nthe Baton Rouge Youth Coalition to reflect on the dayโs events.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 23: Plaintiff Antonio Castanon Luna (left) poses at the Capitol \nprotest with two youth leaders. \n \n \n61 Id.  \n62 Id. \n63 Id. \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 45 of 85\n161. Someone gave Antonio and Nadia a ride back to their car, near the interstate on \nGovernment Street. Because law enforcement had closed several streets in the area, they \nhad to be dropped off several blocks away. As they were walking back to their car, they \nencountered the militarized police unit at the intersection of East Blvd and France Street.  \n162. They watched as the police escalated their activities against the protesters, and \nAntonio and Nadia joined the protesters in retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. They watched as \nofficers in full riot gear charged at the demonstrators, violently throwing them on the ground and \ndragging them away towards militarized vehicles. At this point, Antonio and Nadia feared for \ntheir lives, and rushed away towards safety, exiting Ms. Batisteโs property through the back \ngate.  They made their way to the sidewalk at the corner of Government Street and Maximillian \nSt. Officers there were blocking off Maximillian Street Southbound and then Government Street \nEastbound and Westbound. \n163.  Antonio and Nadia stopped to look for a \nfriend so that they could get in their car and leave. \nWhile waiting for their friend, they led chants. For \nexample, Antonio chanted โyou canโt serve and protect \nwith war weapons.โ Nadia was holding onto the pole of \na stop sign, because she believed that by standing there \nthey were complying with the officersโ orders and were \nsafe from arrest.  \n164. All of a sudden, several officers in riot \ngear, including Defendants Alan Hamilton, Brandon \nFigure 24: Nadia and Antonio (red circle) holding onto \nBlust, and James Crockett, tackled Nadia and  the street sign post as an officer (right) tackles Nadia \nfrom behind. The video, from MSNBC, can be \ndownloaded here and is incorporated into this complaint.  \nAntonio to the ground, hard. Officers piled onto \n \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 46 of 85\nthem, held them down, and ziptied their hands. During this tackle, the officers wrenched \nAntonioโs ankle and knee.  \n165. Bystanders asked the officers why \nAntonio and Nadia were being arrested, since \nthey hadnโt been in the street. It seemed that they \nwere targeted because they had been leading \nchants. Bystanders can be heard on video asking \nโwhat did he do?โ64 \n166. Only after Antonio and Nadia \nwere tackled to the ground can officers be heard \non video ordering bystanders to โclear the \nFigure 25: Five officers tackle Antonio and Nadia to the \nground. \nsidewalk.โ65 A witness can be heard to say that \n \nAntonio โwas just standing there. He was just \nstanding there.โ66 A dozen or more people \ncontinued to stand on the sidewalk right by where \nAntonio and Nadia were standing; none of them \nare arrested.67 A witness says โit was clear, it was \nvery clear. [Antonio] was specifically targeted.โ68  \nFigure 26: Nadiaโs face is pushed to the ground next to \n167. The zipties were so tight that \nan officerโs foot as Defendants ziptie her hands.

As the officers walked Nadia and Antonio to some large vehicles, Antonio asked \nwhy they were being arrested. An officer responded, โI donโt know.โ70 An officer bent Nadiaโs \narms and said โAlton Sterling was a murderer.โ  \n169. As Nadia and Antonio were separated, Nadia was terrified, but told Antonio, \nโbaby, I love you, Iโm fine.โ But privately she thought that this was perhaps the last time she \nwould see her husband. \n170. As she was being walked away, Nadia heard an officer say โtake her the long \nway.โ She didnโt know what this meant, but it caused her to fear for her life โ and so she began \nyelling her name and birth date to ensure that she was not disappeared. \n171. Antonio heard an officer tell a protester to โshut your mouth, or get your head \nbashed in.โ Antonioโs ankle began to swell so much that his shoe was cutting off blood flow. He \nasked for medical attention but was ignored by the officers.  \n172. They were loaded into vans and transported to the jail, but not seat-belted. \n173. At the jail, an officer asked Antonio for his information to write him up. The \nofficer said that he was really confused and didnโt know how to properly proceed since he wasnโt \nthere for Antonioโs arrest, did not know the place or time of arrest, and didnโt know how the \nsituation unfolded. Antonio pointed out his ankle injury again, but was not treated. \n174. Nadia was strip-searched twice at the prison, and required to remove her bra. A \nwhite woman asked to keep her bra, and the guard said yes. Nadia asked to keep her bra, and the \nguard said no. Nadia was given no blanket in the cold jail cells. She was exposed to mace when \nofficers maced a nearby cell .  \n175. At the prison, law enforcement officers spelled her name differently on different \n \n70 Id.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 48 of 85\nforms. She recalls the following variations: Madye Salvar, Nadye Salva, Nadia Salvar, and the \ncorrect Nadia Salazar Sandi. \n176. At one point at the prison, a guard came and requested volunteers.  Antonio had \nno idea what would happen next, but stood up and requested medical attention. The guard told \nhim to shut up and get in the volunteer line. Another protester told the guard that Antonio needed \nto get my ankle looked at and the guard replied โyes, I heard him already.โ \n177. According to the sworn statement of protester Julien Bond, โI noticed at this time \nthat one other arrestee โ Antonio โ requested medical care because his ankle was swollen from \nbeing dragged but his request was ignored.โ71 \n178. At approximately midnight, Antonio was taken to the doctorโs station. He told \nnurses what happened to his ankle, and they gave him a leaky bag of ice. A doctor swung by but \nsaid he couldnโt help because he didnโt have the time. Antonio was given some anti-\ninflammatories. The doctor came by again later, looked at the ankle, and said โthis is not good.โ \nAfter the ice melted, Antonio was made to sign a medical form and was taken back to the area \nwith the holding cell.    \n179. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country with a history of violence and \ninjustice. But she says that โeven with all the oppression in Bolivia, I donโt remember anything \nlike what I experienced in Baton Rouge.โ  \nPlaintiffs Were Arrested with Perjurious Affidavits of Probable Cause  \nThat are Facially False and Contradictory  \n \n180. After being seized by Defendants, Plaintiffs were assembled into groups with \nother arrestees.  Other officers โ not the ones that had grabbed them โ wrote Plaintiffs up using \npre-printed affidavits. Each Plaintiff was written up for two crimes โ โResisting Arrestโ (R.S. \n \n71 NRBM v. BR, R. Doc. 2-4 at 7. \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 49 of 85\n14:108) and either โObstruction of a Highwayโ (R.S. 14:97) or โObstruction of a Public \nPassagewayโ (R.S. 14:100.1).72  \n181. The primary difference between the two obstruction statutes is that 14:100.1 \ncriminalizes blocking roads and sidewalks, while 14:97 only applies to roads. There is no \ncorrelation, however, between where the Plaintiff was standing when arrested and which crime \nthey were charged with. \n182. According to The Advocate, for โ132 of the 176 incident reports of protesters \nprovided by the Baton Rouge Police Department, police used one of two versions of boilerplate \nlanguage.โ73 This was a red flag for LSU law professor Scott Sullivan, who reviewed the \naffidavits obtained by The Advocate:  \nProbable cause requires not just the sense that a defendant may have committed a \ncrime, but that this particular defendant at a particular time and place committed a \nparticular crime  . . .What seems to be missing is a careful consideration of this \nparticular defendant's actions . . . That sense [that a crime was committed]  is \nundermined when you just see a repeated narrative over and over again without much \ndeviation.74 \n \n183. Thirteen of Plaintiffsโ affidavits of arrest have been obtained from the Clerk of \nCourt. (The clerk has no affidavit for Plaintiffs Victor Onuoha and Nadia Salazar Sandi.) The \naffidavits are facially false and contradictory for reasons including the following: \na. False Location. The affidavits were pre-written with facts that described an incorrect \nlocation. Eleven of the thirteen affidavits say that the protests were โin the vicinity of \nBaton Rouge Police Departmentโs Headquarters at 9000 Airline Highway.โ Plaintiffs \nwere actually arrested nearly six miles away, in the vicinity of East Blvd. and France St. \n \n72 See Exhibit C to this Complaint. \n73 Maya Lau, Identical arrest reports for many Alton Sterling protesters a red flag, legal experts say. The \nAdvocate.

No Parking Lots. All thirteen affidavits say โProtesters assembled at provided parking \nareas and in surrounding parking lots.โ There is no parking lot at East and France. \nc. Wrong Address for BRPD HQ. Four of the affidavits have โ9000 Airline Highwayโ \ncrossed out and replaced with โ500 East Blvd.โ This renders these affidavits even more \ncontradictory, because the affidavits then read โin the vicinity of Baton Rouge Police \nDepartmentโs Headquarters located at 500 East Blvd.โ โ which is not the BRPD \nHeadquartersโ location.  \n   \nFigure 29: Excerpt from Affidavit for Blair Imani, showing address \n  crossed out. The resulting affidavit is false โ BRPDโs headquarters is \nnot at 500 East Blvd. \nd. Felonious Misdemeanors? Each of the affidavits says the โDefendant did knowingly \nand feloniouslyโ violate R.S. 14:97 or 14:100.1. Both those statutes, however, describe \nmisdemeanors. \ne. False Description of Plaintiffโs Conduct. Each of the affidavits says: โDuring the \nprotest, the Defendant entered the roadway and was provided another verbal order to \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 51 of 85\nexit the lanes of travel. Moments later the Defendant entered the roadway again and was \ntaken into custody by Officers on the scene.โ This is not a true description of the seizure \nof any Plaintiff.  \nf.  Contradictory Statutes. Two of the affidavits are contradictory as to what crime is \nbeing alleged. In the synopsis, they say the Plaintiff violated โLRS 14:97,โ but \nelsewhere 14:97 is crossed out and replaced with 14:100.1. \n   \nFigure 30:   For two of the Affidavits, the officer was inconsistent \nabout what crime was being alleged.  \n \ng. False Statements About Miranda Rights. Each affidavit says the defendant was \nโverbally advised of their rights per the Miranda ruling.โ This is false โ Plaintiffs were \nnot all read their Miranda rights. Some Plaintiffs even asked to be read their rights, but \nwere refused.  \nh. One Consistent Truth: Affidavits Say The Protests Were Peaceful. One thing is true \nabout every affidavit: every single one of them describes the protests as โpeaceful.โ   \n            Figure 31: Excerpt from Affidavit for Raae Pollard \nThe Aftermath \n184. Defendantsโ illegal plan to silence the communityโs voice was disturbingly \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 52 of 85\nsuccessful. There were no more major protests following the dozens of seizures, beatings, and \narrests of protesters on Sunday, July 10. Defendantsโ efforts had the actual effect of chilling the \ncommunityโs exercise of its First Amendment rights.  This is clear from contemporaneous \nstatements by protesters:  \na.  โSince the protest, I have not been able to shake a feeling of fear and \nsadness. To be immediately in front of a police force that wields so much \npower and to know that they do not respect the law, makes it feel impossible \nto protest.โ75  \n \nb.  โI am too afraid to return to Baton Rouge. I was so scared the entire time. \nWe didnโt come to get arrested. We didnโt come to get killed. We just came \nto protest and to get justice for Eric. They treated us so badly.โ76 \n \nc.  โAfter all this, I am now aware of the incredibly high risk of protesting. I \nwas definitely afraid.โ77  \n \nd.   โI had planned to protest in upcoming marches, though will likely not do so \nin the future. I have been dissuaded by the reports of arrested \nprotestorsโฆโ78  \n \n185. Even the trained Legal Observersโ activities were chilled: โBecause of the actions \nof the police I was very afraid someone would get shot or \nthat they would tear gas us. The police were arresting \nLegal Observers as well as civilians. It is frightening to \nthink about Legal Observing in the aftermath of what I \nwitnessed.โ79 Sister McCrary reported that โI am terrified \nto try to negotiate with the police again in Baton Rouge.

Shortly after the protests, the United Nations Special Rapporteur On The Rights \nTo Freedom Of Peaceful Assembly And Of Association made a visit to Baton Rouge. On July \n27, 2016, he spoke out against the law enforcement practices in Baton Rouge: โIt is manifestly \nunwise to respond to a largely peaceful, grieving crowd with riot gear, random arrests, flimsy \ncharges, rough physical handling, verbal insults and so forth. This is not only a violation of the \nright to peaceful assembly, it also dangerous for participants, the general public and police \nofficers. \n187. By July 31, 2016, the East Baton Rouge District \nAttorney had posted an ACLU guide entitled โKnow Your \nRights:  Demonstrations and Protestsโ to the District \nAttorneyโs website.81 The guide emphasized that โGenerally, \nall types of expression are constitutionally protected in \ntraditional โpublic forumsโ such as streets, sidewalks and \nFigure 33: The District Attorney posts on \nparks.โ It added that โthe First Amendment prohibits [advance  his website the ACLU guide to peaceful \nprotesting, which says โIf marchers stay on \nthe sidewalks and obey traffic and pedestrian \nnotice permit requirements] from being used to prevent rallies \nsignals, their activity is constitutionally \nprotected even without a permit.โ \nor demonstrations that are rapid responses to unforeseeable and \n \nrecent events.โ The guide explained: \nIf organizers have not obtained a permit, where can a march take place?  \nIf marchers stay on the sidewalks and obey traffic and pedestrian signals, their \nactivity is constitutionally protected even without a permit. \n \n188. A government spokesperson even admitted that protesters had been targeted for \narrest based on their speech: โI think the law enforcement folks have a strategy of identifying \n \n80 Aff. of Alison McCrary, NRBM, R.

Despite the widespread consensus that there was a problem with law \nenforcementโs handling of the protesters, Defendant Louisiana State Police Col. Mike Edmonson \ndenied that his troopers had done anything wrong. He said that they โused incredible restraintโ in \ntheir response to protesters83 and said โI was certainly pleased with what I saw here.โ84  \n190. But Lt. General Russel L. Honore, the retired U.S. Army leader who coordinated \nmilitary response efforts after Hurricane Katrina, felt differently. After reviewing hours of \nvideos, imagery and other coverage of protests in Baton Rouge, he said:  \nThe gas masks themselves were pretty intimidating . . . My concern is, with those homes \nthere and all the people in the houses, that would not have been a good place to do (show \nthat weaponry), particularly when the protesters werenโt being violent.  . . . Something is \nnot right in that department in terms of amount of equipment and amount of training.85 \n \n191. A year after the protests, Defendant Dabadie acknowledged problems with the \nJuly 2016 handling of protests. He said โWe were not perfect in the first round of the protests, \nand we had some things that we needed to correct.โ86 But Defendants have said they will respond \nto future protests in much same way,87 albeit with some โtacticalโ changes.88   \n192.

When the police rushed Ms. Batisteโs yard, Blair and Akeem were grabbed and \nthrown to the ground. Sister Alison McCrary witnessed \na โgroup of officers tackle [Blair], pull off her hijab \nhead scarf, and arrest her.โ92 Blair and Akeem were \ntrampled by officers as they lay on the ground. \n196. Defendants knelt on Akeemโs neck and \nback to hold him down, even though he was compliant \nwith his fingers splayed open.93 \nFigure 35: Yellow circles show Akeem and Blair \n197.

The two of them complied with police orders to clear the streets and \nsidewalks. Raae was especially concerned about following their orders, because she is a green \ncard holder from Australia.  \n201. When Raae was on the yard, police said โwhere youโre standing is not good \nenough.โ But Raae didnโt understand what she was supposed to do โ she was on private property \nand surrounded by police.  She waited to get more specific directions from the officers. Raae and \nSami were standing on Ms. Batisteโs lawn when they were grabbed by Defendants. When she \nwas grabbed, Raae let her body go limp, like a ragdoll, to put up no resistance to the officers. \nRaae turned and saw Samiโs head smashed into the road.  A witness wrote that she โsaw Raae \nthrown to the ground, then Sami smashed on to pavement, tackled with the force of a \nlinebacker.โ \n202.

She wrote: \nโ[Sami] sustained a concussion due to a female police \nofficer, who had brandished her assault rifle at peaceful \nprotestors, stomping on her face on the ground.โ She \nsaid that the officer she saw was wearing a purple shirt \nand had a photo in The Advocate on July 11, 2016.  \n204. The officers who seized Raae and Sami \ndid not write them up. The officers had forgotten who  Figure 36: Sami being arrested Cpl. Mancuso, \nwho stomped on Samiโs head and said \ngrabbed who, and so they split up the arrestees at  โtrashy bitch . . . go back to \nCalifornia.โ \n \n \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 58 of 85\nrandom. Raaeโs zip ties were so tight that she almost fainted. They had to be removed by \nofficers.  \n205. As a result of Defendantsโ violence Sami suffered a head injury, and was passing \nin and out of consciousness. Once they were detained at the prison, a witness said that \nโsometime around 10:30 pm, a medic in blue scrubs came by, poked him head into the cell, and \nsaid โeveryoneโs fine.โโ Blair Imani, who had EMT training, was concerned that Sami might \nhave a concussion. When the medic returned she asked him to look at Sami and do a state of \nconsciousness test. Blair specifically told the medic that she thought Sami might have a \nconcussion. The medic said โโIโm not the hospitalโ and walked away.โ94  \n206. The day after they were released, Sami and Raae went to University Medical \nCenterโs emergency room. They gave Sami pain medicine and muscle relaxers. Raaeโs father in \nAustralia had a panic attack when he saw the news, which terrified Raae.  \n207. Tammy Cheney. Tammy was mistreated by Defendants as described above. \n208.  Two days after her arrest, Tammy said โThis experience scared the daylights out \nof me, and I will never go to a protest again.โ95 She has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Complex and Major Depressive, Recurrent, Severe Without Psychosis. She has \nbeen prescribed bi-weekly individual therapy. As of November 2016, her licensed clinical social \nworker assessed that she could not work at all โdue to the severity of emotional and cognitive \nimpairments.โ The social worker estimated that the impact of the condition on Tammyโs ability \nto work would be expect to last โ[m]ore than 12 months.โ \n209. On October 9, 2016, Tammy shared the following description of her feelings with \nher friends: \nEvery day is a mental struggle. I convince myself daily that im ok and am \n \n94 Aff. of Marina Sparagana, NRBM, R. Doc. 2-8 at 21 \n95 NRBM, R.

I cant watch anything that reminds \nme of that time, without feel the devastation that i went through all that crap. \nI dont trust anyone. Walking in fear constantly, got robbed for 350$ the \nother day trying to move into new place and it was a scam on Craigslist and \ncouldn't call cops to report it, because im scared to death of police and what \nthey are capable of doing. Sorry to through all this on you. But it is all i \nhave on my mind \n \n210. Alexus Cheney. Alexus was mistreated by Defendants as described above. \nAlexus, though only seventeen, was housed in an adult prison with both male and female \ninmates. She was required to take off all her clothes, squat and cough, during a strip-search. \n211. As a result of everything that happened to her, Alexus has struggled with post-\ntraumatic stress. She has suffered from depression and anxiety, and says that she has โlost a lot \nof competence.โ She has been asking herself, \"What is wrong with us? What did we do to \ndeserve this?\" As a result of these impacts, she dropped out of school. She tried to get a GED but \ncouldnโt. The incident has affected her relationship with her mother.  \n212. Victor Onuoha. Victor was a thirteen-year resident of Baton Rouge, and had just \nmoved to Gretna before Alton Sterling was shot. On July 10, Victor drove with his girlfriend to \nbe a part of the march to the capitol. Afterwards, they parked and then joined the protest at the \npoint when people were retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. He was standing in Ms. Batisteโs yard \nwhen he was arrested by Defendants.   \n213. Antonio Castanon Luna and Nadia Salazar Sandi. Antonio and Nadiaโs arrests \nhave caused lasting problems for them. Due to her trauma of being in a cold jail cell, Nadia now \nbecomes afraid when she gets cold, and shakes at night. Nadia has had trouble sleeping and has \nhad nightmares. Because her arrest was televised, it causes Nadia a great deal of stress to know \nthat the cousin she raised saw her getting arrested. \n214. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country that has historically used police force \nto stop peaceful protesters. She did not expect to experience the same thing in โthe land of the \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 60 of 85\nfree.โ As a result, she has found herself more cautious about speaking out about things after her \narrest, even on social media. She says โI feel like my first amendment right was stripped from \nme from that day on.โ \n215. Antonio has had lasting problems with his knee and ankle, and has had to seek \nmedical treatment repeatedly. He has felt anxiety, especially when reflecting on his arrest or \nwhen participating in public demonstrations. \n216. Due to the traumatic events of July 10 and 11, Antonio and Nadia decided to \nmove back to Maryland to be closer to family. This was expensive and difficult as they had been \nbuilding a life in New Orleans.  \n217. Despite the way they were treated in Baton Rouge, Antonio and Nadia returned to \nhelp the communities afflicted by the August 2016 floods. They helped prepare flood-damaged \nhomes for rebuilding. They passed out clothes and other essential items.  \n218. Karen Savage. Karen Savage is a reporter with the Juvenile Justice Information \nExchange (โJJIEโ). In July 2016, Karen and her photographer Marco Poggio were on assignment \nfor JJIE, covering youth reactions to the killing of Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police officers \nBlane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.96  She had a press pass from the CUNY Graduate School of \nJournalism.  \n219. On July 9, she and her team reported from the Triple S market where Mr. Sterling \nhad been killed. That evening, she observed the protest at Airline Highway. She observed a \nshort, white female officer with an assault rifle. She observed that the female officer โhad it up \nand was aiming it at the protesters and waving it back and forth.โ \n220. On July 10, while Marco edited video, Karen spent the morning and early \n \n96 Karen Savage, Reporter Recounts Arrest, Prison Stay After Baton Rouge Protest.

They missed the capitol \nprotest due to traffic, and arrived to observe the protestors once they had assembled at East Blvd. \nand France Street. She saw officers wearing combat gear with a tank-like vehicle. Despite having \nreported on and attended dozens of protests, Karen had never seen a police response anywhere \nclose in kind to what she saw in Baton Rouge. She wrote: \nIโd been to protests in New York, Boston and elsewhere and have encountered \nheavily armed police. Iโd seen armored vehicles and heard LRADs before. But never \nbefore had I witnessed officers risking the safety of so many, including themselves \nโ not on the Mass Turnpike in Boston, not in Times Square and not more recently \non Fifth Avenue in New York City, where I had covered anti-police brutality protests \nbefore being sent down to Louisiana. In Baton Rouge, it seem as if the police came \nready for war.97 \n \n221. She watched the protesters mostly comply with police orders to clear the streets \nand sidewalks. Once the police ordered the protesters to disperse and started making arrests, \nKaren moved away towards the McDonalds a few blocks away, taking pictures as she went.98 \n222. She was walking towards the door of the McDonaldโs when an officer grabbed \nher from behind and shoved her to the ground. โAre you resisting?โ he asked. โI'm a journalist, \nmy credentials are in my right pocket, you can take them out,โ Karen said, using the calmest \nvoice she could muster. She feared to put her hands into her pockets herself.  โFuck you, \njournalist,โ he shouted from behind Karenโs ear. โYou donโt listen.โ  Eventually, Karen stopped \nsaying she was a journalist because this seemed to make the officer angrier.  \n223. The officers ziptied her hands together โ so tight that her hands hurt, then went \nnumb, and then began to change color. โCould you loosen it a little? Please,โ Karen asked. \nโWhich one hurts?โ he replied. She nodded silently toward her left hand, then puffy and bluish \nred. He grabbed the plastic cuff on her right hand, grunted, and pulled it tighter. \n \n97 Id. \n98 NRBM, R. Doc. 2-8.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 62 of 85\n224. Another officer showed her a large serrated knife and jokingly offered to use it on \nher. Karen heard someone yell her name and she turned to see a friend up the block. She tried to \nshout her editor's email address to the friend, but the pain made it hard to remember. โShut up, or \nwe'll arrest her, too,\" said the officer with the knife. The officer who first grabbed her said again, \nโFuck you, journalist.โ \n225. Karen was handed off to another officer. The pain in her hands had become so \nintense that Karen began to get dizzy. Another officer said \"What the hell did they do to you?\" \nand got an officer to bring clippers to cut the zipties. The officer told her she had to hold still and \nthen rammed the tool under the plastic tie. The edges of Karenโs vision grew dim and she could \nhear herself scream. Finally, the left cuff popped off, then the right. Karen could breath again. \nThe officer quickly pulled back Karenโs hands and put on more ties. They were still painful, but \nnot excruciating like the last pair. \n226. While waiting for police transport, Karen met Tammy and Alexus. Tammy said \npolice told her she would be charged with abandonment of her son, who would be turned over to \nLouisianaโs Department of Social Services. Karen turned her head to hide the tears she felt \nrolling down her face. \n227. As she talked, Karen noticed the curb felt oddly smooth and cold in the heat. Then \nshe realized she wasnโt feeling the curb at all โ her hand had gone numb. \n228. Karen and thirteen other people were transported to East Baton Rouge Police \nParish in an over-filled van without being seat-belted. Karen thought of Freddie Gray, who died \nin the back of an unpadded police wagon.  \n229. At the jail, she was packed into cells, with up to 24 people in her cell. There was \nnot even enough room for everyone to sit down. She was strip searched and exposed to pepper \nspray. Karen noticed that even seventeen-year-old Alexus was strip-searched and required to \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 63 of 85\nsquat and cough. Only once she was in jail did Karen notice that \nher knees were scraped and bleeding. When one of Karenโs non-\nprotester cellmates found out that Karen was a journalist, she went \nback to her bunk and returned with a piece of paper and a pencil. \nโWrite,โ she said. โPlease write about us.โ \n230. Karenโs children were frightened. Karenโs   Figure 37: One of Karenโs bloodied knees. \n \ndaughter Aiesha had been texting with her mother when Karen wa s arrested. She became \n \nworried when her mother stopped responding. โIโm definitely shaken by this,โ Aiesha said. โI \ndonโt know whatโs going to happen now. I donโt know when sheโs going get out. I donโt know \nwhat theyโre going to do to her.โ99 \n231. Karen was released the next day when her photographer, Marco Poggio, posted \nbond for her.  \n232. A neurologist later confirmed that Karen had suffered nerve damage in her left \nwrist and left hand. \n233. In reporting on the event, she said that the protest that day โmade me wonder what \nhappens in Baton Rouge when the world isnโt watching.โ100 \n \n99 Daryl Khan, JJIE Reporter Arrested in Baton Rouge While Covering Protest.

Cherri is a journalist and activist from Rayne, Louisiana. On July \n10, 2016, she missed the youth-led march to the state capitol because she was stuck in traffic. \nShe was there to report for the \nBridge the Gulf Project. She joined \nthe protesters when they had been \ndiverted off of Government Street. \nWhen police arrived in riot gear, \nCherri joined the protesters standing \nin Ms. Batisteโs yard because โthat's \nwhere people would need the most \nFigure 38: Cherri is told to โget back bitchโ by the purple-shirted officer \nwho had pointed a gun at protesters and reporters the night \ndocumentation.\"โ Cherri was in that  before.

The officer was later \nidentified as Cpl. Mancuso. \n235. At the order of a male officer, two male officers pushed Cherri to the ground and \npainfully ziptied her hands together. Cherri dropped her phone and an officer took it. The \nofficers who were ziptying her said \"that phone is gone now!\"  \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 65 of 85\n236. Once Cherri was ziptied, Cpl. \nMancuso came towards her. She told the two \nofficers that she \"want[ed] this one,\" meaning \nCherri. Cherri thought the woman wanted revenge \nfor Cherri photographing her earlier. Cherri says \nโ[t]hat's when I knew I was in trouble.โ Cpl. \nMancuso grabbed Cherri and pulled her backwards \nthrough the street. Cherri told her, \"I can't walk \nbackwards as fast as you can walk forwards.\" She \nFigure 39: Defendants pull Cherriโs (white shirt) ziptied-\nresponded, \"you are going to have to,\" and sped up.  arms up painfully as an officer hands her off to \nthe purple-shirted officer. A witness cries: \nโThatโs a journalist!   \nTwice Cherri fell and the officer kept walking, \n(Video by Kelly Orians at 3:29.) \n \ndragging Cherri until she could get her feet back under her. Cherri told her that she was with the \n \n \npress and had a press pass in her car. Cpl. Mancuso told Cherri that she was not the press and to \n\"shut the fuck up.\"  \n237. As Cherri is walked to the van, a witness cries โThatโs a journalist! That is a \njournalist! Youโre arresting journalists!โ101 \n238. When Cherri said that the zipties were too tight and hurt her, Cpl. Mancuso said \nโa person can go six hours without circulation to their handsโ and tightened them even more. \n239. As they were loading Cherri into the police van, an officer returned her phone. \nCherri told him, โI want you to know I donโt hate you.โ She later described it as a โvery human \nmoment.โ \n240. Cherri had to spend a night in a cold jail cell with no blanket, and was strip-\nsearched twice. Pepper spray was used on her when some protesters sang civil rights songs in \n \n101 Video by Kelly Orians at 3:14.

In July 2016, Daniel was a obtaining his Doctorate of \nMusical Arts at LSU.  \n242. On July 10, Dr. Liebeskind complied with the police orders. When the officers \ntold the protesters to move back to the sidewalks and then back further than the sidewalk, Dr. \nLiebeskind complied. Indeed, he went further than compliance โ he told other protesters to โget \noff the sidewalk, get on the grassโ to encourage their compliance \ntoo.  \n243. When he heard Defendants announce, โThis is no \nlonger a peaceful protest,โ Dr. Liebeskind was standing on the \ngrass by Lisa Batisteโs porch. He could see lines of officers \nmarching as a unit with shields up, and heard from other \nFigure 40: A photo taken by Dr. Liebeskind \nprotesters that they were approaching from the other  moments before his seizure shows that \nhe was standing well back from the \ndirection as well. The officers surrounded him and then  street and sidewalk.   \n \ncharged. Dr. Liebeskind froze and put his hands into the air. All  he knew was that he didnโt want \n \nto antagonize the officers.  He was tackled to the ground by an arresting officer. On the ground, \nDr. Liebeskind said, โI am not resisting. I am not resisting.โ When directed to put his hands \nbehind his back, he tried, telling the officer โIโm trying, sir.โ But he couldnโt because one officer \nwas stepping on his right arm and shoulder, immobilizing it. An officer put a knee into Danielโs \nback and ziptied his hands. An officer then tried to pull Danielโs bicycle helmet off his head with \nbrute force, rather than undoing the clasp. One of the officers kicked Danielโs phone out of his \nhand, where it was permanently lost.  \n244. While waiting to be transported to the jail, Dr. Liebeskind had another protester \nemail his family with a phone. An officer came over and said a statement similar to: โWhat the \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 67 of 85\nHELL do you think youโre doing? Put that damn phone away or else I WILL come over there \nand break your face. Iโm a nice guy but you do NOT want to aggravate me!โ  \n245. Later Daniel shared with his friends that: \nBeing  rushed  by  police  in  riot  gear  may  be  the  scariest  thing  Iโve  ever \nexperienced. That experience โ that fear โ had an enormous influence on my \nthinking while in jail. I knew that I *should* go out again to stand up and speak \nout, but I was afraid. I kept on thinking of the Kent State shootings and [whether \nI] can help without putting my life at risk. . . .  it was the fear of police that had \nme telling myself to stay home and not protest in the future. That fear is very real, \nand for someone like me it is a STRONG deterrent.  \n \n246. Ultimately, Dr. Liebeskind decided to protest again in the future. He said that โI \nwill be back out there non-violently protesting to live in an America where a dead black person \nis NOT presumed guilty until proven innocent.โ As a result of the protest, Dr. Liebeskind had to \nbuy a new phone, new helmet, and new shirt. \n247. Alisha Feldman, Finn Phoenix, and Leah Fishbein. On July 10, 2016, Alisha, \nFinn, and Leah drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to join the youth-led march at the \ncapitol building, and then followed the march back to East Blvd. and France Street. They heard \nthe police say โget out of the streetโ and โthis is no longer a peaceful protest.โ So they got out of \nthe street and stood on the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street.  Then they heard \nthe police order protesters to get off of the sidewalk, so they retreated back to Ms. Batisteโs yard. \nIt was there that they were seized by the police.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 68 of 85\n248. Defendants lifted Finn off the ground \nby their neck, and then put them on the ground with a \nknee in the back. Finn couldnโt breathe. Finn is a \ndiabetic, and their insulin pump fell out of their \npocket.  It took repeated pleas to get an officer to \nreturn the insulin pump to their pocket. At the prison, \nafter a long time a medic took Finnโs blood sugar and \nsaid they were fine. But Finn received no further care \nfor their diabetes, even though they asked several \nFigure 41: Red circle shows Defendants putting \ntimes for a snack to help them regulate blood sugar. A  Plaintiff Finn Phoenix face-down in \nthe street.  \nmedic finally came back and said โwe donโt provide medica l care until you are booked, and you \n \n \nhavenโt been booked yet.โ Finnโs throat was injured so badly that they could not swallow solid \nfood. Finnโs neck and back were so sore that a doctor later diagnosed them with muscle bruising, \nand prescribed a course of muscle relaxers and physical therapy.   \n249. When Leah was seized by Defendants, she told them โIโm not resisting!โ The \nzipties binding her hands were so tight that her hands began to turn purple. At that point, she felt \nlike she was blacking out or disassociating as a result of the pain and fear.  \n250. In the days and weeks subsequent to her arrest, Leah felt very heightened levels of \nanxiety.  She saw a doctor about one week after the arrest for the pelvic injury she sustained, \nduring which her pelvic bone hit the ground so hard when Defendants tackled her that she was \nbruised from mid thigh to mid abdomen. She also saw a podiatrist about a month afterwards for \nfoot pain, because immediately after her arrest she began to suffer from toe and foot pain that \nworsened over time.  Her physical therapist diagnosed her with cervical/lumbar/thoracic spine \ninstability and postural dysfunction, which has resulted in neck pain, hip flexor pain, foot and \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 69 of 85\nback pain. \n251. When Alisha was seized, one Defendant was bending her hands in a way that \ncaused her pain. She cried out, and he bent it harder โ and said โthis wouldnโt happen if you \nwerenโt crying so loud.โ She has been having wrist problems since her arrest.  \n252. Subsequent to their treatment, Finn, Alisha, and Leah attended a group therapy \nsession to relieve their collective trauma/anxiety. \nFigure 42: Original artwork by Alisha Feldman.

Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n259. In Cox v. Louisiana, 379 US 559 (1965) (โCox IIโ) a group of peaceful civil rights \nprotestors were told by the Baton Rouge Police Chief that they must confine their demonstration \nto โto the west side of the street.\" The protesters complied. Law enforcement then ordered them \nto disperse, saying โ\"Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your \ndemonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of \nthe law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be broken up immediately.\" Law \nenforcement then swept in and arrested Rev. Elton Cox. The Supreme Court held that this \nviolated Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights.  \n260. History repeated itself in 2016. A group of peaceful civil rights protesters were \ntold by Baton Rouge law enforcement that they must move their demonstration out of the streets, \nand then off of the sidewalks. Each time, Plaintiffs complied. Defendants then told them to \ndisperse, declaring that it was โno longer a peaceful protest.โ Defendants then swept in and \narrested Plaintiffs.  \n261. Just as Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights were violated by Baton Rouge law \nenforcement in 1961, so too were Plaintiffsโ rights violated in 2016.  \n262. The protests in Baton Rouge are subject to heightened protection for the \nadditional reason that they are peaceful and conducted on public streets and sidewalks. \nโConsistent with the traditionally open character of public streets and sidewalks, [the Supreme \n \n102 Instances of โAll Plaintiffs against All Defendantsโ stated herein does not include Plaintiff Tammy Cheney \nagainst City of Baton Rouge defendants, as those claims have been dismissed. Ms. Cheneyโs claims against all other \nDefendants remain intact. \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 73 of 85\nCourt] ha[s] held that the governmentโs ability to restrict speech in such locations is โvery \nlimited.โโ McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2529 (2014). The government is โsharply \ncircumscribedโ in its authority to restrain expressive activity in โplaces which by long tradition \nor by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate.โ Perry Educ. Assโn v. Perry \nLocal Educatorsโ Assโn, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Public places, such as streets and sidewalks, \nthat are associated with the free exercise of expressive activities โare considered, without more, \nto be โpublic forums.โโ United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983); see also Snyder, 131 S. \nCt. at 1218 (observing that the Supreme Court has โrepeatedly referred to public streets as the \narchetype of a traditional public forumโ); Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, \n469 (2009) (noting โgovernment entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private \nspeechโ in โsuch โtraditional public foraโโ as public streets and parks); Frisby v. Schultz, 487 \nU.S. 474, 481 (1988) (finding that courts need not make any โparticularized inquiry into the \nprecise nature of a specific streetโ because โall public streets are held in the public trust and are \nproperly considered traditional public foraโ).  Any government act to silence speech may not \nโburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governmentโs legitimate \ninterests.โ Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S 781, 798-99 (1989).  \n263. Plaintiffs, and others like them, have since attempted to engage in peaceful protest \non the streets and sidewalks of Baton Rougeโthe very places which the Supreme Court has \ndescribed as having โimmemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and [which], time \nout of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between \ncitizens, and discussing public questions.โ Hague v. Comm. for Indus. Org., 307 U.S. 496, 515 \n(1939).   \n264. In some of Plaintiffโs arrests, the arresting officers explicitly linked the Plaintiffโs \nexpression to the reason why they were being arrested. For example, just before they arrested \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 74 of 85\nher, Defendants told Alexus they had seen her โflicking them off.โ  \nTwo - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Press \n(Plaintiffs Karen Savage and Cherri Foytlin Against All Defendants) \n \n265. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n266. Defendants violated Karen and Cherriโs rights under the First Amendment to \nfreedom of the press by interfering with their ability to gather information and cover a matter of \npublic interest as members of the media. When told that Karen was a member of the press and \noffered credentials, Defendant said โfuck you, journalistโ several times.  \n267. Observing and recording public protests, and the police response to those protests, \nis a legitimate means of gathering information for public dissemination that is protected by the \nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press clauses of the First Amendment, as applied to the \nstates under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendants engaged in \nthese unlawful actions willfully and knowingly, acting with reckless or deliberate indifference to \nPlaintiffsโ First Amendment rights. \n268. This was part of a pattern by Defendants. That weekend Defendants arrested Lee \nStranahan, a conservative journalist from the news site Breitbart, a self-professed critic of Black \nLives Matter critic, and a strong supporter of law enforcement. He reported โI did nothing to \nbreak the law. I was not obstructing traffic because with the road closed and police blocking the \nlane, there was no traffic. At no point did I hear the police give any order for me or anyone else \nto stay back. I was given no warning whatsoever; I was simply approached and forced to stop \nrecording.โ103   \n269. Ryan Kailath, an Indian American reporter for a New Orleans NPR affiliate, was \n \n103 Bill Quigley, Baton Rouge: โPut Those Damn Weapons Down!โ, Huffingtonpost.com, July 12, \n2016, citing Lee Stranahan, My Weekend Incarceration in a Baton Rouge Prison, Breitbart.com, \nJuly 12, 2016. \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 75 of 85\narrested while he was on the grass by the highway across from the police station.  Trying to \nmove away from an interaction with the police, he found himself surrounded by police who did \nnot let people leave.  He was charged with simple obstruction of a roadway despite \nhaving camera footage showing he was never in the road.104  WAFB Assistant News Director \nChris Slaughter was arrested when he put one foot on the highway to get a better angle for a \nvideo shoot.105  \n270. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants unlawful actions, Plaintiffs were \ndamaged. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 43:   A Defendant ordering Plaintiff and Reporter Karen Savage to stop taking pictures of \na group of officers handling a protester.  \n(Photo by Karen Savage.) \n \nThree - First Amendment Retaliation \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n \n104 Id., citing Ryan Kailath & Eve Troeh, WWNO Reporter Describes Arrest While Covering \nBaton Rouge Protests, WWNO, July 11, 2016. \n105 Amy Wold and Maya Lau, Alton Sterling protesters arrested in Baton Rouge to be \nprosecuted? DA Hillar Moore explains..., The Advocate, July 10, 2016. \n \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 76 of 85\n271. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n272. Plaintiffsโ assembly, speech, and newsgathering are protected activities under the \nFirst Amendment. \n273. Defendantsโ arrest, use of force, and searches of Plaintiffs were intended to deter \nand chill their exercise of First Amendment Rights. \n274. For example, it seemed that Nadia and Antonio were targeted because they were \nleading chants.  \n275. As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs were damaged \nand chilled. \nFour - False Arrest and Imprisonment \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n276. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n277. Plaintiffs were arrested without probable cause or due process of law.  \n278. The Affidavits of Probable Cause signed by Defendants were perjured, fabricated, \nboilerplate affidavits that lacked specifics or even basic indicia of truthfulness. Arrest locations \non most were inaccurate by more than five miles.  The arresting officers were not the officers \nwho wrote up the affidavits. \n279. The officers could not have reasonably believed that they had probable cause to \narrest the Plaintiffs for any crime, considering that Plaintiffs had complied with their orders. This \nis especially so considering the United States Supreme Court had issued its rulings in Cox I and \nCox II.  \n280. Furthermore, a necessary element of both 14:97 and 14:100.1 is that the suspect \nactually blocks traffic. This was impossible, as Defendants had blocked off both East Blvd. and \nFrance Street with lines of officers several rows deep. \n \n76 \n \n\nFigure 44:    Three frames from a video taken by Plaintiff Victor Onuoha show lines of police \nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 77 of 85\nofficers blocking off East Blvd. (left and right) and France St. (middle). The \nirregular shapes are due to the fact that the phone was tilted at an angle. \n \n \n281. Furthermore, no Plaintiff actually resisted arrest. But even if they had, one of the \nelements of RS 14:108 (resisting an officer) is that the underlying arrest must be \"lawful.\" Thus, \nif Plaintiffs werenโt lawfully arrested for violation of 14:97 or 14:100.1, then they couldn't have \nbeen guilty of violating 14:108.  See State v. Ceaser, 859 So. 2d 639, 643 (2003) (\"An individual \nin Louisiana has a time-honored right to resist an illegal arrest.\"). \nFive - Violation of Fourth Amendment Rights to be Free from  \nUnlawful Search and Seizure \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n282. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n283. Plaintiffs have a right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. \n284. Defendants violated these rights when they arrested them, detained them, and \nused force on them without probable cause.  \n285. Defendants engaged in these actions willfully and knowingly, acting with \ndeliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n286. Additionally, when Tammy Cheney returned to her car, she found that Defendants \nhad gone through all the belongings in her car, damaged her trunk, and broken off her side \nmirror. This was an illegal search as there was no lawful justification for the search. It was not a \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 78 of 85\nsearch incident to arrest, because Ms. Cheney was not arrested in her car. It was not a search \nincident to impoundment, because the car was not impounded. It was not a search for evidence \nrelevant to the crime, because Tammy was arrested for Obstruction of a Public Passageway and \nResisting Arrest, two crimes that did not involve anything plausibly in a car.  \n287. Plaintiffsโ phones were searched and their property seized unlawfully.  \nSix - Excessive Force \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n288. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n289. The Defendants employed excessive and unreasonable force, or caused excessive \nand unreasonable force to be employed, in effectuating the arrests of Plaintiffs, as specifically \nalleged above, in violation of Plaintiffsโ rights under the Fourth Amendment.  \n290. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \nconstitutional rights. Defendantsโ misconduct was the cause of Plaintiffsโ injuries. \n291. In addition to the actions described above, the use of the acoustic LRAD weapon \non Plaintiffs constituted excessive force. LRAD devices were first developed around 2000, \ninitially for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  In addition to amplifying sound, LRAD devices can possess a high-pitched, volume \nadjustable \"deterrent tone\" that is marketed to law enforcement as useful for crowd control by \ncreating audible discomfort when used at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can \nresult in migraines, sinus pain, dizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as \nwell as tinnitus and hearing loss.106  \n292. For a Model 3300 LRAD, the space within 320 feet of the device is a zone labeled \n \n106 EDREI v. City of New York, 16-cv-1652 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2017) (Denying motion to dismiss \nregarding LRAD use as excessive force.) \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 79 of 85\na \"potential danger area.\"107 Here, Defendants used the LRAD on Plaintiffs at a range of \napproximately 60 to 80 feet.   \n293. The level of sound produced by these devices exceeds both the threshold for \nhuman discomfort (between 85 and 95 dB) and the normal human pain threshold (between 120 \nand 140 dB). \n294. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \nโexposures [greater than] 85 dB may cause hearing loss.โ \n295. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, โany sound over 90 dB can damage a personโs hearing. So the LRAD can threaten the \nhearing of anyone in its path, regardless of whether there is any wrongdoing.โ \nSeven - Failure to Intervene \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants.) \n \n296. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n297. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, \nanguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully \nabove.  \n298. During the events described above, the Defendants stood by without intervening  \nto prevent the violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, even though they had the opportunity and duty to do so.   \n299. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \nconstitutional rights.  \n \n107 Id. \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 80 of 85\n300. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ failure to intervene, Plaintiffs \nsuffered damages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, \nloss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above. \nEight - Civil Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Individual Defendants) \n \n301. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n302. Each of the individual Defendants, acting in concert with one another and other \nyet-unknown co-conspirators, conspired by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose \nby unlawful means.  Each of the individual Defendants took concrete steps to enter into an \nagreement in July 2016 to unlawfully detain, arrest, and imprison the Plaintiffs, knowing they \nlacked probable cause to do so, and for the purpose of impeding Plaintiffs from exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to protest by engaging in non-disruptive speech in support of an issue of \npressing public importance.   \n303. In furtherance of this conspiracy, each of the Defendants committed specific overt \nacts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of unlawfully silencing the Plaintiffs. They \naccomplished this goal by using excessive force to unlawfully effect the Plaintiffsโ arrests, \nfabricating evidence against the Plaintiffs, and approving trumped up charges against them, \nwhich resulted in their unlawful imprisonment.  \n304. In the implementation of the conspiracy, the officers, deputies and troopers of \neach of the law enforcement agencies led by Defendants HOLDEN, DABADIE, \nGEAUTREAUX and EDMONSON employed the customs and policies set forth above.  \n305. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ conspiracy, Plaintiffs suffered  \ndamages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of \nliberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above.  \n306.  Each individual Defendant is therefore liable for the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights \n80 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 81 of 85\nby any other individual Defendant. \nNine - Monell Claim \n(All Plaintiffs Against Policymaker Defendants) \n \n307. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n308. The misconduct described above was caused by the policies, practices, and \ncustoms of Policymaker Defendants. \n309. The above-described widespread practices, which were so well settled as to \nconstitute the de facto policy of the Defendants, were allowed to exist because policymakers \nwith authority over these acts exhibited deliberate indifference to the problem, thereby \neffectively ratifying it.   \n310. This is clear both from the history of Defendant agencies described above, and \nmore specifically from the >100 wrongful arrests of protesters in the two days prior to Plaintiffโs \narrest. See the list of arrestees attached as Exhibit E. \n311. The policies, practices, and customs set forth above were the driving force behind \nthe numerous constitutional violations in this case that directly and proximately caused Plaintiffs \nto suffer the grievous and permanent injuries and damages set forth above. \n312. Defendants named in this Count, acting individually and together, under color of \nlaw, acted to violate Plaintiffsโ rights as set forth in the preceding claims. Policymaker \nDefendants have developed and maintained policies, practices, procedures, customs, and usages \nexhibiting deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens and residents of the \nCity/Parish, including but not limited to those policies, practices, procedures, customs, and \nusages described above, which caused the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights as described herein and \nthe resultant damages suffered. \n313. Policymaker Defendants had the power to prevent or aid in the prevention of the \nwrongs done and conspired to be done as described herein, yet failed or refused to do so, in \n81 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 82 of 85\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n314. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, \nsuffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal \nexpenses, as set forth more fully above. \n315. Moreover, the actions of all Defendants were directed, condoned, and/or ratified \nby Policymaker Defendants. \nTen - Violation of the Louisiana Constitution \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n316. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n317. Defendantsโ actions in arresting, detaining, and using force on Plaintiffs as \ndescribed above interfered with their exercise of fundamental rights to speech, assembly and \npress, as guaranteed by Louisianaโs Constitution. It also interfered with their state constitutional \nrights of privacy, freedom from false arrest and unlawful search and seizure.  \nEleven - Intentional and Negligence State Torts - Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent \nInfliction of Emotional Distress, Assault, Battery, False Imprisonment, Malicious \nProsecution, and Negligence \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n318. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n319. Defendantsโ conduct was extreme and outrageous; knowing that the emotional \ndistress suffered by the Plaintiffs was severe; and Defendants desired or acted with recklessness \nto inflict severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or \nsubstantially certain to result from their conduct. They maliciously commenced criminal \nproceedings against Plaintiffs using perjured and fabricated boilerplate Affidavits of Probable \nCause. They falsely told Tammy Cheney that she would be charged with child endangerment, \nand that her children would be taken away.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 83 of 85\n320. Defendants committed intentional offensive contact with Plaintiffs without right, \nand put the Plaintiffs in apprehension of such contact. \n321. They imprisoned and detained Plaintiffs without probable cause or justification, \nand breached their duty of care with regards to Plaintiffs. \n322. Defendantsโ actions were the cause-in-fact of Plaintiffsโ injuries.  \nTwelve- Vicarious Liability \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Supervisor Defendants) \n \n323. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n324. All supervisor Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs for the negligent and intentional \nacts and omissions of those under their direction and control pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code \narticle 2320 and the doctrine of respondeat superior.   \nThirteen - Indemnity \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Agency Defendants) \n \n325. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n326. Louisiana law provides that public entities are directed to pay any tort judgment \nfor compensatory damages for which employees are liable for actions taken in the discharge of \ntheir duties that are within the scope of their employment activities. \n327. While committing the misconduct alleged in the preceding paragraphs, some \nDefendants were employees, members, and agents of agency Defendants within the scope of \ntheir employment. \n328. Agency Defendants are therefore obligated by Louisiana statute to pay any \njudgment entered against their employees. \nFourteen - State Law Direct Action Claim \n(Against Defendant Insurance Companies) \n \n329. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n330. Defendant Insurance Companies, upon information and belief, have issued and/or \n83 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 84 of 85\ncurrently have in effect one or more policies of insurance covering one or more of the \nDefendants named herein. For valuable consideration received, these policies obligated \nDefendant Insurance Companies, jointly and/or severally, to pay on behalf of their insured \nDefendant(s) any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become obligated to pay to Plaintiffs or to \nindemnify their insured Defendant(s) for any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become \nobligated to pay to Plaintiffs.   \n331. By reason of their illegal and unconstitutional acts, Defendants are liable to \nPlaintiffs for all damages and injuries Plaintiffs has suffered as a result. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant Insurance Companies are contractually obligated to pay these sums on behalf \nof the insured Defendant(s).  \n332. Upon information and belief, Defendant Insurance Companies are liable to \nPlaintiffs for any and all damages incurred by reason of the insured Defendant(s)โ acts, up to \ntheir policy limits, notwithstanding the fact that the insured Defendant(s) may themselves be able \nto assert claims of privilege or immunity from liability.   \n333. Under Louisiana Revised Statute ยง 22:655(B), Plaintiffs bring a direct action \nagainst Defendant Insurance Companies to recover any and all sums they are obligated to pay \nPlaintiffs on behalf of their insureds or to indemnify their insureds. \nVII.    PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request a trial by jury. They request that this Court \nenter the following relief: \nA. Issue a permanent injunction requiring Defendants to end their practices and policies as \ndescribed above, as some Plaintiffs wish to participate in future protests in Baton Rouge;  \nB. Issue a permanent injunction to (1) require Defendants to obtain the expungement of \nPlaintiffsโ arrests at Defendantsโ cost; (2) bar Defendants from reporting Plaintiffโs arrests to any \n84 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 189-1    11/14/19   Page 85 of 85\nlaw enforcement agency, database, employer, or credit agency; (3) end their practices and \npolicies as described above; \nC. Enter a declaratory judgment, specifying Defendantsโ constitutional and statutory \nviolations and declaring the rights of the Plaintiffs; \nD. Award nominal damages;  \nE.

On July 5, 2016, Baton Rouge police officers shot Alton Sterling to death. \n2.  Mr. Sterling was a resident of Baton Rouge and the father of five children. His \ndeath was a tragedy, but not an aberration: in America in 2016, police killed at least one black \nman every forty hours.1  \n3.  In the days following Mr. Sterlingโs homicide, people gathered in Baton Rouge to \nspeak out about the pattern of police misconduct in Baton Rouge and the United States. Some of \nthem were Baton Rouge residents; others came from around Louisiana or other states to support \nthe community and to participate in the demonstrations. Reporters from all over the country and \nworld arrived to document the events. \n4.  On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led protest marched to the State Capitol \nbuilding, where participants spoke, sang, and prayed. Afterwards, the participants marched back \ndown Government Street. Where Government Street hits East Boulevard, law enforcement had \nset up a roadblock. Officers directed the marchers to get off of Government Street. The marchers \ncomplied and turned right onto East Blvd. A block down, the protesters stopped at the \nintersection of East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters gathered there and peacefully \nexercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n5.  Law enforcement officers by the score gathered across from the protesters, \nwielding automatic weapons, body armor and gas masks, and an acoustic weapon mounted on an \narmored vehicle.2 Officers blocked off the streets around the protesters.  \n                                                           \n1 Fatal Force,The Washington Post. 2017. \n2 The acoustic weapon is called an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device). LRADs were first \ndeveloped for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  LRADs are marketed to law enforcement for crowd control by creating discomfort when \nused at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can result in migraines, sinus pain, \ndizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as well as tinnitus and hearing loss.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 3 of 82\n6.  Law enforcement ordered the protesters out of the streets, and most of the \nprotesters โ including Plaintiffs โ complied, stepping back onto the sidewalks.  \n7.  Law enforcement then ordered the protesters off the sidewalks, and most of the \nprotesters โ including Plaintiffs โ complied. They stepped back into the yard of Lisa Batiste, a \nwoman who had given them permission to use her property. \n8.  But law enforcement said โwhere you are standing isnโt good enough.โ They \nordered the protesters to disperse โ an impossible order to comply with, since the police blocked \noff most of the surrounding streets, had already ordered the protesters to stay off the sidewalks, \nand were arresting people who stepped into the streets to leave. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1:    Plaintiff Raae Pollard peacefully protesting (left) and then lifted off the ground by \nher throat by Defendants (right). \n \n9.  Shortly thereafter, the officers swept in en masse, violently grabbing people and \nthrowing to the ground, pinning them, and binding their wrists painfully with plastic zipties. In \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 4 of 82\ntheir frenzy, the officers arrested a mix of protesters, reporters, and legal observers. The \narrestees, including Plaintiffs, were assembled into groups. Other officers wrote Affidavits of \nProbable Cause using pre-fabricated forms, most of which were written with facts from a \ndifferent event entirely. Plaintiffs were charged with โObstructing a Public Passagewayโ or \nโObstruction of a Highwayโ and โResisting Arrest.โ \n10.  Plaintiffs are thirteen protesters and two reporters arrested and jailed during this \npolice frenzy, even though they continuously complied with police orders and had done nothing \nwrong. Many Plaintiffs were injured. One Plaintiff was a 17-year-old girl put in an adult prison \nwith male inmates. One Plaintiff was separated from her children, including a five-year-old who \nwas taken from her and put into child protective services. \n11.  Defendantsโ arrest of peaceful protesters in Baton Rouge is not a new invention. \nIn 1961, the same story happened: Protesters gathered in Baton Rouge to speak out against racial \ninequality and law enforcement misconduct. They marched and then gathered on the sidewalks \nto make their voices heard. Baton Rouge police monitored the protest and then swept in to break \nup the protest. They arrested a man for alleged legal violations including โObstructing a Public \nPassageway.โ  \n12.  The man took his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court told the \nCity of Baton Rouge that its actions had violated the Constitution. It held in Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 U.S. 536, 558 (1965) (โCox Iโ) that it was โclearโ that Baton Rouge law enforcement \ncommitted a โunwarranted abridgment of [the protesterโs] freedom of speech and assembly \nsecured to him by the First Amendment.โ  \n13.  But Defendants did not learn from the Supreme Court's clear and unequivocal \nadmonishment. In 2016, they committed the same constitutional violations, using the same \ntactics, with some of the same criminal allegations. But this time, things are far worse: in 1961, \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 5 of 82\nDefendants arrested a single protester; in 2016, Defendants arrested approximately two hundred \nprotesters, reporters, and legal observers.  \n \nFigure 2: \nAn officer watches protesters in Baton Rouge in 1961.  Officers watch protesters in 2016, shortly before \n(Source: It  Happened in Baton Rouge, U.S.A.) The United  illegally arresting them. The pictured protesters include \nStates Supreme Court decided that the arrest of a Baton  Plaintiffs Blair Imani, Raae Pollard, and Akeem \nRouge prot ester that year was a โclearโ violation of First  Mohammad. \nAmendment rights. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). \n \n \n \n14.  This lawsuit focuses on three connected events that occurred on July 10, 2016. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the arrest of Tammy Cheney and her 17-year-old \ndaughter Alexus Cheney, and their separation from Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son A.J. and \ntheir dog Kelso. The third is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his \nwife Nadia Salazar Sandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. \nDefendantsโ actions that day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred \nafter July 10, 2016.   \n15.  Regarding the massive violation of constitutional rights that occurred on that day, \nBaton Rouge Police Department spokesman Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said that \"[a]nyone who feels \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 6 of 82\nthat something was unjustly done, they need to file a formal complaint.\"3  \n16.  Plaintiffs know โthat something was unjustly done.โ Here, they accept \nMcKneely's invitation \"to file a formal complaint.\"  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1985(3), to vindicate \ntheir rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. Plaintiffs also bring supplemental state-law claims. This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, and 1367. \n18.  This case seeks remedies under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983, \nand 1988. \n19.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 as a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims arose in the Middle District of Louisiana. \nIII.   PARTIES \nA.

Except as otherwise indicated, each \ndefendant is a joint tortfeasor with every other defendant under Louisiana Civil Code Art. 2324. \nIV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA Brief History of Defendantsโ Law Enforcement Misconduct \n61.  Baton Rouge law enforcement has a long history of misconduct and suppression \nof civil liberties. As described above, BRPDโs 1961 suppression of a peaceful protest and arrest \nof Reverend Elton Cox resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court opinion holding that it was โclearโ that \nRev. Coxโs First Amendment rights had been violated. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). \n62.  A year later, tensions between law enforcement and the Baton Rouge community \nescalated after the alleged killings of two Black students by EBRSO deputies at a protest on the \ncampus of Southern University in 1972. \n63.  In 1980, the City of Baton Rouge and several dozen other municipal defendants \nwere placed under a federal consent decree intended to remedy racially discriminatory hiring \npractices of a class of Louisiana police and fire departments, including the BRPD. In the decades \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 15 of 82\nsince, nearly every municipal defendant reached compliance with the consent decree and was \ndismissed from the case โ but not the City of Baton Rouge.  \n64.  In September of 2005, the population of Baton Rouge swelled as many residents \nof New Orleans, a majority Black city, sought refuge from Hurricane Katrina and the resultant \nflood. The Michigan State Police and New Mexico State Police both sent troopers to assist the \nBRPD in policing the cityโs rapidly growing population. \n65.  Within three days of the troopersโ arrival, both state police agencies had ordered \ntheir troopers to cease operations with BRPD after the troopers witnessed and complained of \negregious misconduct and potentially criminal actions by BRPD officers.  One state trooper from \nMichigan said Baton Rouge police attempted to thank him for his help by letting him \"beat \ndown\" a prisoner.5 A spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police told a reporter that โtroopers \nobserved Baton Rouge police officers engage in actions that were an affront to their sense of \ndignity and respect.โ \n66.  Members of both the Michigan State Police and the New Mexico State Police \nshared observations and concerns that were compiled in a formal letter of complaint to the \nBRPD.6 One Trooper reported that โI personally believe that most of the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment are good officers that are being directed by their supervisors to crack down on the \npublic. I donโt know if they have been given any type of direction as to what is right or wrong.โ7 \n67.  As writer Jarvis DeBerry put it: โSo that's what we're dealing with: a police \ndepartment whose behavior worried other law enforcement officials and whose leadership has \nbeen more defensive than responsive to the claims of racist policing.โ8 \n68.  Examples of reported BRPD misconduct included multiple instances of excessive \n                                                           \n5 Jarvis DeBerry, Before killing Alton Sterling, Baton Rouge police had a history of brutality complaints, \nThe Times-Picayune, July 6, 2016. \n6 The report is attached here as Exhibit A.   \n7 Id. at 9.  \n8 DeBerry, supra. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 16 of 82\nforce, including force directed at minors, through the use of tasering, hitting, choking, and \npepper spraying of residents, without warning or threat to the safety of officers or civilians; \nsearches of individuals and their vehicles without reasonable suspicion or probable cause; and \npossibly falsifying information in police reports.   \n69.  The Baton Rouge Police Department, under the direction of Defendant Holden \nand predecessors in office of Defendant Dabadie, also resisted efforts of media and public \ninterest advocates to gain information regarding these post-Katrina abuses, as part of an ongoing \neffort to cover up and conceal officer misconduct, and to promote the police code of silence.   \n70.  In 2006, as part of the effort to cover up and conceal allegations of race-based \nofficer misconduct and to promote the police code of silence, the City/Parish and the BRPD \nactively resisted public records requests and a Public Records Law enforcement action filed by \nThe Advocate newspaper seeking access to the Internal Affairs Division investigative report. \nDefendant Dabadieโs predecessor in office authorized a meritless countersuit to delay and \nthereby shield investigation records from public view, while imposing high costs on the \nnewspaper.  \n71.  Also in 2006, Defendant Mayor Kip Holden denied the NAACPโs suggestion of a \ncivilian oversight board for police.   \n72.  In 2011, then-BRPD Chief Dewayne White publicly stated that ten percent of the \ndepartmentโs officers failed to exercise basic levels of professionalism, and that โitโs become so \ningrainedโ in the minds of some officers that they โbelieve that everybody they come across or \nmost people they come across with that color of skin is probably a criminal.โ Defendant Mayor \nHolden fired Chief White in 2013 and hired Defendant Dabadie in his place. \n73.  In September 2014, a series of racist text messages sent by a BRPD officer to a \ncivilian were published.  In the messages, the officer, a fifteen-year veteran of the department, \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 17 of 82\nreferred both to Black colleagues and civilians with racial epithets, and stated, inter alia, โI wish \nsomeone would pull a Ferguson on them and take them out. I hate looking at those African \nmonkeys at work . . . I enjoy arresting those thugs with their saggy pants.โ \n74.  The officer was placed on administrative leave by BRPD and resigned before any \ndisciplinary action was taken against him by the Department. On information and belief, no \naction was taken by Holden, Dabadie or the City/Parish to determine the extent of similar \nattitudes among other BRPD officers. Defendant Dabadie stated publicly that there was no need \nto do so, because the issue was confined to the lone officer. Defendant Dabadieโs conclusion is \nbelied by more recent stories, including reporting that a White BRPD officer texted his \ncolleagues a picture of a chimpanzee and the phrase โchimp outโ in the context of the Alton \nSterling protests.9  \n75.  BRPD has also had a policy, practice, or custom of excessive use of force. Recent \nallegations include: \n(a) a 2007 arrest on a complaint of โloud musicโ with pepper spray and force that caused \nthe rupture of the arresteeโs bladder;  \n \n(b) a 2008 arrest for smoking marijuana that fractured the skull of the arrestee causing \ninternal bleeding and permanent brain damage;  \n \n(c) a 2011 incident in which an officer instructed a man, who advised the officer he was \nintoxicated, to move a vehicle away from the scene of the arrest; when the drunk driver \ncrashed the car, the officer shot him to death and shot a bystander in the arm;  \n \n(d) a 2014 incident in which BRPD officers strip-searched a visitor to a home which was \nbeing searched by the officers, then kicked the visitor with such force that his head \nslammed into the floor, knocking several teeth out of his mouth;  \n \n(e) a 2015 incident in which two members of the news media were handcuffed, and one \narrested, for taking pictures of an arrest;  \n \n(f) a 2016 incident caught on video in which a sixteen-year-old was held down by multiple \n                                                           \n9 Jim Mustian, Baton Rouge Officer suspended after alleged racial message about Alton Sterling protests, \nThe Advocate, May 22, 2017. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 18 of 82\nofficers while one officer repeatedly punched him in the head;10 and  \n \n(g) the shooting death of Alton Sterling in July 2016.11  \n \n76.  In recent years, suits against the City/Parish for BRPDโs excessive uses of force \nand unconstitutional arrests have resulted in sizeable yearly settlements by the Parish Attorney. \nFor example, the City/Parish paid $372,434 to settle such cases in 2015, $581,286 in 2014, and \n$437,112 in 2011.   \n77.  Similar to BRPD, the East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office has its own history, \nextending decades before the July 2016 protests, of excessive force and unconstitutional arrests.  \nMore recently, allegations of excessive force and unconstitutional arrest leveled against EBRSO \nand Defendant Gautreaux have included multiple instances of excessive force through the \ninappropriate use of tasers, unconstitutional use of mace, and punching and kicking arrestees \nwithout justification.   Some of these allegations are documented in the following cases: Davis v. \nEast Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 08-00708 (M.D. La.) (resolved in private \nsettlement); Martinez v. Gautreaux, Civil Case No. 10-00847 (M.D. La.) (resolved in a private \nsettlement); Plaisance v. East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 16-00365 (M.D. La.) \n(ongoing). \n78.  During Defendant Edmonsonโs tenure, the Louisiana State Police have also \nexhibited excessive force and unconstitutional arrest. While LSP does not typically patrol \nmunicipalities, a pattern of unconstitutional excessive force and illegal arrest has rapidly \nemerged in the brief time that Defendant Edmonson has directed LSP in the provision of policing \nservices in the City of New Orleans.  Suits filed against the LSP since early 2013 allege that \nmembers of LSP, under the direction of Defendant Edmonson, have:  \n(a) physically and verbally abused two Black teenagers without provocation or lawful \n                                                           \n10 DeBerry, supra. \n11 See Andricka Williams v. The City of Baton Rouge, 19th Judicial District Court. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 19 of 82\njustification, desisting only when one of the teenโs mother, a New Orleans Police officer, \narrived and intervened;  \n \n(b) pulled over, shoved to the ground, kicked, and threatened with firearms internationally \nrenowned musician Shamarr Allen while searching for a Black drug dealer โ apparently \nbased solely on Allenโs race;  \n \n(c) manhandled, tased, and verbally and physically assaulted Michael Baugh, a Black \nbarber, causing significant injury, apparently based on his being of the same race as four \nsuspects (Baugh matched no other part of the suspectsโ description). \n \n79.  On information and belief, Defendant EDMONSON chose not to order a thorough \ninvestigation into these practices when they came to light; his inaction condones the falsification \nof information and the intimidation of witnesses to LSP troopersโ unconstitutional conduct. The \nLSP internal investigation into the LSP attack on the teenagers concluded that all of the troopers \ninvolved in the incident had acted appropriately, a conclusion that both the Mayor of New \nOrleans and the Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department publicly criticized based \non publicly available video of the incident. According to news reports, LSP went on to file a \ndisciplinary complaint with the NOPD against the mother of one of the teens for intervening on \nbehalf of her son and his friend. On information and belief, Defendant EDMONSON personally \nwrote a letter to the Superintendent of the NOPD requesting an investigation into the motherโs \nactions. \n80.  Some LSP arrest reports involving officer uses of force show that the LSP \ntroopers write up the arrest report and then later rewrite the report to add allegations of resisting \narrest. \nBRPD Shot and Killed Alton Sterling, the Community Began to Make Its Voice Heard,  \nand Law Enforcement Implemented a Plan to Silence Them \n \n81.   The July 5, 2016 killing of Alton Sterling was documented on video. The video \nshowed Mr. Sterling being forcibly restrained on the ground and then shot. Mr. Sterlingโs death \nprovoked local, national, and international outrage.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 20 of 82\n82.  By the evening of July 6, 2016, Baton Rouge residents gathered for daily and \nnightly vigils and peaceful protests at various locations throughout the city.  Some paid their \nrespects in front of the Triple S Food Mart where Mr. Sterling was killed. Many protested on a \nsizeable grassy lot on Airline Highway, across the street from the headquarters of the BRPD.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3:    Community members gather at the Triple S.  \n83.

In response to the large and growing protests and the national spotlight on \nprotestersโ nonviolent, lawful resistance, Defendants, led by Defendants Holden, Dabadie, \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 21 of 82\nEdmonson, Gautreaux and Cazes, developed and implemented a strategy. Their strategy was to \nsilence this peaceful and lawful exercise of First Amendment rights through intimidation, \nexcessive force, and illegal arrests and detention. Other law enforcement agencies not currently \nknown to Plaintiffs joined Defendants in this endeavor.  \n85.  Between July 8 and 10, 2016, Baton Rouge area law enforcement officers and \ntheir agents โ including BRPD, EBRSO, LSP, deputy sheriffs of surrounding parishes, and \nincluding but not limited to the currently unknown Law Enforcement DOES  - put this plan into \naction. In furtherance of the above objectives, the Defendants unlawfully arrested approximately \n200 protesters as they engaged in peaceful protest protected by \nthe First Amendment.  \n86.  At the same time, Defendants were \ndownplaying their response to protesters. โWe do not want to \nappear to have a military-style response,โ Defendant Dabadie \nsaid during a news conference early on July 9th, 2016. โWeโre \nthere, weโre around, and weโre keeping everything safe, but \nweโve tried to be respectful and reduce our presence at these \nFigure 4: Protester Javier Dunn was beaten so \nevents.โ12 As the arrests of peaceful protesters were \nbadly by Defendants on July 9, 2016 that his eye \nsocket was fractured. A sheriffโs employee told \noccurring, Defendant Col. Mike Edmonson said he thought  him โ'that's what y'all get when you protest.โ1 \n \nhis troopers โdid well.โ13     \n \n87.  But by the evening of Saturday, July 9th, Defenda nts had escalated their actions \n \ntowards the peaceful protesters. Huffington Post senior crime reporter David Lohr stated that \nโone thing I noticed today as opposed to yesterday is that [officers] were certainly more willing \n                                                           \n12 Amy Wold, Bryn Stole, and Maya Lau.

I donโt care if theyโre on the grass or not.โโ15 \n89.  Protester Javier Dunn was arrested by Defendants and beaten so badly that they \nfractured his eye socket โ although his Affidavit of Probable Cause stated that he was arrested \nโwithout incident.โ One of Defendantsโ employees said โ'that's what y'all get when you \nprotest.โ16 \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5:    On July 9, 2016, Defendant Officer Cat points her assault rifle at protesters and a \n \nreporter.

On Sunday, July 10, 2016, the human rights group Amnesty International sent an \nopen letter to the Baton Rouge police department, urging it to use more restraint and respect the \nrule of law in dealing with protesters. โWe would remind you that police authorities are required \nto act in accordance with international human rights standards and the U.S. Constitution,โ the \nletter read. โSpecifically, law enforcement must ensure that any decision to disperse an assembly \nis taken only as a last resort and carefully in line with the principles of necessity and \nproportionality.โ18 But Defendants did not heed Amnesty Internationalโs reminder of their \nconstitutional duties.  \n92.  Three primary incidents occurred that Sunday that give rise to Plaintiffsโ claims. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the separation and arrest of Tammy Cheney and her \n17-year-old daughter Alexus Cheney, and the seizure of Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son. The \nthird is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his wife Nadia Salazar \nSandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. Defendantsโ actions \nthat day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred after July 10, 2016. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n17 Abigail Hauslohner, Robert Samuels & Ashley Cusick, As arrests mount in Baton Rouge, protesters \nquestion police tactics, Wash.

On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led march to the State Capitol was organized. \nParticipants marched from a church to the Capitol, and then gave speeches on the steps of the \nCapitol building.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 6:    Heads are bowed at the prayerful protest on the steps of the state capitol building.  \n94.  Afterwards, the participants marched back down Government Street. When they \nreached the intersection of Government Street and East Boulevard, they had to stop because law \nenforcement had set up a roadblock. The officers directed the marchers to get off of Government \nStreet.  \n95.  At about 5:40 p.m., the marchers complied and turned right onto East Blvd. A \nblock down, the protesters stopped and gathered at East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters \nthere peacefully exercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 25 of 82\n \nFigure 7:    Plaintiffs Raae Pollard, Blair Imani, and Akeem Muhammad make their voices heard at \n \nEast & France.  \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \nFigure 8:    Plaintiff Blair Imani stops to pray.  \n96.

Around 6:00 p.m., legal observers saw police staging at the end of Europe \nStreet.19  Shortly thereafter they saw approximately 40 to 50 police officers form a military-like \nformation on France Street, including an armored vehicle operated by an officer with a rifle.20 \n \nFigure 9:    A still image from a video shows Defendants in tactical gear blocking France Street.

Defendants then gave conflicting instructions, telling protestors both to (1) \ndisperse because their assembly was now unlawful and (2) that people in the street and on \nsidewalks would be arrested.28 (This is conflicting because use of the streets and sidewalks \nwould be necessary to disperse.) On video, Defendants can be heard to order the protesters on \nprivate property that โyou must leave now.โ29 But they also told the protesters: โ[Y]ou cannot \nleave. If you try to step into the street, we will arrest you.โ30 Some protesters who attempted to \nleave the area were chased, tackled, tasered, and arrested.31  \n107. On video, the police can be heard to say: โwe understand you want to protest, but \nthis is not the time or place.โ32 They did not, however, give any indication what the proper time \nor place to protest was, or why this time and place was not permitted.  \n108. Although the character of the protest had not changed,33 law enforcement \nannounced via megaphone: โTHIS IS NO LONGER A PEACEFUL PROTEST.โ34  \n109. One protester, Crystal Williams, described the situation: \nMany protesters froze when the police started arresting folks.

The protesters did not understand how to comply with Defendantsโ conflicting \norders. According to legal observer Lilly Ann Ritter, โI also heard police officers tell people that \nthey needed to disperse several times. However, police were blocking all surrounding \nintersections and there was nowhere for people to go. Protesters who wanted to leave were not \nable to do so.โ38 According to witness Adina Arpadi, โProtesters were not sure what the police \nwanted them to do. It was clear to me that they wanted people to clear the street, but I think some \npeople couldnโt hear the instructions. Also, people were not sure where to go, and orders \nconcerning how long people had to clear the street were conflicting.โ39 According to another \nprotester, the โpolice kept saying that we werenโt allowed to be in the street and we werenโt \nallowed to block public passages, though they did not indicate what โpublic passageโ meant.โ40 \nAs one protester explained, โSome of the police instructions were vague and confusing.

When she heard about the death of Alton Sterling in July 2016, Tammy was \ntraveling through Louisiana with her seventeen-year-old daughter Alexus, her five-year-old son \nA.J., and their dog Kelso. They had been exploring the country, seeing historic landmarks and \nnatural sights, and were on their way back home to North Carolina.  \n134. Partly because of her personal experience, Tammyโs heart went out to the Sterling \nfamily when she heard of Altonโs death. She wanted to stand with them. She also wanted to give \nher children a way to understand what was happening. \n135. So on July 8, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended a peaceful protest in New \nOrleans about the shooting.  It was the first protest any of them had ever been to. Hundreds of \npeople gathered in Lee Circle to make their voices heard. NOPD monitored the situation, but \nallowed the protesters to exercise their First Amendment rights without interference or arrests.55 \n136. The New Orleans protest was so moving that the family decided to attend the \nchildren-led march planned for that Sunday in Baton Rouge.  \n137. On July 10, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended the peaceful protest at the \nstate capitol building in Baton Rouge. Alexus described it later as being โsurrounded by so much \nlove and peace.โ After the protest, they marched back to the church where they had begun, ate \nsome food, and then got back in their car intending to continue their trip to North Carolina.  \n138. They followed the route Google Maps told them to take, but when they got to East \nBlvd. and Government St., the police had blocked off the road. So they pulled into a parking lot \n                                                           \n55 Wilborn P. Nobles III, Hundreds gather at Lee Circle rally.

Alexus decided to go around the corner to videotape what was happening. Tammy \nstayed at the car with A.J., standing on her car and holding up a sign with a political quote on it.  \n140. Alexus joined the protest at East and France. When she \nheard the police tell everyone to get on the sidewalk, she moved to the \nsidewalk. Then she heard the police say if they were on the sidewalk, they \nwould be arrested, so Alexus moved into Ms. Batisteโs yard. Then she \nheard the police order the protest to disperse, so she left and returned to the \ncar and joined her mother.  \n141. Tammy began to see officers with gas masks and shields \ngoing down the road. She told A.J. to get in the car and lock the doors. \nAlexus returned to the car. Tammy told her โAlexus, get in the car and Iโll \nbe right back โ Iโm going to take a couple more pictures and then weโll  Figure 19: Alexus is dragged \naway from the car where she was \nleave.โ She walked a short distance from the car to videotape the scene.  watching her five-year-old brother \nA.J. and her dog Kelso.  \nAccording to a witness, Tammy stepped away from the car for no \nmore than a โminute, minute and a half.โ56  \n142. As soon as Tammy stepped away, three police \nofficers walked up to Alexus. They told her that they had seen her \nโon the front linesโ and that they had seen her flicking them off. \nThey said that Alexus โowed themโ for not arresting her and that \nthey could arrest her if they wanted to. Then they did arrest her.  \n143. As she was being taken away, Alexus screamed  Figure 20: Tammy runs back \nwhen she hears her daughter \nscreaming. \n                                                           \n56 Karen Savage, Family Torn Apart By Police During Baton Rouge Protests, Juvenile Justice \nInformation Exchange, August 2, 2016. \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 39 of 82\nโMOMโ and told the people around her motherโs name. The crowd began to shout โTammy!โ \nand โLet her go! Let her go!โ repeatedly.57 \n144. Tammy ran back to the car. A line of officers \nstopped her and said โNo, you canโt go this way. Go back.โ A \nwoman there was telling the officers, โShe didnโt do anything. \nShe didnโt do anything. They took her . . .  thatโs a minor.โ \nTammy said, โThey took who? They took who? They took my \nkid? My seventeen-year-old?โ She asked the police officer, \nโDid they take my daughter?โ An officer responded, โIf thatโs \nFigure 21: Tammy complies with the \nyour daughter, sheโs going to be there quite a while.โ  \nofficerโs order to stay in place, while \nasking about her daughter. \n145. The woman told the officers, โShe didnโt do \nanything. I was with her.โ Tammy told the officers, โI have a kid in the car. You guys just took \nmy seventeen-year-old away and left my kid in the car.โ The officer said โStay here with me.โ \nTammy complied. Desperate, she said quietly, โYou guys werenโt born this way. You can \nchange, you do know that?โ  \n146. The officers walked her to her car. She told the officers: โYou guys just took my \ndaughter away and she was watching my son.โ The officers said โCalm down, now weโre \nwatching you. Go over there- youโre under arrest too. Weโre gonna take your child.โ  \n147. Doe Defendant Officer Lapeyrouse told her, โYouโre going away for a felony. \nYou abandoned your son.โ Tammy told him, โThis is exactly why weโre here, weโre standing for \njustice.โ He responded, โDo you want me to throw another felony charge at you?โ Officer \nLapeyrouse tried to dispose of her phone in the bushes; another officer put it into Tammyโs bag. \n                                                           \n57 From this point through paragraph 148, the incident was captured on video by a camera in Tammyโs \nhand.

A few minutes later, Tammy and Alexus were seated on a curb together, along \nwith other women waiting to be taken to the prison. With her hands cuffed behind her back, \nTammy tried to console her sobbing daughter.58  \n149. Tammy and Alexus and the other arrested protesters asked the officers to look \ninto the car to make sure A.J. was okay. One of the officers asked Tammy and Alexus, โdid you \nlearn your lessonโ and refused to investigate to see if A.J. was okay until Tammy and Alexus \nsaid โyesโ they had learned their lesson.59  \n150. Tammyโs son A.J. was seized by child protective services.  \n151. Tammyโs dog Kelso was seized by animal control. \n152. Tammy and Alexus were taken to a holding cell, where they were held for \napproximately eight hours. Then they were split up and put into general population of the East \nBaton Rouge Prison. The prison was cold, and they were given no blankets. In Tammyโs cell, the \nwomen huddled together under a mattress for warmth. They were given no toilet paper.  \n153. Despite Alexus being a juvenile, she was held in an adult facility. She was strip-\nsearched and forced to squat and cough. The cell near hers contained adult men.  She was \nexposed to pepper spray, and heard a male inmate being tasered because the male inmates had \nbeen clapping when women were released. She witnessed a woman inmate having her insulin \npump taken away from her.  \n154. While in prison, Tammy was distraught. Based on Doe Defendant Officer \nLapeyrouseโs statements, she thought she was going to be charged with felony child \nabandonment and that her children would be taken from her. She imagined them growing up and \nnot being a part of their lives. Tammy considered committing suicide in her cell.  \n                                                           \n58 Savage, supra. \n59 NRBM, R. Doc. 2-8 at 20.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 41 of 82\n155. Alexus was released at about 5:00 p.m. on July 11. Her mother had not been \nreleased yet, and Alexus was terrified. She was seventeen, abandoned in a strange city, and \nseparated from her mother, her brother, her dog, and their car. She told Defendants โIโm only \nseventeen โ you canโt just put me outside and leave me!โ They said to be quiet and that it wasnโt \ntheir problem. She had to wait seven hours until her mother was released at around midnight.  \n156. Although Tammy and Alexus got out of prison on July 11, they could not get A.J. \nback immediately. Defendants interfered with the process of them getting A.J. back. While \nTammy and Alexus were in the prison, Defendants barred the Child Protective Services worker \nassigned to A.J.โs case from visiting Tammy and Alexus. Defendant Lapeyrous untruthfully told \nthe Child Protective Services worker that A.J. had been โfound locked in his motherโs car at \nGovernment St. and East Blvd. while the parents went to the demonstration. Both parents are \nbeing arrested.โ  \n157. It was not until July 13, 2016 that Tammy got A.J. \nback with the help of a pro bono attorney. On that day, Tammyโs \nattorney showed video of the incident to the Assistant District \nAttorney in family court. Immediately after seeing the video, the \nADA said the case would be thrown out. Within fifteen minutes, \nJudge Pamela Taylor-Johnson ordered the state to immediately \nreturn A.J. to Tammy.60  \n158. A.J., being only five, did not understand what had \nhappened. He had heard on the radio about the killing of Alton \nFigure 22: On July 13, 2016, the \nSterling. And so when he saw police taking his mother and sister \nfamily is finally reunited: Alexus, A.J., \nTammy, and their attorney Adrian \nRoss.  \n \n                                                           \n60 Savage, supra. \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 42 of 82\naway, he thought that the police were going to kill them.61 When Tammy and her son were \nfinally reunited, the first thing she told him was โI told you momma would never leave you, I \nwould always be back to get you if something happened.โ62 Seeing the fear that A.J. had been \nthrough was traumatizing to Tammy and Alexus. \n159. Even their dog Kelso was traumatized. He is now skittish around strangers or loud \nnoises.63 \nThe Take-Down of Antonio and Nadia \n160. On July 10, 2016, Antonio and Nadia drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to \npeacefully protest and show support for other people of color. They participated in the youth-\norganized march to the state capitol building, and then stayed afterwards to help clean up the \narea and provide water and snacks to community members. Then they returned to the office of \nthe Baton Rouge Youth Coalition to reflect on the dayโs events.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 23: Antonio poses at the Capitol protest with two youth leaders. \n \nFigure 23: Plaintiff Antonio Castanon \n                                                           \n(left) at the youth-led protest at the \n61 Id.  \ncapitol building.  \n62 Id. \n \n63 Id. \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 43 of 82\n161. Someone gave Antonio and Nadia a ride back to their car, near the interstate on \nGovernment Street. Because law enforcement had closed several streets in the area, they \nhad to be dropped off several blocks away. As they were walking back to their car, they \nencountered the militarized police unit at the intersection of East Blvd and France Street.  \n162. They watched as the police escalated their activities against the protesters, and \nAntonio and Nadia joined the protesters in retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. They watched as \nofficers in full riot gear charged at the demonstrators, violently throwing them on the ground and \ndragging them away towards militarized vehicles. At this point, Antonio and Nadia feared for \ntheir lives, and rushed away towards safety, exiting Ms. Batisteโs property through the back \ngate.  They made their way to the sidewalk at the corner of Government Street and Maximillian \nSt. Officers there were blocking off Maximillian Street Southbound and then Government Street \nEastbound and Westbound. \n163.  Antonio and Nadia stopped to look for a \nfriend so that they could get in their car and leave. \nWhile waiting for their friend, they led chants. For \nexample, Antonio chanted โyou canโt serve and protect \nwith war weapons.โ Nadia was holding onto the pole of \na stop sign, because she believed that by standing there \nthey were complying with the officersโ orders and were \nsafe from arrest.  \n164. All of a sudden, several officers in riot \ngear tackled Nadia and Antonio to the ground, hard. \nFigure 24: Nadia and Antonio (red circle) holding onto \nthe street sign post as an officer (right) tackles Nadia \nOfficers piled onto them, held them down, and \nfrom behind. The video, from MSNBC, can be \ndownloaded here and is incorporated into this complaint.  \nziptied their hands. During this tackle, the officers \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 44 of 82\nwrenched Antonioโs ankle and knee.  \n165. Bystanders asked the officers why \nAntonio and Nadia were being arrested, since \nthey hadnโt been in the street. It seemed that they \nwere targeted because they had been leading \nchants. Bystanders can be heard on video asking \nโwhat did he do?โ64 \n166. Only after Antonio and Nadia \nwere tackled to the ground can officers be heard \non video ordering bystanders to โclear the \nFigure 25: Five officers tackle Antonio and Nadia to the \nground. \n \nsidewalk.โ65 A witness can be heard to say that \nAntonio โwas just standing there. He was just \nstanding there.โ66 A dozen or more people \ncontinued to stand on the sidewalk right by where \nAntonio and Nadia were standing; none of them \nare arrested.67 A witness says โit was clear, it was \nvery clear. [Antonio] was specifically targeted.โ68  \n167. The zipties were so tight that \nFigure 26: Nadiaโs face is pushed to the ground next to \nan officerโs foot as Defendants ziptie her hands. As the \nNadiaโs hands began to turn purple69 and \nvideo shows, at no point do Nadia or Antonio make any \nmove to resist arrest.  \n \n                                                           \n64 A video taken by a witness and incorporated into this complaint shows the event.

As the officers walked Nadia and Antonio to some large vehicles, Antonio asked \nwhy they were being arrested. An officer responded, โI donโt know.โ70 An officer bent Nadiaโs \narms and said โAlton Sterling was a murderer.โ  \n169. As Nadia and Antonio were separated, Nadia was terrified, but told Antonio, \nโbaby, I love you, Iโm fine.โ But privately she thought that this was perhaps the last time she \nwould see her husband. \n170. As she was being walked away, Nadia heard an officer say โtake her the long \nway.โ She didnโt know what this meant, but it caused her to fear for her life โ and so she began \nyelling her name and birth date to ensure that she was not disappeared. \n171. Antonio heard an officer tell a protester to โshut your mouth, or get your head \nbashed in.โ Antonioโs ankle began to swell so much that his shoe was cutting off blood flow. He \nasked for medical attention but was ignored by the officers.  \n172. They were loaded into vans and transported to the jail, but not seat-belted. \n173. At the jail, an officer asked Antonio for his information to write him up. The \nofficer said that he was really confused and didnโt know how to properly proceed since he wasnโt \nthere for Antonioโs arrest, did not know the place or time of arrest, and didnโt know how the \nsituation unfolded. Antonio pointed out his ankle injury again, but was not treated. \n174. Nadia was strip-searched twice at the prison, and required to remove her bra. A \nwhite woman asked to keep her bra, and the guard said yes. Nadia asked to keep her bra, and the \nguard said no. Nadia was given no blanket in the cold jail cells. She was exposed to mace when \nofficers maced a nearby cell .  \n175. At the prison, law enforcement officers spelled her name differently on different \n                                                           \n70 Id.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 46 of 82\nforms. She recalls the following variations: Madye Salvar, Nadye Salva, Nadia Salvar, and the \ncorrect Nadia Salazar Sandi. \n176. At one point at the prison, a guard came and requested volunteers.  Antonio had \nno idea what would happen next, but stood up and requested medical attention. The guard told \nhim to shut up and get in the volunteer line. Another protester told the guard that Antonio needed \nto get my ankle looked at and the guard replied โyes, I heard him already.โ \n177. According to the sworn statement of protester Julien Bond, โI noticed at this time \nthat one other arrestee โ Antonio โ requested medical care because his ankle was swollen from \nbeing dragged but his request was ignored.โ71 \n178. At approximately midnight, Antonio was taken to the doctorโs station. He told \nnurses what happened to his ankle, and they gave him a leaky bag of ice. A doctor swung by but \nsaid he couldnโt help because he didnโt have the time. Antonio was given some anti-\ninflammatories. The doctor came by again later, looked at the ankle, and said โthis is not good.โ \nAfter the ice melted, Antonio was made to sign a medical form and was taken back to the area \nwith the holding cell.    \n179. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country with a history of violence and \ninjustice. But she says that โeven with all the oppression in Bolivia, I donโt remember anything \nlike what I experienced in Baton Rouge.โ  \nPlaintiffs Were Arrested with Perjurious Affidavits of Probable Cause  \nThat are Facially False and Contradictory  \n \n180. After being seized by Defendants, Plaintiffs were assembled into groups with \nother arrestees.  Other officers โ not the ones that had grabbed them โ wrote Plaintiffs up using \npre-printed affidavits. Each Plaintiff was written up for two crimes โ โResisting Arrestโ (R.S. \n14:108) and either โObstruction of a Highwayโ (R.S. 14:97) or โObstruction of a Public \n                                                           \n71 NRBM v. BR, R. Doc. 2-4 at 7. \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 47 of 82\nPassagewayโ (R.S. 14:100.1).72  \n181. The primary difference between the two obstruction statutes is that 14:100.1 \ncriminalizes blocking roads and sidewalks, while 14:97 only applies to roads. There is no \ncorrelation, however, between where the Plaintiff was standing when arrested and which crime \nthey were charged with. \n182. According to The Advocate, for โ132 of the 176 incident reports of protesters \nprovided by the Baton Rouge Police Department, police used one of two versions of boilerplate \nlanguage.โ73 This was a red flag for LSU law professor Scott Sullivan, who reviewed the \naffidavits obtained by The Advocate:  \nProbable cause requires not just the sense that a defendant may have committed a \ncrime, but that this particular defendant at a particular time and place committed a \nparticular crime  . . .What seems to be missing is a careful consideration of this \nparticular defendant's actions . . . That sense [that a crime was committed]  is \nundermined when you just see a repeated narrative over and over again without \nmuch deviation.74 \n \n183. Thirteen of Plaintiffsโ affidavits of arrest have been obtained from the Clerk of \nCourt. (The clerk has no affidavit for Plaintiffs Victor Onuoha and Nadia Salazar Sandi.) The \naffidavits are facially false and contradictory for reasons including the following: \na. False Location. The affidavits were pre-written with facts that described an incorrect \nlocation. Eleven of the thirteen affidavits say that the protests were โin the vicinity of \nBaton Rouge Police Departmentโs Headquarters at 9000 Airline Highway.โ Plaintiffs \nwere actually arrested nearly six miles away, in the vicinity of East Blvd. and France St. \n \nFigure 27:   Excerpt from Affidavit of Raae Pollard.  \n                                                           \n72 See Exhibit C to this Complaint. \n73 Maya Lau, Identical arrest reports for many Alton Sterling protesters a red flag, legal experts say. The \nAdvocate. Sept. 18, 2016.  \n74 Id. \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 48 of 82\n \nFigure 28:   Map of distance โ 5.8 miles โ from location identified in Affidavit \nto actual location of arrest.  \n \nb. No Parking Lots. All thirteen affidavits say โProtesters assembled at provided parking \nareas and in surrounding parking lots.โ There is no parking lot at East and France. \n \nc. Wrong Address for BRPD HQ. Four of the affidavits have โ9000 Airline Highwayโ \ncrossed out and replaced with โ500 East Blvd.โ This renders these affidavits even more \ncontradictory, because the affidavits then read โin the vicinity of Baton Rouge Police \nDepartmentโs Headquarters located at 500 East Blvd.โ โ which is not the BRPD \nHeadquartersโ location.  \n   \nFigure 29: Excerpt from Affidavit for Blair Imani, showing address \n  crossed out. The resulting affidavit is false โ BRPDโs headquarters is \nnot at 500 East Blvd. \n \nd. Felonious Misdemeanors? Each of the affidavits says the โDefendant did knowingly \nand feloniouslyโ violate R.S. 14:97 or 14:100.1. Both those statutes, however, describe \nmisdemeanors. \n \ne. False Description of Plaintiffโs Conduct. Each of the affidavits says: โDuring the \nprotest, the Defendant entered the roadway and was provided another verbal order to \nexit the lanes of travel. Moments later the Defendant entered the roadway again and was \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 49 of 82\ntaken into custody by Officers on the scene.โ This is not a true description of the seizure \nof any Plaintiff.  \n \nf.  Contradictory Statutes. Two of the affidavits are contradictory as to what crime is \nbeing alleged. In the synopsis, they say the Plaintiff violated โLRS 14:97,โ but \nelsewhere 14:97 is crossed out and replaced with 14:100.1. \n   \nFigure 30:   For two of the Affidavits, the officer was inconsistent \nabout what crime was being alleged.  \n \n \ng. False Statements About Miranda Rights. Each affidavit says the defendant was \nโverbally advised of their rights per the Miranda ruling.โ This is false โ Plaintiffs were \nnot all read their Miranda rights. Some Plaintiffs even asked to be read their rights, but \nwere refused.  \n \nh. One Consistent Truth: Affidavits Say The Protests Were Peaceful. One thing is true \nabout every affidavit: every single one of them describes the protests as โpeaceful.โ   \n            Figure 31: Excerpt from Affidavit for Raae Pollard \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 50 of 82\nThe Aftermath \n184. Defendantsโ illegal plan to silence the communityโs voice was disturbingly \nsuccessful. There were no more major protests following the dozens of seizures, beatings, and \narrests of protesters on Sunday, July 10. Defendantsโ efforts had the actual effect of chilling the \ncommunityโs exercise of its First Amendment rights.  This is clear from contemporaneous \nstatements by protesters:  \na.  โSince the protest, I have not been able to shake a feeling of fear and \nsadness. To be immediately in front of a police force that wields so much \npower and to know that they do not respect the law, makes it feel impossible \nto protest.โ75  \n \nb.  โI am too afraid to return to Baton Rouge. I was so scared the entire time. \nWe didnโt come to get arrested. We didnโt come to get killed. We just came \nto protest and to get justice for Eric. They treated us so badly.โ76 \n \nc.  โAfter all this, I am now aware of the incredibly high risk of protesting. I \nwas definitely afraid.โ77  \n \nd.   โI had planned to protest in upcoming marches, though will likely not do so \nin the future. I have been dissuaded by the reports of arrested \nprotestorsโฆโ78  \n \n185. Even the trained Legal Observersโ activities were chilled: โBecause of the actions \nof the police I was very afraid someone would get shot or \nthat they would tear gas us. The police were arresting \nLegal Observers as well as civilians. It is frightening to \nthink about Legal Observing in the aftermath of what I \nwitnessed.โ79 Sister McCrary reported that โI am terrified \nto try to negotiate with the police again in Baton Rouge. I \n                                                           \n75Aff. of Caressa Chester, NRBM, R. Doc. 2-5 at 4. \n76 Aff. of Sandra Harris, NRBM, R.

I do not feel comfortable training Legal \nObservers and placing them in harmโs way in Baton Rouge.โ80  \n186. Shortly after the protests, the United Nations Special Rapporteur On The Rights \nTo Freedom Of Peaceful Assembly And Of Association made a visit to Baton Rouge. On July \n27, 2016, he spoke out against the law enforcement practices in Baton Rouge: โIt is manifestly \nunwise to respond to a largely peaceful, grieving crowd with riot gear, random arrests, flimsy \ncharges, rough physical handling, verbal insults and so forth. This is not only a violation of the \nright to peaceful assembly, it also dangerous for participants, the general public and police \nofficers. \n187. By July 31, 2016, the East Baton Rouge District \nAttorney had posted an ACLU guide entitled โKnow Your \nRights:  Demonstrations and Protestsโ to the District \nAttorneyโs website.81 The guide emphasized that โGenerally, \nall types of expression are constitutionally protected in \ntraditional โpublic forumsโ such as streets, sidewalks and \nFigure 33: The District Attorney posts on \nparks.โ It added that โthe First Amendment prohibits [advance  his website the ACLU guide to peaceful \nprotesting, which says โIf marchers stay on \nthe sidewalks and obey traffic and pedestrian \nnotice permit requirements] from being used to prevent rallies \nsignals, their activity is constitutionally \nprotected even without a permit.โ \nor demonstrations that are rapid responses to unforeseeable \n \nand recent events.โ The guide explained: \nIf organizers have not obtained a permit, where can a march take place?  \nIf marchers stay on the sidewalks and obey traffic and pedestrian signals, their \nactivity is constitutionally protected even without a permit. \n \n188. A government spokesperson even admitted that protesters had been targeted for \narrest based on their speech: โI think the law enforcement folks have a strategy of identifying \n                                                           \n80 Aff. of Alison McCrary, NRBM, R.

Despite the widespread consensus that there was a problem with law \nenforcementโs handling of the protesters, Defendant Louisiana State Police Col. Mike Edmonson \ndenied that his troopers had done anything wrong. He said that they โused incredible restraintโ in \ntheir response to protesters83 and said โI was certainly pleased with what I saw here.โ84  \n190. But Lt. General Russel L. Honore, the retired U.S. Army leader who coordinated \nmilitary response efforts after Hurricane Katrina, felt differently. After reviewing hours of \nvideos, imagery and other coverage of protests in Baton Rouge, he said:  \nThe gas masks themselves were pretty intimidating . . . My concern is, with those homes \nthere and all the people in the houses, that would not have been a good place to do (show \nthat weaponry), particularly when the protesters werenโt being violent.  . . . Something is \nnot right in that department in terms of amount of equipment and amount of training.85 \n \n191. A year after the protests, Defendant Dabadie acknowledged problems with the \nJuly 2016 handling of protests. He said โWe were not perfect in the first round of the protests, \nand we had some things that we needed to correct.โ86 But Defendants have said they will respond \nto future protests in much same way,87 albeit with some โtacticalโ changes.88   \n192. Shortly after the July 10 protests, a tragedy occurred.  Three Baton Rouge law \nenforcement officers โ Brad Garafola, Montrell Jackson and Matthew Gerald โ were killed by a \n                                                           \n82 Maya Lau, Helping or hurting?

Blair explained that โWe were trying to quell antagonism โ instead of shouting โF \nthe Police,โ we were trying to get people to shout Alton Sterlingโs name.โ91 They worked \ntogether to help other protesters comply with the police orders to clear the streets.

Sister Alison McCrary witnessed \na โgroup of officers tackle [Blair], pull off her hijab \nhead scarf, and arrest her.โ92 Blair and Akeem were \ntrampled by officers as they lay on the ground. \n196. Defendants knelt on Akeemโs neck and \nback to hold him down, even though he was compliant \nFigure 35: Yellow circles show Akeem and Blair \nunderneath Defendants. \nwith his fingers splayed open.93 \n  \n \n197. Blair heard an officer shout โReally give it to her,โ so she became terrified that \n \n \nshe was going to be beaten out of view of the cameras and other observers. โI started screaming, \nand that was because I was fearing for my life,โ she said. The zip ties on her hands were so tight \nthat her hands turned purple.  \n198. Blair has had to seek the services of a trauma therapist after these events. Akeem \nhas experienced recurring neck problems.  \n199. Less than a week after her arrest, Blair helped organize a vigil with the Louisiana \nState University Student Body Association in response to murder of three Baton Rouge police \nofficers. Representative John Lewis spoke of Blairโs actions on TV, and drew a direct \ncomparison between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and what Blair and other young \npeople are doing in the present. \n200. Raae Pollard and Sami Nichols. Raae and Sami came from New Orleans to \nBaton Rouge for the protest. The two of them complied with police orders to clear the streets and \nsidewalks. Raae was especially concerned about following their orders, because she is a green \ncard holder from Australia.  \n                                                           \n92 NRBM, R.

When Raae was on the yard, police said โwhere youโre standing is not good \nenough.โ But Raae didnโt understand what she was supposed to do โ she was on private property \nand surrounded by police.  She waited to get more specific directions from the officers. Raae and \nSami were standing on Ms. Batisteโs lawn when they were grabbed by Defendants. When she \nwas grabbed, Raae let her body go limp, like a ragdoll, to put up no resistance to the officers. \nRaae turned and saw Samiโs head smashed into the road.  A witness wrote that she โsaw Raae \nthrown to the ground, then Sami smashed on to pavement, tackled with the force of a \nlinebacker.โ \n202. Raae saw a female officer in a purple shirt and bulletproof vest (later identified as \nCpl. Alaina Mancuso) push Samiโs face into the concrete and say โtrashy bitch . . . go back to \nCalifornia.โ  \n203. Another witness, Jessica Pinkham, \nwitnessed the officer stomp on Samiโs head. She wrote: \nโ[Sami] sustained a concussion due to a female police \nofficer, who had brandished her assault rifle at peaceful \nprotestors, stomping on her face on the ground.โ She \nsaid that the officer she saw was wearing a purple shirt \nand had a photo in The Advocate on July 11, 2016.  \n204. The officers who seized Raae and Sami \ndid not write them up. The officers had forgotten who \ngrabbed who, and so they split up the arrestees at  Figure 36: Sami being arrested Cpl. Mancuso, \nwho stomped on Samiโs head and said \nrandom. Raaeโs zip ties were so tight that she almost  โtrashy bitch . . . go back to \nCalifornia.โ \n \nfainted. They had to be removed by officers.  \n \n \n205. As a result of Defendantsโ violence Sami suffered a head injury, and was passing \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 56 of 82\nin and out of consciousness. Once they were detained at the prison, a witness said that \nโsometime around 10:30 pm, a medic in blue scrubs came by, poked him head into the cell, and \nsaid โeveryoneโs fine.โโ Blair Imani, who had EMT training, was concerned that Sami might \nhave a concussion. When the medic returned she asked him to look at Sami and do a state of \nconsciousness test. Blair specifically told the medic that she thought Sami might have a \nconcussion. The medic said โโIโm not the hospitalโ and walked away.โ94  \n206. The day after they were released, Sami and Raae went to University Medical \nCenterโs emergency room. They gave Sami pain medicine and muscle relaxers. Raaeโs father in \nAustralia had a panic attack when he saw the news, which terrified Raae.  \n \n207. Tammy Cheney. Tammy was mistreated by Defendants as described above. \n208.  Two days after her arrest, Tammy said โThis experience scared the daylights out \nof me, and I will never go to a protest again.โ95 She has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Complex and Major Depressive, Recurrent, Severe Without Psychosis. She has \nbeen prescribed bi-weekly individual therapy. As of November 2016, her licensed clinical social \nworker assessed that she could not work at all โdue to the severity of emotional and cognitive \nimpairments.โ The social worker estimated that the impact of the condition on Tammyโs ability \nto work would be expect to last โ[m]ore than 12 months.โ \n209. On October 9, 2016, Tammy shared the following description of her feelings with \nher friends: \nEvery day is a mental struggle. I convince myself daily that im ok and am \nreleaved at the end of the day i made it. I cant watch anything that reminds \nme of that time, without feel the devastation that i went through all that \ncrap. I dont trust anyone. Walking in fear constantly, got robbed for 350$ \nthe  other  day  trying  to  move  into  new  place  and  it  was  a  scam  on \n                                                           \n94 Aff. of Marina Sparagana, NRBM, R.

Sorry to through all this on you. \nBut it is all i have on my mind \n \n \n210. Alexus Cheney. Alexus was mistreated by Defendants as described above. \nAlexus, though only seventeen, was housed in an adult prison with both male and female \ninmates. She was required to take off all her clothes, squat and cough, during a strip-search. \n211. As a result of everything that happened to her, Alexus has struggled with post-\ntraumatic stress. She has suffered from depression and anxiety, and says that she has โlost a lot \nof competence.โ She has been asking herself, \"What is wrong with us? What did we do to \ndeserve this?\" As a result of these impacts, she dropped out of school. She tried to get a GED but \ncouldnโt. The incident has affected her relationship with her mother.  \n212. Victor Onuoha. Victor was a thirteen-year resident of Baton Rouge, and had just \nmoved to Gretna before Alton Sterling was shot. On July 10, Victor drove with his girlfriend to \nbe a part of the march to the capitol. Afterwards, they parked and then joined the protest at the \npoint when people were retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. He was standing in Ms. Batisteโs yard \nwhen he was arrested by Defendants.   \n213. Antonio Castanon Luna and Nadia Salazar Sandi. Antonio and Nadiaโs arrests \nhave caused lasting problems for them. Due to her trauma of being in a cold jail cell, Nadia now \nbecomes afraid when she gets cold, and shakes at night. Nadia has had trouble sleeping and has \nhad nightmares. Because her arrest was televised, it causes Nadia a great deal of stress to know \nthat the cousin she raised saw her getting arrested. \n214. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country that has historically used police force \nto stop peaceful protesters. She did not expect to experience the same thing in โthe land of the \nfree.โ As a result, she has found herself more cautious about speaking out about things after her \narrest, even on social media. She says โI feel like my first amendment right was stripped from \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 58 of 82\nme from that day on.โ \n215. Antonio has had lasting problems with his knee and ankle, and has had to seek \nmedical treatment repeatedly. He has felt anxiety, especially when reflecting on his arrest or \nwhen participating in public demonstrations. \n216. Due to the traumatic events of July 10 and 11, Antonio and Nadia decided to \nmove back to Maryland to be closer to family. This was expensive and difficult as they had been \nbuilding a life in New Orleans.  \n217. Despite the way they were treated in Baton Rouge, Antonio and Nadia returned to \nhelp the communities afflicted by the August 2016 floods. They helped prepare flood-damaged \nhomes for rebuilding. They passed out clothes and other essential items.  \n218. Karen Savage. Karen Savage is a reporter with the Juvenile Justice Information \nExchange (โJJIEโ). In July 2016, Karen and her photographer Marco Poggio were on assignment \nfor JJIE, covering youth reactions to the killing of Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police officers \nBlane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.96  She had a press pass from the CUNY Graduate School of \nJournalism.  \n219. On July 9, she and her team reported from the Triple S market where Mr. Sterling \nhad been killed. That evening, she observed the protest at Airline Highway. She observed a \nshort, white female officer with an assault rifle. She observed that the female officer โhad it up \nand was aiming it at the protesters and waving it back and forth.โ \n220. On July 10, while Marco edited video, Karen spent the morning and early \nafternoon emailing back and forth with a police communications person. They missed the capitol \nprotest due to traffic, and arrived to observe the protestors once they had assembled at East Blvd. \nand France Street. She saw officers wearing combat gear with a tank-like vehicle. Despite having \n                                                           \n96 Karen Savage, Reporter Recounts Arrest, Prison Stay After Baton Rouge Protest. Juvenile Justice \nInformation Exchange, July 22, 2016. \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 59 of 82\nreported on and attended dozens of protests, Karen had never seen a police response anywhere \nclose in kind to what she saw in Baton Rouge. She wrote: \nIโd been to protests in New York, Boston and elsewhere and have encountered \nheavily armed police. Iโd seen armored vehicles and heard LRADs before. But \nnever before had I witnessed officers risking the safety of so many, including \nthemselves โ not on the Mass Turnpike in Boston, not in Times Square and not \nmore recently on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where I had covered anti-police \nbrutality protests before being sent down to Louisiana. In Baton Rouge, it seem as \nif the police came ready for war.97 \n \n221. She watched the protesters mostly comply with police orders to clear the streets \nand sidewalks. Once the police ordered the protesters to disperse and started making arrests, \nKaren moved away towards the McDonalds a few blocks away, taking pictures as she went.98 \n222. She was walking towards the door of the McDonaldโs when an officer grabbed \nher from behind and shoved her to the ground. โAre you resisting?โ he asked. โI'm a journalist, \nmy credentials are in my right pocket, you can take them out,โ Karen said, using the calmest \nvoice she could muster. She feared to put her hands into her pockets herself.  โFuck you, \njournalist,โ he shouted from behind Karenโs ear. โYou donโt listen.โ  Eventually, Karen stopped \nsaying she was a journalist because this seemed to make the officer angrier.  \n223. The officers ziptied her hands together โ so tight that her hands hurt, then went \nnumb, and then began to change color. โCould you loosen it a little? Please,โ Karen asked. \nโWhich one hurts?โ he replied. She nodded silently toward her left hand, then puffy and bluish \nred. He grabbed the plastic cuff on her right hand, grunted, and pulled it tighter. \n224. Another officer showed her a large serrated knife and jokingly offered to use it on \nher. Karen heard someone yell her name and she turned to see a friend up the block. She tried to \nshout her editor's email address to the friend, but the pain made it hard to remember. โShut up, or \nwe'll arrest her, too,\" said the officer with the knife. The officer who first grabbed her said again, \n                                                           \n97 Id. \n98 NRBM, R. Doc. 2-8.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 60 of 82\nโFuck you, journalist.โ \n225. Karen was handed off to another officer. The pain in her hands had become so \nintense that Karen began to get dizzy. Another officer said \"What the hell did they do to you?\" \nand got an officer to bring clippers to cut the zipties. The officer told her she had to hold still and \nthen rammed the tool under the plastic tie. The edges of Karenโs vision grew dim and she could \nhear herself scream. Finally, the left cuff popped off, then the right. Karen could breath again. \nThe officer quickly pulled back Karenโs hands and put on more ties. They were still painful, but \nnot excruciating like the last pair. \n226. While waiting for police transport, Karen met Tammy and Alexus. Tammy said \npolice told her she would be charged with abandonment of her son, who would be turned over to \nLouisianaโs Department of Social Services. Karen turned her head to hide the tears she felt \nrolling down her face. \n227. As she talked, Karen noticed the curb felt oddly smooth and cold in the heat. Then \nshe realized she wasnโt feeling the curb at all โ her hand had gone numb. \n228. Karen and thirteen other people were transported to East Baton Rouge Police \nParish in an over-filled van without being seat-belted. Karen thought of Freddie Gray, who died \nin the back of an unpadded police wagon.  \n229. At the jail, she was packed into cells, with up to 24 \npeople in her cell. There was not even enough room for everyone \nto sit down. She was strip searched and exposed to pepper spray. \nKaren noticed that even seventeen-year-old Alexus was strip-\nsearched and required to squat and cough. Only once she was in \n Figure 37: One of Karenโs bloodied knees. \n \njail did Karen notice that her knees were scraped and bleeding.   \n \nWhen one of Karenโs non-protester cellmates found out that Karen was a journalist, she went \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 61 of 82\nback to her bunk and returned with a piece of paper and a pencil. โWrite,โ she said. โPlease write \nabout us.โ \n230. Karenโs children were frightened. Karenโs daughter Aiesha had been texting with \nher mother when Karen was arrested. She became worried when her mother stopped responding. \nโIโm definitely shaken by this,โ Aiesha said. โI donโt know whatโs going to happen now. I donโt \nknow when sheโs going get out. I donโt know what theyโre going to do to her.โ99 \n231. Karen was released the next day when her photographer, Marco Poggio, posted \nbond for her.  \n232. A neurologist later confirmed that Karen had suffered nerve damage in her left \nwrist and left hand. \n233. In reporting on the event, she said that the protest that day โmade me wonder what \nhappens in Baton Rouge when the world isnโt watching.โ100 \n234. Cherri Foytlin. Cherri is a journalist and activist from Rayne, Louisiana. On July \n10, 2016, she missed the youth-led march to the state capitol because she was stuck in traffic. \nShe was there to report for the \nBridge the Gulf Project. She joined \nthe protesters when they had been \ndiverted off of Government Street. \nWhen police arrived in riot gear, \nCherri joined the protesters standing \nin Ms. Batisteโs yard because โthat's \nFigure 38: Cherri is told to โget back bitchโ by the purple-shirted officer \nwho had pointed a gun at protesters and reporters the night \n                                                            before.

Cherri stepped back to \navoid getting in the way of the arrest, and she heard someone say heard someone say, โCat, grab \nher.โ Cherri was then pushed by a female officer wearing a purple shirt who said โget back, \nbitch.โ Cherri recognized her from video as the officer who had been pointing her assault rifle at \nprotesters and reporters the night before. The officer was later identified as Cpl. Mancuso. \n235. At the order of a male officer, two male officers pushed Cherri to the ground and \npainfully ziptied her hands together. Cherri dropped her phone and an officer took it. The \nofficers who were ziptying her said \"that phone is gone now!\"  \n236. Once Cherri was ziptied, Cpl. \nMancuso came towards her. She told the two \nofficers that she \"want[ed] this one,\" meaning \nCherri. Cherri thought the woman wanted revenge \nfor Cherri photographing her earlier. Cherri says \nโ[t]hat's when I knew I was in trouble.โ Cpl. \nMancuso grabbed Cherri and pulled her backwards \nthrough the street. Cherri told her, \"I can't walk \nbackwards as fast as you can walk forwards.\" She \nFigure 39: Defendants pull Cherriโs (white shirt) ziptied-\narms up painfully as an officer hands her off to \nresponded, \"you are going to have to,\" and sped up. \nthe purple-shirted officer. A witness cries: \nโThatโs a journalist!   \nTwice Cherri fell and the officer kept walking, \n(Video by Kelly Orians at 3:29.) \n \ndragging Cherri until she could get her feet back under her. Cherri told her that she was with the \n \n \npress and had a press pass in her car. Cpl. Mancuso told Cherri that she was not the press and to \n\"shut the fuck up.\"  \n237. As Cherri is walked to the van, a witness cries โThatโs a journalist! That is a \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 63 of 82\njournalist! Youโre arresting journalists!โ101 \n238. When Cherri said that the zipties were too tight and hurt her, Cpl. Mancuso said \nโa person can go six hours without circulation to their handsโ and tightened them even more. \n239. As they were loading Cherri into the police van, an officer returned her phone. \nCherri told him, โI want you to know I donโt hate you.โ She later described it as a โvery human \nmoment.โ \n240. Cherri had to spend a night in a cold jail cell with no blanket, and was strip-\nsearched twice. Pepper spray was used on her when some protesters sang civil rights songs in \njail.  \n241. Dr. Daniel Liebeskind. In July 2016, Daniel was a obtaining his Doctorate of \nMusical Arts at LSU.  \n242. On July 10, Dr. Liebeskind complied with the police orders. When the officers \ntold the protesters to move back to the sidewalks and then back further than the sidewalk, Dr. \nLiebeskind complied. Indeed, he went further than compliance โ he told other protesters to โget \noff the sidewalk, get on the grassโ to encourage their compliance \ntoo.  \n243. When he heard Defendants announce, โThis is no \nlonger a peaceful protest,โ Dr. Liebeskind was standing on the \ngrass by Lisa Batisteโs porch. He could see lines of officers \nmarching as a unit with shields up, and heard from other \nFigure 40: A photo taken by Dr. Liebeskind \nmoments before his seizure shows that \nprotesters that they were approaching from the other \nhe was standing well back from the \nstreet and sidewalk.   \ndirection as well. The officers surrounded him and then \n \n \ncharged. Dr. Liebeskind froze and put his hands into the air. All he knew was that he didnโt want \n \n                                                           \n101 Video by Kelly Orians at 3:14. This video is incorporated into this complaint.  \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 64 of 82\nto antagonize the officers.  He was tackled to the ground by an arresting officer. On the ground, \nDr. Liebeskind said, โI am not resisting. I am not resisting.โ When directed to put his hands \nbehind his back, he tried, telling the officer โIโm trying, sir.โ But he couldnโt because one officer \nwas stepping on his right arm and shoulder, immobilizing it. An officer put a knee into Danielโs \nback and ziptied his hands. An officer then tried to pull Danielโs bicycle helmet off his head with \nbrute force, rather than undoing the clasp. One of the officers kicked Danielโs phone out of his \nhand, where it was permanently lost.  \n244. While waiting to be transported to the jail, Dr. Liebeskind had another protester \nemail his family with a phone. An officer came over and said a statement similar to: โWhat the \nHELL do you think youโre doing? Put that damn phone away or else I WILL come over there \nand break your face. Iโm a nice guy but you do NOT want to aggravate me!โ  \n245. Later Daniel shared with his friends that: \nBeing  rushed  by  police  in  riot  gear  may  be  the  scariest  thing  Iโve  ever \nexperienced. That experience โ that fear โ had an enormous influence on my \nthinking while in jail. I knew that I *should* go out again to stand up and speak \nout,  but  I  was  afraid.  I  kept  on  thinking  of  the  Kent  State  shootings  and \n[whether I] can help without putting my life at risk. . . .  it was the fear of police \nthat had me telling myself to stay home and not protest in the future. That fear is \nvery real, and for someone like me it is a STRONG deterrent.  \n \n246. Ultimately, Dr. Liebeskind decided to protest again in the future. He said that โI \nwill be back out there non-violently protesting to live in an America where a dead black person \nis NOT presumed guilty until proven innocent.โ As a result of the protest, Dr. Liebeskind had to \nbuy a new phone, new helmet, and new shirt. \n247. Alisha Feldman, Finn Phoenix, and Leah Fishbein. On July 10, 2016, Alisha, \nFinn, and Leah drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to join the youth-led march at the \ncapitol building, and then followed the march back to East Blvd. and France Street. They heard \nthe police say โget out of the streetโ and โthis is no longer a peaceful protest.โ So they got out of \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 65 of 82\nthe street and stood on the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street.  Then they heard \nthe police order protesters to get off of the sidewalk, so they retreated back to Ms. Batisteโs yard. \nIt was there that they were seized by the police.  \n248. Defendants lifted Finn off the ground \nby their neck, and then put them on the ground with a \nknee in the back. Finn couldnโt breathe. Finn is a \ndiabetic, and their insulin pump fell out of their \npocket.  It took repeated pleas to get an officer to \nreturn the insulin pump to their pocket. At the prison, \nafter a long time a medic took Finnโs blood sugar and \nsaid they were fine. But Finn received no further care \nfor their diabetes, even though they asked several times \nFigure 41: Red circle shows Defendants putting \nPlaintiff Finn Phoenix face-down in \nfor a snack to help them regulate blood sugar. A medic \nthe street.  \n \nfinally came back and said โwe donโt provide medical care u ntil you are booked, and you havenโt \n \nbeen booked yet.โ Finnโs throat was injured so badly that they could not swallow solid food. \nFinnโs neck and back were so sore that a doctor later diagnosed them with muscle bruising, and \nprescribed a course of muscle relaxers and physical therapy.   \n249. When Leah was seized by Defendants, she told them โIโm not resisting!โ The \nzipties binding her hands were so tight that her hands began to turn purple. At that point, she felt \nlike she was blacking out or disassociating as a result of the pain and fear.  \n250. In the days and weeks subsequent to her arrest, Leah felt very heightened levels of \nanxiety.  She saw a doctor about one week after the arrest for the pelvic injury she sustained, \nduring which her pelvic bone hit the ground so hard when Defendants tackled her that she was \nbruised from mid thigh to mid abdomen. She also saw a podiatrist about a month afterwards for \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 66 of 82\nfoot pain, because immediately after her arrest she began to suffer from toe and foot pain that \nworsened over time.  Her physical therapist diagnosed her with cervical/lumbar/thoracic spine \ninstability and postural dysfunction, which has resulted in neck pain, hip flexor pain, foot and \nback pain. \n251. When Alisha was seized, one Defendant was bending her hands in a way that \ncaused her pain. She cried out, and he bent it harder โ and said โthis wouldnโt happen if you \nwerenโt crying so loud.โ She has been having wrist problems since her arrest.  \n252. Subsequent to their treatment, Finn, Alisha, and Leah attended a group therapy \nsession to relieve their collective trauma/anxiety. \nFigure 42: Original artwork by Alisha Feldman. The image is an excerpt from a piece is entitled \nโNo Cops,โ and shows her arrest with depictions of the law enforcement officers omitted so that \nonly their effects are visible.  (Alisha Feldman, No Cops, August 2016.) \n \n \nThe Municipal Policies and Practices of the City/Parish, the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment and the East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office Caused the Violations of Plaintiffsโ \nConstitutional Rights.   \n \n253. The policies and practices of the City/Parish, the BRPD, the East Baton Rouge \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 67 of 82\nSheriffโs Office, and the other Agency Defendants were a motivating force behind and a \ncontributing cause of the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs suffered.   \n254. Defendants employed well-settled, inter-related de facto and explicit policies and \npractices to suppress the Plaintiffsโ exercise of their First Amendment rights and to otherwise \nviolate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, including: \na.  Criminalizing individuals who criticize law enforcement; \nb.  the control and termination of protest and dissent through the targeting for \narrest, detention, abuse, and denigration of perceived protest โleadersโ and, \nin particular, individuals who criticize the police; \nc.  failing to create and implement clear, understandable policies for the benefit \nof sworn police personnel regarding how to respond constitutionally to mass \ndemonstrations and spontaneous protest;  \nd.    failing to train sworn personnel on the importance of protecting and \nrespecting the exercise of First Amendment rights through assembly and \nprotest; \ne.  Directing the creation of pre-printed forms of affidavits of arrest, with facts \nalready pre-written. \nf.  the use of riot gearโi.e., military armamentsโsuch as shields, helmets with \nfacemasks, body armor, batons, rifles, and military vehicles without just \ncause and in order to frighten and intimidate those who wish to peacefully \nassemble to voice their concerns on issue of public importance, thereby \ncreating an atmosphere of tension;   \ng.  failing to discipline sworn personnel who use excessive force, engage in \nracist policing, prepare false reports, falsely arrest citizens, and/or violate \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 68 of 82\nFirst Amendment rights, thereby creating a culture of impunity in which \nofficers who commit such misconduct learn that they will suffer no adverse \nconsequences; \nh.  allowing a widespread practice of excessive force to continue unabated, \ndespite notice of the pattern and the full knowledge of policymakers;  \ni.  failing to create and implement a โstreet closureโ permitting process to \nenable those who wish to engage in demonstrations on matters of immediate \npublic importance to obtain a permit on an emergency basis (i.e., with \nwaiver of the 45 day notice requirement); \nj.  imposing onerous financial conditions on those who seek to engage in \nprotestโi.e., requiring proof of $1 million in liability insurance coverage \nand a receipt for rental of barricades.  \n255. The individual Defendants, including but not limited to the currently unknown \nLaw Enforcement DOES, acting on the instructions and with the approval of Defendants Holden, \nDabadie, Gautreaux, and Edmonson arrested Plaintiffs pursuant to one or more of the policies \nlisted in the preceding paragraph \n256. At all pertinent times herein, Defendants Holden, Dabadie, and Gautreaux were \naware that the policies, procedures, practices, customs, and usages they established for the \nCITY/PARISH, BRPD, and EBRSO would result in violations of constitutional rights. These \ndefendants ignored that risk and acted unreasonably, intentionally, and with knowing disregard \nfor Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights as described above. \n257. The policies and practices of the CITY/PARISH, BRPD, and EBRSO listed above \nwere implemented and applied intentionally with knowing disregard for the rights of Plaintiffs. \nThe policies and practices of the CITY/PARISH, BRPD, and EBRSO listed in were \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 69 of 82\nimplemented by the Defendants, working in concert to suppress the right of community members \nto petition the government for redress of grievances. \nIV. CAUSES OF ACTION \nOne - Violation of First Amendment Rights to Speech and Assembly \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants)  \n \n258. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n259. In Cox v. Louisiana, 379 US 559 (1965) (โCox IIโ) a group of peaceful civil rights \nprotestors were told by the Baton Rouge Police Chief that they must confine their demonstration \nto โto the west side of the street.\" The protesters complied. Law enforcement then ordered them \nto disperse, saying โ\"Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your \ndemonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of \nthe law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be broken up immediately.\" Law \nenforcement then swept in and arrested Rev. Elton Cox. The Supreme Court held that this \nviolated Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights.  \n260. History repeated itself in 2016. A group of peaceful civil rights protesters were \ntold by Baton Rouge law enforcement that they must move their demonstration out of the streets, \nand then off of the sidewalks. Each time, Plaintiffs complied. Defendants then told them to \ndisperse, declaring that it was โno longer a peaceful protest.โ Defendants then swept in and \narrested Plaintiffs.  \n261. Just as Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights were violated by Baton Rouge law \nenforcement in 1961, so too were Plaintiffsโ rights violated in 2016.  \n262. The protests in Baton Rouge are subject to heightened protection for the \nadditional reason that they are peaceful and conducted on public streets and sidewalks. \nโConsistent with the traditionally open character of public streets and sidewalks, [the Supreme \nCourt] ha[s] held that the governmentโs ability to restrict speech in such locations is โvery \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 70 of 82\nlimited.โโ McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2529 (2014). The government is โsharply \ncircumscribedโ in its authority to restrain expressive activity in โplaces which by long tradition \nor by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate.โ Perry Educ. Assโn v. Perry \nLocal Educatorsโ Assโn, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Public places, such as streets and sidewalks, \nthat are associated with the free exercise of expressive activities โare considered, without more, \nto be โpublic forums.โโ United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983); see also Snyder, 131 S. \nCt. at 1218 (observing that the Supreme Court has โrepeatedly referred to public streets as the \narchetype of a traditional public forumโ); Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, \n469 (2009) (noting โgovernment entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private \nspeechโ in โsuch โtraditional public foraโโ as public streets and parks); Frisby v. Schultz, 487 \nU.S. 474, 481 (1988) (finding that courts need not make any โparticularized inquiry into the \nprecise nature of a specific streetโ because โall public streets are held in the public trust and are \nproperly considered traditional public foraโ).  Any government act to silence speech may not \nโburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governmentโs legitimate \ninterests.โ Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S 781, 798-99 (1989).  \n263. Plaintiffs, and others like them, have since attempted to engage in peaceful protest \non the streets and sidewalks of Baton Rougeโthe very places which the Supreme Court has \ndescribed as having โimmemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and [which], time \nout of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between \ncitizens, and discussing public questions.โ Hague v. Comm. for Indus. Org., 307 U.S. 496, 515 \n(1939).   \n264. In some of Plaintiffโs arrests, the arresting officers explicitly linked the Plaintiffโs \nexpression to the reason why they were being arrested. For example, just before they arrested \nher, Defendants told Alexus they had seen her โflicking them off.โ  \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 71 of 82\nTwo - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Press \n(Plaintiffs Karen Savage and Cherri Foytlin Against All Defendants) \n \n265. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n266. Defendants violated Karen and Cherriโs rights under the First Amendment to \nfreedom of the press by interfering with their ability to gather information and cover a matter of \npublic interest as members of the media. When told that Karen was a member of the press and \noffered credentials, Defendant said โfuck you, journalistโ several times.  \n267. Observing and recording public protests, and the police response to those protests, \nis a legitimate means of gathering information for public dissemination that is protected by the \nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press clauses of the First Amendment, as applied to the \nstates under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendants engaged in \nthese unlawful actions willfully and knowingly, acting with reckless or deliberate indifference to \nPlaintiffsโ First Amendment rights. \n268. This was part of a pattern by Defendants. That weekend Defendants arrested Lee \nStranahan, a conservative journalist from the news site Breitbart, a self-professed critic of Black \nLives Matter critic, and a strong supporter of law enforcement. He reported โI did nothing to \nbreak the law. I was not obstructing traffic because with the road closed and police blocking the \nlane, there was no traffic. At no point did I hear the police give any order for me or anyone else \nto stay back. I was given no warning whatsoever; I was simply approached and forced to stop \nrecording.โ102   \n269. Ryan Kailath, an Indian American reporter for a New Orleans NPR affiliate, was \narrested while he was on the grass by the highway across from the police station.  Trying to \nmove away from an interaction with the police, he found himself surrounded by police who did \n                                                           \n102 Bill Quigley, Baton Rouge: โPut Those Damn Weapons Down!โ, Huffingtonpost.com, July 12, \n2016, citing Lee Stranahan, My Weekend Incarceration in a Baton Rouge Prison, Breitbart.com, \nJuly 12, 2016. \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 72 of 82\nnot let people leave.  He was charged with simple obstruction of a roadway despite \nhaving camera footage showing he was never in the road.103  WAFB Assistant News Director \nChris Slaughter was arrested when he put one foot on the highway to get a better angle for a \nvideo shoot.104  \n270. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants unlawful actions, Plaintiffs were \ndamaged. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 43:   A Defendant ordering Plaintiff and Reporter Karen Savage to stop taking pictures of \na group of officers handling a protester.  \n  (Photo by Karen Savage.) \n \nThree - First Amendment Retaliation \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n271. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n272. Plaintiffsโ assembly, speech, and newsgathering are protected activities under the \nFirst Amendment. \n                                                           \n103 Id., citing Ryan Kailath & Eve Troeh, WWNO Reporter Describes Arrest While Covering \nBaton Rouge Protests, WWNO, July 11, 2016. \n104 Amy Wold and Maya Lau, Alton Sterling protesters arrested in Baton Rouge to be \nprosecuted? DA Hillar Moore explains..., The Advocate, July 10, 2016. \n \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 73 of 82\n273. Defendantsโ arrest, use of force, and searches of Plaintiffs were intended to deter \nand chill their exercise of First Amendment Rights. \n274. For example, it seemed that Nadia and Antonio were targeted because they were \nleading chants.  \n275. As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs were damaged \nand chilled. \nFour - False Arrest and Imprisonment \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n276. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n277. Plaintiffs were arrested without probable cause or due process of law.  \n278. The Affidavits of Probable Cause signed by Defendants were perjured, fabricated, \nboilerplate affidavits that lacked specifics or even basic indicia of truthfulness. Arrest locations \non most were inaccurate by more than five miles.  The arresting officers were not the officers \nwho wrote up the affidavits. \n279. The officers could not have reasonably believed that they had probable cause to \narrest the Plaintiffs for any crime, considering that Plaintiffs had complied with their orders. This \nis especially so considering the United States Supreme Court had issued its rulings in Cox I and \nCox II.  \n280. Furthermore, a necessary element of both 14:97 and 14:100.1 is that the suspect \nactually blocks traffic. This was impossible, as Defendants had blocked off both East Blvd. and \nFrance Street with lines of officers several rows deep. \n \n73 \n \n\nFigure 44:    Three frames from a video taken by Plaintiff Victor Onuoha show lines of police \nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 74 of 82\nofficers blocking off East Blvd. (left and right) and France St. (middle). The \nirregular shapes are due to the fact that the phone was tilted at an angle. \n \n \n281. Furthermore, no Plaintiff actually resisted arrest. But even if they had, one of the \nelements of RS 14:108 (resisting an officer) is that the underlying arrest must be \"lawful.\" Thus, \nif Plaintiffs werenโt lawfully arrested for violation of 14:97 or 14:100.1, then they couldn't have \nbeen guilty of violating 14:108.  See State v. Ceaser, 859 So. 2d 639, 643 (2003) (\"An individual \nin Louisiana has a time-honored right to resist an illegal arrest.\"). \nFive - Violation of Fourth Amendment Rights to be Free from  \nUnlawful Search and Seizure \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n282. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n283. Plaintiffs have a right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. \n284. Defendants violated these rights when they arrested them, detained them, and \nused force on them without probable cause.  \n285. Defendants engaged in these actions willfully and knowingly, acting with \ndeliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n286. Additionally, when Tammy Cheney returned to her car, she found that Defendants \nhad gone through all the belongings in her car, damaged her trunk, and broken off her side \nmirror. This was an illegal search as there was no lawful justification for the search. It was not a \nsearch incident to arrest, because Ms. Cheney was not arrested in her car. It was not a search \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 75 of 82\nincident to impoundment, because the car was not impounded. It was not a search for evidence \nrelevant to the crime, because Tammy was arrested for Obstruction of a Public Passageway and \nResisting Arrest, two crimes that did not involve anything plausibly in a car.  \n287. Plaintiffsโ phones were searched and their property seized unlawfully.  \nSix - Excessive Force \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n288. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n289. The Defendants employed excessive and unreasonable force, or caused excessive \nand unreasonable force to be employed, in effectuating the arrests of Plaintiffs, as specifically \nalleged above, in violation of Plaintiffsโ rights under the Fourth Amendment.  \n290. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \nconstitutional rights. Defendantsโ misconduct was the cause of Plaintiffsโ injuries. \n291. In addition to the actions described above, the use of the acoustic LRAD weapon \non Plaintiffs constituted excessive force. LRAD devices were first developed around 2000, \ninitially for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  In addition to amplifying sound, LRAD devices can possess a high-pitched, volume \nadjustable \"deterrent tone\" that is marketed to law enforcement as useful for crowd control by \ncreating audible discomfort when used at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can \nresult in migraines, sinus pain, dizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as \nwell as tinnitus and hearing loss.105  \n292. For a Model 3300 LRAD, the space within 320 feet of the device is a zone labeled \n                                                           \n105 EDREI v. City of New York, 16-cv-1652 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2017) (Denying motion to dismiss \nregarding LRAD use as excessive force.) \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 76 of 82\na \"potential danger area.\"106 Here, Defendants used the LRAD on Plaintiffs at a range of \napproximately 60 to 80 feet.   \n293. The level of sound produced by these devices exceeds both the threshold for \nhuman discomfort (between 85 and 95 dB) and the normal human pain threshold (between 120 \nand 140 dB). \n294. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \nโexposures [greater than] 85 dB may cause hearing loss.โ \n295. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, โany sound over 90 dB can damage a personโs hearing. So the LRAD can threaten the \nhearing of anyone in its path, regardless of whether there is any wrongdoing.โ \nSeven - Failure to Intervene \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants.) \n \n296. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n297. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, \nanguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully \nabove.  \n298. During the events described above, the Defendants stood by without intervening  \nto prevent the violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, even though they had the opportunity and duty to do so.   \n299. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \nconstitutional rights.  \n300. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ failure to intervene, Plaintiffs \n                                                           \n106 Id. \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 77 of 82\nsuffered damages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, \nloss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above. \nEight - Civil Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Individual Defendants) \n \n301. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n302. Each of the individual Defendants, acting in concert with one another and other \nyet-unknown co-conspirators, conspired by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose \nby unlawful means.  Each of the individual Defendants took concrete steps to enter into an \nagreement in July 2016 to unlawfully detain, arrest, and imprison the Plaintiffs, knowing they \nlacked probable cause to do so, and for the purpose of impeding Plaintiffs from exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to protest by engaging in non-disruptive speech in support of an issue of \npressing public importance.   \n303. In furtherance of this conspiracy, each of the Defendants committed specific overt \nacts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of unlawfully silencing the Plaintiffs. They \naccomplished this goal by using excessive force to unlawfully effect the Plaintiffsโ arrests, \nfabricating evidence against the Plaintiffs, and approving trumped up charges against them, \nwhich resulted in their unlawful imprisonment.  \n304. In the implementation of the conspiracy, the officers, deputies and troopers of \neach of the law enforcement agencies led by Defendants HOLDEN, DABADIE, \nGEAUTREAUX and EDMONSON employed the customs and policies set forth above.  \n305. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ conspiracy, Plaintiffs suffered  \ndamages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of \nliberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above.  \n306.  Each individual Defendant is therefore liable for the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights \nby any other individual Defendant. \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 78 of 82\nNine - Monell Claim \n(All Plaintiffs Against Policymaker Defendants) \n \n307. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n308. The misconduct described above was caused by the policies, practices, and \ncustoms of Policymaker Defendants. \n309. The above-described widespread practices, which were so well settled as to \nconstitute the de facto policy of the Defendants, were allowed to exist because policymakers \nwith authority over these acts exhibited deliberate indifference to the problem, thereby \neffectively ratifying it.   \n310. This is clear both from the history of Defendant agencies described above, and \nmore specifically from the >100 wrongful arrests of protesters in the two days prior to Plaintiffโs \narrest. See the list of arrestees attached as Exhibit E. \n311. The policies, practices, and customs set forth above were the driving force behind \nthe numerous constitutional violations in this case that directly and proximately caused Plaintiffs \nto suffer the grievous and permanent injuries and damages set forth above. \n312. Defendants named in this Count, acting individually and together, under color of \nlaw, acted to violate Plaintiffsโ rights as set forth in the preceding claims. Policymaker \nDefendants have developed and maintained policies, practices, procedures, customs, and usages \nexhibiting deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens and residents of the \nCity/Parish, including but not limited to those policies, practices, procedures, customs, and \nusages described above, which caused the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights as described herein and \nthe resultant damages suffered. \n313. Policymaker Defendants had the power to prevent or aid in the prevention of the \nwrongs done and conspired to be done as described herein, yet failed or refused to do so, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 79 of 82\n314. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, \nsuffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal \nexpenses, as set forth more fully above. \n315. Moreover, the actions of all Defendants were directed, condoned, and/or ratified \nby Policymaker Defendants. \nTen - Violation of the Louisiana Constitution \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n316. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n317. Defendantsโ actions in arresting, detaining, and using force on Plaintiffs as \ndescribed above interfered with their exercise of fundamental rights to speech, assembly and \npress, as guaranteed by Louisianaโs Constitution. It also interfered with their state constitutional \nrights of privacy, freedom from false arrest and unlawful search and seizure.  \nEleven - Intentional and Negligence State Torts - Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent \nInfliction of Emotional Distress, Assault, Battery, False Imprisonment, Malicious \nProsecution, and Negligence \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n318. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n319. Defendantsโ conduct was extreme and outrageous; knowing that the emotional \ndistress suffered by the Plaintiffs was severe; and Defendants desired or acted with recklessness \nto inflict severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or \nsubstantially certain to result from their conduct. They maliciously commenced criminal \nproceedings against Plaintiffs using perjured and fabricated boilerplate Affidavits of Probable \nCause. They falsely told Tammy Cheney that she would be charged with child endangerment, \nand that her children would be taken away.  \n320. Defendants committed intentional offensive contact with Plaintiffs without right, \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 80 of 82\nand put the Plaintiffs in apprehension of such contact. \n321. They imprisoned and detained Plaintiffs without probable cause or justification, \nand breached their duty of care with regards to Plaintiffs. \n322. Defendantsโ actions were the cause-in-fact of Plaintiffsโ injuries.  \nTwelve- Vicarious Liability \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Supervisor Defendants) \n \n323. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n324. All supervisor Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs for the negligent and intentional \nacts and omissions of those under their direction and control pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code \narticle 2320 and the doctrine of respondeat superior.   \nThirteen - Indemnity \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Agency Defendants) \n \n325. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n326. Louisiana law provides that public entities are directed to pay any tort judgment \nfor compensatory damages for which employees are liable for actions taken in the discharge of \ntheir duties that are within the scope of their employment activities. \n327. While committing the misconduct alleged in the preceding paragraphs, some \nDefendants were employees, members, and agents of agency Defendants within the scope of \ntheir employment. \n328. Agency Defendants are therefore obligated by Louisiana statute to pay any \njudgment entered against their employees. \nFourteen - State Law Direct Action Claim \n(Against Defendant Insurance Companies) \n \n329. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n330. Defendant Insurance Companies, upon information and belief, have issued and/or \ncurrently have in effect one or more policies of insurance covering one or more of the \n80 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 59    01/02/18   Page 81 of 82\nDefendants named herein. For valuable consideration received, these policies obligated \nDefendant Insurance Companies, jointly and/or severally, to pay on behalf of their insured \nDefendant(s) any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become obligated to pay to Plaintiffs or to \nindemnify their insured Defendant(s) for any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become \nobligated to pay to Plaintiffs.   \n331. By reason of their illegal and unconstitutional acts, Defendants are liable to \nPlaintiffs for all damages and injuries Plaintiffs has suffered as a result. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant Insurance Companies are contractually obligated to pay these sums on behalf \nof the insured Defendant(s).  \n332. Upon information and belief, Defendant Insurance Companies are liable to \nPlaintiffs for any and all damages incurred by reason of the insured Defendant(s)โ acts, up to \ntheir policy limits, notwithstanding the fact that the insured Defendant(s) may themselves be able \nto assert claims of privilege or immunity from liability.   \n333. Under Louisiana Revised Statute ยง 22:655(B), Plaintiffs bring a direct action \nagainst Defendant Insurance Companies to recover any and all sums they are obligated to pay \nPlaintiffs on behalf of their insureds or to indemnify their insureds. \nVII.

On July 5, 2016, Baton Rouge police officers shot Alton Sterling to death. \n1  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 2 of 83\n \n2.  Mr. Sterling was a resident of Baton Rouge and the father of five children. His \ndeath was a tragedy, but not an aberration: in America in 2016, police killed at least one black \nman every forty hours.1  \n3.  In the days following Mr.Sterlingโs homicide, people gathered in Baton Rouge to \nspeak out about the pattern of police misconduct in Baton Rouge and the United States. Some of \nthem were Baton Rouge residents; others came from around Louisiana or other states to support \nthe community and to participate in the demonstrations. Reporters from all over the country and \nworld arrived to document the events. \n4.  On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led protest marched to the State Capitol \nbuilding, where participants spoke, sang, and prayed. Afterwards, the participants marched back \ndown Government Street. Where Government Street hits East Boulevard, law enforcement had \nset up a roadblock. Officers directed the marchers to get off of Government Street. The marchers \ncomplied and turned right onto East Blvd. A block down, the protesters stopped at the \nintersection of East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters gathered there and peacefully \nexercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n5.  Law enforcement officers by the score gathered across from the protesters, \nwielding automatic weapons, body armor and gas masks, and an acoustic weapon mounted on an \narmored vehicle.2 Officers blocked off the streets around the protesters.  \n6.  Law enforcement ordered the protesters out of the streets, and most of the \n                                                           \n1 Fatal Force,The Washington Post. 2017. \n2 The acoustic weapon is called an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device). LRADs were first \ndeveloped for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  LRADs are marketed to law enforcement for crowd control by creating discomfort when \nused at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can result in migraines, sinus pain, \ndizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as well as tinnitus and hearing loss.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 3 of 83\nprotesters โ including Plaintiffs โ complied, stepping back onto the sidewalks.  \n7.  Law enforcement then ordered the protesters off the sidewalks, and most of the \nprotesters โ including Plaintiffsโ complied. They stepped back into the yard of Lisa Batiste, a \nwoman who had given them permission to use her property. \n8.  But law enforcement said โwhere you are standing isnโt good enough.โ They \nordered the protesters to disperse โ an impossible order to comply with, since the police blocked \noff most of the surrounding streets, had already ordered the protesters to stay off the sidewalks, \nand were arresting people who stepped into the streets to leave. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1:    Plaintiff Raae Pollard peacefully protesting (left) and then lifted off the ground by \nher throat by Defendants (right). \n \n9.  Shortly thereafter, the officers swept in en masse, violently grabbing people and \nthrowing to the ground, pinning them, and binding their wrists painfully with plastic zipties. In \ntheir frenzy, the officers arrested a mix of protesters, reporters, and legal observers. The \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 4 of 83\narrestees, including Plaintiffs, were assembled into groups. Other officers wrote Affidavits of \nProbable Cause using pre-fabricated forms, most of which were written with facts from a \ndifferent event entirely. Plaintiffs were charged with โObstructing a Public Passagewayโ or \nโObstruction of a Highwayโ and โResisting Arrest.โ \n10.  Plaintiffs are thirteen protesters and two reporters arrested and jailed during this \npolice frenzy, even though they continuously complied with police orders and had done nothing \nwrong. Many Plaintiffs were injured. One Plaintiff was a 17-year-old girl put in an adult prison \nwith male inmates in violation of the Childrenโs Code. One Plaintiff was separated from her \nchildren, including a five-year-old who was taken from her and put into child protective services. \n11.  Defendantsโ arrest of peaceful protesters in Baton Rouge is not a new invention. \nIn 1961, the same story happened: Protesters gathered in Baton Rouge to speak out against racial \ninequality and law enforcement misconduct. They marched and then gathered on the sidewalks \nto make their voices heard. Baton Rouge police monitored the protest and then swept in to break \nup the protest. They arrested a man for alleged legal violations including โObstructing a Public \nPassageway.โ  \n12.  The man took his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court told the \nCity of Baton Rouge that its actions had violated the Constitution. It held in Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 U.S. 536, 558 (1965) (โCox Iโ) that it was โclearโ that Baton Rouge law enforcement \ncommitted a โunwarranted abridgment of [the protesterโs] freedom of speech and assembly \nsecured to him by the First Amendment.โ  \n13.  But Defendants did not learn from the Supreme Court's clear and unequivocal \nadmonishment. In 2016, they committed the same constitutional violations, using the same \ntactics, with some of the same criminal allegations. But this time, things are far worse: in 1961, \nDefendants arrested a single protester; in 2016, Defendants arrested approximately two hundred \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 5 of 83\nprotesters, reporters, and legal observers.  \n14.  This lawsuit focuses on three connected events that occurred on July 10, 2016. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the arrest of Tammy Cheney and her 17-year-old \ndaughter Alexus Cheney, and their separation from Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son A.J. and \ntheir dog Kelso. The third is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his \nwife Nadia Salazar Sandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. \nDefendantsโ actions that day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred \nafter July 10, 2016.   \n15.  Regarding the massive violation of constitutional rights that occurred on that day, \nBaton Rouge Police Department spokesman Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said that \"[a]nyone who feels \nthat something was unjustly done, they need to file a formal complaint.\"3  \n16.  Plaintiffs know โthat something was unjustly done.โ Here, they accept \nMcKneely's invitation \"to file a formal complaint.\"  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1985(3), to vindicate \ntheir rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. Plaintiffs also bring supplemental state-law claims. This Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, and 1367. \n18.  This case seeks remedies under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983, \n1985(3), and 1988. \n19.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 as a substantial part of \n                                                           \n3 Maya Lau, Identical arrest reports for many Alton Sterling protesters a red flag, legal experts say.

All of the Defendants (aside from the insurance companies) named in this \ncomplaint acted under color of state law at all relevant times.  \nIV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA Brief History of Defendantsโ Law Enforcement Misconduct \n63.  Baton Rouge law enforcement has a long history of misconduct and suppression \nof civil liberties. As described above, BRPDโs 1961 suppression of a peaceful protest and arrest \nof Reverend Elton Cox resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court opinion holding that it was โclearโ that \nRev. Coxโs First Amendment rights had been violated. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). \n64.  A year later, tensions between law enforcement and the Baton Rouge community \nescalated  after the alleged killings of two Black students by EBRSO deputies at a protest on the \ncampus of Southern University in 1972. \n65.  In 1980, the City of Baton Rouge and several dozen other municipal defendants \nwere placed under a federal consent decree intended to remedy racially discriminatory hiring \npractices of a class of Louisiana police and fire departments, including the BRPD. In the decades \nsince, nearly every municipal defendant reached compliance with the consent decree and was \ndismissed from the case โ but not the City of Baton Rouge.  \n66.  In September of 2005, the population of Baton Rouge swelled as many residents \nof New Orleans, a majority Black city, sought refuge from Hurricane Katrina and the resultant \nflood. The Michigan State Police and New Mexico State Police both sent troopers to assist the \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 15 of 83\nBRPD in policing the cityโs rapidly growing population. \n67.  Within three days of the troopersโ arrival, both state police agencies had ordered \ntheir troopers to cease operations with BRPD after the troopers witnessed and complained of \negregious misconduct and potentially criminal actions by BRPD officers.  One state trooper from \nMichigan said Baton Rouge police attempted to thank him for his help by letting him \"beat \ndown\" a prisoner.5 A spokeswoman for the Michigan State Police told a reporter that โtroopers \nobserved Baton Rouge police officers engage in actions that were an affront to their sense of \ndignity and respect.โ \n68.  Members of both the Michigan State Police and the New Mexico State Police \nshared observations and concerns that were compiled in a formal letter of complaint to the \nBRPD.6 One Trooper reported that โI personally believe that most of the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment are good officers that are being directed by their supervisors to crack down on the \npublic. I donโt know if they have been given any type of direction as to what is right or wrong.โ7 \n69.  As writer Jarvis DeBerry put it: โSo that's what we're dealing with: a police \ndepartment whose behavior worried other law enforcement officials and whose leadership has \nbeen more defensive than responsive to the claims of racist policing.โ8 \n70.  Examples of reported BRPD misconduct included multiple instances of excessive \nforce, including force directed at minors, through the use of tasering, hitting, choking, and \npepper spraying of residents, without warning or threat to the safety of officers or civilians; \nsearches of individuals and their vehicles without reasonable suspicion or probable cause; and \npossibly falsifying information in police reports.   \n71.  The Baton Rouge Police Department, under the direction of Defendant Holden \n                                                           \n5 Jarvis DeBerry, Before killing Alton Sterling, Baton Rouge police had a history of brutality complaints, \nThe Times-Picayune, July 6, 2016. \n6 The report is attached here as Exhibit A.   \n7 Id. at 9.  \n8 DeBerry, supra. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 16 of 83\nand predecessors in office of Defendant Dabadie, also resisted efforts of media and public \ninterest advocates to gain information regarding these post-Katrina abuses, as part of an ongoing \neffort to cover up and conceal officer misconduct, and to promote the police code of silence.   \n72.  In 2006, as part of the effort to cover up and conceal allegations of race-based \nofficer misconduct and to promote the police code of silence, the City/Parish and the BRPD \nactively resisted public records requests and a Public Records Law enforcement action filed by \nThe Advocate newspaper seeking access to the Internal Affairs Division investigative report. \nDefendant Dabadieโs predecessor in office authorized a meritless countersuit to delay and \nthereby shield investigation records from public view, while imposing high costs on the \nnewspaper.  \n73.  Also in 2006, Defendant Mayor Kip Holdren denied the NAACPโs suggestion of \na civilian oversight board for police.   \n74.  In 2011, then-BRPD Chief Dewayne White publicly stated that ten percent of the \ndepartmentโs officers failed to exercise basic levels of professionalism, and that โitโs become so \ningrainedโ in the minds of some officers that they โbelieve that everybody they come across or \nmost people they come across with that color of skin is probably a criminal.โ Defendant Mayor \nHoldren fired Chief White in 2013 and hired Defendant Dabadie in his place. \n75.  In September 2014, a series of racist text messages sent by a BRPD officer to a \ncivilian were published.  In the messages, the officer, a fifteen-year veteran of the department, \nreferred both to Black colleagues and civilians with racial epithets, and stated, inter alia, โI wish \nsomeone would pull a Ferguson on them and take them out. I hate looking at those African \nmonkeys at work . . . I enjoy arresting those thugs with their saggy pants.โ \n76.  The officer was placed on administrative leave by BRPD and resigned before any \ndisciplinary action was taken against him by the Department. On information and belief, no \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 17 of 83\naction was taken by Holden, Dabadie or the City/Parish to determine the extent of similar \nattitudes among other BRPD officers. Defendant Dabadie stated publicly that there was no need \nto do so, because the issue was confined to the lone officer. Defendant Dabadieโs conclusion is \nbelied by more recent stories, including reporting that a White BRPD officer texted his \ncolleagues protests a picture of a chimpanzee and the phrase โchimp outโ in the context of the \nAlton Sterling protests.9  \n77.  BRPD has also had a policy, practice, or custom of excessive use of force. Recent \nallegations include: \n(a) a 2007 arrest on a complaint of โloud musicโ with pepper spray and force that caused \nthe rupture of the arresteeโs bladder;  \n \n(b) a 2008 arrest for smoking marijuana that fractured the skull of the arrestee causing \ninternal bleeding and permanent brain damage;  \n \n(c) a 2011 incident in which an officer instructed a man, who advised the officer he was \nintoxicated, to move a vehicle away from the scene of the arrest; when the drunk driver \ncrashed the car, the officer shot him to death and shot a bystander in the arm;  \n \n(d) a 2014 incident in which BRPD officers strip-searched a visitor to a home which was \nbeing searched by the officers, then kicked the visitor with such force that his head \nslammed into the floor, knocking several teeth out of his mouth;  \n \n(e) a 2015 incident in which two members of the news media were handcuffed, and one \narrested, for taking pictures of an arrest;  \n \n(f) a 2016 incident caught on video in which a sixteen-year-old was held down by multiple \nofficers while one officer repeatedly punched him in the head;10 and  \n \n(g) the shooting death of Alton Sterling in July 2016.11  \n \n78.  In recent years, suits against the City/Parish for BRPDโs excessive uses of force \nand unconstitutional arrests have resulted in sizeable yearly settlements by the Parish Attorney. \nFor example, the City/Parish paid $372,434 to settle such cases in 2015, $581,286 in 2014, and \n                                                           \n9 Jim Mustian, Baton Rouge Officer suspended after alleged racial message about Alton Sterling protests, \nThe Advocate, May 22, 2017. \n10 DeBerry, supra. \n11 See Andricka Williams v. The City of Baton Rouge, 19th Judicial District Court. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 18 of 83\n$437,112 in 2011.   \n79.  Similar to BRPD, the East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office has its own history, \nextending decades before the July 2016 protests, of excessive force and unconstitutional arrests.  \nMore recently, allegations of excessive force and unconstitutional arrest leveled against EBRSO \nand Defendant Gautreaux have included multiple instances of excessive force through the \ninappropriate use of tasers, unconstitutional use of mace, and punching and kicking arrestees \nwithout justification.   Some of these allegations are documented in the following cases: Davis v. \nEast Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 08-00708 (M.D. La.) (resolved in private \nsettlement); Martinez v. Gautreaux, Civil Case No. 10-00847 (M.D. La.) (resolved in a private \nsettlement); Plaisance v. East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office, Civil Case No. 16-00365 (M.D. La.) \n(ongoing). \n80.  During Defendant Edmonsonโs tenure, the Louisiana State Police have also \nexhibited excessive force and unconstitutional arrest. While LSP does not typically patrol \nmunicipalities, a pattern of unconstitutional excessive force and illegal arrest has rapidly \nemerged in the brief time that Defendant Edmonson has directed LSP in the provision of policing \nservices in the City of New Orleans.  Suits filed against the LSP since early 2013 allege that \nmembers of LSP, under the direction of Defendant Edmonson, have:  \n(a) physically and verbally abused two Black teenagers without provocation or lawful \njustification, desisting only when one of the teenโs mother, a New Orleans Police officer, \narrived and intervened;  \n \n(b) pulled over, shoved to the ground, kicked, and threatened with firearms internationally \nrenowned musician Shamarr Allen while searching for a Black drug dealer โ apparently \nbased solely on Allenโs race;  \n \n(c) manhandled, tased, and verbally and physically assaulted Michael Baugh, a Black \nbarber, causing significant injury, apparently based on his being of the same race as four \nsuspects (Baugh matched no other part of the suspectsโ description). \n \n81.  Some LSP arrest reports involving officer uses of force show that the LSP \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 19 of 83\ntroopers write up the arrest report and then later rewrite the report to add allegations of resisting \narrest. \nBRPD Shot and Killed Alton Sterling, the Community Began to Make Its Voice Heard,  \nand Law Enforcement Implemented a Plan to Silence Them \n \n82.   The July 5, 2016, killing of Alton Sterling was documented on video. The video \nshowed Mr. Sterling being forcibly restrained on the ground and then shot. Mr. Sterlingโs death \nprovoked local, national, and international outrage.  \n83.  By the evening of July 6, 2016, Baton Rouge residents gathered for daily and \nnightly vigils and peaceful protests at various locations throughout the city.  Some paid their \nrespects in front of the Triple S Food Mart where Mr. Sterling was killed. Many protested on a \nsizeable grassy lot on Airline Highway, across the street from the headquarters of the BRPD.  \n \n \nFigure 2:    Community members gather at the Triple S.  \n \n(Photo by Marco Poggio, a photographer working with Plaintiff Karen Savage.) \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 20 of 83\n84.  In response to the large and growing protests and the national spotlight on \nprotestersโ nonviolent, lawful resistance, Defendants, led by Defendants Holden, Dabadie, \nEdmonson, Gautreaux and Cazes, developed and implemented a strategy. Their strategy was to \nsilence this peaceful and lawful exercise of First Amendment rights through intimidation, \nexcessive force, and illegal arrests and detention. Other law enforcement agencies not currently \nknown to Plaintiffs, joined Defendants in this endeavor.  \n85.  Between July 8 and 10, 2016, Baton Rouge area law enforcement officers and \ntheir agents โ including BRPD, EBRSO, LSP, deputy sheriffs of surrounding parishes, and \nincluding but not limited to the currently unknown Law Enforcement DOES  - put this plan into \naction. In furtherance of the above objectives, the Defendants unlawfully arrested approximately \n200 protesters as they engaged in peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment.  \n86.  At the same time, Defendants were downplaying their response to protesters. โWe \ndo not want to appear to have a military-style response,โ Defendant Dabadie said during a news \nconference early on July 9th, 2016. โWeโre there, weโre around, \nand weโre keeping everything safe, but weโve tried to be \nrespectful and reduce our presence at these events.โ12 As the \narrests of peaceful protesters were occurring, Defendant Col. \nMike Edmonson said he thought his troopers โdid well.โ13 \n87.  But by the evening of Saturday, July 9th, \nDefendants had escalated their actions towards the peaceful \nprotesters. Huffington Post senior crime reporter David Lohr \nstated that โone thing I noticed today as opposed to yesterday  Figure 3: Protester Javier Dunn was beaten so \nbadly by Defendants on July 9, 2016 that his eye \nsocket was fractured. A sheriffโs employee told \n                                                            him โ'that's what y'all get when you protest.โ1 \n12 Amy Wold, Bryn Stole, and Maya Lau.

Protester Javier Dunn was arrested by Defendants and beaten so badly that they \nfractured his eye socket โ although his Affidavit of Probable Cause stated that he was arrested \nโwithout incident.โ One of Defendantsโ employees said โ'that's what y'all get when you \nprotest.โ16 \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4:    On July 9, 2016, Defendant Officer Cat points her assault rifle at protesters and a \n \nreporter.

By that night, the jail was so full of protesters that the wardens had run out of \nblankets and handcuffs.17  \n91.  On Sunday, July 10, 2016, the human rights group Amnesty International sent an \nopen letter to the Baton Rouge police department, urging it to use more restraint and respect the \nrule of law in dealing with protesters.โWe would remind you that police authorities are required \nto act in accordance with international human rights standards and the U.S. Constitution,โ the \nletter read. โSpecifically, law enforcement must ensure that any decision to disperse an assembly \nis taken only as a last resort and carefully in line with the principles of necessity and \nproportionality.โ18 But Defendants did not heed Amnesty Internationalโs reminder of their \nconstitutional duties.  \n92.  Three primary incidents occurred that Sunday that give rise to Plaintiffsโ claims. \nThe first is the peaceful protest at France Blvd. and East St., in which most of the Plaintiffs were \narrested while standing on private property after clearing the streets and sidewalks in compliance \nwith law enforcement orders. The second is the separation and arrest of Tammy Cheney and her \n17-year-old daughter Alexus Cheney, and the seizure of Tammy Cheneyโs five-year-old son. The \nthird is the violent takedown and arrest of Antonio Castanon Luna and his wife Nadia Salazar \nSandi, who were standing at a street corner a few blocks from the protest. Defendantsโ actions \nthat day were so violent that no more large protests or marches occurred after July 10, 2016.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n17 Abigail Hauslohner, Robert Samuels & Ashley Cusick, As arrests mount in Baton Rouge, protesters \nquestion police tactics, Wash.

On July 10, 2016, a peaceful, youth-led march to the State Capitol was organized. \nParticipants marched from a church to the Capitol, and then gave speeches on the steps of the \nCapitol building.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3:    Heads are bowed at the prayerful protest on the steps of the state capitol building.  \n \n94.  Afterwards, the participants marched back down Government Street. When they \nreached the intersection of Government Street and East Boulevard, they had to stop because  law \nenforcement had set up a roadblock. The officers directed the marchers to get off of Government \nStreet.  \n95.  At about 5:40 p.m., the marchers complied and turned right onto East Blvd. A \nblock down, the protesters stopped and gathered at East Blvd. and France Street. The protesters \nthere peacefully exercised their First Amendment rights to sing, pray, and hold up signs.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 24 of 83\n \n  Figure 6:    Plaintiffs Raae Pollard, Blair Imani, and Akeem Muhammad make their voices heard at \nEast & France.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7:    Plaintiff Blair Imani stops to pray.  \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 25 of 83\n96.  Present at the protest was a corps of legal observers, trained by the National \nLawyers Guild to observe and document the protest and law enforcementโs response. The legal \nobservers can be identified in photos and videos by their fluorescent green hats. \n97.  Around 6:00 p.m., legal observers saw police staging at the end of Europe \nStreet.19  Shortly thereafter they saw approximately 40 to 50 police officers form a military-like \nformation on France Street, including an armored vehicle operated by an officer with a rifle.20 \n \nFigure 8:    A still image from a video shows Defendants in tactical gear blocking France Street. The \narmored vehicle with a mounted LRAD acoustic weapon is behind the officers. \n \n98.  Professor Bill Quigley, an attorney and law professor at Loyola University New \nOrleans, was present as a legal observer.  He introduced himself to an officer and was directed to \ntalk with the officer in charge.21  When Professor Quigley asked the officer how he could help, \nhe was told to tell people they had to clear the street in ten minutes or law enforcement was \ngoing to start arresting people. Professor Quigley and another legal observer relayed this \n                                                           \n19 Affidavit of Hannah Adams, NRBM, R.

Lisa Batiste, whose yard was right at the corner of East and France, gave her \npermission to the protesters to stand in her yard.22 Law enforcement was informed of this fact.23 \nMs. Batiste later explained: โI just wanted them to have a safe place to voice their opinions.โ \n100. All of the Plaintiffs who were present24 complied with the police order to clear the \nstreets. They stepped back onto the sidewalks, Ms. Batisteโs yard, and the grassy strips between \nthe sidewalk and street. 25\n \nFigure 9:    The Protesters โ including Plaintiffs โ comply with Defendantsโ orders to stand clear \n  of the streets. \n \n101.

Law enforcement then ordered the protesters off the sidewalks.26 Plaintiffs \ncomplied, stepping back into Ms. Batisteโs yard. \n103. The police proceeded down France Street towards East Boulevard in line \nformation with an armored vehicle, \nassault rifles, rubber bullet guns, gas \nmasks, shields, and a vehicle-mounted \nLong-Range Acoustic Deviceโ  Lines of police in riot gear\n(โLRADโ).

On video, Plaintiff Victor Onuoha pointed out how they are surrounded โ he said \nthere are police โleft, right, and dead in front of us.โ  \n106. Defendants then gave conflicting instructions, telling protestors both to (1) \ndisperse because their assembly was now unlawful and (2) that people in the street and on \nsidewalks would be arrested.29 (This is conflicting because use of the streets and sidewalks \nwould be necessary to disperse.) On video, Defendants can be heard to order the protesters on \nprivate property that โyou must leave now.โ30 But they also told the protesters: โ[Y]ou cannot \nleave. If you try to step into the street, we will arrest you.โ31 Some protesters who attempted to \nleave the area were chased, tackled, tasered, and arrested. 32  \n107. On video, the police can be heard to say: โwe understand you want to protest, but \nthis is not the time or place.โ33 They did not, however, give any indication what the proper time \nor place to protest was, or why this time and place was not permitted.  \n108. Although the character of the protest had not changed,34 law enforcement \nannounced via megaphone: โTHIS IS NO LONGER A PEACEFUL PROTEST.โ35  \n109.

Sister Alison McCrary, a Catholic nun with the Sisters for Christian Community \nand a certified mediator and community-police mediator trainer, tried to meet with the ranking \nofficers and explain that the warnings could not be heard on the sound system. Her attempts at \ndialogue were rejected.37 According to Sister McCrary, โI asked Major Cain and Sergeant D. \nCoppola of the Baton Rouge Police Department five times each if they would be willing to \nnegotiate a compromise. They repeatedly said no. I also asked other ranking officers if they \nwould be willing to negotiate a compromise. They repeatedly said no.โ38 \n111. The protesters did not understand how to comply with Defendantsโ conflicting \norders. According to legal observer Lilly Ann Ritter, โI also heard police officers tell people that \nthey needed to disperse several times. However, police were blocking all surrounding \nintersections and there was nowhere for people to go. Protesters who wanted to leave were not \nable to do so.โ39 According to witness Adina Arpadi, โProtesters were not sure what the police \nwanted them to do. It was clear to me that they wanted people to clear the street, but I think some \npeople couldnโt hear the instructions. Also, people were not sure where to go, and orders \nconcerning how long people had to clear the street were conflicting.โ40 According to another \nprotester, the โpolice kept saying that we werenโt allowed to be in the street and we werenโt \nallowed to block public passages, though they did not indicate what โpublic passageโ meant.โ41 \nAs one protester explained, โSome of the police instructions were vague and confusing.

The arrests were extremely violent, as indicated by the following contemporaneous, \nsworn descriptions by protester-witnesses and legal observers: \n124. โAt some point the police began lunging and arresting people seemingly at \nrandom.

When she heard about the death of Alton Sterling in July 2016, Tammy was \ntraveling through Louisiana with her seventeen-year-old daughter Alexus, her five-year-old son \nA.J., and their dog Kelso. They had been exploring the country, seeing historic landmarks and \nnatural sights, and were on their way back home to North Carolina.  \n136. Partly because of her personal experience, Tammyโs heart went out to the Sterling \nfamily when she heard of Altonโs death. She wanted to stand with them. She also wanted to give \nher children a way to understand what was happening. \n137. So on July 8, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended a peaceful protest in New \nOrleans about the shooting.  It was the first protest any of them had ever been to. Hundreds of \npeople gathered in Lee Circle to make their voices heard. NOPD monitored the situation, but \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 37 of 83\nallowed the protesters to exercise their First Amendment rights without interference or arrests.60 \n138. The New Orleans protest was so moving that the family decided to attend the \nchildren-led march planned for that Sunday in Baton Rouge.  \n139. On July 10, 2016, Tammy, Alexus, and A.J. attended the peaceful protest at the \nstate capitol building in Baton Rouge. Alexus described it later as being โsurrounded by so much \nlove and peace.โ After the protest, they marched back to the church where they had begun, ate \nsome food, and then got back in their car intending to continue their trip to North Carolina.  \n140. They followed the route Google Maps told them to take, but when they got to East \nBlvd. and Government St., the police had blocked off the road. So they pulled into a parking lot \nto wait until the road reopened and the traffic lessened.    \n141. Alexus decided to go around the corner to videotape what was happening. Tammy \nstayed at the car with A.J., standing on her car and holding up a sign with a political quote on it.  \n142. Alexus joined the protest at East and France. When she \nheard the police tell everyone to get on the sidewalk, she moved to the \nsidewalk. Then she heard the police say if they were on the sidewalk, they \nwould be arrested, so Alexus moved into Ms. Batisteโs yard. Then she \nheard the police order the protest to disperse, so she left and returned to the \ncar and joined her mother.  \n143. Tammy began to see officers with gas masks and shields \ngoing down the road. She told A.J. to get in the car and lock the doors. \nAlexus returned to the car. Tammy told her โAlexus, get in the car and Iโll \nbe right back โ Iโm going to take a couple more pictures and then weโll  Figure 18: Alexus is dragged \naway from the car where she was \nwatching her five-year-old brother \nA.J. and her dog Kelso.  \n                                                           \n60 Wilborn P.

According to a witness, \nTammy stepped away from the car for no more than a โminute, \nminute and a half.โ61  \n144. As soon as Tammy stepped away, three police \nofficers walked up to Alexus. They told her that they had seen her \nโon the front linesโ and that they had seen her flicking them off. \nThey said that Alexus โowed themโ for not arresting her and that \nthey could arrest her if they wanted to. Then they did arrest her.  \nFigure 19: Tammy runs back \n145. As she was being taken away, Alexus screamed  when she hears her daughter \nscreaming. \nโMOMโ and told the people around her motherโs name. The crowd \nbegan to shout โTammy!โ and โLet her go! Let her go!โ repeatedly.62 \n146. Tammy ran back to the car. A line of officers \nstopped her and said โNo, you canโt go this way. Go back.โ A \nwoman there was telling the officers, โShe didnโt do anything. \nShe didnโt do anything. They took her . . .  thatโs a minor.โ \nTammy said, โThey took who? They took who? They took my \nkid? My seventeen-year-old?โ She asked the police officer, \nโDid they take my daughter?โ An officer responded, โIf thatโs \nFigure 20: Tammy complies with the \nyour daughter, sheโs going to be there quite a while.โ  \nofficerโs order to stay in place, while \nasking about her daughter. \n147.

I was with her.โ Tammy told the officers, โI have a kid in the car. You guys just took \nmy seventeen-year-old away and left my kid in the car.โ The officer said โStay here with me.โ \nTammy complied. Desperate, she said quietly, โYou guys werenโt born this way. You can \nchange, you do know that?โ  \n148. The officers walked her to her car. She told the officers: โYou guys just took my \ndaughter away and she was watching my son.โ The officers said โCalm down, now weโre \nwatching you. Go over there- youโre under arrest too. Weโre gonna take your child.โ  \n149. Doe Defendant Officer Lapeyrouse told her, โYouโre going away for a felony. \nYou abandoned your son.โ Tammy told him, โThis is exactly why weโre here, weโre standing for \njustice.โ He responded, โDo you want me to throw another felony charge at you?โ Officer \nLapeyrouse tried to dispose of her phone in the bushes; another officer put it into Tammyโs bag. \nThe officers handled Tammy roughly, bruising her upper arms.  \n150. A few minutes later, Tammy and Alexus were seated on a curb together, along \nwith other women waiting to be taken to the prison. With her hands cuffed behind her back, \nTammy tried to console her sobbing daughter.63  \n151. Tammy and Alexus and the other arrested protesters asked the officers to look \ninto the car to make sure A.J. was okay. One of the officers asked Tammy and Alexus, โdid you \nlearn your lessonโ and refused to investigate to see if A.J. was okay until Tammy and Alexus \nsaid โyesโ they had learned their lesson.64  \n152. Tammyโs son A.J. was seized by child protective services.  \n153. Tammyโs dog Kelso was seized by animal control. \n154. Tammy and Alexus were taken to a holding cell, where they were held for \napproximately eight hours. Then they were split up and put into general population of the East \n                                                           \n63Savage, supra. \n64 NRBM, R.

In Tammyโs cell, the \nwomen huddled together under a mattress for warmth. They were given no toilet paper.  \n155. Despite Alexus being a juvenile, she was held in an adult facility. She was strip-\nsearched and forced to squat and cough. The cell near hers contained adult men.  She was \nexposed to pepper spray, and heard a male inmate being tasered because the male inmates had \nbeen clapping when women were released. She witnessed a woman inmate having her insulin \npump taken away from her.  \n156. While in prison, Tammy was distraught. Based on Doe Defendant Officer \nLapeyrouseโs statements, she thought she was going to be charged with felony child \nabandonment and that her children would be taken from her. She imagined them growing up and \nnot being a part of their lives. Tammy considered committing suicide in her cell.  \n157. Alexus was released at about 5:00 p.m. on July 11. Her mother had not been \nreleased yet, and Alexus was terrified. She was seventeen, abandoned in a strange city, and \nseparated from her mother, her brother, her dog, and their car. She told Defendants โIโm only \nseventeen โ you canโt just put me outside and leave me!โ They said to be quiet and that it wasnโt \ntheir problem. She had to wait seven hours until her mother was released at around midnight.  \n158. Although Tammy and Alexus got out of prison on July 11, they could not get A.J. \nback immediately. Defendants interfered with the process of them getting A.J. back. While \nTammy and Alexus were in the prison, Defendants barred the Child Protective Services worker \nassigned to A.J.โs case from visiting Tammy and Alexus. Defendant Lapeyrous untruthfully told \nthe Child Protective Services worker that A.J. had been โfound locked in his motherโs car at \nGovernment St. and East Blvd. while the parents went to the demonstration. Both parents are \nbeing arrested.โ  \n159. It was not until July 13, 2016 that Tammy got A.J. back with the help of a pro \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 41 of 83\nbono attorney. On that day, Tammyโs attorney showed video of the \nincident to the Assistant District Attorney in family court. \nImmediately after seeing the video, the ADA said the case would \nbe thrown out. Within fifteen minutes, Judge Pamela Taylor-\nJohnson ordered the state to immediately return A.J. to Tammy.65  \n160. A.J., being only five, did not understand what had \nhappened. He had heard on the radio about the killing of Alton \nSterling. And so when he saw police taking his mother and sister \naway, he thought that the police were going to kill them. 66 When \nFigure 21: On July 13, 2016, the \nfamily is finally reunited: Alexus, A.J., \nTammy and her son were finally reunited, the first thing she told him \nTammy, and their attorney Adrian \nRoss.  \nwas โI told you momma would never leave you, I would always be \n \nback to get you if something happened.โ67 A.J.โs fear was traumatizing to Tammy and Alexus. \n161. Even their dog Kelso was traumatized. He is now skittish around strangers or loud \nnoises.68 \nThe Take-Down of Antonio and Nadia \n162. On July 10, 2016, Antonio and Nadia drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to \npeacefully protest and show support for other people of color. They participated in the youth-\norganized march to the state capitol building, and then stayed afterwards to help clean up the \narea and provide water and snacks to community members. Then they returned to the office of \nthe Baton Rouge Youth Coalition to reflect on the dayโs events.  \n \n                                                           \n65 Savage, supra. \n66 Id. \n67 Id. \n68 Id. \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 42 of 83\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22: Antonio poses at the Capitol protest with two youth leaders. \n \n163. Someone gave Antonio and Nadia a ride back to their car, near the interstate on \nGovernment Street. Because law enforcement had closed several streets in the area, they \nhad to be dropped off several blocks away. As they were walking back to their car, they \nencountered the militarized police unit at the intersection of East Blvd and France Street.  \n164. They watched as the police escalated their activities against the protesters, and \nAntonio and Nadia joined the protesters in retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. They watched as \nofficers in full riot gear charged at the demonstrators, violently throwing them on the ground and \ndragging them away towards militarized vehicles. At this point, Antonio and Nadia feared for \ntheir lives, and rushed away towards safety, exiting Ms. Batisteโs property through the back \ngate.  They made their way to the sidewalk at the corner of Government Street and Maximillian \nSt. Officers there were blocking off Maximillian Street Southbound and then Government Street \nEastbound and Westbound. \n165.  Antonio and Nadia stopped to look for a friend so that they could get in their car \nand leave. While waiting for their friend, they led chants. For example, Antonio chanted โyou \ncanโt serve and protect with war weapons.โ Nadia was holding onto the pole of a stop sign, \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 43 of 83\nbecause she believed that by standing there they were \ncomplying with the officersโ orders and were safe from \narrest.  \n166. All of a sudden, several officers in riot \ngear tackled Nadia and Antonio to the ground, hard. \nOfficers piled onto them, held them down, and ziptied \ntheir hands. During this tackle, the officers wrenched \nAntonioโs ankle and knee.  \n167. Bystanders asked the officers why \nAntonio and Nadia were being arrested, since they \nFigure 23: Nadia and Antonio (red circle) holding onto \nthe street sign post as an officer (right) tackles Nadia \nhadnโt been in the street. It seemed that they were \nfrom behind.

Only after Antonio and Nadia were \ntackled to the ground can officers be heard on \nvideo ordering bystanders to โclear the \nsidewalk.โ70 A witness can be heard to say that \nAntonio โwas just standing there. He was just \nstanding there.โ71 A dozen or more people \ncontinued to stand on the sidewalk right by where \nFigure 24: Five officers tackle Antonio and Nadia to the \nground. \n                                                           \n \n69 A video taken by a witness and incorporated into this complaint shows the event.

[Antonio] was specifically targeted.โ73  \n169. The zipties were so tight that Nadiaโs \nhands began to turn purple74 and Antonioโs hands \nbegan to tingle and go numb.    \n170. As the officers walked Nadia and \nAntonio to some large vehicles, Antonio asked why \nFigure 25: Nadiaโs face is pushed to the ground next to \nan officerโs foot as Defendants ziptie her hands. As the \nthey were being arrested. An officer responded, โI  video shows, at no point do Nadia or Antonio make any \nmove to resist arrest.  \ndonโt know.โ75 An officer bent Nadiaโs arms and said   \nโAlton Sterling was a murderer.โ  \n171. As Nadia and Antonio were separated, Nadia was terrified, but told Antonio, \nโbaby, I love you, Iโm fine.โ But privately she thought that this was perhaps the last time she \nwould see her husband. \n172. As she was being walked away, Nadia heard an officer say โtake her the long \nway.โ She didnโt know what this meant, but it caused her to fear for her life โ and so she began \nyelling her name and birth date to ensure that she was not disappeared. \n173. Antonio heard an officer tell a protester to โshut your mouth, or get your head \nbashed in.โ Antonioโs ankle began to swell so much that his shoe was cutting off blood flow. He \nasked for medical attention but was ignored by the officers.  \n174. They were loaded into vans and transported to the jail, but not seatbelted. \n175. At the jail, an officer asked Antonio for his information to write him up. The \n                                                           \n72 Id. \n73 Id. at 9:10. \n74 NRBM, R.

Antonio pointed out his ankle injury again, but was not treated. \n176. Nadia was strip-searched twice at the prison, and required to remove her bra. A \nwhite woman asked to keep her bra, and the guard said yes. Nadia asked to keep her bra, and the \nguard said no. Nadia was given no blanket in the cold jail cells. She was exposed to mace.  \n177. At the prison, law enforcement officers spelled her name differently on different \nforms. She recalls the following variations: Madye Salvar, Nadye Salva, Nadia Salvar , and the \ncorrect Nadia Salazar Sandi. \n178. At one point at the prison, a guard came and requested volunteers.  Antonio had \nno idea what would happen next, but stood up and requested medical attention. The guard told \nhim to shut up and get in the volunteer line. Another protester told the guard that Antonio needed \nto get my ankle looked at and the guard replied โyes, I heard him already.โ \n179. According to the sworn statement of protester Julien Bond, โI noticed at this time \nthat one other arrestee โ Antonio โ requested medical care because his ankle was swollen from \nbeing dragged but his request was ignored.โ76 \n180. At approximately midnight, Antonio was taken to the doctorโs station. He told \nnurses what happened to his ankle, and they gave him a leaky bag of ice. A doctor swung by but \nsaid he couldnโt help because he didnโt have the time. Antonio was given some anti-\ninflammatories. The doctor came by again later, looked at the ankle, and said โthis is not good.โ \nAfter the ice melted, Antonio was made to sign a medical form and was taken back to the area \nwith the holding cell.    \n181. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country with a history of violence and \n                                                           \n76 NRBM v. BR, R.

But she says that โeven with all the oppression in Bolivia, I donโt remember anything \nlike what I experienced in Baton Rouge.โ  \nPlaintiffs Were Arrested with Perjurious Affidavits of Probable Cause  \nThat are Facially False and Contradictory  \n \n182. After being seized by Defendants, Plaintiffs were assembled into groups with \nother arrestees.  Other officers โ not the ones that had grabbed them โ wrote Plaintiffs up using \npre-printed affidavits. Each Plaintiff was written up for two crimes โ โResisting Arrestโ (R.S. \n14:108) and either โObstruction of a Highwayโ (R.S. 14:97) or โObstruction of a Public \nPassagewayโ (R.S. 14:100.1).77  \n183. The primary difference between the two obstruction statutes is that 14:100.1 \ncriminalizes blocking roads and sidewalks, while 14:97 only applies to roads. There is no \ncorrelation, however, between where the Plaintiff was standing when arrested and which crime \nthey were charged with. \n184. According to The Advocate, for โ132 of the 176 incident reports of protesters \nprovided by the Baton Rouge Police Department, police used one of two versions of boilerplate \nlanguage.โ78 This was a red flag for LSU law professor Scott Sullivan, who reviewed the \naffidavits obtained by The Advocate:  \nProbable cause requires not just the sense that a defendant may have committed a \ncrime, but that this particular defendant at a particular time and place committed a \nparticular crime  . . .What seems to be missing is a careful consideration of this \nparticular defendant's actions. . . That sense [that a crime was committed]   is \nundermined when you just see a repeated narrative over and over again without \nmuch deviation.79 \n \n185. Thirteen of Plaintiffsโ affidavits of arrest have been obtained from the Clerk of \nCourt. (The clerk has no affidavit for Plaintiffs Victor Onuoha and Nadia Salazar Sandi.) The \n                                                           \n77 See Exhibit C to this Complaint. \n78 Maya Lau, Identical arrest reports for many Alton Sterling protesters a red flag, legal experts say. The \nAdvocate.

False Location. The affidavits were pre-written with facts that described an incorrect \nlocation. Eleven of the thirteen affidavits say that the protests were โin the vicinity of \nBaton Rouge Police Departmentโs Headquarters at 9000 Airline Highway.โ Plaintiffs \nwere actually arrested nearly six miles away, in the vicinity of East Blvd. and France St. \n \n  Figure 26:   Excerpt from Affidavit of Raae Pollard.  \n \nFigure 27:   Map of distance โ 5.8 miles โ from location identified in Affidavit \n  to actual location of arrest.  \nb. No Parking Lots. All thirteen affidavits say โProtesters assembled at provided parking \nareas and in surrounding parking lots.โ There is no parking lot at East and France. \n \nc. Wrong Address for BRPD HQ. Four of the affidavits have โ9000 Airline Highwayโ \ncrossed out and replaced with โ500 East Blvd.โ This renders these affidavits even more \ncontradictory, because the affidavits then read โin the vicinity of Baton Rouge Police \nDepartmentโs Headquarters located at 500 East Blvd.โ โ which is not the BRPD \nHeadquartersโ location.  \nFigure 28: Excerpt from Affidavit for Blair Imani, showing address \ncrossed out. The resulting affidavit 4is7  false โ BRPDโs headquarters is \n  not at 500 East Blvd. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 48 of 83\nd. Felonious Misdemeanors? Each of the affidavits says the โDefendant did knowingly \nand feloniouslyโ violate R.S. 14:97 or 14:100.1. Both those statutes, however, describe \nmisdemeanors. \n \ne. False Description of Plaintiffโs Conduct. Each of the affidavits says: โDuring the \nprotest, the Defendant entered the roadway and was provided another verbal order to \nexit the lanes of travel. Moments later the Defendant entered the roadway again and was \ntaken into custody by Officers on the scene.โ This is not a true description of the seizure \nof any Plaintiff.  \n \nf.  Contradictory Statutes. Two of the affidavits are contradictory as to what crime is \nbeing alleged. In the synopsis, they say the Plaintiff violated โLRS 14:97,โ but \nelsewhere 14:97 is crossed out and replaced with 14:100.1. \n   \nFigure 29:   For two of the Affidavits, the officer was inconsistent \nabout what crime was being alleged.  \n \n \ng. False Statements About Miranda Rights. Each affidavit says the defendant was \nโverbally advised of their rights per the Miranda ruling.โ This is false โ Plaintiffs were \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 49 of 83\nnot all read their Miranda rights. Some Plaintiffs even asked to be read their rights, but \nwere refused.  \n \nh. One Consistent Truth: Affidavits Say The Protests Were Peaceful. One thing is true \nabout every affidavit: every single one of them describes the protests as โpeaceful.โ   \n \n            Figure 30: Excerpt from Affidavit for Raae Pollard \n \nThe Aftermath \n186. Defendantsโ illegal plan to silence the communityโs voice was disturbingly \nsuccessful. There were no more major protests following the dozens of seizures, beatings, and \narrests of protesters on Sunday, July 10. Defendantsโ efforts had the actual effect of chilling the \ncommunityโs exercise of its First Amendment rights.  This is clear from contemporaneous \nstatements by protesters:  \na.  โSince the protest, I have not been able to shake a feeling of fear and \nsadness. To be immediately in front of a police force that wields so much \npower and to know that they do not respect the law, makes it feel impossible \nto protest.โ80  \n \nb.  โI am too afraid to return to Baton Rouge. I was so scared the entire time. \nWe didnโt come to get arrested. We didnโt come to get killed. We just came \nto protest and to get justice for Eric. They treated us so badly.โ81 \n \nc.  โAfter all this, I am now aware of the incredibly high risk of protesting. I \nwas definitely afraid.โ82  \n \nd.   โI had planned to protest in upcoming marches, though will likely not do so \n                                                           \n80Aff. of Caressa Chester, NRBM, R.

Even the trained Legal Observersโ activities were chilled: โBecause of the actions \nof the police I was very afraid someone would get shot or that they would tear gas us. The police \nwere arresting Legal Observers as well as civilians. It is frightening to think about Legal \nObserving in the aftermath of what I witnessed.โ84 Sister McCrary reported that โI am terrified to \ntry to negotiate with the police again in Baton Rouge. I am \nscared to serve as a Legal Observer in Baton Rouge. I do \nnot feel comfortable training Legal Observers and placing \nthem in harmโs way in Baton Rouge.โ85  \n188. Shortly after the protests, the United \nNations Special Rapporteur On The Rights To Freedom Of \nPeaceful Assembly And Of Association made a visit to \nBaton Rouge. On July 27, 2016, he spoke out against the \nlaw enforcement practices in Baton Rouge: โIt is manifestly  Figure 31: The constitutionality of \nDefendants treatment of Plaintiffs is \nfront page news on July 12, 2016. \nunwise to respond to a largely peaceful, grieving crowd with riot \n \ngear, random arrests, flimsy charges, rough physical handling, verbal insults and so forth. This is \nnot only a violation of the right to peaceful assembly, it also \ndangerous for participants, the general public and police \nofficers. \n189. By July 31, 2016, the East Baton Rouge District \nAttorney had posted an ACLU guide entitled โKnow Your \n                                                            Figure 32: The District Attorney posts  on \n83 Aff. of Alissa Luis, NRBM, R.

A government spokesperson even admitted that protesters had been targeted for \narrest based on their speech: โI think the law enforcement folks have a strategy of identifying \nthese folks and while they might not move in to actively arrest the agitators at the moment that \ntheyโre causing problems, it might be a delayed arrest,โ said Richard Carbo, the spokesperson for \nthe Governor.87 \n191. Despite the widespread consensus that there was a problem with law \nenforcementโs handling of the protesters, Defendant Louisiana State Police Col. Mike Edmonson \ndenied that his troopers had done anything wrong. He said that they โused incredible restraintโ in \ntheir response to protesters88 and said โI was certainly pleased with what I saw here.โ89  \n192. But Lt. General Russel L. Honore, the retired U.S. Army leader who coordinated \nmilitary response efforts after Hurricane Katrina, felt differently. After reviewing hours of \nvideos, imagery and other coverage of protests in Baton Rouge, he said:  \nThe gas masks themselves were pretty intimidating . . . My concern is, with those homes \nthere and all the people in the houses, that would not have been a good place to do (show \n                                                           \n86 Exhibit D to this Complaint. \n87 Maya Lau, Helping or hurting?

Something is \nnot right in that department in terms of amount of equipment and amount of training.90 \n \n193. A year after the protests, Defendant Dabadie acknowledged problems with the \nJuly 2016 handling of protests. He said โWe were not perfect in the first round of the protests, \nand we had some things that we needed to correct.โ91 But Defendants have said they will respond \nto future protests in much same way,92 albeit with some โtacticalโ changes.93   \n194. Shortly after the July 10 protests, a tragedy occurred.  Three Baton Rouge law \nenforcement officers โ Brad Garafola, Montrell Jackson and Matthew Gerald โ were killed by a \nKansas City man. Plaintiff Blair Imani organized a One Baton Rouge Vigil for Fallen Officers. \n\"All violence is wrong,\" she said. \"Yes, I've always been \nagainst police brutality but violence is wrong and this is \nnot the right way.\"94   \n195. It is now a year later. Defendants continue \ntheir practice of arresting and using force on protesters. On \nJuly 5, 2017, the anniversary of Alton Sterlingโs death, \nBaton Rouge police used stun guns and PepperBall guns \non protesters and arrested seven.95 \n  Figure 33: On national television, Representative \nJohn Lewis praises the actions of Plaintiff Blair \n  Imani โ that within one week she was arrested by \nBaton Rouge police and also organized a vigil in \ntheir honor.  \n                                                              \n90 Maya Lau, Helping or hurting?, supra.   \n91 Staff Report, Baton Rouge police chief, sheriff say officers better p repared for any protests related to \nAlton Sterling decision, The Advocate, May 2, 2017.   \n92 Bryn Stole, Baton Rouge law enforcement discussing how to respond to possible protests after Justice \nDepartment Finishes Alton Sterling investigation.

Blair and Akeem are both graduates of \nLouisiana State University. During the protest, they attempted to forestall confrontation between \npolice and protesters. Blair explained that โWe were trying to quell antagonism โ instead of \nshouting โF the Police,โ we were trying to get people to shout Alton Sterlingโs name.โ96 They \nworked together to help other protesters comply with the police orders to clear the streets. But \nwhen the crowd chanted โThe whole world is watching,โ they observed the police get angry and \nbegin to escalate the situation.  \n197. Blair and Akeem heard the police announce that being on private property is not \ngood enough and you have to leave the area โ but they were surrounded by police and had no \nway to leave. When the police rushed Ms. Batisteโs yard, \nBlair and Akeem were grabbed and thrown to the ground. \nSister Alison McCrary witnessed a โgroup of officers \ntackle [Blair], pull off her hijab head scarf, and arrest \nher.โ97 Blair and Akeem were trampled by officers as \nthey lay on the ground. \n198. Defendants knelt on Akeemโs neck and \nFigure 34: Yellow circles show Akeem and Blair \nback to hold him down, even though he was compliant \nunderneath Defendants. \n  \nwith his fingers splayed open.98   \n \n199. Blair heard an officer shout โReally give it to he r,โ so she became terrified that \nshe was going to be beaten out of view of the cameras and other observers. โI started screaming, \n                                                           \n96 Robert Mackey, Baton Rouge Police Sued Over Arrest of Peaceful Protesters.

The zip ties on her hands were so tight \nthat her hands turned purple.  \n200. Blair has had to seek the services of a trauma therapist after these events. Akeem \nhas experienced recurring neck problems.  \n201. Less than a week after her arrest, Blair helped organize a vigil with the Louisiana \nState University Student Body Association in response to murder of three Baton Rouge police \nofficers. Representative John Lewis spoke of Blairโs actions on TV, and drew a direct \ncomparison between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and what Blair and other young \npeople are doing in the present. \n202. Raae Pollard and Sami Nichols. Raae and Sami came from New Orleans to \nBaton Rouge for the protest. The two of them complied with police orders to clear the streets and \nsidewalks. Raae was especially concerned about following their orders, because she is a green \ncard holder from Australia.  \n203. When Raae was on the yard, police said โwhere youโre standing is not good \nenough.โ But Raae didnโt understand what she was supposed to do โ she was on private property \nand surrounded by police.  She waited to get more specific directions from the officers. Raae and \nSami were standing on Ms. Batisteโs lawn when they were grabbed by Defendants. When she \nwas grabbed, Raae let her body go limp, like a ragdoll, to put up no resistance to the officers. \nRaae turned and saw Samiโs head smashed into the road.  A witness wrote that she โsaw Raae \nthrown to the ground, then Sami smashed on to pavement, tackled with the force of a \nlinebacker.โ \n204. Raae saw a female officer in a purple shirt and bulletproof vest push Samiโs face \ninto the concrete and say โtrashy bitch . . . go back to California.โ  \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 55 of 83\n205. Another witness, Jessica Pinkham, \nwitnessed the officer stomp on Samiโs head. She wrote: \nโ[Sami] sustained a concussion due to a female police \nofficer, who had brandished her assault rifle at peaceful \nprotestors, stomping on her face on the ground.โ She \nsaid that the officer she saw was wearing a purple shirt \nand had a photo in The Advocate on July 11, 2016.  \n206. The officers who seized Raae and Sami \ndid not write them up. The officers had forgotten who \nFigure 35: Sami being arrested by the purple-\nshirted officer who stomped on Samiโs \ngrabbed who, and so they split up the arrestees at \nhead and said โtrashy bitch . . . go back \nto California.โ \nrandom. Raaeโs zip ties were so tight that she almost \n \n \nfainted. They had to be removed by officers.  \n \n207. As a result of Defendantsโ violence Sami suffered a head injury, and was passing \nin and out of consciousness. Once they were detained at the prison, a witness said that \nโsometime around 10:30 pm, a medic in blue scrubs came by, poked him head into the cell, and \nsaid โeveryoneโs fine.โโ Blair Imani, who had EMT training, was concerned that Sami might \nhave a concussion. When the medic returned she asked him to look at Sami and do a state of \nconsciousness test. Blair specifically told the medic that she thought Sami might have a \nconcussion. The medic said โโIโm not the hospitalโ and walked away.โ99  \n208. The day after they were released, Sami and Raae went to University Medical \nCenterโs emergency room. They gave Sami pain medicine and muscle relaxers. Raaeโs father in \nAustralia had a panic attack when he saw the news, which terrified Raae.  \n \n                                                           \n99 Aff. of Marina Sparagana, NRBM, R.

Two days after her arrest, Tammy said โThis experience scared the daylights out \nof me, and I will never go to a protest again.โ100 She has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Complex and Major Depressive, Recurrent, Severe Without Psychosis. She has \nbeen prescribed bi-weekly individual therapy. As of November 2016, her licensed clinical social \nworker assessed that she could not work at all โdue to the severity of emotional and cognitive \nimpairments.โ The social worker estimated that the impact of the condition on Tammyโs ability \nto work would be expect to last โ[m]ore than 12 months.โ \n211. On October 9, 2016, Tammy shared the following description of her feelings with \nher friends: \nEvery day is a mental struggle. I convince myself daily that im ok and am \nreleaved at the end of the day i made it. I cant watch anything that reminds \nme of that time, without feel the devastation that i went through all that \ncrap. I dont trust anyone. Walking in fear constantly, got robbed for 350$ \nthe  other  day  trying  to  move  into  new  place  and  it  was  a  scam  on \nCraigslist and couldn't call cops to report it, because im scared to death of \npolice and what they are capable of doing. Sorry to through all this on you. \nBut it is all i have on my mind \n \n \n212. Alexus Cheney. Alexus was mistreated by Defendants as described above. \nAlexus, though only seventeen, was housed in an adult prison with both male and female \ninmates. She was required to take off all her clothes, squat and cough, during a strip-search. \n213. As a result of everything that happened to her, Alexus has struggled with post-\ntraumatic stress. She has suffered from depression and anxiety, and says that she has โlost a lot \nof competence.โ She has been asking herself, \"What is wrong with us? What did we do to \ndeserve this?\" As a result of these impacts, she dropped out of school. She tried to get a GED but \ncouldnโt. The incident has affected her relationship with her mother.  \n                                                           \n100 NRBM, R.

Victor was a thirteen-year resident of Baton Rouge, and had just \nmoved to Gretna before Alton Sterling was shot. On July 10, Victor drove with his girlfriend to \nbe a part of the march to the capitol. Afterwards, they parked and then joined the protest at the \npoint when people were retreating to Ms. Batisteโs yard. He was standing in Ms. Batisteโs yard \nwhen he was arrested by Defendants.   \n215. Antonio Castanon Luna and Nadia Salazar Sandi. Antonio and Nadiaโs arrests \nhave caused lasting problems for them. Due to her trauma of being in a cold jail cell, Nadia now \nbecomes afraid when she gets cold, and shakes at night. Nadia has had trouble sleeping and has \nhad nightmares. Because her arrest was televised, it causes Nadia a great deal of stress to know \nthat the cousin she raised saw her getting arrested. \n216. Nadia is originally from Bolivia, a country that has historically used police force \nto stop peaceful protesters. She did not expect to experience the same thing in โthe land of the \nfree.โ As a result, she has found herself more cautious about speaking out about things after her \narrest, even on social media. She says โI feel like my first amendment right was stripped from \nme from that day on.โ \n217. Antonio has had lasting problems with his knee and ankle, and has had to seek \nmedical treatment repeatedly. He has felt anxiety, especially when reflecting on his arrest or \nwhen participating in public demonstrations. \n218. Due to the traumatic events of July 10 and 11, Antonio and Nadia decided to \nmove back to Maryland to be closer to family. This was expensive and difficult as they had been \nbuilding a life in New Orleans.  \n219. Despite the way they were treated in Baton Rouge, Antonio and Nadia returned to \nhelp the communities afflicted by the August 2016 floods. They gutted homes damaged by flood \nwaters and passed out clothes and other essential items.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 58 of 83\n220. Karen Savage. Karen Savage is a reporter with the Juvenile Justice Information \nExchange (โJJIEโ). In July 2016, Karen and her photographer Marco Poggio were on assignment \nfor JJIE, covering youth reactions to the killing of Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police officers \nBlane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.101  She had a press pass from the CUNY Graduate School of \nJournalism.  \n221. On July 9, she and her team reported from the Triple S market where Mr. Sterling \nhad been killed. That evening, she observed the protest at Airline Highway. She observed a \nshort, white female officer with an assault rifle. She observed that the female officer โhad it up \nand was aiming it at the protesters and waving it back and forth.โ \n222. On July 10, while Marco edited video, Karen spent the morning and early \nafternoon emailing back and forth with a police communications person. They missed the capitol \nprotest due to traffic, and arrived to observe the protestors once they had assembled at East Blvd. \nand France Street. She saw officers wearing combat gear with a tank-like vehicle. Despite having \nreported on and attended dozens of protests, Karen had never seen a police response anywhere \nclose in kind to what she saw in Baton Rouge. She wrote: \nIโd been to protests in New York, Boston and elsewhere and have encountered \nheavily armed police. Iโd seen armored vehicles and heard LRADs before. But \nnever before had I witnessed officers risking the safety of so many, including \nthemselves โ not on the Mass Turnpike in Boston, not in Times Square and not \nmore recently on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where I had covered anti-police \nbrutality protests before being sent down to Louisiana. In Baton Rouge, it seem as \nif the police came ready for war. 102 \n \n223. She watched the protesters mostly comply with police orders to clear the streets \nand sidewalks. Once the police ordered the protesters to disperse and started making arrests, \n                                                           \n101 Karen Savage, Reporter Recounts Arrest, Prison Stay After Baton Rouge Protest. Juvenile Justice \nInformation Exchange, July 22, 2016. \n102 Id. \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 59 of 83\nKaren moved away towards the McDonalds a few blocks away, taking pictures as she went.103 \n224. She was walking towards the door of the McDonaldโs when an officer grabbed \nher from behind and shoved her to the ground. โAre you resisting?โ he asked. โI'm a journalist, \nmy credentials are in my right pocket, you can take them out,โ Karen said, using the calmest \nvoice she could muster. She feared to put her hands into her pockets herself.  โFuck you, \njournalist,โ he shouted from behind Karenโs ear. โYou donโt listen.โ  Eventually, Karen stopped \nsaying she was a journalist because this seemed to make the officer angrier.  \n225. The officers ziptied her hands together โ so tight that her hands hurt, then went \nnumb, and then began to change color. โCould you loosen it a little? Please,โ Karen asked. \nโWhich one hurts?โ he replied. She nodded silently toward her left hand, then puffy and bluish \nred. He grabbed the plastic cuff on her right hand, grunted, and pulled it tighter. \n226. Another officer showed her a large serrated knife and jokingly offered to use it on \nher. Karen heard someone yell her name and she turned to see a friend up the block. She tried to \nshout her editor's email address to the friend, but the pain made it hard to remember. โShut up, or \nwe'll arrest her, too,\" said the officer with the knife. The officer who first grabbed her said again, \nโFuck you, journalist.โ \n227. Karen was handed off to another officer. The pain in her hands had become so \nintense that Karen began to get dizzy. Another officer said \"What the hell did they do to you?\" \nand got an officer to bring clippers to cut the zipties. The officer told her she had to hold still and \nthen rammed the tool under the plastic tie. The edges of Karenโs vision grew dim and she could \nhear herself scream. Finally, the left cuff popped off, then the right. Karen could breath again. \nThe officer quickly pulled back Karenโs hands and put on more ties. They were still painful, but \nnot excruciating like the last pair. \n                                                           \n103 NRBM, R. Doc. 2-8.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 60 of 83\n228. While waiting for police transport, Karen met Tammy and Alexus. Tammy said \npolice told her she would be charged with abandonment of her son, who would be turned over to \nLouisianaโs Department of Social Services. Karen turned her head to hide the tears she felt \nrolling down her face. \n229. As she talked, Karen noticed the curb felt oddly smooth and cold in the heat. Then \nshe realized she wasnโt feeling the curb at all โ her hand had gone numb. \n230. Karen and thirteen other people were transported to East Baton Rouge Police \nParish in an over-filled van without being seat-belted. Karen thought of Freddie Gray, who died \nin the back of an unpadded police wagon.  \n231. At the jail, she was packed into cells, with up to 24 \npeople in her cell. There was not even enough room for everyone \nto sit down. She was strip searched and exposed to pepper spray. \nKaren noticed that even seventeen-year-old Alexus was strip-\nsearched and required to squat and cough. Only once she was in \n Figure 36: One of Karenโs bloodied knees. \n \njail did Karen notice that her knees were scraped and bleeding.   \n \nWhen one of Karenโs non-protester cellmates found out that Karen was a journalist, she went \nback to her bunk and returned with a piece of paper and a pencil. โWrite,โ she said. โPlease write \nabout us.โ \n232. Karenโs children were frightened. Karenโs daughter Aiesha had been texting with \nher mother when Karen was arrested. She became worried when her mother stopped responding. \nโIโm definitely shaken by this,โ Aiesha said. โI donโt know whatโs going to happen now. I donโt \nknow when sheโs going get out. I donโt know what theyโre going to do to her.โ104 \n                                                           \n104 Daryl Khan, JJIE Reporter Arrested in Baton Rouge While Covering Protest.

Karen was released the next day when her photographer, Marco Poggio, posted \nbond for her.  \n234. A neurologist later confirmed that Karen had suffered nerve damage in her left \nwrist and left hand. \n235. In reporting on the event, she said that the protest that day โmade me wonder what \nhappens in Baton Rouge when the world isnโt watching.โ105 \n236. Cherri Foytlin. Cherri is a journalist and activist from Rayne, Louisiana. On July \n10, 2016, she missed the youth-led march to the state capitol because she was stuck in traffic. \nShe was there to report for the Bridge the Gulf Project. She joined the protesters when they had \nbeen diverted off of Government Street. When police arrived in riot gear, Cherri joined the \nprotesters standing in Ms. Batisteโs yard because โthat's where people would need the most \ndocumentation.\"โ Cherri was in that yard shooting photos when Defendants grabbed a person \nnext to her, pushing her into a fence. Cherri stepped back to avoid getting in the way of the \narrest, and she heard someone say \nheard someone say, โCat, grab her.โ \nCherri was then pushed by a female \nofficer wearing a purple shirt who \nsaid โget back, bitch.โ Cherri \nrecognized her from video as the \nofficer who had been pointing her \nassault rifle at protesters and \nFigure 37: Cherri is told to โget back bitchโ by the the purple-shirted \nofficer who had pointed a gun at protesters and reporters the \nreporters the night before. \nnight before. \n  (Photo by Cherri Foytlin) \n \n                                                           \n \n105 Karen Savage, Reporter Recounts Arrest, Prison Stay After Baton Rouge Protest. Juvenile Justice \n \nInformation Exchange, July 22, 2016. \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 62 of 83\n237. At the order of a male officer, two male officers pushed Cherri to the ground and \npainfully ziptied her hands together. Cherri dropped her phone and an officer took it. The \nofficers who were zip-tying her said \"that phone is gone now!\"  \n238. Once Cherri was zip-tied, the \nfemale officer in the purple shirt came towards her. \nShe told the two officers that she \"want[ed] this \none,\" meaning Cherri. Cherri thought the woman \nwanted revenge for Cherri photographing her \nearlier. Cherri says โ[t]hat's when I knew I was in \ntrouble.โ The purple-shirted officer grabbed Cherri \nand pulled her backwards through the street. Cherri \ntold her, \"I can't walk backwards as fast as you can \nFigure 38: Defendants pull Cherriโs (white shirt) ziptied-\narms up painfully as an officer hands her off to \nwalk forwards.\" She responded, \"you are going to \nthe purple-shirted officer. A witness cries: \nโThatโs a journalist!   \nhave to,\" and sped up. Twice Cherri fell and the \n(Video by Kelly Orians at 3:29.) \n \nofficer kept walking, dragging Cherri until she could get her feet back under her. Cherri told her \n \n \nthat she was with the press and had a press pass in her car. The purple-shirted officer told Cherri \nthat she was not the press and to \"shut the fuck up.\"  \n239. As Cherri is walked to the van, a witness cries โThatโs a journalist! That is a \njournalist! Youโre arresting journalists!โ106 \n240. When Cherri said that the zipties were too tight and hurt her, the purple-shirted \nofficer said โa person can go six hours without circulation to their handsโ and tightened them \neven more. \n241. As they were loading Cherri into the police van, an officer returned her phone. \n                                                           \n106 Video by Kelly Orians at 3:14. This video is incorporated into this complaint.  \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 63 of 83\nCherri told him, โI want you to know I donโt hate you.โ She later described it as a โvery human \nmoment.โ \n242. Cherri had to spend a night in a cold jail cell with no blanket, and was strip-\nsearched twice. Pepper spray was used on her when some protesters sang civil rights songs in \njail.  \n243. Dr. Daniel Liebeskind. In July 2016, Daniel was a obtaining his Doctorate of \nMusical Arts. Prior to July 10, Dr. Liebeskind had never been arrested in his life and the scariest \ninteraction heโd had with a police officer was receiving a ticket for an expired car tag. \n244. On July 10, Dr. Liebeskind complied with the police orders. When the officers \ntold the protesters to move back to the sidewalks and then back further than the sidewalk, Dr. \nLiebeskind complied. Indeed, he went further than compliance โ he told other protesters to โget \noff the sidewalk, get on the grassโ to encourage their compliance too.  \n245. When he heard Defendants announce, โThis is no \nlonger a peaceful protest,โ Dr. Liebeskind was standing on the \ngrass by Lisa Batisteโs porch. He could see lines of officers \nmarching as a unit with shields up, and heard from other protesters \nthat they were approaching from the other direction as well. The \nofficers surrounded him and then charged. Dr. Liebeskind \nFigure 39: A photo taken by Dr. Liebeskind \nmoments before his seizure shows that \nfroze and put his hands into the air. All he knew was that he \nhe was standing well back from the \nstreet and sidewalk.   \ndidnโt want to antagonize the officers.  He was tackled to the   \n \nground by an arresting officer. On the ground, Dr. Liebeskind sa id, โI am not resisting. I am not \nresisting.โ When directed to put his hands behind his back, he tried, telling the officer โIโm \ntrying, sir.โ But he couldnโt because one officer was stepping on his right arm and shoulder, \nimmobilizing it. An officer put a knee into Danielโs back and ziptied his hands. An officer then \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 64 of 83\ntried to pull Danielโs bicycle helmet off his head with brute force, rather than undoing the clasp.* \nOne of the officers kicked Danielโs phone out of his hand, where it was permanently lost.  \n246. While waiting to be transported to the jail, Dr. Liebeskind had another protester \nemail his family with a phone. An officer came over and said a statement similar to: โWhat the \nHELL do you think youโre doing? Put that damn phone away or else I WILL come over there \nand break your face. Iโm a nice guy but you do NOT want to aggravate me!โ  \n247. Later Daniel shared with his friends that: \nBeing  rushed  by  police  in  riot  gear  may  be  the  scariest  thing  Iโve  ever \nexperienced. That experience โ that fear โ had an enormous influence on my \nthinking while in jail. I knew that I *should* go out again to stand up and speak \nout,  but  I  was  afraid.  I  kept  on  thinking  of  the  Kent  State  shootings  and \n[whether I] can help without putting my life at risk. . . .  it was the fear of police \nthat had me telling myself to stay home and not protest in the future. That fear is \nvery real, and for someone like me it is a STRONG deterrent.  \n \n248. Ultimately, Dr. Liebeskind decided to protest again in the future. He said that โI \nwill be back out there non-violently protesting to live in an America where a dead black person \nis NOT presumed guilty until proven innocent.โ As a result of the protest, Dr. Liebeskind had to \nbuy a new phone, new helmet, and new shirt. \n249. Alisha Feldman, Finn Phoenix, and Leah Fishbein. On July 10, 2016, Alisha, \nFinn, and Leah drove from New Orleans to Baton Rouge to join the youth-led march at the \ncapitol building, and then followed the march back to East Blvd. and France Street. They heard \nthe police say โget out of the streetโ and โthis is no longer a peaceful protest.โ So they got out of \nthe street and stood on the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street.  Then they heard \nthe police order protesters to get off of the sidewalk, so they retreated back to Ms. Batisteโs yard. \nIt was there that they were seized by the police.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 65 of 83\n250. Defendants lifted Finn off the ground by their neck, and then put them on the \nground with a knee in the back. Finn couldnโt breathe. \nFinn is a diabetic, and their insulin pump fell out of \ntheir pocket.  It took repeated pleas to get an officer to \nreturn the insulin pump to their pocket. At the prison, \nafter a long time a medic took Finnโs blood sugar and \nsaid they were fine. But Finn received no further care \nfor their diabetes, even though they asked several \ntimes for a snack to help them regulate blood sugar. A \nmedic finally came back and said โwe donโt provide \nFigure 40: Red circle shows Defendants putting \nPlaintiff Finn Phoenix face-down in \nmedical care until you are booked, and you havenโt \nthe street.  \n \nbeen booked yet.โ Finnโs throat was injured so badly that th ey could not swallow solid food. \n \nFinnโs neck and back were so sore that a doctor later diagnosed them with muscle bruising, and \nprescribed a course of muscle relaxers and physical therapy.   \n251. When Leah was seized by Defendants, she told them โIโm not resisting!โ The \nzipties binding her hands were so tight that her hands began to turn purple. At that point, she felt \nlike she was blacking out or disassociating as a result of the pain and fear.  \n252. In the days and weeks subsequent to her arrest, Leah felt very heightened levels of \nanxiety.  She saw a doctor about one week after the arrest for the pelvic injury she sustained, \nduring which her pelvic bone hit the ground so hard when Defendants tackled her that she was \nbruised from mid thigh to mid abdomen. She also saw a podiatrist about a month afterwards for \nfoot pain, because immediately after her arrest she began to suffer from toe and foot pain that \nworsened over time.  Her physical therapist diagnosed her with cervical/lumbar/thoracic spine \ninstability and postural dysfunction, which has resulted in neck pain, hip flexor pain, foot and \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 66 of 83\nback pain. \n253. When Alisha was seized, one Defendant was bending her hands in a way that \ncaused her pain. She cried out, and he bent it harder โ and said โthis wouldnโt happen if you \nwerenโt crying so loud.โ She has been having wrist problems since her arrest.  \n254. Subsequent to their treatment, Finn, Alisha, and Leah attended a group therapy \nsession to relieve their collective trauma/anxiety. \nFigure 41: Original artwork by Alisha Feldman. The image is an excerpt from a piece is entitled \nโNo Cops,โ and shows her arrest with depictions of the law enforcement officers omitted so that \nonly their effects are visible.  (Alisha Feldman, No Cops, August 2016.) \n \n \nThe Municipal Policies and Practices of the City/Parish, the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment and the East Baton Rouge Sheriffโs Office Caused the Violations of Plaintiffsโ \nConstitutional Rights.   \n \n255. The policies and practices of the City/Parish, the BRPD, the East Baton Rouge \nSheriffโs Office, and the other Agency Defendants were a motivating force behind and a \ncontributing cause of the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs suffered.   \n256. Defendants employed well-settled, inter-related de facto and explicit policies and \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 67 of 83\npractices to suppress the Plaintiffsโ exercise of their First Amendment rights and to otherwise \nviolate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, including: \na.  Criminalizing individuals who criticize law enforcement; \nb.  the control and termination of protest and dissent through the targeting for \narrest, detention, abuse, and denigration of perceived protest โleadersโ and, \nin particular, individuals who criticize the police; \nc.  failing to create and implement clear, understandable policies for the benefit \nof sworn police personnel regarding how to respond constitutionally to mass \ndemonstrations and spontaneous protest;  \nd.    failing to train sworn personnel on the importance of protecting and \nrespecting the exercise of First Amendment rights through assembly and \nprotest; \ne.  Directing the creation of pre-printed forms of affidavits of arrest, with facts \nalready pre-written. \nf.  the use of riot gearโi.e., military armamentsโsuch as shields, helmets with \nfacemasks, body armor, batons, rifles, and military vehicles without just \ncause and in order to frighten and intimidate those who wish to peacefully \nassemble to voice their concerns on issue of public importance, thereby \ncreating an atmosphere of tension;   \ng.  failing to discipline sworn personnel who use excessive force, engage in \nracist policing, prepare false reports, falsely arrest citizens, and/or violate \nFirst Amendment rights, thereby creating a culture of impunity in which \nofficers who commit such misconduct learn that they will suffer no adverse \nconsequences; \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 68 of 83\nh.  allowing a widespread practice of excessive force to continue unabated, \ndespite notice of the pattern and the full knowledge of policymakers;  \ni.  failing to create and implement a โstreet closureโ permitting process to \nenable those who wish to engage in demonstrations on matters of immediate \npublic importance to obtain a permit on an emergency basis (i.e., with \nwaiver of the 45 day notice requirement); \nj.  imposing onerous financial conditions on those who seek to engage in \nprotestโi.e., requiring proof of $1 million in liability insurance coverage \nand a receipt for rental of barricades.  \n257. The individual Defendants, including but not limited to the currently unknown \nLaw Enforcement DOES, acting on the instructions and with the approval of Defendants Holden, \nDabadie, Gautreaux, and Edmonson arrested Plaintiffs pursuant to one or more of the policies \nlisted in the preceding paragraph \n258. At all pertinent times herein, Defendants Holden, Dabadie, and Gautreaux were \naware that the policies, procedures, practices, customs, and usages they established for the \nCITY/Parish, BRPD, and EBRSO would result in violations of constitutional rights. These \ndefendants ignored that risk and acted unreasonably, intentionally, and with knowing disregard \nfor Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights as described above. \n259. The policies and practices of the CITY/PARISH, BRPD, and EBRSO listed above \nwere implemented and applied intentionally with knowing disregard for the rights of Plaintiffs. \nThe policies and practices of the CITY/PARISH, BRPD, and EBRSO listed in were \nimplemented by the Defendants, working in concert to suppress the right of community members \nto petition the government for redress of grievances. \n \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 69 of 83\nIV. CAUSES OF ACTION \nOne - Violation of First Amendment Rights to Speech and Assembly \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants)  \n \n260. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n261. In Cox v. Louisiana, 379 US 559 (1965) (โCox IIโ) a group of peaceful civil rights \nprotestors were told by the Baton Rouge Police Chief that they must confine their demonstration \nto โto the west side of the street.\" The protesters complied. Law enforcement then ordered them \nto disperse, saying โ\"Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your \ndemonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of \nthe law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be broken up immediately.\" Law \nenforcement then swept in and arrested Rev. Elton Cox. The Supreme Court held that this \nviolated Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights.  \n262. History repeated itself in 2016. A group of peaceful civil rights protesters were \ntold by Baton Rouge law enforcement that they must move their demonstration out of the streets, \nand then off of the sidewalks. Each time, Plaintiffs complied. Defendants then told them to \ndisperse, declaring that it was โno longer a peaceful protest.โ Defendants then swept in and \narrested Plaintiffs.  \n263. Just as Rev. Coxโs First Amendment rights were violated by Baton Rouge law \nenforcement in 1961, so too were Plaintiffsโ rights violated in 2016.  \n264. The protests in Baton Rouge are subject to heightened protection for the \nadditional reason that they are peaceful and conducted on public streets and sidewalks. \nโConsistent with the traditionally open character of public streets and sidewalks, [the Supreme \nCourt] ha[s] held that the governmentโs ability to restrict speech in such locations is โvery \nlimited.โโ McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2529 (2014). The government is โsharply \ncircumscribedโ in its authority to restrain expressive activity in โplaces which by long tradition \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 70 of 83\nor by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate.โ Perry Educ. Assโn v. Perry \nLocal Educatorsโ Assโn, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Public places, such as streets and sidewalks, \nthat are associated with the free exercise of expressive activities โare considered, without more, \nto be โpublic forums.โโ United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983); see also Snyder, 131 S. \nCt. at 1218 (observing that the Supreme Court has โrepeatedly referred to public streets as the \narchetype of a traditional public forumโ); Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, \n469 (2009) (noting โgovernment entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private \nspeechโ in โsuch โtraditional public foraโโ as public streets and parks); Frisby v. Schultz, 487 \nU.S. 474, 481 (1988) (finding that courts need not make any โparticularized inquiry into the \nprecise nature of a specific streetโ because โall public streets are held in the public trust and are \nproperly considered traditional public foraโ).  Any government act to silence speech may not \nโburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governmentโs legitimate \ninterests.โ Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S 781, 798-99 (1989).  \n265. Plaintiffs, and others like them, have since attempted to engage in peaceful protest \non the streets and sidewalks of Baton Rougeโthe very places which the Supreme Court has \ndescribed as having โimmemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and [which], time \nout of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between \ncitizens, and discussing public questions.โ Hague v. Comm. for Indus. Org., 307 U.S. 496, 515 \n(1939).   \n266. In some of Plaintiffโs arrests, the arresting officers explicitly linked the Plaintiffโs \nexpression to the reason why they were being arrested. For example, just before they arrested \nher, Defendants told Alexus they had seen her โflicking them off.โ  \nTwo - Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Press \n(Plaintiffs Karen Savage and Cherri Foytlin Against All Defendants) \n \n267. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 71 of 83\n268. Defendants violated Karen and Cherriโs rights under the First Amendment to \nfreedom of the press by interfering with their ability to gather information and cover a matter of \npublic interest as members of the media. \n269. When told that Karen was a member of the press and offered credentials, \nDefendant said โfuck you, journalistโ several times.  \n270. Observing and recording public protests, and the police response to those protests, \nis a legitimate means of gathering information for public dissemination that is protected by the \nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press clauses of the First Amendment, as applied to the \nstates under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n271. Defendants engaged in these unlawful actions willfully and knowingly, acting \nwith reckless or deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights. \n272. This was part of a pattern by Defendants. That weekend Defendants arrested Lee \nStranahan,a conservative journalist from the news site Breitbart, a self-professed critic of Black \nLives Matter critic, and a strong supporter of law enforcement. He reported โI did nothing to \nbreak the law. I was not obstructing traffic because with the road closed and police blocking the \nlane, there was no traffic. At no point did I hear the police give any order for me or anyone else \nto stay back. I was given no warning whatsoever; I was simply approached and forced to stop \nrecording.โ107   \n273. Ryan Kailath, an Indian American reporter for a New Orleans NPR affiliate was \narrested while he was on the grass by the highway across from the police station.  Trying to \nmove away from an interaction with the police, he found himself surrounded by police who did \nnot let people leave.  He was charged with simple obstruction of a roadway despite \n                                                           \n107 Bill Quigley, Baton Rouge: โPut Those Damn Weapons Down!โ, Huffingtonpost.com, July 12, \n2016, citing Lee Stranahan, My Weekend Incarceration in a Baton Rouge Prison, Breitbart.com, \nJuly 12, 2016. \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 72 of 83\nhaving camera footage showing he was never in the road.108   \n274. WAFB Assistant News Director Chris Slaughter was arrested when he put one \nfoot on the highway to get a better angle for a video shoot.109  \n275. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants unlawful actions, Plaintiffs were \ndamaged. \n \nFigure 42:   A Defendant ordering Plaintiff and Reporter Karen Savage to stop taking pictures of \n \na group of officers handling a protester.  \n(Photo by Karen Savage.) \n \nThree - First Amendment Retaliation \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n276. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n277. Plaintiffsโ assembly, speech, and newsgathering are protected activities under the \n                                                           \n108 Id., citing Ryan Kailath & Eve Troeh, WWNO Reporter Describes Arrest While Covering Baton \nRouge Protests, WWNO, July 11, 2016. \n \n109 Amy Wold and Maya Lau, Alton Sterling protesters arrested in Baton Rouge to be \nprosecuted?

Defendantsโ arrest, use of force, and searches of Plaintiffs were intended to deter \nand chill their exercise of First Amendment Rights. \n279. For example, it seemed that Nadia and Antonio were targeted because they were \nleading chants.  \n280. As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs were damaged \nand chilled. \nFour - False Arrest and Imprisonment \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n281. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n282. Plaintiffs were arrested without probable cause or due process of law.  \n283. The Affidavits of Probable Cause signed by Defendants were perjured, fabricated, \nboilerplate affidavits that lacked specifics or even basic indicia of truthfulness. Arrest locations \non most were inaccurate by more than five miles.  The arresting officers were not the officers \nwho wrote up the affidavits. \n284. The officers could not have reasonably believed that they had probable cause to \narrest the Plaintiffs for any crime, considering that Plaintiffs had complied with their orders. This \nis especially so considering the United States Supreme Court had issued its rulings in Cox I and \nCox II.  \n285. Furthermore, a necessary element of both 14:97 and 14:100.1 is that the suspect \nactually blocks traffic. This was impossible, as Defendants had blocked off both East Blvd. and \nFrance Street with lines of officers several rows deep. \n \n \n \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 74 of 83\nFigure 43:    Three frames from a video taken by Plaintiff Victor Onuoha show lines of police \n  officers blocking off East Blvd. (left and right) and France St. (middle). The \nirregular shapes are due to the fact that the phone was tilted at an angle. \n \n \n286. Furthermore, no Plaintiff actually resisted arrest. But even if they had, one of the \nelements of RS 14:108 (resisting an officer) is that the underlying arrest must be \"lawful.\" Thus, \nif Plaintiffs werenโt lawfully arrested for violation of 14:97 or 14:100.1, then they couldn't have \nbeen guilty of violating 14:108.  See State v. Ceaser, 859 So. 2d 639, 643 (2003) (\"An individual \nin Louisiana has a time-honored right to resist an illegal arrest.\"). \nFive - Violation of Fourth Amendment Rights to be Free from  \nUnlawful Search and Seizure \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n287. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n288. Plaintiffs have a right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. \n289. Defendants violated these rights when they arrested them, detained them, and \nused force on them without probable cause.  \n290. Defendants engaged in these actions willfully and knowingly, acting with \ndeliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment Rights. \n291. Additionally, when Tammy Cheney returned to her car, she found that Defendants \nhad gone through all the belongings in her car, damaged her trunk, and broken off her side \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 75 of 83\nmirror. This was an illegal search as there was no lawful justification for the search. It was not a \nsearch incident to arrest, because Ms. Cheney was not arrested in her car. It was not a search \nincident to impoundment, because the car was not impounded. It was not a search for evidence \nrelevant to the crime, because Tammy was arrested for Obstruction of a Public Passageway and \nResisting Arrest, two crimes that did not involve anything plausibly in a car.  \n292. Plaintiffsโ phones were searched and their property seized unlawfully.  \nSix - Excessive Force \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n \n293. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n294. The Defendants employed excessive and unreasonable force, or caused excessive \nand unreasonable force to be employed, in effectuating the arrests of Plaintiffs, as specifically \nalleged above, in violation of Plaintiffsโ rights under the Fourth Amendment.  \n295. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \nconstitutional rights. Defendantsโ misconduct was the cause of Plaintiffsโ injuries. \n296. In addition to the actions described above, the use of the acoustic LRAD weapon \non Plaintiffs constituted excessive force. LRAD devices were first developed around 2000, \ninitially for the military as a tool for ships to amplify and project noise to ward off other \nships.  In addition to amplifying sound, LRAD devices can possess a high-pitched, volume \nadjustable \"deterrent tone\" that is marketed to law enforcement as useful for crowd control by \ncreating audible discomfort when used at close range. Close-range exposure to an LRAD can \nresult in migraines, sinus pain, dizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, as \nwell as tinnitus and hearing loss.110  \n                                                           \n110 EDREI v. City of New York, 16-cv-1652 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2017) (Denying motion to dismiss \nregarding LRAD use as excessive force.) \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 76 of 83\n297. For a Model 3300 LRAD, the space within 320 feet of the device is a zone labeled \na \"potential danger area.\"111 Here, Defendants used the LRAD on Plaintiffs at a range of \napproximately 60 to 80 feet.   \n298. The level of sound produced by these devices exceeds both the threshold for \nhuman discomfort (between 85 and 95 dB) and the normal human pain threshold (between 120 \nand 140 dB). \n299. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \nโexposures [greater than] 85 dB may cause hearing loss.โ \n300. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, โany sound over 90 dB can damage a personโs hearing. So the LRAD can threaten the \nhearing of anyone in its path, regardless of whether there is any wrongdoing.โ \nSeven - Failure to Intervene \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants.) \n \n301. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n302. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, \nanguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully \nabove.  \n303. During the events described above, the Defendants stood by without intervening  \nto prevent the violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, even though they had the opportunity and duty to do so.   \n304. The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffsโ clearly established \n                                                           \n111 EDREI v. City of New York, 16-cv-1652 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2017) (Denying motion to dismiss \nregarding LRAD use as excessive force.) \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 77 of 83\nconstitutional rights.  \n305. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ failure to intervene, Plaintiffs \nsuffered damages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, \nloss of liberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above. \nEight - Civil Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Individual Defendants) \n \n306. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n307. Each of the individual Defendants, acting in concert with one another and other \nyet-unknown co-conspirators, conspired by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose \nby unlawful means.  Each of the individual Defendants took concrete steps to enter into an \nagreement in July 2016 to unlawfully detain, arrest, and imprison the Plaintiffs, knowing they \nlacked probable cause to do so, and for the purpose of impeding Plaintiffs from exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to protest by engaging in non-disruptive speech in support of an issue of \npressing public importance.   \n308. In furtherance of this conspiracy, each of the Defendants committed specific overt \nacts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of unlawfully silencing the Plaintiffs. They \naccomplished this goal by using excessive force to unlawfully effect the Plaintiffsโ arrests, \nfabricating evidence against the Plaintiffs, and approving trumped up charges against them, \nwhich resulted in their unlawful imprisonment.  \n309. In the implementation of the conspiracy, the officers, deputies and troopers of \neach of the law enforcement agencies led by Defendants HOLDEN, DABADIE, \nGEAUTREAUX and EDMONSON employed the customs and policies set forth above.  \n310. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ conspiracy, Plaintiffs suffered  \ndamages, including bodily injury, pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of \nliberty, loss of income, and legal expenses, as set forth more fully above.  \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 78 of 83\n311.  Each individual Defendant is therefore liable for the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights \nby any other individual Defendant. \nNine - Monell Claim \n(All Plaintiffs Against Policymaker Defendants) \n \n312. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n313. The misconduct described above was caused by the policies, practices, and \ncustoms of Policymaker Defendants. \n314. The above-described widespread practices, which were so well settled as to \nconstitute the de facto policy of the Defendants, were allowed to exist because policymakers \nwith authority over these acts exhibited deliberate indifference to the problem, thereby \neffectively ratifying it.   \n315. This is clear both from the history of Defendant agencies described above, and \nmore specifically from the >100 wrongful arrests of protesters in the two days prior to Plaintiffโs \narrest. See the list of arrestees attached as Exhibit E. \n316. The policies, practices, and customs set forth above were the driving force behind \nthe numerous constitutional violations in this case that directly and proximately caused Plaintiffs \nto suffer the grievous and permanent injuries and damages set forth above. \n317. Defendants named in this Count, acting individually and together, under color of \nlaw, acted to violate Plaintiffsโ rights as set forth in the preceding claims. Policymaker \nDefendants have developed and maintained policies, practices, procedures, customs, and usages \nexhibiting deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens and residents of the \nCity/Parish, including but not limited to those policies, practices, procedures, customs, and \nusages described above, which caused the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights as described herein and \nthe resultant damages suffered. \n318. Policymaker Defendants had the power to prevent or aid in the prevention of the \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 79 of 83\nwrongs done and conspired to be done as described herein, yet failed or refused to do so, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n319. The actions of the Defendants were the direct and proximate cause of the \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, bodily injury, pain, \nsuffering, mental distress, anguish, humiliation, loss of liberty, loss of income, and legal \nexpenses, as set forth more fully above. \n320. Moreover, the actions of all Defendants were directed, condoned, and/or ratified \nby Policymaker Defendants. \nTen - Violation of the Louisiana Constitution \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n321. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n322. Defendantsโ actions in arresting, detaining, and using force on Plaintiffs as \ndescribed above interfered with their exercise of fundamental rights to speech, assembly and \npress, as guaranteed by Louisianaโs Constitution. It also interfered with their state constitutional \nrights of privacy, freedom from false arrest and unlawful search and seizure.  \nEleven - Intentional and Negligence State Torts - Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent \nInfliction of Emotional Distress, Assault, Battery, False Imprisonment, Malicious \nProsecution, and Negligence \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n323. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n324. Defendantsโ Conduct was extreme and outrageous; knowing that the emotional \ndistress suffered by the Plaintiffs was severe; and Defendants desired or acted with recklessness \nto inflict severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or \nsubstantially certain to result from their conduct. They maliciously commenced criminal \nproceedings against Plaintiffs using perjured and fabricated boilerplate Affidavits of Probable \nCause. They falsely told Tammy Cheney that she would be charged with child endangerment, \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 80 of 83\nand that her children would be taken away.  \n325. Defendants committed intentional offensive contact with Plaintiffs without right, \nand put the Plaintiffs in apprehension of such contact. \n326. They imprisoned and detained Plaintiffs without probable cause or justification, \nand breached their duty of care with regards to Plaintiffs. \n327. Defendantsโ actions were the cause-in-fact of Plaintiffsโ injuries.  \nTwelve- Vicarious Liability \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Supervisor Defendants) \n \n328. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n329. All supervisor Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs for the negligent and intentional \nacts and omissions of those under their direction and control pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code \narticle 2320 and the doctrine of respondeat superior.   \nThirteen - Indemnity \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Agency Defendants) \n \n330. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n331. Louisiana law provides that public entities are directed to pay any tort judgment \nfor compensatory damages for which employees are liable for actions taken in the discharge of \ntheir duties that are within the scope of their employment activities. \n332. While committing the misconduct alleged in the preceding paragraphs, some \nDefendants were employees, members, and agents of agency Defendants within the scope of \ntheir employment. \n333. Agency Defendants are therefore obligated by Louisiana statute to pay any \njudgment entered against their employees. \nFourteen โ Violation of Childrenโs Code Article 306 \n(Plaintiff Alexus Cheney against EBR Sheriff Defendants) \n \n334. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n80 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 81 of 83\n335. Louisiana Children's Code Article 306 directs that generally a child is to be \"held \nin custody in a juvenile detention center.\" But if \"a detention facility for juveniles is not \navailable, he may be held in an adult jail or lockup for identification or processing procedures or \nwhile awaiting transportation only as long as necessary to complete these activities for up to six \nhours.\" (A \"Child\" means a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years. Children's \nCode Art. 116(3). \n336. Here, Alexus Cheney, a seventeen year old girl, was held in an adult, mixed-\ngender detention facility in violation of Article 306. \n337. As a result of her wrongful detention, she was strip-searched, exposed to tear gas, \nand witnessed the tasering of other inmates. She was afraid during the event and traumatized \nafterwards.  \nFifteen - State Law Direct Action Claim \n(Against Defendant Insurance Companies) \n \n338. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in each preceding and following paragraph. \n339. Defendant Insurance Companies, upon information and belief, have issued and/or \ncurrently have in effect one or more policies of insurance covering one or more of the \nDefendants named herein. For valuable consideration received, these policies obligated \nDefendant Insurance Companies, jointly and/or severally, to pay on behalf of their insured \nDefendant(s) any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become obligated to pay to Plaintiffs or to \nindemnify their insured Defendant(s) for any sums the insured Defendant(s) may become \nobligated to pay to Plaintiffs.   \n340. By reason of their illegal and unconstitutional acts, Defendants are liable to \nPlaintiffs for all damages and injuries Plaintiffs has suffered as a result. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant Insurance Companies are contractually obligated to pay these sums on behalf \nof the insured Defendant(s).  \n81 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD   Document 1    07/09/17   Page 82 of 83\n341. Upon information and belief, Defendant Insurance Companies are liable to \nPlaintiffs for any and all damages incurred by reason of the insured Defendant(s)โ acts, up to \ntheir policy  limits, notwithstanding the fact that the insured Defendant(s) may themselves be \nable to assert claims of privilege or immunity from liability.   \n342. Under Louisiana Revised Statute ยง 22:655(B), Plaintiffs bring a direct action \nagainst Defendant Insurance Companies to recover any and all sums they are obligated to pay \nPlaintiffs on behalf of their insureds or to indemnify their insureds. \nVII.    PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter the following relief: \nA. Issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to end their practices and policies as \ndescribed above, as some Plaintiffs wish to participate in future protests in Baton Rouge;  \nB. Issue a preliminary injunction to (1) require Defendants to obtain the expungement of \nPlaintiffsโ arrests at Defendantsโ cost; (2) bar Defendants from reporting Plaintiffโs arrests to any \nlaw enforcement agency, database, employer, or credit agency; (3) end their practices and \npolicies as described above; \nC. Issue a permanent injunction for the above; \nD. Enter a declaratory judgment, specifying Defendantsโ constitutional and statutory \nviolations and declaring the rights of the Plaintiffs; \nE. Award nominal damages;  \nF. Award special damages; \nG. Award compensatory damages; \nH. Award Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneysโ fees incurred in this action, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205, 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.175, and 29 U.S.C. ยง 794a(b); \nI.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nBLAIR IMANI, ET AL.    \n  CIVIL ACTION \nVERSUS   \n  NO. 17-439-JWD-EWD \nCITY OF BATON ROUGE, ET AL. \n \nORDER \n \n  This matter comes before the Court on the Motion to Dismiss and in the Alternative Motion \nto Strike (Doc. 96) by Sheriff Sid Gautreaux and AIX Group, d/b/a Nova Casualty Company \n(โEBRSO Defendantsโ).  Plaintiffs oppose the motion (Doc. 104), and EBRSO Defendants have \nfiled a reply (Doc. 116).  Oral argument was heard today.  The Court has carefully considered the \nlaw, the facts in the record, and the arguments and submissions of the party and is prepared to rule.  \nFor oral reasons to be assigned, \nIT IS ORDERED that EBRSO Defendantsโ motion is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED \nIN PART, and DEFERRED IN PART. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that EBRSO Defendantsโ motion to strike is GRANTED \nIN PART and DENIED IN PART to the same extent as the LSP and City/Parish Defendantsโ \nmotions to strike (Docs. 64, 68).  Further, EBRSO Defendantsโ motion to strike the operative \ncomplaint as an improper shotgun pleading is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the claims asserted against Sheriff Gautreaux in his \nindividual capacity are DISMISSED IN PART.  Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege \npersonal  participation  by  Gautreaux  in  the  underlying  constitutional  violations.    However, \nPlaintiffs have alleged that Gautreaux made a single policy decision which may have been the \nmoving force of a constitutional decision.  Accordingly, the Court will DEFER ruling on this issue \n\nuntil limited written discovery is conducted on the narrow issue of whether any EBRSO deputy \nwas involved in the constitutional violations.  The Magistrate Judge will determine what limited \ndiscovery will be allowed for this issue.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, with respect to the claims against Sheriff Gautreaux \nin his official capacity, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DEFERRED IN PART.  The \nmotion is GRANTED in that (a) Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead a claim for a custom of \nunlawful arrest and excessive force, for lack of prior incidents in sufficient number and kind; and \n(b) Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for failure to train, supervise, and implement a policy, as \nPlaintiffs have failed to adequately plead deliberate indifference through either a pattern of similar \nincidents or the narrow single incident exception.  The motion is DEFERRED in that, while \nPlaintiffs have adequately pled a single policy decision that may have been the moving force of \nconstitutional violations and that was made with deliberate indifference, limited discovery is \nneeded to determine if Plaintiffs can plead an underlying constitutional violation by an EBRSO \ndeputy, as outlined above. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, with respect to the claims for a conspiracy under \nยง 1983, ยง 1985(3), and state law, the motion is GRANTED.  With respect to ยง 1985(3), while \nPlaintiffs have adequately pled most of the elements of the claim, Plaintiffs have failed to \nadequately allege an agreement.  Specifically, Plaintiffs provide no information on where the \nagreement was formed, and they give only few details on the circumstances surrounding the \nagreement.  For the same reason, Plaintiffs fail to state a ยง 1983 and state law conspiracy claim.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, with respect to the state law claims (both those \ninvolving Gautreauxโs individual liability and vicarious liability), the motion is DEFERRED \npending the limited discovery outlined above. \n2 \n \n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the same extent Plaintiffsโ claims were dismissed \nagainst the EBRSO Defendants, Plaintiffsโ claims against Nova are also dismissed.  Qualified \nimmunity is not a โpersonal,โ procedural defense within the meaning of Louisiana law but rather \na substantive defense that depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent the motion is granted, Plaintiffs are given \nleave to amend their complaint to cure the deficiencies. Plaintiffs must file their next amended \ncomplaint within thirty (30) days of the completion of the limited discovery set forth above.   \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 7, 2018. \n \n \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n3 \n ",

Introduction \n  This matter comes before the Court on two dispositive motions.  The first is the Motion for \nSummary  Judgment  (Doc.  307)  filed  by  the  defendants  associated  with  the  City  of  Baton \nRouge/Parish of East Baton Rouge (the โCityโ) (collectively, โDefendantsโ).1  This motion is \nopposed by all Plaintiffs.2 (Doc. 309.)  No reply was filed. The second motion is Plaintiffsโ Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 297) filed by all Plaintiffs as to their First Amendment claims \nand by eight Plaintiffs3 as to their claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and manufacturing of \nfalse evidence, (Doc. 297-1 at 3โ4).  This motion is opposed by Defendants, (Doc. 310), and \nPlaintiffs have filed a reply, (Doc. 323). Oral argument is not necessary.  The Court has carefully \n \n1 Defendants include: the City, former Mayor-President Melvin Lee โKipโ Holden, and ex-Baton Rouge City Police \nChief, Carl Dabadie, Jr., in his individual capacity, Baton Rouge City Chief of Police in his official capacity \n(previously Carl Dabadie, Jr., currently Murphy Paul), former Interim Chief Jonny Dunnam, and BRPD officers \nJonathon Abadie, William Alexander, Alex Bell, Brandon Blust, Kenny Brewer, James Crockett, Myron Daniels, \nJason Dohm, Taylor Giroir, Kirk Grover (incorrectly named โKirk Gloverโ), Alan Hamilton, Darren Hunt, Earnest \nJones, Earl Lapeyrouse, Alaina Mancuso, Richard McCloskey, Travis Norman, Jeff Pittman, Reab Simoneaux, Jr., \nChristopher Bryan Taylor, James Thomas, Billy Walker, Mike Walker, David Wallace, Randall Wiedeman, Derrick \nWilliams, Willie Williams, Keith Wilson, and Curtis Wilson. \n2 The remaining Plaintiffs include Blair Imani, Akeem Muhammad, Raae Pollard, Samantha Nichols, Alexus Cheney, \nVictor Onuoha, Karen Savage, Cherri Foytlin, Alisha Feldman, Antonio Castanon Luna, Nadia Salazar Sandi, Dr. \nDaniel Liebeskind, Finn Phoenix (C. Gaffney), and Leah Fishbein. \n3 Specifically, Blair Imani seeks partial summary judgment for these discrete claims against William Alexander, \nAkeem Muhammad  against Travis Norman, Samantha Nichols against Jonathan Abadie, Victor Onuoha against \nWillie Williams, Cherri Foytlin against Derrick Williams, and Dr. Daniel Liebeskind against Alex Bell. (Id.) Each of \nthese Plaintiffs, along with Alexus Cheney and Raee Pollard, also seek partial summary judgment against the City on \nthese claims. (Id.) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 2 of 110\nconsidered the law, the facts in the extensive record, and the arguments and submissions of the \nparties and is prepared to rule. \n  In 1965, the Supreme  Court decided two companion cases arising from civil rights \ndemonstrations in Baton Rouge protesting racial segregation and discrimination: Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 U.S. 536 (1965) (โCox Iโ) and Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559 (1965) (โCox IIโ).  At the \nconclusion of the second, the Supreme Court summarized the tensions between freedom and order \nbut concluded that the two were, in our system, inseparable: \nLiberty can only be exercised in a system of law which safeguards \norder. We reaffirm the repeated holdings of this Court that our \nconstitutional command of free speech and assembly is basic and \nfundamental and encompasses peaceful social protest, so important \nto  the  preservation  of  the  freedoms  treasured  in  a  democratic \nsociety. We also reaffirm the repeated decisions of this Court that \nthere is no place for violence in a democratic society dedicated to \nliberty under law, and that the right of peaceful protest does not \nmean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may do so at \nany time and at any place. There is a proper time and place for even \nthe most peaceful protest and a plain duty and responsibility on the \npart of all citizens to obey all valid laws and regulations. There is an \nequally plain requirement for laws and regulations to be drawn so as \nto give citizens fair warning as to what is illegal; for regulation of \nconduct that involves freedom of speech and assembly not to be so \nbroad in scope as to stifle First Amendment freedoms, which need \nbreathing  space  to  survive;  for  appropriate  limitations  on  the \ndiscretion  of  public  officials  where  speech  and  assembly  are \nintertwined  with  regulated  conduct;  and  for  all  such  laws  and \nregulations to be applied with an equal hand. We believe that all of \nthese requirements can be met in an ordered society dedicated to \nliberty.  We  reaffirm  our  conviction  that  freedom  and  viable \ngovernment are . . . indivisible concepts. \n \nCox II, 379 U.S. at 574โ75 (cleaned up).  Now, over half a century later, this Court is asked to \nagain balance these sometimes competing interests in another protester case involving racial \ndivisions in the city of Baton Rouge.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 3 of 110\nSpecifically, in July 2016, Plaintiffs were protesting the killing of Alton Sterling by police \nofficers and their desire for change in the Baton Rouge Police Department (โBRPDโ).  They \nmarched downtown and were eventually led to the corner of East Boulevard and France Street.  \nMany of the protesters gathered on private property.  The police surrounded them on three sides.  \nAn hour passed.  Officers then moved in to make mass arrests.  These Plaintiffs are some of those \napprehended demonstrators. \nThe parties present radically different versions of events.  On the one hand, Defendants \nsubmit evidence that some protesters intended to block the interstate.  Defendants also show proof \nthat the crowd was unruly and were given several orders to disperse throughout the standoff yet \nfailed to do so.  Defendants refer to other parts of the record, including videos and photographs, \nreflecting that Plaintiffs were in the street in violation of the law.  According to Defendants, both \nthe officers and the community were in danger. \nConversely, Plaintiffs provide testimony, including that of experts, indicating that the \nprotesters were largely peaceful.  Plaintiffs point to the Cityโs own admissions that no Plaintiff \nwas violent and that no Plaintiff failed to comply with orders.  Plaintiffs also highlighted the \nmilitarized response  and overwhelming force  of the police in contrast to the unarmed and \nsubmissive demonstrators.  According to Plaintiffs, there was no danger, except for civil rights \nviolations at the hands of Defendants. \nGiven the conflicting evidence on many critical issues in this case, and given the differing \nreasonable conclusions that can be drawn from even undisputed facts in the record, the Court finds \nthat genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in favor of either party on nearly \nevery one of Plaintiffsโ claims.  This case will largely be decided by a jury drawn from the \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 4 of 110\ncommunity.  And given the fundamental policies implicated by this caseโliberty and orderโthe \nCourt believes this is the best possible outcome. \nII.  Relevant Factual Background \nA.  Events Leading up to East and France \n1. Beginning of the Protest at Issue \nOn July 5, 2016, Baton Rouge police officers shot Alton Sterling to death.  (Def.โs Resp. \nPls.โ Statement of Material Facts in Supp. Mot. Partial. S.J. (โDRPSMFโ) ยถ 1, Doc. 311 at 1.)4 \nThroughout the following week, a series of large protests took place about Sterlingโs killing. (Rule \n30(b)(6) Dep. 109:21โ110:1, Doc. 292-3.) \nOn Sunday, July 10, 2016, there was a scheduled march and protest in downtown Baton \nRouge. (Pl.โs Resp. Defs.โ Statement Material Facts (โPRDSMFโ) ยถ 2, Doc. 309-1 at 1.)5  There \nwas no permit, but the organizers contacted the BRPD, which treated the event as though it had a \npermit, assisting with street closures and security. (Id.)  That march went from Wesley United \nMethodist Church, 544 Government Street (between Napoleon Street and St. Charles Street), to \nthe State Capitol, and returned to the church. (Id.)  \nBoth sides agree that, on return, the protesters divided. (See id. ยถ 3.)  Many protesters got \ninto their vehicles and departed the area. (Id.)  Others advanced east down Government Street. \n(Id.)   \n2. Arrival at East and France \nThe protesters were redirected off of Government Street, which they had been marching \ndown, and gathered in the intersection of East Boulevard and France Street, within a city block or \n \n4 When the DRPSMF is cited by paragraph number to support a particular fact, that fact is undisputed for purposes of \nthis motion. See M.D. La. LR 56(c), (g). \n5 Likewise, when the PRDSMF is cited by paragraph number to support a particular fact, that fact is undisputed at this \ntime. See M.D. La. LR 56(c), (g). \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 5 of 110\ntwo of two separate entrances to I-110. (PRDSMF ยถ 9, Doc. 309-1 at 2.)  BRPD had to block traffic \nin order to keep the protesters from being hit by cars. (PRDSMF ยถ 9, Doc. 309-1 at 2โ3.)   \nProtesters were told to go โtoward East Boulevard and France Street, to clear a major \nthoroughfare for downtown.โ (DRPSMF ยถ 2, Doc. 311 at 1.)  BPRD argues that it did this because \nof fear the protesters would enter the interstate, as will be explored below. (Doc. 311 at 1.)  \nElements from BRPD, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sherriffโs Office, Louisiana State Police, and \nthe Calcasieu Parish Sherriffโs Office responded. (PRDSMF ยถ 10, Doc. 309-1 at 3.)  BRPD brought \nin these re-enforcements and other agencies as well as โthe equipment that the officers [were] \nwearingโ and โthe footprint of the eventโ โbecause of the taxing environment, the heat, to mitigate \nthis.โ (David Wallace Dep. 123:2โ10, Doc. 292-29.) \nBRPD sent out people for the protests to photograph and video โagitators, the ones that \nwere being loud or trying to get the crowds to follow them, and then any kind of action that [BRPD] \n[was] taking [(such as an arrest)] to try to catch that on video.โ (Keith Wilson Dep. 26:3โ26:4, \nDoc. 298โ24.)  The crowd was estimated by some to be made up of hundreds of protesters. \n(PRDSMF ยถ 11, Doc. 309-1 at 3; see also Myron Daniels Dep. 177:8โ15, Doc. 292-22.)  The \nphotos reflect many people gathered there. (See Photos ALK 1928, 1929, 1930; MES 14, 15, 16, \n17; MGK 16, 17, 18.)  \nB.  Events at East and France \n1. Before the Arrests \na.  The Protest in Limbo  \nBoth sides agree that, over the course of approximately ninety minutes at East and France, \nadditional police elements arrived and formed lines comprised of Mobile Field Force teams, \nSWAT, arrest teams, uniformed officers, and Crime Scene officers, forming a three-sided box. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 6 of 110\n(PRDSMF ยถ 16, Doc. 309-1.) Those lines were at the south end of East Boulevard facing north, \nthe north end of East Boulevard facing south, and one line on the east side of East Boulevard facing \nwest. (Id.)  Plaintiffs provide the following diagram: \n \n \n(See Curtis Wilson Dep. 21:22โ22:7, Doc. 292-11 (confirming accuracy of diagram).)  Some \nprotesters were standing in the yard of Ms. Batiste, and the City had no reason to think that these \nprotesters did not have permission to be there. (See id.; Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 186:12โ187:1, Doc. \n292-25.) \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 7 of 110\nb.  BRPDโs Concerns about the Interstate \n  Initially, a BRPD officer spoke to a single protester (purportedly the leader of the group), \nand that demonstrator said that they were going to enter and block Interstate I-110. (PRDSMF ยถ 4, \nDoc. 309-1 at 1; David Wallace Dep. 102:17โ103:21, Doc. 292-29.)  Corporal Alaina Mancuso \narrived later and spoke to a protester who confirmed her intention to block the freeway. (PRDSMF \nยถ 5, Doc. 309-1 at 1.) \nLater, an undercover officer reported back to his superiors that some of the protesters in \nthe East and France group had expressed an intent to go onto the interstate. (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) \nDep. 171:2โ23, Doc. 298-7.)  The City testified: \nQ.  Is it the Cityโs position that the officers on the scene had a \nreasonable belief that if they had allowed these protesters to stay the \ncorner of France, that they would eventually enter the interstate? \n \nA.  It was a known fact, because communication with protesters \n- - because the intelligence officer in the crowd, we knew exactly \nwhat their intentions were.  So yes, sir, it was a fact. \n \n(Id. at 160:10โ19; see also David Wallace Dep. 102:2โ16, Doc. 288-4 (โKnowing the location of \nthe interstate, all of those elements and bread-crumbs led us to believe that they were trying to get \nto the interstate to shut it down. . . .โ).) \nBut even this evidence is conflicting.  The undercover officer who reported the intelligence \nhad not surveyed the whole group, and the City conceded that it was โunclear . . . if that reflected \nthe intentions of the entire group.โ (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 172:19โ23, Doc. 298-7.)  Further, \nwhen asked โwhether it was two, three, four or more people talking aboutโ entering the highway, \nthe City said on the one hand that โ[i]t was a pretty big consensus from our officer relaying the \ninformation on what the group was doing,โ but on the other hand that he could not โput a number \non whoโ and that he would not โsay every single person knew exactly what they were doing, \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 8 of 110\nbecause they might have just been just following them. . . . It sounds like impossible to answer.โ \n(Id. at 225:18โ226:8.)  \nEvidence is also conflicting as to the instructions given by the police to the protesters about \nentering the freeway.  The Cityโs representative testified that the protesters were initially told \ndirectly by an officer that they would be allowed to enter the interstate highway. (Rule 30(b)(6) \nDep. 191:11โ192:8, Doc. 292-25.)  That policeman (Brandon Smith) advised the leader, โWell, \nhold on.  We figured yโall would.  Itโs dangerous.โ (David Wallace Dep. 104:2โ16, Doc. 292-29).  \nโSo, they gave them some stall tactics to where [the police] could get the resources there to mitigate \nit.โ (Id.)  But a different officer, Alaina Mancuso, told another protester that she could not get on \nthe interstate and that, if she did, she would be arrested. (Alaina Mancuso Dep. 28:5โ29:6, Doc. \n292-20.) \nIn any event, the City also based its belief about the demonstratorsโ intent on other protests \noccurring around the same time in other cities (many on that day) and the fact that โit was a \ncommon practice for protesters to . . . gain attentionโ in this way. (Id. at 267:1โ268:17; see also \nid. at 264:10โ266:25; Def. Ex. EEEEEE -Hundreds arrested BLM MSNBC (showing a news story \ncontaining clips of protesters on various interstates); David Wallace Dep. 102:2โ16, Doc. 292-29 \n(saying the Cityโs intelligence was โconsistent with what protesters have done around the nation \nprior to this eventโ).)   Indeed, a video from the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange produced \nafter the events of the day (and discussed below) also reflects the intent of some protesters to block \nthe interstate.  (See Def. Ex. HHHHHH -Juvenile Justice Information Exchange, at 2:05.)  \n  Defendants submit evidence that the protestersโ desire to block the interstate โwould be a \ndanger both to protesters and for other members of the public.โ (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 159:8โ\n8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 9 of 110\n160:1, Doc. 298-7.)  โItโs extremely dangerous, especially in that location.  The traffic speeds and \nitโs sort of a blind curve in the interstate there.  It would have been disastrous.โ (Id.)   \nUltimately, the protesters never made it to the interstate that day. (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n164:9โ12, Doc. 292-25.)  But the alleged  โprimary concernโ for the City and the purported โbasis \nfor the arrests of protesters at East and France was the possibility that they might have continued \non to the interstate.โ (Id. at 164:13โ18.) \nc.  Danger to the Officers \n \nAs will be explained below, the parties hotly dispute the extent to which the officers and \ncommunity were in danger during this period.  Plaintiffs highlight that the police had a Bearcat, \nwhich was an armored vehicle. (PRDSMF ยถ 15, Doc. 309-1.)  Further, BRPD had also borrowed \na LRAD (Long Range Acoustical Device), which was basically a loud speaker designed to make \npeople so uncomfortable as to leave. (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 132:18โ133:19, 134:14โ17, Doc. 292-\n25.)  This device was used on the top of the Bearcat, (id.), though the parties point to different \ntestimony about whether the device was effective, (compare id. at 140:24โ142:14, with id. at \n138:2โ7, 142:15โ21.)  Finally, Plaintiffs dispute Defendantsโ characterization of themselves as \nโvulnerableโ given Defendantsโ body armor, armored vehicle, LRAD, pistols, patrol rifles, ability \nto deploy tear gas, undercover operatives, helicopter, and โfixed wing airplaneโ used to provide \noverhead footage. (See Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 120:1โ5, 126:11โ127:2,  128:10โ17, 214:8โ10, 215:20โ\n21, 222:6โ8, Doc. 292-25.)   \n  Defendants, on the other hand, say they were waiting for support to arrive before making \ntheir move. (See Thomas Morse Dep. 42:4โ20, Doc. 298-16.)  One officer also testified that โ[the \nofficers] started receiving the attacks with the items that were thrown at [them] from that area.  At \nthat point, it was not lawful.โ (Myron Daniels Dep. 105:16โ106:5, Doc. 292-22; see id. at 110:15โ\n9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 10 of 110\n22 (saying that objects were being thrown from the private property).)  That policeman estimated \nit was โquite a few people or it was more than five.โ (Id. at 178:17โ19.)  Another officer testified \nthat the protest was not peaceful because โ[t]here had been a lot of things thrown from the crowd \nat officers,โ along with โthings that [were] being yelled and . . . the general atmosphere of the \nprotesters.โ (Thomas Morse Dep. 51:17โ52:3, Doc. 298-16.)  Defendants lastly present videos of \nat  least  two  water  battles  being  thrown  at  the  officers.  (Def.  Ex.  DDDDD  -  From  Finn  - \nVID_20160710_193234661, at 00:10-00:12; Def. Ex. DDDDDDD - Blaze Opposite view of arrest \n(Antonio & Nadia), at 00:18-00:25.) \nd.  Orders to Disperse \nFurther, the parties disagree as to when and how often the order was given for the protesters \nto disperse.  Defendants testified that commands to disperse were given throughout this period. \n(see, e.g., Thomas Morse Dep. 29:20โ23, Doc. 298-16 (โI just said to again tell them to disperse, \nthat sort of thing, basically just giving them lots and lots and lots of opportunity and time to leave \nthe areaโ); id. at 35:8โ36:15 (โI made that statement (โWhere youโre standing isnโt good enoughโ) \nnumerous times before the 26-minute mark, you know, that hey, you need to leave here.  If - - you \nknow, youโll be placed under arrest if you donโt leave.  I mean, this went on for hours, like, more \nthan a hour.โ); James Thomas Dep. 78:21โ79:7, Doc. 298-19 (โI remember giving - - me and \nmultiple other officers giving loud verbal commands to get out of the roadway.โ).)  Indeed, \nSergeant Morse testified: \nAs  far  as  communication,  numerous,  numerous  countless,  you \nknow, announcements made over the PA. I can't even tell you how \nmany times I was told, hey, tell them one more time they need to \nleave. Tell them one more time that they -- I mean, over and over \nand over and over and over again communicating the intentions, \nlike, hey, you need to leave; we're giving you the chance to leave or \nyou're going to be arrested. You need to leave now or you're going \nto be arrested. You need to leave now or you're going to be arrested. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 11 of 110\nSo, I mean, as far as communication, I guess there was no, like, \ndialogue as much as of orders being given because there's really no \nway in that circumstance when you have several hundred people, the \nprotestors out there outnumbering the police that were out there, I \ndon't know of a way where you could have an one-on-one dialogue. \n. . . It's more of an announcement of hey, you need to leave. . . . \n[T]here was no one-on-one dialogue going on[.] \n \n(Thomas Morse Dep. 112:2โ113:7, Doc. 298-16.) \n  Defendants also provide videos in which the officers asked the protesters to disperse. (See \nDef. Ex. SS KMW8273 07-10-16(4), at 00:35-0043, โPlease disperse. Please leave the area, or you \nwill be arre . . .โ (Audio cut short), time stamp shows July 10, 2016, 5:55 p.m.; ALK East Blvd. \nDSC_1918, at 00:55-01:15, โYou are ordered to disperse or you will be arrested. Everyone in the \narea . . . will be arrestedโ, time stamp shows July 10, 2016, 5:16 p.m.) \nBut Plaintiffs highlight that, according to the Cityโs deposition, โthere was about an hourโs \nworth of time when protesters were gathered on the property at 602 East Boulevard where they \nwere just standing on the property[.]โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 190:16โ23, Doc. 292-25.)  Plaintiffs \nalso refer to the Affidavits of Probable Cause, which say that Plaintiffs were advised by loud \nspeaker to remain on private property and the curbโa fact which Defendants admit but say is \nincomplete, as it does not refer to the orders to disperse. (DRPSMF ยถ 3, Doc. 311.)  Further, \nPlaintiffs submit photographs showing that they were among the ones on the curb and private \nproperty. (See Figs. 1 & 2, Doc. 297-1 at 7.) \nAfter that, even though one officer said the streets were cleared, (John Clary Dep. 90:2โ9, \nDoc. 292-19), BRPD declared, โWhere you are standing is not good enough.โ (Myron Daniels \nDep. 120:8โ10, Doc. 292-22; see also John Clary Dep. 91:7โ12, Doc. 292-19 (โQ. So you heard \nthe leave now, leave now. Where you are standing is not good enough? A. Yes, sir. Q. So is that \nthe dispersal order that you described? A. Yes, sir. . . . โ).)  Plaintiffs submit proof from the Cityโs \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 12 of 110\n30(b)(6) representative that this order should not have issued if the streets were clear. (Rule \n30(b)(6) Dep. 33:23โ34:3, Doc. 292-25 (โQ. Right. So if people haven't cleared the streets, Baton \nRouge Police Department could say: โThat's not good enough.โ But if they have moved back on to \n-- and cleared the streets, Baton Rouge Police Department should not say: โThat's not good \nenough.โ Agreed? A. Agreed.โ).)  Further, according to the City, โany protesters who complies \nwith an order to clear the streets should not be arrested by Baton Rouge Police Department.โ \n(DRPSMF  ยถ 4, Doc. 311 at 1.)  โ[I]f protesters clear the streets after being given a command to \nclear the streets, there's not the justification to sweep in and make arrests.โ (Id. ยถ 5.)   \n2. The Arrests  \na.  Generally \nThe police elements moved slowly, advancing on the yard of 602 East Boulevard and \nFrance Street west of East Boulevard, where many protesters had gathered. (PRDSMF ยถ 18, Doc. \n309-1.)  Even as arrests were made in the yard and street, many protesters fled and were not \narrested. (Id.) \nThe parties submit dueling charts on the issue of arrest.  Plaintiffsโ chart, supported by the \nRule 30(b)(6) deposition, reflects that the City has no evidence Plaintiffs did not comply with \norders or that any Plaintiff engaged in an act of violence. (Rule 30(b)(6) Chart, Doc. 292-1 at 1; \nRule 30(b)(6) Dep. 26:19โ27:8, Doc. 292-2 (โQ. So then, going to our chart, the first column is \nโDoes the City have evidence plaintiff didn't comply with orders,โ . . . We can truthfully put a โnoโ \nin each of the boxes in this column. Agreed? A. Yes.โ); id. at 36:21โ37:4 (โQ. . . . So, just to be \nclear, you don't see any discrepancies on page one of this chart that are discrepancies from the \ntestimony of the City of Baton Rouge. Agreed? A. . . . I don't see anything on this chart that's a \ndiscrepancy from what I testified for the City on this script.โ).)  It is also undisputed that the Cityโs \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 13 of 110\nrepresentative said that โother than the affidavit of probable cause, the City does not have any \ndescription of any specific plaintiff's illegal activity.โ (DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. 311.)   \nMoreover, the chart also shows that, with a few exceptions, the City had no knowledge of \nwhich officer saw which Plaintiff commit any crime. (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 42:21โ43:18, Doc. 292-\n2 (stating that Castanon, Salazar, Feldman, and Fishbein are โthe only plaintiffs that . . . the City \nhas any knowledge of which officers allegedly saw and reported each plaintiff committing a crime. \nCorrect? A. That is correct. Q. So, for the remainder of this column I've put in unknown. Would \nthat be accurate? A. Correct.โ).)  Moreover, the City also lacked any knowledge of what officer \nseized which Plaintiff.  (Id. at 45:4โ9 (โQ. So this column here, which officers laid hands on \nplaintiff on page two of Imani plaintiff chart, I filled in [Castanon and Savage] and put unknown \nfor the rest. Is that an accurate reflection of the City's testimony? A. Correct.โ).) \nPlaintiffs also submit testimony that the โvast majority of people were on private propertyโ \nand โoutside of the public passages[.]โ (Myron Daniels Dep. 122:9โ19, Doc. 292-22.)  โ[T]he \nwhole yard was cleared of protesters . . . [e]ventually,โ (David Wallace Dep. 90:4โ7, Doc. 292-\n29), even though the City had no reason to think that the protesters standing on the private property \nat East and France did not have permission to be there, (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 186:12โ187:1, Doc. \n292-25).  According to one legal observer for the ACLU, even โ[p]rotestors who wanted to leave \nwere not able to do soโ because the โpolice were blocking all surrounding intersections and there \nwas nowhere for people to go.โ (North Baton Rouge Matters v. City of Baton Rouge, No. 16-463-\nJWD-RLB, Lily Ann Ritter Aff., Doc. 2-9 at 13.) \nDefendants, on the other hand, submits a chart cataloging many of the videos with \ntimestamps showing various Plaintiffs in the roadway or on the sidewalk. (Def. Ex. 1 โ Chart of \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 14 of 110\nphotos and videos (โDefs.โ Chartโ), Doc. 310-1.) Defendants rely on this exhibit as evidence that \nPlaintiffs failed to comply and that the arrests were justified. (Id.)   \nDefendants also point to the Cityโs representativeโs testimony that, if orders to disperse \nwere given and ignored, that would be evidence of noncompliance. (See Doc. 311 at 2 (citing Rule \n30(b)(6) 50:7โ52:16, Doc. 292-2).)  The Cityโs deponent further stated: \nThe problem the guys faced on France Street was -- the crowd -- \nwell, first off, it started as a peaceful march. It was un-permitted. It \nwas led by our traffic division and went to the state capitol and back \nto a local resident, a local church. And then the crowd or certain \nmembers of the crowd decided they wanted to overtake the interstate \nsystem. They failed to disperse after given orders. There was limited \nmanpower there to make arrests. Once the manpower got there, the \narrests began to be made. It looks like protesters were just hanging \nout at some unknown person's house with permission, but that wasn't \nthe case at all. They committed the crime. And once the resources \ngot there to make arrests, arrests were made. \n \n(Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 154:6โ22, Doc. 298-7.) \nb.  Details of Specific Arrests \nPlaintiffs  Blair  Imani,  Akeem  Muhammad,  Raae  Pollard,  Samantha  Nichols,  Victor \nOnuoha, Alisha Feldman, Daniel Liebeskind, Finn Phoenix, and Leah Fishbein were arrested in \nthe yard of 602 France Street in the initial push into the yard. (PRDSMF ยถ 19, Doc. 309-1.)  \nPhotographs and video show Blair Imani, Akeem Muhammad, Raae Pollard, and Samantha \nNichols at multiple locations throughout the protest, in the roadway and on sidewalks at various \npoints in time. (Id.) \nPlaintiff Cherri Foytlin was arrested on France Street at about the same time as the push \ninto the yard. (Id. ยถ 20.)  Photographs and video show Cherri Foytlin at multiple locations \nthroughout the protest, in the roadway and on sidewalks at various points in time. (Id.) \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 15 of 110\nSome protesters who appeared to be inciting the crowd or otherwise agitating the crowd \nwere arrested within a few blocks, and a few minutes after the push into the yard. (Id. ยถ 21.)  This \nfact is undisputed, but Plaintiffs emphasize BRPDโs potentially unconstitutional definition of \nโagitatorโ which will be discussed below. (See id.) \nAs to Plaintiff Alexus Chaney, Earl Lapeyrouse of the BRPD testified that he remembered \nher because on the day in question โshe was on the scene and was out in the roadwayโ. (E.J. \nLapeyrous Dep. 40:7โ41:15, Doc. 298-15.)  Lapeyrouse remembered she was in the roadway in \nFrance Street, but he did not remember at what point in the protest that happened. (Id. at 42:10โ\n24.)   Lapeyrouse also stated that she and her mother left a child in the car on Government Street \nwhile Alexus was protesting and while the mother was somewhere else and that Child Protection \nwas called to get the baby after their arrest. (Id. at 43:5โ46:5.)  Plaintiffs respond by saying that \nAlexus Cheney was not blocking the roadway, and, even if she was standing in the roadway at one \npoint, the diagram above shows that it was impossible for her to block the roadway when officers \nhad walled off the street on three sides.   \nAs to Plaintiff Karen Savage, James Thomas testified that she was in the roadway, and she \nโran off . . . trying to get away, and thatโs whenever [he] went to assist with . . . placing her into \nhandcuffsโ at a McDonalds, which is two blocks from East and France. (James Thomas Dep. 81:8โ\n82:16, Doc. 298-19.)  Thomas said he and other officers gave โloud verbal commands to get out \nof the roadway,โ and โ[s]he refused to multiple times[.]โ (Id. at 78:18โ25.) Thomas also stated she \nresisted arrest, which made it harder to place handcuffs on her, though she finally complied. (Id. \nat 79:1โ5.)   \nWith respect to Plaintiff Savage, Plaintiffs provide no evidence in the PRDSMF to rebut \nthis, except to say that Thomasโ testimony is โnot even internally consistentโ; Savage purportedly \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 16 of 110\nโignoredโ orders to disperse while at the same time having left the intersection of East and France \nand moved several blocks away. (Doc. 309-1 at 6.) \nPlaintiffs Antonio Castanon Luna and Nadia Salazar Sandi were arrested on the north side \nof Government Street at Maximillian. (PRDSMF ยถ 24, Doc. 309-1 at 6.) They had been at the \nintersection of East Boulevard and France Street, and they appeared to be โincitingโ the crowd. \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs do not dispute this fact, except to say that โincitingโ has the same definition of \nโagitating,โ which will be discussed below. (See Doc. 309-1 at 6.) \nC.  Events After the Arrests  \nArrest teams took detainees to a prisoner processing team set up on Government Street, \nroughly between 10th Street and East Boulevard. (PRDSMF ยถ 25, Doc. 309-1 at 7.)  The prisoner \nprocessing team used template Affidavits of Probable Cause. (PRDSMF ยถ 26, Doc. 309-1 at 7.) \nThe processing officers would sign the affidavits under oath. (Jonathan Abadie Dep. 29:24โ30:5, \nDoc. 292-7.)  The officers were instructed to use the templates and common language, regardless \nof whether it reflected what actually occurred. (Joe Simoneaux Dep. 131:19โ132:6, Doc. 292-17.) \nThese Affidavits of Probable Cause are significant because an officer needs this affidavit, \na summons, or a warrant to arrest someone and to lawfully process them into the jail. (Alaina \nMancuso Dep. 11:11โ23, Doc. 298-10.)  Thus, Plaintiffsโ false arrest and imprisonment claims \nand manufacturing of evidence claims are tied to these affidavits. \nAn example of an Affidavit of Probable Cause used in this case is the following: \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 17 of 110\n \n(Doc. 292-8 at 1.)  Plaintiffs say of this affidavit, โNotice the facial inconsistencies: The caption \nsays Ms. Pollard violated R.S. 14:100.1; the synopsis says she violated R.S. 14:97. The synopsis \nsays she โfeloniouslyโ violated, even though both statutes are misdemeanors. The synopsis says \nthe protest was at โ9000 Airline Highway,โ nowhere near East & France.โ (Doc. 297-1 at 12 n.59.) \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 18 of 110\nSome of the affidavits listed an incorrect address. (PRDSMF ยถ 26, Doc. 309-1 at 7.)  Some \nwere corrected by hand, and a third variant had blanks for the officers to fill in with the location \nand offense. (Id.) \n Some of the Affidavits of Probable Cause were executed by officers who had observed \nthe offenses personally, but others were executed by officers without direct personal knowledge. \n(Id. ยถ 27.)  BRPDโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that it was โBRPD policy that the arrest team \nshould not stop and have a conversation with the processing teamโ and that โ[t]hey should simply \nhand off the arrestee and return to the front lines[.]โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 74:12โ17, Doc. 292-25; \nsee also id. at 59:21โ60:2 (โQ. And so if everything is working to . . .the [BRPDโs] system, the \nway officers have been trained, itโs not ever going to be the arrest teams who are making the arrests \nwho are filling out the probable cause affidavits? A. Yes.โ); Mark Dennis Dep. 28:11โ29:23, \n30:14, Doc. 292-23 (stating that state police officers who made the arrests would not fill out the \naffidavit and would not necessarily have a conversation with the person who did or explain who \nthe arrestee was and why they were arrested).)   \nSo, for example, Jonathan Abadie, who processed arrestees, testified he was not in eyesight \nof the protesters, but he could hear everything occurring. (Jonathan Abadie Dep. 11:24โ12:3, Doc. \n292-7.)  He vaguely spoke with the arresting officer, (id. at 14:25โ15:4), and said there was no \ndetailed flow of information going from the arresting officer to him, (id. at 18:8โ13).  Abadie said \nthe information in the affidavit was gathered or given to him at the time by word of mouth. (Id. at \n32:20โ33:20.)  โ[G]roups came in and those groups were all detained for the same reasons.โ (Id. \nat 34:4โ15.)  He based the information in the affidavit on the โtotality of the circumstances . . . \ngenerally told about what the protesters generally [did] that day[.]โ (Id. at 35:8โ22.)  Abadie was \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 19 of 110\nโgoing on good faith from other officers and the information [he] gathered from them[.]โ (Id. at \n55:1โ7.) \nWillie Williams, another processer, testified that the protesters were โpretty much in both \nroadways all around cutting up.โ (Willie Williams Dep. 16:25โ17:6, Doc. 292-24; see id. at 20:14โ\n23:9  (โchaos,  confusion,  cutting  up,โ  โacts  of  violence,โ  and  โprotesters  going  haywireโ).)   \nWilliams also based his affidavit on the officer bringing back the arrestee. (Id. at 41:18โ42:9.)  \nโ[I]t came from another officer. Iโm going off - - bouncing off of what he did.  If he said this \nhappened, this is him. You have something, you know, in place. Basically, youโre supposed to be \ntruthful and youโre supposed to be able to believe the fellow officer.โ (Id. at 46:14โ20.)  Williams \nsaid he was โtrusting the officer and doing it in good faith.โ (Id. at 79:1โ8.) \nBut Williams also said he was aware of large protests at East and France and that protesters \nwere  standing  in  that  location  and  obstructing  traffic.  (Id.  74:7โ75:15.)    โBased  on  the \ncircumstances presented that day and [his] knowledge of the events surrounding [his] location, \n[he] believe[d] the facts that [were] contained in these affidavits [were] true and correct . . . to the \nbest of [his] knowledge.โ (Id. at 75:16โ23.) \nOfficer James Thomas explained his observations to a prisoner processing officer and \ndirected him to sign the affidavit of probable cause on his behalf, leading to an affidavit of probable \ncause with the arresting officer listed simply as โThomas.โ (PRDSMF ยถ 27, Doc. 309-1 at 7.)   \nSome officers whose signature appears to be on some affidavits of probable cause state that \nthey did not sign those affidavits, and the actual person who signed those affidavits is unknown. \n(Id.)  Plaintiff maintains that these signatures were forged. (Doc. 297-2 at 3.) \nFor some plaintiffs, an intermediary was used between the arresting officers and the officer \nwho signed the Affidavits of Probable Cause.  For example, Officer Jason Dohm testified that \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 20 of 110\nโsomehow [Blair Imani] was handed or passed on to where we were standing, and our job was to \nthen escort her by walking her to where the transport team would be.โ (Jason Dohm Dep. 24:16โ\n23, 36:18โ37:5, Doc. 292-10.)  Dohm did not see her at all until she was โhanded offโ or โbasically \ngivenโ to them. (Id. at 30:14โ21.) Dohm said he โbelieve[d] she was arrested for the same thing \npretty much everybody was out there was arrested for,โ but he conceded that he did not have โfirst-\nhand knowledgeโ and โpersonally [did] not know.โ (Id. at 37:21โ38:10.)  Dohm said he did not \nhave any facts that would have supported probable cause for arresting Imani for resisting an officer \nthat day, and he did not pass on any information to people at the transportation area about why \nBlair was taken into custody. (Id. at 41:4โ25.)   \nOther officers testified similarly about their escorting Plaintiffs to the processing area. (See, \ne.g., Alaina Mancuso Dep. 25:18โ21, Doc. 292-20 (saying her only interaction with officers at the \nprocessing  station  was  โdropping  people  offโ).)    Ultimately,  as  one  Defendant  stated,  the \nโAffidavits of Probable Cause[] . . . donโt actually show us what happened during the protests[.]โ  \n(Joe Simoneaux Dep. 131:14โ132:11, Doc. 292-17.) \nIn any event, the protesters were charged with various misdemeanors, including simple \nobstruction of a highway, La. R.S. 14:97, simple obstruction of public passages, La. R.S. 14:100.1, \nand resisting arrest. (PRDSMF ยถ 28, Doc. 309-1 at 7.)  The district attorney subsequently declined \nto prosecute Plaintiffs. (Id.)  \nD.  The Cityโs Alleged Content-Based Discrimination and Conspiracy \nThe City argues that there is no Monell liability for any of its conduct, but Plaintiffs list \nseveral specific polices that support a finding that the City engaged, as a matter of official policy, \nin  viewpoint  discrimination.    Plaintiff  cite  the  following  as  evidence  of  First  Amendment \nviolations and a conspiracy. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 21 of 110\nFirst, the Cityโs representative testified that, even if the interstate was inaccessible to the \nprotesters at East and France, and even if it was otherwise peaceful, the protest was a civil disorder \nbased solely on their proximity to the interstate and the intentions of some of the protesters. (Rule \n30(b)(6) Dep. 28:2โ10, Doc. 292-25.)  โ[I]t was a civil disorder, because it was not a special event.  \nOur special events are, like, concerts, games, parades.  Thatโs special events.  That was not a \nspecial event.  They gathered for a specific purpose. . . . It was a protest purpose.โ (Id. at 28:10โ\n17.)  The representative said that it did not fall under the Special Event Policy because โit was a \nprotest for them to speak out against perceived misconduct by the [BRPD.]โ (Id. at 28:18โ24.)  \nBecause  of  this,  they  fell  under  the  Civil  Disorder  Policy.  (Id.  at  28:22โ29:2.)    The  City \nrepresentative further said, โif they had gathered together, say, for a church event or to talk about \nsales of water skis, that would fall under a special event, . . . [a]nd so because of that, the City . . . \ntreated this group at East and France under General Order 291, rather than the Special Event \nPolicy[.]โ (Id. at 29:3โ12.)   According to the Cityโs 30(b)(6) witness, once an assemblage falls \nunder the Civil Disorder Policy, the first supervisor is directed to disperse the crowd, even if it is \nminor/peaceful in nature. (DRPSMF ยถ 16, Doc. 311.) \nSecond, Plaintiffs also point to the Baton Rouge Policy and Procedure Manual and the fact \nthat the word โProtestsโ is used only once in the 904-page document, and then in reference to \nPrisoner Transport Vans: โThe vans may also be used in situations where there are or anticipated \nto be many arrestees, such as civil disturbances, protests, or the service of search and arrest \nwarrants.โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 38:14โ39:7, Doc. 292-25.)  That is the only treatment of the word \nโProtestโ in the entire manualโin the context of anticipating many arrestees. (Id. at 39:8โ18.)   \nThird, Plaintiffs also refer again to the fact that the Cityโs representative specifically stated \nthat โBRPD policy to target identified leaders and agitators.โ (Id. at 35:17โ19.)  Plaintiffs highlight \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 22 of 110\nthat BRPD provides in its Civil Disturbance Policy that the definition of โagitatorsโ includes those \nโPersons encouraging others to upset the status quo to further their cause,โ which a City Rule \n30(b)(6) representative understood to mean โpeople calling for a serious changeโ or those who \nโwant to see a major change in the politics of Baton Rouge[.]โ (Id. at 35:12โ25, 37:14โ38:13.)   \nAnd fourth, Plaintiffs cite the fact that BRPDโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that it was \nโBRPD policy that the arrest team should not stop and have a conversation with the processing \nteamโ and that โ[t]hey should simply hand off the arrestee and return to the front lines[.]โ (Id. at \n74:12โ17.)  According to Plaintiffs, that caused the fabrication of false affidavits, as the officers \nsigning them had no basis for the truth of that to which they were swearing. \nAs to the conspiracy, Plaintiffs also rely upon the testimony of Lieutenant Christopher \nTaylor. (Doc. 309-1 at 9.)  At his deposition, Plaintiffs played an audio clip of David Wallace (one \nof the shift leads), and Taylor stated:  \nQ. Just to repeat what is sounded to me like [Wallace] said, it was, \nYou've got one of the leaders requesting to walk on the sidewalk \npast France. Someone else responds, It's too late. Then 10-9. Then \nresponds, Too late. Everyone has violated.   Everyone is under \narrest.  Those  who  can  safely  apprehend  violators  must  do  so. \nPrimary targets are the white male, red hair, tie-dyed shirt, and \neveryone else who is violating, which is everybody out there. Does \nthat sound about right? \n \nA. Yes, sir. \n \n(Christopher Taylor Dep. 144:4โ22, Doc. 292-21; see also id. at 61:19โ62:3 (on Wallaceโs role).)  \nPlaintiffs maintain that the other officers also agreed because they โcomplied with the order for \nmass, indiscriminate arrests.โ (Doc. 309-1 at 9.) \nIII.

Indeed, even if the moving party comes forward \nwith an abundance of evidence supporting its theory of the case, the \nnonmoving party may nevertheless defeat the motion by countering \nwith evidence of its own, which, if credited by the fact-finder, would \nentitle the nonmoving party to a verdict in its favor.

That is, \nIn contrast, if the movant bears the burden of proof on a claim at \ntrial, then its burden of production is greater. It must lay out the \nelements of its claim, citing the facts it believes satisfies those \nelements, and demonstrating why the record is so one-sided as to \nrule out the prospect of the nonmovant prevailing. If the movant fails \nto make that initial showing, the court must deny the motion, even \nif the opposing party has not introduced contradictory evidence in \nresponse. \n \n10A Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) ยง 2727.1 (4th ed. 2022). \n  Additionally, โcross-motions [for summary judgment] must be considered separately and \nshould not be interpreted necessarily to mean that judgment should be entered on one of them[.]โ \n10A Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) ยง 2720 (4th ed. 2022).  \nThis is because โeach party, as a movant for summary judgment, bears the burden of establishing \nthat no genuine dispute of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.โ Id.   \nThe fact that one party fails to satisfy that burden on his own Rule \n56 motion does not automatically indicate that the opposing party \nhas satisfied its burden and should be granted summary judgment on \nthe other motion. The court must rule on each party's motion on an \nindividual and separate basis, determining, for each side, whether a \njudgment may be entered in accordance with the Rule 56 standard. \nBoth motions must be denied if the court finds that there is a genuine \ndispute of material fact.

Discussion of Federal Claims \nA.  Preliminary Issues \n1. Defendantsโ Motion as to Monell \nDefendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ Monell claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 19โ\n20.)6  However, Defendantsโ briefing on this issue is incomplete; their section on this issue consists \nof a short paragraph on the general law on Monell, a single introductory sentence to a second \nparagraph, and then an incomplete sentence, with nothing following. (Id.)7 \nPlaintiffs respond that, while Defendants included a section on Monell liability, they \nโneglected to include any argumentโ or analysis. (Doc. 309 at 20.)  Plaintiffs say they โcannot \nrespond to an argument that does not exist.โ (Id.)   After briefly asserting that have a viable Monell \nclaim, they urge denial of the motion. \nIn short, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion on this issue. Defendants have failed to \ndevelop any meaningful argument on this issue, and that failure constitutes a waiver.  See JTB \nTools & Oilfield Servs., L.L.C. v. United States, 831 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir. 2016) (stating that, \nโ[t]o avoid waiver, a party must identify relevant legal standards and โany relevant Fifth Circuit \ncasesโ โ and holding that, because appellant โfail[ed] to do either with regard to its underlying \nclaims,  .  .  .  those  claims  [were]  inadequately  briefed  and  therefore waived.โ  (citing, inter \nalia, United States v. Scroggins, 599 F.3d 433, 446โ47 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that it is โnot enough \nto merely mention or allude to a legal theoryโ))); see also United States ex rel. Wuestenhoefer v. \nJefferson, 105 F. Supp. 3d 641, 672 (N.D. Miss. 2015) (โThis failure to develop the relevant \n \n6 Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on their Monell claims. (Doc. 297-1 at 40.)  Plaintiffsโ motion will be \naddressed below. \n7 The extent of Defendantsโ argument on this issue is as follows: โPlaintiffs list ten (10) supposed policies as sub-parts \nto Paragraph 254, at Pages 69-70 of the Third Amended Complaint, followed by three paragraphs of conclusory \nallegations regarding the โpolicies, procedures, practices, customs, and usagesโ as the moving force behind the \nplaintiffsโ alleged injuries.

Holder, \n569 F.3d 250, 257 (6th Cir. 2009) (โIssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied \nby some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived. It is not sufficient for a party to \nmention a possible argument in [a] skeletal way, leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.โ)); \nUnited States ex rel. Byrd v. Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc., No. 18-312, 2022 WL 879492, at *13 \n(M.D. La. Mar. 23, 2022) (deGravelles, J.) (โProcedurally, the Court could easily find that such \nskeletal briefing in the original memorandum constitutes waiver.โ (citing above authorities)).  \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion as to Plaintiffsโ Monell claims.  \n2. Redundant Official Capacity Claims \nDefendants also move to dismiss the claims against Jonny Dunnam, who was the interim \nBRPD Chief of Police and who is sued in his official capacity. (Doc. 307-1 at 3.)  Defendants \nhighlight that the City has also been sued, a fact which makes the claims against Dunnam \nredundant. (Id.)   Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument. (See Doc. 309.) \nIn short, these claims will be dismissed.  First, Plaintiffs have failed to meaningfully oppose \nthe dismissal of the claims against Dunnam or otherwise respond to this argument, so they have \neffectively waived this issue. See JMCB, LLC v. Bd. of Com. & Indus., 336 F. Supp. 3d 620, 634 \n(M.D. La. 2018) (deGravelles, J.) (finding that claims could be deemed waived for failure to timely \noppose); Jordan v. Gautreaux, No. 21-48, 2022 WL 897549, at *15 n.2 (M.D. La. Mar. 25, 2022) \n(deGravelles, J.) (noting as additional ground for dismissal the fact that claims had not been \nsubstantively opposed); JTB Tools & Oilfield Servs., 831 F.3d at 601; Wuestenhoefer, 105 F. Supp. \n3d at 672. \nSecond, even if the claim had not been waived, Dunnam would be entitled to dismissal on \nthe merits.  โAs to the official capacity claims . . . , courts in this circuit have held that, when the \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 28 of 110\nsame official capacity claims are brought against an entity and its municipal officials, the claims \nagainst the officials are dismissed as redundant and duplicative.โ Jordan, 2022 WL 897549, at *22 \n(citing Zavala v. City of Baton Rouge/Par. of E. Baton Rouge, No. 17-656, 2018 WL 4517461, at \n*14 (M.D. La. Sept. 20, 2018) (deGravelles, J.) (โNevertheless, Zavala's claim in Count One names \nDr. Bridges as a defendant only in his official capacity. . . . As that claim is also asserted against \nthe  City/Parish  and  CorrectHealth,  it  is  duplicative  and  should  therefore  be  dismissed.โ \n(citing Castro Romero v. Becken, 256 F.3d 349, 355 (5th Cir. 2001) (district court correctly \ndismissed claims against municipal officers which โduplicate[d] claims against the respective \ngovernmental entities themselvesโ); Broussard v. Lafayette City-Par. Consol. Gov't, 45 F. Supp. \n3d 553, 571 (W.D. La. 2014) (โWhen . . . the government entity itself is a defendant in the \nlitigation, claims against specific individuals in their official capacities are redundant, and for that \nreason, courts in this circuit have found it is appropriate to dismiss them.โ)))). \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the official capacity claims against Jonny Dunnam are \nredundant to the claims against the City.  As a result, these claims will be dismissed. \n3. Qualified Immunity \nDefendants  also  invoke  qualified  immunity  as  to  the  individual  capacity  claims.  \nConsequently, the Court will provide a brief discussion of the relevant standards governing this \ndefense. \nโQualified immunity provides government officials performing discretionary functions \nwith a shield against civil damages liability, so long as their actions could reasonably have been \nthought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.โ Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d \n339, 345 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987)). โIn determining \nwhether an official enjoys immunity, we ask (1) whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a violation \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 29 of 110\nof a clearly established federal constitutional or statutory right and (2) whether the official's actions \nviolated  that  right  to  the  extent  that  an  objectively  reasonable  person  would  have \nknown.โ Id. (citing Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002)). Courts are โpermitted to exercise their \nsound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be \naddressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.โ Pearson v. Callahan, \n555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). \nAs to the first prong, the Court will provide lengthy discussions on the applicable law for \neach of these claims below.  More need not be said here. \nAs to the second prong, โ[q]ualified immunity attaches when an official's conduct does not \nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would \nhave known.โ Kisela v. Hughes, 138 S. Ct. 1148, 1152 (2018) (per curiam) (quoting White v. \nPauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (per curiam) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nโBecause the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, \nreasonableness  is  judged  against  the  backdrop  of  the  law  at  the  time  of  the \nconduct.โ Id. (quoting Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004) (per curiam)). \nโAlthough โ[the Supreme] Court's caselaw does not require a case directly on point for a \nright to be clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional \nquestion  beyond  debate.โ  โ Id. (quoting White,  137  S.  Ct.  at  551  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted)). โIn other words, immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who \nknowingly violate the law.โ Id. (quoting White, 137 S. Ct. at 551 (internal quotations omitted)). \n โ โOf course, general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and \nclear warning to officers.โ โ Kisela, 138 S. Ct. at 1153 (quoting White, 137 S. Ct. at 552 (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). โBut . . . [a]n officer โcannot be said to have violated a clearly \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 30 of 110\nestablished right unless the right's contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official \nin the defendant's shoes would have understood that he was violating it.โ โ Id. (quoting Plumhoff \nv. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 779โ80 (2014)). \nPhrased another way, โ[w]hen considering a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity, \n[the Court] must ask whether the law so clearly and unambiguously prohibited his conduct that \nโevery reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates [the law].โ โ McLin v. \nArd, 866 F.3d 682, 695 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 371 (5th Cir. \n2011) (en banc) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011))). โTo answer that question \nin the affirmative, we must be able to point to controlling authorityโor a robust consensus of \npersuasive authorityโthat defines the contours of the right in question with a high degree of \nparticularity.โ Id. (quoting Morgan, 659 F.3d at 371โ72 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting al-\nKidd, 563 U.S. at 742)). โWhere no controlling authority specifically prohibits a defendant's \nconduct, and when the federal circuit courts are split on the issue, the law cannot be said to be \nclearly established.โ Id. (quoting Morgan, 659 F.3d at 372). \nB.  First Amendment Claims  \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \na.  Defendantsโ Motion (Doc. 307) and Plaintiffsโ Opposition (Doc. \n309) \n \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffsโ reliance on Cox I and Cox II is misplaced. (Doc. 307-1 \nat 9.)  In Cox, the Supreme Court emphasized that the protests were peaceful, but, here, the โfilms \n. . . show a very different presentation and protest.โ (Id.)  According to Defendants, after the \nscheduled protest, โthe good people went home, and the protesters who wanted to shut down the \ninterstate continued east on Government Street to the easy access to I-110 at 10th Street.โ (Id. at 9โ\n10.)  Defendants then quote at length Cox to emphasize the governmentโs right to reasonably \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 31 of 110\nregulate speech to allow for passage on public streets. (Id. at 10.)  Defendants say the evidence \nโshow[s] an unruly mob, with the intent to disrupt local and interstate travel, who engaged in \nviolent acts against law enforcement, not a gentle procession of students led by a pastor.โ (Id.).  \nDefendants analogize to Adderley v. State of Florida, 385 U.S. 39 (1966), where the Supreme \nCourt purportedly affirmed arrests for those who blocked the entrance to a prison and who failed \nto disperse after being warned to do so. (Id.)  Defendants argue that this analysis resolves the \nalleged violations of Plaintiffsโ First Amendment to free speech, assembly, and press as well as \nthe analogous claims under the Louisiana constitution. \nPlaintiffs respond first that questions of fact preclude summary judgment. (Doc. 309 at 3.) \nโMost saliently,โ Plaintiffs dispute the characterization of the protest as โviolentโ or a โriot.โ (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs then highlight testimony from their experts and from Defendantsโ own Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeponent which demonstrate that the protests were in fact peaceful. (Id. at 3โ4.)  According to \nPlaintiffs, Defendantsโ entire argument on the First Amendment issue boils down to their statement \nthat Plaintiffs were not a peaceful protest but an unruly mob that had the intent to disrupt travel \nand engage in violent acts. (Id. at 4.)   Defendantsโ position on Cox I and Cox II essentially \nconcedes that, had the protests been nonviolent, then they would have been lawful. (Id.) Further, \nPlaintiffs note that the protesters complied by avoiding the interstate and by gathering on the \nsidewalks. (Id. at 4โ5.)  As to the allegations of violence, Defendants only refer to the โfilmsโ and \nโexhibitsโ without specifying which specifically shows that the protests were not peaceful. (Id. at \n5.)  Any violence on the video is not done by Plaintiffs but rather by other protesters or Defendants.  \n(Id.)  Most of the protesters complied with the orders to remain on private property and stand on \nthe curb. (Id. at 5โ6.) They remained there about an hour before being told that where they were \nstanding โwas not good enoughโ and the order was given to arrest them. (Id. at 6.)  Plaintiffsโ \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 32 of 110\nexperts likewise opined that the protest was peaceful and that the police did not have to resort to \nmass arrests and the use of force. (Id. at 7.)  Adderley is inapplicable, say Plaintiffs, because the \nissue in that case was โwhether protesters could commit a trespass on State property and continue \nprotesting, which is not alleged here.โ (Id. at 8.)  In any event, Defendants admitted at the Rule \n30(b)(6) deposition that there was no evidence that any Plaintiff was violent, no evidence any \nengaged in illegal activity, and no justification for the arrest beyond the information in the pre-\nprinted Affidavits of Probable Cause. (Id. at 8โ9.) \nb.  Plaintiffsโ Motion (Doc. 297), Defendantsโ Opposition (Doc. 310), \nand Plaintiffsโ Reply (Doc 323) \n \nPlaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on their First Amendment \nclaims.  (Doc. 297 at 1.)  They say that BRPD engaged in viewpoint discrimination by applying \nthe Civil Disorder Policy to the protest based solely on the content of the speechโthat is, because \nthe protesters were โspeaking out โagainst perceived misconduct by the Baton Rouge Police \nDepartment.โ โ (Id. at 24.)  The fact that the Civil Disorder Policy applied is significant, as that \npolicy allows for the use of force, contemplates mass arrests, and dictates military-style equipment. \n(Id. at 25.)  Most importantly, this policy requires that BRPD officers disperse a crowd, even if it \nis peaceful. (Id.)  Additionally, the Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) representative admitted that BRPD \ntargeted leaders and โagitators,โ or those who wanted to see change to Baton Rouge politics. (Id. \nat 26.)   Plaintiffs conclude: \nTo sum up: BRPD treated Plaintiffs under its Civil Disorder Policy \nrather than its Special Event policy explicitly because of the content \nof their speech. The Civil Disorder policy required officers to take \naction to disperse Plaintiffs and prevent them from continuing to \nexercise their right to protest. And BRPD also targeted โagitatorsโ \nfor arrest, which included people who โwant to see a major change \nin the politics of Baton Rouge.โ The Motion should therefore be \ngranted on First Amendment grounds. \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 33 of 110\n(Id.)  \n  Plaintiffs also say their case matches Cox II precisely. (Id. at 43.)  โThe key to the Courtโs \nholding was that Cox had been told he could remain in a certain area, and the subsequent dispersal \norder did not remove the protection accorded appellant by the original grant of permission.โ (Id. \nat 44 (cleaned up).)  โThe principle is clear: it is unconstitutional for law enforcement to tell \nprotesters where they can protest, and then arrest them once they go there.โ (Id.)   \nSo just as in Cox, protesters in 2016 were told where they could \nprotest. Just as in Cox, the streets were blocked off around the \nprotesters. And just as in Cox, the police changed their mind and \nswept in, saying โEveryone has violated. Everyone is under arrest. \nThose who can safely apprehend violators must do so.โ The same \nresult should follow as in Cox โa determination that the arrests were \nunconstitutional. \n \n(Id. at 45.) \n  In response, Defendants begin by incorporating the arguments in their own motion. (Doc. \n310 at 9 (citing Doc. 307-1 at 9โ14).)  Defendants say the protest fell under the โCivil Disorderโ \npolicy because of the protesterโs intention to overtake the interstate and their proximity to several \nentrances to I-110. (Id. at 9.)   Defendants assert: \nPlaintiffs present a wholly fictional version of their protest, in which \n(A) no one intended to disrupt the interstate system, (B) no one \nunderstood the commands not only to depart the roadway, but also \nthe commands to disperse and clear the area, (C) despite ample \nwarning and opportunity to depart the area, supported by evidence \nthat many protesters did leave the area, disperse, and were therefore \nnot arrested, that (D) the City had no basis on which to arrest the \nplaintiffs. \n \n(Id.)   Defendants rely upon their own chart and evidence that the protesters remained in the street \nand sidewalk. (Id. at 9โ10.)  Defendants emphasize that the crowd was told to disperse several \ntimes and maintain that it was the Cityโs position that the protesters were a riot that had the intent \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 34 of 110\nto block the interstate. (Id. at 10โ11.)  Again, the City has the right to keep the streets clear, and \nthey did so here. (Id.)   \n  Plaintiffsโ Reply again hammers the Cityโs admission that it employed the Civil Disorder \nPolicy because the protesters were speaking out against perceived police misconduct by BRPD. \n(Doc. 323 at 1.)  Here, not a single one of the protesters blocked the interstate, even if some wanted \nto. (Id. at 2.)  Protesters complied with law enforcementโs orders to avoid the interstate and go to \nEast and  France. (Id.)  They waited on private property an hour before the order was given to \narrest the protesters. (Id. at 2โ3.)  In any event, there is no evidence that any Plaintiff wanted to or \ntried to go onto the interstate or that there was still this threat after the protest moved to East and \nFrance. (Id. at 3.)   โInstead, the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiffs were among the group \nof protesters who complied with police orders to turn away from the interstate, were given \npermission to protest in a certain area, and were arrested anyway.[ ] That places them squarely \nwithin the facts of Cox[.]โ (Id.)  Given the heightened scrutiny involved here, Plaintiffs are entitled \nto summary judgment. \n2. Applicable Law \na.  First Amendment Generally \nโAs  applied  to  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution, the First Amendment prohibits the government from making laws that โabridg[e] the \nfreedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \nthe Government for a redress of grievances.โ โ San Antonio Firefighters' Ass'n, Loc. 624 v.

First Amendment and Protests \nThe Court finds that this case turns on Cox I and Cox II.  As previously stated, this pair of \ndecisions involved protests in Baton Rouge over racial segregation. Cox I, 379 U.S. at 538โ39.  \nThe sheriff eventually ordered that the protest be broken up, and the officers used tear gas to \ndisperse the crowd. Id. at 544.  Appellants were arrested and convicted of certain crimes. Id. at \n538.  Given the importance of both decisions, an extensive discussion is warranted. \ni.  Cox I \n \nCox  I  focused  on  petitionerโs  arrest  for  breach  of  the  peace  and  obstructing  public \nhighways, and the Supreme Court found that โLouisiana infringed appellant's rights of free speech \nand free assembly by convicting him under this [breach of the peace] statute.โ Id. at 545.  The \nHigh Court concluded that its โindependent examination of the record . . . show[ed] no conduct \nwhich the State had a right to prohibit as a breach of the peace.โ Id. \nAppellant led a group of young college students who wished โto \nprotest segregationโ and discrimination against Negroes and the \narrest of 23 fellow students. They assembled peaceably at the State \nCapitol building and marched to the courthouse where they sang, \nprayed and listened to a speech. A reading of the record reveals \nagreement on the part of the State's witnesses that Cox had the \ndemonstration โvery well controlled,โ and until the end of Cox's \nspeech,  the  group  was  perfectly  โorderly.โ  Sheriff  Clemmons \ntestified that the crowd's activities were not โobjectionableโ before \nthat time. They became objectionable, according to the Sheriff \nhimself, when Cox, concluding his speech, urged the students to go \nuptown and sit in at lunch counters. The Sheriff testified that the sole \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 38 of 110\naspect of the program to which he objected was โ[t]he inflammatory \nmanner in which he [Cox] addressed that crowd and told them to go \non up town, go to four places on the protest list, sit down and if they \ndon't feed you, sit there for one hour.โ Yet this part of Cox's speech \nobviously  did  not  deprive  the  demonstration  of  its  protected \ncharacter under the Constitution as free speech and assembly. \n \nId. at 545โ46.   \nThe State maintained that, though the demonstrators began orderly, certain actions such as \ncheering and clapping โconverted a peaceful assembly into a riotous one.โ Id. at 546.  The Supreme \nCourt rejected this argument: \nThe record . . . does not support this assertion. It is true that the \nstudents, in response to the singing of their fellows who were in \ncustody, cheered and applauded. However, the meeting was an \noutdoor meeting and a key state witness testified that while the \nsinging was loud, it was not disorderly. There is, moreover, no \nindication that the mood of the students was ever hostile, aggressive, \nor unfriendly. Our conclusion that the entire meeting from the \nbeginning until its dispersal by tear gas was orderly and not riotous \nis confirmed by a film of the events taken by a television news \nphotographer, which was offered in evidence as a state exhibit. We \nhave viewed the film, and it reveals that the students, though they \nundoubtedly cheered and clapped, were well-behaved throughout. \n \nId. at 546โ47.   \nLastly, the Supreme Court disagreed with the Stateโs argument that the conviction should \nbe maintained โbecause of fear expressed by some of the state witnesses that โviolence was about \nto eruptโ because of the demonstration.โ Id. at 550.  โIt is virtually undisputed, however, that the \nstudents themselves were not violent and threatened no violence.โ Id. \nUltimately, the statute was โunconstitutionally vague in its overly broad scope.โ Id. at 551.  \nThe definition of โbreach of the peaceโ โwould allow persons to be punished merely for peacefully \nexpressing unpopular views.โ Id.  \n Yet, a function of free speech under our system of government is to \ninvite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 39 of 110\ninduces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions \nas they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative \nand challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and \nhave profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an \nidea. That is why freedom of speech . . .  is . . . . protected against \ncensorship  or  punishment.  .  .  .  There  is  no  room  under  our \nConstitution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would \nlead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, courts, or \ndominant political or community groups. . . . Maintenance of the \nopportunity for free political discussion is a basic tenet of our \nconstitutional democracy. \n \nId. at 551โ52 (cleaned up).  For all these reasons, the Court found that โappellant's freedoms of \nspeech and assembly, secured to him by the First Amendment, as applied to the States by the \nFourteenth Amendment, were denied by his conviction for disturbing the peace.โ Id. at 552. \n  As to the obstructing public passages conviction, the appellate was convicted โfor leading \nthe meeting on the sidewalk across the street from the courthouse.โ Id. at 553.  โThere [was] no \ndoubt from the record in this case that this far sidewalk was obstructed, and thus, as so construed, \nappellant violated the statute.โ Id.  The issue before the Court was thus โthe right of a State or \nmunicipality to regulate the use of city streets and other facilities to assure the safety and \nconvenience of the people in their use and the concomitant right of the people of free speech and \nassembly.โ Id. at 554 (citations omitted).  The Court then explained: \nThe rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our \ndemocratic society, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or \nbeliefs to express may address a group at any public place and at any \ntime. The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of \nan organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty \nitself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. The control of travel \non the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to \ninsure this necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to \npromote  the  public  convenience  in  the  interest  of  all,  and  not \nsusceptible  to  abuses  of  discriminatory  application,  cannot  be \ndisregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which, in \nother circumstances, would be entitled to protection. One would not \nbe justified in ignoring the familiar red light because this was \nthought to be a means of social protest. Nor could one, contrary to \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 40 of 110\ntraffic regulations, insist upon a street meeting in the middle of \nTimes Square at the rush hour as a form of freedom of speech or \nassembly.  Governmental  authorities  have the  duty  and \nresponsibility to keep their streets open and available for movement. \nA group of demonstrators could not insist upon the right to cordon \noff a street, or entrance to a public or private building, and allow no \none to pass who did not agree to listen to their exhortations. \n \nWe emphatically reject the notion urged by appellant that the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments afford the same kind of freedom to \nthose who would communicate ideas by conduct such as patrolling, \nmarching,  and  picketing  on  streets  and  highways,  as  these \namendments afford  to  those  who  communicate  ideas  by  pure \nspeech. . . .  [I]t has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom \nof speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely \nbecause the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out \nby means of language, either spoken, written, or printed. \n \nId. at 554โ55 (cleaned up). \n  However, the statute at issue was โas if [it] expressly provided that there could only be \npeaceful parades or demonstrations in the unbridled discretion of the local officials.โ Id. at 557.  \nโThe pervasive restraint on freedom of discussion by the practice of the authorities under the \nstatute is not any less effective than a statute expressly permitting such selective enforcement.โ Id.  \nThe High Court explained: \nIt is clearly unconstitutional to enable a public official to determine \nwhich expressions of view will be permitted and which will not or \nto engage in invidious discrimination among persons or groups \neither by use of a statute providing a system of broad discretionary \nlicensing power or, as in this case, the equivalent of such a system \nby selective enforcement of an extremely broad prohibitory statute. \n \nIt is, of course, undisputed that appropriate, limited discretion, under \nproperly drawn statutes, or ordinances, concerning the time, place, \nduration, or manner of use of the streets for public assemblies may \nbe vested in administrative officials, provided that such limited \ndiscretion is exercised with โuniformity of method of treatment upon \nthe facts of each application, free from improper or inappropriate \nconsiderations and from unfair discrimination and with a systematic, \nconsistent  and  just  order  of  treatment,  with  reference  to  the \nconvenience of public use of the highways. \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 41 of 110\n \nId. at 557โ58 (cleaned up).  Because Baton Rouge had โallow[ed] unfettered discretionโ to its \nโlocal officials in the regulation of the use of the streets for peaceful parades and meetings,โ the \nstatute was a violation of appellantโs freedom of speech and assembly, so his conviction under the \nstatute as applied had to be reversed. Id. at 558. \nii.  Cox II \n \n  Cox II focused on petitionerโs conviction under La. R.S. 14:401, which โprohibit[ed] a \nparticular type of conduct, namely, picketing and parading, in a few specified locations, in or near \ncourthouses.โ 379 U.S. at 560, 562.  The Court first considered whether the statute was invalid on \nits face as an unlawful restriction on First Amendment freedoms. Id. at 560.  In finding that it was \nnot, the Court explained that the law was โpreciseโ and โnarrowly drawnโ and that โa State has a \nlegitimate interest in protecting its judicial system from the pressures which picketing near a \ncourthouse might create.โ Id. at 562.  The Court wrote: \nA State may adopt safeguards necessary and appropriate to assure \nthat the administration of justice at all stages is free from outside \ncontrol and influence. A narrowly drawn statute such as the one \nunder  review  is  obviously  a  safeguard  both  necessary  and \nappropriate to vindicate the State's interest in assuring justice under \nlaw. \n \nNor does such a statute infringe upon the constitutionally protected \nrights of free speech and free assembly. The conduct which is the \nsubject  of  this  statuteโpicketing  and  paradingโis  subject  to \nregulation even though intertwined with expression and association. \nThe examples are many of the application by this Court of the \nprinciple that certain forms of conduct mixed with speech may be \nregulated or prohibited. \n \nId. at 562โ63.  The Court held โthat this statute on its face is a valid law dealing with conduct \nsubject to regulation so as to vindicate important interests of society and that the fact that free \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 42 of 110\nspeech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection.โ Id. at \n564. \n  But, after rejecting certain other challenges to the statute as applied, the Supreme Court \nfound  that  the  convictions  must  be  overturned.  Id.  at  568.    Appellants  were  convicted  of \ndemonstrating โnearโ the courthouse, but the law was unclear on what constitutes โnear.โ  Id.  \nWhile officers had discretion to construe that term as โa limited control of the streets and other \nareas in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse,โ and while such discretion was proper in their \nmaking โdeterminations concerning the time place, duration, and manner of demonstrations,โ that \nwas โnot the type of unbridled discretion which would allow an official to pick and choose among \nexpressions of view the ones he will permit to use the streets and other public facilitiesโ which \nwere otherwise permissible. Id. at 569. \nHere, officials gave permission to the protesters to demonstrate at that location, and police \nnever suggested to the protesters that โthe demonstration be held further from the courthouse than \nit actually was.โ Id at 569โ70.  โIn effect, appellant was advised that a demonstration at the place \nit was held would not be one โnearโ the courthouse within the terms of the statute.โ Id. at 571.  The \nSupreme Court analogized the case to Raley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423 (1959), stating: \nAs in Raley, under all the circumstances of this case, after the public \nofficials acted as they did, to sustain appellant's later conviction for \ndemonstrating where they told him he could โwould be to sanction \nan indefensible sort of entrapment by the Stateโconvicting a citizen \nfor exercising a privilege which the State had clearly told him was \navailable to him.โ Id., at 426, 79 S. Ct., at 1260. The Due Process \nClause  does  not  permit  convictions  to  be  obtained  under  such \ncircumstances. \n \nId.   Cox II then clarified: \n \nThis is not to say that had the appellant, entirely on his own, held \nthe demonstration across the street from the courthouse within the \nsight and hearing of those inside, or a fortiori, had he defied an order \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 43 of 110\nof the police requiring him to hold this demonstration at some point \nfurther  away  out  of  the  sight  and  hearing  of  those  inside  the \ncourthouse, we would reverse the conviction as in this case. In such \ncases  a  state  interpretation  of  the  statute  to  apply  to  the \ndemonstration as being โnearโ the courthouse would be subject to \nquite different considerations. \n \nCox II, 379 U.S. at 571โ72. \n  The High Court then addressed the Sheriffโs dispersal order, as the State essentially \nโargue[d] that this order somehow removed the prior grant of permission and reliance on the \nofficialsโ construction that the demonstration on the far side of the street was not illegal as being \nโnearโ the courthouse.โ Id. at 572.  But the Supreme Court rejected this: \nAppellant was led to believe that his demonstration on the far side \nof the street violated no statute. He was expressly ordered to leave, \nnot  because  he  was  peacefully  demonstrating  too  near  the \ncourthouse, nor because a time limit originally set had expired, but \nbecause officials erroneously concluded that what he said threatened \na breach of the peace. This is apparent from the face of the Sheriff's \nstatement when he ordered the meeting dispersed: โNow, you have \nbeen allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your demonstration has \nbeen more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct \nviolation of the law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be \nbroken up immediately.โ See discussion in No. 24, ante, at 459โ\n462. Appellant correctly conceived, as we have held in No. 24, ante, \nthat this was not a valid reason for the dispersal order. He therefore \nwas still justified in his continued belief that because of the original \nofficial grant of permission he had a right to stay where he was for \nthe few additional minutes required to conclude the meeting. In \naddition, even if we were to accept the State's version that the sole \nreason  for  terminating  the  demonstration  was  that  appellant \nexceeded the narrow time limits set by the police, his conviction \ncould not be sustained. Assuming the place of the meeting was \nappropriateโas appellant justifiably concluded from the official \ngrant of permissionโnothing in this courthouse statute, nor in the \nbreach of the peace or obstruction of public passages statutes with \ntheir broad sweep and application that we have condemned in No. \n24, ante, at 463โ466, authorizes the police to draw the narrow time \nline,  unrelated  to  any  policy  of  these  statutes,  that  would  be \napproved if we were to sustain appellant's conviction on this ground. \nIndeed, the allowance of such unfettered discretion in the police \nwould itself constitute a procedure such as that condemned in No. \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 44 of 110\n24, ante, at 463โ466. In any event, as we have stated, it is our \nconclusion from the record that the dispersal order had nothing to \ndo with any time or place limitation, and thus, on this ground alone, \nit is clear that the dispersal order did not remove the protection \naccorded appellant by the original grant of permission. \n \nId. at 572โ73.  The Supreme Court then limited its holding: \n \nOf course this does not mean that the police cannot call a halt to a \nmeeting which though originally peaceful, becomes violent. Nor \ndoes it mean that, under properly drafted and administered statutes \nand ordinances, the authorities cannot set reasonable time limits for \nassemblies related to the policies of such laws and then order them \ndispersed when these time limits are exceeded. See the discussion in \nNo.  24,  ante,  at  463โ466.  We  merely  hold  that,  under \ncircumstances  such  as  those  present  in  this  case,  appellant's \nconviction cannot be sustained on the basis of the dispersal order. \n \nNothing we have said here or in No. 24, ante, is to be interpreted as \nsanctioning riotous conduct in any form or demonstrations, however \npeaceful  their  conduct  or  commendable  their  motives,  which \nconflict with properly drawn statutes and ordinances designed to \npromote law and order, protect the community against disorder, \nregulate traffic, safeguard legitimate interests in private and public \nproperty, or protect the administration of justice and other essential \ngovernmental functions. \n \nId. at 573โ74.  Consequently, the Supreme Court reversed appellantsโ convictions. Id. at 575. \nc.  Summary \n \nWhen synthesizing the general First Amendment law with Cox I and II, certain principles \nbecome clear.  First, individuals cannot โbe punished merely for peacefully expressing unpopular \nviews.โ Cox I, 379 U.S. at 551.  Second, the government has the right place reasonable restrictions \non demonstrations โto keep their streets open and available for movement,โ id. at 554โ55, but that \ndoes not allow the City to exercise โunbridled discretion,โ โselective enforcement,โ or โinvidious \ndiscriminationโ against those exercising their rights, id. at 557โ58.  And third, the State cannot \nโconvict[] a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State ha[s] clearly told him was available \nto him.โ Cox II, 379 U.S. at 571 (cleaned up).  Thus, the government cannot allow an individual \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 45 of 110\nto protest at a particular location and then, without justification, revoke the order. Id. at 572โ74.  \nBut the City can do so in the event of a breach of the peace, violence, or riotous behavior.  See id. \n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny both motions with respect to \nthe First Amendment claims.  In sum, the record is replete with genuine issues of material fact \nwhich preclude summary judgment.  The Court will address each motion in turn. \na.  Defendantsโ Motion \nAs to Defendantsโ motion, the Court agrees with Plaintiffsโ characterization of Defendantsโ \nposition: the heart of their motion on this issue is that the protesters acted violently, intended to \nobstruct the interstate, and were thus unlawful under the Cox cases. \nBut Plaintiffs provide considerable evidence establishing that the protests were in fact \norderly, nonviolent, and compliant.  At the outset, while there is evidence, highlighted above, that \nthe protesters wanted to march onto the interstate, other evidence contradicts this.  For instance, \nthe City conceded in its deposition that the intelligence officer had not surveyed the whole group \nand that it was โunclear . . . if that reflected the intentions of the entire group.โ (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) \nDep. 172:19โ23, Doc. 298-7.)  The representative also stated that he could not โput a number on \nwhoโ and that he would not โsay every single person knew exactly what they were doing, because \nthey might have just been just following them. . . . It sounds like impossible to answer . . . whether \nit was two, three, four or more people talking aboutโ entering the highway. (Id. at 225:18โ226:8.)  \nThus, there are questions of fact on the protestersโ intent to overrun the freeway.   \nFurther, even if the demonstrators did want to enter the interstate, there is some evidence \nthat they were told by police that they could. (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 191:11โ192:8, Doc. 292-25.)  \nThis creates further issues of fact as to whether the picketers engaged in illegal behavior.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 46 of 110\n  Other facts also support a finding that the protesters acted lawfully.  Plaintiffs cite the \nAffidavit of Probable Cause for each plaintiff, which says that BRPD Officers โwere assigned to \nprovide security for peaceful protests in the vicinity of 500 East Blvd.โ (See, e.g., Doc. 292-30 \n(emphasis added).)  A representative of the City also testified that โthe City does not have evidence \nof property destruction at the East and France protest.โ (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 19:7โ11, Doc. \n292-2.)  And, again, according to Plaintiffsโ chart, as verified by the Cityโs deposition, though a \nfew items were thrown, the City has no evidence Plaintiff did not comply with orders or that any \nPlaintiff engaged in an act of violence. (Rule 30(b)(6) Chart, Doc. 292-1 at 1; Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n26:19โ27:8, 36:14โ37:4, Doc. 292-2).)  It is also undisputed that the Cityโs representative said that \nโother than the affidavit of probable cause, the City does not have any description of any specific \nplaintiff's illegal activity.โ (DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. 311.)  \nPlaintiffsโ experts also support their position.  Robert Pusins stated in his report, โBased \non my review of the numerous videos, still photographs, the Complaint, and several Declarations \nand other case materials, it is evident that the Plaintiffs were involved in a non-violent protest[.]โ \n(Pusins Report, Doc. 309-2 at 47.)  He also opined, โit is my opinion that law enforcement had \nopportunities to allow the non-violent protesters to exercise their rights associated with assembly \nand free speech without resorting to mass arrests and uses of force but instead chose to confront, \nengage and arrest protesters who were in the Batiste yard.โ (Id. at 59.)   \nAnother expert for Plaintiffs, Dr. Peter B. Kraska, Professor of Police and Justice Studies \nfor Eastern Kentucky University, opined, โCompared to the bulk of protests Iโve witnessed and/or \nstudied, the group that had assembled at the corner of East Blvd. and France Street were extremely \ncompliant, non-violent, non-disruptive, and afraid.โ (Kraska Report, Doc. 309-3 at 6.)  Likewise, \nhe discussed the militarized police presence and found: \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 47 of 110\nThe police commanders of the actual operations treated the protest \nvenue in this case as being so volatile and threatening that they fully \nactivated  the  most  aggressive  elements  of  the  Miami-model, \ndeploying riot police with full armor, shields, less-lethal weaponry, \nand several SRTs donning full paramilitary garb, military-grade \nweaponry, armored personnel vehicles, and military-grade acoustic \nweapons. This approach might be necessary under circumstances \nwhere protesters were rioting, destroying property, or endangering \notherโs lives. However, the voluminous evidence reviewed revealed \nno justification for deploying this militarized response. Instead, it \nshows a peaceful assembly of Baton Rouge citizens exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights. \n \n(Id. at 5 (emphasis added).) \nPlaintiffs also submit the considerable evidence, highlighted above, which demonstrates \nthat the City engaged in content-based discrimination.  Such evidence includes (1) the Cityโs use \nof the Civil Disorder Policy rather than the Special Event Policy because โit was a protest for them \nto speak out against perceived misconduct by the [BRPD],โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 28:2โ29โ12, Doc. \n292-25); (2) the Baton Rouge Policy and Procedure Manual, which associated โprotestsโ only with \nโmany arrestees,โ (id. at 38:14โ39:18); (3) the Cityโs targeting of โagitators,โ and the definition of \nsame as those โ[p]ersons encouraging others to upset the status quo to further their cause,โ those \nโpeople calling for a serious change,โ or those who โwant to see a major change in the politics of \nBaton Rouge,โ (id. at 35:12โ25, 37:14โ38:13); and (4) the Cityโs policy to have officers โsimply \nhand off the arrestee and return to the front linesโ rather than  โstop[ping] and hav[ing] a \nconversation with the processing team,โ (id. at 74:12โ17), an approach which led to officers \nsigning affidavits which were untrue or which had no basis in truth.   \nAll of this content-based discrimination meant that โthe government must show that its \n[restriction] is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve \nthat end,โ which required that the โregulation [had to] be the least restrictive means available to \nthe government.โ Denton, 861 F. Appโx at 839 (cleaned up). With the conflicting evidence on the \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 48 of 110\npeacefulness of the protests, a reasonable jury could find that the City had no other compelling \nstate interest for breaking up the demonstration and arresting Plaintiffs.  And even if there was \nevidence establishing that the protest was violent, reasonable jurors could differ on whether the \nofficers employed the โleast restrictive means availableโ by conducting indiscriminate mass \narrests. \nFinally, the Cityโs reliance on Adderley is misplaced, as that case is easily distinguishable.  \nAdderley involved protesters charged with trespassing the curtilage of a jail. Adderley, 385 U.S. at \n46โ48.  The Supreme Court emphasized that, unlike Cox I and Cox II, a jail is not traditionally \nopen to the public, and the demonstrators were charged with trespass, not breach of the peace. Id. \nat 41โ42.  There was no evidence that this area had ever been used for protests, and the state had \nthe right to enforce its general trespass statute evenhandedly. Id. at 46โ48.  Indeed, the Court stated, \nโThere is not a shred of evidence in this record that this power was exercised, or that its exercise \nwas sanctioned by the lower courts, because the sheriff objected to what was being sung or said \nby the demonstrators or because he disagreed with the objectives of their protest.โ Id. at 47.  This \ncase is, of course, different, since there is ample evidence of the City discriminating on the basis \nof viewpoint. \nIn sum, construing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing \nreasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable juror could easily conclude that Plaintiffs acted \npermissibly under Cox I and II through protests that were peaceful, non-violent, and compliant \nwith police officers.  Further, a reasonable juror could likewise find that the City engaged in \nviewpoint discrimination through its response to the protests, that the City did not have a \ncompelling governmental interest in making the arrests, and that, even if it did, the City did not \nuse the least restrictive means available to it.  Consequently, Defendantsโ motion will be denied. \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 49 of 110\nb.  Plaintiffsโ Motion \n \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiffsโ cross motion will be denied.  Viewing the facts in a light \nmost favorable to Defendants and drawing reasonable inferences in their favor, Defendants have \npresented contrary evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the crowd intended \nto obstruct the interstate and refused orders to disperse amidst riotous behavior.  See Cox II, 379 \nU.S. at 572โ74. \nDefendants submit testimony and videos showing that the protesters were not peaceful.  \nAgain, one officer testified that โ[the police] started receiving the attacks with the items that were \nthrown at [them] from that area.  At that point, it was not lawful.โ (Myron Daniels Dep. 105:16โ\n106:5, Doc. 292-22.)  He estimated it was โquite a few people or it was more than five.โ (Id. at \n178:17โ19.)  Another officer testified that the protest was not peaceful because โ[t]here had been \na lot of things thrown from the crowd at officers,โ along with โthings that [were] being yelled and \n. . . the general atmosphere of the protesters.โ (Thomas Morse Dep. 51:17โ52:3, Doc. 298-16.)  \nDefendants lastly provide videos of at least two water battles being thrown at the officers. (Def. \nEx. DDDDD - From Finn - VID_20160710_193234661, at 00:10-00:12; Def. Ex. DDDDDDD - \nBlaze Opposite view of arrest (Antonio & Nadia), at 00:18-00:25.) \nAdditionally, Defendants tender proof that the demonstrators intended to obstruct public \npassages. Some of these protesters took active measures to block the roadway and prevent the \npolice from entering the intersection of East Boulevard and France Street, where they had gathered. \n(PRDSMF ยถ 13, Doc. 309-1.) Further, though no Plaintiff took part, a group of protesters formed \na human chain across East Boulevard to interpose themselves and block the law enforcement \nadvance across France Street. (Id.)   \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 50 of 110\nEven more important, as explained above, Defendants provide considerable evidence that \nthe protesters intended to enter the interstate, action which would block traffic and endanger the \npublic.  Again, one BRPD officer spoke to a purported leader of protesters who said that they were \ngoing to enter and block Interstate I-110. (See PRDSMF ยถ 4, Doc. 309-1 at 1; David Wallace Dep. \n102:17โ103:21,  Doc.  292-29.)    Another  officer  arrived  later  and  spoke  to  a  protester  who \nconfirmed her intention to block the freeway. (PRDSMF ยถ 5, Doc. 309-1 at 1.)  An undercover \nofficer also reported to his superiors that some of the protesters in the East and France group had \nexpressed an intent to go onto the interstate. (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 171:2โ23, 172:19โ23, \n224:14โ225:5, Doc. 298-7.)  As one Rule 30(b)(6) deponent stated: \nQ.  Is it the Cityโs position that the officers on the scene had a \nreasonable belief that if they had allowed these protesters to stay the \ncorner of France, that they would eventually enter the interstate? \n \nA.  It was a known fact, because communication with protesters \n- - because the intelligence officer in the crowd, we knew exactly \nwhat their intentions were.  So yes, sir, it was a fact. \n \n(Id. at 160:10โ19; see id. at 267:1โ8.)  And all of this happened with the Cityโs knowledge of \nprotesters in other cities engaging in such conduct (and, indeed, that it was a โcommon practiceโ). \n(Id. at 265:13โ266:3, 267:1โ268:17; see id. 264:10โ266:25; see also Def. Ex. EEEEEE -Hundreds \narrested BLM MSNBC (showing a news story containing clips of protesters on various interstates); \nDavid Wallace Dep. 102:2โ16, Doc. 298-21 (saying that Cityโs intelligence was โconsistent with \nwhat protesters ha[d] done around the nation prior to this eventโ).) \nFurther, as alluded to above, Defendants submit the video from the advocacy group \nJuvenile Justice Information Exchange.  That video contains a screenshot of text stating: \nSunday, July 10 \n \nProtesters peacefully march on Louisiana State Capitol. \n \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 51 of 110\nLater, some gather near the starting point of the march and find \nofficers blocking Government St. in attempts to avoid protesters \nwishing to block the nearby interstate.  \n \nProtesting continues . . . \n \n(Def. Ex. HHHHHH -Juvenile Justice Information Exchange, 2:05.) \nEqually important, a City representative testified that its position was that the officers on \nthe scene reasonably believed that a riot was occurring or was about to occur and that the protesters \ntaking over the interstate and blocking the interstate would fit the definition of a riot. (Rule 30(b)(6) \nDep. 202:11โ22, Doc. 298-7.)  Under Louisiana law,  \nA riot is a public disturbance involving an assemblage of three or \nmore persons acting together or in concert which by tumultuous and \nviolent conduct, or the imminent threat of tumultuous and violent \nconduct, results in injury or damage to persons or property or creates \na  clear  and  present  danger  of  injury  or  damage  to  persons  or \nproperty. \n \nLa. R.S. 14:329.1.  \n  Ultimately, the City testified to the obvious: โprotesters blocking off an interstate highway \nwould be a danger both to protesters and for other members of the public.โ (Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) \nDep. 159:8โ160:1, Doc. 298-7.)  It would have been โextremely dangerous, especially in that \nlocation. . . . It would have been disastrous.โ (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs rely on Cox II for the proposition that is โclearly unconstitutional for BRPD to \ntell a protester he could remain in a certain area, and then subsequently arrest him for failing to \ndisperse.โ (Doc. 323 at 3 (citing Cox II, 379 U.S. at 573).)  While Cox II does support this point \ngenerally, there are factual and legal problems with Plaintiffsโ contention. \n  Factually, Plaintiffs ignore summary judgment evidence presented by Defendants.  While \none officer told the protesters they could enter the interstate, (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 191:11โ192:8, \nDoc. 292-25), that officer โgave them some stall tactics to where [the police] could get the \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 52 of 110\nresources there to mitigate it,โ (David Wallace Dep. 104:2โ16, Doc. 292-29).  Moreover, that \npoliceman (Brandon Smith) also advised the leader, โWell, hold on.  We figured yโall would.  Itโs \ndangerous.โ (Id.)  Thus, Smithโs words did not constitute unambiguous permission to enter the \nhighway, and, in any event, given the size of the crowd and the danger, a reasonable juror could \neasily  find  his  statement  highly  reasonable  and  appropriate  (indeed,  necessary)  under  the \ncircumstances.   \nOther facts also support a denial of Plaintiffsโ motion.  At least one other officer was \ninstructing at least one other demonstrator not to enter the interstate, (Alaina Mancuso Dep. 28:5โ\n29:6, Doc. 292-20), and the Court can reasonably infer from this that other officers were doing the \nsame.  Further, according to some of Defendantsโ proof, Plaintiffs themselves were still in the \nstreet and sidewalk at various parts of the protest and that they were thus violating the law. \n(PRDSMF ยถ 19โ20, 24, Doc. 309-1; E.J. Lapeyrous Dep. 40:7โ41:15, Doc. 298-15; James Thomas \nDep. 78:18โ25; 81:8โ82:16, Doc. 298-19.)   \nCritically, there is also evidence in the record that orders were given to disperse throughout \nthe time the protesters were gathered at East and France and not just the single time Plaintiffs rely \nupon. (See, e.g., Thomas Morse Dep. 29:20โ23, 35:8โ36:15, 112:2โ113:7, Doc. 298-16; Def. Ex. \nSS KMW8273 07-10-16(4), at 00:35-0043 (โPlease disperse. Please leave the area, or you will be \narre . . .โ (Audio cut short)); ALK East Blvd. DSC_1918, at 00:55-01:15 (โYou are ordered to \ndisperse or you will be arrested. Everyone in the area . . . will be arrestedโ); Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n155:6โ22, Doc. 298-7 (stating that the crowd โfailed to disperse after given ordersโ and that โonce \nthe resources got there to make arrests, arrests were madeโ).)  Thus, unlike Cox II, a reasonable \njury could conclude that Plaintiffs did not have a prior authorization revoked but were rather told \nto vacate the area throughout their time on East and France. \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 53 of 110\nLegally, Plaintiffs omit critical language from Cox II.  As stated above, the High Court \nqualified that it โmerely h[e]ld that, under circumstances such as those present in this case, \nappellantโs conviction [could not] be sustained on the basis of the dispersal order.โ Cox II, 379 \nU.S. at 573.  The Supreme Court specifically clarified: \nOf course this does not mean that the police cannot call a halt to a \nmeeting which though originally peaceful, becomes violent. . .  \n \nNothing we have said here or in [Cox I] is to be interpreted as \nsanctioning riotous conduct in any form or demonstrations, however \npeaceful  their  conduct  or  commendable  their  motives,  which \nconflict with properly drawn statutes and ordinances designed to \npromote law and order, protect the community against disorder, \nregulate traffic, safeguard legitimate interests in private and public \nproperty, or protect the administration of justice and other essential \ngovernmental functions. \n \nId. at 573โ574. \nIn sum, given the evidence that the protesters were not peaceful and in fact riotous, given \ntheir refusal to disperse despite numerous requests to do so, given the evidence of potential \nviolence from the demonstrators, and given some picketersโ intent to obstruct the interstate, Cox \nIIโs conclusion is distinguishable, particularly when seen from Defendantsโ facts with reasonable \ninferences drawn in their favor.  That is, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendantsโ conduct \nwas necessary to serve the compelling state interests of protecting public safety and ensuring the \nfree flow of traffic and that they employed the least restrictive means to accomplish that end.  See \nDenton, 861 F. Appโx at 839 (cleaned up).  At the very least, the Court cannot say that โthe record \nis so one-sided as to rule out the prospect of the [Defendants] prevailing.โ Kane, Wright & Miller, \nsupra, at ยง 2727.1.  As a result, Plaintiffsโ motion will be denied. \n \n \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 54 of 110\nC.  First Amendment Freedom of Press  \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nDefendants next turn to the freedom of press claims asserted by Plaintiffs Karen Savage \nand Cherri Foytlin.  (Doc. 307-1 at 11โ12.)  According to Defendants, the exhibits show these \nPlaintiffs were in the roadway, on the sidewalks, and within feet of the officers as the officers were \ntrying to effectuate arrests and โgain control of the intersection.โ (Id. at 12.)  Defendants maintain \nthat these Plaintiffs were interfering with the policemenโs performing their duties and โneedlessly \nincreasing the risk of injury to themselves, the officers, and the arrestees.โ (Id.)  Defendants then \ncite to the latitude Former Chief Dabadie gave from BRPD to reporters who filmed (absent the \nreportersโ โinterfering with police work or creating unsafe conditions, which is precisely what is \nshown by the exhibitsโ). (Id.)  Defendants also rely on the officersโ training. (Id.) \nPlaintiffs respond by saying that โDefendants provide no evidence that Foytlin or Savage \nactually interfered.โ (Doc. 309 at 9.)  Plaintiffs say that the specific time stamp on the video of \nFoytlin merely shows her taking a photo of an arrest before stepping back, and no officer seemed \nto notice her presence or acknowledge her.  (Id.)  The same goes for the other timestamped image \nof Foytlin.  (Id.)  As for Savage, there are no examples of her interfering with the police, and, \nindeed, Defendants concede on the chart that they have no evidence that these Plaintiffs (or any \nothers) did not comply with orders. (Id.)  Plaintiffs acknowledge that there can be reasonable time, \nplace, and manner restrictions, but they say that โDefendants have not suggested that any such \nrestrictions were placed on journalists or communicated to either Foytlin or Savage.โ (Id. at 10.)  \nIn sum, because there is no evidence either of these Plaintiffs interfered with law enforcement, \nsummary judgment should be denied. \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 55 of 110\n2. Applicable Law \n \nโThe First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.โ Turner v. \nLieutenant Driver, 848 F.3d 678, 688 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing U.S. Const. amend. I). โBut โthe First \nAmendment goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit \ngovernment from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw.โ \nโ Id. (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 783 (1978)).  โNews-gathering, \nfor example, is entitled to first amendment protection, for without some protection for seeking out \nthe news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated, even though this right is not absolute.โ Id. \n(cleaned up).  โThe Supreme Court has also recognized a First Amendment right to โreceive \ninformation and ideas[.]โ โ Id. (quoting Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer \nCouncil, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 757 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Further, โthere is โan \nundoubted right to gather news from any source by means within the law.โ โ Id. (quoting Houchins \nv. KQED, Inc., 438 U.S. 1, 11 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nโIn addition to the First Amendment's protection of the broader right to film, the principles \nunderlying the First Amendment support the particular right to film the police.โ Id.  As the Fifth \nCircuit has explained: \nThere is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of the \nFirst Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental \naffairs. To be sure, speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, \nfor it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people. The \nright of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information \nto reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government \nand a necessary means to protect it. Filming the police contributes \nto the public's ability to hold the police accountable, ensure that \npolice officers are not abusing their power, and make informed \ndecisions about police policy. Filming the police also frequently \nhelps officers; for example, a citizen's recording might corroborate \na probable cause finding or might even exonerate an officer charged \nwith wrongdoing. \n \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 56 of 110\nId. at 690 (cleaned up).   \nThus, the Fifth Circuit has โagree[d] with every circuit that has ruled on this question: Each \nhas concluded that the First Amendment protects the right to record the police.โ Id. (citations \nomitted).  That is, โ[t]he filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place, \nincluding police officers performing their responsibilities, fits comfortably within [basic First \nAmendment] principles.โ Id. (quoting Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2011)).  \nBut, โ[t]his right . . . โis not without limitations.โ โ Id. (quoting Glik, 655 F.3d at 84).  โLike \nall speech, filming the police may be subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.โ \nId. (cleaned up). โ[W]hen police departments or officers adopt time, place, and manner restrictions, \nthose restrictions must be โnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.โ โ Id. \n(quoting McCullen v.

(quoting McCullen, 134 S. Ct. at 2535 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n3. Analysis   \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion on this \nissue.  Again, questions of fact preclude summary judgment. \nDefendants point to the evidence of Foytlin and Savage in the street and allegedly violating \npolice orders.  For example, Plaintiff Cherri Foytlin was arrested on France Street at about the \nsame time as the push into the yard. (PRDSMF ยถ 20, Doc. 309-1.)  Photographs and video show \nCherri Foytlin at multiple locations throughout the protest, in the roadway and on sidewalks at \nvarious points in time. (Id.)  As to Plaintiff Karen Savage, an officer testified that she was given \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 57 of 110\nโloud verbal commands to get out of the roadwayโ and that โ[s]he refused to multiple times.โ \n(James Thomas Dep. 78:18โ25, Doc. 298-19.)  Defendants also assert that photographs and video \nshow Karen Savage at multiple locations throughout the protest, in the roadway and on sidewalks \nat various points in time. (See Def. Ex. ALK 1908, 1929, 1950, 1999, 2006, 2009, 2031, 2053, \n2066.)   They also provide a video of her arrested near the McDonalds. (Def. Ex. DeSavlo East \nBlvd. protests 7-10-16 (8).)  Further, as highlighted extensively above, the City points to concerns \nabout the interstate being overrun. (PRDSMF ยถยถ 4, 5, Doc. 309-1 at 1; Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n171:2โ23, 172:19โ23, 267:1โ268:17, Doc. 298-7.)   \nThis evidence does not, however, entitle Defendants to summary judgment.  At best, these \npictures and video show that these Plaintiffs were in the street and on the sidewalk at various \npoints.  They do not definitively show that these Plaintiffs violated orders or any other โreasonable \ntime, place, and manner restrictionsโ imposed by the police. See Turner, 848 F.3d at 690.   To the \ncontrary, Plaintiffs submit their own evidenceโagain, through the Rule 30(b)(6) Chart and \nverifying testimonyโthat (1) the City has no proof that Plaintiffs did not comply with orders, and \n(2) that, โother than the affidavit of probable cause, the City does not have any description of any \nspecific plaintiff's illegal activity.โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Chart, Doc. 292-1 at 1; Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n26:19โ27:8, 36:21โ37:4, Doc. 292-2; DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. 311.)  Equally important, the images \nand video submitted by Defendants do not show that either of these Plaintiffs interfered with police \nofficers, or, at the very least, a reasonable jury could find so. \nAs a result, construing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing \nreasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable juror could easily find that Defendantsโ decision \nto prevent Savage and Foytlin from performing their investigative work was not โnarrowly tailored \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 58 of 110\nto serve a significant government interest.โ Turner, 848 F.3d at 690.  Consequently, Defendantsโ \nmotion on this issue will be denied.8 \nD.  First Amendment Retaliation \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \na.  Defendantsโ Motion (Doc. 307) and Plaintiffsโ Opposition (Doc. \n309) \n \nDefendants next  attack  the First  Amendment  retaliation claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 12.)  \nAccording to Defendants, the record evidence shows that the protesters intended to shut down the \ninterstate,  and  the  officers  stopped  them  from  doing  so.  (Id.  at  13.)    Defendants  also  say \ndemonstrators were given many orders to disperse, but they refused to do so. (Id.)  Defendants \nassert that the officers executing the Affidavits of Probable Cause were within earshot of the \ndispersal order and had โvarying levels of communication with the officers escorting detainees to \nthe processing area.โ (Id.)  They were aware of the circumstances on the ground and โrelied on \ntheir collective experience and fellow officers to execute the [A]ffidavits of [P]robable [C]ause.โ \n(Id.)  Defendants point to various violations individual officers observed and some affidavits \nexecuted by unknown persons. (Id. at 13โ14.)  โThat system was imperfect, but the general \n \n8 Defendants, in a conclusory way, say in briefing that they โhave asserted their defense of qualified immunity through \ntheir answer, and [they] respectfully suggest that the evidence presented demonstrates their eligibility for qualified \nimmunity.โ (Doc. 307-1 at 5.)  Additionally, Defendants mention but do not elaborate upon the fact that Turner ruled \nthat the โFirst Amendment protects the right to record the policeโ โ[h]enceforthโ after February 16, 2017, and that the \nFifth Circuit specifically found that โthere was no clearly established First Amendment right to record the police at \nthe time of Turner's activitiesโ in September 2015 because of โthe absence of controlling authority and the dearth of \neven persuasive authority.โ (Doc. 307-1 at 11 (citing Turner, 848 F.3d at 687).)  Again, โ[i]ssues adverted to in a \nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived. It is not \nsufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in [a] skeletal way, leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.โ \nWuestenhoefer, 105 F. Supp. 3d at 672 (quoting ElโMoussa, 569 F.3d at 257).  Consequently, the Court will pass on \ndeciding whether the right to record the police was clearly established at the time of these protests in July 2016.  Any \nsuch argument is deemed waived. \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 59 of 110\nconditions  and  common  violations  were  well  known  to  the  officers,  and  sufficient  for  a \ndetermination of probable cause, which does not require certainty, only probability.โ (Id. at 14.) \n  Plaintiffs (correctly) respond that the sole basis for Defendantsโ motion is the absence of \nprobable cause. (Doc. 309 at 11.)  Plaintiffs maintain that โDefendants have not produced one \nshred of evidence other than the Affidavits of Probable Cause that any Plaintiff failed to comply \nwith orders, threw any object at law enforcement or committed any other act of violence, or even \nunlawfully blocked the intersection.โ (Id.)  โDefendantsโ argument seems to be simply that because \nPlaintiffs were present at East and France, they must have violated some law, though no violation \nhas been caught on the hours of video footage from the protest.โ (Id.)  Here, the Affidavits of \nProbable  Cause  are  insufficient  because  probable  cause  requires  โsome  knowledgeโ  of  the \narresting officer at the moment of arrest that an offense had been or was being committed. (Id. at \n11โ12.)  But, here, the people executing the Affidavits of Probable Cause had no knowledge of \nthe circumstances of the arrest. (Id. at 12.)  Indeed, the officers specifically said that the arrest team \nshould stop having a conversation with the processing team and should instead simply hand over \nthe arrestee, thereby eliminating any โflow of informationโ from the arresting officer to the officer \nthat signed the affidavit. (Id. at 13.)  Consequently, the arresting officer had no basis to arrest the \nindividual other than his participation in an arrest, and that is retaliation. (Id.)   \nAs to the retaliatory motive, Plaintiffs rely upon the choice of the Civil Disorder Policy \nrather than the Special Events Policy. (Id. at 13.)  Plaintiffs quote the Cityโs Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeposition, which they say reflects that โDefendants chose to arrest Plaintiffs specifically because \nthey were speaking out โagainst perceived misconduct by the Baton Rouge Police Department.โ โ \n(Id. at 14.)  Plaintiffs then quote Defendantsโ briefing wherein they say officers have a โ โduty and \nobligation . . .  to preventโ crowds which are โhostile to law enforcement.โ โ (Id. at 14โ15.)  \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 60 of 110\nโDefendants  have  explicitly  admitted  โ  and  continue  to  argue  โ  that  animus  towards  law \nenforcement was a motivating factor in the unlawful arrests and, therefore, the motion should be \ndenied.โ (Id. at 15.) \nb.  Plaintiffsโ Motion (Doc. 297), Defendantsโ Opposition (Doc. 310), \nand Plaintiffsโ Reply (Doc 323) \n \nPlaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to summary judgment on their retaliation claims. \n(Doc. 297-1 at 27.)   Plaintiffs assert that, with only one exception, the officers testified that no \none had been arrested for the crimes for which these protesters were supposedly arrested. (Id.)  \nSome officers did not even know these laws existed. (Id.)  Many officers said it was not uncommon \nto find other individuals violating this law, yet they were not arrested; rather, Plaintiffs were \narrested only after they objected to police misconduct. (Id. at 28.)  The officers also could not \nremember using preprinted affidavits despite their combined 119 years of service and despite \nunruly scenes and places like LSU games and Mardi Gras parades.  (Id. at 28โ29.)   Moreover, this \nprotest is the only time BRPD has ever deployed a LRAD, and they used it without full knowledge \nof how to operate it. (Id. at 29โ30.)  Moreover, no officer completed a use of force report following \nthe incident. (Id. at 30.)  Lastly, despite numerous lawsuits and investigations into what happened \nby outside organizations, BRPD has conducted only one investigation, and that was into violating \npeopleโs rights and wrongfully arresting protesters that had a right to be on the median. (Id.) \nDefendantsโ opposition, (see Doc. 310), and Plaintiffsโ reply, (see Doc. 323), echo their \nother First Amendment arguments summarized above. \n2. Applicable Law \nโ  โ[A]s  a  general  matter  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  government  officials  from \nsubjecting an individual to retaliatory actionsโ for engaging in protected speech.โ Nieves v. \nBartlett, 139 S. Ct. 1715, 1722 (2019) (quoting Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006)). As \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 61 of 110\nthe Fifth Circuit has explained, โ[t]o prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, Plaintiff must \ndemonstrate that (1) he was engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) the officers' action \ncaused him to suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to \nengage in that activity, and (3) the officers' adverse actions were substantially motivated against \nPlaintiff's exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.โ Alexander v. City of Round Rock, 854 \nF.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). \n โBut if an officer has probable cause to seize that individual, โthe objectives of law \nenforcement take primacy over the citizenโs right to avoid retaliation.โ โ Davidson v. City of \nStafford, Texas, 848 F.3d 384, 391 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Allen v. Cisneros, 815 F.3d 239, 245 \n(5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d 252, 261โ62 (5th Cir. 2002))).  Thus,  โ[t]he \nFirst Amendment does not entitle a citizen to obstruct traffic or create hazards for others.โ \nSingleton v. Darby, 609 F. Appโx 190, 193 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (citing, inter alia, Cox, \n379 U.S. at 553โ558).  โA State may therefore enforce its traffic obstruction laws without violating \nthe First Amendment, even when the suspect is blocking traffic as an act of political protest.โ Id. \n(citing, inter alia, Cox, 379 U.S. at 553โ558).   \nIn sum, โ[a]bsent [ ] a showing [of no probable cause], a retaliatory arrest claim fails.โ \nNieves v. Bartlett, 139 S. Ct. 1715, 1725 (2019).  โBut if the plaintiff establishes the absence of \nprobable cause, then . . . the plaintiff must show that the retaliation was a substantial or motivating \nfactor behind the arrest, and, if that showing is made, the defendant can prevail only by showing \nthat the arrest would have been initiated without respect to retaliation.โ Id. (cleaned up). \nBut, โ[a]lthough probable cause should generally defeat a retaliatory arrest claim, a narrow \nqualification is warranted for circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, \nbut typically exercise their discretion not to do so.โ Id. at 1727.  โIn such cases, an unyielding \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 62 of 110\nrequirement to show the absence of probable cause could pose a risk that some police officers may \nexploit the arrest power as a means of suppressing speech.โ Id. (cleaned up).  The High Court \nexplained: \nFor example, at many intersections, jaywalking is endemic but \nrarely  results  in  arrest.  If  an  individual  who  has  been  vocally \ncomplaining about police conduct is arrested for jaywalking at such \nan intersection, it would seem insufficiently protective of First \nAmendment rights to dismiss the individual's retaliatory arrest claim \non the ground that there was undoubted probable cause for the arrest. \n \nId.   Thus, โthe no-probable-cause requirement should not apply when a plaintiff presents objective \nevidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the \nsame sort of protected speech had not been.โ Id. at 1727 (citation omitted).  โAfter making the \nrequired showing, the plaintiff's claim may proceed in the same manner as claims where the \nplaintiff has met the threshold showing of the absence of probable cause.โ Id. (citation omitted). \n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny both motions on the retaliation \nclaims.  Again, questions of fact preclude summary judgment.  \na.  Defendantsโ Motion \nDefendantsโ motion is easily denied.  As Plaintiffs argue, the sole basis of their motion is \nthat there was probable cause to effectuate the arrest.  But Plaintiffs have submitted considerable \nobjective  evidence  that  the  no-probable-cause  requirement  should  not  apply  because  other \nsimilarly situated individuals not engaged in the protected speech were not arrested. See Nieves, \n139 S. Ct. at 1725. Plaintiffs specifically provide the deposition testimony of many officers who, \nin their combined experience, could not recall a time where they arrested someone on the charge \nof obstruction of a highway (La. R.S. 14:97)  or obstruction of a public passageway statutes (La. \nR.S. 14:100.1) enforced. (See, e.g., Jonathan Abadie Dep. 54:9โ25, Doc. 292-7 (8 years); Derrick \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 63 of 110\nWilliams Dep. 42:3โ25, Doc. 292-9 (23 years); Ira Roberts Dep. 47:18-49:5, Doc. 292-16 (23 \nyears).)  Likewise, other officers testified that they could not remember a time prior to July 2016 \nwhere a synopsis of probable cause was filled out the way it was for the protests. (See, e.g., Derrick \nWilliams Dep. 66:24โ67:4, Doc. 292-9.)  All of this leads to the conclusion that the City \ndiscriminated  against  the  protesters  and  that  Plaintiffs  can  avoid  the  no-probable-cause \nrequirement. \nFurther, Plaintiffs have shown that retaliation was โa substantial or motivating factor \nbehind the arrest.โ Nieves, 139 S. Ct. at 1725 (cleaned up).  As explained in the other First \nAmendment section above, a reasonable juror could look at the use of the Civil Disorder Policyโ\nthe facts that it was used because โit was a protest for them to speak out against perceived \nmisconduct by the [BRPD],โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 28:18โ24, Doc. 292-25), and the representativeโs \nstatement that, โif they had gathered together, say, for a church event or to talk about sales of water \nskis, that would fall under a special eventโ policy rather than the Civil Disorder Policy, (id. at \n29:3โ12)โand conclude that Plaintiffs were retaliated against by the City based on the content of \ntheir speech.   \nAs to the officers, Plaintiffsโ chart, cited numerous times above, shows no refusal by \nPlaintiffs to follow orders and no acts of violence which would necessitate and arrest.  Further, the \nchart also shows that, with a few exceptions, the City had no knowledge of which officer saw \nwhich Plaintiff commit any crime, (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 42:21โ43:18, Doc. 292-2), or what officer \nseized what Plaintiff, (id. at 45:4โ9).  And there is considerable evidence documented above that, \nfor many officers, there was little if any communication between the arresting officers and the \nofficers processing Plaintiffs and thus producing the Affidavits of Probable Cause that would result \nin their imprisonment. (See Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 74:12โ17, 59:21โ60:2, Doc. 292-25; Mark Dennis \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 64 of 110\nDep. 28:11โ29:23, 30:14, Doc. 292-23; Jonathan Abadie Dep. 11:24โ12:3, 14:25โ15:4, 18:8โ13, \n32:20โ33:20, 34:4โ15, 35:8โ22, 55:1โ7, Doc. 292-7; Willie Williams Dep. 46:14โ20, 79:1โ8, \nDoc. 292-24.)  Again, it is undisputed that, โother than the affidavit of probable cause, the City \ndoes not have any description of any specific plaintiff's illegal activity,โ (DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. \n311), yet, as one Defendant said, the โAffidavits of Probable Cause[] . . . donโt actually show us \nwhat happened during the protests,โ  (Joe Simoneaux Dep. 131:14โ132:11, Doc. 292-17).   \nIn sum, construing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing \nreasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable juror could, without difficulty, conclude that \nPlaintiffs were retaliated against in violation of the First Amendment.  That is, a reasonable jury \ncould find from all of the above evidence (a) that the no-probable-cause rule does not apply, (b) \nthat Plaintiffs established that a substantial motivating factor behind the arrest was retaliation, and \n(c) that Defendants did not show that the arrest would have occurred without that retaliation.  See \nNieves, 139 S. Ct. at 1725 (cleaned up).  Defendantsโ motion is thus denied. \nb.  Plaintiffsโ Motion \nPlaintiffsโ motion is a closer call but ultimately still warrants denial.  Even assuming \nPlaintiffs had shown, beyond doubt, the absence of probable cause, and even assuming that \nPlaintiff had proven, beyond peradventure, that retaliation was a โsubstantial or motivating factor \nbehind  the  arrest,โ  a  reasonable  jury  could  find  that  Defendants  have  met  their  burden  of \nestablishing that โthe arrest would have been initiated without respect to retaliation.โ Nieves, 139 \nS. Ct. at 1725; see also Fontenot, 780 F.2d at 1194.   \nThis conclusion is warranted from all of the evidence highlighted above addressing \nPlaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on their First Amendment claimsโi.e., the evidence \nshowing that the protesters were not peaceful but rather riotous, that they had the intent to block \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 65 of 110\nthe interstate, that these specific Plaintiffs obstructed the street and sidewalk despite numerous \nreasonable orders to the contraryโand on the officersโ good faith reliance on the information \nprovided to them, (Willie Williams Dep. 41:18โ42:9, 46:14โ20, 79:1โ8, Doc. 292-24; Jonathan \nAbadie Dep. 35:8โ22, 55:1โ7, Doc. 292-7).  For these same reasons, the Court cannot conclude \nthat โthe record is so one-sided as to rule out the prospect of [Defendants] prevailing.โ Kane, supra, \nat ยง 2727.1.   \nAnd, even if the Plaintiffs had established these First Amendment violations, a reasonable \njury could find that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.  Given the above facts and the \nCourtโs finding that Defendantsโ conduct could comply with Cox II, the Court cannot say that โthe \nlaw so clearly and unambiguously prohibited [their] conduct that every reasonable official would \nunderstand that what [they were] doing violate[d] [the law].โ McLin, 866 F.3d at 695.  At the very \nleast, reasonable minds could differ, and, for this additional reason, Plaintiffsโ motion will be \ndenied.  \nE.  False Arrest, Imprisonment, and Manufacturing of Evidence \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \na.  Defendantsโ Motion (Doc. 307) \nDefendants next attack Plaintiffsโ false arrest and false imprisonment claims. (Doc. 307-1 \nat 14.)  They say that both of these claims require a finding of probable cause, but, as Defendants \nhave shown, โthere was probable cause to believe that the plaintiffs had obstructed a roadway, and \nthat many, though perhaps not all, had resisted arrest.โ (Id. at 15.)  Though other charges may be \napplicable, 20/20 hindsight is not required of officers. (Id.) โThe question remains whether the \nofficers made reasonable determinations based on what they knew at that time.โ (Id.) \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 66 of 110\n  In response, Plaintiffs refer to prior arguments and maintain that their false arrest and \nimprisonment claims survive. (Doc. 309 at 15.) They contend that, even if more accurate charges \napplied, Defendants admit that they lacked knowledge of whether Plaintiffs failed to disperse. (Id.)  \nMoreover, many Plaintiffs were arrested several blocks away after complying with the dispersal \norder. (Id.)  Others were arrested on the sidewalk, and they believed they were complying. (Id.)  \nPlaintiffsโ experts also opine that there was no probable cause. (Id. at 15โ16.)  \nb.  Plaintiffsโ Motion (Doc. 297) \nEight of the fourteen Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their claims of false arrest, \nfalse imprisonment, and manufacturing evidence against the City and the six individual officers \nwho executed allegedly falsified Affidavits of Probable Cause. (Doc. 297 at 1.)  For these Plaintiffs \n(Imani,  Muhammad,  Pollard,  Nichols,  Cheney,  Onuoha,  Foylin,  and  Liebeskind),  โ(1)  it  is \nestablished that their Affidavit of Probable Cause was wholly fabricated, with no communication \nbetween the arresting officer and the officer who signed the affidavit, and (2) the City cannot \nidentify any officer who saw them commit any alleged crime.โ (Id.)   \n  Plaintiffs maintain that it is well established that criminal defendants have the right to be \nfree from false or fabricated evidence and that the fabrication of same is a due process violation. \n(Doc. 297-1 at 31.)   According to Plaintiffs, Defendants concede that the probable cause affidavits \nmust contain accurate information and that they must show whether the arrest was justified or a \nfalse arrest. (Id. at 32.)  Here, however, it was BRPDโs policy not to transmit information from the \narresting officer to the one executing the affidavits, so the latter had no basis to know if the contents \nwere  true.  (Id.  at  33.)    Indeed,  Plaintiffs  point  out  that  many  officers  invoked  their  Fifth \nAmendment right when asked if they were committing perjury. (Id. at 35.)  Plaintiffs then go \nthrough the various officers that arrested the Plaintiffs at issue and show that these officers lacked \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 67 of 110\nknowledge of the Plaintiffsโ arrests. (Id. at 34โ38.)  Lt. John Clary, a thirty-six year veteran of the \nLouisiana State Police, reviewed the Affidavit of Probable Cause for Pollard and said it was a \ncriminal act for BRPD officers to complete false Affidavits and file them in Court, as is submitting \na false report. (Id. at 38โ39.)  Plaintiffs say Defendants concede that, (1) without the signed \naffidavits, Plaintiffs would be free to go, and (2) Defendants have no evidence of illegal activity \nother than these manufactured probable cause affidavits. (Id. at 39.)    \n  Plaintiffs contend they are entitled to summary judgment. (Id.)  Since no officer allegedly \nwitnessed a Plaintiff committing a crime, they satisfy the requirements of a federal and state false \narrest claim. (Id. at 40.)  Likewise, since probable cause affidavits are required to place someone \nin East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, and since the officers signed the affidavits without any basis \nthat they were true, Plaintiffs are entitled to relief on their false imprisonment claims. (Id.)  Lastly, \nโby creating a document, signing it under oath without any basis, and submitting it to the court, \nDefendants met all the elements of the due process violation of manufacturing false evidence.โ \n(Id.)   Thus, argue Plaintiffs, they should get summary judgment as to each officer who signed the \naffidavit and the City for whom that policy existed. (Id.)   \n  Plaintiffs next assert that, as to Pollard, Savage, and Cheney, their motion should be granted \nagainst the City because the signatures on these affidavits were forged and because the City ratified \nthat forgery. (Id. at 41.)  Plaintiffs highlight that BRPD did not investigate the matter, even after \nofficers were asked about this. (Id. at 42.)  No investigation or administrative review was done on \nthis issue, and no one responded to an officerโs complaint about a forgery. (Id.)  Further, the forged \naffidavits were submitted to the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge and \nnot withdrawn, even after the forgery was discovered. (Id. at 43.)   Plaintiffs contend that the City \nis liable because (1) the City chose not to investigate an issue they believed was a โcause for \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 68 of 110\ninvestigation;โ and (2) the City should be estopped from taking advantage of its failure to \ninvestigate, as the Cityโs conduct prevented these Plaintiffs from knowing which BRPD officer \nsigned and fabricated the probable cause affidavits. (Id.)  โTo hold otherwise would allow BRPD \nto  escape  liability  by  (1)  having  officers  anonymously  forge  documents,  (2)  choosing  not \ninvestigate, and (3) resulting in Plaintiffs not having anyone to hold accountable for the forgery.โ \n(Id.) \n  In response, Defendants begin by incorporating their own motion on these issues. (Doc. \n310 at 11.)  Defendants say, โThe arrests in this case were for standing in the roadway and resisting \narrest, but the primary concern at the command level was the danger of protesters trying to occupy \nthe interstate, which may not have been understood by all of the officers on scene.โ (Id.)  Plaintiffs \nโseize on excess language in the affidavits . . . which does not affect the elements of the offenses \ncharged[.]โ (Id. at 11โ12.)  Defendants assert: \nAs noted in the factual basis, this was an emergency response. There \nwas no plan, because no one saw it coming, and only the rapid \nresponse of officers in the area mitigated this adventure from turning \ninto a tragedy. Mistakes were made, but they were the reasonable \nmistakes of people engaged in the split-second decision making that \nis unique to law enforcement. If an officer saw a transport officer \nbring in a defendant, and mistakenly put the transport officerโs name \non the affidavit of probable cause, that would be a mistake, but a \nreasonable one under the totality of the circumstances, and not the \nperjury or manufacture of false evidence alleged by the plaintiffs. \n \n(Id. at 12.)  The fact that the affidavits had the incorrect location is irrelevant, as that is not required \nfor the simple obstruction of a highway statute. (Id. at 12โ13.)  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs \nfocus exclusively on the protestersโ compliance by getting off of Government and ignore the larger \ndanger that they could occupy I-110, after which time โthe command staff begins mobilizing \nblocking forces to prevent this dangerous activity.โ (Id. at 13.)  โBRPD never changed its mind or \nits position โ from the first dispersal order from the Bearcat to the final push, the message was to \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 69 of 110\nclear the area, disperse, you must leave the area, or you will be arrested.โ (Id.)  Defendants say \nthey were not inconsistent in โwaiting for sufficient manpower to be available to effect arrests \nsafely and [in] delay[ing] [to] clear[ ] the crowd[.]โ (Id.) \n  In reply, Plaintiffs dispute Defendantsโ contention that their response was unplanned, as \nthe City has a โliteral, written plan: a Special Response Team operation plan specific to the July \n10, 2016 protest. (Doc. 323 at 4.)  That written SRT plan detailed where to place units, what \nequipment and EMS resources to deploy, and even codewords in the event of recall or evacuation.โ \n(Id.) That plan involved pre-printed affidavits and mobilized officers. (Id.)  Defendants should \nhave sorted those who were committing crimes and those who were not rather than making mass \narrests. (Id. at 4โ5.)   \nDefendants also fail to dispute that they lacked probable cause and instead only say the \nofficers relied on word of mouth, but โ[t]hose generalities do not help them escape liability at all.โ \n(Id. at 5.)  Plaintiffs here have moved for summary judgment only for those officers who had no \nspecific knowledge as to what any Plaintiff did or did not do. (Id. at 6.)  Finally, Defendants cite \nno case establishing that writing and notarizing a pre-circulated affidavit is a split-second decision \nentitled to deference. (Id.)  In any event, this was not a โhappenstance of a chaotic environment \nthat information was not flowing between seizing officer and affidavit-writing officer: it was \nexplicitly BRPD policy, and Defendants do not argue otherwise.โ (Id. at 6โ7.) \n2. Claims against the Individual Officer Defendants  \na.  Applicable Law \nโThe Fourth Amendment protects โ[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.โ โ Devenpeck v. Alford, \n543 U.S. 146, 152 (2004) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV). A warrantless arrest by a law officer \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 70 of 110\nis unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment if โthere is no probable cause to believe that a crime \nhas been or is being committed.โ Id. (citations omitted). Probable cause exists when the โtotality \nof the facts and circumstancesโ within an officer's knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient \nfor a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an \noffense.โ Glenn v. City of Tyler, 242 F.3d 307, 313 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation and citation \nomitted). โWhether probable cause exists depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn \nfrom the facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.โ Devenpeck, 543 U.S. at 152โ\n53 (citations omitted). โ[A]n arresting officer's state of mind (except for the facts that he knows) \nis irrelevant to the existence of probable cause.โ Id., 543 U.S. at 153 (citations omitted). โThat is \nto say, his subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the \nknown facts provide probable cause.โ Id., 543 U.S. at 153. \nโTo establish a Fourth Amendment claim for false imprisonment, Plaintiffs must prove: \n(1) an intent by Defendants to confine them, (2) acts resulting in confinement, (3) Plaintiffsโ \nconsciousness of confinement or resulting harm, and (4) the deprivation of a constitutional right, \nsuch as the right not to be arrested or detained without probable cause.โ Allen v. Normand, No. 09-\n2825, 2009 WL 2448253, at *13 (E.D. La. Aug. 7, 2009). A plaintiff must establish that the \ndefendant's misconduct exceeds mere negligence. Id.; see also, e.g., Sanchez v. Swyden, 139 F.3d \n464,  469  (5th  Cir.  1998)  (actions  must  go  โbeyond  mere  negligenceโ  before  tort  of  false \nimprisonment โtakes on constitutional dimensionsโ; although plaintiff consistently asserted his \ninnocence and officers were in possession of exculpatory information, there was โconsiderable \ndebateโ about whether plaintiff's appearance matched that of a wanted suspect); Winfrey v. San \nJacinto  Cty.,  481  F.  App'x  969,  980  (5th  Cir.  2012)  (errors  or  omissions  occasioned  by \nโcarelessness or run-of-the-mill negligenceโ do not state a constitutional claim, although those \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 71 of 110\noccasioned by โrecklessnessโ might). โThe โconstitutional tortsโ of false arrest, unreasonable \nseizure, and false imprisonment require a showing of no probable cause.โ Brown v. Lyford, 243 \nF.3d 185, 189 (5th Cir. 2001). \nFurther, โthe right of criminal defendants to be free from false or fabricated evidence was \nwell settled by 1959 or earlierโ. Brown v. Miller, 519 F.3d 231, 237 (5th Cir. 2008).  Thus, for \nexample, in Brown, the Fifth Circuit held โthat the deliberate or knowing creation of a misleading \nand scientifically inaccurate serology report amounts to a violation of a defendant's due process \nrights, and that a reasonable laboratory technician in 1984 would have understood that those \nactions violated those rights.โ Id. (finding no error in denial of qualified immunity on this theory). \nRelevant here, under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), โan officer violates the \nFourth  Amendment  by  intentionally  or  recklessly  including  a  false  statement  in  a  warrant \napplication.โ Nerio v. Evans, 974 F.3d 571, 577 (5th Cir. 2020).  โLiability under Franks requires \na certain mindset and certain conduct: an officer must intentionally, or with a reckless disregard \nfor the truth, include a false statement in a warrant application or omit a material fact from it.โ Id. \n(cleaned up).  There is no liability for โan honest mistake.โ Id. (citation omitted). \nb.  Analysis  \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny both motions.  The Court will \naddress each motion in turn. \nFirst, Defendantsโ motion is easily denied.  Again, Plaintiffsโ chart, as verified by the Rule \n30(b)(6) deposition, reflects (1) that Defendants have no evidence that Plaintiffs failed to comply \nwith orders or that any Plaintiff engaged in an act of violence, and (2) that, other than the Affidavits \nof Probable Cause (which many times were made without personal knowledge), the City does not \nhave any description of any specific Plaintiff's illegal activity. (Rule 30(b)(6) Chart, Doc. 292-1 at \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 72 of 110\n1; Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 26:19โ27:8, 36:21โ37:4, Doc. 292-2; DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. 311.)  Moreover, \nthe chart also shows that, with a few exceptions, the City had no knowledge of which officer saw \nPlaintiffs commit any crime or of what officer seized Plaintiffs. (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 42:21โ43:18, \n45:4โ9, Doc. 292-2.)  A reasonable juror could easily look at this evidence and find that Plaintiffs \nhave created questions of fact on the existence of probable cause so as to preclude summary \njudgment in favor of Defendants on the false arrest and imprisonment claims. \nPlaintiffsโ motion is a closer call, but denial is still warranted; while Plaintiffs cite \nconsiderable evidence supporting a finding of wrongdoing by the police as to the Plaintiffs at issue, \nthe Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude, when construing the evidence in a light most \nfavorable to Defendants and drawing reasonable inferences in their favor, that these officers are \nentitled to qualified immunity. \nPlaintiffs cite to the law governing Franks liability generally and the prohibition of \nprophylactically stopping the exercise of First Amendment rights, but Plaintiffs have not provided \nโcontrolling authorityโor a robust consensus of persuasive authorityโthat defines the contours \nof the right in question with a high degree of particularity,โ see McLin, 866 F.3d at 696 (cleaned \nup), for the factual situation as presented by Defendants: where officers executed Affidavits of \nProbable Cause without specific knowledge of the underlying crime but where those officers (1) \nwere aware that protests were taking place, (Willie Williams Dep. 16:25โ17:6, 74:7โ75:15, Doc. \n292-24; see also Jonathan Abadie Dep. 11:24โ12:3, 35:8โ22, Doc. 292-7); (2) knew of the โchaos, \nconfusion, cutting up,โ and โacts of violenceโ of protesters and their โgoing haywire,โ and knew \nof the protestersโ obstructing traffic at the relevant location, (Willie Williams Dep. 20:14โ23:9, \n74:7โ75:15, Doc. 292-24); (3) then acted on good faith reliance of officers and the information \nprovided to them, (Willie Williams Dep. 41:18โ42:9, 46:14โ20, 79:1โ8, Doc. 292-24; Jonathan \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 73 of 110\nAbadie Dep. 35:8โ22, 55:1โ7, Doc. 292-7); and (4) did so where there was a risk that the protest \nwould venture onto the interstate, thereby endangering the public and preventing the flow of \ntraffic, all as detailed above. \nEven if Defendants were wrong or ignorant about these specific nine Plaintiffs, the Court \ncannot  say  that  โthe  law  so  clearly  and  unambiguously  prohibited  [their]  conduct  that \nevery reasonable  official  would  understand  that  what  [they  were]  doing  violate[d]  [the \nlaw].โ McLin, 866 F.3d at 695.  And the Court certainly cannot say that the โrecord is so one-sided \nas to rule out the prospect of the [Defendants] prevailingโ Kane, supra, at ยง 2727.1, or that \nPlaintiffs are entitled to judgment โbeyond peradventure,โ see Fontenot, 780 F.2d at 1194.   \nIn sum, construing the facts from Defendantsโ perspective (as the Court must do for \nPlaintiffsโ  motion),  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  provide  โcontrolling  authority  specifically \nprohibit[ing] [ ] [D]efendant[sโ] conductโ so as to overcome qualified immunity. See McLin, 866 \nF.3d at 695.  At the very least, a reasonable jury could find in Defendantsโ favor, so Plaintiffsโ \nmotion must be denied. \n3. Claims Against the City \na.  Applicable Law \nโSection 1983 offers no respondeat superior liability.โ Pineda v. City of Houston, 291 F.3d \n325, 328 (5th Cir. 2002). โMunicipalities face ยง 1983 liability โwhen execution of a government's \npolicy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be \nsaid to represent official policy, inflicts the injury. . . .โ โ Id. (quoting Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. \nof City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978)). That is, โ[a] municipality is liable only for acts \ndirectly attributable to it โthrough some official action or imprimatur.โ โ Valle v. City of Houston, \n613 F.3d 536, 541 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 74 of 110\nCir. 2001)). โTo establish municipal liability under ยง 1983, a plaintiff must show the deprivation \nof a federally protected right caused by action taken โpursuant to an official municipal policy.โ \nโ Id. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 691). The Plaintiff must allege โ(1) an official policy (or \ncustom), of which (2) a policymaker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and \n(3) a constitutional violation whose โmoving forceโ is that policy or custom.โ Id. at 541โ42 \n(cleaned up). \nAs to the first two prongs, โ[m]unicipalities can also be liable, in certain situations, for \nsingle episodes of conduct that are not part of any pattern of illegality.โ Milam v. City of San \nAntonio, 113 F. App'x 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 405โ06 (1997) (summarizing the Court's single-episode cases)). โFor example, plaintiffs can \nhold  municipalities  liable  for  single  instances  of  conduct  perpetrated  by  the  policymakers \nthemselves;  such  one-time  conduct  can  represent  official  โpolicyโ  even  though  it  does  not \nnecessarily form part of a plan or rule developed to govern all like occasions.โ Id. (citing Pembaur \nv. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480โ81, 484โ85 (1986) (finding that court of appeals erred in \ndismissing petitionerโs claim against a county when the prosecutor, the relevant final policymaker, \nโmade a considered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the officers \nforcibly  to  enter  petitionerโs  clinic,โ  and  โ[t]hat  decision  directly  caused  the  violation  of \npetitionerโs Fourth Amendment rights.โ)). \nโThe third prong requires a plaintiff to prove โmoving forceโ causation.โ Valle, 613 F.3d at \n542. โTo succeed, โa plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite \ndegree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and \nthe deprivation of federal rights.โ โ Id. (quoting Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 404 (1997)). โThat is, โthe plaintiff must demonstrate that a municipal decision reflects \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 75 of 110\ndeliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right \nwill follow the decision.โ โ Id. (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 411). โDeliberate indifference is a high \nstandardโโa  showing  of  simple  or  even  heightened  negligence  will  not  suffice.โ \nโ Id. (quoting Piotrowski, 237 F.3d at 579). \nAdditionally, โPlaintiffs must meet a heightened standard of causation in order to hold a \nmunicipality liable under ยง 1983.โ Id. at 546 (citing City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, \n391โ92 (1989)). Plaintiffs must show that the municipal policy was the โ โmoving forceโ that \ncaused the specific constitutional violation.โ Id. (citing Brown v. Bryan Cty, Okl., 219 F.3d 450, \n461 (5th Cir. 2000)). โIn other words, the plaintiff must establish a โdirect causal linkโ between the \nmunicipal policy and the constitutional injury.โ Id. (citing Brown, 520 U.S. at 404). \nโThe Supreme Court has [also] explained that a municipality cannot be liable โ[i]f a person \nhas suffered no constitutional injury at the hands of the individual police officer.โ โ Bustos v. \nMartini Club Inc., 599 F.3d 458, 467 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 \nU.S. 796, 799 (1986)). Thus, official capacity โclaims fail without an underlying constitutional \nviolation.โ Whitley v. Hanna, 726 F.3d 631, 648โ49 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Bustos, 599 F.3d at 467 \n(โBecause [plaintiff] has alleged no constitutional injury attributable to the Officers, [plaintiff] has \nfailed  to  state  a  claim  that  a  City  policy  was  the  moving  force  behind  a  violation  of  his \nconstitutional rights.โ)).  \nMoreover, an authorized policymaker approves a subordinate's decision and the basis for \nit, such ratification is chargeable to the government entity. See City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 \nU.S. 112, 127 (1988). However, the Fifth Circuit has limited the theory of ratification to โextreme \nfactual situations.โ Peterson, 588 F.3d 838, 848 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Snyder v. Trepagnier, \n142 F.3d 791, 798 (5th Cir. 1998)). \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 76 of 110\nFurther, the Fifth Circuit has โexplained that a policymaker who defends conduct that is \nlater  shown  to  be  unlawful  does  not  necessarily  incur  liability  on  behalf  of  the \nmunicipality.โ Id. (citing Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1161โ62 (5th Cir. 1986)); Zarnow v. \nCity of Wichita Falls, 614 F.3d 161, 169 (5th Cir. 2010) (โGood faith statements made in defending \ncomplaints against municipal employees do not demonstrate ratification.โ). \nIn Peterson, the Fifth Circuit explained: \nIn City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, a case on which [plaintiff] relies \n[and which is the basis of ratification liability], the Supreme Court \nemphasized that โ[s]imply going along with discretionary decisions \nmade by one's subordinates, however, is not a delegation to them of \nthe authority to make policy. . . .โ [485 U.S. 112, 130 (1988)]. \nAdditionally,  โthe  mere  failure  to  investigate  the  basis  of  a \nsubordinate's  discretionary  decisions  does  not  amount  to  a \ndelegation of policymaking authority. . . .โ Id. See also Kibbe v. City \nof Springfield, 777 F.2d 801, 809 n.7 (1st Cir. 1985) (โThe [district] \ncourt suggested that the City had ratified defendant Perry's action by \nclearing him and finding that he had acted in accordance with the \npolice department's policies. We are unconvinced that a failure to \ndiscipline Perry or other officers amounts to the sort of ratification \nfrom which a jury properly could infer municipal policy.โ). \n \n588 F.3d at 848 n.2. See also Milam v. City of San Antonio, 113 F. App'x 622, 627 (5th Cir. 2004) \n(quoting to the same propositions from Praprotnik and explaining that โ[s]uch limitations on \nmunicipal liability are necessary to prevent the ratification theory from becoming a theory \nof respondeat superior, which theory Monell does not countenanceโ). Furthermore, the Fifth \nCircuit has held that โ[i]t is nearly impossible to impute lax disciplinary policy to [a governmental \nentity] without showing a pattern of abuses that transcends the error made in a single case.โ Quinn \nv. Guerrero, 863 F.3d 353, 365 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Piotrowski, 237 F.3d at 582) (affirming \nthe district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's excessive force claim against a police department). \n \n \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 77 of 110\nb.  Analysis \nAgain, Plaintiffs have strong evidence against the City on these claims.  This includes the \npreprinted affidavits themselves (some, relevant here, executed by officers without personal \nknowledge, and some, also relevant here, executed by officers who say they did not sign the \naffidavits), (see PRDSMF ยถยถ 26โ27, Doc. 309-1 at 7); the application of the Civil Disorder Policy \nfor content-based reasons, (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 28:2โ29:3, Doc. 292-25); and the fact that it was \nโBRPD policy that the arrest team should not stop and have a conversation with the processing \nteamโ and that โ[t]hey should simply hand off the arrestee and return to the front lines[,]โ (id. at \n74:12โ17).  Considering all of this, a reasonable jury could easily find the City liable. \nHowever, when considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the City and drawing \nreasonable inferences in its favor (as the Court must do on Plaintiffsโ motion), for similar reasons \ncataloged aboveโthe threat of the interstate being overrun, thereby creating a danger to both the \nprotesters and the public and obstruction of traffic; the concern for officer safety (as reflected by \nthe thrown water bottles); and the considerable evidence of Plaintiffs being in the street after \nnumerous  orders  to  disperse,  given  throughout  their  demonstration,  the  Court  finds  that  a \nreasonable jury could conclude that the City was not deliberately indifferent so as to subject it to \nMonell liability.  That is, the Court cannot say that Plaintiffs have established they are entitled to \nrelief โbeyond peradventureโ or โbeyond doubt.โ  See Fontenot, 780 F.2d at 1194.   \nFurther, a reasonable jury could find, when looking at the facts from the Defendantsโ \nperspective, that this is not the sort of โextreme factual situation[]โ that satisfies the requirements \nfor ratification. See Snyder, 142 F.3d at 798 (finding that the shooting of a fleeing suspect in the \nback โhardly [rose] toโ such a level, โparticularly given the absence of evidence suggesting a \nculture of recklessness in the NOPDโ). Cf. Grandstaff v. City of Borger, 767 F.2d 161 (5th \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 78 of 110\nCir.1985) (finding ratification after officers โpouredโ gunfire onto a vehicle and killed innocent \noccupant).  This is particularly true given the facts that (1) the mere failure to investigate does not \ngenerally give rise to liability for ratification, see Peterson, 588 F.3d at 848 n.2; (2) โ[i]t is nearly \nimpossible to impute lax disciplinary policy to [a governmental entity] without showing a pattern \nof abuses that transcends the error made in a single case,โ Quinn, 863 F.3d at 365, a showing which \nhas not been made here; and (3) โit is hard to see how a policymaker's ineffectual or nonexistent \nresponse to an incident, which occurs well after the fact of the constitutional deprivation, could \nhave caused the deprivation.โ Milam, 113 F. Appโx at 628 (cleaned up). \nUltimately, reasonable minds could differ on the Cityโs liability for these claims, and that \nis exactly why the jury must decide it.   Consequently, Plaintiffsโ motion will be denied. \nF.  Search and Seizure \n1. Partiesโ Arguments  \nDefendants next move for dismissal of Plaintiffsโ claims that Defendants violated their \nrights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.  (Doc. 307-1 at 15.)  Defendants assert, \nโThe officers knew that the protest had been going on for an extended time, and the public address \nsystem on the BRPD vehicle giving orders to disperse was audible at a long distance. When the \nplaintiffs were seized, the standoff was over.โ (Id. at 16.)  โOther plaintiffs claim to have been \nsearched for weapons, but no excessive search is pled in the Third Amended Complaint.โ (Id.) \nPlaintiffs respond, โAlthough reasonable suspicion to search is a lower bar than probable \ncause to arrest, the searches and seizures only occurred because of the decision to mass arrest \nprotesters. That should never have occurred and, therefore, the search and seizure was based on \nthe same flawed logic.โ (Doc. 309 at 16.) \n \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 79 of 110\n2.

Courts consider only the โinformation available to the \nofficer[s] at the time of the decision to stop a person.โ Id. at 691 (citations omitted).  Further, โit \nis appropriate for the police to take into account the location of the suspicious conduct and the \ndegree of the potential danger being investigated. What is not suspicious in one location may be \nhighly suspicious in another.โ Id. at 692 (cleaned up).  โFinally, the Supreme Court has emphasized \nthat courts must allow law enforcement officers to draw on their own experience and specialized \ntraining to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to \nthem that โmight well elude an untrained person.โ United States v. Brigham, 382 F.3d 500, 507 \n(5th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (cleaned up). But, โin determining whether the officer acted reasonably \nin such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized \nsuspicion or โhunch,โ but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from \nthe facts in light of his experience.โ  Terry, 392 U.S. at 27. \nThe Court must โconsider each of [the relevant] factors in turnโ and โconsider whether \nthese factors constitute specific and articulable facts which, when considered along with whatever \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 80 of 110\nreasonable inferences may be drawn from them, would allow a reasonable person to suspect that \n[the plaintiffs were] engaging in illegal activity.โ United States v. Lopez-Moreno, 420 F.3d 420, \n433  (5th  Cir.  2005)  (citation  omitted).  The  Court  must  โpay  heed  to  the  Supreme  Court's \nadmonition not to treat each factor in isolation, but rather to give due regard to the totality of the \ncircumstances.โ Id. (citations omitted). \nAdditionally, โ[o]ne . . . exception to the warrant requirement exists for searches incident \nto a lawful arrest.โ United States v. Ho, 94 F.3d 932, 935 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. \nBarlow, 17 F.3d 85, 89 (5th Cir. 1994)).  โA warrantless arrest must be based on probable cause.โ  \nIf an officer lacked probable cause, and if the arrest is invalid, that search is unlawful under the \nFourth Amendment. See id.   \nFurther, the law โpermit[s] a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police \nofficer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, \nregardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.โ Terry, 392 U.S. \nat 27.  โThe officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether \na reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or \nthat of others was in danger.โ Id.   \n3. Analysis  \nThe Court finds that Defendantsโ motion is easily denied, for much the same reasons that \nwere given in the preceding sections.  Even taking into account the fact that the Terry standard is \nlower than probable cause, there is simply too much conflicting evidence on whether Plaintiffs \ncommitted any violations, (see Rule 30(b)(6) Chart, Doc. 292-1 at 1; Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 26:19โ\n27:8, 36:21โ37:4, Doc. 292-2; DRPSMF ยถ 12, Doc. 311), and what the officers knew and did not \n80 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 81 of 110\nknow, (see, e.g., PRDSMF ยถยถ 26โ27, Doc. 309-1 at 7), to justify summary judgment on any of \nthese claims.  Consequently, Defendantsโ motion will be denied.  \nG. Excessive Force  \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nDefendants next turn to the excessive force claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 16โ17.)  Defendants say \nthat โno significant injury was sufferedโ by Plaintiffs. (Id. at 16.)   Moreover, there is little causal \nlink between the alleged injuries and officersโ conduct. (Id.)  โThe exhibits presented show \nminimal force being used, without strikes, hard empty hand technique, use of batons or chemical \nsprays, no Tasers were fired, and no firearms were discharged.โ (Id. at 16โ17)  The LRAD \ncomplained of was ineffective, and the officers gave up on using it. (Id. at 17.)  Thus, any excessive \nforce claim fails. (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs respond that they need only show more than de minimis injury, and they have \nshown much more than that. (Doc. 309 at 16.)  Plaintiffs then quote the injuries described in the \noperative complaint and say that these injuries are supported by Plaintiffsโ experts. (Id. at 16โ17.)   \nPlaintiffs also dispute Defendantsโ position that the LRAD was ineffective, as these devices โcan \ncause migraines, sinus pain, dizziness, facial pressure, ringing in ears, sensitivity to noise, tinnitus, \nand hearing loss and has been found to be a potential basis for an excessive force claim.โ (Id. at \n17.)  Plaintiffsโ expert opines that this device may have caused injury. (Id. at 18.)  \n2. Applicable Law \nโTo prevail on an excessive force claim, a plaintiff must establish: โ(1) injury (2) which \nresulted directly and only from a use of force that was clearly excessive, and (3) the excessiveness \nof which was clearly unreasonable.โ โ Freeman v.

(quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396). โThis list is not exclusive, however, and the Court may \nexamine the totality of the circumstances.โ Drumgole v. Frumveller, No. 14-2827, 2015 WL \n2250134, at *8 (E.D. La. May 13, 2015). \nAs  to  the  first  prong,  โthe  plaintiff's  asserted  injury  must  be  more  than de \nminimis.โ Freeman, 483 F.3d at 416 (citing Glenn v. City of Tyler, 242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir. \n2001).  โThe  determination  of  whether  a  plaintiff's  alleged  injury  is  sufficient  to  support \nan excessive force claim is context-dependent and is โdirectly related to the amount of force that \nis constitutionally permissible under the circumstances.โ โ Id. at 416โ17 (quoting Ikerd v. Blair, \n101 F.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir. 1996) and citing Williams v.

Bramer, 180 F.3d 699, 703 (5th Cir. 1999)); see also Keele \nv. Leyva, 69 F. App'x 659, 2003 WL 21356063, at *1 (5th Cir. 2003) (unpublished) (per curiam) \n(โThe injury must be more than a de minimis physical injury, but need not be significant or \n82 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 83 of 110\nserious.โ (citing Gomez v. Chandler, 163 F.3d 921, 924 (5th Cir. 1999)). Elaborating on this, the \nFifth Circuit said recently: \nโ[A]lthough a de minimis injury is not cognizable, the extent of \ninjury necessary to satisfy the injury requirement is โdirectly related \nto the amount of force that is constitutionally permissible under the \ncircumstances.โ โ Brown v. Lynch, 524 Fed. Appx. 69, 79 (5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting Ikerd v. Blair, 101 F.3d 430, 434โ35 (5th Cir. \n1996)). โAny force found to be objectively unreasonable necessarily \nexceeds  the  de  minimis  threshold,  and,  conversely,  objectively \nreasonable  force  will  result  in  de  minimis  injuries  only.โ  Id. \n(emphasis  added)  (footnote  omitted).  Consequently,  โonly  one \ninquiry is required to determine whether an officer used excessive \nforce in violation of the Fourth Amendment.โ Ikerd, 101 F.3d at 434 \nn.9. In short, โas long as a plaintiff has suffered โsome injury,โ even \nrelatively insignificant injuries and purely psychological injuries \nwill prove cognizable when resulting from an officer's unreasonably \nexcessive force.โ Brown, 524 Fed. Appx. at 79 (footnotes omitted) \n(quoting Ikerd, 101 F.3d at 434). \n \nAlexander v. City of Round Rock, 854 F.3d 298, 309 (5th Cir. 2017). \n  As to the second prongโthat the injury โresulted directly and only from a use of force that \nwas clearly excessive,โ Freeman, 483 F.3d at 416โthe Fifth Circuit โdistinguish[es] between \ninjuries resulting from excessive force and those resulting from the justified use of force.โ Dunn \nv. Denk, 79 F.3d 401, 403 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (citation omitted).  โA trier of the fact can \ncompensate only for injury caused by the use of excessive force. There can be no award for injury \ncaused by reasonable force.โ Id.  Thus, there is no bar to โrecovery for aggravation of preexisting \ninjury caused by the use of excessive force.โ Id.  \n3. Analysis  \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion.  The heart \nof this motion is that (1) Plaintiffs did not suffer sufficient injury and (2) any injury was not caused \nby the police response. \n83 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 84 of 110\nBut Defendants readily concede in their recitation of Plaintiffsโ interrogatories that all \nPlaintiffs suffered some emotional stress and trauma arising from the incident, as reflected in the \noperative complaint. (See Doc. 307-1 at 5โ9.)  And, again, โAny force found to be objectively \nunreasonable necessarily exceeds the de minimis threshold. . . [A]s long as a plaintiff has suffered \nโsome injury,โ even relatively insignificant injuries and purely psychological injuries will prove \ncognizable when resulting from an officer's unreasonably excessive force.โ Alexander, 854 F.3d \nat 309 (cleaned up).  Thus, the key question is whether Plaintiffs suffered objectively unreasonable \nforce. \nA reasonable jury could find that they did.  Again, the Court must consider the totality of \nthe circumstances in evaluating whether force was excessive, including โthe severity of the crime \nat issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and \nwhether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.โ Deville, 567 F.3d at \n167 (cleaned up).  Here, the crimes were all non-violent misdemeanors, and the City has conceded \nthrough Plaintiffsโ chart (cited numerous times above) that no Plaintiff engaged in any act of \nviolence.  Thus, questions of fact preclude summary judgment. \nThis conclusion is bolstered by the testimony of Plaintiffsโ experts.  After reviewing the \nAffidavits of Probable Cause, the BRPD Incident Report, various declarations, and numerous \nphotos and videos, Robert Pusins stated that โ[m]any Plaintiffs were injuredโ and ultimately \nopined: \nIn this case, there is no evidence or reporting in any of the police \nreports or otherwise that would lead a reasonably trained officer to \nconclude that each application of force against each Plaintiff was \nreasonable under the totality of circumstances. The allegations in the \nComplaint, if true, would be evidence that not only was force used \nagainst  the  Plaintiffs  but  in  many  cases  as  noted,  especially \ninvolving the intentional tightening of the flex cuffs, the force was \nretaliatory in nature, was not intended to accomplish a reasonable \n84 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 85 of 110\nand legitimate law enforcement objective but was intentionally used \nwith malice designed to injure and cause pain. \n \nAbsent any articulable justification for each application of force, I \nmust conclude that the use of force against the noted Plaintiffs was \nunreasonable,  not  consistent  with  generally  accepted  police \npractices regarding the use of force and a violation of the BRPD \nGeneral Order regarding the use of force. \n \n(Pusins Report, Doc. 309-2 at 3, 48โ49.)  Likewise, Dr. Kraska, opined, โIn sum, there appeared \nto be no discernable justification for using force on these [protesters] and arresting them.โ (Kraska \nReport, Doc. 309-3 at 6.) \nPlaintiffsโ expert Pusins also focuses on the LRAD as a source of excessive force.  Pusins \nquotes one publication that explains how โ[s]ound cannons are used to emit painful, loud sounds \nthat have the potential to cause significant harm to the eardrums and delicate organs of the ears \nand/or cause hearing loss.โ (Pusins Report, Doc. 309-2 at 53 (quoting โLethal in Disguise, the \nHealth Consequences of Crowd Control Weapons,โ Physicians for Human Rights, March 2016 \n(โPHRโ)).)  Further, โManufacturer guidelines indicate that sound cannons should only be used \nfrom at least a 10-20 metre distance.โ (Id. (quoting PHR, supra).)  The article states: \nThere  are  very  serious  concerns  about  acoustic  weaponsโ  high \npotential to cause serious and permanent injury, such as hearing loss, \nand the inherent inability of such systems to prevent bystanders and \neven law enforcement officials from being affected. These concerns \nare exacerbated by the lack of proper research and evidence about \nthe health effects of acoustic weapons. For these reasons, the use of \nacoustic weapons in crowd-control situations should be suspended, \nat least until such concerns are addressed. \n \n(Id. (quoting PHR, supra).)  Pusins then ties this research to the events in question: \nReasonably  well-trained  officers  know  and  understand  that  the \nsound waves from โalertโ feature from a LRAD can cause pain and \ninjury  and  its  target  use  is  indiscriminate  in  that  protesters, \nbystanders, the media, and even police officers can be exposed to \nthe hazardous effects of the LRAD. The footage of the various \n85 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 86 of 110\nrecordings of the BRPD using the LRAD shows protesters and \npolice officers in close proximity to the LRAD vehicle. \n \n(Id.)  He concludes: \n  \nIt is my opinion that the use of the LRAD on July 10, 2016 by the \nBRPD was unreasonable as protesters and police officers were in \nclose proximity to the device and may have suffered pain and injury \nas a result and that the BRPD does not have a policy or training on \nthe use of the LRAD and potential harmful effects and this is not \nconsistent with generally accepted police practices regarding the use \nof an LRAD. The BRPD should have a comprehensive LRAD \npolicy that addresses the issues just discussed. \n \n(Id. at 54.)   \nPlaintiffs also provide other evidence that the LRAD led to excessive force.  Plaintiffs \nhighlight how โBRPD had not done . . . any training or investigation into the safety use of this \nLRAD device in a manner to prevent injury,โ (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. 142:15โ21, Doc. 292-25), and \nhow BRPD had not received any training or instruction before using the device about โhow close \nto someone the device should be safely used.โ (Id. at 138:2โ7.)   The Cityโs representative did not \nโhave any knowledge as to what decibel level the device was used in less-than-lethal weapon mode \non protesters on East and France,โ and the City did not โknow anything about that device, how \nclose to people it could be safely used, at what decibel it could be safely used or at what decibel \nlevel it was actually [ ] used on people[.]โ (Id. at 138:15โ139:5.)  This testimony bolsters the \nopinions provided by Pusins.   \nThe City submits contrary evidence.  Specifically, the Cityโs representative testified that, \nbecause the LRAD was sitting on top of the Bearcat, it was elevated so that the โhorrible noiseโ \nwas projecting over the crowd, โ[a]nd thatโs why it wasnโt effective.โ (Id. at 140:24โ142:14.)  But, \nultimately, this is merely a factual dispute that must be resolved at trial. \n86 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 87 of 110\nIn sum, considering all of this evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing \nreasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable juror could conclude that excessive force was \nused against Plaintiffs which caused more than de minimis injury.  Consequently, Defendantsโ \nmotion on these claims will be denied.  \nH. Failure to Intervene \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nDefendants next attack the failure to intervene claims.  (Doc. 307-1 at 17.)  Defendants say \nthat there was no First Amendment violation and therefore no duty to intervene. (Id. at 18.)  \nFurther, the searches, seizures, and arrests were also supported by probable cause. (Id)  Finally, \nthe officers were trained in their duty to intervene. (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs  respond  that  โDefendants  argue  only  that  there  were  no  underlying  legal \nviolations for officers to intervene against.โ (Doc. 309 at 18.)  โBut as described above, in \nPlaintiffsโ Motion for Summary Judgment, and in both expert reports, there is abundant evidence \nof Defendantsโ constitutional violations.โ (Id.)   \n2. Applicable Law \nโ[A]n officer who is present at the scene and does not take reasonable measures to protect \na suspect from another officer's use of excessive force may be liable under section 1983.โ Hale v. \nTownley, 45 F.3d 914, 919 (5th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). โ[A]n officer may be liable under ยง \n1983 under [this] theory of bystander liability where the officer โ(1) knows that a fellow officer is \nviolating an individual's constitutional rights; (2) has a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm; \nand (3) chooses not to act.โ โ Whitley v.

Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny Defendants relief.  The Court \nagrees with Plaintiffsโ assessment: the sole basis for Defendantsโ motion is that there is no \nunderlying constitutional violation.9  But this Court has already concluded that there are numerous \nquestions of fact on each of Plaintiffsโ federal claims.  As a result, Defendantsโ motion on this \nissue will be denied. \nI.  Civil Conspiracy \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nDefendants next attack the conspiracy claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 18โ19.)  Defendants say \nPlaintiffsโ claims are โcolorful and hyperbolic, but there is an absence of proof[.]โ (Id at 19.)  \nFurther, J.D. Leach and former Chief Dabadie both testified that there was no conspiracy and that \nthe โsupervisory levelโ defendants were disconnected from the events on the ground. (Id.)  โThe \ntotality of the exhibits and deposition testimony show that this was ordinary police work, an effort \n \n9 The Court notes that all other arguments based on the above bystander liability law have been waived for this motion. \nSee JTB Tools & Oilfield Servs., 831 F.3d at 601; Wuestenhoefer, 105 F. Supp. 3d at 672; Byrd, 2022 WL 879492, at \n*13.   \n \n90 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 91 of 110\nto keep peace on the streets of the city, that the plaintiffs were ordered to disperse and refused to \ndo so, resulting in their arrests.โ (Id.) \nPlaintiffs respond, โDefendants argue that Plaintiffsโ civil conspiracy claims should be \ndismissed because two Defendants say there was no conspiracy. Two Defendantsโ contentions are \nan insufficient basis to deny all civil conspiracy claims.โ (Doc. 309 at 19.)  Plaintiffs rely on (1) \nthe meetings in the days leading up to the protest to coordinate a response; (2) Defendantsโ decision \nto use the Civil Disorder Policy which mandated disbursal; (3) the use of Affidavits of Probable \nCause that were written and printed before the protest; (4) the circulation of those affidavits via \nemail to BRPD supervisors and approval of same; and (5) the instruction on the radio that \nโEveryone has violated. Everyone is under arrest. Those who can safely apprehend violators must \ndo so.โ (Id.)  โOther officers agreed and began making mass, indiscriminate arrests regardless of \nwhat protesters were doing and where they were standing.โ (Id.)  Thus, say Plaintiffs, Defendantsโ \nmotion should be denied.  \n2. Applicable Law \nโA conspiracy may be charged under section 1983 as the legal mechanism through which \nto impose liability on all of the defendants without regard to who committed the particular act.โ \nHale v. Townley, 45 F.3d 914, 920 (5th Cir. 1995) (cleaned up).  โTo prevail on a conspiracy claim \nunder ยง 1983, the plaintiffs must show (1) the existence of a conspiracy involving state action and \n(2) a deprivation of their civil rights in furtherance of the conspiracy.โ Plaisance v. Reese, 353 F. \nSupp. 2d 735, 738 (E.D. La. 2004). \nAs to the first, plaintiff must bring forward โfacts tending to show that the defendants \nentered into an agreement to deprive him of his [rights].โ Leggett v. Williams, 277 F. App'x 498, \n91 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 92 of 110\n501 (5th Cir. 2008).  โ[A] conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence.โ Mack v. Newton, \n737 F.2d 1343, 1350 (5th Cir. 1984) (citations omitted).  Indeed,  \nSince conspiracies . . . are rarely evidenced by explicit agreements, \nthe determination of whether a conspiracy existed almost inevitably \nrests on the inferences that may fairly be drawn from the behavior \nof the alleged conspirators. At a minimum, their actions, to support \na finding of a conspiracy, must suggest a commitment to a common \nend. The circumstances must be such as to warrant a jury in finding \nthat the conspirators had a unity of purpose or a common design and \nunderstanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement. \n \nId. (cleaned up).   \nBut, โa mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury.โ Id. \n(cleaned up).  Unreasonable inferences, speculation, and conjecture are also inadequate. See id. \nโMere conclusory allegations of conspiracy cannot, absent reference to material facts, state a \nsubstantial claim of federal conspiracy under 42 U.S.C.A. ยง 1983.โ Leggett, 277 F. App'x at 501 \n(citing Hale v. Harney, 786 F.2d 688, 690 (5th Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nAs to the second, โa conspiracy claim is not actionable without an actual violation of \nsection 1983.โ Hale, 45 F.3d at 920.  Thus, if all members of the conspiracy are entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the underlying constitutional violation, then a โconspiracy claim is not actionable.โ \nId. \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3), entitled โDepriving Persons of Rights or Privileges,โ provides: \nIf two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire . . .  for the \npurpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or \nclass of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal \nprivileges and immunities under the laws; . . .  in any case of \nconspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged \ntherein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object \nof such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or \nproperty, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege \nof a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may \nhave an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such \ninjury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators. \n92 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 93 of 110\n \n  โSection 1985(3) prohibits conspiracies to deprive any person equal protection of the \nlaws.โ  Body by Cook, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 869 F.3d 381, 389 (5th Cir. 2017), cert. \ndenied, 138 S. Ct. 1009 (2018), reh'g denied, No. 17-892, 2018 WL 1786091 (U.S. Apr. 16, 2018) \n(citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3); Lockett v. New Orleans City, 607 F.3d 992, 1002 (5th Cir. 2010)). To \nestablish a claim under ยง 1985(3), a plaintiff must demonstrate โ(1) a conspiracy; (2) for the \npurpose of depriving a person of the equal protection of the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of \nthe conspiracy; (4) which causes injury to a person or a deprivation of any right or privilege of a \ncitizen of the United States.โ โ Id. (quoting Lockett, 607 F.3d at 1002).   \nโTo state a cognizable claim under ยง 1985(3), [Plaintiffs] must allege that (1) a racial or \nclass-based discriminatory animus lay behind the conspiracy and (2) the conspiracy aimed to \nviolate rights protected against private infringement.โ Horaist v. Doctor's Hosp. of Opelousas, 255 \nF.3d 261, 270 (5th Cir. 2001).  โ โIn this circuit, [courts] require an allegation of a race-based \nconspiracyโ to present a claim under ยง 1985(3).โ Id. at 271 (citing Bryan v. City of Madison, 213 \nF.3d 267, 276 (5th Cir. 2000)).  Plaintiffs must show โracial animus,โ or else their ยง 1985(3) claims \nfail. Id. (affirming dismissal of ยง 1985(3) claim on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds); see also Lockett, 607 \nF.3d at 1002 (the ยง 1985(3) โconspiracy must also have a racially based animusโ).    \n  Like ยง 1983 conspiracy claims, a party asserting a ยง 1985(3) claim must demonstrate โan \nagreement among the alleged co-conspirators.โ Body by Cook, 869 F.3d at 389 (citing Green v. \nState Bar of Tex., 27 F.3d 1083, 1089 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Plaintiffs must do so with specificity, and \nthey may not rely on mere conclusory allegations. See Holdiness v. Stroud, 808 F.2d 417, 424 (5th \nCir. 1987) (quoted with approval by Body by Cook, 869 F.3d at 389โ90).   \n \n \n93 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 94 of 110\n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion.  Again, \nquestions of fact preclude summary judgment. \nDefendantsโ sole argument is that there is insufficient evidence of an agreement, but \nPlaintiffs submit proof from which the inference can be drawn that there was in fact a meeting of \nthe minds.  Plaintiffs point to the Cityโs decision to use the Civil Disorder Policy because โit was \na protest for them to speak out against perceived misconduct by the [BRPD.]โ  (Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. \n28:2โ24, Doc. 292-25.)  Plaintiffs also refer to the โBRPD policy to target identified leaders and \nagitators,โ  (id.  at  35:17โ19),  the  latter  of  which  are  defined  by  BRPD  to  mean  โPersons \nencouraging others to upset the status quo to further their cause,โ including those who โwant to \nsee a major change in the politics of Baton Rouge.โ (Id. at 35:20โ36:3, 38:2โ13.)  Thus, the use of \nthese policies reflects an agreement by BRPD leadership and officers in their response to the \nprotest. \nThis  agreement  is  further  demonstrated  by  the  fact  that  pre-printed  and  pre-drafted \nAffidavits of Probable Cause were used. (See, e.g., Doc. 307-5.)  These affidavits were also \ncirculated by email, which shows a certain amount of coordination. (See Doc. 292-15.)  Again, the \ninference can be made from this fact that the response was coordinated and orchestrated. \nFinally, Defendantsโ agreement is perhaps shown best by the events leading up to the \narrests.   Plaintiffs submit evidence that, after an hour at East and France, BRPD declared, โWhere \nyou are standing is not good enough.โ (Myron Daniels Dep. 120:8โ10, Doc. 292-22; see also John \nClary Dep. 91:7โ12, Doc. 292-19 (โQ. So you heard the leave now, leave now. Where you are \nstanding is not good enough? A. Yes, sir. Q. So is that the dispersal order that you described? A. \n94 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 95 of 110\nYes, sir. . . . โ).)  Lieutenant Christopher Taylor also stated in response to an audio clip of David \nWallace (one of the shift leads):  \n \nQ. Just to repeat what is sounded to me like [Wallace] said, it was, \nYou've got one of the leaders requesting to walk on the sidewalk \npast France. Someone else responds, It's too late. Then 10-9. Then \nresponds, Too late. Everyone has violated.   Everyone is under \narrest.  Those  who  can  safely  apprehend  violators  must  do  so. \nPrimary targets are the white male, red hair, tie-dyed shirt, and \neveryone else who is violating, which is everybody out there. Does \nthat sound about right? \n \nA. Yes, sir. \n \n(Christopher Taylor Dep. 144:4โ22, Doc. 292-21; see also id. at 61:19โ62:3 (on Wallaceโs role).)   \nNone of the above evidence constitutes direct proof of a conspiracy.  But, again, โa \nconspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence.โ Mack, 737 F.2d at 1350 (cleaned up).  \nโSince conspiracies . . . are rarely evidenced by explicit agreements, the determination of whether \na conspiracy existed almost inevitably rests on the inferences that may fairly be drawn from the \nbehavior of the alleged conspirators.โ Id. (cleaned up).  Here, Plaintiffsโ submissions, detailed \nabove, reflect a โcommitment to a common end,โ a โunity of purpose,โ and a โmeeting of minds \nin an unlawful arrangement.โ Id. (cleaned up).  \nIn sum, construing all of this evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing \nreasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable juror could find an agreement on the part of the \nCity  and  BRPD  officers  to  deprive  Plaintiffs  of  their  constitutional  rights,  including  equal \nprotection, by making mass arrests and suppressing speech without justification.  Accordingly, \nDefendantsโ motion will be denied.  \n \n \n95 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 96 of 110\nV.  Discussion of State Law Claims \nA.  Louisiana Constitution \n   Defendants move to dismiss the Louisiana constitution claims to the same extent as the \nfederal claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 20.)  Plaintiffs argue they should be denied for the same reasons \nthey previously argued. (Doc. 309 at 20.)   \n  In short, the Court agrees with the parties.  Under the Louisiana Constitution, โ[n]o law \nshall curtail or restrain the freedom of speech or of the press. Every person may speak, write, and \npublish his sentiments on any subject, but is responsible for abuse of that freedom.โ La. Const. art. \nI, ยง 7.  The Fifth Circuit has recognized that โLouisiana's constitutional protection of free speech \nmirrors that of the First Amendment, so separate determinations of the state and federal claims are \nunnecessary.โ Heaney v. Roberts, 846 F.3d 795, 802 n.2 (5th Cir. 2017). \nLikewise, โ[i]n Louisiana, the right to privacy ensures that โ[e]very person shall be secure \nin  his  person,  property,  communications,  houses,  papers,  and  effects  against  unreasonable \nsearches, seizures, or invasions of privacy.โ โ Bagley v. Kolb, No. 19-10, 2021 WL 3376830, at \n*16 (W.D. La. Aug. 3, 2021) (quoting La. Const. art. I, ยง 5). โAlthough the Louisiana Supreme \nCourt has not articulated a clear standard for state constitutional claims alleging excessive force, \nโLouisiana federal district courts have noted that principles embodied in the Fourth Amendment \nhave been incorporated into Article I, Section 5 of the Louisiana Constitution.โ โ Id. (quoting \nShepherd v. City of Shreveport, No. 14-2623, 2018 WL 1513679, at *10 (W.D. La. Mar. 27, 2018) \n(citing Todd v. City of Natchitoches, 238 F. Supp. 2d 793, 798โ99 (W.D. La. 2002))). Further the \nWestern District has also โheld that absent more precise guidance from the Louisiana Supreme \nCourt, the โFourth Amendment standards control the analysis of alleged infringements on the \nconstitutional right to privacy.โ โ Id. (quoting Tucker v. City of Shreveport, No. 17-1485, 2019 WL \n96 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 97 of 110\n961993, at *11 (W.D. La. Feb. 27, 2019), rev'd on other grounds, 998 F.3d 165 (5th Cir. 2021)).  \nThus, in Bagley, the Western District granted and denied summary judgment on plaintiffโs state \nlaw constitutional claims to the same extent as it did the federal claims. See id.  \n  Accordingly, because the Court has denied summary judgment as to Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 \nclaims, the Court will likewise deny summary judgment as to the corresponding claims under the \nLouisiana Constitution. \nB.  IIED and NIED \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nDefendants then turn to Plaintiffsโ intentional infliction of emotional distress (โIIEDโ) and \nnegligent infliction of emotional distress (โNIEDโ) claims. (Doc. 307-1 at 20โ21.)  Defendants say \nthat โthe officers preparing the affidavits of probable cause believed at the time that they were \nconducting themselves within the boundaries of the law, and at least some of the affidavits of \nprobable  cause were prepared by officers with knowledge of the violations[.]โ  (Id.  at 21.)  \nDefendants further contend, โSeveral plaintiffs have alleged brief counseling, and a few have \nclaimed longer periods of counseling for emotional trauma, anxiety, and so forth, but few if any \nhave tried to show any causation linking the supposed trauma and distress to the conduct of the \ndefendants.โ (Id.)  Defendants maintain that they lack the intent to inflict emotional distress and \nrather sought to clear the roadways. (Id.)  According to Defendants, their actions do not rise to the \nlevel of โextreme and outrageous,โ and it is not โatrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized \ncommunity.โ (Id. at 22.) \nPlaintiffs respond that โDefendants do not know much about Plaintiffsโ emotional injuries. \nThat is because they declined to notice any Plaintiff for deposition.โ (Doc. 309 at 20.)  Only Raae \nPollard was deposed, and BRPD asked her no questions. (Id.)  While Defendants concede that \n97 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 98 of 110\nseveral Plaintiffs received therapy, โmost Plaintiffs have not yet testified or been deposed โ and so \nthey have not had any opportunity to โshowโ causation.โ (Id. at 21.)  In any event, there is evidence \nin the record reflecting Raee Pollardโs emotional distress. (Id.)  Plaintiffs conclude, โDefendants \nconducted no deposition questioning of Plaintiffs whatsoever about their emotional distress. They \nnow try to point to the absence of evidence as evidence of absence. Defendantsโ motion should be \ndenied.โ (Id.)   \n2. Applicable Law \nUnder Louisiana law, Plaintiff must establish the following to recover for IIED: โ(1) that \nthe conduct of the defendant was extreme and outrageous; (2) that the emotional distress suffered \nby the plaintiff was severe; and (3) that the defendant desired to inflict severe emotional distress \nor knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or substantially certain to result from his \nconduct.โ  White v. Monsanto Co., 585 So. 2d 1205, 1209 (La. 1991). \nAs to the first  requirement, โ[t]he conduct must be so outrageous in character, and so \nextreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious \nand utterly intolerable in a civilized community.โ Id. โLiability does not extend to mere insults, \nindignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. Persons must necessarily \nbe expected to be hardened to a certain amount of rough language, and to occasional acts that are \ndefinitely inconsiderate and unkind.โ Id.  \nAs to the second element, โ[t]he distress suffered must be such that no reasonable person \ncould be expected to endure it. Liability arises only where the mental suffering or anguish is \nextreme.โ Id. at 1210 (citations omitted). \nAs to the final prong, โ[l]iability can arise only where the actor desires to inflict severe \nemotional distress or where he knows that such distress is certain or substantially certain to result \n98 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 99 of 110\nfrom his conduct.โ Id. (citation omitted).  โThe conduct must be intended or calculated to cause \nsevere emotional distress and not just some lesser degree of fright, humiliation, embarrassment, \nworry, or the like.โ Id. \nAs to the NIED claims, โ[g]enerally, a defendant will not be held liable under Louisiana \nlaw where its conduct is merely negligent and causes only emotional injury unaccompanied by \nphysical injury.โ Molden v. Georgia Gulf Corp., 465 F. Supp. 2d 606, 614 (M.D. La. 2006) \n(citing Moresi v. State, Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries, 567 So. 2d 1081, 1096 (La. 1990)). \nโIn Moresi, the Louisiana Supreme Court considered whether a plaintiff could recover for mental \ndisturbances caused by a defendant's ordinary negligence when the mental disturbance was \nunaccompanied by physical injury, illness, or other physical consequences.โ Id. (citing Moresi, \n567 So. 2d at 1095). The Moresi โcourt refused to allow recovery for mental anguish absent a \nphysical injury except in โspecial circumstances.โ โ Id. (quoting Moresi, 567 So. 2d at 1096). \nโTo date, the Louisiana courts have identified only four instances in which recovery is \nallowed for mental anguish without physical injury.โ Id. โThese instances all involve โthe especial \nlikelihood of genuine and serious mental distress, arising from the special circumstances, which \nserve as a guarantee that the claim is not spurious.โ โ Id. (quoting Moresi, 567 So. 2d at 1096). \nWhile four categories are provided, the one relevant here is: \nA plaintiff may recover damages for a defendant's infliction of \nemotional  distress  based  on  a  separate  tort  involving  physical \nconsequences to the person or property of the plaintiff, such as an \nassault or a battery, false imprisonment, trespass to land, nuisance \nor the invasion of the person's right to privacy. [Moresi, 567 So. 2d \nat 1095.] \n \nId. at 614.10 \n \n10 The other three categories are: \n \n99 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 100 of 110\nโWhen a plaintiff does not fall into one of [these] four categories, the plaintiff must prove \nthe โclaim is not spurious by showing a particular likelihood of genuine and serious mental distress \narising from special circumstances.โ โ Id. (quoting Bonnette v. Conoco, Inc., 837 So. 2d 1219, \n1235 (2003)). โIf the plaintiff is unable to meet this standard, recovery for mental distress is not \nallowed absent physical injury.โ Id. \n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it \nin part. Specifically, the Court will dismiss the IIED claims but finds that the NIED claims survive. \nAs to the IIED claims, Plaintiffs complain that Defendants have not engaged in sufficient \ndiscovery to determine what injuries Plaintiffs suffered, but that is not their burden.  Again, โ[a] \nmovant for summary judgment need not set forth evidence when the nonmovant bears the burden \nof persuasion at trial.โ Wease, 915 F.3d at 997 (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323).  โThe moving \nparty may meet its burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact by \npointing out that the record contains no support for the non-moving party's claim.โ Id. (citation \nomitted).  Thus, Defendants did not need to engage in discovery concerning Plaintiffsโ injuries; \n \nA defendant's intentional infliction of emotional distress will also support an \naward for mental anguish damages. [White, 585 So. 2d 1205.] \n \nFurthermore, when the plaintiff is a direct participant in the accident causing the \nemotional injury, and the defendant owes a direct, specific statutory duty to the \nplaintiff to refrain from the specific conduct that causes the accident, damages for \nthe infliction of emotional distress may be awarded, even absent physical injury. \n[Clomon v. Monroe City School Board, 572 So. 2d 571, 586 (La. 1990); Guillory \nv. Arceneaux, 580 So. 2d 990 (La. App. 3 Cir. 1991).] \n \nFinally, a bystander may recover an award for infliction of emotional distress \nwhere the bystander either views the accident or injury causing event or comes \nupon the accident before a substantial change. [Lejeune v. Rayne Branch Hospital, \n556 So. 2d 559, 570 (La. 1990). See also La. Civ. Code art. 2315.6 (codifying \nLejeune). \n \nMolden, 465 F. Supp. 2d at 614โ15. \n100 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 101 of 110\nrather, it was incumbent on Plaintiffs to bring forward summary judgment evidence showing there \nis a genuine issue for trial. See Matsushita Elec. Indus., 475 U.S. at 586โ87.  \nPlaintiffs have largely failed to do so.  Elsewhere in their brief, Plaintiffs rely on the \noperative complaint to describe Plaintiffsโ injuries, but that cannot defeat summary judgment.  See \n10A Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) ยง 2722 (4th ed. 2022) \n(โBecause the summary-judgment motion is designed to pierce the formal allegations of the \npleadings, it normally is not made or opposed on the basis of the pleadings alone.โ); see also 10A \nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) ยง 2739 (4th ed. 2022) (โRule \n56 was amended in 1963 to add language in what then was subdivision (e) that explicitly stated \nthat an opposing party could not rest upon mere allegations or denials in its pleading. . . . Thus, the \npractice prescribed by the amendment now is applied throughout the federal courts[.]โ); 1963 \nAdvisory Committee Note to Rule 56(e) (โThe very mission of the summary judgment procedure \nis to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for \ntrial. The Third Circuit doctrine, which permit[ed] the pleadings themselves to stand in the way of \ngranting an otherwise justified summary judgment, [wa]s incompatible with the basic purpose of \nthe rule.โ (quoted with approval by Kane, supra, at ยง 2739)).  Further, Defendants have provided \na description of interrogatory responses seeking information about medical treatment. (Doc. 307-\n1 at 5โ9.)  But the Court has reviewed this material and finds that none of it reflects the kind of \nsevere and extreme emotional damages required for an IIED claim. \nWhile Plaintiffs do submit evidence as to Raae Pollard, that testimony does not meet her \nburden.  Pollard stated that her emotional distress damages included โdepression, loss of appetite, \nweight loss, and social isolationโ as well as an effect on her willingness to participate in future \nprotests or demonstrations. (Raae Pollard Dep. 38:19โ39:10, Doc. 298-18.)   But Pollard could not \n101 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 102 of 110\nsay whether these problems still affect her today. (Id.)   Even considering the evidence in a light \nmost favorable to Plaintiff, the Court cannot say that  โ[t]he distress suffered [is] such that no \nreasonable person could be expected to endure itโ or that โthe mental suffering or anguish is \nextreme.โ See White, 585 So. 2d at 1210 (citations omitted). \nFor all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a genuine issue \nof material fact on their IIED claims.  Consequently, they will be dismissed. \nHowever, the Court will deny the motion with respect to the NIED claims.  As stated above,  \n \nA plaintiff may recover damages for a defendant's infliction of \nemotional  distress  based  on  a  separate  tort  involving  physical \nconsequences to the person or property of the plaintiff, such as an \nassault or a battery, false imprisonment, trespass to land, nuisance \nor the invasion of the person's right to privacy.  \n \nMolden, 465 F. Supp. 2d at 614 (citing Moresi, 567 So. 2d at 1095).  As established elsewhere in \nthis ruling, Plaintiffs have viable claims for assault, battery, and false imprisonment. Therefore, \nDefendantsโ motion on this issue will be denied.  \nC.  Assault and Battery \n1. Partiesโ Arguments \nAs to the assault and battery claims, Defendants assert:  \nUnder the circumstances presented, where the officers have been \npelted with bottles and stones, the large numbers of protesters whose \nstatus as armed or unarmed is unknown, the possibility of being \nseparated and outnumbered in a physical conflict, and the officers \nnot  using  weapons,  whether  lethal  or  non-lethal,  all  indicate  a \nreasonable use of force. \n \n(Doc. 307-1 at 23.)   \n  Plaintiffs respond that there is only evidence of two bottles thrown and that nothing was \nthrown by Plaintiffs. (Doc. 309 at 21.)  Further, there is no evidence to suggest that the protesters \nwere armed or that any officer believed them to be so. (Id.)  To the contrary, the pictures of \n102 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 103 of 110\nPlaintiffs being arrested show them surrounded by law enforcement officers. (Id. at 21โ22.)  \nAdditionally, the โnature of the offenseโ was a non-violent misdemeanor, and Defendants did not \nknow the โcharacter of the arresteeโ other than that they were protesters. (Id. at 22.)  The โexigency \nof the momentโ is โhighly disputed.โ (Id.)  In sum, โ[w]hether the amount of force used in these \narrests was reasonable is better left up to the finder of fact. Defendantsโ motion should be denied.โ \n(Id.) \n2. Applicable Law  \nLouisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 220 provides, โA person shall submit \npeaceably to a lawful arrest. The person making a lawful arrest may use reasonable force to effect \nthe arrest and detention, and also to overcome any resistance or threatened resistance of the person \nbeing arrested or detained.โ La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 220. โThe use of force by law enforcement \nofficers must be tested by the โreasonable forceโ standard established by this article. The test \nprecludes โclearly inappropriate force.โ โ Kyle v. City of New Orleans, 353 So. 2d 969, 972 (La. \n1977) (quoting La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 220, Official Revision Comment (b)).   \nโThe use of force when necessary to make an arrest is a legitimate police function.โ \nId.   โBut if the officers use unreasonable or excessive force, they and their employer are liable for \nany injuries which result.โ Id. (citations omitted); see also Penn v. St. Tammany Par. Sheriff's Off., \n2002-0893 (La. App. 1 Cir. 4/2/03), 843 So. 2d 1157, 1161 (stating that excessive force transforms \nauthorized use of force into a battery).  โWhether the force used is reasonable depends upon the \ntotality of the facts and circumstances in each case.โ Kyle, 353 So. 2d at 973.  โA court must \nevaluate the officersโ actions against those of ordinary, prudent, and reasonable men placed in the \nsame position as the officers and with the same knowledge as the officers.โ Id. โThe degree of \nforce employed is a factual issue.โ Id. (citations omitted). \n103 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 104 of 110\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court has explained further: \n \nSeveral factors to be considered in making this determination are the \nknown character of the arrestee, the risks and dangers faced by the \nofficers,  the  nature  of  the  offense  involved,  the  chance  of  the \narrestee's escape  if the  particular means  are not employed, the \nexistence of alternative methods of arrest, the physical size, strength, \nand weaponry of the officers as compared to the arrestee, and the \nexigencies of the moment. \n \nKyle, 353 So. 2d at 973 (citations omitted). \n  Ultimately, โexcessive force claims under both federal and Louisiana law turn on whether \nthe use of force was objectively reasonable given the totality of the circumstances. This has been \nwidely recognized by [the Fifth Circuit], Louisiana federal district courts, and the Louisiana \nSupreme Court.โ Shepherd on behalf of Est. of Shepherd v. City of Shreveport, 920 F.3d 278, 286 \n(5th Cir. 2019) (collecting cases).  \n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny Defendantsโ motion, largely \nfor the same reasons the federal excessive force claims survive. In short, questions of fact preclude \nsummary judgment. \nConstruing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing reasonable \ninferences in their favor, a reasonable jury could easily conclude that the force used in this case \nwas excessive.  Again, the officerโs vulnerability to the protesters is in question, given Defendantsโ \nbody armor, armored vehicle, LRAD, pistols, patrol rifles, and the ability to deploy tear gas, (see \nRule 30(b)(6) Dep. 120:1โ5, 126:11โ127:2,  128:10โ17, 214:8โ10, Doc. 292-25), in addition to \ntheir undercover operative, helicopter, and โfixed wing airplaneโ for overhead footage, (id. at \n215:20โ21, 222:6โ8).  All of this contrasts strongly to the extensive evidence, discussed above, \nthat these protests were peaceful. (See, e.g., Kraska Report, Doc. 309-3 at 6; Pusins Report, Doc. \n104 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 105 of 110\n309-2 at 47.)  Further, each of the offenses at issue were minor misdemeanors, thereby decreasing \nthe need for force.  The officers cannot complain of the arrestees escaping, as the officers (at least \nostensibly) wanted the crowd to disperse.   \nIn sum, looking at the totality of the circumstances from the facts presented by Plaintiffs, \na jury could find that the arresting officers employed โclearly inappropriate forceโ to the protesters.  \nConsequently, Defendantsโ motion will be denied.   \nD.  False Imprisonment \nDefendants incorporate their previous arguments about false imprisonment. (Doc. 307-1 at \n23.)  Plaintiffs do the same. (Doc. 309 at 22.)  \nโUnder Louisiana law, โ[f]alse arrest and imprisonment occur when one arrests and \nrestrains another against his will without a warrant or other statutory authority. Simply stated, it is \nrestraint without color of legal authority.โ โ Elphage v. Gautreaux, 969 F. Supp. 2d 493, 514 (M.D. \nLa. 2013) (quoting Kyle v. City of New Orleans, 353 So. 2d 969, 971 (La. 1977)). โ[I]f police \nofficers act pursuant to statutory authority in arresting and incarcerating a citizen, they are not \nliable for damages for false arrest and imprisonment.โ Id. (quoting Kyle, 353 So. 2d at 971). See \nalso La. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 213 (describing circumstances of warrantless arrest), 215.1 \n(describing circumstances of Terry stop). \n  This Courtโs analysis to Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 false imprisonment and false arrest claims \napplies with equal force to the state law claims.  See Elphage, 969 F. Supp. 2d at 515 (citing \nHarrison v. State Through Dept. of Pub. Safety and Corr., 97-1086 (La. 12/1/98); 721 So. 2d 458, \n462โ63); O'Dwyer v. Nelson, 310 F. App'x 741, 745 n.4 (5th Cir. 2009) (finding that, because \nFourth  Amendment  principles  underpin  Louisiana  law  relating  to  false  arrests,  the  Fourth \nAmendment inquiry  was applicable to both O'Dwyer's  federal  and state law  claims (citing \n105 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 106 of 110\nHarrison, 721 So. 2d at 462โ63)). See also Curran v. Aleshire, 67 F. Supp. 3d 741, 754 (E.D. La. \n2014) (dismissing federal and state false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution \nclaims as Heck-barred).  Accordingly, for the same reasons highlighted above, the Court will deny \nDefendantsโ motion on the state law false imprisonment claims. \nE.  Malicious Prosecution \nDefendants urge that Plaintiffsโ malicious prosecution claim should be dismissed because \nthere was probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs. (Doc. 307-1 at 23.)  Plaintiffs respond that, for the \nsame reasons given earlier, there was no probable cause for the arrests, so Defendantsโ motion \nshould be denied. (Doc. 309 at 23.) \nThe elements of a Louisiana state law malicious prosecution claim are:  \n(1) the commencement or continuance of an original criminal or \ncivil  judicial  proceeding;  (2)  its  legal  causation  by  the  present \ndefendant in the original proceeding; (3) its bona fide termination in \nfavor of the present plaintiff; (4) the absence of probable cause for \nsuch proceeding; (5) the presence of malice therein; and (6) damage \nconforming to legal standards resulting to plaintiff. \n \nLemoine v. Wolfe, 2014โ1546 (La. 3/17/15), 168 So. 3d 362, 367 (citation omitted).  Here, \nDefendants attack only the fourth requirement. \nBecause this Court has already determined that a reasonable juror could find the absence \nof probable cause, Plaintiffs have created questions of fact on their malicious prosecution claims.  \nConsequently, Defendantsโ motion will be denied. \nF.  Negligence \n1. Partiesโ Arguments  \nDefendants next assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on the negligence claim. \n(Doc. 307-1 at 23โ24.) Defendants contend: \n106 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 107 of 110\nThe officers were faced with an unprecedented event, had reliable \ninformation, known to all, of an impending attempt to take over the \ninterstate. With hundreds of protesters lining the streets, over an \nhour of trying to convince them to depart, and the generally nominal \ninjuries claimed by plaintiffs, the defendants herein cannot be seen \nas negligent. \n \n(Id.) \n  Plaintiffs respond first by noting inconsistencies in Defendantsโ position, such as their \nsaying the situation was unexpected while at the same time maintaining that the protestersโ general \ntactic of overrunning the interstate was well-known. (Doc. 309 at 23.)  In any event, Defendants \nfail to argue the specific elements of a negligence claim, but the facts as pled do establish same. \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs assert: \nAlthough there is a dispute regarding the extent of harm suffered by \nPlaintiffs, parties seem to agree that there was some injury. Parties \nalso agree that Defendants owed a duty of care to Plaintiffs. And \nclearly, injuries caused by use of force, arrest, and other violations \nwould fall within the scope of risk of violating that duty. The \nquestion of whether the duty was breached relies on several disputed \nfacts, including the amount of injuries suffered, whether Defendants \nhad probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs, and other issues at the core \nof this case. Many of those questions are better decided by the finder \nof fact and, therefore, the motion should be denied.  \n \n(Id.) \n2. Applicable Law \nโThe duty-risk analysis  is  the  standard  negligence  analysis  employed  in  determining \nwhether to impose liability underโ Article 2315. Lemann v. Essen Lane Daiquiris, Inc., 2005-1095 \n(La. 3/10/06); 923 So.2d 627, 632โ33 (citing Mathieu v. Imperial Toy Corp., 94-0952 (La. \n11/30/94); 646 So. 2d. 318, 321). Under this analysis, a plaintiff must prove five separate elements: \n(1) the defendant had a duty to conform his conduct to a specific \nstandard (the duty element); (2) the defendant's conduct failed to \nconform to the appropriate standard (the breach element); (3) the \ndefendant's substandard conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's \n107 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 108 of 110\ninjuries (the cause-in-fact element); (4) the defendant's substandard \nconduct was a legal cause of the plaintiff's injuries (the scope of \nliability or scope of protection element); and (5) the actual damages \n(the damages element). \n \nId. at 633 (citing Fowler v. Roberts, 556 So. 2d 1, 4 (La. 1989), reh'g granted on other grounds \nand original opinion reinstated as supplemented, 556 So. 2d at 13 (La. 1990)). โA negative answer \nto  any  of  the  inquiries  of  the duty-risk analysis  results  in  a  determination  of  no \nliability.โ Id. (citing Mathieu, 646 So. 2d at 326). \n3. Analysis \nHaving carefully considered the matter, the Court will deny the motion, for the reasons \ngiven by Plaintiffs.  Defendants seem to argue that they breached no duty and that, if they did, \nPlaintiffs suffered only nominal injuries.  As to the latter, the Court already determined in the \nexcessive force section that Plaintiffs suffered some injury, even if they were minor.   \nAs to the breach element, there are simply too many questions of fact, detailed throughout \nthis ruling, to find in favor of Defendants.  A reasonable jury could easily find that these \nDefendants failed to act as reasonably prudent officers under the circumstances.  Consequently, \nDefendantsโ motion will be denied.  \nG. Vicarious Liability and Indemnity \nDefendants lastly seek dismissal of the vicarious liability and indemnity claims. (Doc. 307-\n1 at 24โ25.)  Defendants argue that, because Plaintiffs cannot establish an underlying tort, there \ncan be no respondent superior liability. (Id. at 25.)  As to indemnity, Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffsโ position echoes its vicarious liability claim. (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs respond that the sole basis for Defendantsโ argument on vicarious liability is the \nabsence of an underlying tort. (Doc. 309 at 24.)  Since Plaintiffs have met their burden on the other \nclaims, Defendantsโ motion should be denied here. (Id.)  Further, โDefendants do not offer any \n108 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 109 of 110\nargument to find summary judgment on indemnity beyond claiming that it is a restatement of \nvicarious liability.โ (Id.)  \nTurning to the law, โ[a]t common law, the Latin phrase respondeat superior (โlet the \nmaster answerโ) denotes the employerโs liability for the employeeโs tort committed in the course \nand scope of employment.โ 1 Frank L. Maraist, et al., Louisiana Tort Law ยง 13.02 (2021).  โThe \nfoundation of respondeat superior is the employeeโs tort. Thus, where the employee was not guilty \nof a tort, the employer cannot be vicariously liable.โ Id.  โLouisiana Civil Code Article 2320 \ncodifies the concept, providing, in part:    [โ]Masters and employers are answerable for the damage \noccasioned by then-servants and overseers, in the exercise of the functions in which they are \nemployed [.][โ] โ Id. \nAs to the indemnity claim, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs; Defendantsโ position rests \nentirely on the lack of an underlying tort.  \nFor all of the above reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated questions of \nfact on nearly all of their claims.  Consequently, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss the vicarious \nliability and indemnity claims will be denied. \nVI.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 297) filed by all \nPlaintiffs is DENIED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 307) filed \nby Defendants is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The motion is GRANTED in \nthat the following claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE: (1) Plaintiffsโ claims against \n109 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00439-JWD-EWD     Document 347    07/14/22   Page 110 of 110\ninterim BRPD Chief of Police Jonny Dunnam in his official capacity, and (2) Plaintiffsโ claims for \nintentional infliction of emotional distress.
