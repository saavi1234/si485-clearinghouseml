    "summary": "<p>Disability Rights Florida (\"DRF\"), brought this suit against the Florida Department of Corrections (\"FDOC\") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida on January 26, 2016. The plaintiff, a federally designated protection and advocacy agency for the State of Florida, alleged that the defendant failed to provide inmates with disabilities access to its programs and services in violation of federal law. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendant failed to provide interpreters, hearing aids, telecommunications access, and effective emergency alerts to inmates who were deaf or hard of hearing; failed to maintain wheelchair-accessible facilities or provide and maintain wheelchairs and prosthetic devices for inmates with mobility impairments; excluded inmates with disabilities from education, employment, and recreational programs; charged inmates for accommodations relating to their disabilities; retaliated against those who asserted their rights as persons with disabilities; and failed to train staff on issues related to disability rights and federal disability law. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Eighth Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On April 25, 2016, the state filed a motion for partial dismissal. Florida argued that several of the inmates named in the Complaint were no longer in FDOC custody or had already settled their claims. The defendant also argued that several of the allegations were barred by a four-year statute of limitations.</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in conferences over the next several months.</p>\r\n<p>On January 9, 2017, the United States moved to intervene in the case, claiming a substantial interest because of the ADA and Section 504 issues at stake. On January 30, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On February 6, 2017, the parties jointly moved for a stay of proceedings so that they could actively pursue settlement. On July 7, 2017, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement. The settlement required the FDOC to implement changes that would make Florida prison services, programming, and other aspects of daily activities, including emergency notifications, accessible to inmates with physical disabilities. The settlement also required FDOC to provide appropriate training for staff members on disability laws as well as establish internal policies regarding inmates with disabilities. The settlement required that DRF be able to conduct visits and speak confidentially with inmates to ensure compliance with the agreement. The settlement also required the FDOC to pay $2,000,000 in attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On July 11, Judge Robert L. Hinkle issued an order requiring the parties to comply with the Settlement Agreement, dismissing the claims, and retaining jurisdiction solely for the purpose of enforcing the Agreement. On July 13, the parties filed a motion asking the court to alter the July 11 order to reflect their wish that the Agreement be enforceable only through a breach of contract action in state court, not through an order of the U.S. District Court. Accordingly, on August 7, Judge Hinkle issued a new order recognizing as effective the parties' joint stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice and end the court's jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>However, in the fall of 2017, a number of inmates of FDOC, acting pro se, submitted filings to the court stating that they had been denied access to the settlement agreement or had been retaliated against for submitting grievances to the prison administration for issues relating to their disabilities. One inmate filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On December 6, 2017, Judge Hinkle denied the motion, reasserting that the case was closed and suggesting that the individual file a separate lawsuit if he intended to pursue legal action. The same individual, again acting pro se, filed an appeal on December 4, 2017, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, challenging the court's order closing the case. On December 18, he also appealed the order denying his motion for a preliminary injunction. On February 5, 2018, the court of appeals dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution.</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2019, a prisoner who was not a party to the law suit and had not been included in the class submitted a letter requesting relief based on inadequate medical care. The court entered this letter in the record as a motion for injunctive relief, and issued an order denying this motion on August 6, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement is set to expire on July 6, 2021 so long as the defendants remain in compliance with the agreement. As of the latest update in March 2020, the case remains ongoing.</p>",

Procedures for the Compliance Visits \nlV \n\nUNITED ST ATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nTallahassee Division \nDISABILITY RIGHTS FLORIDA, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nvs.  Case No. 4:16-cv-47-RH-CAS \nJULIE JONES, in her official capacity as \nSecretary of the Florida Department of \nCorrections, \nDefendant. \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThe Plaintiff, DISABILITY RIGHTS FLORIDA, INC., (\"DRF\") and the Defendant, \nJULIE JONES, sued in her official capacity as Secretary of the Florida Department of \nCorrections (\"FDC\") (collectively the \"Parties\"), have entered into this Settlement Agreement \n(\"Agreement\") as a plan for settling this litigation.  Both Parties agree to comply with the \nfollowing terms. The Parties do not intend that this Agreement will be enforceable by an order \nof this Court.  As set forth below, this Agreement is a contract enforceable in state court should \nthe FDC significantly breach this Agreement.  That this Agreement is not a Consent Decree is a \nkey factor in FDC' s willingness to enter into this Agreement. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nDRF initiated this action by filing a Complaint on January 6, 2016.  In the Complaint, \nDRF alleges that FDC has violated and continues to violate, in a systemic fashion, Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Eighth \nPage 1  \n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, and the Due Process Clause of the United States \nConstitution, in its treatment of inmates who have hearing, vision, and mobility disabilities.  FDC \nresponded to DRF's allegations by denying all liability. \nDRF did not, and does not, assert any claims based on the treatment of, or on behalf of, \nFDC inmates with mental, emotional, cognitive, or developmental disabilities, unless those \ninmates also have a physical disability involving their hearing, vision or mobility.  To the extent \nthat inmates with mental, emotional, cognitive, or developmental disabilities also have hearing, \nvision, or mobility disabilities, this Agreement provides for compliance activities only for their \nhearing, vision, and mobility disabilities. \nThis Agreement is the product of multiple mediation meetings, and the Parties believe that \nthis Agreement represents a fair settlement of DRF's claims. \nII. DEFINITIONS \n1.  Days.  Unless otherwise specified, references to \"days\" shall be to calendar days. \nIf the last day of the specified period falls on a weekend or holiday, the due date shall be the next \nbusiness day. \n2.  Deaf/Hard of Hearing Inmates.  Abbreviated herein as \"D/HOH inmate\".  This \nmeans an FDC inmate with a physical impairment that substantially limits the inmate's hearing, \nas defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12102. \n3.  Inmates with Vision Disabilities.  Abbreviated herein as \"IVD.\" This means an \nFDC inmate with a physical impairment that substantially limits the inmate's seeing, as defined \nin the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12102. \n4.  Inmates with Mobility Disabilities.  Abbreviated herein as \"IMD,\" or \"IMDs.\" \nThis means an FDC inmate with a physical impairment that affects the inmate's ability to move, \nPage 2   \n\nwhich substantially limits the inmate's major life activities of walking, standing, bending, \nperforming manual tasks, lifting, reaching, or sitting, as defined in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 42 C.F.R. § 35.108. \n5.  Covered Inmates.  For purposes of this Agreement, Covered Inmates means any \nDeaf/Hard of Hearing Inmate, BlindNisually Impaired Inmate, or Inmate with a Mobility \nDisability. \n6.  Compelling Security Concern.  For purposes of this Agreement, a \"compelling \nsecurity concern,\" as it relates to a reasonable accommodation, aid, or device, that has been \nprovided or may be provided to a Covered Inmate, exists if the accommodation, auxiliary aid, or \ndevice cannot be adequately searched by FDC for contraband, is contraband, has been used as a \nweapon, can be weaponized to harm the Covered Inmate or others, or can be used to facilitate an \nescape.  Documentation of the compelling security concern shall be maintained. \nIII. GENERAL PLAN OF COMPLIANCE \nThe Parties agree to the following Plan of Compliance: \n7.  Location of Covered Inmates.  Effective July 1, 2017, FDC will begin to locate \nCovered Inmates in the facilities listed in the attached Exhibit A  This will be accomplished by \nJune 30, 2018, except for inmates in restrictive housing.  Covered Inmates in restrictive housing \ncells will be moved as the architectural modifications to the restrictive housing cells are \ncompleted. All restrictive housing cells will be completed no later than December 31, 2019. \nThe services contemplated for the Covered Inmates will be provided at the facilities listed, in \naccordance with the implementation schedules referred to herein. \n8.  General Time Frames for Implementation of Requirements of General Plan \nof Compliance. Attached as Exhibit B is an Implementation Schedule which describes the time \nPage 3   \n\nframes for implementation of the requirements of the General Plan of Compliance, except for \narchitectural modifications which are described in paragraph 57 below.  The Parties agree that \nthe timing of compliance as set forth in this document is an essential term of the Agreement. \n9.  Recreational Tracks.  Existing recreational tracks at the facilities listed on \nExhibit A, that are used for activities such as running and walking by inmates, shall be paved so \nthat they can be safely traversed by IVDs and IMDs. \n10.  Health, Safety, &  Welfare.  FDC reserves the right to  temporarily suspend a \nCovered Inmate's access to any accommodation, aid, or device, to protect the health, safety, and \nwelfare of inmates or staff. \n11.  Changes to Physical Disability Policies.  FDC shall complete a review of its \npolicies, rules, procedures, Health Service Bulletins, manuals, the Inmate Handbook, and post \norders, and any associated forms that reference the treatment of Covered Inmates (hereinafter \ncollectively referred to as \"policies\") to determine which of them must be modified to comply \nwith the provisions of this Agreement.  Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the Effective \nDate, FDC shall provide to DRF, in draft, the revisions to the policies.  However, FDC will also \nprovide revised drafts of the policies as they become available.  DRF shall have sixty ( 60) days \nto provide feedback to FDC on the proposed revised changes.  While FDC will consider DRF's \nfeedback, FDC reserves the right to make the final decision as to policy content.  Within thirty \n(30) days after receiving DRF's feedback, FDC will initiate rulemaking for those policies \nrequiring Chapter 120 rulemaking, will adopt any finalized policies not requiring rulemaking, \nand will provide final copies to DRF.  The FDC shall comply with these new policies to the \nextent that they relate to this Agreement. \nPage 4   \n\n12.  Initial Identification of Disabilities and Accommodations at Reception.  At \nReception, FDC will attempt to identify whether an inmate has a hearing, vision, or mobility \ndisability.  If it is determined that the inmate is a Covered Inmate, FDC will determine the extent \nof the disability, and whether he or she needs any accommodations, aids, or services. For \nD/HOH Inmates and IVD Inmates, FDC will evaluate the verbal and written communication \nskills, reading level, and where appropriate, the inmate's proficiency in sign language (including \nAmerican Sign Language) by an appropriate professional.  The sign language evaluation must be \ncompleted by a Qualified Interpreter.  The assessment must also include documentation of any \nneeds and accommodations desired by the inmate, and FDC will consider the Covered Inmate's \nstated preferences.  FDC shall conduct an individualized assessment of the need for \naccommodations, aids, or services required by the Covered Inmate.  Results of this assessment \nwill be documented and placed in the Covered Inmate's record, documented in FDC's electronic \nsystem (currently called \"Offender Based Information System\" or OBIS), and will be made \navailable as needed, to FDC staff responsible for the inmate's medical care, programs, or custody \nand supervision at both Reception and the permanent prison.  The FDC will use this information \nso that needed accommodations, aids, or services are provided. \n13.  Periodic Re-assessments of Covered Inmates.  At least once per year, FDC \nwill conduct periodic re-assessments of Covered Inmates to determine whether any changes in \naccommodations are necessary.  These re-assessments shall include but not be limited to \ndetermining whether the Covered Inmate is receiving effective accommodations for his or her \ndisability, whether the Covered Inmate desires any other accommodations, and a medical \nexamination, if appropriate.  Results of any changes in the Covered Inmate's status, or his or her \nPage 5   \n\npermitted accommodations, will be provided, or made available, to FDC staff responsible for the \nCovered Inmate's medical care, programs, or custody and supervision. \n14.  Repair or Replacement of Preexisting Accommodations; Sending to Designee. \nIf a Covered Inmate comes into custody with an accommodation, auxiliary aid, or device and the \naccommodation, auxiliary aid, or device requires repair, FDC may provide another \naccommodation, auxiliary aid, or device in lieu of repairs.  If this occurs and the Covered Inmate \nwishes to keep the original accommodation, auxiliary aid, or device, the Covered Inmate will be \nallowed to send the accommodation, auxiliary aid, or device to his or her designee. \n15.  Making Materials Available in Accessible Formats.  All materials distributed or \nmade available to inmates, including paper forms, signs, handbooks, orientation materials, \ninstructional videos, grievances, etc., must also be in accessible formats. \n16.  Procedure for Requests for Aids, Services, and Accommodations.  If an \ninmate requests an accommodation, aid, or service, the FDC will consider the request in good \nfaith, interview the inmate if necessary, and refer the inmate for a medical evaluation as needed. \nThe determination that an inmate, who has requested an accommodation, is not a Covered \nInmate shall be made only after a recommendation from a medical doctor, if appropriate, and \nwritten approval by the statewide ADA Coordinator or his or her designee.  The reasons for the \ndetermination must be documented in writing in the inmate's record. \n17.  Other Requests for Accommodation. If a Covered Inmate requests an \naccommodation, aid, or service that is not covered elsewhere in this Agreement, after a \ndetermination of need is made under the prior paragraph, FDC will provide the requested \naccommodation, aid, or service to the Covered Inmate unless ( 1) FDC has a compelling security, \nhealth, safety, or welfare concern, (2) the inmate already has an effective accommodation, (3) the \nPage 6   \n\naccommodation would cause an undue financial or administrative burden to FDC, (4) another \nreasonable and effective accommodation is available, or (5) the accommodation would constitute \na fundamental alteration of an identifiable FDC program, service, or activity.  The reasons for the \ndenial must be documented in writing in the inmate's record. \n18.  Passes.  The FDC will issue passes to Covered Inmates to implement any \naccommodations, aids, and services it has provided.  All necessary passes for Covered Inmates \nwill remain in effect even when a Covered Inmate is transferred to another facility, so that the \nCovered Inmate does not lose his or her accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services solely \nbecause of the transfer. \n19.  No Co-Pay or Charge for Accommodations.  If FDC refers a Covered Inmate \nfor a medical visit to assess the need for an accommodation, aid, or service, no medical co-pay \nwill be charged to the Covered Inmate.  No charges shall be assessed to a Covered Inmate for \naccommodations, aids, or services, including batteries to use the accommodation device, that are \nor have been previously approved by FDC. \n20.  Confiscation of Approved Accommodations.  The FDC shall not confiscate a \nCovered Inmate's approved accommodation, aid, or service or fail to renew or approve a pass for \na Covered Inmate's approved accommodation, aid, or service, unless there is a compelling \nsecurity concern.  All confiscations of Covered Inmates' approved accommodations, aids, or \ndevices must be approved by the institutional warden who will confer with an ADA Coordinator \nand the Chief Health Officer of the institution. \n21.  Work Release Centers and Re-entry Programs.  FDC will not refuse to send a \nqualified Covered Inmate to a community work release center or reentry program because the \ninmate has a mobility, hearing, or vision disability. \nPage 7   \n\n22.  Work and Educational Programming.  FDC shall not deny an otherwise \nqualified Covered Inmate access to work, vocational, or educational programming on the basis of \nthat inmate's disability.  If a Covered Inmate applies for a work position, or a vocational or \neducational opportunity, and that inmate meets the skill, experience, and education requirements, \nmedical restrictions, custody level, criminal history and time remaining on sentence \nrequirements, the FDC will not deny that individual the position or opportunity without \ndocumentation by an ADA Coordinator.  The ADA Coordinator shall document whether (1) \nFDC can make reasonable modifications in policies, practices or procedures to permit the inmate \nto meet the essential functions of the position or opportunity, and (2) the modifications \nfundamentally alter the nature of the program, service or activity.  Enrollment in courses offered \nby the Hadley School for the Blind shall not be the basis for denying an IVD inmate access to \nwork, vocational, or educational programming that is otherwise available. \n23.  PRIDE.  FDC shall not prevent a qualified Covered Inmate from participating in \nPRIDE work programs because the inmate has a mobility, hearing, or vision disability. \n24.  Natural Supports.  A Covered Inmate shall not be punished on the sole basis that \nhe or she asked another inmate for help due to his or her disability, or accepted such help, and an \ninmate shall not be punished on the sole basis that he or she provided such help. \n25.  Allegations of Retaliation or Harassment.  Allegations of retaliation or \nharassment will be promptly investigated by FDC, and appropriate action will be taken. \nIV. TRAINING \n26.  FDC Staff.

The \nFDC shall utilize reasonable efforts to consult with the Florida Department of Education \nDivision of Blind Services and the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind to develop its training \nmodules.  This training shall be provided by qualified personnel, and may be via webinar or \nonline training.  As draft written training materials for different training modules are completed, \nFDC will provide those materials to DRF.  Within nine (9) months after the Effective Date of \nthis Agreement, FDC will provide DRF with a copy of the written materials to be used for the \ntraining for DRF's feedback.  DRF will respond within thirty(30) days; however, FDC reserves \nsole discretion on the content of its training materials.  Within eleven (11) months after the \nEffective Date of this Agreement, FDC will provide DRF with a copy of any videos or online \nmaterials that may be used for the training for DRF's feedback.  DRF will respond within thirty \n(30) days; however, FDC reserves sole discretion on the content of any video or online training \nmaterials.  All staff who interact with Covered Inmates will receive a first training by July 1, \nPage 9  \n\n2019. This training will be repeated on an annual basis.  When this training becomes available, \nnew staff shall complete it as part of their initial orientation and training. \n27.  Covered Inmates.  At Reception, FDC will provide additional orientation for \nCovered Inmates that includes the following subjects, as appropriate: (A) skills training, (B) \norientation at the permanent prison, (C) the impaired inmate assistant program, (D) orientation to \naccommodations and services that are being provided (this must include information about \ndevices available at FDC prisons), (E) quarterly impaired inmate meetings, (F) FDC's ADA \ncoordinators, (G) filing requests for accommodation (including grievances and Reasonable \nModification or Accommodation Requests), (H) services provided by The Division of Blind \nServices' Talking Book Program, and (I) services provided by the Hadley School for the Blind. \nThe materials must be provided in a format that is appropriate and accessible for the individual \nCovered Inmate.  When the Covered Inmate is transferred to a permanent prison, appropriate \nADA training will be provided as needed. \nThe FDC shall facilitate general skills training for IVD inmates through the Hadley \nInstitute for the Visually Impaired and Blind, and FDC shall also offer training on the use of the \nauxiliary aids and devices that have been provided to these inmates.  The goal of this training is to \npromote independence among the IVD inmates. The FDC shall offer IVD inmates who have \ndifficulty safely and independently moving on, and negotiating, steps, curbs, terrain, and facilities, \nskills training for traveling independently.  The FDC shall also offer all Covered Inmates, as \nneeded, skills training in self-care, shaving, the safe and independent administration of medicine, \nand traveling independently. \n28.  Impaired Inmate Assistant.  Impaired Inmate Assistants (\"IIAs\") will receive \ninitial and periodic training as to their job duties and performance criteria, as well as assisting \nPage 10   \n\nCovered Inmates.  The assistance training will be designed to educate the IIAs to (A) a Covered \nInmate's needs, (B) the use and evaluation of impaired inmate assistants, (C) general information \nas to how to effectively work with Covered Inmates with disabilities, (D) functional implications \nof being deaf/hard of hearing, blind/visually impaired, or having a mobility disability; and (E) \ncommon misunderstandings about an individual's remaining sight, hearing, and mobility. \nTraining for IIAs that assist IVD inmates will also include topics such as guiding, \nassisting with talking watches, assistance in recreational activities, reading aloud, assistance at \nmeals, traveling stairs, and maintaining confidentiality of information. \nTraining for IlAs that assist with IMDs will also include topics such as safely pushing a \nwheelchair, helping someone to transfer to another seat, and assistance with daily life activities. \nV.  COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR DEAF/HARD OF HEARING INMATES \n29.  Qualified Interpreters: American Sign Language, Oral Interpreters and \nTransliterators.  A qualified sign language interpreter (\"interpreter\") is one who, via a video \nremote interpreting service or an on-site appearance, is able to interpret effectively, accurately, \nand impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. \nAn individual does not need to be registered or licensed in order to be considered to be a \nqualified sign language interpreter, but an individual holding a valid certification from the \nNational Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or the National Association of the Deaf shall be \ndeemed to be a qualified sign language interpreter.  Preference will be given to interpreters who \nhold a certification from the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or the National \nAssociation of the Deaf.  FDC will exercise reasonable efforts to utilize interpreters who hold a \ncertification from the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or the National Association \nof the Deaf in hiring or contracting with interpreters. \nPage 11  \n\n30.  Access to Qualified Interpreters: American Sign Language, Oral Interpreters \nor Transliterators.  FDC shall make available an interpreter to any D/HOH inmate whose \neffective means of communication is sign language or speech-reading/lip-reading in the \nfollowing situations: (A) medical, dental, and mental health appointments; (B) scheduled \nmeetings with classification officers; (C) education programs; (D) substance abuse programs; (E) \nintake and orientation; (F) disciplinary hearings; (G) work and job training, including at PRIDE; \n(H) religious services; (I) any training for matters that are outside the routine day-to-day schedule; \n(J) PREA training; and (K) any pre-release and re-entry instructions. \nThe phrase \"make available\" includes making an interpreter available by video remote \ninterpreting (VRI) service, or by an on-site appearance. VRI shall not be used when it is not \neffective.  FDC shall adopt a policy to implement the use of VRI for D/HOH inmates. VRI will \nnot be utilized if: \nA.  A qualified sign language interpreter is available to provide onsite interpretation; \nB.  The event at issue is long or complex; \nC.  The individual has a secondary disability (such as low vision or physical mobility) \nthat may impede the ability of the inmate to fully access the communications; and \nD.  The individual has cognitive, psychiatric, or linguistic difficulties which impede \neffective communication through VRI. \nTo the extent that FDC provides qualified interpreters via VRI services, FDC shall \nprovide: \n(1) Real-time, full-motion video and audio over a dedicated high-speed, wide \nband width video connection or wireless connection that delivers high-quality \nvideo images that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or \nirregular pauses in communication; \nPage 12   \n\n(2) A sharply delineated image that is large enough to display the interpreter's \nface, arms, hands, and fingers, and the participating individual's face, arms, hands, \nand fingers, regardless of his or her body position; \n(3) A clear, audible transmission of voices; \n(4) Adequate training to users of the technology and other involved individuals so \nthat they may quickly and efficiently set up and operate the VRI; and \n(5) Use of the VRI equipment in a location which safeguards the inmate's \nprivacy, as much as any non-disabled inmate's privacy is protected. \n31.  Use of Handcuffs.  Except when an inmate is being transported, FDC shall, as a \nreasonable accommodation, handcuff in the front D/HOH inmates whose effective means of \ncommunication is by sign language or writing, and shall only handcuff those inmates behind the \nback when there is a compelling security reason to do so.  During disciplinary hearings, FDC \nwill ensure that a D/HOH inmate whose effective means of communication is by sign language \nor writing, shall have sufficient freedom of movement for their hands. \n32.  Hearing Aids.  When a D/HOH inmate is determined by FDC to need a hearing \naid, it will be provided free of charge.  When necessary as a reasonable accommodation, bilateral \nhearing aids will be provided. The FDC shall not confiscate the hearing aids of inmates who \ncome to prison with them, but shall permit such inmates to retain and use them during their time \nin prison, unless there is a compelling security or medical reason; however, in the event that repair \nof such hearing aids is necessary, the FDC retains the option of providing the inmate with \nreplacement hearing aids.  FDC will provide training to inmates and staff on the processes to be \nused so that hearing aid batteries can be obtained free of charge.  The FDC shall repair or replace \nhearing aids within a maximum of sixty (60) days of being advised of the need, unless due to the \nseverity of the repair more time is necessary, in which event the repair shall be completed within a \nmaximum of ninety (90) days. \nPage 13   \n\n33.  Teletypewriters. Teletypewriters or a successor technology (TTYs) will be \navailable in the dormitories for those D/HOH inmates who choose to use TTY in lieu of \nVideophones, or other devices and have the capability of using them. D/HOH inmates shall be \npermitted two times the normal time to use the TTY.  The FDC shall ensure that staff is trained \non how to operate the TTYs. Broken TTYs will be repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days. \nThe TTY paper will be replaced when necessary.  While the TTY is unavailable due to needed \nrepairs, FDC will ensure that the inmate has access to another TTY.  The FDC shall ensure that \nD/HOH inmates have access to the TIPS line using TTY.  For legal calls, a TTY, for which a \nprintout will not be maintained, will be available in another location on the compound which \npermits privacy. \n34.  Telephone Amplification and Hearing Aid Compatibility. FDC shall continue \nto provide standard telephones which offer volume amplification features, and that are \ncompatible with hearing aids. \n35.  Captioned Telephone (\"CapTel\").  FDC shall provide captioned telephones \n(\"CapTel\") for inmates who (1) can speak but cannot hear on the telephone, (2) do not use sign \nlanguage to communicate, and (3) are unable to use a TTY phone, as long as the CapTel phones \ncan be used in accordance with FDC's security requirements. \n36.  Video Relay Services.  Video enabled devices shall be available in kiosks in the \ndormitories which house D/HOH inmates in the facilities listed in Exhibit A to access the Video \nRelay Service (\"VRS\") free of charge. The FDC shall ensure that staff is trained on how to \noperate the video enabled devices in the kiosks. Video enabled devices available in kiosks in the \ndorm which are broken will be repaired or replaced, within thirty (30) days.  While the video \nenabled device is unavailable due to needed repairs, FDC will ensure that the D/HOH inmate has \nPage 14   \n\naccess to another kiosk with another video enabled device in another dorm.  The video enabled \ndevices shall have the capability to access the TIPS line. The D/HOH inmates shall be permitted \ntwo times the normal time to use the video enabled device.  Further, in all the facilities listed in \nExhibit A, at least one video enabled device will be available in an area such that the call can be \nmade confidentially for legal or court related calls. \n3 7.  Alert Systems.  The FDC will install light boards and other visual alert systems in \ndormitories, which will be used to alert D/HOH inmates, whose condition prevents them from \nhearing announcements for events such as medical and legal call-outs, meal times, recreation \ntimes, counts, fire drills, and any other reason when an inmate needs to be alerted.  In addition to \nthe above, FDC will also explore other alternatives that may be used to alert D/HOH inmates to \nthe events described above. \n38.  Vibrating Watches.  FDC will utilize reasonable efforts to inform or remind the \nD/HOH inmate of necessary events or appointment \"call outs.\"  If notwithstanding that, the \nD/HOH inmate is unable to respond to necessary events or appointment \"call outs\" due to the \ninmate's hearing, a vibrating watch will be made available as an accommodation.  In addition, all \nprofoundly deaf inmates will receive a vibrating watch. \n39.  Open or Closed Captioning.  FDC is not authorized by law to purchase \ntelevisions for the recreational use of inmates, so this creates practical impediments to ensuring \nthat closed captioning exists for all television viewing; however, FDC will use reasonable efforts \nto locate television sets, which have closed captioning and place them in the dormitories where \nD/HOH inmates will be residing.  If despite using reasonable efforts, FDC is unable to locate \nsufficient numbers of these televisions, this is not a violation of this Agreement. If a television set \nis equipped with a captioning chip, the captioning must be kept on at all times.  All television sets \nPage 15   \n\npurchased by the FDC for education and wellness shall have closed captioning ability. If, after \nthis Agreement is executed, any programming is produced by FDC that is transmitted over the \ntelevision or computer, or any videos or DVDs are purchased by FDC for inmates' use (to include \nall educational or training material), the programming will be produced with captioning and the \nvideos or DVDs will have captioning. \n40.  FM Transmitters and Receivers.  In housing units designated for D/HOH \ninmates, TVs shall have FM Transmitters, and the FM transmitter will be turned on at all times \nwhen the TV is on.  Broken FM transmitters will be repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days. \nWhen a D/HOH inmate is determined by the FDC to require an FM Transmitter as a reasonable \naccommodation, receivers will be provided. FDC will provide the additional appropriate devices \nneeded to receive the FM signal. \nVI.  COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR INMATES WITH VISION DISABILITIES \n41.  Housing.  IVD inmates will be housed with reasonable access to the IIAs. \nDormitories will contain one or more dedicated charging stations for electronic accommodation \ndevices.  When IVD inmates are housed in open bay dorms, they shall receive appropriate \naccommodation for access to the bathroom, which can include orientation to the dorm, a clear \npath to the bathroom, and, if practicable, a bed close to the bathroom.  IVD inmates will not be \nhoused on the second floor of dormitories, except for compelling reasons on a temporary basis, \nor in the event of an emergency. \n42.  White Canes.  White canes will be offered as an available accommodation device \nfor those IVD inmates who are totally or legally blind, or those who have low vision and have \ndifficulty safely and independently moving on, and negotiating, steps, curbs, terrain, and \nfacilities.  The length of the white cane shall be based on an individual's height, and generally \nPage 16   \n\nshould stand at shoulder height, but the preference of the inmate will be considered.  White canes \nmust be available for replacement as soon as practicable, but no longer than two (2) weeks, and \nFDC shall provide an accommodation in the interim, as needed. \n43.  Talking Watches. FDC will utilize reasonable efforts to remind the IVD inmates \nof necessary events or appointment \"call outs.\" If, notwithstanding the reminders provided by \nFDC, and/or changes to the Call Out Lists as discussed below, the IVD inmate is unable to \nrespond to necessary events or appointment \"call outs\" due to his vision, a talking watch will be \nmade available as an accommodation.  In addition, all totally blind inmates will receive a talking \nwatch. \n44.  Key Locks.  IVD inmates will be authorized to purchase a key lock to store their \npossessions in their lockers. \n45.  Magnifiers.  Hand held magnifying glasses of various magnifications, which are \nmade of plastic, shall be available in the library for use by IVD inmates.  The library shall also \ncontain a CCTV video magnifier for use by IVD inmates.  IVD inmates who are legally blind or \nhave low vision will be permitted to have plastic magnifying sheets in the dorms as an \naccommodation. \n46.  Recorders/Players. If an IVD inmate has made a request, and has demonstrated a \nneed, to independently prepare correspondence, he will be provided with a recorder in or near the \nlibrary to dictate correspondence despite whatever other aids or devices are available.  The \nlocation will permit dictation confidentiality.  If an IVD inmate has made a request, and has \ndemonstrated a need, to independently listen to correspondence, he will be provided with a \nplayer in or near the library to listen to correspondence despite whatever other aids or devices are \navailable.

Modifications to Prisons Where IMDs Will Be Housed. \nA.  Selection of an Architect.  Within thirty (30) days after the Effective \nDate, FDC will initiate procurement of the services of a licensed architect by following \nthe procedures set forth in Florida Statute § 287.055.  The selected architect must be \nPage 20   \n\nknowledgeable with ADA requirements and standards in prisons or jails, be licensed in \nFlorida, and have experience assessing ADA accessibility in institutionalized settings. \nFDC will utilize the solicitation document that is attached as Exhibit C as the public \nannouncement for these services.  Both DRF and FDC may name one participant to the \ntwo-person selection committee that will consider which architect will be selected to \nperform the work required in this Agreement, consistent with state law procurement \nrequirements.  Both members of the selection committee will review each submitted \nproposal and evaluate them using the criteria set forth in Florida Statute § 287.055 and \nthe applicant's experience assessing ADA accessibility in institutionalized settings, and \npreliminarily score them using the methodology currently used for competitive selection \nof professional architectural services, with the goal of selecting the most highly qualified \nfirm.  The three top-ranked firms will provide public presentations, after which final \nscoring will be done by the two-person selection committee.  The scores from each \nmember of the selection committee will be averaged and the firms will be ranked \naccording to these scores.  The person selected is referred to in this Agreement as the \nArchitect. \nThe Parties intend for the Architect to be a neutral expert, and accordingly neither \nparty will have contact with him/her about this case (other than for ministerial tasks such \nas arranging travel and payment) without the other party present or included in the \ncommunication.  The Architect will be paid by FDC. \nB.  Facilities and Areas in Facilities That Mark Mazz Has Already \nInspected.  As to the facilities or areas within facilities listed in the attached Exhibit A \nwhich Mark Mazz has already inspected, and which FDC will use to house IMDs, FDC \nPage 21  \n\nwill make the modifications necessary to remedy the items listed on the attached Exhibit \nD, which is an implementation schedule for architectural modifications which the Parties \nhave agreed will be made.  The items highlighted in yellow on Exhibit D, which can be \nremedied over the short-term, will be modified no later than December 31, 2017.  The \nitems highlighted in blue, which are long-term and structural, will be modified no later \nthan June 30, 2020. \nBy April 30, 2018, the Architect will inspect and complete a written report \ndescribing whether the short-term items identified in Exhibit D have been remedied, and \nwill provide that report to DRF and FDC upon completion.  By December 31, 2020, the \nArchitect will inspect and complete a written report to determine whether the long-term \nitems identified in Exhibit D have been remedied, and will provide that report to DRF \nand FDC upon completion. FDC shall remedy any items identified by the Architect in \neither report as not being remedied within one hundred twenty (120) days ofreceiving the \nreport, but in no event, no later than April 1, 2021. \nC.  Facilities and Areas in Facilities That Mark Mazz Has Not Inspected. \nAs to the facilities or areas within the facilities listed in the attached Exhibit A which Mr. \nMazz has not inspected, and which FDC will also use to house IMDs, the Architect will \nconduct inspections in order to identify any items that do not meet ADA accessibility \nstandards in areas where inmates have access. The Architect will inspect all areas where \nany prisoner is allowed to be, enter, or remain, whether or not prisoners actually enter or \nremain in that area.  The inspections will be otherwise governed by the attached Exhibit \nE. The Parties may each send one representative, who is not an expert for either side, to \naccompany the Architect on the tour of the first facility, to ensure that the architect \nPage 22   \n\nappropriately applies ADA standards to all areas where inmates have access and inspects \nall appropriate areas.  The inspections shall be completed within two hundred ten (210) \ndays of the Effective Date.  A written report listing any items that need to be remedied \nshall be prepared and provided to both FDC and DRF upon completion.  The reports shall \nalso explain whether there were any areas the Architect was not able or not permitted to \ninspect.  DRF will confer with FDC if it believes that any areas were improperly \nexcluded from the inspection, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to \nreach an agreement about whether the Architect must re-visit a facility to inspect those \nexcluded areas.  Within sixty (60) days ofreceiving the report, FDC shall inform DRF of \nthe items that it will agree to remedy.  As to the remaining items, the Parties shall \nnegotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach an agreement on the items that will be \nmodified. The items identified by the Architect as short-term shall be completed within \ntwo hundred forty (240) days of receipt of the report. The items identified by the \nArchitect as long-term and structural will be modified no later than June 30, 2020.  FDC \nshall not be required to make any architectural modifications that would result in a \nfundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in either an \nundue financial or administrative burden (as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 35.150), or a \ncompelling security concern.  Within sixty (60) days from the designated time for \ncompletion of the short-term remedies, the Architect will conduct an inspection to \ndetermine whether the short-term items have been remedied, and shall provide a written \nreport to both FDC and DRF within sixty (60) days of those inspections.  Within sixty \n(60) days from the designated time for completion of the long-term remedies, the \nArchitect will conduct an inspection to determine whether the long-term items have been \nPage 23   \n\nremedied, and shall provide a written report to both FDC and DRF within sixty (60) days \nof those inspections.  FDC shall remedy any remaining items in either report within one \nhundred twenty (120) days of receiving the report, but in no event later than April 1, \n2021. \n58.  Wheelchairs.  An IMD, who has been determined to need a wheelchair as an \naccommodation, may keep the wheelchair he had when he entered prison, absent a documented \ncompelling security, health or safety concern. If that occurs, FDC will provide an alternative \nreasonable accommodation. \nA wheelchair will be provided to any IMD if FDC determines it is necessary as a \nreasonable accommodation.  FDC shall utilize an appropriate professional to determine the size \nand type of wheelchair. \nFDC shall conduct quarterly inspections of the wheelchairs to determine whether they \nneed repair or maintenance.  If repair or maintenance is needed, it shall be completed within \nsixty (60) days of when FDC becomes aware of the need for the repair or maintenance, unless \ndue to the_severity of the repair more time is necessary, in which event the repair shall be \ncompleted within a maximum of ninety (90) days.  In the interim, the IMD will be provided with \na \"loaner\" chair. \n59.  Prosthetic Devices.  An IMD, who has been determined to need a prosthetic \ndevice as an accommodation, may keep what he had when he entered prison, absent a \ndocumented compelling security, health or safety concern. \nA prosthetic device will be provided to any IMD if FDC determines it is necessary as a \nreasonable accommodation.  FDC shall utilize and follow the recommendations of an appropriate \nPage 24   \n\nprofessional to determine whether the device is operable, properly fitted, and to show the inmate \nhow to use the device. \nFDC shall conduct quarterly inspections of the prosthetic devices to determine whether \nthey need repair or maintenance.  If repair or maintenance is needed, it shall be completed within \nsixty (60) days of when FDC becomes aware of the need for the repair or maintenance, unless a \ndetermination is made that the prosthetic must be replaced or, due to the severity of the repair \nmore time is necessary, in which event the repair or replacement shall be completed within a \nmaximum of ninety (90) days.  In the interim, the IMD will be provided with an alternative \nreasonable accommodation. \n60.  Other Accommodations.  When an IMD is determined by FDC to require any of \nthe following as a reasonable accommodation, these accommodations shall be provided:  canes, \nwalkers, rollators, trapeze bars, orthopedic shoes and socks, braces, wedges, appropriate \nmattresses, cushions, or wheelchair gloves, so long as there is no compelling security concern.  If \nrepair or replacement is needed, it shall be completed within sixty (60) days of when FDC \nbecomes aware of the need for the repair or replacement.  In the interim, the IMD will be \nprovided with an alternative reasonable accommodation. \n61.  Bathrooms and Showers.  IMDs who have been determined to require special \naccommodations in the shower or bathroom, such as grab bars, elevated toilets, shower chairs and \nseats, shower wands, and privacy screens, shall receive those accommodations.  If repair or \nreplacement is needed, it shall be completed within sixty (60) days of when FDC becomes aware \nof the need for the repair or replacement.  Until the item is fixed and if it is required so that the \nIMD may shower or use the bathroom, the IMD will be provided access to a working shower \nPage 25   \n\nchair, grab bar, elevated toilet, shower wand, or privacy screen as needed in another dormitory as \nneeded.  FDC will permit the IMD to use a privacy screen in the ADA accessible shower. \n62.  Impaired Inmate Assistants (IIAs).  If an IMD is determined by FDC to need an \nIIA as a reasonable accommodation, the IMD shall have access to IIAs who have the ability to \npush a wheelchair and effectively assist an IMD with walking, standing, transferring, and other \ndaily life activities.  The IIAs will be periodically evaluated for fulfillment of established job \nduties and performance criteria, and any information provided by the Covered Inmate will be \nconsidered.  When an IIA is unavailable, the FDC will make another IIA available.  When not in \nspecial housing, IIAs shall be housed in the same dorm as the Covered Inmate they are assisting. \nVIII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN OF COMPLIANCE \n63.  Agreement to Implement the Plan of Compliance.  Subject to the terms of this \nAgreement, the Parties agree that the Plan of Compliance resolves all issues which have been \nraised in the Complaint, and should be implemented. \n64.  No admission.  FDC has entered into this Agreement in order to avoid the \nnecessity of trial.  Nothing in this Agreement should be construed as an admission ofliability by \nFDC, and the Agreement cannot be used as an admission by either Party in this or any other \nproceeding.  Nothing in this Agreement or FDC's compliance with this Agreement shall be \nconstrued as an admission or concession by DRF that FDC is in compliance with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, or any other statutory or constitutional provision. \n65.  Agreement is the Product of Multiple Sessions.  The Plan of Compliance, and \nthis Settlement Agreement, are the product of multiple lengthy negotiation sessions and \ncompromise by both DRF and FDC. \nPage 26   \n\n66.  Voluntary Dismissal.  Ten (10) days after the Effective Date, the Parties will file \na Stipulated Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice pursuant to Rule 4l(a)(l)(ii), Fed. R. Civ. P. \n67.  Meetings.

The first meeting will occur thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. \nThereafter, until April 30, 2021, representatives of FDC and representatives of DRF will meet in \nperson on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as agreed to by the Parties.  The meetings shall be \nheld in Tallahassee, Florida at a location chosen by FDC, although the location and City may be \nadjusted with the consent of both Parties, or the meetings may be held by phone or \nvideoconference with the consent of both Parties.  At these meetings, the Parties will discuss the \nprogress of implementation of the Plan of Compliance.  It is envisioned that free, open and frank \ndiscussions of problems, limitations and successes will further the fulfillment of the Plan of \nCompliance.  The discussions in these meetings shall not be used by either Party should \nadditional or subsequent litigation be necessary.  These meetings will also provide an \nopportunity for DRF to share any inmate specific issues (including providing inmate identifying \ndetail) that may continue to exist notwithstanding FDC's efforts to implement the Plan of \nCompliance, in order to afford FDC an opportunity to investigate and address those issues.  Four \n(4 ) weeks before the meeting- although DRF will endeavor to provide this notice as early as \npracticable- DRF will provide FDC with a report of any claimed problems or deficiencies, \ngiving as much detail as possible regarding the matter, including the date, time, place, \nidentification of any individuals involved, and a description of what occurred. \nPage 27   \n\n68.  Continued Protection and Advocacy Activities.  The Parties agree that this \nAgreement in no way limits DRF's protection and advocacy activities, and DRF may continue \nthese efforts during the implementation of the Plan of Compliance. \n69.

In addition to the regularly scheduled meetings described in paragraph 67 above, \nDRF may present, in writing, ideas or concerns to the FDC liaison, including inmate specific \nconcerns (providing as much detail as practicable under the circumstances so that the concerns \nmay be investigated, and, where appropriate, corrective action may be taken).  If DRF believes it \nneeds access to a FDC employee or agent, it will be through the FDC liaison, and any written \ncommunication will be copied to the designated counsel for FDC.  The Parties may also \ndesignate an attorney who will be copied on all communications between the liaisons.  At the \nregularly scheduled meetings, described in paragraph 67 above, the Parties shall discuss, among \nother things, the communications that occur between meetings, the results of any investigation of \nconcerns raised, and any corrective action needed to abide by the Plan of Compliance. \nCommunication at the regularly scheduled meetings and the contact with the liaison shall be the \nsole methods of exchanging information and matters of concern relating to compliance with this \nAgreement. \n70.  DRF's Access to Records.  Starting one hundred twenty (120) days after the \nEffective Date, except for documentation described in paragraph 70.D below, and continuing \nPage 28   \n\nevery one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter until the termination of this Agreement (unless \nanother time period is specified elsewhere in this Agreement), FDC will provide to ORF, at no \ncost to DRF and without a request from ORF, via email or some other electronic method, copies \nof the following records: \nA.  A report, in Excel format, listing every inmate who has been given an \n\"impairment grade\" for hearing, vision, or mobility, along with the code that has been \nassigned to that inmate. If FDC creates a new coding system that codes inmates as \nhaving a physical disability, FDC will also provide a report in Excel format that lists all \nsuch inmates. \nB.  A report, in Excel format, of all completed Reasonable Modification or \nAccommodation Request forms (currently FDC form DC2-530a and DC2-530b) \ncontaining the names and DC numbers of each inmate who submitted a request, a \nsummary of the request, the institution the inmate was at when the request was submitted, \nthe institution's recommendation regarding the request, the action taken on the request, \nand the date of the decision. \nC.  A report, in Excel format, of all disability-related grievance appeals, \ncurrently labeled as \"code 24,\" containing the Grievance Appeal case numbers, inmate \nnames and DC numbers, the institution the inmate was at when the Grievance Appeal \nwas received, when it was responded to, when it was mailed, and the disposition. \nD.  Starting six (6) months after the Effective Date, documentation of sign \nlanguage interpreter services, which provides the date, inmate name and DC number, and \ntype of event, and whether the services were in-person or via a VRI service, when sign \nlanguage interpreter services were provided to a D/HOH inmate. \nPage 29   \n\nE.  All documentation showing the confiscation of any accommodation, aid, \nor service as referenced in paragraph 20 (Confiscation of Approved Accommodations). \nEach production is an update to the prior production.

FDC will \npromptly acknowledge such requests and provide the requested records as soon as practicable \nafter receiving a request.  The attached Exhibit Fis the Business Associate Agreement which \nauthorizes FDC to disclose these records to DRF to the extent that they contain protected health \ninformation.  The Parties will comply with the attached Exhibit F.  Nothing in this paragraph \nprohibits DRF from conducting public records requests or other investigations to obtain \ninformation that may be related to this Agreement. \n71.  Confidential Legal Visits and Telephone Calls with Inmates.  DRF or its \nrepresentatives may conduct confidential legal visits or telephone calls with inmates DRF \nreasonably believes are Covered Inmates to ascertain compliance with this Agreement, as one \npart of DRF's monitoring of this Agreement.  DRF will attempt to set up such visits and calls \nthrough normal channels, but should DRF experience any difficulties, DRF will notify FDC's \ncounsel, who will attempt to intervene and assist with setting up the visit or call.  Within five (5) \ndays after such a confidential legal visit or telephone call, DRF will notify FDC's counsel and \nthe FDC liaison about the name of the inmate(s) with whom DRF or its representatives \ncommunicated, the date of the visit or call, the amount of time spent on the visit or telephone \nPage 30   \n\n\n\nenforceable as a contract in state court; however, the Parties have agreed that the sole remedy \nshould a breach of contract action be filed would be specific performance.  Before any alleged \nviolation of this Agreement is brought in state court, the Parties shall attempt to resolve the \nproblem among themselves as follows: \nAny time after eighteen (18) months following the Effective Date, if DRF believes that \nFDC has significantly breached this Agreement, the following Notice and Cure Procedures \napply: \nA.  Notice of Significant Breach.  DRF shall provide a written Notice of \nSignificant Breach to counsel for FDC alleging that FDC has significantly breached this \nAgreement and containing sufficient detail for FDC to understand the nature and scope of \nthe significant breach, to investigate it, and to take necessary corrective action. \nB.  Response to Notice of Significant Breach.  FDC shall promptly \ninvestigate and take corrective action to remedy the significant breach, and shall provide \na written response to DRF as soon as practicable but not to exceed sixty (60) days after \nreceiving the Notice of Significant Breach.  FDC's written response shall contain an \noutline of the steps FDC took to investigate the problem, the results of the investigation \nand a specific corrective action plan for addressing the stated problem.  If FDC's \nresponse includes a corrective action plan, FDC will provide to DRF a written update on \nthe status of the results of the corrective action plan every thirty (30) days until either \nparty deems the problem to be resolved or DRF seeks to enforce this Agreement.  If no \ncorrective action is anticipated, or if FDC denies a significant breach, FDC's response \nshall include the reason and any statutes, regulations or other bases upon which FDC is \nrelying. \nPage 32   \n\nC.  Reply Regarding Significant Breach.  The purpose of the Notice and \nResponse described in the two preceding paragraphs is to enable the Parties to work to \navoid DRF taking further action to enforce this Agreement.  To this end, DRF agrees to \npromptly advise FDC within fourteen (14) days ofreceipt of FDC's response whether \nDRF continues to assert that FDC has significantly breached this Agreement.  Adherence \nto the notice and cure provisions described in paragraphs 73.A to 73.C shall be a \ncondition precedent to further action to enforce this Agreement as described below. \n74.  DRF's Remedy for FDC's Alleged Significant Breach.  If, after completing the \nNotice and Cure Procedures described in paragraphs 73.A to 73.C above, DRF, in its sole \ndiscretion, believes that FDC has still significantly breached this Agreement, DRF may file a \nbreach of contract action in state court asserting a significant breach, in which event the sole \nremedy will be for specific performance.  To the extent that DRF brings such a breach of \ncontract seeking specific performance as the sole remedy, FDC will not assert sovereign \nimmunity as a defense.  FDC agrees to pay DRF's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if a \nstate court finds FDC significantly breached this Agreement.  If FDC takes an appeal and loses \nthe appeal, FDC also agrees to pay DRF's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses for the \nappeal.  If DRF has not filed a breach of contract action, this Agreement will terminate on July 6, \n2021.  If a breach of contract action is pending as of July 6, 2021, the termination of the specific \nterms of the Agreement referenced in the breach of contract action shall be tolled. \n75.  Effect of DRF's Inaction or Action With Respect To A Suit To Enforce. \nFailure by the DRF to enforce this entire Agreement or any provision thereof with regard to any \ndeadline or any other provision herein shall not be construed as a waiver of the DRF's right to \nenforce other deadlines and provisions of this Agreement provided DRF complies with the \nPage 33   \n\nNotice and Cure Provisions in paragraph 73 above.  Moreover, if DRF seeks to enforce certain \nprovisions in this Agreement by bringing a breach of contract action, and not seeking \nenforcement of other provisions at the same time, seeking enforcement of select provisions of \nthis Agreement does not void the unchallenged terms of the Agreement and it remain in full \nforce and effect throughout the entire term of this Agreement.  Furthermore, DRF is not \nprohibited from bringing multiple breach of contract actions against the FDC should it be \nnecessary. \nX.  OTHER PROVISIONS \n76.  Authentication of Documents.  If DRF files a breach of contract action, the \nParties agree that any documents or reports provided by either Party pursuant to this Agreement \nshall be deemed to be authenticated. \n77.  Attorney's Fees and Costs. Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, FDC \nshall pay to DRF the sum of two million U.S. dollars($ 2,000,000), in full payment of attorneys' \nfees and costs accrued through the Effective Date, via check made payable to Disability Rights \nFlorida, Inc.  This payment shall be nonrefundable.  DRF hereby releases and discharges FDC of \nand from any claims or causes of action arising out of payment of attorneys' fees and costs \naccrued through the Effective Date. \n78.  Modification of the Manner in Which FDC Provides Accommodations to \nCovered Inmates.  FDC specifically reserves the right to change, alter, amend, or rescind the \nmanner in which it treats Covered Inmates, to the extent that such.a mendments, alterations, or \nchanges are required by federal law in order to retain or obtain federal funding or to avoid \nfederal sanctions. If DRF believes FDC has violated any constitutional, statutory, regulatory, or \nother legal provision in a manner that is not covered by this Agreement, DRF specifically \nPage 34   \n\nreserves the right to bring a separate action against the official capacity agency head of FDC for \nsuch alleged violation and FDC agrees to not raise the defense of collateral estoppel or res \njudicata in an action for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief. \n79.  Modification of Agreement.  Should the Parties in the future jointly determine to \nmodify any provision of this Agreement, any modifications must be reduced to writing and \nsigned by both Parties. No modification shall take effect unless it is reduced to writing and \nsigned by both Parties.  These actions must receive the prior written approval of both Parties, \nwhich approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. \n80.  Force Majeure Clause.  Should a war, riot, fire, flood, hurricane, typhoon, \nearthquake, lightning, explosion, strike, lockout, pandemic, or prolonged shortage of energy \nsupplies substantially impede FDC in its compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement, or \nsubstantially impede FDC's timely compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement, the \nParties agree that the failure to comply or comply timely shall be excused and shall not be \nconsidered a failure to meet the terms of the General Plan of Compliance.  Should any of the \nevents in this paragraph occur and substantially impede compliance, FDC shall make reasonable \nefforts to restore or alternatively achieve compliance as soon as it is possible to do so. \n81.  Agreement Binding on Successors.  It is the intent of the Parties that this \nAgreement shall be binding upon the Parties, and their successors, assigns, employees, \ncontractors and agents. \n82.  Agreement Constitutes Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including any \nattachments, constitutes the entire Agreement of the Parties with respect to its subject matter and \nsupersedes any and all other prior agreements and all negotiations leading up to the execution of \nthis Agreement, whether oral or written, regarding the subject covered in this Agreement.

The architect will inspect those dormitories where mobility disabled prisoners are \nhoused, and all other areas where prisoners are allowed, or where they are allowed to enter or \nremain, along with the pathways to and from those areas. This includes but is not limited to cells, \nday rooms, common rooms, chow halls, recreation rooms, medical areas, mental health areas, \nbathrooms,  showers,  close  management  areas,  disciplinary  confinement  areas,  protective \nmanagement areas, education rooms, rooms where religious services are held, counseling or \nsubstance abuse meeting rooms, medication lines, hallways, classification rooms and areas, \nsidewalks connecting different areas of the facility (interior and exterior), outdoor recreation \nspaces, sick  call areas,  infirmaries, hospitals or hospital-like areas, visitation areas, outside \ngrounds,  attorney  meeting  rooms,  telephone  areas,  TTY/TDD  areas,  television  areas, \nPage 1 of 4 \n \n\nprogramming and vocational areas, food lines, prisoner transportation vehicles, and work areas. \nHowever, the architect will not be permitted to enter, view, and inspect any areas that require the \nextraction of inmates from a confinement cell unless the extraction can be achieved within a \nreasonable amount of time and in accordance with the institution’s safety and security needs.  In \naddition, the architect will not be permitted to enter, view, and inspect dorms (unless they are \nopen bay), bathrooms, or showers that are in active use by inmates, and will not be permitted to \nenter, view, and inspect any areas that are in active use by inmates for medical exams and \ntreatment, counseling, or substance abuse prevention.  This restriction shall not pertain to day \nrooms. To increase the efficiency and decrease the disruptiveness of the inspection, FDC will \nmake reasonable efforts to coordinate the sequence of the inspections so that the areas are empty \nand not in use during the inspection.  If any area cannot be inspected because of the above \nsecurity or privacy issues, FDC will make reasonable efforts to permit the architect to view and \ninspect that area by the end of that day’s inspection. \n2.  Each inspection can be attended by a non-expert representative from Disability \nRights Florida (“DRF”).  This individual will be permitted to accompany the architect during the \ninspection.   \n3.  DRF will provide the FDC’s designed liaison the representative’s full name, sex, \nrace, home address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license \nnumber, and, if applicable, Florida Bar number, at least ten (10) business days before each \ninspection, so that FDC can conduct a security background check. \n4.  The representative from DRF will be required to adhere to all portions of FDOC \nProcedure 602.016 that apply to visitors or contractors, which is attached hereto.  If any term of \nthese procedures conflicts with Procedure 602.016, these procedures shall govern.  \nPage 2 of 4 \n \n\n5.  Each inspection may also be attended by the following from FDC: a non-expert \nrepresentative of FDC, the warden of the facility or his designee(s), and one or more additional \nFDC employees from FDC’s headquarters in Tallahassee.    \n  6.  On the day of the inspection, DRF’s representative will arrive at the prison at 7:30 \na.m., with the goal of starting the inspections at 8 a.m.  The inspections will normally conclude \nby 6:00 p.m., unless interrupted by an institution lock-down that occurred at some point during \nthe inspection.   \n  7.  The architect will be escorted by at least one FDC staff member who can guide \nthe architect through the prison, and respond to questions that relate to an identification of the \nareas inspected and their uses, the number and classification of inmates who are typically in that \narea, or the approximate date that the prison or area was built or altered.   \n  8.  DRF’s representative will not be prohibited from conversing with prisoners, but \nwill  not  initiate,  seek  out,  and  actively  engage  in  interviews  with  prisoners,  and  such \nconversations will not be permitted to delay the inspection.     \n  9.  The architect will be permitted to take measurements, and will be permitted to \nbring into the facility a tape measure, level, and clipboard for that purpose.   \n  10.  The architect and DRF’s representative will be permitted to take notes during the \ninspection, and will be permitted to bring pens, notepads, and paper into the facility for this \npurpose.  FDC will not be permitted to view DRF’s representative’s notes at that time, although \nthe representative’s notes may be discoverable at a later time pursuant to applicable rules of civil \nprocedure.  \n  11.    The  architect  will  be  permitted  to  bring  into  the  facility  a  copy  of  the  plans, \ndrawings, or other documents depicting the layout of the facility; however, the architect will not \nPage 3 of 4 \n \n\nshow these documents to any prisoner, and will allow the FDC to review them prior to leaving \nthe institution in order for FDC to verify that all such plans, drawings, or other documents \nremain in the possession of the architect.   \n  12.  The architect will be permitted to take photographs of anything in the facility that is \nreasonably  related  to  the  inspection  and  will  be  permitted  to  bring  a  digital  camera  (with \nbatteries) into the facility for this purpose.  Photographs of FDC staff will not be taken.  The \narchitect  will  make  every  effort  to  avoid  capturing  prisoners  in  photographs;  however,  if \nprisoners are captured in a photograph, the architect will edit the photographs after the inspection \nto blur their faces before any such photograph is used for any purpose in this case.   \n  13. At the end of the inspection of any area where pictures were taken, and before \nmoving to another area, as well as at end of each day’s inspection, FDC will be permitted to \nreview all photographs taken by the architect to determine if any photograph presents a security \nissue.  If FDC wants the architect to delete a photograph, the architect will be permitted to take a \nnew photograph depicting the same area of the deleted photograph that attempts to address the \nsecurity concern.    \nPage 4 of 4 \n \n\nEXHIBIT F \n \nBUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN \n \nTHE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS \nAND \nDISABILITY RIGHTS FLORIDA, INC. \n \nThis  Business  Associate  Agreement  (“Agreement”)  is  made  between  the  Florida  Department  of \nCorrections (“Department”) and Disability Rights Florida, Inc.

The representative will be permitted to take notes during the inspection, and will be \npermitted to bring pens, notepads, and paper into the facility for this purpose.  FDC will not be \npermitted to view the representative’s notes at that time, although the representative’s notes may \nbe discoverable at a later time pursuant to applicable rules of civil procedure.  \nB.

Standards  for  Medical  Diagnostic  Equipment,  Federal  Register  Vol.  82,  No.  5  Monday,  January \n5,  2017,  pages  2810  -  2848 \nMethodology  for  Applying  the  Accessibility  Standards: \nI  have  30-plus  years’  experience  as  an  architect  and  as  an  architectural  accessibility  consultant.  My \nwork  includes  reviews  of correctional  facilities  in  about  10  states,  as  well  as  other  Section  504  and \nADA  Title  II  barriers  assessment  and  transition  plans.  Also,  I  was  employed  for  three  years  as  an \narchitect  in  the  Disabilities  Rights  Section  of DOJ’s  Civil  Rights  Division.  In  this  practice,  I  have \nassessed  facilities’  compliance  with  the  standards  and  for  providing  “program  access”  (that  is, \naccess  to  services,  programs,  and  activities).  In  my  experience,  in  order  to  comply  with  the \nprogram  access  requirements  of Section  504  and  the  ADA,  a  public  entity  must  provide  access  to \nservices,  programs,  and  activities  (program  access)  in  spaces  that  comply  with  applicable  standards. \nI  developed  my  opinion  about  whether  the  Florida Prisons  are  accessible  to  inmates  with  disabilities \nby  using  the  accessibility  standards  referenced  by  the  US  Department  of Justice  (DOJ). \nIn  my  experience,  the  DOJ  Section  504  regulations  require  new  construction,  additions,  or \nalterations  constructed  after  March  7,  1988  to  comply  with  the  Uniform  Federal  Accessibility \nStandards  (UFAS). \n28  C.F.R.  §  42.522  New  construction. \n(a)  Design and construction.  Each new  facility  constructed by,  on behalf of,  or for the use  of a recipient shall \nbe  designed and constructed in  such a manner that the  facility 1s readily  accessible to  and usable by \nhandicapped persons,  if the  construction was  commenced after the  effective  date  of this  subpart.  Any \nalterations to  existing  facilities  shall,  to the maximum extent feasible,  be made in an accessible manner. \n(b)  Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility  Standards.  (1)  Effective  as  of March 7,  1988,  design, \nconstruction,  or alteration of buildings  in conformance with  sections  3—8  of the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards  (UFAS)  (appendix A to 41  CFR subpart  101—19.6)  shall be  deemed to  comply with the requirements \nof this  section with respect to those buildings.  Departures  from particular technical  and  scoping requirements \nof UFAS  by the use  of other methods  are permitted where  substantially  equivalent or greater access to  and \nusability of the building 1s provided. \nThe  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  Title  II  regulations  require  new  construction,  additions, \nor  alterations  constructed  on  or  after  January  26,  1992  and  before  March  15,  2012  to  comply  with \neither  UFAS,  the  1991  ADA  Standards,  or  the  2010  ADA  Standards.  Where  a  space  or  element  is \nnot  expressly  addressed  in  the  1991  ADA  Standards,  the  space  or  element  must  comply  with  the \n2010  ADA  Standards.  New  construction,  additions,  or  alterations  constructed  on  or  after  March  15, \n2012  must  comply  with  the  2010  ADA  Standards. \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.151  New  construction and alterations \n(a)  Design and construction. \n(1)  Each facility  or part of a facility constructed by,  on behalf of,  or for the use  of a public  entity  shall be \ndesigned and constructed in such manner that the  facility  or part of the  facility is readily  accessible to  and \nusable by individuals with disabilities,  if the  construction was  commenced after January 26,  1992. \n(2)  Exception for structural  impracticability. \n3 \n Architecture  Consulting   Barrier-Free  Design \n4016  Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781  301-440-4276  301-263-6868 Fax  mark.j.mazz@verizon.net\nCase  4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS  Document  62-31  Filed  01/30/17  Page  4  of  130 \n(1) Full  compliance with the requirements  of this  section 1s not required where  a public  entity  can demonstrate \nthat it 1s  structurally impracticable to meet the requirements.  Full  compliance will be  considered  structurally \nimpracticable  only in those rare  circumstances when the unique  characteristics  of terrain prevent the \nincorporation of accessibility  features. \n(11)  If full  compliance with this  section would be  structurally impracticable,  compliance with this  section is \nrequired to the  extent that it 1s not structurally impracticable.  In that case,  any portion of the  facility that can be \nmade  accessible  shall be made  accessible to the  extent that it is not structurally impracticable. \n(11)  If providing accessibility in conformance with this  section to  individuals with certain disabilities  (e.g., \nthose who use wheelchairs) would be  structurally impracticable,  accessibility  shall nonetheless be  ensured to \npersons with other types  of disabilities,  (e.g., those who use  crutches  or who have  sight, hearing,  or mental \nimpairments) in accordance with this  section. \n(b) Alterations. \n(1)  Each facility  or part of a facility  altered by,  on behalf of,  or for the use  of a public  entity in a manner that \naffects  or could affect the usability of the  facility  or part of the  facility  shall,  to the maximum extent feasible, \nbe  altered in  such manner that the  altered portion of the  facility 1s readily accessible to  and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities,  if the  alteration was  commenced after January 26,  1992. \n(c) Accessibility  standards  and compliance  date. \n(1)  If physical  construction or alterations  commence  after July 26,  1992, but prior to the  September  15,  2010, \nthen new  construction and alterations  subject to this  section must comply with either the UFAS  or the  1991 \nStandards  except that the  elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5)  and  section 4.1.6(1)(k)  of the  1991 \nStandards  shall not apply.  Departures  from particular requirements  of either standard by the use  of other \nmethods  shall be permitted when it is  clearly  evident that equivalent access to the  facility or part of the  facility \nis thereby provided. \n(2)  If physical  construction or alterations  commence  on or after  September  15,  2010,  and before  March  15, \n2012,  then new  construction and alterations  subject to this  section may  comply with one  of the  following:  the \n2010  Standards,  UFAS,  or the  1991  Standards  except that the  elevator exemption contained at  section 4.1.3(5) \nand section 4.1.6(1)(k)  of the  1991  Standards  shall not apply.  Departures  from particular requirements  of either \nstandard by the use  of other methods  shall be permitted when it 1s  clearly evident that equivalent access to the \nfacility  or part of the  facility is thereby provided. \n(3)  If physical  construction or alterations  commence  on or after March  15,  2012,  then new  construction and \nalterations  subject to this  section  shall  comply with the 2010  Standards. \n(4)  For the purposes  of this  section,  ceremonial groundbreaking  or razing  of structures prior to  site preparation \ndo not commence physical  construction or alterations. \n(5) Noncomplying new  construction and alterations. \n(1) Newly  constructed or altered facilities  or elements  covered by  §§  35.151(a)  or (b) that were  constructed or \naltered before March  15,  2012,  and that do not comply with the  1991  Standards  or with UFAS  shall before \nMarch  15,  2012,  be made  accessible  in accordance with either the  1991  Standards,  UFAS,  or the 2010 \nStandards. \n(11) Newly  constructed or altered facilities  or elements  covered by  §§  35.151(a)  or (b) that are  constructed or \naltered on or after March  15,  2012,  and that do not comply with the  1991  Standards  or with UFAS  shall,  on or \nafter March  15,  2012,  be made  accessible  in accordance with the 2010  Standards. \nSince  September  15,  2010,  the  ADA  Title  I  regulations  require  accessible  cells  to  comply  with  the \n2010  ADA  Standards. \n28  C.F.R.  §35.151(k) Detention and correctional  facilities. \n(1) New  construction of jails,  prisons,  and other detention and correctional  facilities  shall  comply with the \n2010  Standards  except that public  entities  shall provide  accessible mobility features  complying with section \n807.2  of the  2010  Standards  for a minimum of 3%,  but no  fewer than one,  of the total number of cells ina \nfacility.

However,  when alterations  are made to  specific  cells, \ndetention and correctional  facility operators may  satisfy their obligation to provide the required number of cells \nwith mobility  features by providing the required mobility  features  in substitute  cells  (cells  other than those \nwhere  alterations  are  originally planned),  provided that each  substitute  cell— \n(1)  Is located within the  same prison site; \n(11)  Is  integrated with other cells to the maximum extent feasible; \n(111) Has,  at a minimum,  equal physical  access  as the  altered cells to  areas used by inmates  or detainees  for \nvisitation,  dining, recreation,  educational programs,  medical  services,  work programs,  religious  services,  and \nparticipation in other programs that the  facility offers to  inmates  or detainees;  and, \n(iv)  Ifit is technically infeasible to  locate  a substitute  cell within the  same prison  site,  a  substitute  cell must be \nprovided at another prison site within the  corrections  system. \n(3)  With respect to medical  and long-term care  facilities  in jails,  prisons,  and other detention and correctional \nfacilities,  public  entities  shall  apply the 2010  Standards technical  and  scoping requirements  for those  facilities \nirrespective  of whether those  facilities  are  licensed. \n§  35.152  Jails,  detention and correctional  facilities,  and community  correctional  facilities. \n(a)  General.  This  section applies to public  entities that are responsible  for the  operation or management of adult \nand juvenile justice jails,  detention and correctional  facilities,  and community  correctional  facilities,  either \ndirectly  or through contractual,  licensing,  or other arrangements with public  or private  entities,  in whole  or in \npart,  including private  correctional  facilities. \n(b) Discrimination prohibited. \n(1)  Public  entities  shall  ensure that qualified inmates  or detainees with disabilities  shall not,  because  a facility \nis  inaccessible to  or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be  excluded from participation in,  or be  denied \nthe benefits  of,  the  services, programs,  or activities  of a public  entity,  or be  subjected to  discrimination by any \npublic  entity. \n(2)  Public  entities  shall  ensure that inmates  or detainees with disabilities  are housed in the most integrated \nsetting  appropriate to the needs  of the  individuals.  Unless  it is  appropriate to make  an exception,  a public \nentity— \n(1)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities in inappropriate  security  classifications because no \naccessible  cells  or beds  are  available; \n(11)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  in designated medical  areas unless they  are  actually \nreceiving medical  care  or treatment; \n(111)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  in facilities that do not offer the  same programs  as the \nfacilities where they would otherwise be housed;  and \n(iv)  Shall not deprive  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  of visitation with family members by placing them \nin distant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed. \n(3)  Public  entities  shall implement reasonable policies,  including physical modifications to  additional  cells  in \naccordance with the 2010  Standards,  so  as to  ensure that each inmate with a disability is housed in a cell with \nthe  accessible  elements necessary to  afford the  inmate  access to  safe,  appropriate housing. \nAlso,  portions  of facilities  that  have  not  been  altered  since  March  7,  1988  must  comply  with  Section \n504  §42.521. \n28  C.F.R.  §  42.521  Existing facilities. \n(a) Accessibility.  A recipient shall  operate  each program or activity to which this  subpart applies  so that when \neach part is viewed in its  entirety it 1s readily  accessible to  and usable by handicapped persons.  This  section \ndoes not require  a recipient to make  each of its  existing facilities  or every part of a facility accessible to  and \nusable by handicapped persons. \n(b)  Compliance procedures.  A recipient may  comply with the requirement of paragraph (a)  of this  section \nthrough acquisition or redesign of equipment,  reassignment of services to  accessible buildings,  assignment of \naids to beneficiaries,  delivery of services  at alternate  accessible  sites,  alteration of existing facilities,  or any \n5 \n  \nArchitecture  Consulting  Barrier-Free  Design \n4016  Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781  301-440-4276  301-263-6868 Fax  mark.j.mazz@verizon.net\nCase  4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS  Document  62-31  Filed  01/30/17  Page  6  of  130 \nother method that results  in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons.  A recipient is \nnot required to make  structural  changes in existing  facilities where  other methods  are  effective in achieving \ncompliance with paragraph (a)  of this  section.  In choosing  among methods  for meeting the requirement of \nparagraph (a)  of this  section,  a recipient shall give priority to those methods that  serve handicapped persons  in \nthe most integrated  setting  appropriate. \nPortions  of facilities  that  have  not  been  altered  since  January  26,  1992  must  comply  with  ADA \n§35.150(a)  and  §35.152. \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.150  Existing  facilities \n(a)  General.  A public  entity  shall  operate  each  service,  program,  or activity  so that the  service,  program,  or \nactivity,  when viewed in its  entirety,  1s readily  accessible to  and usable by individuals with disabilities.  This \nparagraph does not— \n(1) Necessarily require  a public  entity to make  each of its  existing facilities  accessible to  and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities; \n(2) Require  a public  entity to take  any  action that would threaten or destroy the historic  significance  of an \nhistoric property;  or \n(3) Require  a public  entity to take  any  action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental  alteration in \nthe nature  of a service, program,  or activity or in undue  financial  and administrative burdens.  In those \ncircumstances where personnel  of the public  entity believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter \nthe  service,  program,  or activity  or would result in undue  financial  and administrative burdens,  a public  entity \nhas the burden of proving that compliance with  §35.150(a)  of this part would result in  such alteration or \nburdens.  The  decision that compliance would result in  such alteration or burdens must be made by the head of \na public  entity or his  or her designee  after considering  all resources  available  for use in the  funding  and \noperation of the  service,  program,  or activity,  and must be  accompanied by  a written  statement of the reasons \nfor reaching that conclusion.  If an action would result in  such an alteration or such burdens,  a public  entity \nshall take  any other action that would not result in  such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless \nensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits  or services provided by the public  entity. \nb) Methods. \n(1)  General.  A public  entity may  comply with the requirements  of this  section through such means  as redesign \nor acquisition of equipment,  reassignment of services to  accessible buildings,  assignment of aides to \nbeneficiaries,  home visits,  delivery of services  at alternate  accessible  sites,  alteration of existing  facilities  and \nconstruction of new  facilities, use  of accessible rolling  stock  or other conveyances,  or any other methods that \nresult in making its  services,  programs,  or activities readily accessible to  and usable by individuals with \ndisabilities.  A public  entity is not required to make  structural  changes in existing facilities where  other methods \nare  effective  in achieving compliance with this  section.  A public  entity,  in making  alterations to  existing \nbuildings,  shall meet the  accessibility requirements  of §  35.151.  In choosing  among  available methods  for \nmeeting the requirements  of this  section,  a public  entity  shall give priority to those methods that offer  services, \nprograms,  and activities to  qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated  setting  appropriate. \nThese  sections  require  a public  entity  to  operate  each  service,  program,  or  activity  so  that the \nservice,  program,  or  activity,  when  viewed  in  its  entirety,  1s  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by \nindividuals  with  disabilities.  Services,  programs,  and  activities  (1.e.  program  access)  include \nhousing  in  different  levels  of confinement,  such  as  minimum  security,  medium  security,  and \nmaximum  security.  It  also  includes  access  to  recreational  facilities,  classrooms,  libraries, \ncomputers,  work  programs,  visitation  areas,  mailrooms,  commissaries,  and  other  areas.  Facilities \ndesignated  for  accessible  services,  programs,  and  activities  must  comply  with  alterations  provisions \nof UFAS,  the  1991  ADA  Standards,  or  the  2010  ADA  Standards  (35.150(b)).  (ADA  Title  II \nregulations,  page  202) \nIn choosing  among methods,  the public  entity  shall give priority  consideration to those that will be  consistent \nwith provision of services in the most integrated  setting appropriate to the needs  of individuals with \n6 \n Architecture  Consulting   Barrier-Free  Design \n4016  Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781  301-440-4276  301-263-6868 Fax  mark.j.mazz@verizon.net\nCase  4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS  Document  62-31  Filed  01/30/17  Page  7  of  130 \ndisabilities.  Structural  changes in existing  facilities  are required only when there  is no  other feasible way to \nmake the public  entity's program accessible.  (It should be noted that  \"structural  changes\"  include  all physical \nchanges to  a facility;  the term does not refer only to  changes to  structural  features,  such as removal  of or \nalteration to  a loadbearing  structural member.)  The requirements  of §35.151  for alterations  apply to  structural \nchanges undertaken to  comply with this  section.  The public  entity may comply with the program accessibility \nrequirement by delivering  services  at alternate  accessible  sites  or making home visits  as  appropriate. \nWhere  inmates  use  facilities  independently,  program  access  requires  that  inmates  with  disabilities, \nto  the  extent  feasible,  also  be  permitted  to  use  these  facilities  independently.  Therefore,  physical \nbarriers  that  block  independent  access  must  be  removed.  Here  are  some  examples.  There  must  be \nsufficient  clear  floor  space  around  the  toilet  to  facilitate  an  independent transfer.  The  shower  must \nbe  on  an  accessible  route,  have  sufficient  clear  floor  space,  have  accessible  controls  and  grab  bars, \nand  provide  the  same  level  of privacy.  And,  recreational  equipment  must  be  on  an  accessible  route. \nUFAS  Section  4.1.4(9)(b)  requires  5%  of the  residential  units  and  all  common  use  areas  be  made \naccessible.  The  ADA  requires  each  detention  and  correctional  facility  to  provide  accessible \nmobility  features  in  at  least  3%  of its  cells  (§  35.151(k)(1)).  The  accessible  cells  must  be  distributed \namong  the  types  of cells. \nAccessible  housing  cells  must  be  in  the  most  integrated  setting  that  is  appropriate  to  the  needs  of the \ninmate.  Section  35.152(b)(2)  uses  the  following  criteria: \n“(1)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  in inappropriate  security  classifications because no \naccessible  cells  or beds  are  available; \n(11)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  in designated medical  areas unless they  are  actually \nreceiving medical  care  or treatment; \n(111)  Shall not place  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  in facilities that do not offer the  same programs  as the \nfacilities where they would otherwise be housed;  and \n(iv)  Shall not deprive  inmates  or detainees with disabilities  of visitation with family members by placing them \nin distant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed.” \nProgram  Access: \nTo  review  for  program  access,  one  must  know  all  the  services,  programs,  and  activities  provided  by \nFDC.  Program  access  is  not  limited  to  each  of the  custody,  medical,  and  psychological  grades.  It \nalso  includes  access  to  all  the  academic,  vocational,  substance  abuse,  community,  religious, \nbetterment,  recreation,  P.R.I.D.E.,  and  work  programs  to  the  degree  that  it would  not  fundamentally \nalter  the  program.  For  example,  vocational  training  might  not  include  farm  work,  but  it  could \ninclude  a  commercial  driver’s  license,  cooking,  or  being  a technical  support  specialist.  It  also \nincludes  all  methods  for  achieving  gaintime.  It  includes  canine  programs. \nDuring  my  surveys,  I  was  told  repeatedly  that  inmates  in  wheelchairs  were  not  allowed  to  work  in \nthe  kitchens,  libraries,  and  canteens.  Those  areas  were  not  surveyed.  There  appears  to  be  no \nmeaningful  work  opportunities  if an  inmate  used  a wheelchair. \nI  plan  to  address  the  physical  access  to  programs  in  a  supplemental  report. \n7 \n  \nArchitecture  Consulting  Barrier-Free  Design \n4016  Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781  301-440-4276  301-263-6868 Fax  mark.j.mazz@verizon.net\nCase  4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS  Document  62-31  Filed  01/30/17  Page  8  of  130 \nMedical  Equipment: \nMedical  equipment  must  be  accessible  to  provide  program  access.  (35.150(a)  and  (b)  and  Federal \nRegister  Vol.  75,  No.  178,  September  15,  2010,  page  56235).  I  saw  no  lifts  or  adjustable  height \nexam  tables.  Although  other  facilities  had  scales,  the  only  scale  for  an  inmate  in  a wheelchair  is  in \nthe  Reception  and  Medical  Center  (RMC).  Although  there  are  medical  facilities  at  each  location \nthatI  surveyed,  none  except  the  RMC  appear  to  address  any  accessibility  issues. \nI  plan  to  address  access  to  medical  facilities  and  equipment  in  a  supplemental  report. \nDeviations  from  the  Standards: \nIn  my  experience,  Section  504  and  the  ADA  permit  deviating  from  the  Standards  when  compliance \nwith  the  Standards  is  structurally  impracticable  or  technically  infeasible.  The  ADA  defines \nstructurally  impracticable  is  applied  rarely  when  unique  characteristics  of terrain  prevent the \nincorporation  of accessible  features: \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.151  New  construction and alterations \n(2)  Exception for structural  impracticability. \n(1) Full  compliance with the requirements  of this  section 1s not required where  a public  entity  can demonstrate \nthat it 1s  structurally impracticable to meet the requirements.  Full  compliance will be  considered  structurally \nimpracticable  only in those rare  circumstances when the unique  characteristics  of terrain prevent the \nincorporation of accessibility  features. \nThe  correctional  facilities  are  on  a  large,  mostly  flat  land.  The  few  older  facilities  with  gentle \nslopes  have  sufficient  space  to  provide  ramps.  None  of the  facilities  were  raised  significantly  above \nthe  natural  grade.  The  terrain  does  not  prevent the  incorporation  of accessible  features.  Therefore, \nnone  of my  findings  are  structurally  impracticable  to  modify  to  make  accessible. \nThe  ADA  Standards  define  technically  infeasible  as: \nTechnically  Infeasible.  With respect to  an alteration of a building  or a facility,  something that has little \nlikelihood of being  accomplished because  existing  structural  conditions would require removing or altering  a \nload-bearing member that is  an essential part of the  structural  frame;  or because  other existing physical  or  site \nconstraints prohibit modification or addition of elements,  spaces,  or features that are in full  and  strict \ncompliance with the minimum requirements. \nIf something  is  technically  infeasible,  the  ADA  Standards  still  requires  accessibility  to  the \nmaximum  extent  feasible: \n202.3  Alterations.

In alterations,  where  compliance with applicable requirements is technically infeasible, the  alteration  shall \ncomply with the requirements to the maximum extent feasible. \nFor  example,  if a  designated  accessible  housing  cell  cannot  be  widened  to  accommodate  60”- \ndiameter  turning  space,  the  window  controls  and  the  toilet  facilities  must  still  be  modified  to \ncomply. \nI  did  not  report  in  my  findings  barriers  whose  only  remedy  would  require  removing  or  altering  load- \nbearing  member  that  is  an  essential  part  of the  structural  frame.  Therefore,  none  of my  findings  are \ntechnically  infeasible  to  modify  to  make  accessible. \nStandards  used  During  Survey: \nThese  facilities  were  built  before  July  26,  1992.  I  could  not  determine  which  parts  may  have  been \nbuilt  or  altered  after  March  7,  1988.  Therefore,  I  could  not  determine  where  the  UFAS  new \nconstruction  requirements  would  apply.  Except to  the  number  of accessible  cells  that  are  required, \nUFAS  has  substantially  the  same  requirements  as  1991  ADA  Standards.  In  thatI   only  looked  at \nparts  used  by  inmates  with  disabilities,  I  used  the  1991  ADA  Standards.  I  used  the  2010  ADA \nStandards  where  supplemental  scoping  or  technical  requirements  for  detention  facilities  are \nprovided: \n1.  Lowell  Correctional  Institution \n2.

Therefore,  I  could  not  determine \nwhere  the  UFAS  new  construction  requirements  would  apply.  Significant  parts  appear  to  have  been \naltered  after  July  26,  1992.

For  example,  the \nseven  facilities  built  after  July  26,  1992  and  any  alterations  made  in  the  other  three  facilities  after \nJuly  26,  1992  must  comply  with  the  ADA  Standards.  Any  areas  not  used  by  inmates  with \ndisabilities  were  not  surveyed.  Additionally,  areas  that  may  be  required  by  program  access  but were \nnot  available  to  inmates  with  disabilities  were  not  surveyed.  For  example,  areas  where  inmates \nwork  and  areas  used  by  visitors  with  disabilities  were  not  surveyed. \nI  surveyed  a  sampling  of repetitive  spaces.  For  example,  where  all  the  classrooms  appeared  to  be \nthe  same  I  surveyed  only  one.  I  surveyed  representative  samples  of the  housing  cells  and  dorms \nused  by  inmates  with  disabilities  regardless  of custody  grades  or  confinement  or  punitive  status. \nTherefore,  where  a report  a barrier  in  a particular  space,  that  barrier  may  occur  several  times  in \nseveral  similar  spaces. \nFacilities  reviewed  are: \n1.

I-Dorm \nil.  Lowell  Correctional  Institution  Annex \n1.  Common  use  areas  for  inmates \n2.  N-Dorm,  T-Dorm \nUsing  the  ADA  Standards,  I  measured  the  areas  listed  above  including  the  route  to  these  areas  and \nall  ancillary  spaces  and  features  that  inmates  use  such  as  toilet  rooms  and  drinking  fountains. \nWhere  possible,  I  took  several  photos  of each  barrier to  show  the  context  of the  barrier  and  the \nactual  measurement.  Barriers  that  I  found  in  the  September  and  October  site  surveys  are  listed  in \nthe  chart  in  Attachment  2.  In  that  I  surveyed  a  sampling  of repetitive  spaces,  not  all  barriers  are \nlisted  in  the  chart. \nI  plan  to  address  the  barriers  found  in  the  January  site  visits  in  a  supplemental  report.  In  the \nWakulla  Correctional  Institution  and  Annex,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  survey  parts  of the  facilities \nthat  are  not  used  by  inmates  with  disabilities  but were  constructed  after  January  26,  1992.  I  also \nplan  to  address  these  barriers  in  a  supplemental  report. \nThe  charts  have  four  or  five  columns.  “Citation  for  Remediation”  provides  the  2010  ADA \nStandards  citation  for  remediation,  since  remediation  will  occur  after  the  effective  date  of March  15, \n2012.  For  facilities  where  construction  started  after  March  15,  2012,  it  1s  also  the  non-compliance \ncitation.  “Citation  for Non-Compliance”  provides  the  ADA  Standards  citation  non-compliance. \n“Description/Issue/Requirement”  states  the  requirement.  “Barriers”  identifies  how  it  does  not \ncomply.  And,  “Photos”  references  the  photos  that  show  the  location  and  non-complying \nmeasurement.  The  photos  are  in Attachment  3. \nConclusion: \nBased  on  my  experience  and  my  understanding  of the  requirements,  it  is  my  opinion  that the  Florida \nPrisons  are  not  accessible  to  inmates  with  disabilities.  The  facilities  do  not  comply  with  Title  II  of \nthe  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  and  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973 \n(Section  504).  I  reserve  the  right to  amend  my  report  should  additional  information  become \navailable. \n1] \n  \nArchitecture  Consulting  Barrier-Free  Design \n4016  Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781  301-440-4276  301-263-6868  Fax  mark.j.mazz@verizon.net\nCase  4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS  Document  62-31  Filed  01/30/17  Pa  acer  TT \nAttachment  1 \n  \n  \nMark  J.

Since  then,  he  has  been responsible  for  the  accessibility projects  in  his \nprivate practice  and in  the  offices  of Edwin  F.  Ball,  AIA,  and  Celentano  Esposito  &  Associates.  Also, \nMr.  Mazz  has  collaborated with  other  nationally known  \"accessibility  firms”  including  Ron  Mace  and \nBarrier  Free  Environments.  His  clients  include  owners,  architects,  engineers,  developers,  construction \nmanagers,  organizations  for persons  with  disabilities,  and  governmental  agencies.  His  major  clients  have \nincluded the  Architect  of the  Capitol,  other  Federal  agencies,  and  Howard  County  Public  School  System. \nIn  his  eight years  with the  Federal  Government,  Mr.  Mazz  was  an  architect  in DOJ’s  Housing  and  Civil \nEnforcement  and Disability  Rights  Sections  and the  senior  advisor  on  accessibility  issues  in HUD’s \nOffice  of Fair  Housing  and Equal  Opportunity. \nMore  than  70%  of his  career  has  focused  on  accessibility.  For  the  past  16  years,  Mr.  Mazz  has  focused \nexclusively  on  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  the  Fair  Housing  Amendments  Act  (FHA), \nSection  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act  (Section  504),  the  Architectural  Barriers  Act  (ABA),  and  accessible \ndesign  issues.  Prior  to  federal  employment,  he  belonged  to  several  disability  organizations  and  donated \nservices  through  the  Spinal  Cord  Injury  Network of Metropolitan Washington  and  Independence  Now, \nInc.  He  continues  to  donate  services  through  the  Maryland  Disability  Law  Center.

Standards for Medical Diagnostic Equipment, Federal Register Vol. 82, No. 5 Monday, January \n5, 2017, pages 2810 - 2848 \n \n \nMethodology for Applying the Accessibility Standards: \n \nI have 30-plus years’ experience as an architect and as an architectural accessibility consultant.  My \nwork includes reviews of correctional facilities in about 10 states, as well as other Section 504 and \nADA Title II barriers assessment and transition plans.  Also, I was employed for three years as an \narchitect in the Disabilities Rights Section of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.  In this practice, I have \nassessed facilities’ compliance with the standards and for providing “program access” (that is, \naccess to services, programs, and activities).  In my experience, in order to comply with the \nprogram access requirements of Section 504 and the ADA, a public entity must provide access to \nservices, programs, and activities (program access) in spaces that comply with applicable standards. \n \nI developed my opinion about whether the Florida Prisons are accessible to inmates with disabilities \nby using the accessibility standards referenced by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).   \n \nIn my experience, the DOJ Section 504 regulations require new construction, additions, or \nalterations constructed after March 7, 1988 to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS).   \n \n28 C.F.R. § 42.522 New construction.  \n(a) Design and construction. Each new facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall \nbe designed and constructed in such a manner that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by \nhandicapped persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this subpart. Any \nalterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made in an accessible manner. \n(b) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) Effective as of March 7, 1988, design, \nconstruction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3–8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101–19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements \nof this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements \nof UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and \nusability of the building is provided. \n \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II regulations require new construction, additions, \nor alterations constructed on or after January 26, 1992 and before March 15, 2012 to comply with \neither UFAS, the 1991 ADA Standards, or the 2010 ADA Standards.  Where a space or element is \nnot expressly addressed in the 1991 ADA Standards, the space or element must comply with the \n2010 ADA Standards.  New construction, additions, or alterations constructed on or after March 15, \n2012 must comply with the 2010 ADA Standards.   \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.151 New construction and alterations \n(a) Design and construction. \n(1) Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be \ndesigned and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and \nusable by individuals with disabilities, if the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992. \n(2) Exception for structural impracticability. \n3\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 4 of 130\n \n(i) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where a public entity can demonstrate \nthat it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements.  Full compliance will be considered structurally \nimpracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the \nincorporation of accessibility features. \n(ii) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is \nrequired to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be \nmade accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. \n(iii) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., \nthose who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to \npersons with other types of disabilities, (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental \nimpairments) in accordance with this section. \n(b) Alterations. \n(1) Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that \naffects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, \nbe altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities, if the alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992. \n. . .  \n(c) Accessibility standards and compliance date. \n(1) If physical construction or alterations commence after July 26, 1992, but prior to the September 15, 2010, \nthen new construction and alterations subject to this section must comply with either the UFAS or the 1991 \nStandards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 \nStandards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other \nmethods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility \nis thereby provided. \n(2) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, \n2012, then new construction and alterations subject to this section may comply with one of the following: the \n2010 Standards, UFAS, or the 1991 Standards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) \nand section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 Standards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either \nstandard by the use of other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the \nfacility or part of the facility is thereby provided. \n(3) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after March 15, 2012, then new construction and \nalterations subject to this section shall comply with the 2010 Standards. \n(4) For the purposes of this section, ceremonial groundbreaking or razing of structures prior to site preparation \ndo not commence physical construction or alterations. \n(5) Noncomplying new construction and alterations. \n(i) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that were constructed or \naltered before March 15, 2012, and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall before \nMarch 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with either the 1991 Standards, UFAS, or the 2010 \nStandards. \n(ii) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that are constructed or \naltered on or after March 15, 2012, and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall, on or \nafter March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards. \n \nSince September 15, 2010, the ADA Title II regulations require accessible cells to comply with the \n2010 ADA Standards. \n \n28 C.F.R. §35.151(k) Detention and correctional facilities. \n(1) New construction of jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities shall comply with the \n2010 Standards except that public entities shall provide accessible mobility features complying with section \n807.2 of the 2010 Standards for a minimum of 3%, but no fewer than one, of the total number of cells in a \nfacility. Cells with mobility features shall be provided in each classification level. \n(2) Alterations to detention and correctional facilities. Alterations to jails, prisons, and other detention and \ncorrectional facilities shall comply with the 2010 Standards except that public entities shall provide accessible \nmobility features complying with section 807.2 of the 2010 Standards for a minimum of 3%, but no fewer than \n4\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 5 of 130\n \none, of the total number of cells being altered until at least 3%, but no fewer than one, of the total number of \ncells in a facility shall provide mobility features complying with section 807.2. Altered cells with mobility \nfeatures shall be provided in each classification level. However, when alterations are made to specific cells, \ndetention and correctional facility operators may satisfy their obligation to provide the required number of cells \nwith mobility features by providing the required mobility features in substitute cells (cells other than those \nwhere alterations are originally planned), provided that each substitute cell— \n(i) Is located within the same prison site; \n(ii) Is integrated with other cells to the maximum extent feasible; \n(iii) Has, at a minimum, equal physical access as the altered cells to areas used by inmates or detainees for \nvisitation, dining, recreation, educational programs, medical services, work programs, religious services, and \nparticipation in other programs that the facility offers to inmates or detainees; and, \n(iv) If it is technically infeasible to locate a substitute cell within the same prison site, a substitute cell must be \nprovided at another prison site within the corrections system. \n(3) With respect to medical and long-term care facilities in jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional \nfacilities, public entities shall apply the 2010 Standards technical and scoping requirements for those facilities \nirrespective of whether those facilities are licensed. \n \n§ 35.152 Jails, detention and correctional facilities, and community correctional facilities. \n(a) General. This section applies to public entities that are responsible for the operation or management of adult \nand juvenile justice jails, detention and correctional facilities, and community correctional facilities, either \ndirectly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements with public or private entities, in whole or in \npart, including private correctional facilities. \n(b) Discrimination prohibited. \n(1) Public entities shall ensure that qualified inmates or detainees with disabilities shall not, because a facility \nis inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied \nthe benefits of, the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \npublic entity. \n(2) Public entities shall ensure that inmates or detainees with disabilities are housed in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of the individuals. Unless it is appropriate to make an exception, a public \nentity– \n(i) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in inappropriate security classifications because no \naccessible cells or beds are available; \n(ii) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in designated medical areas unless they are actually \nreceiving medical care or treatment; \n(iii) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in facilities that do not offer the same programs as the \nfacilities where they would otherwise be housed; and \n(iv) Shall not deprive inmates or detainees with disabilities of visitation with family members by placing them \nin distant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed. \n(3) Public entities shall implement reasonable policies, including physical modifications to additional cells in \naccordance with the 2010 Standards, so as to ensure that each inmate with a disability is housed in a cell with \nthe accessible elements necessary to afford the inmate access to safe, appropriate housing. \n \nAlso, portions of facilities that have not been altered since March 7, 1988 must comply with Section \n504 §42.521. \n \n28 C.F.R. § 42.521 Existing facilities.  \n(a) Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this subpart applies so that when \neach part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This section \ndoes not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and \nusable by handicapped persons.  \n(b) Compliance procedures. A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section \nthrough acquisition or redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of \naids to beneficiaries, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities, or any \n5\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 6 of 130\n \nother method that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is \nnot required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving \ncompliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among methods for meeting the requirement of \nparagraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate. \n \nPortions of facilities that have not been altered since January 26, 1992 must comply with ADA \n§35.150(a) and §35.152.   \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.150 Existing facilities \n(a) General. A public entity shall operate each service, program, or activity so that the service, program, or \nactivity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This \nparagraph does not— \n(1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities; \n(2) Require a public entity to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an \nhistoric property; or \n(3) Require a public entity to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in \nthe nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those \ncircumstances where personnel of the public entity believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter \nthe service, program, or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, a public entity \nhas the burden of proving that compliance with §35.150(a) of this part would result in such alteration or \nburdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the head of \na public entity or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and \noperation of the service, program, or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons \nfor reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, a public entity \nshall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless \nensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by the public entity. \nb) Methods. \n(1) General. A public entity may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign \nor acquisition of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to \nbeneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and \nconstruction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock or other conveyances, or any other methods that \nresult in making its services, programs, or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \ndisabilities. A public entity is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods \nare effective in achieving compliance with this section. A public entity, in making alterations to existing \nbuildings, shall meet the accessibility requirements of § 35.151. In choosing among available methods for \nmeeting the requirements of this section, a public entity shall give priority to those methods that offer services, \nprograms, and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate. \n \nThese sections require a public entity to operate each service, program, or activity so that the \nservice, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities.  Services, programs, and activities (i.e. program access) include \nhousing in different levels of confinement, such as minimum security, medium security, and \nmaximum security.  It also includes access to recreational facilities, classrooms, libraries, \ncomputers, work programs, visitation areas, mailrooms, commissaries, and other areas.  Facilities \ndesignated for accessible services, programs, and activities must comply with alterations provisions \nof UFAS, the 1991 ADA Standards, or the 2010 ADA Standards (35.150(b)).

Structural changes in existing facilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to \nmake the public entity's program accessible. (It should be noted that \"structural changes\" include all physical \nchanges to a facility; the term does not refer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or \nalteration to a loadbearing structural member.) The requirements of §35.151 for alterations apply to structural \nchanges undertaken to comply with this section. The public entity may comply with the program accessibility \nrequirement by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits as appropriate. \n \n \nWhere inmates use facilities independently, program access requires that inmates with disabilities, \nto the extent feasible, also be permitted to use these facilities independently.  Therefore, physical \nbarriers that block independent access must be removed.  Here are some examples.  There must be \nsufficient clear floor space around the toilet to facilitate an independent transfer.  The shower must \nbe on an accessible route, have sufficient clear floor space, have accessible controls and grab bars, \nand provide the same level of privacy.  And, recreational equipment must be on an accessible route.  \n \nUFAS Section 4.1.4(9)(b) requires 5% of the residential units and all common use areas be made \naccessible.  The ADA requires each detention and correctional facility to provide accessible \nmobility features in at least 3% of its cells (§ 35.151(k)(1)).  The accessible cells must be distributed \namong the types of cells. \n \nAccessible housing cells must be in the most integrated setting that is appropriate to the needs of the \ninmate.  Section 35.152(b)(2) uses the following criteria: \n \n“(i) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in inappropriate security classifications because no \naccessible cells or beds are available; \n(ii) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in designated medical areas unless they are actually \nreceiving medical care or treatment; \n(iii) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in facilities that do not offer the same programs as the \nfacilities where they would otherwise be housed; and  \n(iv) Shall not deprive inmates or detainees with disabilities of visitation with family members by placing them \nin distant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed.” \n \n \nProgram Access: \n \nTo review for program access, one must know all the services, programs, and activities provided by \nFDC.  Program access is not limited to each of the custody, medical, and psychological grades.  It \nalso includes access to all the academic, vocational, substance abuse, community, religious, \nbetterment, recreation, P.R.I.D.E., and work programs to the degree that it would not fundamentally \nalter the program.  For example, vocational training might not include farm work, but it could \ninclude a commercial driver’s license, cooking, or being a technical support specialist.  It also \nincludes all methods for achieving gaintime.  It includes canine programs. \n \nDuring my surveys, I was told repeatedly that inmates in wheelchairs were not allowed to work in \nthe kitchens, libraries, and canteens.  Those areas were not surveyed.  There appears to be no \nmeaningful work opportunities if an inmate used a wheelchair.   \n \nI plan to address the physical access to programs in a supplemental report. \n7\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 8 of 130\n \n \n  \nMedical Equipment: \n \nMedical equipment must be accessible to provide program access.  (35.150(a) and (b) and Federal \nRegister Vol. 75, No. 178, September 15, 2010, page 56235). I saw no lifts or adjustable height \nexam tables.  Although other facilities had scales, the only scale for an inmate in a wheelchair is in \nthe Reception and Medical Center (RMC).  Although there are medical facilities at each location \nthat I surveyed, none except the RMC appear to address any accessibility issues.   \n \nI plan to address access to medical facilities and equipment in a supplemental report. \n \n \nDeviations from the Standards: \n \nIn my experience, Section 504 and the ADA permit deviating from the Standards when compliance \nwith the Standards is structurally impracticable or technically infeasible.   The ADA defines \nstructurally impracticable is applied rarely when unique characteristics of terrain prevent the \nincorporation of accessible features: \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.151 New construction and alterations \n(2) Exception for structural impracticability. \n(i) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where a public entity can demonstrate \nthat it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements.  Full compliance will be considered structurally \nimpracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the \nincorporation of accessibility features. \n \nThe correctional facilities are on a large, mostly flat land.  The few older facilities with gentle \nslopes have sufficient space to provide ramps.  None of the facilities were raised significantly above \nthe natural grade. The terrain does not prevent the incorporation of accessible features.  Therefore, \nnone of my findings are structurally impracticable to modify to make accessible. \n \nThe ADA Standards define technically infeasible as:  \n \nTechnically Infeasible. With respect to an alteration of a building or a facility, something that has little \nlikelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a \nload-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing physical or site \nconstraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict \ncompliance with the minimum requirements. \n \nIf something is technically infeasible, the ADA Standards still requires accessibility to the \nmaximum extent feasible: \n \n202.3 Alterations. Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space shall comply \nwith the applicable requirements of Chapter 2. \nEXCEPTIONS: 1. Unless required by 202.4, where elements or spaces are altered and the circulation path to \nthe altered element or space is not altered, an accessible route shall not be required. \n8\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 9 of 130\n \n2. In alterations, where compliance with applicable requirements is technically infeasible, the alteration shall \ncomply with the requirements to the maximum extent feasible. \n \nFor example, if a designated accessible housing cell cannot be widened to accommodate 60”-\ndiameter turning space, the window controls and the toilet facilities must still be modified to \ncomply. \n \nI did not report in my findings barriers whose only remedy would require removing or altering load-\nbearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame.  Therefore, none of my findings are \ntechnically infeasible to modify to make accessible.  \n \n \nStandards used During Survey: \n \nThese facilities were built before July 26, 1992.  I could not determine which parts may have been \nbuilt or altered after March 7, 1988.  Therefore, I could not determine where the UFAS new \nconstruction requirements would apply.  Except to the number of accessible cells that are required, \nUFAS has substantially the same requirements as 1991 ADA Standards.  In that I only looked at \nparts used by inmates with disabilities, I used the 1991 ADA Standards.  I used the 2010 ADA \nStandards where supplemental scoping or technical requirements for detention facilities are \nprovided: \n1.  Lowell Correctional Institution \n2.  South Florida Reception Center \n \nParts of this facility was built before July 26, 1992.  I could not determine which parts may have \nbeen built or altered between March 7, 1988 and July 26,1992.  Therefore, I could not determine \nwhere the UFAS new construction requirements would apply.  Significant parts appear to have been \naltered after July 26, 1992.  In that I only looked at parts used by inmates with disabilities, I used \nthe 1991 ADA Standards.  I used the 2010 ADA Standards where supplemental scoping or technical \nrequirements for detention facilities are provided: \n3.  Reception and Medical Center \n \nConstruction for these facilities were started after July 26, 1992 but before March 15, 2012.  I used \nthe 1991 ADA Standards.

For example, the \nseven facilities built after July 26, 1992 and any alterations made in the other three facilities after \nJuly 26, 1992 must comply with the ADA Standards.  Any areas not used by inmates with \ndisabilities were not surveyed.  Additionally, areas that may be required by program access but were \nnot available to inmates with disabilities were not surveyed.  For example, areas where inmates \nwork and areas used by visitors with disabilities were not surveyed. \n \nI surveyed a sampling of repetitive spaces.  For example, where all the classrooms appeared to be \nthe same I surveyed only one.  I surveyed representative samples of the housing cells and dorms \nused by inmates with disabilities regardless of custody grades or confinement or punitive status.  \nTherefore, where a report a barrier in a particular space, that barrier may occur several times in \nseveral similar spaces. \n \nFacilities reviewed are: \n \n1.  Male: \na.  Region 2: \ni.  Baker Re-Entry Center \n1.  Common use areas for inmates \n2.  C-Dorm \nii.  Mayo Correctional Institution Annex \n1.  Common use areas for inmates \n2.

I-Dorm  \niii.  Lowell Correctional Institution Annex \n1.  Common use areas for inmates \n2.  N-Dorm, T-Dorm \n \nUsing the ADA Standards, I measured the areas listed above including the route to these areas and \nall ancillary spaces and features that inmates use such as toilet rooms and drinking fountains.  \nWhere possible, I took several photos of each barrier to show the context of the barrier and the \nactual measurement.  Barriers that I found in the September and October site surveys are listed in \nthe chart in Attachment 2.  In that I surveyed a sampling of repetitive spaces, not all barriers are \nlisted in the chart.   \n \nI plan to address the barriers found in the January site visits in a supplemental report.  In the \nWakulla Correctional Institution and Annex, I had the opportunity to survey parts of the facilities \nthat are not used by inmates with disabilities but were constructed after January 26, 1992.  I also \nplan to address these barriers in a supplemental report.  \n \n \nThe charts have four or five columns.  “Citation for Remediation” provides the 2010 ADA \nStandards citation for remediation, since remediation will occur after the effective date of March 15, \n2012.  For facilities where construction started after March 15, 2012, it is also the non-compliance \ncitation.  “Citation for Non-Compliance” provides the ADA Standards citation non-compliance.  \n“Description/Issue/Requirement” states the requirement.  “Barriers” identifies how it does not \ncomply.  And, “Photos” references the photos that show the location and non-complying \nmeasurement.  The photos are in Attachment 3. \n \n \nConclusion: \n \nBased on my experience and my understanding of the requirements, it is my opinion that the Florida \nPrisons are not accessible to inmates with disabilities.  The facilities do not comply with Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n(Section 504).  I reserve the right to amend my report should additional information become \navailable. \n \n \n \n \n11\nArchitecture                Consulting               Barrier-Free Design \n4016 Jefferson Street, Hyattsville, MD 20781      301-440-4276           301-263-6868 Fax                    mark.j.mazz@verizon.net \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-31   Filed 01/30/17   Page 12 of 130\n  Mark J.

EXPERT QUALIFICATIONS \nI am currently a tenured Professor of American Sign Language (“ASL”) and Modern \nLanguages at Northeastern University. I am the Director of the American Sign Language Program, \nformer Director of the World Languages Center and the former Chair of the Department of \nLanguages, Literatures and Cultures. I have been involved with Deaf people on a personal and \nprofessional level for 48 years. I hold a Masters in Applied Linguistics from American University \nand a Doctorate in Sociolinguistics from Georgetown University. I am a nationally certified Sign \nLanguage interpreter and have served two terms as President of the Registry of Interpreters for the \nDeaf (“RID”), the professional organization of and the national certifying body for interpreters. I \nhave authored or coauthored 10 textbooks, five book chapters, and 35 articles or conference \nproceedings, and have directed and/or edited over 350 videotapes focusing on American Sign \nLanguage and ASL/English Interpretation. I also have produced published translations of over 80 \nvideotapes. The 1980 series of five texts that I co-authored is still widely used in Sign Language \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 3 of 92\n   \nprograms and classes across the United States. My 1992 book, A Sociolinguistic Model of the \nInterpretation Process, is widely used in Interpreter Education Programs and has been translated \ninto Italian and German and significant portions have been translated into Swedish and Japanese. \nI am currently the Principal Investigator for a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of \nEducation to establish a National Interpreter Education Center at Northeastern University. \nPrior to coming to Northeastern, I spent 12 years working full-time as the President and \nco-owner of Sign Media, Inc., a video-production company specializing in producing print and \nvideo material focused on the American Deaf Community (“Deaf Community” or “Community”), \nAmerican Sign Language, and ASL/English Interpretation. Prior to that I spent 13 years working \nat Gallaudet University1 in a number of capacities: a teacher of elementary, undergraduate and \ngraduate students; an administrator responsible for teaching and evaluating faculty and staff; and \na Research Associate in the Linguistics Research Lab researching ASL/English interpretation. \nAttached as Appendix A is my complete curriculum vitae, which also includes a listing of the other \ninstances in which I have served as an expert witness. During the last four-years I have not testified \nat trial and was deposed once on December 9, 2016 in McBride, et al vs. the Michigan Department \nof Corrections, Case No. C.A. 2:15-CV-11222) (E.D.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \nMembers of the American Deaf Community are a linguistic and cultural minority. The \nlanguage that binds them together and is the critical determinant for membership in the Community \nis American Sign Language. The vast majority of people who are not deaf have stereotypic \nmisconceptions about d/Deaf 2 people and American Sign Language. They often believe that \nd/Deaf people can lip-read with a degree of accuracy that will enable meaningful communication, \nwhen in reality the level of lip-reading accuracy for most d/Deaf and hard of hearing people is \n30% at best. Those who are not deaf often believe that d/Deaf people can read and write in fluent \nEnglish when, in reality, the average Deaf person reads at approximately a fourth grade reading \nlevel. Those who are not d/Deaf often fail to understand that effective communication with d/Deaf \npeople requires that one communicate visually, such as by using visual signals and alarms and \nprovision of sign language interpreters when needed. These erroneous, stereotypic beliefs about \nand attitudes toward d/Deaf people frequently result in systematic discrimination against d/Deaf \npeople. Such discrimination, known as audism, occurs when those who are not d/Deaf assume that \nd/Deaf  people  are  inferior  because  of  their  different  hearing  status  and  when  access  to \n                                                 \n2 The significance of the distinction between lower case and upper case D in the word d/Deaf is explained \nbelow. \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 5 of 92\n   \nenvironments, technology, institutions and programs is predicated upon one’s ability to hear. \nSimply put, the failure to provide visual access to aspects of society that are only auditorily \naccessible is audism. \nBased on my experience of over 48 years, my visits to FDOC facilities between August 18 \nand 23, 2016 and meetings with 30 d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates at those facilities, and my \nreview of written documentation, I believe that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections (FDOC) have been denied effective communication and access to the \nservices and technology that make effective communication possible. I believe that FDOC has \nrestricted access to services, programs and communication in a way that denies meaningful and \neffective communicative access for FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. I further believe \nthat the policies and procedures put in place unfairly and unnecessarily treat d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing FDOC inmates differently than non-deaf inmates and deny them access to services, \nprograms and benefits that are afforded to non-deaf inmates. I also believe that the issues I \nobserved at the ten FDOC facilities, the policies and procedures I have reviewed in documents \nprovided to me, and the treatment of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates revealed during my \ninterviews makes it clear to me that these issues are system-wide and not just restricted to 10 \nfacilities. In sum, I believe that FDOC engages in audist behaviors.  \nTo ensure effective communication, as well as the physical safety of d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates, FDOC must, minimally, undertake the following major steps.   \nA.  In order to enable d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to communicate effectively \nwith others at FDOC facilities, FDOC must reliably provide d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates with qualified sign language interpreters.  \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 6 of 92\n   \nB.  In order to enable d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to communicate effectively \nwith others outside of FDOC facilities, FDOC must provide d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates with access to a videophone and, if functionally appropriate, a TTY \nand/or a CapTel phone.  \nC.  In order to ensure that FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are notified of \nalarms or institutional emergencies at FDOC facilities, FDOC must at least install \nflashing light boards inside each d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate’s cell or install \nlights that are clearly visible from inside each d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate’s \ncell.  \nD.  FDOC must provide large screen televisions so that captions are accessible to \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates and it must provide TV transmitters and \nreceivers for those d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who can benefit from them. \nFDOC must also have policies in place that ensure captions are available to d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates at all time television access is available to inmates who \nare not d/Deaf or hard of hearing. \nE.  FDOC must review all of its policies and procedures to ensure that d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates are not systematically disadvantaged relative to inmates who are \nnot d/Deaf or hard of hearing.  \n \nE.  FDOC should require mandatory regular training/orientation sessions for all FDOC \npersonnel who are responsible for or have the need to interact with d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates.. \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 7 of 92\n   \nF.  FDOC should consider consolidating d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates at 3-5 \nFDOC facilities located near major urban areas which would result in significant \ncost savings by achieving economy of scale in providing communicative access to \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. These facilities should be geographically \ndispersed statewide so the d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates can be as near as \npossible to family and friends to maintain family support and to ensure a better \ntransition to society when released. \nG.  FDOC should also re-examine its policy of only providing one hearing aid to hard \nof hearing inmates and should require an expedited timely repair of hearing aids. \nThis would be more possible by contracting repair services with businesses located \nnear facilities housing d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \nFinally, as additional information becomes available, I expect to examine that material and \nexpand upon the opinions offered in this report.  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Defining Deafness \nAlthough it is often the case that those seeking to define or discuss deafness do so from a \nmedical or audiological perspective, such a singular perspective significantly misses the mark. The \nmeaning of deafness is best understood “when it is viewed as a social phenomenon rather than as \na physical disability. To say this is not to deny the usefulness of studying deafness medically but \nrather to point out that such an approach tends to overlook how their deafness influences deaf \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 8 of 92\n   \npeoples’ daily lives, how the disability of deafness becomes a handicap.” (Schein, 1996).3  Schein \ngoes on to define deafness as “the common outcome of diverse causes resulting in an inability to \nhear and understand speech through the ear alone.” The critical import of this definition is that it \nemphasizes communication – a quintessential function of human beings. This definition specifies \nthat people who are deaf cannot hear and cannot understand speech; they may be able to hear \nspeech but cannot understand it (i.e. cannot discriminate what is said). Even if they can hear loud \nnoises and are aware that someone is talking, they are still deaf by this definition if they cannot \nunderstand the speech they hear. This functional definition then clearly and helpfully distinguishes \nthe difference between those who are hard of hearing (those who have reduced hearing ability but \ncan hear and understand speech) and those who are deaf (those who cannot hear and cannot \nunderstand speech).  \nThe  age  at  which  one  becomes  deaf  is  critically  important  because  this  determines \nmembership in one of two subsets within the larger class of deaf individuals. Childhood deafness \ncreates significant obstacles to acquiring spoken language and becoming literate in English, and is \ngenerally associated with a tendency to seek out and socialize with other deaf people, thus \nbecoming part of the American Deaf Community. Adult onset deafness, on the other hand, \ngenerally does not interfere with speech and those who become deaf as adults generally do not \nseek  out  members  of  the  American  Deaf  Community  (i.e.  those  early  deafened)  for \ncompanionship, nor do members of the American Deaf Community seek out late-deafened adults \nfor companionship. This is because, although members of each subset are deaf (i.e. they cannot \n                                                 \n3 All secondary sources referenced in my report are listed in their entirety in the “References” section of \nmy report, listed at pg. A B. \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 9 of 92\n   \nhear and cannot understand speech), and although members of each subset rely upon visual not \nauditory means of communication, their life experiences have had different trajectories. \nSummary Of Opinions With Respect To Defining Deafness: \n•  The  meaning  of  deafness  is  best  understood  when  viewed  as  a  social  and \ncommunicative phenomenon rather than simply as a physical disability. \n•  The class of people who are deaf cannot hear and cannot understand speech. \n•  Within the class of people who are deaf, there are two subsets: those who are deaf from \nchildhood and those who become late-deafened. \n•  Although  each  subset  is  deaf  and  relies  upon  visual  communication,  their  life \nexperiences have been very different. \nB.  The American Deaf Community: A Linguistic And Cultural Minority \nThere is an identifiable subset of deaf people in America that is unable to rely upon hearing \nand speech as an effective and primary means of relating to the world and interacting with those \nwho are not deaf. As children, some of these individuals, by virtue of parental decision or \neducational placement, are placed on a trajectory where they will spend their lives pursuing the \ngoal of assimilating with the hearing and speaking majority of the population (i.e. trying to “pass”) \nto the extent possible. Others, however, are placed on a very different trajectory because they have \nbeen given or choose to embrace a different “center” for their lives – a Deaf center. These deaf \nindividuals see themselves as Deaf. The written distinction between “deaf” and “Deaf,” lower and \nupper case, has been used since 1972 to differentiate between those who are deaf and those who \nare deaf but who also identify as a member of a linguistic and cultural minority (Woodward, 1972).  \nIndividuals who are Deaf use American Sign Language and are fundamentally a visual \npeople, with their own visual language, social organizations, history,  and mores.  They see \nthemselves as members of the Deaf-World. Indeed, a case has been made that members of the \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 10 of 92\n   \nDeaf-World should be viewed as an ethnic group rather than a “disabled” group (Lane, Pillard & \nHedberg, 2011). Contrary to the view held by most non-deaf people, Deaf people do not view their \naudiological condition as the primary reality that binds them together as a Community. Although \nsociety in general may view their audiological condition as a defining element for Deaf people, \nwhat binds Deaf people together is their use of American Sign Language. Deaf people are a \nlinguistic and cultural minority that has been, and continues to be, communicatively disadvantaged \nby the hearing and speaking majority (e.g. Padden and Humphries 2005; Lane 1992; Jankowski, \n1997; Wrigley, 1996). In short, these individuals, united by their use of American Sign Language, \nare members of the American Deaf Community.  \nThe use of American Sign Language not only unites Deaf people but it also defines them \nas a linguistic minority. The primary reason for the central role of American Sign Language is that, \nunlike any other means of communication available to Deaf people, American Sign Language is \nthe only means of communication that enables effective, efficient and reliable communication. \nWhile some late-deafened adults do try to learn to sign, they often do so to compensate for \nthe deteriorating intelligibility of their speech, to communicate with family members or friends \nwho are learning to sign or perhaps to communicate with Deaf people they have met. However, \nlearning to sign does not automatically mean that they wish to identify themselves as Deaf; late-\ndeafened adults usually continue to identify themselves as deaf – unable to hear, sharing an \naudiological condition and the need for visual means of communication with Deaf people – but \nthey do not see themselves as having a linguistic and cultural identity as a member of the Deaf \nCommunity.   \nSummary Of Opinions With Respect To The American Deaf Community: \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 11 of 92\n   \n•  Deaf people are unable to rely upon their hearing and speech as an effective and \nprimary means of relating to the world and interacting with the majority. \n•  Members of the American Deaf Community have their own visual language: American \nSign Language. \n•  Deaf  people  are  a  linguistic  and  cultural  minority  that  is  communicatively \ndisadvantaged by the hearing and speaking majority. \n•  American Sign Language is central to determining membership in and defining the \nAmerican Deaf Community. \n•  American Sign Language is the only means of communication that enables effective, \nefficient and reliable communication for members of the American Deaf Community. \nC.  Deaf People As A Linguistic Community  \nAlthough the existence of an American Deaf Community is now undeniable, most people \nwith little or no knowledge of or experience with d/Deaf people make a number of stereotypic and \nunfounded assumptions about d/Deaf people (Cokely, 2001; Spingarn, 2001). For example, they \nwrongly assume that “all deaf people can lip-read” or that “all deaf people can speak” or that “all \ndeaf people are fully literate in English.” While these are uninformed and naïve views of d/Deaf \npeople, the long-standing and well-documented reality is that members of the American Deaf \nCommunity, as a group, do not use their speech for communication, do not lip-read English well \nand, as a group, have extremely limited competence in English. \nHowever, as noted above, the most significant factor uniting and identifying members of \nthe American Deaf Community is not whether a Deaf person uses speech, the degree of hearing \npossessed by a Deaf person, or competence in English. Rather, it is whether a person uses \nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) as his/her primary means of communication. The use of American \nSign Language provides a means of determining acceptance into the Community, enables social \ninteraction among members of the Community, and, through the use of ASL/English interpreters, \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 12 of 92\n   \nprovides a ready means of interacting with non-deaf people. The importance of American Sign \nLanguage derives from the fact that it is a visually clear and accessible means of communication \nthat enables Deaf people to have effective and efficient communication with each other and, by \nemploying the services of an ASL/English interpreter, with the hearing and speaking majority. \nBecause of the essential nature of American Sign Language in defining the American Deaf \nCommunity as a linguistic minority, it is important to address and dispel several misconceptions \nabout ASL. \n1.  American Sign Language  \nA primary misconception often held by those unfamiliar with American Sign Language is \nthat they assume it is simply a manual form of, or a derivative form of, spoken English. They \nassume wrongly. The lexicon (i.e. the vocabulary) of a signed language refers, not to the words of \na spoken language, but rather directly to the concept or meaning that Deaf people wish to convey \n(Baker-Shenk & Cokely, 1980; Valli, Lucas & Mulrooney, 2005). In American Sign Language, \nsigns refer not to English words, but rather to the concepts or meanings that its users wish to convey \nand exchange. For example, the American Sign Language sign refers to an object (e.g. a cat) and \nnot to the English word for that object (just as the Japanese word “neko” refers, not to the English \nword “cat” but to the cat itself). American Sign Language has a lexicon and syntactic structure \nquite unlike that of spoken English. In simplest terms, there is not a one-to-one correspondence \nbetween American English words and the signs in American Sign Language, as is true of any two \nlanguages, spoken or signed. Instead, American Sign Language is a naturally evolved language \nused by members of the American Deaf Community and those non-Deaf people who have learned \nor acquired it. The linguistic evidence is clear and incontrovertible - American Sign Language is \nstructurally different from English. (Stokoe, 1965)  \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 13 of 92\n   \nAnother way in which ASL differs from English is that it does not have a conventionally \naccepted written form, i.e. an orthography. This is true of all of the signed languages and many of \nthe spoken languages in the world. There have been several attempts at creating a notation system \nfor recording signed languages, the most notable of which is Stokoe notation system (Stokoe, et al \n1965). However, like the  International Phonetic Alphabet that is used to transcribe spoken \nlanguages, the use of Stokoe notation system has largely been restricted to linguists and is now \nbeing replaced by digital video recordings and computer programs that are being used to record \nand  analyze  signed  languages  (e.g.  Boston  University’s  SignStream \nhttp://www.bu.edu/asllrp/SignStream/  and  SportsTec’s  StudioCode  application \nhttp://www.sportstecinternational.com/). A more widely used means of trying to record signs is \n“glossing” (e.g. Baker-Shenk & Cokely, 1980), in which an English word written in all capital \nletters is used to refer to a sign. Thus the gloss “CAT” refers to the sign that is used to represent \nthe concept “cat”. Glossing has some severe limitations however. Unlike Stokoe notation, the \nreader of a glossed transcription must already know the sign being referred to in order to \napproximate the articulation of the sign that was glossed. Also the same gloss may refer to two \ndifferent variants of the same sign, since glossing does not capture articulatory behaviors. Despite \nthese limitations, it is not uncommon for Deaf people to use glosses when writing notes or when \ncommunicating with a TeleType Writer (the acronym TTY is used). TTYs began as retrofitted, \ndiscarded Western Union teletype machines, hence the acronym TTY.  Newer devices are also \nreferred to by the acronym TDD - Telecommunication Device for the Deaf.  TTYs/TDDs make it \npossible for Deaf people to type to each other over existing phone lines; but TTYs/TDDs are now \nvirtually obsolete because of the virtually ubiquitous presence of Videophones within the Deaf \nCommunity. \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 14 of 92\n   \nHowever, glossing is not a written form of American Sign Language, nor is it written \nEnglish,  even  though  the  words  may  be  English  words.  It  is  practically  and  linguistically \ninconceivable  that  a  written  two-dimensional  form  could  reliably  and  easily  capture  three-\ndimensional moving, signed, conversational interactions. Analog and digital video recordings and \nthe use of Videophones (essentially internet signed communication using video web-cams) not \nonly have rapidly replaced TTYs and the need for a written form of American Sign Language, but \nalso have provided a more accurate means of preserving and sharing signed interactions.  \nDeaf people as a group are unable to rely upon their hearing and speech as an effective and \nprimary  means  of  communication.  Likewise,  they  also  are  unable  to  rely  upon  means  of \ncommunication that are based on or derived from speech and hearing, such as written English, as \nan effective and primary means of communication. For Deaf people, the use of American Sign \nLanguage is not simply a matter of convenience or preference. American Sign Language provides \nthe only effective and efficient means of linguistic communication for members of the Deaf \nCommunity.  \n2.  Limitations Of English Within The American Deaf Community  \nIt is clear and undeniable that members of the American Deaf Community embrace and \naccept American Sign Language, and that its use is central to defining and understanding the Deaf \nCommunity. It is also clear that Deaf people exist as a linguistic minority within a society in which \nEnglish is the dominant language. However, there are significant challenges that Deaf people, as \na group, face in becoming fluent in English. Some of these challenges are the same as those for \nany  second  language  learner,  but  other,  more  severe  challenges  exist  for  Deaf  people. \nNevertheless, one of the widely held misconceptions about Deaf people is that although they do \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 15 of 92\n   \nsign, they can read and write English fluently. As with other misconceptions about Deaf people, \nthis has no basis in fact or reality. \nWhile it certainly is a desirable goal for Deaf individuals to be competent in both ASL and \nEnglish, the reality is that for the vast majority of Deaf people, competence in English is rarely \nattained. Certainly the history of the education of Deaf students attests to the fact that, for the vast \nmajority of Deaf people, acquiring competence in spoken English is virtually unattainable (among \nothers, Marschark & Spencer, 2003; Wrigley, 1996; Lane, 1992). Also, the majority of Deaf people \ndo not attain competence in reading and writing English because those forms of communication \nare derived from spoken English. According to Karchmer and Mitchell (2003), study after study \nconcludes with the same overriding concern: “…the average performance on tests of reading \ncomprehension for deaf and hard of hearing students is roughly six grade equivalents lower than \ntheir hearing peers at age 15.” (e.g. Allen, 1986; Traxler, 2000). The essential difficulty is that \nDeaf students are “…caught in a vicious circle: their impoverished vocabularies limit their reading \ncomprehension and poor reading strategies and skills limit their ability to acquire adequate \nvocabulary knowledge from context.” (deVillers and Pomerantz 1992). Thus, the commonly held \nmisconception that Deaf people as a group can read and write English fluently is easily dismissed. \nThe evidence is overwhelmingly clear – Deaf people, as a group, are not competent users of \nEnglish.  \nCertainly, most Deaf people achieve what might be termed “survival” English. This means \nthat, as a group, Deaf people have a level of literacy that enables them to interact with much of the \nroutine written English language that they encounter in their daily lives. It is the repetitiveness, \npredictability and/or limited context within which this written English occurs that facilitates Deaf \npeople’s  comprehension.  For  example,  they  read  street  signs,  menus,  subway  directions, \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 16 of 92\n   \nadvertising posters and flyers and other basic printed material that is necessary or useful for them \nto live their lives on a daily basis. As a group, Deaf people might be described as marginal readers. \nThat is, Deaf people do subscribe to newspapers and magazines, although many seek out those \nportions of the publications supported by visual material (e.g. the comics page or advertising) or \ncontain familiar arrays of numbers (e.g. the sports page). However, one should not mistake this \nlevel of responding to basic English print in routine day-to-day tasks with a level of literacy \nsufficient to rely upon printed material to gain non-recurring or important information or to read \nmost books or magazines. \nDeaf  people  also  communicate  via  e-mail  and  TTY  conversations,  although  those \ncommunications often read like written (i.e. glossed) versions of what they would sign. Further, \nDeaf  people  write  notes  to  people  who  are  not  deaf,  although  their  notes  are  frequently \nmisunderstood. Just as in the non-deaf population as a whole, there is within the American Deaf \nCommunity a range of literacy.  However, the critical point is that the average literacy level of \nmembers of the American Deaf Community is significantly lower than it is for the population as a \nwhole.  \nAccording to the Gallaudet Research Institute, “For the 17-year-olds and the 18-year-olds \nin the deaf and hard of hearing student norming sample, the median Reading Comprehension \nsubtest score corresponds to about a 4.0 grade level for hearing students. That means that half of \nthe deaf and hard of hearing students at that age scored above the typical hearing student at the \nbeginning of fourth grade, and half scored below.” (http://gri.gallaudet.edu/Literacy/). Given this \nand given that literacy levels among the U.S. prison population are generally lower than those \namong the general population (Alaska Justice Forum 24(2): 2-4), one could reasonably conclude \nthat the literacy levels among Deaf inmates would be lower than the non-deaf inmate population. \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 17 of 92\n   \nIn fact, given that the generally accepted definition of functional illiteracy is a level of reading and \nwriting skills that is insufficient to manage tasks of daily living and employment that require a \nlevel of reading and writing beyond a basic level, one would expect that a greater proportion of \nDeaf inmates would be considered functionally illiterate than would be the case for the inmate \npopulation as a whole. \nThe difficulties that a limited level of literacy presents for Deaf people are clearly non-\ntrivial. Consider, for example, that when one personality test was given to Deaf people using \nelementary English and again using ASL, the results were so different that the investigators \nconcluded it was like giving two different tests. (Lane, 1992). This author goes on to describe the \ndifficulties in administering psychological tests to Deaf people: \nSince  Deaf  test  takers  in  America  frequently  are  not  fluent  in \nEnglish, they not only fail to understand test instructions thoroughly, \ninvalidating the results, but also fail to understand the test content \nitself, as most tests are presented in written English, and in rather \nhigh-level English at that.  \nOne authority estimates that a tenth grade knowledge of English is \nneeded to take most personality tests meaningfully. Yet only one \ndeaf student in ten reads at eighth-grade level or better, and the \naverage  deaf  student  on  leaving  school  has  only  a  third  grade \ncommand of English.  \nLane, 1992 \nDeaf people, like most immigrant populations in this country, do attain a level of English \nthat enables them to accomplish basic, routine and reoccurring tasks that involve written English. \nThis variety of English has been called “Deaf English” (Charrow, 1974; 1975), which parallels, \nbut is clearly not as proficient as, the English of those non-deaf people learning English as a second \nlanguage.  \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 18 of 92\n   \nIt should be very clear that relying on standard written English as the primary or only means \nof  communication  with  or  for  most  Deaf  people  simply  cannot  be  an  effective  means  of \ncommunication.  It is the unquestionable ineffectiveness of speech, lip-reading and written English \nwhen communicating with Deaf people that makes the use of qualified sign language interpreters \nnecessary for effective communication. The use of qualified sign language interpreters is also an \nimportant means of effective communication for those late-deafened deaf adults who have learned \nto sign.  \n3.  Limitations Of Lip-Reading And Speech Within The American Deaf \nCommunity  \nAs challenging and ineffective as it is for Deaf people, as a group, to communicate in \nwritten English, it is even more challenging, ineffective and impractical for them to communicate \nsuccessfully via lip-reading (also called speech-reading). Given the challenges Deaf people have \nin acquiring competence in written English, this should not be surprising. Unlike the permanent \npresence of the printed word that makes possible repeated readings, the spoken word is ephemeral. \nGiven that Deaf people struggle for accurate and complete comprehension with the stationary \nwritten word, one cannot expect any greater level of competence or effectiveness when Deaf \npeople try to comprehend the fleeting spoken word as it appears on the speaker’s lips.  \nThe common misconception that most non-deaf people have is that all Deaf people can lip-\nread. They mistakenly believe that, lacking one of their senses, the ability to hear, Deaf people’s \nvisual sense – and hence their ability to lip-read – becomes more acute in order to compensate. \nMost non-deaf people do not understand or appreciate the difficulties and limitations involved in \ntrying to lip-read. It is extremely challenging to lip-read English because only a small fraction of \nthe sounds used in the language are clearly visible. In fact, even someone who is fully fluent in \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 19 of 92\n   \nand who has full auditory access to spoken English would struggle to lip-read English (non-deaf \npeople have only to turn their television set to a Chinese or Russian language program and turn off \nthe volume to experience this frustration firsthand). Consider the difficulty in trying to lip-read \naccurately the spoken English phrase “white shoes.” To a person trying to lip-read this phrase, it \ncould be understood as “white shoes” or “why choose.” When we consider the fact that many of \nthe sounds in English look the same to a lip-reader, it should not be surprising that Deaf people’s \ncomprehension of spoken language is usually quite poor and is always even worse than their \ncompetence in written English.  \nOne has only to look at oneself in a mirror and soundlessly mouth each of the following \npairs of words to have a sense of the impossibility of lip-reading accurately. In each of these pairs \none of the words is listed on the Frye list 4 of the one hundred most commonly occurring words \nin English. \nto/you, in/thin, it/hit, he/she, on/don, are/car, with/width, his/is, \ni/eye, be/bee, or/ore, one/won, by/bye, but/butt, not/knot, your/door, \nan/ant, which/witch, do/due, their/there, out/shout, many/manny, \nthen/ten,  these/he’s,  so/sew,  would/wood,  like/lick,  him/shim, \ntime/thyme,  two/too,  more/moor,  see/she,  no/know,  way/weigh, \nbeen/bin, oil/coil, day/say \nAccording to Bernstein and Auer (2003) “Estimates of the upper extremes for the accuracy of lip-\nreading words in sentences have been as low as 10-30% words correct.” This is in keeping with \nearlier work (Liben, 1978) that also provides evidence that speech-readers understand only about \none fourth of what is said in dyadic (one-to-one) conversations.  \n                                                 \n4 The Frye list consists of the one hundred most common words used in English ranked in order of \nfrequency. \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 20 of 92\n   \nOf course, there are a number of other uncontrollable factors beside the phonetic structure \nof English that make it extremely difficult for d/Deaf people to lip-read with any consistent degree \nof accuracy, such as a person’s facial bone structure, facial musculature, facial hair, lighting, rate \nof speech, etc. (Bernstein and Auer, Jr. 2003). Given the inherent linguistic difficulties in lip-\nreading and the additional complications that arise from external factors, it is no wonder that lip-\nreaders’ comprehension is so limited. \nIf speech-readers understand only approximately a quarter of what is said in dyadic (one-\nto-one) conversations, it should not be surprising that the level of comprehension in small and \nlarge group interactions is significantly less. One reason for this is simply physical distance – the \nfurther away one is from a speaker the more difficult it is to discern fine muscle movements of the \nmouth necessary to lip-read. Another reason is because small group interactions in which a \nmajority of the participants is not deaf generally rely upon turn-taking regulatory mechanisms that \nare auditorily determined, i.e. whoever talks first or loudest claims the floor. This places the d/Deaf \nlip-reader in an impossible position of trying to track who is speaking by waiting for others in the \ngroup to look at the person who is speaking. Deaf people trying to lip-read in small group \ninteractions must constantly determine who is talking by trying to determine who other group \nmembers are looking at. By the time the d/Deaf person has determined who is speaking, the d/Deaf \nperson has already missed the first several seconds of what the speaker has to say. This also means \nthat it is difficult for the d/Deaf person to track who will next claim the floor and is often unable \nto claim a turn him/herself. Large groups pose even greater problems for the lip-reader: problems \nsuch as greater physical distance from the primary speaker, whether or not the primary speaker \nmoves about while talking, variable lighting, and the impossibility of lip-reading questions or \ncomments from anyone in the large group.  \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 21 of 92\n   \nWhen interacting with deaf people who rely on lip-reading to interact in a given situation, \none must exercise extra caution to ensure that the deaf person has actually understood the \ninteraction. This is because deaf lip-readers will often nod their heads, which the non-deaf \ninterlocutor takes as a sign of comprehension. However, this is no different than second language \nusers who engage in the same behavior. For example, students who are just learning American \nSign Language will often and regularly engage in this behavior when communicating with deaf \npeople. They do this, and deaf people do this, not to deceive the other person, but rather to “save \nface.” That is, they do not want the other person to think they are “stupid” or incompetent. Their \nreasoning is that if they actually interrupt the other person each time they do not understand, that \nis precisely the impression they will be creating. They would rather accept the consequences of \nnot comprehending than create an impression of incompetence.  \nIdeally, someone interacting with a deaf person who is relying on lip-reading must be aware \nthat head nodding may not always signal comprehension. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. \nThe result is that the two interlocutors leave the interaction with two different impressions of the \ninteraction. The deaf person leaves with “comprehension gaps” while the non-deaf person leaves \nthinking that the deaf person has fully comprehended. \nGiven  lip-readers’  limited  comprehension  in  one-to-one  interactions  and  given  the \nincreased interactional complexities in small and large group interactions, lip-reading cannot be \nassumed to be an effective and meaningful communicative option for d/Deaf people in such \nsettings.  \nOf course, even if d/Deaf people could lip-read with any reasonable level of accuracy, \nsuccessful communication in those settings would also require that they then express themselves \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 22 of 92\n   \nin intelligible spoken English that, unlike late-deafened adults, they cannot do. Some Deaf people \nhave speech that may be understood in limited contexts; most, however, do not. Despite years of \nspeech training, most Deaf people are generally unable to regulate the volume, timbre or pitch of \ntheir speech and that, among other factors, makes their speech very difficult to understand. Deaf \npeople, never having heard themselves speak, cannot monitor their speech in the way that non-\ndeaf people can. Simply put, Deaf people don’t know how words are supposed to sound; without \nsuch an auditory target they can only approximate the vocal formulation of words. Thus, the speech \nof Deaf people has been described as guttural, animalistic, and unintelligible. \nClearly,  Deaf  people  know  that  their  speech  is  ineffective  as  a  primary  means  of \ncommunication:  they  know  that  those  unfamiliar  with  “Deaf  speech”  have  great  difficulty \nunderstanding their speech; they know not to trust their speech for important interactions; they \nknow that their speech sounds unnatural; and they know that non-deaf people react negatively \nwhen they do use their speech. Thus, unlike late-deafened adults, most Deaf people choose not to \nuse their speech for routine communicative interactions because they know it is unintelligible and \ntherefore not an effective means of communication, or in many cases they simply cannot use their \nspeech. \nIt is true that many late-deafened individuals can be rather skilled lip-readers in some very \ncontrolled conditions (although factors listed above will also negatively impact their lip-reading \naccuracy).  This  is  because,  unlike  those  with  childhood  onset  deafness,  they  have  adult \ncompetence in spoken English to assist in making educated guesses. Unfortunately, their higher \ndegree of accuracy at lip-reading coupled with their quite intelligible speech often lead people who \nare not deaf to conclude that the late-deafened individual is only pretending to be deaf and thus no \nspecial communication accommodations are needed or warranted.  \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 23 of 92\n   \nLate-deafened adults are very likely to have intelligible speech and, because of their \nproficiency in English, are able to lip-read with slightly better accuracy. As noted, this often leads \npeople who are not deaf to assume that the late-deafened adult is “faking” their deafness. But, as \nnoted above, late-deafened adults who retain reasonably intelligible speech present a false image \nto those who are not deaf. They “sound normal” and so the conflation of speech and hearing \nbecomes significant (“if you speak that well, I assume you must be able to hear as well”). That \naudist stereotype often leads to late-deafened adults being misunderstood and discriminated \nagainst because they cannot successfully engage in “normal” communication. That is, while they \ncan express their thoughts in intelligible English, given the severe limitations of lip-reading and \ntheir lack of hearing, they are unlikely to understand what is said to them in response to their ideas. \nFor d/Deaf people as a group, then, lip-reading and speech cannot be assumed to provide a \nreliable and accurate means of communication in most interactions. It is certainly true that in some \ncontext-specific social interactions a variable combination of speech, lip-reading, written words \nand gestures may enable a rudimentary level of low stakes, social communication (e.g. “change \nthe TV channel,” “pass the salt,” “lights out”). However a variable combination of speech, lip-\nreading, written words and gestures would definitely not ensure effective communication in what \nwould be termed “high stakes” interactions. “High stakes” interactions are those in which the risks \nof miscommunication or misunderstanding are high and the consequences of miscommunications \nhave significant, and possibly severe, negative repercussions for the d/Deaf individual.  \nAny list of “high stakes” interactions would certainly have to include disciplinary and/or \ninvestigative proceedings, medical appointments, mental health appointments (both individual and \ngroup counseling sessions), psychological evaluations, any formal evaluation (e.g. behavioral, \neducational, occupational), education sessions (e.g. specific training sessions, general educational \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 24 of 92\n   \nopportunities), religious activities, and instructions concerning health and safety. What these “high \nstakes” interactions have in common is that discussions, suggestions, courses of action and reliable \ndecisions simply cannot be considered valid unless one can ensure that any communication \nbetween parties was conducted in a manner that was accurately conveyed and understood. Given \nthe unreliability of lip-reading, speech and written communication that exists for d/Deaf people, \none simply cannot conclude that relying solely on one or more of those forms of communication \ncan result in accurate and effective communication in “high stakes” interactions. \nThe clear reality is that the only practical way for Deaf people and for many deaf people to \nparticipate effectively in these types of “high stakes” one-to-one interactions, and in any small or \nlarge group interaction, is to employ the services of a qualified sign language interpreter.  \nBecause of the importance of qualified sign language interpreters in ensuring access and \nparticipation, the next section will examine several aspects of sign language interpretation and \nmisconceptions about the nature of sign language interpreting. \nSummary Of Opinions With Respect To Deaf People As A Linguistic Community:  \n•  Those with little or no knowledge of d/Deaf people or American Sign Language make \nnumerous unfounded, stereotypic assumptions about d/Deaf people, their means of \ncommunication and their signed language.  \n•  The most significant factor uniting members of the American Deaf Community is the \nuse of American Sign Language (ASL). \n•  American Sign Language is neither a manual form nor a derivative form of English, \nand thus there is not a one-to-one correspondence between American Sign Language \nsigns and English words.  \n•  The grammatical and syntactic structure of American Sign Language is quite different \nfrom the grammatical and syntactic structure of English. \n•  There is no conventional written form of American Sign Language. \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 25 of 92\n   \n•  As a group, Deaf people face severe challenges in acquiring competence in spoken or \nwritten English, and most Deaf people rarely attain competence in spoken or written \nEnglish. \n•  The average literacy level of the American Deaf Community is significantly lower than \nit is for the population as a whole. \n•  Lip-reading is so unreliable that it cannot be used to ensure comprehension and \neffective communication in any group setting or in any “high stakes” one-on-one \nsetting (i.e. interactions related to health, safety, discipline and the like). \n•  The use of speech for the vast majority of Deaf people is so ineffective that it cannot \nbe relied upon to ensure accurate expression and effective communication. \n•  Late-deafened adults who have reasonably good lip-reading and speech skills, because \nof their previous exposure to spoken English, are often thought to be feigning deafness.  \n•  The only way for Deaf people and for deaf people who have learned sign language to \nparticipate meaningfully and effectively in all group interactions and in all “high \nstakes” one-to-one interactions is to provide a qualified sign language interpreter. \nD.  Sign Language Interpretation: Misconceptions And Certifications  \nGiven the passage of federal laws beginning in the early 1970s, including the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, it is probably safe to say that most non-deaf people have, at one time or another, seen \na sign language interpreter. However, as with other aspects of the lives of d/Deaf people, there are \nseveral misconceptions and naïve assumptions surrounding sign language interpreters.  \nThe first is the belief that anyone who can sign can be a qualified sign language interpreter. \nThe fact is that competence in American Sign Language is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition \nto become a qualified sign language interpreter. This necessary, but not sufficient, condition of \nbilingualism is true for all interpreters whether of spoken or signed languages, and the literature is \nquite clear on this point. (e.g. Seleskovitch, 1978; Frishberg, 1986; Wadensjö, 1998; Cokely, 1992; \nStewart et al, 1998; Janzen, 2005).  \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 26 of 92\n   \nAnother common misconception held by those who are not Deaf is that American Sign \nLanguage is easy to learn and thus one can rather quickly become a qualified sign language \ninterpreter. However, the fact is that learning American Sign Language is as challenging as \nlearning any spoken language; in fact, given the modality differences, many non-deaf students find \nit more challenging to learn American Sign Language than to learn a spoken language. (Peterson, \n1999). \nAnother misconception about sign language interpreting is that signs exist in a one-to-one \nrelationship with English words; that is, for every word there is a sign that conveys that word. \nWere this true, it would mean that interpreting would consist simply of learning the matched signs \nfor the words one already knows and the rather mechanical process of producing the linked signs \nfor the words one hears and, conversely, the spoken words for the signs one sees. However, anyone \nwho has studied another language knows that the vocabularies of any two languages do not map \nin a one-to-one relationship; this is a cross-cultural and linguistic reality well supported by the \nliterature. 5 Likewise, anyone who has studied American Sign Language knows that ASL and \nEnglish do not map to each other in a one-to-one relationship, a realization also well supported by \nthe literature. 6  \nTo begin to understand the cognitive challenges and complexities of interpretation, and \nwhy competence in ASL is a necessary, but not sufficient, prerequisite to qualify as an interpreter, \nit is helpful to have a clear understanding of what interpretation is. The following definition \nprovides such a starting point: \n                                                 \n5 e.g. Larson 1998; Lyons, 1977; 1995; Duranti, 1997; Crystal, 1997; Hatim and Mason, 1997; Weaver, \n1997 \n6 e.g. Stokoe, 1965; Cokely, 1992, 2001; McIntire (ed) 1986; Mindess, 1999 \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 27 of 92\n   \nInterpretation is the competent and coherent use of one naturally \nevolved language to express the meanings and intentions conveyed \nin another naturally evolved language for the purpose of negotiating \nan opportunity for a successful communicative interaction in real \ntime within a triad involving two principal individuals or groups \nwho are incapable of using, or who prefer not to use, the language \nof the other individual or group.  \nCokely, 2001 \nThis is a general definition of interpretation that applies to signed and spoken language \ninterpretation, and one that is well supported in the literature. (e.g. Robinson, 1997; Wadensjö, \n1998; Larson, 1998; Stewart et al, 1998; Pöchhacker, 2004; Janzen, 2005). This definition places \nin proper context the necessary, but insufficient, condition of bilingualism needed to interpret. \nIndeed, it is the ability to determine and then express meaning and intention that is at the heart of \ninterpretation.  \nThe  cognitive  processes  by  which  meaning  and  intention  are  determined  and  then \nexpressed in a different language are quite complex. It has only been in the last quarter of a century \nthat we have begun to understand the process of interpretation; demands of which are such that \ninterpretation has been called “…probably the most complex type of event yet produced in the \nevolution of the cosmos.” (Richards, 1953). While some may say this is hyperbole, it is undeniable \nthat interpretation is an extremely complex cognitive task. In the past three decades, various \nmodels of the cognitive process have emerged that have helped shape and guide our understanding \nof interpretation, research into interpretation, and the training of interpreters (e.g. Moser-Mercer, \n1978; Chernov, 1978; Cokely, 1984, 1992; González et al, 1991). Examining any of these models \nmakes clear the fact that excellent skill in both languages is unquestionably a necessary, but not \nsufficient, prerequisite for interpreters. In fact, in the case of qualified sign language interpreters, \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 28 of 92\n   \nnational certification by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf evolved, in part, to differentiate \nbetween those who could sign and those who could interpret (Cokely, 2005). \nInterpretation generally takes one of two forms – consecutive or simultaneous. Consecutive \ninterpretation often happens in one-to-one interactions such as doctor’s appointments, supervisor \nmeetings and in some legal settings. In diplomatic situations, it may be used when delegates or \ndiplomats deliver speeches. In consecutive interpretation, one of the participants speaks or signs \nand, at a logical semantic or syntactic point, pauses. The interpreter, who may have been taking \nnotes, then begins to interpret what was just said or signed. When the interpreter is done, the \nspeaker continues until the next pause at which time the interpreter begins. This alternating pattern \ncontinues until the speaker is finished. In general, interpreters and participants agree beforehand \nthat the interpretation will proceed consecutively. In one-to-one interactions, the logical pause \npoints may, for instance, be the conclusion of one of the participant’s turns (e.g. asking a question). \nSimultaneous interpretation happens without benefit of regular and planned pauses. In \nsimultaneous interpretation the interpretation is delivered in the same general time frame as the \noriginal. The term “simultaneous” interpretation is actually a misnomer. No interpretation is \ndelivered  perfectly  synchronously  with  the  delivery  of  the  original  message.  Because  the \ninterpreter’s goal is to render the meaning and intent of the original, that means that the interpreter \nmust first comprehend the original message. To do so requires that the interpreter wait to receive \nenough of the original message so that the interpreter is confident in the intended meaning of the \nspeaker or signer. Thus, there is always a small temporal discrepancy between the production of \nthe original message and the production of its interpretation because interpreters must necessarily \nchunk information  that  is coming to them. This temporal difference is called lag time (or \nsometimes by the French term décalage).  \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 29 of 92\n   \nFor at least the last five decades, it has been widely accepted within the Deaf Community \nand  among  those  who  work  with  Deaf  people,  including  interpreters,  that  for  non-social \ncommunicative interactions between Deaf people and those who are not deaf and who cannot sign \nfluently, consecutive or simultaneous interpretation is the only viable option to ensure that Deaf \npeople have effective communicative access and reliable opportunities for participation. No other \nreasonable accommodation at the present time can successfully enable Deaf people and those deaf \npeople who can sign to participate in and benefit from small and large group interactions in real \ntime. One has only to look at the prevalence of interpreters in the education, business, religious, \nentertainment  and  social  service  segments  of  American  society  to  realize  the  widespread \nrecognition and acceptance of the reality that interpreters are the only viable option for Deaf people \nin such settings. For example, the presence of on-camera interpreters during Mayor Bloomberg’s \nregular broadcasts to citizens of New York City during Hurricane Sandy and the growing national \ndiscussion  about  provision  of  interpreting  services  during  emergency  situations  are  clear \nindications of the recognition of the importance of interpreters for effective communication for \nd/Deaf people. At the other end of the spectrum, there was international attention given to the \nfailure to provide effective interpreting services because of the use of a faux interpreter at the \nfuneral services for Nelson Mandela. \nLate-deafened adults who have learned to sign also benefit from and rely upon the services \nof qualified sign language interpreters. Such individuals often rely upon the combination of the \ninterpreter’s signs and lip-reading the interpreter or the speaker in order to have effective and \nreliable  communicative  access,  both  in  small  or  large  group  and  one-on-one  settings.  This \naugmented communication is necessary given the fragmentary nature of lip-reading and the likely \nfragmentary  comprehension  of  signs  by  someone  who  is  late-deafened.  These  sources  of \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 30 of 92\n   \ninformation  work  together  in  a  complementary  fashion  to  ensure  a  greater  level  of \ncomprehensibility than either one does alone. Moreover, when acquiring a second language, the \nnorm is that one’s comprehension of that language always outpaces one’s production of that \nlanguage (think of young children who can always understand more than they can express).  \nAccordingly, late-deafened adults who learn sign language generally comprehend the signs of \nqualified sign language interpreters better than (and faster than) the adult can produce the signs \nthemselves.    Thus,  provision  of  competent  interpreters  is  often  necessary  to  provide \ncommunicative rights and access to someone who is late-deafened.  \nThe national professional organization for qualified sign language interpreters in the United \nStates is the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (http://www.rid.org). Founded in 1964, the \nRegistry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) currently has over 14,000 members nationwide. In \n1972, the RID implemented a national evaluation and certification system that would provide a \nready  means  of  identifying  those  individuals  deemed  qualified  to  interpret.  As  mentioned \npreviously,  the  certification  system  was  motivated,  in  large  part,  by  an  expressed  need  to \ndifferentiate between those who could sign and those who could interpret (Cokely, 2005). For the \npast 44 years, the assessment procedures have been implemented, revised and monitored using \nacceptable psychometric procedures to ensure their validity and reliability (http://www.rid.org).  \nThe Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf also certifies interpreters to work in legal settings. \nAccording to the RID’s 2007 Standard Practice Paper on Legal Interpreting:  \nLegal interpreting encompasses a range of settings in which the deaf \nperson interacts with various parts of the justice system. Legal \ninterpreting naturally includes court interpreting; however, a legal \ninterpreter’s work is not restricted to the courtroom. Rather, legal \ninterpreting  occurs  during  attorney-client  conferences, \ninvestigations by law enforcement, depositions, witness interviews, \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 31 of 92\n   \nreal  estate  settlements,  court-ordered  treatment  and  education \nprograms  and  administrative  or  legislative  hearings.  Legal \ninterpreting requires highly skilled and trained specialists because \nof the significant consequences to the people involved in the event \nof a failed communication.  \nRID, 2007 \nNational assessment and certification of interpreters is a significant factor in ensuring that an \nindividual  possesses  the  range  of  competences  and  capabilities  needed  to  render  effective \ninterpretation.  All  languages  exhibit  sociolinguistic  variation.  Sociolinguistic  variation  will \ninclude, for example, age variation (senior citizens and teenagers may use different vocabulary \nitems), gender variation (men and women may use different vocabulary items and grammatical \nstructures) and geographic variation (people from different parts of the country may have distinct \naccents and/or linguistic patterns). Despite such natural variation, teenagers still communicate with \nsenior citizens, men communicate with women, and people from different parts of the country \ncommunicate with each other. The critical point is that naturally occurring sociolinguistic variation \ndoes not impede communication among different members of a linguistic community. \nAmerican Sign Language, as is true of all signed and spoken languages, also exhibits \nnatural sociolinguistic variation (e.g. Woodward, 1994; Lucas, 2001). This means, for example, \nthat older Deaf people may sign slightly differently than younger Deaf people, Deaf people from \nthe North may sign slightly differently than Deaf people from the South, and Deaf people from \nvarious educational backgrounds may sign slightly differently from each other. Nevertheless, just \nas with spoken English, such naturally occurring linguistic variation does not in any way preclude \nDeaf people from communicating with each other. Certification of interpreters at a national level \nprovides a readily identifiable measure of assurance that the certificate holder possesses the \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 32 of 92\n   \nknowledge and communicative flexibility necessary to interpret successfully for groups of diverse \nDeaf people that embody naturally occurring sociolinguistic variation.  \nSummary Of Opinions With Respect To Sign Language Interpretation: \n•  Competence in American Sign Language and English is a necessary, but not sufficient, \ncondition to become a qualified sign language interpreter. \n•  The cognitive processes involved in interpretation are extremely complex and require \nthe ability to determine meaning and intent. \n•  For non-social communicative interactions between Deaf people and those who are not \ndeaf and who cannot sign fluently, consecutive or simultaneous interpretation provided \nby a qualified interpreter is the only viable option to ensure that Deaf people have \neffective communication access and have reliable opportunities for participation. \n•  Certification of interpreters at a national level provides a readily identifiable measure \nof assurance that the certificate holder possesses the knowledge and communicative \nflexibility necessary to interpret successfully for groups of diverse Deaf people that \nembody naturally occurring sociolinguistic variation. \n•  Late-deafened adults who have learned to sign benefit from and rely upon the services \nof qualified sign language interpreters.  \nE.  d/Deaf And Hard Of Hearing Inmates At FDOC \nBetween June and December 2016, I reviewed a number of documents provided to me by \ncounsel. In August 2016 I visited the following FDOC facilities: Tomoka Correctional Institution \nand Lowell Annex (8/18/2016), Marion Correctional Institution and Union Correctional Institution \n(8/19/2016), Reception and Medical Center Main unit and Columbia Correctional Institution \nAnnex (8/20/2016), Madison Correctional Institution (8/21/2016), Northwest Florida Reception \nCenter Annex and Northwest Florida Reception Center Annex (8/22/2016), Okaloosa Correctional \nInstitute (8/23/2016). During each site visit, I met individually with at least three selected d/Deaf \nor hard of hearing inmates from each facility. I believe these inmates reflect a representative \nsample of all FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. A list of inmates interviewed can be \nfound in Appendix C. During these interviews I was able to identify difficulties that have arisen \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 33 of 92\n   \nfor inmates due to a lack of effective communicative access and was able to make a determination \nabout levels of inmates’ sign language proficiency.  \nBased on my forty-eight years of experience, my separate meetings with inmates, my \ninspection of FDOC facilities, and a review of documents provided to me (see Appendix B), I \nbelieve there are several areas involving a lack of communicative rights and access for FDOC \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates that warrant examination and discussion. Although the inmates \nI  interviewed  have  audiological  and  linguistic  differences  from  the  general  FDOC  inmate \npopulation that are not completely identical, there are a number of common issues across all d/Deaf \nprisoners that require visual accommodations in order to provide them with effective and efficient \ncommunicative access.  \nF.  Necessary Changes ForinmaaFDOC Regarding Treatment Of d/Deaf And Hard \nOf Hearing Inmates \nAs  noted  above,  it  is  simply  not  possible  to  determine  or  infer  effective  means  of \ncommunication solely on the basis of an audiological exam, and certainly not by using a flawed \nclassification based on audiological test results. In attempting to determine the communication \nneeds of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, it is most reasonable to believe that the inmates \nthemselves should be consulted on what means of communication are effective for them. The \npractice  of  not  involving  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  in  identifying  their  own \ncommunication access needs creates and reinforces a pejorative and uninformed audist view that \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates do not know what constitutes effective communication for \nthem.  \nI believe that FDOC must develop and implement procedures that ensure that each d/Deaf \nand  hard  of  hearing  inmate  is  involved  in  any  decisions  about  what  constitutes  effective \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 34 of 92\n   \ncommunication for that specific inmate. Once determined, the means of effective communication \nmust  be  reflected  in  an  inmate’s  individualized  communication  plan.  An  individualized \ncommunication plan would detail what specific means of communication are required for effective \ncommunication with that individual inmate and under what circumstances. That plan should be \npart of the inmate’s record and would follow that inmate in the event of transfer to another facility \nor would be reviewed by any new staff that would have direct contact with that inmate. \n1.  FDOC’s Inability To Ensure Communicative Access For d/Deaf And Hard \nOf Hearing Inmates.  \nBased on my 48 years of experience, my tour of FDOC facilities, my interviews with 30 \nd/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates, and my review of documents, it is clear that FDOC has failed \nto take adequate steps to ensure that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are being provided \neffective  communication.  These  failures  have  serious,  negative  consequences  for  the \ncommunicative rights and access needs of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \nThe lack of a comprehensive, reliable list of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, the lack \nof appropriate and regular training and the failure to involve d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates \nin determining effective communication means that FDOC cannot ensure that it is meeting the \ncommunicative access needs of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. To the extent that FDOC \npersonnel are not proactively ensuring that appropriate communication accommodations are being \nprovided for d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates system-wide, FDOC cannot reliably claim that it \nis providing effective communication and appropriate access for those inmates.  \nI believe that FDOC must develop and implement procedures that ensure that appropriately \ntasked individuals are mandated to act proactively and regularly in order to ensure that FDOC \nfacilities and accommodation decisions are compliant with federal laws. Minimally, this would \n- 34 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 35 of 92\n   \ninclude regular reporting of all FDOC accommodation decisions for those protected by federal \nlaws, but especially those decisions regarding the communicative rights and access needs of d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates. Absent this I believe that FDOC cannot ensure that its facilities are \nreliably and consistently providing effective communication and appropriate access for d/Deaf and \nhard of hearing inmates. \n2.  FDOC’s Reliance Upon Written Communication With d/Deaf And Hard Of \nHearing Inmates.  \nBased on my review of documents and my interviews with d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates, I believe that FDOC’s reliance upon written communication seriously disadvantages \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who have limited literacy skills. While reliance upon written \ncommunication also disadvantages those inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing and who \npossess limited literacy skills, those inmates have other means of readily acquiring needed \ninformation (e.g. communicating directly with FDOC personnel or other inmates) that are not \nreadily available to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates.  \nThere appears to be an assumption by FDOC personnel, including medical and mental \nhealth external vendors, that merely providing written material or exchanging written notes \nprovides  effective  access  for  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates.  I  believe  this  erroneous \nassumption is based on lack of information and training about d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \nIt appears that FDOC relies upon written communication for a number of recurring activities, for \nexample to file grievances or to request accommodations. To the extent that there are not alternate \neffective  means  of,  for  example,  filing  grievances,  requesting  accommodations,  and \ncommunication with nurses and doctors, FDOC seriously disadvantages d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates who have limited literacy skills, and FDOC cannot claim to provide effective \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 36 of 92\n   \ncommunication for those inmates. For example, inmates   (Marion),   \n (NWFRC Annex) and   (Madison) report that while medical personnel \noccasionally will write notes to them, they are not able to understand what is written and thus \ncannot access information vital to their own healthcare. \nWorse, a number of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates at different FDOC facilities \nreported that medical personnel refused to even attempt to write or to let the inmates write to them \n(further discussed below). For example, inmate   (Lowell Annex),   \n(NWFRC Main),   (Union) all stated that medical staff have refused to write with \nthem. As a consequence, they are not provided access to information vital to their own healthcare. \nI believe that FDOC must develop or identify alternate means by which d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates who have limited literacy skills can conduct routine recurring activities that \nnow must be conducted in writing. I also believe that these alternate means must be implemented \nsystem-wide across FDOC. \n3.  FDOC’s Failure To Provide Necessary Visual Alarms And/Or Signals And \nInformation.  \nBased on my tour of FDOC facilities, my review of documents and my interviews with \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, I believe that FDOC has failed to provide effective visual \nalarms and/or signals, and that such failure poses significant risks for d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates. My tour of the FDOC facilities named above which house d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates, revealed no visual alarms and/or signals in any of the areas we visited. Those areas \nincluded medical areas, inmate common areas, inmate open dormitory and inmate cell areas. In \nnone of these locations did I observe any sort of visual alarms or signaling device with the \nexception of fire alarm strobe lights visible in some, but not all, facilities.  \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 37 of 92\n   \nThe lack of adequate visual alarms and/or signaling devices in cases of emergencies poses \nserious and potentially fatal risks for d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. The absence of visual \nalarms means that d/Deaf and some hard of hearing inmates are unable to respond to calls/counts \non their own and with the same level of swiftness as non-d/Deaf inmates. Apparently, in the \nabsence of visual alarms, FDOC relies upon FDOC officers and/or non-d/Deaf inmates to alert \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates of an alarm. But this is clearly an ineffective means of alerting \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. For example,   (Marion),   \n(Madison),   (Madison),   (NWFRC Annex),   \n(Okaloosa),   (Okaloosa),   (Tomoka),   (Tomoka),   \n (Marion),   (Union)  (Union),   (RMC \nMain) all report that they have missed calls and, in the case of missed meal calls, are not allowed \nto eat or have even been issued disciplinary tickets. \nA number of inmates at different facilities report that officers have laminated cards which \nthey hold up at the time of a “call” (e.g. chow, medical, count). These cards are intended to notify \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates of a “call”. This is clearly a non-equivalent level of access. \nThe effectiveness of such cards depends on and assumes that the d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate \nis looking at the card. However, merely holding up a card does not and cannot alert an inmate who \nis preoccupied in the way a PA announcement or an officer yelling alerts inmates who are not \nd/deaf or hard of hearing. While PA announcements or an officer yelling are invasive measures, \nholding up a card is a passive measure designed to inform but not to get one’s attention. \nAs noted above, during my interviews of inmates at each facility, d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates reported that they have missed meals, roll calls and alarms because no one \ninformed them or they did not see a card. They also report that they are disciplined (given tickets) \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 38 of 92\n   \nwhen this happens and it appears to happen often. Clearly, reliance upon FDOC officers and/or \nnon-d/Deaf inmates to alert d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates is a misguided practice that poses \npotentially serious risks for d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates and disadvantages them vis-à-vis \ninmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing.  The receipt of a disciplinary report (DR) can result \nin the d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate losing gain time off his/her sentence, and therefore \npotentially serving a longer prison sentence than inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing. \nIt is very clear that, as a group, d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are unable to hear and \nthus unable to respond to spoken announcements or “move/call” signals that are made over a PA \nsystem or yelled out by officers. While some hard of hearing inmates, when they have their hearing \naid(s) on may know that an announcement is being made (sound localization), they are unable to \nunderstand the content of the announcement. Deaf inmates are not even able to discern that an \nannouncement is being made. Thus, as a group, d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates have virtually \nno equivalent access to information, some of which is potentially life-threatening, that is available \nto all other inmates. In order for d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to be provided with the same \nlevel of information, independence and communicative access as non-deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates, it is my opinion that visible, lighted message-differentiated signal boards must be \nprovided in each of the living quarters, clearly visible in dorm settings and from or within each \ncell that houses a d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate. In addition, FDOC should also consider \ninstalling bed-shaking devices that would vibrate and physically notify d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates. This would also afford d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates a measure of independence. \nI believe that FDOC must install visual alarms and signals in all common areas (e.g. visiting \nareas, medical areas, employment areas, classroom areas, library areas) and, if not in the cell/room \nof each d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate, at least in a location that is clearly visible from all parts \n- 38 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 39 of 92\n   \nof the cell/room. In each facility where a d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate was housed in a cell, I \nentered one cell in each of those facilities. In none of them was an alarm visible through the \nwindow of the cell door. Ideally, instead of a simple light or strobe light, FDOC would install \nlighted message boards that would alert d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to the nature of what \nis being signaled (alarm, lock down, meals, roll call, etc.).  And, importantly, the visual alarms and \nsignals installed should be uniform across all facilities so that a d/Deaf inmate transferred to a \ndifferent facility does not need to learn new alarms and signals. \n4.  FDOC’s  Failure  To  Provide  Interpreters  And  To  Ensure  Effective \nCommunication.  \nBased on my interviews with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, I conclude that FDOC \nhas failed to provide sign language interpreters for interactions involving d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates. When asked about interpreters, inmates responses included: no interpreters at AA \nmeetings ( , Lowell Annex), no interpreters at ADA meetings ( , \nMadison), no interpreters for classes  , Madison), no interpreters provided \nfor classes or religious services for two years ( , NWFRC Annex), no interpreters \nfor classes ( , NWFRC Main), no interpreters at all ( , Okaloosa), no \ninterpreters for GED classes ( , Okaloosa), none for medical appointments (  \n, Tomoka), none for medical or classes ( , Tomoka), no interpreters provided at all \n( , Union). Based on these interviews and a review of policies and procedures, I \nbelieve that interpreters are usually not provided for disciplinary hearings, work opportunities (e.g. \nPRIDE). Clearly there is a systemic failure to provide interpreters for critical interactions involving \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates.  \n- 39 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 40 of 92\n   \nAs  noted  above,  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  need  qualified  sign  language \ninterpreters in order to communicate effectively in all group interactions and in all “high stakes” \n(examples  described  above)  one-on-one  interactions.  While  most  of  the  FDOC  inmates  I \ninterviewed reported that they required the services of an interpreter in order to communicate \neffectively, the fact is that FDOC personnel need interpreters as much as the d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates do. It is not simply one party in an interaction who needs interpretation services; \ninterpreters are needed because the participants do not have a shared language and thus cannot \ncommunicate directly or effectively with each other. An interpreter is needed not because someone \nis d/Deaf or hard of hearing; an interpreter is needed because counselors, doctors, hearing officers, \netc. do not know American Sign Language and because d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates do not \nhave reliable access to spoken English. FDOC’s failure to provide interpreters makes it clear that \nit does not view provision of interpreters as necessary for its personnel to do their jobs. Absent the \nprovision of interpreters, FDOC cannot claim that its counselors, doctors, hearing officers, etc. are \nable to communicate effectively with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in group interactions and \nin all “high stakes” one-on-one interactions.  \nAt one facility a Deaf inmate with diabetes  , Tomoka) reported that for \nyears he routinely received a regular, single injection from the prison’s medical facility always \nwithout an interpreter. He stated that one day several months ago, he reported to medical, again \nwith no interpreter, and on that day was given two injections. He had, and to this day still has no \nidea whether each injection was half a dose or whether his diabetes had worsened so that he needed \na double dose. Yet another Deaf inmate reported that for years he had regularly taken five \nmedications ( , NWFRC Annex), one of which was for a heart condition. Again, no \ninterpreter was present when he was given his medications. He stated that one day he reported to \n- 40 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 41 of 92\n   \nmedical,  without  an  interpreter,  and  was  given  only  four  medications  –  but  not  his  heart \nmedication. He was never given his heart medication again. He had, and to this day still has no \nidea whether this was/is a medical staff oversight or whether his heart condition changed so that \nhe no longer needs the heart medication. Another Deaf inmate ( , Marion) stated \nthat he has had leg problems and, without an interpreter, was unable to accurately describe the \nsymptoms to medical personnel and they were unable to properly treat his leg problems. He also \nreported that he was given an eye exam, again without an interpreter, and was given a glasses \nprescription that caused him headaches and as a result he stopped wearing his glasses. His requests \nfor another appointment with an interpreter were ignored. \nFDOC’s failure to provide interpreters was reported at all facilities I visited. Inmates I \ninterviewed at all facilities reported that interpreters are not routinely provided for “high stakes” \ninteractions. Two of the inmates I interviewed ( , Okaloosa;  , NWFRC \nMain) reported that “inmate interpreters” were used on more than one occasion. This practice of \nusing “inmate interpreters” is highly problematic and troublesome for a number of reasons. \nHere it is worth stressing that there is a difference between “social signers” (i.e. individuals \nwho know how to sign and may, in some very limited and low risk situations be able to facilitate \ncommunication between d/Deaf and hard of hearing people and non-deaf people) and qualified, \ncertified interpreters. The level of competence achieved by these “social signers” is clearly not the \nlevel of fluency required to interpret with accuracy, fidelity and fluidity, which are necessary for \neffective communication.  \nWithout proper training, these “social signers” turned interpreters are likely to be unaware \nof the linguistic and structural differences between ASL and English. They also are likely to think \n- 41 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 42 of 92\n   \nthat the goal of interpreting is nothing more than rendering a sign for each word they hear or vice \nversa, when the essence of interpretation lies in determining meaning and intent and, as discussed \nabove, discarding the form (i.e. the words or signs) of the original message. Finally, these “social \nsigners/faux interpreters” are likely to be unable to manage and control lag time in order to deal \nwith more structurally dense or complex messages.  \nAnother, perhaps more important issue that must be considered is that employee or inmate \n“social signers/faux interpreters” will often have an interest in the material that they are signing or \nspeaking. Someone acting as an interpreter who has a vested interest in the outcome of an \ninteraction (e.g. a disciplinary meeting) will be unable to maintain the level of neutrality and \nobjectivity required to accurately communicate the interaction. In addition, there are potential \nHIPAA violations by involving someone in an interaction who is not bound by confidentiality. By \ncontrast, certified interpreters provide a level of measured, objective neutrality in their work that \nsigning co-workers or fellow inmates may be unable to do so. Like doctors and lawyers, certified \ninterpreters are bound by a professional code of ethics and conduct and pledge to maintain \nconfidentiality,  neutrality,  impartiality  and  objectivity  in  their  work \n(http://www.rid.org/ethics/code/index.cfm); “social signers/faux interpreters” are bound by no \nsuch code of ethics or ethical code of conduct. \nNumerous d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates across all FDOC facilities I visited report \nthat they wish to take educational (GED) and/or self-help programs (e.g. AA, NA) available to the \ngeneral inmate population. However, without sign language interpreters, they are unable to \nparticipate in or benefit from such classes or programs. Thus, the benefits available to the inmate \npopulation in general are denied to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. Failure to provide \ninterpreting services is not isolated by interaction type (e.g. medical, educational, disciplinary) nor \n- 42 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 43 of 92\n   \nis it isolated by facility (failure to provide interpreters was reported at all FDOC facilities I visited). \nIn my opinion there is a systemic failure on the part of FDOC to provide interpreters so that d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates have access to the services and programming available to the general \ninmate population. \nFinally, a number of inmates expressed frustration at the delays in receiving appropriate \nresponses to grievances they file. They report that grievances are routinely denied. They also report \nthat grievances regarding provision of interpreting services, after being denied, are often referred \nto medical for resolution. Such delays mean that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are not \nprovided the same timely response to grievances as those inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of \nhearing. Identification of what is needed for effective communication for each inmate should be \nclearly indicated on each d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate’s file. This would be significantly \nfacilitated by a statewide system and, at least in cases involving provision of interpreters, reduce \ngrievance response time.  \nI believe that in order to have meaningful and effective communication between FDOC \nemployees and d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in all group interactions and an in all “high \nstakes”  one-on-one  interactions,  and  to  provide  communicative  access  to  educational  and \ntherapeutic programming throughout the FDOC system, FDOC must provide sign language \ninterpretation by state or nationally credentialed sign language interpreters.  \n5.  FDOC’s  Failure  To  Provide  Valid  And  Reliable  Communication \nAssessments.  \nBased on my review of documents submitted, my knowledge and experience, and my \nreview of documents, I believe that FDOC’s audist actions clearly speak louder than its words in \nthe matter of valid and reliable language/communication skills and needs assessments of d/Deaf \n- 43 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 44 of 92\n   \nand hard of hearing inmates. FDOC personnel’s view of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates means \nthat, as noted above, they rely on medical personnel to determine whether interpreting services are \nneeded for individual d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates. This means that the determination of \neffective means of communication with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates lies in the hands of \nmedical personnel who, more than likely, do not know American Sign Language and, more \nimportantly, do not know how to assess effective communication when interacting with d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates. The determination of effective means of communication with d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates should be made by language or communication specialists who are \nfluent in sign language and by d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates themselves. \nBased on my review of documents it appears that no one is responsible for assessing overall \ncommunication/language skills and that there is no clear assessment of ASL proficiency for d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates. This should be done when the inmate first enters the FDOC at the \nreception centers.  Without valid language and communication assessments, d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates are significantly disadvantaged relative to inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of \nhearing, and are also denied opportunities available to inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of \nhearing. The fact that one uses another language, spoken or signed, is in no way an accurate or \nvalid indicant of one’s capabilities. What is valid is that if those whose first language is “sign \nlanguage” are not provided appropriate and effective means of communicative access to various \nservices and programming (e.g. educational and vocational), they will not be able to successfully \naccess such services or programming. The fault lies not in those whose first language is “sign \nlanguage” but rather in the failure of FDOC to provide effective communicative access to services \nand programs.  \n- 44 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 45 of 92\n   \nI believe that FDOC must provide language/communication skills and needs assessments \nof d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates by qualified individuals during intake at the reception \ncenters, and that the process for determining what language/communication skills and needs \nassessments of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates require for effective communication to occur \nmust include those d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in making those determinations.  \n6.  FDOC’s Lack Of VRI Is Problematic And Inadequate.  \nBased on my tour of FDOC facilities, my review of documents and my interviews with \nd/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates,  I  believe  that  FDOC’s  failure  to  use  Video  Remote \nInterpreting  (VRI)  services  for  emergency  “high  stakes”  interactions  (e.g.  medical  and \ndisciplinary) is inadequate, ineffective and problematic. VRI enables two people in the same \nlocation who cannot communicate effectively (e.g. a d/Deaf inmate and a nurse/doctor) to connect \nwith an interpreter situated in another physical location. VRI is basically an on-demand service so \nthere is no delay in waiting to schedule an in-person interpreter. However, reliance on wireless \nconnectivity in certain facilities may mean that VRI cannot be a reasonable alternative to in-person \ninterpreting. However, in those facilities I believe that FDOC must use hard-wired Ethernet \nconnectivity to ensure reliable VRI access. \nEven if the apparent bandwidth issue could be addressed (as it should be), the physical size \nof the FDOC facilities makes dedicated VRI units in the medical areas, disciplinary/hearing rooms \nand individual counseling rooms appropriate and necessary. Absent this, FDOC cannot claim to \nprovide d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with effective communication and a comparable level \nof communicative access as is enjoyed by non-d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \n- 45 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 46 of 92\n   \nTo the extent that FDOC personnel are not using VRI for complete “high stakes” (e.g. \nmedical and disciplinary) interactions whenever in-person interpreting is not available, it cannot \nclaim to be providing effective communication with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in such \ninteractions. \nI believe that in order to have meaningful and effective communication between FDOC \npersonnel and for d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates via VRI, FDOC must ensure that the internet \nbandwidth is sufficient to provide reliable video access. I also believe that in order to provide rapid \nresponse to unscheduled “high stakes” interactions, at a minimum FDOC must have VRI units in \nthe medical, disciplinary and counseling areas of each facility that has a d/Deaf or hard of hearing \ninmate. Further, FDOC should use VRI only when an in-person interpreter is not available.  It has \nbeen my experience that greater internet bandwidth is more readily available near major urban \nareas.  It is for this reason and others that I have recommended that d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates be placed in correctional facilities closer to major urban areas. \n7.  FDOC’s Provision Of Telephonic Access Is Problematic And Ineffective.  \nBased on my tour of FDOC facilities, my experience and knowledge, my review of \ndocuments and my interviews with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, I believe that FDOC’s \ncurrent practices and procedures provide d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with significantly \nless equivalent and effective telephonic access than inmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing.  \nIn particular, d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in FDOC facilities are provided limited \naccess to a TTY relative to the access other inmates have to regular telephones. There are several \nlimitations to TTYs, however. One limitation is that this direct point-to-point TTY communication \nrequires that both parties have TTYs. Although TTYs are free, federally mandated TTY relay \n- 46 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 47 of 92\n   \nservices have, in the past, provided a significant level of communication access for d/Deaf and \nhard of hearing people, the fact is that TTY technology has essentially become obsolete for reasons \ndiscussed below. Also because a TTY conversation is typed, TTY conversations always take more \ntime than if the conversation had been spoken or signed. One has only to compare the difference \nbetween telegraphic communication (using Morse Code) and telephonic communication (using \nspoken English) to have a rough parallel to the levels of access provided by TTYs and telephones.  \nBecause TTYs are essentially obsolete, it is increasingly unlikely that those with whom \nFDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates wish to communicate will even own TTYs. For \nexample, inmates   (NWFRC Annex),   (Madison) and   \n  (Marion)  all  report  that  their  families  do  not  own  a  TTY  thus  making  direct \ncommunication with their families impossible. However, they each report that their families have \nvideophones (discussed below) which would make direct communication possible. \nFor different reasons, a TTY does not provide FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates \nwith effective communication with those outside FDOC. In order to use a TTY effectively, the \nuser must be proficient in written English and, as described above, many d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates do not communicate effectively in English. Thus, for those inmates a TTY does \nnot provide telephonic access that is reasonably equivalent to the level of access available to non-\ndeaf inmates. \nIn addition to the limitations noted above, inmates report that TTY calls are more expensive \nthan regular telephone calls. A number of inmates (e.g.  , Tomoka;  , \nOkaloosa;  , Tomoka;  , Marion) all report that they do not make \nTTY calls as often as they would like because of the increased cost.  At several facilities I visited \n- 47 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 48 of 92\n   \nor documents I reviewed, it was frequently reported that the TTY did not work, the officer in \ncharge of the TTY did not know how to operate it, and at one institution the officer took the TTY \nout of the box for the first time and did not have any idea how it operated. Additionally d/Deaf and \nhard of hearing inmates, unlike all other inmates, must request that the TTY be brought to them \nwhich delays their telephonic access relative to other inmates. At some facilities I visited the TTY \nwas located in a different building in the facility resulting in a significant delay in obtaining the \nTTY thus providing an unequal level of telephonic access to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \nWhile there is an FDOC policy/procedure that provides d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates double \ntime when they use TTYs, some inmates report that they were not provided double time. Doing so \nresults in d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates having truncated telephonic access via TTY. There \nis some question whether this policy/procedure is reliably and consistently being followed. \nFor many d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who have intelligible speech and proficiency \nin reading English, new telephone technology exists that would provide them with a level of \ncommunicative  access  equivalent  to  other  inmates.  This  technology,  captioned  telephone \n(CapTel), allows a d/Deaf or hard of hearing caller with intelligible speech to place a telephone \ncall to anyone who has a regular telephone. Using CapTel, inmates would place their call and speak \ndirectly to the other party. The other party would then speak in response to the inmate. The other \nparty’s spoken response would then be converted to on-screen text that the inmate could read. For \nlate-deafened, educated native speakers of English who possess the literacy skills necessary, the \nuse of CapTel would give them an equivalent level of telephonic access as other non-deaf inmates. \nThe use of CapTel is especially effective for individuals who lose their hearing later in life and \nthose who have intelligible speech.  For example, inmate   (Union) specifically \nstated that he would like to have access to CapTel because he cannot use the telephone directly. It \n- 48 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 49 of 92\n   \nis my opinion that to ensure effective communication, FDOC must provide d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates who have intelligible speech and proficiency in English with CapTel access \nreasonably equivalent to the level of access as other non-deaf inmates have to regular telephones. \nFor some d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, CapTel is not at all a viable option because \nof their unintelligible speech and extremely limited English proficiency. During the past fifteen \nyears, Deaf people have eagerly and quickly replaced TTYs with Videophones (VPs) over the last \n10 to 15 years for two very understandable reasons. First, TTYs require communication in typed \nEnglish (the second language for most d/Deaf and hard of hearing people and a language in which, \nas  noted  above,  they  rarely  attain  any  significant  level  of  fluency).  Second,  because  TTY \nconversations are typed, those conversations take significantly longer and thus when d/Deaf or \nhard of hearing people use TTYs they tend to keep conversations very brief (e.g. to make \narrangements to meet in person). VPs, by contrast, enable d/Deaf and hard of hearing people to \ncommunicate  using  American  Sign  Language,  a  language  in  which  they  are  much  more \ncomfortable and fluent. Thus, their VP conversations are not encumbered by written English nor \nslowed by having to type. Signed VP conversations are exactly analogous to spoken telephone \nconversations. A significant advantage to VP conversations relative to TTY calls is that, other than \nthe institutional cost of the internet connection, there is no per call cost.  \nIf each party has a VP then they can communicate directly; however, if only one party has \na VP then communication with the party who does not have a VP is only possible using a free \nVideo Relay Service (VRS), which utilizes the same hardware/software as the VP. Either party \ncan initiate communication by connecting with a VRS provider and a VRS interpreter will \nfacilitate the call, communicating via VP with the d/Deaf or hard of hearing caller and via voice \nwith the non-deaf caller. If calling someone who does not have a VP, d/Deaf and hard of hearing \n- 49 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 50 of 92\n   \ninmates would use the VP to call a VRS center where a qualified ASL interpreter will answer. The \nd/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate then provides the phone number he wishes to call and the ASL \ninterpreter places the call. The d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate signs to the interpreter who then \ninterprets into spoken English for the non-deaf person on the other end of the phone line, and also \ninterprets that person’s spoken English into ASL for the d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate.  \nThere is no cost to the individual for using VRS other than the cost of internet connectivity. \nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Telecommunications Relay \nFund to fund the costs of Telecommunication Relay Services (established under Title IV of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act). Funding comes from rate adjustments or surcharges on local \ntelephone bills that are set annually by the FCC. Companies that offer Video Relay Services (VRS) \nare paid from the TRS fund and those companies provide free Videophone equipment to d/Deaf \nindividuals and companies/entities with d/Deaf employees. In addition to the fact that the only cost \nfor  a  VP  is  the  internet  connection,  a  major  advantage  is  that  VPs  allow  Deaf  people  to \ncommunicate directly in ASL. A secure VP that is as accessible to d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates as telephones are to non-deaf inmates is necessary to provide them an equivalent level of \ntelephonic access as is provided to non-deaf inmates.  \nThe FCC has also encouraged correctional facilities to move beyond the use of antiquated \nTTYs: \nAccess to more advanced forms of TRS, including VRS, IP Relay, CTS, \nand IP CTS, may be necessary to ensure equally effective telephone \nservices for these inmates. We recognize that some facilities have already \nbegun providing access to alternative forms of TRS, often as the result of \nlitigation brought under these other statutes. We strongly encourage other \nfacilities to continue this trend voluntarily, without the need for further \nlitigation. (FCC, 2015) \n \n- 50 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 51 of 92\n   \nA number of state DOCs have installed and make use of VideoPhones which also allow \ninmates to use VRS. Among those state DOCs are Maryland, Maine, Vermont, Virginia and \nWisconsin. \nWhat is most important, however, is that a d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate’s effective \ntelephonic communication cannot be determined simply by the results of an audiogram or an \noverly simplistic classification. For all these reasons it should be clear why d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates must be involved in determining what counts as effective communication. \nIt is my opinion that in each facility housing d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, FDOC \nmust make at least one CapTel phone readily and permanently available to d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates who have telephonically intelligible speech to make it possible for them to access \npoint-to-point telephone calls. Further, I believe that FDOC must provide access to VPs for d/Deaf \nor hard of hearing inmates and access to Video Relay Service (VRS) providers for them to have \ntelephone services and benefits that are equivalent to those afforded non-deaf inmates. Provision \nof a VP would also help reduce the communicative isolation of some d/Deaf or hard of hearing \ninmates because they would be able to communicate directly with other Deaf people or with fluent \ninterpreters.   \n8.  Inadequate And Ineffective Access To Television Programming. \nMany of the FDOC facilities I visited had 19 inch analog televisions mounted ten feet \nabove floor level. Although most of the televisions that I saw had captions displayed, the captions \nwere illegible because of the small size of the television and the distance from the viewer. In some \nfacilities d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates reported that the captions were turned on just before \nmy visit but were not routinely displayed. I was told that FDOC relies on donated television sets \n- 51 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 52 of 92\n   \nprovided to FDOC when donors purchase new television sets. The current practice in many on the \nFDOC facilities I visited provides the illusion of access without meaningful access. I believe that \nFDOC must provide large screen televisions so that captions are accessible to d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates. \nThere are a number of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who benefit from the use of \nradio transmitters (using the telecoil setting on their hearing aids or special receivers) to access the \naudio portion of television programming. However, despite a previous legal ruling, inmates report \nthat facilities have failed to provide or install these transmitters (e.g.  , Okaloosa; \n, Union). I believe that, in addition to providing legible captioning, FDOC must \nprovide TV transmitters and radio receivers for those d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who can \nbenefit from them.  For it does the hard of hearing no benefit whatsoever for the TV to have radio \ntransmitters if the FDOC does not also provide the hard of hearing with a telecoil device and radio \nreceiver for the hearing aid.  Providing the hard of hearing with a telecoil device and radio \ntransmitter so the inmate can hear the TV is no different in kind than providing the visually \nchallenged with a pair of glasses so he can see the TV.  It is simply a different reasonable \naccommodation. \n9.  Inadequate And Ineffective Provision Of Hearing Aids.  \nIt appears that the standard policy at FDOC is to provide d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates with a single hearing aid. In my opinion this is problematic for several reasons. A single \nhearing aid may not enable a d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate to locate the source of a sound (echo \nlocation) and may adversely affect that inmates balance. Indeed, a number of inmates report that \nthey had two aids before entering the FDOC system and that they have continuing difficulties \nadjusting to only a single aid (e.g.  , Union;  , Okaloosa;  , \n- 52 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 53 of 92\n   \nRMC Main;  , NWFRC Main;  , NWFRC Main). Some inmates (e.g. \n, Union) results in ringing in the unaided ear or that they no longer wear the single \naid because of the problems it causes (e.g.  , Columbia Annex). The provision of \nonly a single aid for inmates who need two is analogous to providing a glasses wearer with only \none lens. An FDOC policy of providing only one lens would clearly be seen as unacceptable and \nineffective. Inmates also report that they are denied requests for new ear molds, batteries or repair \nof their aids. I believe that FDOC must reexamine and revise its policy of providing only a single \naid  to  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  and  should  reexamine  its  policy  of  only \nreplacing/upgrading hearing aids every four years. \n10.  Inadequate Training Orientation Of FDOC Personnel  \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates report that they are regularly maltreated by FDOC \npersonnel. The vast majority of inmates that I interviewed (24 out of 30) report such maltreatment \nby FDOC personnel. This maltreatment includes harassment, being teased by officers, officers \ncursing  and  swearing  at  them,  mocking  their  use  of  signing,  being  threatened  by  officers, \nretaliation for requesting an interpreter, total indifference by officers, accusing them of faking their \nhearing abilities, overall negative attitudes, among other complaints.  \nSuch treatment stems from ignorance and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998). As noted \nabove, most people who are not deaf have very uninformed beliefs about and attitudes toward deaf \npeople. Without appropriate training and information, they then seek evidence or support for their \nexisting beliefs or opinions. Based on my interviews at FDOC facilities, it is clear that FDOC \npersonnel have uninformed beliefs about d/Deaf and hard of hearing people and confirmation bias \nsupports those uniformed beliefs. To address this, I believe that FDOC must institute regular and \nmandatory training for all FDOC personnel who interact with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \n- 53 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 54 of 92\n   \nI believe that FDOC must provide regular orientation and training sessions to FDOC personnel \n(officers, counselors, and medical personnel) that present the communicative access rights and \nneeds of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates from a social and communicative perspective rather \nthan simply an audist, medical perspective. \n11.  Inadequate Employment Opportunities for d/Deaf And Hard Of Hearing \nInmates \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates report that the FDOC employment opportunities \navailable to them are limited to being housemen and house women even though they wish other \ntypes of employment (e.g.  , Union;  , NWFRC Main;  , \nNWFRC Annex;  , Okaloosa;  , Okaloosa).  I was told that a “houseman” \nis akin to custodial staff for the dorm; they wipe down tables, mop floors, and clean up the dorm.  \nMany times these tasks can be completed rather quickly, thus leaving the inmate with nothing to \ndo for the rest of the day.  This lack of opportunities can contribute to social isolation and inhibit \nrehabilitation by not giving the inmate a sense of purpose while in prison.  They are specifically \ntold that they cannot have other types of employment because “you’re deaf”, “you’re disabled”, \n“you can’t hear”. This is clearly discrimination on the basis of audiological status, i.e. audism. \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are also denied opportunities to participate in re-entry \nprograms, work release programs, PRIDE programs and other employment opportunities (e.g. \n, Okaloosa;  , Okaloosa;  , NWFRC Annex;  , \nNWFRC Main;  , Union;  , Madison). Once again, they report \nthat they are denied these opportunities, especially re-entry programs, simply because of their \naudiological status. These inmates report that requests for interpreters in order to participate in \nthese programs are routinely denied. This is another example of ignorance, confirmation bias and \n- 54 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 55 of 92\n   \naudism as noted above. Again, I believe FDOC must provide regular training for FDOC personnel. \nAppropriately informed decision makers would improve opportunities and access for d/Deaf and \nhard of hearing inmates to enable them to secure appropriate and meaningful employment.  \n12.  FDOC Consolidation Of d/Deaf And Hard Of Hearing Inmates. \nBased on my knowledge and experience, my tour of FDOC facilities, my interviews with \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates and my review of documents, I believe that the current FDOC \npractice of dispersing d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates throughout the FDOC statewide system \nis problematic for several reasons. First, this practice means that the communication access \naccommodations discussed above must be provided at each facility that houses a d/Deaf or hard \nof hearing inmate. Based on my interviews with d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates it is clear that \nthis practice does not provide effective and efficient communication access for d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates. Second, this practice makes it very likely that cost will be invoked as a reason for \nnot providing effective and efficient communication access. Indeed, cost was reported by a number \nof d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates as the reason why interpreters were not being provided. \nThird, this practice makes it possible that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates might be housed in \nwhat can only be described as communicative solitary confinement, i.e. housed in a facility in \nwhich they are unable to have meaningful, extended communication with other inmates. Fourth, \nselecting facilities near large metropolitan areas makes it much more likely that regular access to \nqualified, credentials interpreters can be provided, and access to better bandwidth for internet \nservices for VP and VRI. Fifth, selecting facilities near large metropolitan areas would enable \nFDOC to contract with local hearing aid dealers/repair facilities that would significantly reduce \nthe time that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates have to wait for their aids to be repaired, and not \nhave to wait to be transferred to Lake Butler for all hearing aid repairs which is apparently the \n- 55 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 56 of 92\n   \ncurrent procedure.  There are large hearing aid centers near major metropolitan areas which \nprovide a higher quality hearing aids and hearing aid repair at a fraction of the cost of other \nproviders.  \nI believe that FDOC should consider consolidating d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in \n3-5 FDOC facilities located near major metropolitan areas. This would result in significant system \nwide cost savings by making only 3-5 facilities fully accessible for d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates rather than making each facility in the FDOC system accessible. It would also create a \ncritical mass of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in those facilities would then make it more \nlikely that FDOC personnel in those facilities would be more aware of and sensitive to the visual \naccess needs of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates.  It is also important to ensure that there are a \nsufficient number of geographically dispersed institutions, to ensure that an inmate is not housed \nan in institution that is far from family or friends.  It is also important to stress that these institutions \nmust vary by classification/security designation (e.g., institutions that can hold high and low risk \nsecurity inmates, close management facilities, and facilities with a sufficient level of medical care). \nFinally, being located near larger metropolitan areas would provide easier and more reliable access \nto interpreter referral agencies and a larger pool of interpreters. It also would reduce travel time to \nDOC facilities which is an important consideration for interpreters. Additionally, it would make it \npossible to use local hearing aid repair facilities which would greatly decrease turn-around time \nfor repairs. \n13.  Inadequate Or Non-Existent FDOC Policies And Procedures. \nBased on my knowledge and experience, my tour of FDOC facilities, my interviews with \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates and my review of documents, I have found that many of \nFDOC’s failures in ensuring effective communication with/by d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates \n- 56 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 57 of 92\n   \nare a result of FDOC’s failure to implement, and ensure the consistent application of, adequate \nsystem–wide institutional policies and procedures concerning those inmates. FDOC should have \nin place policies and procedures that, at the very least:  \n(1)  implement  procedures  that  ensure  that  appropriately  tasked \nindividuals are mandated to act proactively and regularly in order to ensure that \nFDOC facilities and accommodation decisions are compliant with federal laws \nensure an in-depth assessment of the communication needs of d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates, involving the inmates themselves, as soon as possible upon \nentry into the prison system  \n(2) ensure adequate and reliable tracking of d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates as they move throughout the system  \n(3) ensure notification of facility level officials upon the arrival of a \nd/Deaf or hard hearing inmate at their facility  \n(4) provide comprehensive guidelines for the provision of all necessary \naccommodations to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates (not merely piecemeal \nguidelines  or  procedures  that  address  limited  accommodations  at  certain \nfacilities that house d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates) \n(5)  require  annual  audits  to  evaluate  compliance  and  allow  for \nimprovement \n(6) examine the policy of cuffing d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates \nbehind their backs, a practice which eliminates their ability to communicate by \nwriting, gesturing or signing  \n(7) examine the current grievance procedures and the reasons for the \nconstant  delays  reported  by  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates. \nImplementation of the current grievance procedures seems to place an undue \nburden on d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \n- 57 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 58 of 92\n   \nThe current lack of appropriately implemented policies and procedures, and the failure to \nrecognize the lack of and need for enforcing such policies and procedures, has resulted in a system \nin which there is no uniform approach to providing the accommodations needed to ensure effective \ncommunication with d/Deaf or hard hearing inmates. \n14.  Providing Adequate Communicative Access.  \nHere it is worth noting that at least one other state prison system has taken appropriate steps \nto address access issues of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. As my cv indicates, in 2010 I was \nan expert witness in a class action lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Corrections (Minis, \net al v VDOC). The issues faced by Virginia d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are the same \nissues faced by d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in Florida. In 2010 the Virginia Department of \nCorrections signed a consent decree that, in my opinion, committed VDOC to provide appropriate \nand adequate remedies to these access issues. I believe that this decree serves as a model for \nproviding effective communication and communication access.  \nGiven that FDOC does not provide d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with appropriate \nvisual alarms/signals, has not provided d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with an equivalent level \nof telephonic communication as enjoyed by other inmates, and has not provided d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates with regular services of qualified interpreters, I believe that the following \nremedies must be put in place in order for FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to have a \nlevel of effective communication and a level of communicative access similar to that enjoyed by \ninmates who are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing: \na)  I  believe  that  FDOC  must  provide  qualified,  professional, \ncredentialed interpreters for all “high stakes” interactions involving \n- 58 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 59 of 92\n   \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates which clearly include, but are \nnot  limited  to,  disciplinary  and  investigative  meetings,  medical \nappointments  and  visits,  appointments  with \npsychologists/psychiatrists and/or other mental health professionals, \noffender  treatment  programming,  meetings  with  facility \nadministration, meetings with counselors, classification officers, \nreligious activities, classes and/or educational opportunities. In my \nopinion, failure to do so means that FDOC cannot accurately state \nthat  it  is  providing  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  with \n“qualified interpreters” (state or nationally credentialed) needed to \npermit meaningful and effective communication. In addition to high \nstakes situations as discussed above, all “public” events and group \nsettings such as classes and/or educational opportunities or group \nmeetings  clearly  require  professional  interpreting  services  for \nd/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates. Since classes, meetings and other \nregular  recurring  events  have  set  schedules,  interpreter  referral \nagencies should be retained to provide interpreters for such events. \nIf FDOC facilities are located near large metropolitan areas this \nmakes provision of interpreters more reliable and efficient. For a \nnumber of obvious reasons, interpreting services should not be \nprovided by inmates or by correctional personnel. \nb)  I believe that FDOC must provide those d/Deaf or hard of hearing \ninmates who have telephonically intelligible speech and are literate \n- 59 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 60 of 92\n   \nin English with access to a captioned telephone (CapTel) that will \nallow them the same level of telephonic freedom experienced by \nnon-deaf inmates. This will enable those d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates to place approved calls directly to friends, family and other \nindividuals or businesses with whom they may wish to have contact \n— the same telephonic access provided to non-deaf inmates.  \nc)  I believe that FDOC must provide d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates \nwho do not have telephonically intelligible speech or who do not \npossess sufficient literacy to use a TTY or a CapTel with access to \na  Videophone  (VP).  This  will  allow  them  the  same  level  of \ntelephonic freedom experienced by non-deaf inmates by enabling \nthem to place approved calls directly to those who also have a VP \nor, using the free FCC-funded VRS interpreters, to place calls to \nfriends, family and other individuals or businesses with whom they \nmay wish to have contact who do not have a VP. Again it is critical \nto involve the d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmate in decisions about \nwhat  equipment  will  provide  them  with  effective  telephonic \ncommunication. \nd)  I believe that FDOC must install Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) \nunits in strategic locations in each facility that houses a d/Deaf or \nhard of hearing inmate, given that it is not reasonable or practical \nfor FDOC to have on-staff interpreters present at all times. While it \nis true that, for most interactions, a physically present interpreter is \n- 60 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 61 of 92\n   \npreferred whenever possible, technology now offers this additional \noption.  \ne)  In my opinion, the installation of VRI equipment at least in the \nmedical  facilities  office  and  rooms  in  which  disciplinary  and \ncounseling meetings might occur is necessary to provide a much \nmore appropriate level of communicative access for d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates and would provide that access in an immediate \nand timely manner. VRI service is an on-demand service, available \nseven days a week, twenty-four hours per day, and some companies \nwill bill only for minutes used rather than to the nearest half hour. \nUsing VRI to supplement the physically present interpreter, d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates and officials at FDOC facilities will \nnever have to experience inordinate and inappropriate delays in \nbeing able to communicate efficiently and effectively with each \nother in such settings. This will also ensure that in these “high \nstakes” settings FDOC is able to provide “an interpreter who is able \nto interpret effectively, accurately and impartially both receptively \nand  expressively,  using  any  necessary  specialized  vocabulary.” \n(http://www.ada.gov/taman3.htm.) \nIt  is  my  opinion  that  VRI  should  be  used  to  supplement,  but \ndefinitely  not  replace,  regularly  scheduled  physically  present \ninterpreters. There are a number of interpreted interactions that are \nbest handled with a physically present interpreter or will occur in \n- 61 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 62 of 92\n   \nphysical locations not equipped for VRI. These interactions must be \nanalyzed to determine the number of hours for which a physically \npresent interpreter is scheduled. \nA number of state DOCs have installed and make use of VRI \nincluding California, Oregon and Virginia. \nf)  I believe that FDOC must install visual alarms and signals in all \ncommon areas (e.g. visiting areas, medical areas, employment areas, \nclassroom areas, library areas) and, if not in the cell/room of each \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmate, at least in a location that is \nclearly visible from all parts of the cell/room. \nIV.  Conclusions With Respect To Treatment Of D/Deaf Or Hard Of Hearing Inmates in \nFDOC Facilities.   \nDirect communicative interaction: \n•  The fact that a d/Deaf or hard of hearing person uses his/her speech in certain \nrestricted interactions cannot be taken as an indication that that person does not \nrequire the services of  an ASL/English interpreter in order to have effective \ncommunication.  \n•  The fact that a d/Deaf or hard of hearing person is able to lip-read in certain \nrestricted interactions cannot be taken as an indication that that person does not \nrequire the  services of  an ASL/English interpreter in order to have effective \ncommunication.  \n•  Reliance upon verbal commands, announcements and signals is an inefficient and \nineffective means of communicating with many d/Deaf or hard of hearing inmates. \n•  Reliance upon announcements made over a PA system to signal all moves and \nprovide other information is not an effective way to communicate with d/Deaf and \nhard of hearing inmates. \n- 62 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 63 of 92\n   \n•  Provision of a visual alarms/alert notification system (e.g. lighted message board) \nis necessary to ensure effective and efficient communication with d/Deaf and hard \nof hearing inmates. \nTelephonic access: \n•  Provision of TTYs where d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates have a level of \nliteracy sufficient to use the TTY effectively. \n•  Provision of CapTel functionality is necessary to provide equivalent telephonic \nservices to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who have telephonically intelligible \nspeech and a level of literacy.  \n•  Provision of a Videophone and access to a Video Relay Service is necessary to \nprovide equivalent telephonic services to d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates unable \nto use CapTel.  \nProvision of interpreting services: \n•  Provision of qualified sign language interpreter services is the only way to provide \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with access and effective communication for \nthe same educational, training and self-improvement programs available to inmates \nwho are not d/Deaf or hard of hearing. \n•  Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) is the best way to provide d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates with effective and equivalent access to “an interpreter who is able \nto  interpret  effectively,  accurately  and  impartially  both  receptively  and \nexpressively,  using  any  necessary  specialized  vocabulary”  in  high  stakes, \n“emergency” situations.  \n•  VRI equipment in the nurse’s office, warden’s office and other key locations in \neach FDOC facility that houses d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates, may be the \nonly way for FDOC to provide effective communication in emergency, “high \nstakes” situations.  \n•  VRI  should  only  be  used  in  “last  minute/emergency”  situations  in  which  an \ninterpreter is needed. VRI should not be viewed as a replacement for physically \npresent interpreters at most scheduled high stakes and “public” situations. \nFDOC personnel training: \n•  A mandatory information, orientation and education program for FDOC personnel \nwho are responsible for, or have need to interact with d/Deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates is necessary to address any stereotypes and audist biases and to promote \nthe level of understanding of issues and needs of d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates \nthat will ensure nondiscrimination. \n- 63 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 64 of 92\n   \nFDOC policies and procedures: \n•  A review of all FDOC policies and procedures, with appropriate modifications \nwhere warranted, is necessary to ensure that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are \nnot systematically disadvantaged relative to inmates who are no d/Deaf or hard of \nhearing. \n•  The FDOC needs a policy and practice of reviewing all d/Deaf or hard of hearing \ninmates at intake at the Reception Centers to determine their communication needs. \nThe process of making such a determination must include each d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing inmate in determining what is needed for effective communication for each \ninmate. FDOC must ensure they are properly tested (not just hearing tests) and \nappropriately coded in the system. This coding will indicate the interpreter services \nneeded for appointments, disciplinary hearings, work opportunities, programs, and \nreligious services. When such appointments, hearings, etc. are held FDOC should \narrange for interpreting services. It should not be the responsibility of the inmate to \nmake requests for interpreting services. The policy and practice should be reviewed \nat  least  yearly  because  communication  needs  change.  If  an  inmate  changes \nfacilities,  that  inmate’s  communication/access  profile  should  follow  –  it  is \nimportant to remember that, in general, an inmate’s communication needs do not \nchange only how a specific facility will meet those needs. \nConsolidation of FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates: \n•  Consolidate FDOC d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates in 3-5 facilities located in \nlarge metropolitan areas to increase access to qualified, credentialed interpreters. \nV.  Summary \nMembers of the American Deaf Community are a linguistic and cultural minority. The \nlanguage that binds them together and is the critical determinant for membership in the Community \nis  American  Sign  Language.  Many  people  who  are  not  deaf  have  stereotypical  and  audist \nmisconceptions about Deaf people and American Sign Language. They believe that d/Deaf people \ncan lip-read with a degree of accuracy that will enable meaningful communication, when in reality \nthe level of accuracy for most d/Deaf people is 30% at best. Those who are not deaf believe that \nDeaf people can read and write English fluently when in reality the average Deaf person reads at \napproximately a fourth grade reading level. Those who are not deaf fail to understand that in order \n- 64 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 65 of 92\n   \nfor communication with d/Deaf inmates to be effective and efficient it must be visually clear and \nunambiguous. \nFDOC has not installed visual alarms or signals that provide meaningful access for d/Deaf \nand hard of hearing inmates. Light boards that would display specific inmate “moves” or “calls” \n(e.g. counts, chow) would provide d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates with the same access to \ninformation provided to non-deaf inmates by hearing PA announcements. Alternately, there are \npage alert systems, if appropriately  and reliably implemented, might provide an acceptable \nalternative. \nFor meaningful, high stakes interactions, communicative access for d/Deaf and hard of \nhearing  inmates  must  be  provided  by  employing  the  services  of  a  qualified  sign  language \ninterpreter. In addition to physically present interpreters, technology has made it possible to use \nthe services of Video Relay Services (VRS) or a Video Remote Interpreter (VRI), when it is \nimpractical to have a physically present interpreter. VRI provides the only meaningful way to \nensure accurate and effective communication in “last minute” emergency situations. \nThe  only  way  to  provide  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  who  do  not  have \ntelephonically intelligible speech and a level of literacy with telephone services and benefits \nequivalent to those afforded non-deaf inmates is the provision of a Videophone and access to Video \nRelay Services.  \nThe only way to provide d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates who have telephonically intelligible \nspeech and a level of literacy with telephone services and benefits equivalent to those afforded \nnon-deaf inmates is the provision of TTY or CapTel telephone services.  \n- 65 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 66 of 92\n   \nBased on my 48 years’ experience with the Deaf Community and my review of the record, \nI  believe  that  FDOC  has  denied  d/Deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  inmates  access  to  effective \ncommunication. Based on my experience, I believe that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates housed \nin FDOC facilities are the victims of audism. \nI believe that FDOC must regularly review all of its policies and procedures and revise \nthem where necessary to ensure that d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates are not systematically \noppressed and discriminated against d/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates. \nLack of information about Deaf people, their language and their culture on the part of \nFDOC employees appears to play a major role in their decisions to deny or restrict access for \nd/Deaf and hard of hearing inmates to programs and services available to non-deaf inmates. One \nway to address lack of information and ignorance about Deaf people, their language and their \nculture is to implement regular awareness-training programs. Among other topics, these training \nprograms should address the stereotypes and biases about d/Deaf and hard of hearing people \ndiscussed above (e.g. levels of literacy and lip-reading) and the need for visual access. \nThis opinion is based on the materials I have reviewed thus far. I reserve the right to supplement \nthis Declaration should new material become available to me. \nI understand that a false statement in this Declaration will subject me to penalties for \nperjury. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \n/s/ Dennis Cokely \nDennis Cokely \nDate:  January 27, 2017 \n \n   \n- 66 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62-7   Filed 01/30/17   Page 67 of 92\n   \nVI.

The United States files this action against Julie Jones in her capacity as \nSecretary of the Florida Department of Corrections (“FDOC”) to enforce Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (“Title II” and “ADA”), \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n(“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794; and their implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R \nParts 35 and 42. \n2.  From approximately 2009 to the present, FDOC has repeatedly failed to \nprovide effective communication for inmates with disabilities.  FDOC has also \nfailed to provide to inmates with disabilities the benefits of the programs, services, \nand activities that FDOC provides to inmates without disabilities.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a, and 42 U.S.C. § 12133. \n4.  This Court has the authority to grant the relief sought pursuant to 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n5.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 \nbecause a substantial portion of the events or omissions giving rise to this cause of \naction took place within this district, and it is proper in this Division because the \nheadquarters of FDOC is located in Tallahassee, Florida. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 3 of 12\nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff-Intervenor is the United States of America.  The United States \nDepartment of Justice is the agency with primary regulatory and enforcement \nresponsibilities under Title II of the ADA and under Section 504.  As such, the \nDepartment plays a unique role in enforcing and interpreting these statutes and \ntheir implementing regulation on behalf of the broad public interest.  The United \nStates’ prominent enforcement role is reflected in the statutory authorization given \nthe Attorney General to commence a legal action when discrimination prohibited \nby the ADA or Section 504 takes place.  42 U.S.C. § 12133; 29 U.S.C. § 794a. \n7.  Defendant Julie Jones is the current Secretary and chief executive officer \nof FDOC.  FDOC is the agency of the State of Florida that operates state prisons.  \nIt is headquartered in Tallahassee, in the Northern District of Florida.  FDOC is a \npublic entity under 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1), and thus is subject to Title II of the \nADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and the implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part \n35.  FDOC receives federal funding from the Department, and thus is subject to \nSection 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 42. \nFACTS \n  8.  FDOC systemically violates the rights of inmates with disabilities under \nTitle II of the ADA and under Section 504.  Systemic violations include but are not \nlimited to the following: \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 4 of 12\na.  Failure to provide assistive devices:  FDOC routinely fails to provide \ninmates with the auxiliary aids and services they require to perform \nroutine activities in a prison environment.  For instance, FDOC routinely \nfails to provide hearing aids and similar devices to inmates who need and \nrequest them, depriving those inmates of even a limited ability to hear for \nmonths or even years at a time. \nb.  Failure to provide interpreters:  FDOC also routinely fails to provide \nqualified interpreters to inmates with hearing disabilities who require \ninterpreters to communicate effectively, despite FDOC policy requiring \nthe provision of interpreters in some circumstances (e.g., for extended \nmedical events).   \nc.  Failure to provide teletypewriters or videophones:  FDOC fails to \nprovide effective communication devices for inmates with hearing \ndisabilities to contact legal counsel, family, and friends, unlike inmates \nwithout disabilities who may use telephones.  Some FDOC facilities have \nteletypewriters (TTY), an increasingly outdated form of communication \nthat allows inmates to communicate with outside parties through words \nkeyed into a device that sends and receives typewritten messages.  But \neven when TTY devices are present, they are frequently broken, in \nlocations that inmates cannot access, out of paper, restricted to a degree \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 5 of 12\nthat ordinary telephones are not, and unable to contact significant \ntelephone numbers, such as the Florida abuse hotline.  \nd.  Exclusion from programs, activities, or services:  FDOC prohibits \notherwise qualified inmates with disabilities from participating in \nprograms, services, or activities, such as job programs, because of their \ndisabilities.   \n9.  As an example of the violations outlined above, an FDOC inmate with a \nhearing disability sought to have FDOC issue him two working hearing aids in \n2009.  The inmate did not receive two working hearing aids from FDOC until \n2014.  In the interim, FDOC alternately ignored his requests, dismissed his claims \nthat he had turned in non-functioning hearing aids to FDOC, and lost track of the \nlocation of his hearing aids in the system.  One month after he finally obtained two \nhearing aids in 2014, one of them broke.  The inmate submitted it to FDOC for \nrepair; FDOC returned it to him a month later, still broken. \n10.  As further example, although FDOC policy requires inmates with \nhearing disabilities to have access to an American Sign Language (ASL) \ninterpreter for medical appointments, FDOC has failed to provide an inmate with a \nhearing disability an ASL interpreter for any medical, dental, psychological, or \nclassification event in over fifteen years of his incarceration.  Because this inmate  \nhas limited literacy in English, written communication with him is frequently \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 6 of 12\nineffective.  On one occasion in 2012, FDOC medical staff members gave this \ninmate incorrect medicine due to their inability to effectively communicate with \nhim, and did not detect the error for nearly a week.      \n11.  As further example, a third inmate also has a hearing disability.  This \ninmate has filed numerous grievances from 2013 to the present concerning his \ninability to contact his family through the TTY devices that FDOC provides to \ninmates.  FDOC took no action to rectify the situation, and did not consider the use \nof videophones as an alternative means of communication.  FDOC has also failed \nto provide this inmate with two functioning hearing aids for over thirteen years, \ndespite numerous efforts on his part to obtain them.   \n12.  As further example, two additional inmates with hearing disabilities \nsought paying work positions with FDOC in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  FDOC \ndeclined to consider them for any jobs because they are deaf. \nVIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE ADA \n(42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134; 28 C.F.R Part 35) \n13.  The allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated \nby reference. \n14.  FDOC has, by reason of disability, excluded qualified individuals from \nparticipation in, and denied them the benefits of, the services, programs, and \nactivities FDOC provides to inmates without disabilities, or otherwise \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 7 of 12\ndiscriminated against them, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. Part \n35. \n15.  FDOC has denied effective communication to inmates with disabilities, \nincluding through its failure to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.160. \n16.  FDOC acted intentionally and with deliberate indifference and knew or \nshould have known that it had not provided the benefit of its services, programs, \nand activities to inmates with disabilities, and that it failed to provide effective \ncommunication to inmates with disabilities.   \n17.  As a result of FDOC’s discrimination, qualified individuals with \ndisabilities have suffered injuries including humiliation, frustration, and distress. \n18.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendant will continue to engage in \nthe conduct and practices set forth in paragraph 8 that deprive FDOC inmates with \ndisabilities of their ADA rights and will continue to cause harm to those inmates. \nVIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n(29 U.S.C. § 794; 28 C.F.R. Part 42) \n19.  The allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated \nby reference. \n20.  FDOC is a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. \n21.  FDOC has, by reason of disability, excluded qualified individuals from \nparticipation in, and denied them the benefits of, the programs and activities FDOC \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 8 of 12\nprovides to inmates without disabilities, or otherwise discriminated against them, \nin violation of 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. Part 42. \n22.  FDOC has failed to insure that communications with inmates with \ndisabilities are effectively conveyed, including through its failure to provide \nappropriate auxiliary aids, in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. \n§ 42.503(e), (f). \n23.  FDOC acted intentionally and with deliberate indifference and knew or \nshould have known that it had not provided the benefit of its programs and \nactivities to inmates with disabilities, and that it failed to insure that \ncommunications with inmates with disabilities were effectively conveyed.   \n24.  As a result of FDOC’s discrimination, qualified individuals with \ndisabilities have suffered injuries including humiliation, frustration, and distress. \n25.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendant will continue to engage in \nthe conduct and practices set forth in paragraph 8 that deprive FDOC inmates with \ndisabilities of their rights under Section 504 and will continue to cause harm to \nthose inmates. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that the Court: \n(1)  Grant judgment in favor of the United States and declare that FDOC \nviolated Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, Section 504, \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 9 of 12\n29 U.S.C. § 794, and their implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R. \nParts 35 and 42. \n(2)  Enjoin FDOC, its officers, agents, employees, and all other persons \nand entities in active concert and participation with it from denying \nindividuals with disabilities equal participation in and equal \nopportunity to benefit from its services, programs, and activities, or \notherwise subjecting individuals with disabilities to discrimination. \n(3)  Enjoin FDOC, its officers, agents, employees, and all other persons \nand entities in active concert and participation with it from failing to \nprovide effective communication to inmates with disabilities. \n(4)  Order FDOC to provide training to its employees regarding the \nobligations of Title II, Section 504, and their implementing \nregulations. \n(5)  Order FDOC to take such affirmative steps as may be necessary to \nrestore, as nearly as practicable, each identifiable person aggrieved \nand harmed by FDOC’s discriminatory conduct to the position that he \nor she would have been in but for FDOC conduct. \n(6)  Order compensatory damages, including damages for pain and \nsuffering, in an appropriate amount for injuries suffered as a result of \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 10 of 12\nFDOC’s failure to comply with the requirements of Title II of the \nADA and with Section 504. \n(7)  Order such other appropriate relief as the interests of justice may \nrequire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 53-1   Filed 01/09/17   Page 11 of 12\nDated:  January 9, 2017   \n   \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nCHRISTOPHER CANOVA  LORETTA E.

While this case is large and complex, \nthere are numerous issues for which a sufficient record has been adduced to conclude, as a matter \nof law, that the FDOC has been violating these laws, and that an injunction is necessary to ensure \nfuture compliance.   Ruling on these issues will enable the parties to craft a remedial plan.  \nTherefore,  Plaintiff  Disability  Rights  Florida  (DRF)  respectfully  requests  that  summary \njudgment be entered in its favor on the issues outlined below.  \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 2 of 51\nBackground  \n \nPlaintiff Disability Rights Florida \n \n Congress has created a nationwide Protection and Advocacy (P&A) System to protect \nthe legal and human rights of people with disabilities. See 29 U.S.C. § 794e.  Each state has a \ndesignated P&A organization; Plaintiff Disability Rights Florida (DRF) serves as the P&A for \nthe state of Florida.  See Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program v. SafetyNet Youthcare, Inc., \n65 F. Supp. 3d 1312, 1321 (S.D. Ala. 2014) (describing the P&A system). DRF has authority to \npursue  legal,  administrative,  and  other  appropriate  remedies  or  approaches  to  ensure  the \nprotection of, and advocacy for, the rights of people with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(3); 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i)f.  See Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879, 884 (11th Cir. 1999) (describing \nthe standing of DRF’s predecessor organization).    \nThe Mistreatment of Incarcerated People with Disabilities  \n  The  number  of  incarcerated  people  with  disabilities  nationwide  is  staggering.    The \nBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimates that approximately 30% of prisoners have some kind \nof disability (including cognitive disabilities)—more than three times the rate in the general \npopulation.1  The BJS found that 7% of prisoners reported a vision disability versus 2.1% in the \ngeneral population, 6.2% reported a hearing disability versus 2.6% in the general population, and \n10.1% reported an ambulatory disability versus 5.1% in the general population.   Id. at 3.  The \nnumbers are similar in Florida: The FDOC has identified 2,323 prisoners with physical (367 who \nare deaf or hard of hearing, 327 who are blind or have low vision, 1,707 who have mobility \n                                                 \n1  BUREAU  OF  JUSTICE  STATISTICS,  Disabilities  Among  Prison  and  Jail  Inmates,  2011-12, \nDecember 2015, at 1 (Exhibit 1).  Available at https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dpji1112.pdf \n(“BJS Report”).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 3 of 51\nimpairments, and 636 who use wheelchairs).2  FDOC Impairment Rating Spreadsheet, Ex. 2.   \nUnsurprisingly, prisoners with disabilities are more likely than non-disabled prisoners to \nexperience serious psychological distress.  BJS Report at 6.  They are also subject to more abuse \nby guards and other prisoners.3  See also United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 161–62 (2006) \n(Stevens, J., concurring) (describing evidence in Congressional record detailing the mistreatment \nof prisoners with disabilities).  Despite these numbers, there is still widespread noncompliance \nwith disability laws in prisons and jails across the country, and Florida is no different.4   \n  Finally, as this Court is aware, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)—the \nfederal agency responsible for enforcing the ADA and RA—is seeking to intervene in this case \nbecause it has similarly concluded that the FDOC has failed to comply with these laws.  See D.E. \n53.  This action is the culmination of a years-long effort by the DOJ to assess the FDOC’s \n                                                 \n2 Because prisoners may have multiple disabilities, there is overlap in these numbers.  Also, as \ndemonstrated below in the section on failure to identify prisoners with disabilities, these numbers \nare almost certainly too low. \n   \n3 See Ridgeway, James & Casella, Jean, Deaf Prisoners in Florida Face Abuse and Solitary \nConfinement,  SOLITARY  WATCH,  May  21,  2013,  available  at \nhttp://solitarywatch.com/2013/05/21/deaf-prisoners-in-florida-face-brutality-and-solitary-\nconfinement/. \n  \n4 See, e.g., Erika Eichelberger, Punished Twice: Prisons basically ignore the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, leaving a third of inmates facing abuse and neglect, VICE NEWS, December 28, \n2016,  available  at    https://news.vice.com/story/prisons-basically-ignore-the-americans-with-\ndisabilities-act; AMPLIFYING VOICES OF INMATES WITH DISABILITIES (AVID), Making Hard Time \nHarder: Programmatic Accommodations for Inmates with Disabilities Under the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act, June 22, 2016 (Exhibit 3) available at http://avidprisonproject.org/Making-\nHard-Time-Harder/assets/making-hard-time-harder---pdf-version.pdf;  CENTER  FOR  AMERICAN \nPROGRESS,  Disabled  Behind  Bars:  The  Mass  Incarceration  of  People  with  Disabilities  in \nAmerica’s  Jails  and  Prisons,  July  2016  (Exhibit  4)  available  at \nhttps://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/18000151/2CriminalJusticeDisability-report.pdf;  AMERICAN  CIVIL \nLIBERTIES  UNION,  Caged  In:  Solitary  Confinement’s  Devastating  Harm  on  Prisoners  with \nPhysical  Disabilities,  January  2017,  at  12  (Exhibit  5)  available  at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/010916-aclu-solitarydisabilityreport-\nsingle.pdf (“ACLU Report”).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 4 of 51\ncompliance, despite the FDOC’s steadfast refusal to permit the DOJ to conduct a compliance \nreview.    See  DOJ-FDOC  Letters,  Ex.  6.    Over  three  years  later,  the  DOJ  announced  its \nconclusion that it had “determined that FDOC has violated and continues to violate Title II [of \nthe ADA] and Section 504 [of the RA].”  Id.  \nLegal Framework \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA) contain \nbroad commands requiring all public entities to ensure that their operations are meaningfully \naccessible to all persons with disabilities.  See Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th \nCir. 2011) (en banc; citations omitted) (“The ADA is a ‘broad mandate’ of ‘comprehensive \ncharacter’  and  ‘sweeping  purpose’  intended  ‘to  eliminate  discrimination  against  disabled \nindividuals, and to integrate them into the economic and social mainstream of American life.’”).  \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Similarly, the RA provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance.”  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  “With the exception of its federal funding requirement, the RA \nuses the same standards as the ADA, and therefore, cases interpreting either are applicable and \ninterchangeable.”  Badillo v. Thorpe, 158 F. App’x 208, 214 (11th Cir. 2005).5   \nWhile the ADA does not explicitly define “services, programs, or activities,” the RA, \n                                                 \n5 The FDOC receives federal financial assistance.  See Answer, D.E. 37, ¶ 8.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 5 of 51\nwhich must be “interpreted in pari materia with the ADA, defines a ‘program or activity’ as ‘all \nof the operations of ... a local government.’”  Frame, 657 F.3d at 225 (citing 29 U.S.C. § \n794(b)(1)(A)).  Indeed,  “the  phrase  ‘services,  programs,  or  activities’  encompasses  virtually \neverything a public entity does.”  Anderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 356 (6th Cir. \n2015)  (citation  omitted).    And  even  if  that were  not  clear,  the  final  clause  of  the  ADA’s \nantidiscrimination provision is not tied to any service, program, or activity, but rather “is a catch-\nall phrase that prohibits all discrimination by a public entity, regardless of the context.”  Bledsoe \nv. Palm Beach Cty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist., 133 F.3d 816, 822 (11th Cir. 1998) \n(citation omitted).  Thus, everything a public entity does—including the operations of its prisons, \nPennsylvania Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998)—must be done in a way that is \naccessible to persons with disabilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(1) (“Public entities shall \nensure  that  qualified  inmates  or  detainees  with  disabilities  shall  not,  because  a  facility  is \ninaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or \nbe denied the benefits of, the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected \nto discrimination by any public entity.”).   \nMoreover,  the  DOJ  has  promulgated  regulations  which  give  effect  to  these  broad \nprovisions by imposing more specific obligations.  See 28 C.F.R. parts 35 and 42, et seq.  \n“Because Congress explicitly authorized the Attorney General to promulgate regulations under \nthe ADA, see 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a), the regulations ‘must [be given] legislative and hence \ncontrolling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or plainly contrary to the statute.’”  Shotz \nv. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, \n834 (1984)).  The DOJ has also issued a Technical Assistance Manual (TAM) and Appendices to \nthe regulations, which further elaborate on the meaning of the regulations.  “Like the ADA \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 6 of 51\nregulations, the agency’s interpretations in the TAM are given controlling weight unless they are \narbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.”  Schwarz v. The Villages Charter \nSch., Inc., 165 F. Supp. 3d 1153, 1182 (M.D. Fla. 2016) (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, \n646 (1998)).  \nThe regulations confirm that the access provided to persons with disabilities must be both \nmeaningful and equal to that received by non-disabled persons.  Indeed, “[a] violation of Title II \n. . . does not occur only when a disabled person is completely prevented from enjoying a service, \nprogram, or activity. The regulations specifically require that services, programs, and activities \nbe ‘readily accessible.’”  Shotz, 256 F.3d at 1080 (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.150).  This means public \nentities must ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided the same opportunities and the \nsame benefits, with the ability to achieve the same results, as non-disabled individuals.  See 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1).  \nTo  ensure  equal  and  meaningful  access,  public  entities  must  also  make  reasonable \nmodifications6 in policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability,  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(7),  furnish  appropriate  auxiliary  aids  and  services  where \nnecessary to ensure equal participation and benefits, 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(1), and give primary \nconsideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities in determining what auxiliary aids \nand services are necessary. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).   \nIn sum, the ADA and RA prohibit not only “traditional” forms of discrimination, but also \nthe lack of access caused by “thoughtlessness and indifference.”   Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. \n287, 295 (1985).  To combat this, “[i]n addition to their respective prohibitions of disability-\n                                                 \n6 “Title II’s use of the term ‘reasonable modifications’ is essentially equivalent to Title I's use of \nthe term ‘reasonable accommodation.’” Robertson v. Las Animas County Sheriff’s Dep’t., 500 \nF.3d 1185, 1195 n. 8 (10th Cir. 2007). \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 7 of 51\nbased discrimination, both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act impose upon public entities an \naffirmative obligation to make reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals. Where a \ndefendant  fails  to  meet  this  affirmative  obligation,  the  cause  of  that  failure  is  irrelevant.”  \nBennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, 454–55 (5th Cir. 2005) (emphasis \nadded).  See also Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 910 (6th Cir. \n2004) (“Title II imposes affirmative obligations on public entities and does not merely require \nthem to refrain from intentionally discriminating against the disabled.”).   \n* * * \n  Plaintiff’s argument is divided into four sections:  three corresponding to the types of \ndisabilities that at are issue in this case (deaf/hard of hearing, mobility, and blind/low vision) and \na fourth on issues that are applicable to all disabilities.  Although the bulk of Plaintiff’s claims \nare based on the ADA and RA, Plaintiff will indicate where an Eighth Amendment or Due \nProcess claim is being made as well.   \nVIOLATIONS REGARDING PRISONERS WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF \nHEARING \n \n  Deaf individuals are a linguistic and cultural minority that has been, and continues to be, \ncommunicatively disadvantaged by the hearing and speaking majority.  Cokely Report (Exhibit \n7) at 4.  The vast majority do not attain competence in written or spoken English.  Contrary to \npopular belief, most deaf individuals cannot lip-read English, and for those that can, the method \nis ineffective because only a small percentage of information can be communicated through lip-\nreading.    Id.    Neither  lip-reading  nor  written  communication  is  a  substitute  for  effective \ncommunication.  Id. at 4 & 35.     \nRather, American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary method by which deaf individuals \ncommunicate.  Id. at 12.  ASL is its own language, with its own grammar and syntax.  It is not a \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 8 of 51\nword-for-word translation of any spoken language (including English).  Id.  For those who use it, \nASL  is  the  only  means  of  communication  that  enables  effective,  efficient,  and  reliable \ncommunication.  Id. at 10.   \n  Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Dennis Cokely—a nationally renowned expert on deaf language \nand culture—conducted extensive site reviews of ten FDOC prisons and interviewed 30 deaf and \nhard-of-hearing prisoners. He has concluded that the FDOC denies deaf and hard of hearing \ninmates effective communication and access to the services and technology that make effective \ncommunication  possible,  that  the  FDOC  has  restricted  access  to  services,  programs,  and \ncommunication, and that these problems are widespread throughout the FDOC.  Id. at 5.   \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Qualified Interpreters During Critical Events \n  In addition to the broad command of making all operations meaningfully and equally \naccessible  to  persons  with  disabilities,  the  ADA  and  RA  regulations  contain  specific \nrequirements of ensuring that communications are effectively conveyed.  See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. §§ \n35.160(a)(1); 42.502(e).  As relevant here, “[a] public entity shall furnish appropriate auxiliary \naids and services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities, including applicants, \nparticipants, companions, and members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and \nenjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of a public entity.”  28 C.F.R. §35.160(b)(1).  \nSee also 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(f).  “The term ‘auxiliary aids and services’ includes—(A) qualified \ninterpreters  or  other  effective  methods  of  making  aurally  delivered  materials  available  to \nindividuals with hearing impairments . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 12103(1); 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.     \n  FDOC prisoners regularly encounter critical situations where interpreters are necessary to \nensure effective, meaningful, and equal access.  They include medical appointments, mental \nhealth appointments, meetings with classification officers, education programs, substance abuse \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 9 of 51\nprograms,  intake  and  orientation,  disciplinary  hearings,  religious  services,  and  any  other \nimportant presentation such as those required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).  A \nperson who is deaf or hard of hearing will, at best, not receive equal and meaningful access to \nthese interactions, and at worst, be completely excluded from them.  Indeed, “[t]he clear reality \nis that the only practical way for Deaf people and for many deaf people to participate effectively \nin  these  types  of  ‘high  stakes’  one-to-one  interactions,  and  in  any  small  or  large  group \ninteraction, is to employ the services of a qualified sign language interpreter.”  Cokely Report at \n24.  The ADA and RA therefore the FDOC to provide qualified interpreters at these critical \ninteractions.  See Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 275 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(granting summary judgment for plaintiff and holding that failure to provide sign language \ninterpreter at various prison interactions violated ADA and RA); Clarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F. \nSupp. 1019, 1046 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (failure to provide ASL interpreters at classification and \nreception violates ADA and RA); Chisolm v. McManimon, 275 F.3d 315, 329 (3d Cir. 2001) \n(acknowledging that correctional facility may have to provide ASL interpreters at critical points, \nincluding intake, medical evaluations, and classification).     \n  But the FDOC systemically fails to do this.  Numerous FDOC prisoners are consistently \nforced to attend these events without interpreters being provided.  See Cokely Report at 39.   For \ninstance, in November 2016,   had an important legal call with his criminal appeal \nattorney  cancelled  because  no  interpreter  was  provided,  even  though  he  requested  one  in \nadvance.    Dec. ¶ 11 (Ex. 8).  Similarly, after   was sexually assaulted, \nstaff wrote in his file, “came to cell door but unable to communicate due to being deaf and \nmute.”    Dec. ¶ 4 (Ex. 9).  These are not isolated incidents.  See   Dec. ¶¶ 4 & 8 - \n11 (medical and mental health appointments, programs and legal calls);   Dec. ¶¶ \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 10 of 51\n3 - 5 (Ex. 10) (processing, medical, mental health, classification, religious, fatherhood classes, \nGED);   Dec. ¶¶ 4-9, 11-13, & 18 (Ex. 11) (never received an ASL interpreter \nduring her entire incarceration, specifically lacking at church, mental health, RTC drug program, \nmedical, rape prevention);   Dec. ¶¶ 3-5 & 8 (Ex. 12) (medical, classification, mental \nhealth, church, education, Horizon program);   Dec. ¶¶ 5 - 6 & 24 (Ex. 13) (no \noral interpreter for all programs, medical, classification, dental, mental health, investigations); \n Dec. ¶ 5 (Ex. 14) (medical and mental health);   Dec. ¶¶ 4-7 (Ex. \n15) (medical, dental, psychological, classification, church, training);   Dec. ¶¶ 7 \n- 9 & 14) (Ex. 16) (mental health, meetings with Securus to obtain telephone access);   \n Dec. ¶¶ 19-20 (Ex. 17) (no oral interpreter for church, meetings, medical);   \nDec. ¶¶ 3 - 6 (medical, disciplinary hearing, mental health, reporting crime);   \ndocs at 52457 (Ex. 18) (denied interpreter for medical appointments);   docs at \n5446 (Ex. 19) (no interpreter at medical appointment);   docs at 16422 & \n16409  (Ex.  20)  (no  interpreter  at  orientation  for  psychiatric  and  psychological  emergency \nprocedure, school, or church);   docs at 13424, 13194-96 (Ex. 21) (no interpreter \nat  mental  health  screening,  health  care,  mental  health,  dental,  church  and  other  meetings); \n docs at 95488, 95527-95540 (Ex. 22) (disciplinary hearing), 95543, 95548, \n96033(request for sign language interpreter to help with school work denied, DR resulted).   \n  Moreover, there have been numerous instances where the FDOC’s failure to provide an \ninterpreter required the postponement of a critical event.  See, e.g.,   Dec. ¶¶ 7 - \n9  (mental  health  evaluation  delayed  for  several  days,  then  proceeded  without  interpreter); \n docs at 5245 (delay for nearly a month);   Dec. ¶11 (legal calls \nrepeatedly canceled).   Even if those appointments were able to be rescheduled, this pattern of \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 11 of 51\nfailures still violates the ADA, because “auxiliary aids and services must be provided . . . in a \ntimely manner.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).  Forcing deaf and hard-of-hearing prisoners to wait \nweeks or months longer for medical and other appointments is not equal and meaningful access.  \nThe FDOC’s obligation is to be proactive to ensure accessibility on the front end, not simply to \nrespond  to  grievances  or  Reasonable  Modification  or  Accommodation  Requests  (RMARs), \nwhich takes months to resolve.7  \nEven if FDOC staff believe that an interpreter is not required for a particular interaction, \nthe ADA and RA do not permit them to simply make that decision unilaterally.  Rather, in \ndetermining the type of auxiliary aid or service is necessary, “a public entity shall give primary \nconsideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).  This \nmeans that “[t]he public entity must provide an opportunity for individuals with disabilities to \nrequest the auxiliary aids and services of their choice,” and that “[t]he public entity shall honor \nthe choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective means of communication exists or that \nuse of the means chosen would not be required under §35.164.”   28 C.F.R. part 35, app. A \n(emphasis added).  See also Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1082 (11th Cir. 2007) \n(“Further, the Appendix to DOJ Regulation § 35.160 states that ‘[t]he public entity shall honor \nthe [disabled individual’s] choice [of auxiliary aid] unless it can demonstrate another effective \nmeans of communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be required under § \n                                                 \n7 Proceeding through the grievance or RMAR system if often futile.  For instance, according to \none report, between January 2013 and January 2015, 792 grievances were filed by FDOC \nprisoners with disabilities, but only 44 were resolved during this time period.  See ACLU Report \nat 8.  And even when RMARs are granted, there are unnecessary delays.  See RMAR Documents \n(Ex. 23) 2801-2802 (request for headphones delayed 6 months); 2914-2916 (request for large \nprint delayed 5 months); 3066-3077 (request for headphones delayed 4 months); 3075-3077 \n(request for volume booster delayed 4 months); 3346-3348 (request for shower chair delayed 3 \nmonths); 3748-3751 (request for key lock delayed 4 months); 3854-3855 (request for interpreter \ndelayed 3 months); 4624-4631 (request for ASL interpreter delayed 4 ½ months).   \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 12 of 51\n35.164.’” (quoting 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A)).  Thus, the FDOC has an obligation to “consult \nwith the individual to determine the most appropriate auxiliary aid or service, because the \nindividual with a disability is most familiar with his or her disability and is in the best position to \ndetermine what type of aid or service will be effective.”  See TAM § II-7.1100.  \nThe failure to conduct this inquiry alone violates the ADA.  See Wright v. N.Y. State \nDep’t of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 77 (2d Cir. 2016) (failure to engage in individualized inquiry for \nprisoner with  mobility impairment violates ADA and  RA); Pierce, 128 F. Supp.3d at 254 \n(finding that state denied a deaf inmate “meaningful access to prison services” where prison \nemployees “did nothing to evaluate [plaintiff’s] need for accommodation” and did not “engage in \nany meaningful assessment of his needs”).  \nBut, as demonstrated above, the FDOC fails to engage in this process.  Rather, it simply \nissues denials based on the assessment of FDOC staff and medical personnel, which is an \ninadequate method of judging someone’s communication skills.  Cokely Report at 44 (explaining \nthat a valid assessment of communication skills cannot simply be a medical assessment of \nhearing level, it must include evaluation by someone versed in ASL or other communication \nmethods).  See also RMAR Documents at 4263-4266 (request for oral interpreter denied because \ninmate  has  hearing  aids);  4642-4647  (request  for  hearing  aids  and  vibrating  watch  denied \nbecause  does  not  meet  criteria);  3917-3919  (request  for  hearing  aids  denied  because  not \nmedically necessary).  \nAlthough the FDOC’s written policy allows for sign language interpreters in certain \ncircumstances, in practice they are almost never provided.  And the policy actually imposes a \nblanket denial of interpreters in certain situations, stating that “[i]nterpreter services will not \nnormally be required for the following: aa. Regular sick call, or bb. Job assignment.”   FDOC \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 13 of 51\nProcedure 604.101, Ex. 24 at 1696.  A “regular sick call” appointment is when a prisoner first \nsees medical staff to describe what he or she is experiencing.  This will likely entail describing \nsymptoms, providing a history, and answering other questions the nurse may have—in short, one \nof the most important appointments in the prisoner’s course of treatment.  There is no way a deaf \nperson  could  meaningfully  communicate  these  matters  in  a  bi-directional  way  without  an \ninterpreter, and the FDOC’s blanket refusal to provide one violates the ADA and RA.  See 28 \nC.F.R. part 35, app. A (“[A]n individual who is deaf or hard of hearing may need a qualified \ninterpreter to communicate with municipal hospital personnel about diagnoses, procedures, tests, \ntreatment options, surgery, or prescribed medication (e.g., dosage, side effects, drug interactions, \netc.), or to explain follow-up treatments, therapies, test results, or recovery.”).  \nThe written policy is also insufficient because it places the responsibility of requesting a \nsign language interpreter with the disabled individual, when it is the FDOC’s obligation to \nproactively ensure that interpreters are provided.  See Ex. 24 at 1695.  As explained above, the \nADA  and  RA  prohibit  more  than  just  intentional  discrimination;  they  impose  affirmative \nobligations on public entities to ensure equal and meaningful access.  See Bennett-Nelson, 431 \nF.3d at 454–55.  “Where a defendant fails to meet this affirmative obligation, the cause of that \nfailure is irrelevant.”  Id.  See also Clemons v. Dart, 168 F. Supp. 3d 1060, 1068 (N.D. Ill. 2016) \n(“Title  II  of  the  ADA  requires  affirmative,  proactive  accommodations  necessary  to  ensure \nmeaningful access to public services and programs, not accommodation upon request.”); Pierce, \n128 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  And, the requirement of making the request sufficiently in advance \nresults  in  long  delays.    See  Wright,  831  F.3d  at  73–74  (requirement  that  prisoner  using \nwheelchair request a mobility “well in advance” violated ADA).    And, in many instances, the \nFDOC already knew that the prisoner was deaf, because they were identified as such in the \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 14 of 51\nFDOC’s electronic coding system, thus putting the burden on the FDOC to at least inquire as to \nwhat accommodation would be necessary.  Simply leaving the decision of whether to provide an \ninterpreter to the discretion of FDOC staff (and only allowing interpreters “on a case-by-case \nbasis”) violates the ADA.  Ex. 24 at 1695.  The FDOC must honor the disabled individual’s \nrequest unless it can convincingly demonstrate why it is unable to do so.  See 28 C.F.R. § \n35.160(b)(2) & app. A.  \nIndeed, the FDOC’s patchwork process clearly violates the ADA’s commands: \n[T]his Court holds that prison officials have an affirmative duty to assess the \npotential accommodation needs of inmates with known disabilities who are taken \ninto custody and to provide the accommodations that are necessary for those \ninmates to access the prison’s programs and services, without regard to whether \nor not the disabled individual has made a specific request for accommodation and \nwithout  relying  solely  on  the  assumptions  of  prison  officials  regarding  that \nindividual’s needs.  \n \nPierce, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  The FDOC policies and procedures are akin to those that were \nrejected in Pierce, and they should be declared unlawful here.  \nUsing Other Prisoners or FDOC Staff as “Interpreters” Does Not Satisfy the ADA and RA \nThe FDOC sometimes requires other prisoners or FDOC staff to serve as sign language \n“interpreters”  for  other  prisoners.    In  the  first  place,  this  contravenes  the  ADA  and  RA’s \ncommand that the burden of providing the interpreter falls with the public entity, not the disabled \nindividual.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(c) (prohibiting public entities from requiring individuals to \nbring others to interpret for them).  But more importantly, this practice does not satisfy the \nFDOC’s obligation to provide qualified interpreters.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12103(1); 28 C.F.R. § \n35.014.  A “qualified interpreter” is “an interpreter who, via a video remote interpreting (VRI) \nservice or an on-site appearance, is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both \nreceptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.014.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 15 of 51\nAs explained in the appendix to the regulations, this means the type and skill level of the \ninterpreter must be tailored to the characteristics and needs of the person with the disability and \nthe particular situation where the interpreter is needed.  “For example, in a medical setting, a sign \nlanguage interpreter must have the necessary skills to understand the grammar and syntax used \nby an ASL user (receptive skills) and the ability to interpret complicated medical information—\npresented by medical staff in English—back to that individual in ASL (expressive skills).”   28 \nC.F.R. pt. 35, app. A.  Moreover, “someone with only a rudimentary familiarity with sign \nlanguage or finger spelling is not qualified, nor is someone who is fluent in sign language but \nunable to translate spoken communication into ASL or to translate signed communication into \nspoken words.”   Id.  See also TAM § II-7.1200 (“Signing and interpreting are not the same \nthing.  Being able to sign does not mean that a person can process spoken communication into \nthe proper signs, nor does it mean that he or she possesses the proper skills to observe someone \nsigning  and  change  their  signed  or  fingerspelled  communication  into  spoken  words.  The \ninterpreter must be able to interpret both receptively and expressively.”).   \nCourts have recognized the requirement that interpreters be qualified in the prison setting.  \nSee Williams v. Hayman, 657 F. Supp. 2d 488, 500 (D.N.J. 2008) (unqualified sign language \ninterpreter for educational program in prison could be ADA violation); Clarkson v. Coughlin, \n145 F.R.D. 339, 341 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (“A qualified sign language interpreter is one who has \nobtained certification from the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf....”); DeLong v. \nBrumbaugh, 703 F.Supp. 399, 403 (W.D. Pa. 1989) (“[q]ualified interpreters are available from \nthe Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc.”); Pyles v. Kamka, 491 F. Supp. 204, 205 (D. Md. \n1980) (approving consent decree in which prison officials agreed that an interpreter shall be \ndeemed qualified if he or she is certified by an appropriate credentialing authority).   \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 16 of 51\nUsing other prisoners to “interpret” falls far short of these standards.  Cokely Report at \n41-42.  First, the FDOC has no process for assessing a prisoner’s proficiency in ASL, and even if \nit did, it has no way of then identifying those prisoners who may be qualified to interpret.8  Even \nif an inmate-interpreter were familiar with ASL, they certainly would not possess the necessary \nskills and vocabulary to interpret receptively and expressively in a specialized situation like a \nmedical appointment (which would require, of course, being able to hear, understand, and speak \nEnglish).  As both the regulations and Dr. Cokely make clear, there is a difference between \n“social signing” and interpreting.  Cokely Report at 41-42.  FDOC policy even prohibits the use \nof  inmate  and  staff  interpreters  in  most  situations,  thereby  recognizing  that  doing  so  is \ninadequate.  See Ex. 24 at 1696.  Yet the FDOC routinely fails to adhere to this policy. See \nCokely Report at 41;   Dec. ¶¶ 8 - 11;   Dec. ¶ 6 (was repeatedly \nforced to interpret for others);   Dec. ¶ 6;   Dec. ¶ 5;   \n Dec. ¶¶ 5-6 (FDOC employee used for DR hearing who could not sign or understand \nMr.  );   Dec. ¶¶ 5,7-8, & 18;   Dec. ¶ 8;   \ndocs at 5257-5258 (inmate interpreter did not want to interpret and advised that   was \nunable  to  write  and  could  only  read  a  little  bit;  medical  staff  nonetheless  proceeded  with \nappointment);   Dec. ¶ 5.     \n                                                 \n8 Procedure 403.011(15)(b)(1), (Exhibit 25) at 1685, specifies that the FDOC should complete \nevaluations of inmate assistants to assess their level of competency in ASL and documents the \nevaluation in writing.  Plaintiff requested all such evaluations and the FDOC objected.  See \nFDOC’s Response to Plaintiff’s Second Request for Production (Exhibit 26) #10: “Objection.   \nSee above.   This is overly burdensome.   Any such evaluations of competency would only be \nstored in the medical files of particular individuals who were former inmates, or present inmates \nwho received training as an impaired inmate assistant. There were many hundreds of these \nindividuals since January 1, 2013. Also, since the DOC does not have a database that would \nreflect any such evaluations for particular individuals, the medical files for all those who were \ntrained as impaired inmate assistants during a certain period of time would need to be separately \nsearched.” \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 17 of 51\n  Finally, “[i]n order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be provided . . . in \nsuch a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a disability.”  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).  Requiring other inmates or staff to interpret does not meet this standard.  \nPatients will be less candid with medical staff if other prisoners or FDOC staff are in the room, \nthus compromising the effectiveness of the medical appointment. Further, “[a] breach of this \n[medical]  privacy  right  is  especially  problematic  in  the  prison  setting  where  an  inmate’s \npossession of confidential information about another inmate can be used in threatening and \ndangerous ways.”  Clarkson, 898 F. Supp. at 1041.  See also Elaine Gardner, The Legal Rights \nof Inmates with Physical Disabilities, 14 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 175 (1994) (“The ADA \ndefinition of qualified interpreter should rule out, for the most part, the use of fellow inmates as \ninterpreters.”).   \nEighth Amendment.  The Eighth Amendment “does not allow a prisoner to be exposed to \nan objectively unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.” Brooks v. Warden, 800 \nF.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir. 2015) (quotations/citations omitted).  It also prohibits prison officials \nfrom being deliberately indifferent to prisoners’ serious medical needs.  Gilmore v. Hodges, 738 \nF.3d 266, 274-75 (11th Cir. 2013).   But the failure to provide interpreters in medical situations \ndoes both.  It presents the unreasonable risk that deaf prisoners will not be provided with the \nmedical care needed to prevent future damage to their health, and prison officials have known \nabout this lack of interpreters through numerous grievances but have failed to do anything to \ncorrect the problem, thereby exhibiting deliberate indifference.  Further, the isolation caused by \nthe lack of communication also “deprive[s] inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life’s \nnecessities’”  and  “are  violative  of  the  ‘contemporary  standard  of  decency’  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment demands.”  Brooks, 800 F.3d at 1303–04 (quotations omitted).  \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 18 of 51\n  Due Process.  The retention or loss of “good time” (or “gain time” as they are called in \nFlorida) credits affects the length of a prisoner’s sentence, and therefore creates a liberty interest \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, \n558 (1974).  Constitutionally adequate procedures are therefore required before gain time credits \nare revoked.   Id.; see also Answer, D.E. 37, ¶ 482.  Accordingly, the FDOC holds disciplinary \nhearings to determine whether prisoners are guilty of an infraction.  See F.A.C. 33-601.307.    \nHowever, sign language interpreters are not provided to deaf prisoners at these hearings.   \nSee   Dec. ¶ 7;   Dec. ¶ 7;   Dec. ¶ 14;   \n Dec. ¶¶ 4-6;   Dec. ¶¶ 19-20.  In October 2016,   was \ndenied  an  interpreter  at  a  DR  hearing,  and  was  also  handcuffed  behind  his  back,  making \ncommunication impossible.    Dec. ¶ 10.    had a similar experience.  \n  Dec.  ¶  14.    The  hearings  are  useless  if  the  deaf  prisoners  cannot  understand  the \nproceedings; it is therefore tantamount to providing no hearing at all, in violation of the Due \nProcess Clause.  See Bonner v. Arizona Dep’t of Corr., 714 F. Supp. 420, 425 (D. Ariz. 1989) \n(failure  to  provide  sign  language  interpreter  for  disciplinary  hearing  violates  due  process); \nClarkson, 898 F.

Cokely Report at 45. \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 19 of 51\nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Other Auxiliary Aids and Services to Deaf and Hard of \nHearing Prisoners \n \n  In addition to qualified interpreters, the FDOC must also provide other auxiliary aids and \nservices, including “(B) qualified readers, taped texts, or other effective methods of making \nvisually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments; (C) acquisition or \nmodification of equipment or devices; and (D) other similar services and actions.”  42 U.S.C. § \n12103(1).    The  regulations  specify  that  aids  and  services  can  include  telephone  handset \namplifiers; assistive listening devices; telephones compatible with hearing aids; closed caption \ndecoders; open and closed captioning, including real-time captioning; voice, text, and video-\nbased telecommunications products and systems, including text telephones (TTYs), videophones, \nand captioned telephones; and many others.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.   \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide and Maintain Hearing Aids \n  One of the most critical auxiliary aids needed by deaf and hard-of-hearing prisoners is a \nhearing aid.  An operable, properly fitted hearing aid allows a hard-of-hearing prisoner to safely \nnavigate throughout their environment, and allows them to have conversations, especially when \nthere is loud ambient noise (a common occurrence in prison).  But the FDOC often fails to \nprovide this much-needed device, and when it is provided, the FDOC fails to make timely repairs \nto them, forcing prisoners to go long periods without them.  See Cokely Report at 52;   \n Dec. ¶¶ 3 – 13 (Ex. 27) (three year journey of fighting to get hearing aids and repairs); \n Dec. ¶ 11 (repairs take a long time, provided one but needs two aids);   \n Dec. ¶ 3 (has never been able to get one);   Dec. ¶¶ 10 - 13 (could not obtain \nhearing aid, then would not repair them);   Dec. ¶¶ 7 & 18 (could not obtain, \nkeeping them working and batteries);   Dec. ¶¶ 10 & 16 - 18 (could not obtain, not \nproperly fitted);   Dec. ¶ 5 (trouble getting, only got one hearing aid needed two); \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 20 of 51\n  docs  at  5425  (difficulty  obtaining  proper  battery  for  hearing  aid);   \n docs at 7109 & 93878 (Ex. 28) (asked for hearing aid for left ear and was told that \n“[o]ne hearing aid is issued per inmate”; received defective hearing aid in May 2015, which was \nsent out for repair and was lost as of January 2016).   \n  Moreover, the FDOC’s written hearing aid policy is facially insufficient in several ways.  \nFirst, it disallows hearing aids altogether unless the inmate has bilateral (both ears) hearing loss, \nand permits inmates to have only one hearing aid, even if they have bilateral hearing loss. See \nHealth Service Bulletin 15.03.27, Ex. 29 at 1594-95.  This bright-line rule violates the ADA’s \nrequirement of conducting an individualized inquiry into each request for an accommodation.  A \nperson who is deaf in only one ear still has a disability and may still need a hearing aid, whether \nit be for localizing sound or to hear conversations in places with loud ambient noise.  Second, the \npolicy only permits the replacement of a hearing aid every four years.  See id. at 1595.  This \nmeans when a hearing aid breaks—as they frequently do—the FDOC refuses to repair it until the \nnext four-year mark.  As demonstrated by the evidence above, this policy has resulted in many \nhard of hearing prisoners struggling for long periods without their much needed hearing aids. See \nBryant v. Dart, No. 13 C 3608, 2013 WL 5818810, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 29, 2013) (denying \nmotion to dismiss ADA claim of confiscating and failing to replace hearing aid in jail).     \nEighth Amendment.  Further, the Eleventh Circuit has squarely held that the failure to \nprovide a prisoner with a hearing aid constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Gilmore, 738 F.3d at 274-75.  The FDOC’s practices \npresent the significant risk of, and have actually resulted in, numerous inmates being denied \nmuch-needed medical care, despite the FDOC’s knowledge of that need.  See Ancata v. Prison \nHealth Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985).   \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 21 of 51\nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Equal and Meaningful Telecommunications Access \nOne of the most important aspects of prison life is being able to effectively communicate \nwith family, friends, loved ones, and lawyers outside of prison.  However, deaf and hard of \nhearing prisoners cannot use a regular phone, and require some kind of auxiliary aid or service to \nbe able to communicate.  Recognizing this, the regulations require that, when public entities \ncommunicate by telephone with “applicants and beneficiaries, text telephones (TTYs) or equally \neffective telecommunications systems shall be used to communicate with individuals who are \ndeaf or hard of hearing or have speech impairments.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.161(a).  See also Chisolm, \n275 F.3d at 330 (refusal to promptly provide telecommunication device for the deaf to deaf \nprisoner  without  engaging  in  individualized  inquiry  could  state  ADA  violation);  28  C.F.R. \n§35.160(a)(1) (“A public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with \napplicants, participants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as effective \nas communications with others.”). \nSome FDOC dorms have a teletypewriter (TTY), an archaic device that allows the users \nto type messages back and forth instead of speaking.  Cokely Report at 13. A TTY user can \ncommunicate with a person using a regular telephone via a relay service, which is a third party \nintermediary that relays the messages back and forth between the parties by typing and speaking. \nTTYs are obsolete, and are not used anymore by the vast majority of the deaf community.  \nCokely Report at 47.  But the FDOC even fails to make this consistently available.   First, many \ndeaf and hard-of-hearing prisoners are not housed in dorms with operable TTYs.  Second, in \nmany dorms the TTY is kept in a locked officers’ station, and to use it a prisoner must ask to \ncheck it out (often resulting in long wait times or outright refusals).  See Ex. 24 at 1696 \n(requiring TTY to be in a locked box).  In contrast, the non-deaf prisoners can simply use the \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 22 of 51\nregular phone at any point during the allowed times, thereby providing unequal access to the deaf \nand hard of hearing prisoners.  See Tanney v. Boles, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1043 (E.D. Mich. \n2005) (policy of keeping prison TTY locked in office with limited access could violate ADA).   \nThird, the TTYs are often broken, or officers don’t know how to work them.  See 28 C.F.R. § \n35.133(a)  (requiring  public  entities  to  maintain  in  operable  working  condition  the  features \nrequired  to  ensure  that  programs,  services,  and  activities  are  readily  accessible).    Fourth, \nalthough FDOC policy allows more time to use the TTY, the policy is routinely ignored, and \ndeaf prisoners are denied the time they need.  See Cokely Report at 47-48.  See also   \n Dec. ¶¶ 9 - 10 (TTY doesn’t work, can’t make collect calls, as of December 27, 2016 \nstill cannot call out);   Dec. ¶ 17;   Dec. ¶ 10;   Dec. ¶¶ 8 \n- 11 (denied use, broken TTY, can’t call through relay, as of December 27, 2016 still unable to \nmake calls);   Dec. ¶¶ 11 - 15 (his family is deaf, no videophones, calls take \nlong time, blocked calls, can’t call Video Relay System);   Dec ¶¶ 14 - 17 (TTY \nbroken, no TTY in dorm, forced to sign out, forced to wait, 15 min limit);   Dec. ¶¶ \n15 - 16;   Dec. ¶¶ 6 - 7 (TTY cord broken);   Dec. ¶¶ 8 - 17 (could not \ncall out, forced to use relay service to call deaf family, length of calls, blocked calls);   \nDec. ¶ 7 (TTY broken, denied videophone);   Dec. ¶¶ 7 - 9 (denied use, limited \ncall time, place in inaccessible location for him as wheelchair user);   docs at \n52455 (TTY not available at Columbia Annex);   docs at 110322 (denied access to \nTTY);   docs at 15962  (Ex. 63) (denied access to TTY);   docs \n95633, 96025-96031, 96043 (TTY system and Rape Hotline not working, inmates denied access \nto and use of TDD/TTY).    \nThere are other problems as well.  Calls cannot be made to certain numbers, such as the \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 23 of 51\nTIPS line, to anonymously report abuse or other misconduct.  See   Dec. ¶¶ 8 - 17 \n(can’t call TIPS);   Dec. ¶¶ 15 - 16 (still can’t access as of Jan 11, 2017).  In addition, \nprisoners and their families are charged more money to use the TTY.  See   Dec. \n¶¶ 13 - 14 (one bill for over $1000 for his grandfather); Cokely Report at 47-48.  \n   Because the TTY is obsolete, it has become increasingly unlikely that family members of \ndeaf prisoners will own one.  It also requires knowledge of written English and typing, which \nmany  deaf  people  whose  first  language  is  ASL  do  not  have.    The  most  current  form  of \ncommunication is the videophone, which is similar to Skype or videoconferencing.  Id. at 49-50. \nVideophones would allow ASL users to communicate in sign language directly with their loved \nones, or to communicate through an interpreter with someone who does not sign, without any \nstandard  phone  charges.  Currently,  Maryland,  Maine,  Vermont,  Virginia,  and  Wisconsin, \nprovide videophones in prisons, and other states are moving in that direction.10  Id. at 51. As \nexplained by Dr. Cokely, they are vastly superior to other methods of communication and should \nbe installed in prisons where deaf or hard of hearing prisoners are housed.   \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Adequate Alert Systems for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Prisoners \n  The FDOC does not have a system in place to ensure that deaf and hard-of-hearing \nprisoners are adequately alerted for critical events such as medical and legal call-outs, meal and \nrecreation times, and others.  Cokely Report at 36-39.  In most instances, an officer simply \nshouts the prisoner’s name into the dorm; if a deaf prisoner doesn’t hear and doesn’t respond, the \ncall-out is cancelled and the prisoner may miss an important event.  See   Dec. \n¶ 11 (won’t flash the lights for call-outs);   Dec. ¶ 15;   Dec. \n                                                 \n10 See Bambocci, Anthony, “How Technology Is Changing Deaf Inmates’ Ability to Connect \nwith  the  Outside  World,”  September  19,  2016,  Morning  Consult.

See 28 C.F.R. \n§35.163(a) (“A public entity shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired \nvision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, \nactivities, and facilities.”); Clarkson, 898 F. Supp. at 1047 (absence of visual alerts violates ADA \nand RA).   \n  The  solution,  as  explained  by  Dr.  Cokely,  is  simply  to  install  visual  alert  systems.  \nCokely Report at 38-39.   \nOther Auxiliary Aids and Services for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Prisoners \nThe FDOC has failed to provide other auxiliary aids and services, such as specialized \nradios, telecoils, vibrating watches, headphones, and closed captioning.  See   Dec. \n¶ 13 (amplifiers);   Dec. ¶ 19 (ubi duo device, vibrating watch);   \nDec. ¶¶ 4 - 6 (headphones with volume boosters);   Dec. ¶¶ 11 - 12 & 16 (radio \nand accessories, pocket talker);   docs at 33971-72 (Ex. 30) (denied radio and \nheadphone for two years).  Some aids are not provided because prisoners are not housed at \nfacilities that are equipped for their needs.  For example, some dorms and prisons have television \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 25 of 51\nwith closed captioning, or have transmitters that allow the TV audio to be transmitted to the \nspecialized headphones.  But many deaf and hard-of-hearing prisoners are not housed in these \nlocations.  And those that are housed in the proper locations often are not provided with the radio \nreceivers and telecoils that are required to receive the audio transmissions.  See Cokely Report at \n51-52;   Dec. ¶ 13 (no transmitter on TV for radio use).  Moreover, the FDOC \ndoes not ensure that the closed captioning is turned on and operative all the time.  See   \n Dec. ¶ 13 (captions off, too far away to see them);   Dec. ¶ 9 (captions off, \nguards do not help);   Dec. ¶ 9 (not always on);   Dec. ¶ 21 (captions off, \nplus too far away to see them);   Dec. ¶ 15.  See Chisolm, 275 F.3d at 330 (failure \nto provide closed captioning could support ADA violation).   \nVIOLATIONS REGARDING PRISONERS WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS \nThe FDOC Fails to Maintain Wheelchair-Accessible Facilities \n  Public entities are required to make their facilities physically accessible to those with \nmobility impairments and those who use wheelchairs.  The specific building guidelines vary \ndepending on the date the structure was built and whether alterations were made.   See 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.150 & 35.151.  Correctional systems are specifically required to “implement reasonable \npolicies,  including  physical  modifications  to  additional  cells  in  accordance  with  the  2010 \nStandards, so as to ensure that each inmate with  a disability is housed in a cell  with the \naccessible elements necessary to afford the inmate access to safe, appropriate housing.”  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.152(b)(3).  See also Clemons, 168 F. Supp. 3d at 1069 (granting summary judgment \nfor plaintiff and holding that housing inmate using wheelchair in cell that was not compliant with \naccessibility standards violated ADA and RA); Casey v. Lewis, 834 F. Supp. 1569, 1581 (D. \nAriz. 1993) (“Disabled inmates must be provided with physical accommodations necessary \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 26 of 51\nbecause of their disabilities, including adequate toilet and shower facilities.”); Shariff v. Coombe, \n655 F. Supp. 2d 274, 298-99 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (inability of wheelchair-using prisoners to access \nrestrooms amounted to Eighth Amendment violation).   \nAs demonstrated in the attached report of Plaintiff’s ADA architectural expert Mark \nMazz, several facilities are not compliant with the applicable standards in numerous ways.  See \nMazz Report (Exhibit 31).11  Mr. Mazz has conducted site inspections of 14 of the 40 facilities \nthat the FDOC has designated as wheelchair-accessible (his attached report covers 10 of those).   \nThe institutions vary by type, mission, security classification, and region; he can therefore draw \nsystem-wide conclusions based on his work.12  Moreover, those conclusion can be adapted to \nother prisons with the same design layout.  \nThe FDOC has been on notice for quite a while about the lack of compliance, not only \nfrom prisoner grievances, but from other cases.  For instance, in Martinetti v. Tucker, 11-CV-\n81146 (S.D. Fla.), an incarcerated man complained in 2011 that the prisons in which he was \nhoused were not wheelchair accessible.  A settlement was reached in early 2013, but the plaintiff \nwas forced to bring two motions to enforce it over the course of three years, after the FDOC \nfailed to bring the prisons into compliance.  See Martinetti Motions to Enforce (Exhibit 32).  The \nMartinetti case brought to light that there are 188 confinement cells spread across the FDOC that \n                                                 \n11 Mr. Mazz’s full report contains thousands of pictures, which are not attached because of their \nfile size.  The pictures have been provided to Defendant and will be provided to the Court under \nseal. \n \n12 The facilities surveyed by Mr. Mazz were chosen from the list of prisons that have been \ndesignated  as  wheelchair-accessible  by  the  FDOC,  which  was  provided  in  response  to  an \ninterrogatory.  At one point during this litigation, the FDOC indicated that it would be changing \nthis list. Not wanting to waste resources on surveying facilities that would no longer house \nwheelchair-using prisoners, Plaintiff asked for the new list, but FDOC refused provide it.  This \nmatter was discussed at the October 27, 2016, case management conference, wherein the Court \ndeclined to compel the FDOC to produce the new list.  See D.E. 47. The FDOC has not \nsupplemented its interrogatory response.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 27 of 51\nare out of compliance with ADA standards because the grab bars are positioned at a 45 degree \nangle  from  the  toilet,  which  the  FDOC  conceded  is  not  ADA-compliant.    See  Martinetti \nResponse  Motion  to  Enforce  (Exhibit  33);  Grizzard  Affidavit  (Exhibit  34).    More  recent \nlitigation in the case of McAninch v. Crews, 12-CV-00899 (M.D. Fla.) has confirmed that the \nproblem still exists.  Expert site inspections in that case revealed several areas of noncompliance \nat Columbia Correctional Institution Annex and Northwest Florida Reception Center Annex, \nincluding the issue with the 45-degree angle grab bars.  See Norkunas Reports (Exhibit 35).   The \nFDOC again conceded that this configuration is not ADA-compliant.  See Grizzard Dep., Ex. 36, \nat 36-38.  Thus, there are currently at least 188 confinement cells that the FDOC has conceded \nare not compliant.     \nIn  addition  to  noncompliance  with  the  architectural  requirements,  there  are  other \nimpediments that result in prisoners with disabilities receiving unequal access to the facilities, or \nbeing  excluded  from  them  altogether.    For  example,  bathrooms  and  showers  are  often \ninaccessible because a) there is an insufficient number of wheelchair-accessible toilets and \nshowers for the number of inmates in the dorm, b) shower wands or seats are frequently broken, \nc) the accessible shower—unlike the other showers—is exposed to the dorm, providing no \nprivacy to the user, and d) FDOC staff allow non-disabled prisoners to use the accessible toilet \nand shower.  See   Dec. ¶¶ 5 – 7 (Ex. 37) (at Columbia CI Annex, inaccessible cell \nwithout elevated footlocker, sinks without enough clearance underneath to fit his wheelchair and \ninsufficient space between bunks to maneuver wheelchair);   documents (Ex. 38) \n(at Columbia CI Annex insufficient space between bunks to maneuver wheelchairs, insufficient \nnumber of accessible toilets and inmates in wheelchairs do not have equal access to recreational \nactivities).

See   Dec. ¶¶ 6 - 8 (Ex. 46) \n(insufficient  space  under  tub  to  accommodate  wheelchair  lift,  insufficient  shower  hoses  in \ninfirmary at Dade CI, RMC, Zephyrhills, Suwanee, CFRC, Union; essentially put in isolation in \na hallway at Dade because facility could not accommodate him).    \n   Further, dining halls and forms have insufficient wheelchair-accessible seating.  See   \n Dec. ¶ 9 (insufficient wheelchair seating at Mayo CI Annex dining hall);   \nDec. ¶11, 14 (insufficient wheelchair seating at Suwannee CI Annex dining hall, television \nrooms at Suwannee CI Annex do not have sufficient space to accommodate wheelchairs);   \n Dec. ¶ 10 (insufficient wheelchair seating in dining hall);   Dec. ¶ 12 (no \naccessible scale in medical department at Mayo CI Annex to obtain proper weight);   \n Dec. ¶¶ 4 & 6 (insufficient wheelchair seating at Mayo CI Annex dining hall and \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 29 of 51\ntelevision area).   \nEighth Amendment.  In addition to violating the ADA and RA, these practices also \nexpose  inmates  to  conditions  that  deprive  them  of  the  minimal  civilized  measure  of  life’s \nnecessities, and constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, in violation of the \nEighth Amendment.  Brooks, 800 F.3d at 1303.  See also LaFaut v. Smith, 834 F.2d 389, 394 \n(4th Cir. 1987) (three months of being held in inaccessible cell violated Eighth Amendment); \nSimmons v. Cook, 154 F.3d 805, 808 (8th Cir. 1998) (confining paraplegic inmate in non-\naccessible cell is deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment).   \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs \n  As noted above, the FDOC must furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services to ensure \nthat facilities are meaningfully accessible.  28 C.F.R. § 35.160.  As with hearing aids, this \nincludes operable and properly fitted wheelchairs.  Without them, every facet of prison life is not \nequally accessible to someone with a mobility impairment.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.137(a) (requiring \npublic entities to permit individuals to use wheelchairs and other mobility aids); Dinkins v. Corr. \nMed. Servs., 743 F.3d 633, 634 (8th Cir. 2014) (putting paralyzed inmate in administrative \nsegregation without a wheelchair, forcing him to crawl and to eat meals on the floor, stated ADA \nand RA violation); Casey, 834 F. Supp. at 1581 (“Further, mobility impaired inmates must be \nprovided with wheelchairs and other mobility aids.”).  However, the FDOC fails to provide \nwheelchairs to prisoners who need them, and allows them to be confiscated by staff.   See   \n Dec. ¶¶ 5 – 10 & 14 (Ex. 47) (confiscated wheelchair in 2014 at Santa Rosa and made \nwritten requests to get it returned 1/2015, 6/2015, 9/2015, 11/2015, 12/2015, 1/2016 and did not \nreceive until mid-2016, removed from ADA list in response);   Dec. ¶¶ 16 - 17 \n(confiscated wheelchair in 2/2016 and has not been to chow hall in almost one year as it is too \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 30 of 51\ndifficult to get there; went to sick call approximately 10 times during 2016 to get passes renewed \nbut was denied);   Dec. ¶¶ 19 - 22 (confiscated his electric wheelchair; lost his \n$9,000 manual wheelchair in 2016; broke his expensive, manual wheelchair in 2006 or 2008; \nprison-issued wheelchairs are often broken, not properly repaired).   \nRequests  for  wheelchairs  are  often  denied  based  on  a  judgment  that  the  prisoner’s \nmedical condition is not serious enough to warrant a wheelchair. See, e.g.,   docs (Ex. \n48) at 116267-68 (denied walker because “[t]his is not an ADA issue.”).  In doing so the FDOC \nfails to give primary consideration to the wishes of the individual with the disability, in plain \nviolation of the ADA regulations.  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).  Rather, the FDOC simply relies on \ngeneralizations and false stereotypes about the level of the person’s impairment, without ever \nconsulting them.  See Wright, 831 F.3d at 78 (blanket ban on motorized wheelchair in prison \nviolates ADA and RA).   \n  When wheelchairs are provided, they often go unrepaired for long periods of time.  See \n Dec. ¶¶ 13 - 15 (requested new wheels in January 2012 and did not receive them \nfor almost six months; brakes on wheelchair broken and wheelchair approximately ten years old \ndespite  requests  since  2014  for  new  chair;  DOC  will  not  allow  custom  wheelchair  due to \n“security  issues”  even  though  DOC  issued  wheelchairs  do  not  support  ’  paralysis); \n Dec. ¶¶ 9 - 10 (forced to use a broken wheelchair for more than four months \nbefore being provided a replacement; has been issued an inappropriately sized wheelchair); \n Dec. ¶¶ 20 - 21 & 23 (FDOC fails to repair broken wheelchairs, issues \ninappropriately sized wheelchairs);   Dec. ¶¶ 4-5 (broke his electric wheelchair \nand didn’t repair it when he was released; refused to pad his manual wheelchair with padding \nfrom his electric wheelchair);   Dec. at 4901 & 4890 (requested new cushion in 2014 \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 31 of 51\nand 2015 because metal coming through seat);   Dec. ¶ 13 (front wheelchair wheels \nflat and brakes broken in excess of one year).  There is no consistency because some facilities do \nnot respect passes given at other facilities.  See   Dec. ¶ 13 (received grievance \nresponse saying that each facility has its own requirements for passes and he was not guaranteed \nwheelchair pass).  These delays also result in a lack of meaningful access.   \nEighth Amendment. The failure to provide medically necessary wheelchairs also violates \nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.  See \nSchmidt v. Odell, 64 F. Supp. 2d 1014 (D. Kan. 1999) (forcing inmate who was double amputee \nto crawl around jail floor to access jail facilities was sufficient to proceed to jury on Eighth \nAmendment  claim);  Lavender  v.  Lampert,  242  F.  Supp.  2d  821,  849  (D.  Or.  2002)  (“To \nunnecessarily deny the use of a wheelchair to someone who obviously has an injury, and who \nlacks mobility without it, would constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.”); \nWeeks v. Chaboudy, 984 F.2d 185, 187 (6th Cir. 1993) (refusal to permit paraplegic inmate to \nuse wheelchair violated Eighth Amendment). \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide, Train, and Monitor Wheelchair Assistants \n  The FDOC assigns other inmates to work as wheelchair pushers.  However, the FDOC \nfails  to  ensure  that  the  program  is  operating  properly.    Wheelchair  assistants  are  often \nunavailable, assigned to different dorms, or in confinement.  Many assistants are insufficiently \nvetted or trained, and are not monitored by FDOC to ensure that they are completing their \nresponsibilities.  See   Dec. ¶ 13 (during 2014 and 2015 filed more than 20 inmate \nrequests regarding problems with wheelchair pushers);   Dec. ¶¶ 23 & 25 (denied \npusher);    Dec.  ¶¶  15-16  (inmate  assistants  are  unreliable/in  gangs  and \nuntrained);   Dec. ¶ 13 (no pusher to go library, filed grievance in April and May \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 32 of 51\nof  2016,  both  returned  without  action);    Dec.  ¶¶  11  (frequently  went  without \nwheelchair pusher, took months to get pusher assigned).  A wheelchair-using prisoner is then \nforced to go through the grievance process to complain about it, which often results in months-\nlong delays in getting a replacement assistant.  Failing to properly administer this system in an \neffective manner violates the ADA and RA.  See Wright, 831 F.3d at 74 (“[B]y requiring inmates \nto make a formal request in advance for an aide, DOCCS has created a system which fails to \nprovide inmates with mobility assistants in situations where their need to move  cannot be \ncontemplated in advance.”).   \nThe FDOC Confiscates and Fails to Repair Prosthetic Devices \n  Prosthetic devices are critical for those who need them.  They allow a level of mobility \nand  independence  that  is  comparable  to  non-disabled  individuals.  Moreover,  not  using  a \nprosthetic device for long periods causes the muscles of the injured limb to atrophy or calcium to \nbuild up in the joint, thus making it impossible to use the device later without the appropriate \nphysical therapy or requiring additional amputation or further surgery.  The limb can also lose \nshape, causing the prosthesis to no longer fit, resulting in cuts, sores, ulcers, and scarring.   \n  But the FDOC confiscates these necessary prosthetic devices, causing prisoners to go \nlong periods without them, and also refuses to repair them when broken.  See   Dec. \n¶¶ 5 - 6 (not permitted to keep both wheelchair and prosthetic devices until injured in 2014; \nFDOC refuses to timely repair ill-fitting prosthetic devices); Villanueva Verified Complaint (Ex. \n49)  (confiscated  prosthetic  leg);    docs  (Ex.  50)  at  114667  (confiscated \nprosthesis).  The failure to provide these devices results in nearly every facet of prison life being \ninaccessible.   \nEighth Amendment.  Failing to provide and maintain necessary prosthetic devices also \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 33 of 51\nviolates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.  \nSee Gilmore, 738 F.3d at 274-75 (“We have, however, long held that deprivation of needed \neyeglasses  or  prosthetic  devices  stated  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  because  the \nunavailability of eyeglasses or prostheses may lead to severe harm.”).   \nVIOLATIONS REGARDING BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PRISONERS \n  People who are blind or have low vision face unique challenges, both in and out of \nprison.  Not only do they face difficulties in safely navigating their environment, they often face \nskepticism and confusion from sighted individuals who are unfamiliar with how a low vision \nperson  may  function.  A  blind  person’s  vision  may  regularly  fluctuate,  and  may  change \ndepending on the ambient lighting and what in particular is being viewed.  For instance, a person \nwith low vision may be able to read normal print indoors, but be totally blind in sunlight.  See \nSchroeder Report (Exhibit 51) ¶ 8.  See also   Dec. ¶ 11 (guards don’t believe he \nis vision impaired because he has some sight, guard waved middle finger at him and asked if he \ncould see it).   \n  Plaintiff’s expert Dr. Fredric Schroeder conducted site inspections of five FDOC prisons \nand interviewed 33 blind and visually impaired prisoners.  He has concluded that the FDOC is \nfailing to meet its obligations under the ADA and RA.  Schroeder Report at ¶ 1.  Dr. Schroeder \nfound that the FDOC’s “dysfunctional Call Out system, denial of reasonable accommodations, \ncapricious application of procedures, lack of access to education, inconsistent and poor access to \nlibrary services, lack of access to recreation and so on, suggests a failure on the part of the DOC \nto take seriously the human and civil rights of blind and visually impaired inmates and their \nspecific rights under the ADA.”   Id. at ¶ 26.1. \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 34 of 51\nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services to Blind and Visually Impaired \nPrisoners \n \n  As noted above, the FDOC must furnish appropriate auxiliary aids, services, and program \nmodifications to ensure blind and visually impaired prisoners are afforded equal and meaningful \naccess.  See 28 C.F.R. §35.160(b)(1).  Some specific accommodations include qualified readers; \ntaped  texts;  audio  recordings;  Brailled  materials  and  displays;  screen  reader  software; \nmagnification  software;  optical  readers;  large  print  materials;  and  accessible  electronic  and \ninformation technology.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  See also Kruger v. Jenne, 164 F. Supp. 2d 1330, \n1337–38 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (denying blind inmate an aide, a cane, an electric shaver, and a \naudiobook book player stated ADA claim); Mason v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., 559 \nF.3d 880, 886 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting 35.104).  \nBut the FDOC fails to provide even the most basic auxiliary aids and services, such as \nBraille, large print, and talking watches.  See Schroeder ¶ 17.9;   Dec. ¶ 23 (Ex. 53) \n(denied talking watch because he couldn’t afford one).  Likewise, blind prisoners do not have \naccess to recording devices, so they must rely on other prisoners to send and receive letters from \ntheir family and loved ones.  See Schroeder at ¶ 23.3;   Dec. ¶ 5 (denied a tape \nrecorder to dictate letters);   Dec. ¶ 17 (Ex. 54) (denied a tape recorder or a \nBraille machine to compose letters);   Dec. ¶ 17 (Ex. 55) (denied voice recorder).  \nSimilarly, Call Out lists are not printed in large print.  Schroeder ¶ 15.5.  Forcing blind and \nvisually impaired prisoners to rely on the goodwill of other prisoners for such basic services is \ndangerous and exposes them to unnecessary risk of abuse.  See Armstrong v. Brown, 857 F. Supp. \n2d 919, 933 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“Reliance on other prisoners for access to basic services, such as \nfood,  mail,  showers  and  toilets  by  prisoners  with  disabilities  leaves  them  vulnerable  to \nexploitation and is a dangerous correctional practice.”).   \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 35 of 51\nMoreover, inmates with cataracts and other conditions that make them sensitive to light \nor totally blind in bright light do not have consistent access to dark-tinted glasses and/or hats.  \nSee Schroeder at ¶ 9.3;   Dec. ¶ 10 (denied prescription dark tinted glasses); \n Dec. ¶ 19 (has trouble seeing anything in bright sunlight but has not been issued \ndark-tinted glasses or a hat).  Visually impaired prisoners have been denied the magnifiers they \nneed to read and write independently.  Schroeder ¶ 25.5; see also   Dec. ¶ 7 \n(magnifier was lost and never replaced);   Dec. ¶ 15 (denied a magnifier after \nrepeatedly asking for one).  Prisoners are also not provided with key locks, so that they can \nsecure their property like sighted prisoners do with combination locks.  Schroeder at ¶ 15.3 & \n17.6.  See also RMAR Documents (Ex. 23) at 2320-2322, 4648-4654, 4632-4637, 4391-4393, \n4394-4398, 4411-4422, 3795-3798, 3851-3853, 2264-2267, 4671-4677 (all denying requests for \nkey locks because FDOC deemed not medically necessary).  The failure of the FDOC to provide \nthese basic accommodations has forced some blind prisoners to spend the entire day sitting in \ntheir cell, afraid to go outside safely.  See Schroeder at ¶ 17.2;   Dec. ¶¶ 18 - 19.    \nFurther, the FDOC has created unnecessary barriers to blind inmates accessing services \nand programs independently.  For example, although FDOC policy allows grievances to be filed \norally, in practice they are not accepted unless they are in writing.    Dec. ¶ 8 (tried \nlodging verbal grievances and reasonable modification request but told he was not allowed).  Mr. \nEaly  also  had  trouble navigating  the  Disciplinary  Report (DR)  hearing  and  appeal  process \nbecause the DR appeal had to be filed in writing.  Id. at ¶ 24.  Before a DR hearing, prisoners \nhave the opportunity to request certain evidence be investigated.  In order to do so, they have to \nread and sign forms, which he was unable to do independently.

Schroeder ¶ 19.2.   In Florida, the Bureau of Braille and Talking Book Library \nprovides such reading materials in Braille and recorded audio format to eligible residents.  Id.  \nReading materials, including books and magazines, are sent to and from customers via a free \nmail program.  Id. at ¶ 19.3.  Excluding prisoners from the program violates the ADA.  See \nBarhite v. Trierweiler, No. 2:13-CV-169, 2014 WL 5782638, at *3-12 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 6, 2014) \n(denying blind inmate access to accommodations, including talking books, stated ADA claim); \nBrown v. Prelesnik, No. 1:12-CV-873, 2013 WL 838289, at *13 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 6, 2013) \n(same); Kruger, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 1337–38 (same).   \n  But  prisoners  are  being  excluded  from  the  Florida’s  Talking  Book  program.  See \nSchroeder at ¶ 19.4-19.11; see also   Dec. ¶¶ 12-13 & 17;   Dec. ¶¶ 10-\n12.  Enrolling is difficult and requires multiple trips to sick call, resulting in $5 copay charges \neach time.  See Schroeder at ¶ 25.3.  Even after enrolling, prisoners are subjected to unreasonable \nand inexplicable limitations.  Namely, blind and visually impaired prisoners can only access \nthree digital Talking Books at a time.  Schroeder ¶ 19.3.  In practice, this restriction results in \nblind  prisoners  having  access  to  far  fewer  books  than  sighted  prisoners,  because  when  an \nindividual is finished with a talking book, he must mail it back and wait for a replacement—a \nprocess that takes weeks or months.  Id. at ¶ 19.6.  In contrast, when a sighted inmate finishes a \nbook, he may return it to the prison library and immediately check out another book.  Id. at ¶ \n19.6.  Moreover, blind and visually impaired inmates are not allowed to select specific book \ntitles and are only allowed to identify topic areas, and are not permitted to receive magazine \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 37 of 51\nsubscriptions.  Id. at ¶ 19.8-19.10;   Dec. ¶ 11;   Dec. ¶ 31.13  These \nrestrictions are irrational and result in unequal access.  See Mason, 559 F.3d at 886.  \n  Plaintiff’s expert also found that confiscation of Talking Book players has been used by \nthe FDOC as a form of punishment.  Schroeder ¶ 19.14.    reported that he was denied \nTalking Books for four years because his family had sent him talking books through the mail.  \n Dec. ¶ 10.  Denial of an accommodation is never a legitimate form of punishment.  \nSchroeder ¶ 19.14. \nWhite Canes \n  The white cane is the most commonly recognized symbol of blindness.  Schroeder ¶ 16.1.  \nWhite canes allow some measure of independence by ensuring a clear walking path, and also \nalerts other prisoners to a person’s blindness, allowing those prisoners to avoid blocking their \npath and possibly providing assistance with minor tasks such as opening doors.  Federal courts \nhave found that denying prisoners white canes may be an ADA violation.  See Vandiver v. Prison \nHealth Servs., Inc., No. 1:14-CV-350, 2014 WL 2115264, at *3 & 11 (W.D. Mich. May 21, 2014) \n(taking away a white cane from a visually impaired prisoner stated an ADA claim); Armstrong, \n857 F. Supp. 2d at 932–33 (noting that taking away cane from a blind jail detainee violated his \nrights); Rickerson v. Gills, No. 5:11-CV-279-MP-GRJ, 2012 WL 1004733, at *1 (N.D. Fla. Feb. \n8, 2012) (taking away a cane and other accommodations from a blind prisoner stated an ADA \nclaim).   \nBut the FDOC fails to consistently provide white canes.  Some have been given some \nkind of stick as a substitute.  Some had canes but had them confiscated or lost during prison \n                                                 \n13 In some circumstances, blind prisoners don’t even receive books in their chosen topic areas.  \nFor example,   has asked for Christian books and has been repeatedly sent books \ndepicting sex and violence.  Schroeder ¶ 19.8. \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 38 of 51\ntransfers.  Some were told they could only have a white cane of a shorter length.  Schroeder ¶ \n16.2; see also   Dec. ¶ 16 (issued tap sticks that were too short and was denied \na white cane for a period of time).  Almost all prisoners interviewed by Plaintiff’s expert who \nhad been able to get a white cane reported that they were far too short.  See Schroeder ¶ 16.2, \nn.3.  Moreover, many prisoners reported being denied white canes altogether.  Id.;   \n Dec. ¶¶ 5 & 8 - 9.    had to wait five or six years to be issued a white cane.  \n Dec. ¶ 5.    had to wait nine years to get his.  Schroeder ¶ 16.2, n.3.  \nDenying a blind or visually impaired inmate a white cane constitutes “a serious breach of the \nhuman and civil rights of blind and visually impaired inmates and, by extension, a denial of their \nright to reasonable accommodations.”  Schroeder ¶ 16.2. \nBlindness Skills Training \n  The term “blindness skills training” encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques \nthat help blind or visually impaired individuals achieve maximum independent functioning.  \nSchroeder ¶ 11.1.  Blindness skills include self-care, such as learning to shave, independently \nadminister  medication,  and  function  in  the  home;  learning  to  use  a  white  cane  to  travel \nindependently  in  the  home  and  community;  and  learning  to  use  a  wide  range  of  assistive \ntechnology.  Id. at ¶ 11.1.  As Dr. Schroeder explains, accommodations for blind prisoners are in \nsome cases not useful unless the prisoners receive training on how to use them.  Simply giving \nan inmate a white cane without providing training on its use is analogous to giving someone a \ncar but not teaching the individual how to drive.  Id. at ¶ 10.3.   But the FDOC fails to provide \nany  training  at  all.    Id.  at  ¶¶  11.2-11.4.   This  failure  amounts  to  a failure  to  provide  the \naccommodations themselves, and thus violates the ADA and RA.   \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 39 of 51\nThe FDOC Fails to Properly Administer the Impaired Inmate Assistant Program for Blind \nor Visually Impaired Inmates \n \nThe FDOC sometimes assigns other prisoners to assist blind prisoners, but the program is \nnot properly administered.  Specifically, inmate assistants are selected by prison officials without \nthe involvement of the blind or visually impaired inmate; selected without having to demonstrate \nminimum skills (ability to read aloud, ability to follow basic instructions, etc.); are inconsistently \nand poorly trained; are untrained on the impact of additional disabilities on the needs and \nfunctioning of blind inmates; are often unwilling and/or unable to provide needed support; are \nworking  without  a  written  job  description  or performance  standards; are  handling  blind  or \nvisually impaired inmate’s sensitive and personal material with no guarantee of confidentiality; \nand are transferred without notice, resulting in periods of time during which the blind or visually \nimpaired inmate is without assistance.  Schroeder ¶¶ 11.4, 12.1 - 12.3, & 13.1-13.6; see also \n Dec. ¶¶ 5 - 9 (getting an inmate assistant to help him with reading, writing, and legal \nwork was a “constant battle” and he would often be without an inmate assistant for weeks or \nmonths at a time, filed 51 grievances about this in 2014 and had to beg and pay other prisoners to \nhelp file the grievances);   Dec. ¶¶ 9 - 10 & 14 (untrained and unreliable inmate \nassistants placed him in harm’s way causing him to need emergency medical treatment on \n10/19/12, 8/8/14 and 9/2/14; had more than five different assistants at Franklin CI and frequently \nwent  without  assistance  despite  numerous  requests to address  problem  in  2014  and  2015).  \nMoreover, some blind and visually impaired inmates are simply denied an inmate assistant \naltogether and left to fend for themselves without any blindness skills training or other necessary \nauxiliary aids and accommodations.  See   Dec. ¶ 15 (repeatedly asked for an \nimpaired inmate assistant but was never assigned one);   Dec. ¶ 7 (denied an \ninmate assistant multiple times).   \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 40 of 51\n  The FDOC’s written policy on inmate assistants for blind and visually impaired prisoners \nis insufficient.  Schroeder ¶¶ 13.1-13.6.  It does not permit blind and visually impaired inmates to \nbe actively involved in the selection of their assistant.  Id. at ¶ 13.1.  The training protocols do \nnot include sufficient guidelines on guiding visually impaired inmates; orienting the blind or \nvisually impaired inmate to his environment; assisting the blind or visually impaired inmate to \nengage in recreational activities; following instructions related to reading aloud letters and other \nprinted materials, including legal materials; assisting the blind inmate at mealtimes; and assisting \nblind inmates who have additional disabilities that affect balance or other functions.  Schroeder ¶ \n13.5.  The training provided to assistants is inadequate.  Id. at ¶ 13.6.  \nThe FDOC Fails to Ensure Equal and Meaningful Access to the Law Library for \nBlind or Visually Impaired Prisoners \n \nBlind and visually impaired prisoners are denied equal access to the law library, which is \na violation of the ADA.  Schroeder ¶¶ 20.1-20.5.  See also Cole v. Velasquez, 67 F. App’x 252 \n(5th Cir. 2002) (reversing a district court decision dismissing an ADA claim by a legally blind \ninmate against a law library supervisor).  The FDOC’s law libraries are not equipped with \nstandard screen enlarging software (Zoomtext) and text-to-speech software (JAWS), nor do they \nhave private spaces available to enable the blind or visually impaired inmate’s assistant or a law \nclerk to read material aloud.  Schroeder ¶ 20.2.   \nMoreover,  law  clerks  are  inadequately  trained  and  supervised.    It  was  consistently \nreported to Dr. Schroeder that law clerks were demanding payment from blind and visually \nimpaired inmates before helping them with reading and writing their legal work.  Schroeder \n¶ 20.3; see also   Dec. ¶ 20 (law clerks wouldn’t help him unless they were paid and \nhe wouldn’t be given enough time with them).  This has infringed on blind prisoners’ access to \ncourts.  See   Dec. ¶ 9 (missed legal deadlines after being refused auxiliary aids to \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 41 of 51\nhelp him read and write and also being denied the assistance of a law clerk). Finally, Dr. \nSchroeder found that access to a law clerk is not a replacement for assistive technology because \nnon-disabled inmates have the ability to conduct independent research. Schroeder ¶ 20.5.    \nThe FDOC Fails to Provide Adequate Vision-Related Medical Treatment  \nThe  FDOC  fails  to  provide  blind  and  visually  impaired  inmates  with  prompt  and \nadequate vision-related medical treatment, often resulting in the avoidable loss of remaining \nvision.  Schroeder  ¶  9.1;  see  also    Dec.  ¶  3  (has  deteriorating  vision  due  to \nglaucoma and cataracts but hasn’t seen an ophthalmologist since October 2015).   , \n, and   all reported that they were able to get cataract surgery on one \neye but were denied surgery on the other.  Schroeder ¶ 9.2.  This policy of providing surgery on \nonly eye is improper.  Bilateral vision is vital to depth perception and needed for safe mobility.  \nSchroeder ¶ 9.2.  This pattern and practice of medical delay, denial, and neglect also constitutes \ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.   \nVIOLATIONS COMMON TO ALL PRISONERS WITH DISABILITES \n  The FDOC engages in several practices that affect the rights of all prisoners with physical \ndisabilities.   \nThe FDOC Fails to Identify Prisoners with Disabilities  \n  The  FDOC’s  affirmative  obligations  include  identifying  people  with  disabilities  and \nperiodically reassessing their communication skills. See 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A. (“Because the \nappropriateness of particular auxiliary aids and services may vary as a situation changes, the \nDepartment  strongly  encourages  public  entities  to  do  a  communication  assessment  of  the \nindividual with a disability when the need for auxiliary aids and services is first identified, and to \nre-assess communication effectiveness regularly throughout the communication.”).  See also \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 42 of 51\nCokely Report at 33-35 (recommending development of individualized communication plan that \nis more than medical assessment).  \nBut the FDOC fails to do this.  The FDOC maintains an electronic system that records \nwhether prisoners have certain physical disabilities.  The output from this system has identified   \n2,323 prisoners with physical disabilities (367 who are deaf or hard of hearing, 327 who are \nblind or have low vision, 1,707 who have mobility impairments, and 636 who use wheelchairs).  \nSee Ex. 2. But these numbers cannot possibly represent all Florida prisoners with disabilities.  \nFor  instance,  a  recent  ACLU  Report  found  that  approximately  20%  of  the  Florida  prison \npopulation—or 19,787 prisoners—have been assigned some kind of assistive device or special \npass indicating a mobility impairment. ACLU Report (Ex. 5) at 7-8. Using the BJS percentages \ndescribed above (see Ex. 1), the FDOC should have identified roughly 6,925 prisoners with \nvision disabilities, 6,134 prisoners with hearing disabilities, and 9,893 prisoners with mobility \nimpairments. \nMoreover,  Plaintiff  has  identified  numerous  prisoners  who  have  clear  physical \ndisabilities, but were not identified as such in the FDOC system.  See   docs (Ex. \n56)  at  2748-49  (documenting  Mr.  ’s  hearing  impairment);    Dec.  ¶  2 \n(documenting deafness);   docs (Ex. 57) at 4589 (documenting hearing impairment); \n docs (Ex. 58) at 2649-50 (documenting myasthenia gravis/muscular weakness, \nknee deformity, and showing he uses a wheelchair);   docs (Ex. 59) at 20282-\n83 (documenting compressed discs, bulging disc, arthritis, and permanently injured knee, use of \ncane);  Schroeder  ¶¶  9.1  n.1,  17.1,  17.3,  &  25.2  (documenting    vision \nimpairment); Schroeder ¶¶ 9.1 n.1, 16.2 n.3, 19.4, & 20.3 (documenting   vision \nimpairment);   Dec. ¶ 2 (documenting blindness);   documents (Ex. \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 43 of 51\n60) at 52239, 94229-30 (documenting advanced glaucoma);   docs. (Ex. 61) at 2542 \n(documenting  impaired  vision);    docs  (Ex.  62)  at  2644-45  (documenting \nblindness).  See also   Dec. ¶¶ 8 & 10 - 14 (repeatedly grieved for auxiliary aids and \ntold that the FDOC doesn’t have sufficient documentation of his disability to get them). \nThe failure to identify prisoners with disabilities prevents the FDOC from implementing \nany accommodation, aids, or services to the thousands of prisoners who have not been identified.  \nThe FDOC Excludes Prisoners with Disabilities from Jobs and Programs \n  Jobs and programs are critical for the lives of prisoners.  They enable prisoners to earn \ngain-time (thereby reducing their sentence), provide them with job training and a daily purpose \nwithin prison, and occasionally permit them to earn money.  But the FDOC does not permit \nprisoners with certain disabilities to work in certain jobs.  Many prisoners with disabilities are \nrelegated to being housemen, a janitorial position that involves cleaning the dorm.  Or, it imposes \nblanket rules that have the effect of discriminating against prisoners with disabilities.  See \nCokely Report at 54; Mazz Report at 7; Schroeder ¶ 22.  See also   Dec. ¶ 17 (only \npermitted to work as houseman despite requests for different job because uses a wheelchair); \n Dec. ¶ 8 (denied work in kitchen and library);   Dec. ¶ 12 (denied \nPRIDE and work release);   Dec. ¶¶ 9 & 19 - 20 (can’t access programs, forced \nto be a Housewoman);   Dec. ¶¶ 7 - 8;   Dec. ¶¶ 11 - 12 (not \npermitted to participate in masonry class because of mobility impairment; not permitted to \nparticipate in puppies for prisoners class because of vision impairment; denied placement in \nfaith-based dorm at NWFRC Annex because they didn’t have a wheelchair bed);   \nDec.  ¶  11  (denied  Alcoholics  Anonymous,  Narcotics  Anonymous,  Landscape  Operations, \nCommercial Foods, PC Support Services, Architectural Drafting, and transition program);   \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 44 of 51\n  Dec.  ¶¶  21  -  22  (not  permitted  work  release,  vocational,  and  educational  classes;  at \nColumbia Annex, was told that because he used a wheelchair, he couldn’t be weighed and \ntherefore couldn’t go to work release);   Dec. ¶ 12 (could not go to faith based \ndorm at NWFRC because no wheelchair bed available);   docs at 16405 (not \npermitted to work or go outside the gate because he is deaf);   docs at 100810 \n(denied PRIDE job because he is deaf and was told he has a “communication problem”).   \n  Restricting the types of jobs and programs available to prisoners with disabilities violates \nthe ADA regulations, which prohibit a public entity from “utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of \nadministration: . . . That have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i). See also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8) (prohibiting the \nuse of “eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or \nany class of individuals with disabilities”).  Indeed, even though the “[a] public entity may \nimpose legitimate safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of its services, programs, \nor activities[,]” it “must ensure that its safety requirements are based on actual risks, not on mere \nspeculation,  stereotypes,  or  generalizations  about  individuals  with  disabilities.”    28  C.F.R. \n§35.130(h).    See  also  Wright,  831  F.3d  at  78  (quoting  the  regulations);  28  C.F.R. \n35.152(b)(2)(iii) (“[A] public entity . . . [s]hall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in \nfacilities that do not offer the same programs as the facilities where they would otherwise be \nhoused.”).   The FDOC, rather than completing the individualized inquiry to determine whether a \nparticular prisoner can do a particular job, simply enforces blanket rules, in violation of the \nADA.  \n \n \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 45 of 51\nThe FDOC Imposes Illegal Surcharges for Aids, Services, and Accommodations \n  The FDOC “may not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any \ngroup of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of \nauxiliary aids or program accessibility, that are required to provide that individual or group with \nthe nondiscriminatory treatment required by the Act or this part.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(f).  Several \ncourts have struck down even nominal fees under this provision.  See Dare v. California, 191 \nF.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir. 1999) ($6 fee for disability parking placard violates ADA); Klingler v. \nDir., Dep’t of Revenue, State of Mo., 433 F.3d 1078, 1082 (8th Cir. 2006) ($2 fee for disability \nparking placard violates ADA).  \n  But the FDOC violates this provision in several ways.  First, to obtain or renew any \naccommodation or auxiliary aid—including wheelchairs, hearing aids, specialized headphones, \nwhite canes, radios, etc.—a prisoner is required to have a medical visit, at which point a $5 \ncopayment is charged.   See Fla. Stat. § 945.6037 (imposing the copayment).  See   \nDec. ¶ 19 (charged co-payments for routine pass renewal and prescription refills);   \nDec. ¶¶ 9 & 11 (sent to medical to correct issues with impaired inmate assistant not doing job); \n docs at 16000 (forced to go to medical to get passes);   Dec. ¶¶ 8 - \n13 (told to go to medical about TV transmitter and TTY).  See also RMAR Documents (Ex. 23) \nat 4157-4159, 3941-3943, 4738-4741, 3948-3950, 3039-3041, 4232-4237, 4160-4169, 4112-\n4114, 2396-2399 (requests for accommodations all denied and inmates instructed to be evaluated \nby medical department).  Whereas a prisoner who can hear can watch the television for free, a \nprisoner who needs a special radio can only access the television after he pays a $5 copayment \nand waits for a medical appointment.  The copayment is the equivalent of an illegal surcharge.   \nSecond, the FDOC has required prisoners to pay for certain devices such as headphones, \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 46 of 51\nvibrating watches, telecoils loops, and specialized radios.   See   Dec. ¶ 11 (paid \nfor his vibrating watch);   Dec. ¶¶ 15 - 16 (batteries, and paid for vibrating watch); \n Dec. ¶ 12 (approved for radio if he buys himself, but can’t afford it);   \n Dec. ¶ 15 (paid for his vibrating watch);   Dec. ¶ 18 (had to pay for his \nspecial  headphones);    Dec.  ¶  12  (paid  for vibrating  watch).    See  also  RMAR \nDocuments  (Ex.  23)  at  4697-4700,  4688-4690,  4252-4257,  3174-3180  (requests  for \naccommodations all denied, instructing inmates to purchase items themselves).  Again, charging \nprisoners for these devices that the FDOC is required to provide plainly violates the regulation.    \n The FDOC Retaliates Against Prisoners with Disabilities and Interferes with Their Ability \nto Report Disability-Related Issues  \n \n  The  ADA  prohibits  retaliation  against  an  individual  because  “such  individual  has \nopposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a \ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or \nhearing  under [the ADA].”   42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.134(a).  It also prohibits \n“coerc[ing], intimidate[ing], threaten[ing], or interfer[ing] with any individual in the exercise or \nenjoyment of, or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his or her \nhaving aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right \ngranted or protected by [the ADA].”  42 U.S.C. § 12203(b); 28 C.F.R. § 35.134(b).   \n  FDOC staff regularly retaliate against prisoners for lodging disability complaints.  See \n Dec. ¶ 16 (subjected to threats in 2016 by medical staff and guards at RMC); \n Dec. ¶ 15 (subjected to threats by DOC staff and all legal papers destroyed in 2015 \nin retaliation);   Dec. ¶¶ 12 - 13 (at Mayo CI Annex was ridiculed by DOC staff \nand subjected to bogus disciplinary reports as retaliation for filing grievances and trying to help \nother inmates);   Dec. ¶ 13 (at Gulf CI told by DOC staff that if he did not stop \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 47 of 51\nwriting grievances, they would have someone at compound “take care of” him);   \nDec. ¶ 6 (forced to interpret for other deaf IM under threats);   Dec. ¶ 20 \n(threatened by officers);   Dec. ¶ 11 (threatened with confinement if she refused \nto attend drug program without interpreters);   Dec. ¶¶ 22 - 25 (told he was moved \nbecause he files many grievances);   Dec. ¶ 19 (“Because of the grievances I filed, I \nwas  threatened,  retaliated  against,  and  placed  in  confinement  by  prison  staff  and \nadministration”);   Dec. ¶ 15 (believes he has been denied auxiliary aids because he \nrepeatedly grieved denial of medical treatment for his degenerative eye condition);   \n docs at 96383 (Ms.   was mocked and told to shut up by a corrections office for \ncommunicating  in  ASL;  instructed  “not  to  teach  sign  language  in  pill  line”  because \ncommunicating in ASL is a “distraction”);   docs at 96044-96045 (threatened with \nDR if he reported officer’s conduct).  These actions violate the ADA’s prohibition on retaliation \nand interference.   \nConclusion \n  Prisons are “unique facilities under title II.”  28 C.F.R. part 35 app. A. “Inmates cannot \nleave the facilities and must have their needs met by the corrections system.”   Id.   The \nimportance of these facilities being fully accessible cannot be overstated.  But, as demonstrated \nabove,  the  FDOC  has  failed  in  its  responsibility  to  achieve  that.    Accordingly,  Plaintiff \nrespectfully requests that this Court grant summary judgment in its favor and declare that the \nFDOC  has  violated,  and  continues  the  violate,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act, \nRehabilitation Act, Eighth Amendment, and Due Process Clause, with respect to the issues \ndescribed above.   \nShould the Court grant this Motion as to some or all of the issues, Plaintiff would \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-RH-CAS   Document 62   Filed 01/30/17   Page 48 of 51\nrespectfully request the opportunity to confer with the Defendant as to the appropriate remedy, \nand brief the Court accordingly.   \n \nCertificate of  Word  Limit.

Case No.  \n                                         \nJULIE JONES, in her official capacity as \nSecretary of the Florida Department of  \nCorrections,   \n               \nDefendant.                  \n__________________________________________ \n \nCOMPLAINT \nFOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n1.  The Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) consistently violates the federal \nlaws  protecting  people  with  disabilities  who  are  incarcerated  in  the  Florida  prison  system.   \nThese  violations  exclude  Florida  prisoners  from  numerous  FDOC  programs,  services,  and \nactivities,  and  cause  them  to  suffer  from  the  humiliation,  indignity,  and  difficulties  that \naccompany such exclusion.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Florida, Inc., the federally designated \nProtection and Advocacy Agency for the state of Florida, brings this action under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Eighth Amendment, and the Due Process \nClause, to redress the FDOC’s pattern and practice of statutory and constitutional violations \nagainst prisoners with disabilities.    \nJurisdiction and Venue \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 in that this is a civil \naction arising under the Constitution of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) \nin that this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured to \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 2 of 123\nthe Plaintiff by the Constitution and laws of the United States.  \n3.  Plaintiff’s claims for relief are predicated, in part, upon 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which \nauthorizes actions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges, and \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Plaintiff’s claims are also \nbrought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the \nRehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. § 794.   \n4.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, \nas well as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.   \n5.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and 1391(c), as \nDefendant does business in this judicial district and many of the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claims occurred in this judicial district.  \nParties \n6.  Plaintiff  Disability  Rights  Florida,  Inc.  (DRF)  is  a  not-for-profit  corporation \nserving as Florida’s federally funded Protection and Advocacy agency for individuals with \ndisabilities, and serves as such by Executive Order signed by the Governor of Florida.  Among \nother things, DRF is authorized to “pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies \nor approaches to ensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the rights of individuals within the \nState who are or who may be eligible for treatment, services, or habilitation….” 42 U.S.C. § \n15043(a)(2)(A)(i)f. \n7.  Defendant Julie Jones is the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections \n(FDOC), and is sued in her official capacity.  References to the FDOC herein also refer to \nDefendant Jones.  Defendant Jones is responsible for the operation of Florida’s prison system, \nincluding compliance with the Constitution and federal laws.  Defendant Jones has statutory \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 3 of 123\nauthority to implement the relief sought in this Complaint.  See Fla. Stat. § 20.315.   \n8.  The FDOC is a public entity under Title II of the ADA, and receives federal \nfinancial assistance within the meaning of the RA, and has at all relevant times.   \n9.  At all relevant times, the actions of Defendant and her agents were state action \nand were taken under color of state law.  All staff members mentioned herein were employees or \nagents of Defendant and acted within the scope of their employment or agency at all relevant \ntimes.   \n10.  Plaintiff  has  no  adequate  remedy  at  law.    Unless  enjoined  by  this  Court, \nDefendant will continue to subject the prisoners in its custody to violations of their statutory and \nconstitutional rights.  \nFactual Allegations \nPlaintiff Disability Rights Florida, Inc. \n11.  Congress has created a nationwide Protection and Advocacy (P&A) System to \nprotect the legal and human rights of people with disabilities.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794e.  Each state \nhas a designated P&A organization; Plaintiff Disability Rights Florida (DRF) serves as the P&A \nfor the state of Florida.  DRF has authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate \nremedies or approaches to ensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the rights of people with \ndisabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(3); 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i)f.  \n12.  DRF has standing on behalf of its constituents and clients who are substantially \naffected by Defendant’s noncompliance with constitutional and statutory protections because \nsuch  noncompliance  falls  within  DRF’s  general  scope  of  interest  and  activity;  the  relief \nrequested—declaratory and injunctive—is the type of relief appropriate for DRF to receive on \nbehalf of its individual constituents; and neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 4 of 123\nrequire the participation of individual members or constituents in the lawsuit. \n13.  DRF’s  constituents  have  suffered  injury—and  continue  to  suffer  injury—that \nwould allow them to have standing to sue in their own right.  The interests DRF seeks to protect \nare germane to DRF’s purpose.  \n14.  DRF  has  a  multi-member  board  of  directors  that  includes  persons  with \ndisabilities. \n15.  DRF has an advisory council composed of people with disabilities who have \nsignificant input into the goals and objectives of the organization. \n16.  DRF  provides  the  opportunity  for  the  public,  including  its  stakeholders,  to \ncomment on its goals and objectives. \n17.  DRF  has  a  grievance procedure  that  complies  with  federal  requirements  and \nensures that individuals receive necessary services.  \n18.  One  of  DRF’s  primary  responsibilities  is  to  investigate  the  failure  of  public \nentities to comply with the ADA, RA, and other laws protecting DRF’s members, clients, and \nconstituents.   \n19.  People  with  physical  disabilities—among  DRF’s  constituents—are  on  DRF’s \nboard of directors.  DRF represents people with physical disabilities and provides the means by \nwhich they express their collective views and protect their collective interests.   \n20.  Many  persons  with  disabilities  who  are  incarcerated  in  the  FDOC  system, \nincluding many described below, have complained to DRF about the FDOC’s failure to comply \nwith the ADA, RA, and other laws protecting DRF’s constituents.  DRF has used, and continues \nto use, its resources to investigate these violations.  \n \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 5 of 123\nFDOC’s Systemic Violations of Laws Protecting People with Disabilities \n21.  The  FDOC  systematically  violates  the  federal  laws  protecting  persons  with \ndisabilities in its custody.  This includes but is not limited to prisoners who are deaf, hard of \nhearing, blind, have low vision, and have mobility impairments. The FDOC has violated, and \ncontinues to violate, the ADA, RA, Eighth Amendment, and Due Process Clause in the following \nways.  This is not an exhaustive list. \na.  Failure  to  Provide  Qualified  Interpreters.  The  FDOC  fails to  provide  qualified \ninterpreters  to  deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  prisoners  in  critical  situations  such  as \norientations,  medical  and  mental  health  appointments,  disciplinary  hearings, \nclassification reviews, religious services, educational programs, and court hearings \nheld by phone.  If a prisoner knows sign language, FDOC policy requires a sign \nlanguage  interpreter  for  extended  health  care  visits,  and  even  prohibits  the \nconsideration of less effective alternatives.  But the FDOC repeatedly violates its \nown policy by not providing interpreters at all.  When “interpreters” are provided, \nthey often consist of other prisoners or untrained FDOC staff, compromising the \nconfidentiality of these critical interactions.  This failure results in many deaf or hard \nof hearing prisoners being unable to communicate, participate, or understand what is \nhappening during these interactions.   \nb.  Failure  to  Provide  Auxiliary  Aids  and  Services.    The  FDOC  fails  to  provide \nprisoners with physical disabilities with appropriate auxiliary aids and services such \nas  hearing  aids,  modified  headphones,  vibration  alert  devices,  visual  signaling \ndevices,  closed  or  open  captioning,  television  transmitters,  assistive  listening \ndevices, and specialized radios, which would allow these prisoners to access FDOC \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 6 of 123\nprograms, services, and activities.  The FDOC allows prisoners to go long periods \nwithout them.  The FDOC also has a policy of only replacing hearing aids every four \nyears, and only permitting prisoners to possess one hearing aid at a time, regardless \nof the prisoner’s level of hearing loss.  The FDOC also operates under the false \nstereotype that once a prisoner is given a hearing aid, his or her hearing is restored to \nperfect levels; the FDOC then refuses to provide any further accommodations even if \nthe prisoner needs them.  For prisoners with visual disabilities, the FDOC fails to \nprovide text-to-speech software or qualified readers that would allow access to the \nlibrary and other written materials.  The FDOC also fails to provide prisoners with \nqualified assistants; when such assistants are provided, the FDOC fails to ensure that \nthey are properly vetted and trained, and fails to ensure they are completing their \nresponsibilities effectively. The FDOC also does not allow prisoners with low vision \nto have special devices if the prisoner has any vision whatsoever, again operating \nunder the false stereotype that no further accommodations are required unless a \nprisoner is completely blind.     \nc.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. The FDOC fails to provide \ndeaf  and  hard  of  hearing  prisoners  with  effective  telecommunications  access.  \nCommunication with friends and family is critical for incarcerated people, but deaf \nor  hard  of  hearing  prisoners  cannot  use  a  typical  voice  phone,  and  require \naccommodations to communicate with loved ones.  However, many prisons have no \nsuch accommodations, and the ones that do often prevent prisoners from using them.  \nAlthough some prisons have teletypewriters (TTY),1 many do not.  When they do \n                         \n1 A teletypewriter (TTY) is an archaic device that allows the users to type messages back and forth instead of speak-\ning.  A TTY user can communicate with a person using a voice telephone via a relay service, which is a third party \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 7 of 123\nexist, they are frequently broken, inaccessible, or are not made available in the same \nmanner as the voice phones for the non-deaf prisoners.  The TTY calls also result in \nhigher charges for prisoners’ families, and the TTYs often cannot make calls to \ncertain numbers, such as the abuse hotline.  Moreover, the most effective and current \ntechnology for people who can sign is a videophone, which allows the deaf person to \ncommunicate quickly and effectively through signing, and allows the party receiving \nthe call to effectively participate in the call through a video relay interpreter.  But the \nFDOC does not provide videophones.  As of result of these failures, many deaf or \nhard of hearing prisoners have been unable to communicate with their loved ones \nand attorneys.  \nd.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.   Deaf and hard of hearing \nprisoners cannot hear the announcements for critical events such as counts, meal \ntimes, medical and legal call-outs, recreation time, and others.  The FDOC fails to \nprovide  alerts  such  as  flashing  lights  or  vibrating  watches  to  effectively \ncommunicate with deaf and hard of hearing prisoners.  As a result, these prisoners \noften miss these events, and are subject to discipline for failing to obey verbal \norders.   \ne.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities. The FDOC fails to ensure that \nprisoners using wheelchairs are housed in areas that are fully wheelchair accessible, \nthus  preventing  those  persons  from  receiving  equal  and  meaningful  access  to \nprograms, services, and activities such as bathrooms, showers, recreation areas, and \n                                                                               \nintermediary that relays the messages back and forth between the parties by typing and speaking. TTYs are based on \n50-year-old technology, and are not used anymore in the vast majority of settings.  Currently, Idaho, Kentucky, \nMaryland, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin provide videophones in prisons.   \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 8 of 123\ndining halls.  For example, prisoners using wheelchairs are frequently housed in \ndorms with only one wheelchair-accessible bathroom and shower, resulting in long \nwait times and inequitable access to these facilities.  Many times the accessible \nshower—unlike the other showers—is exposed to the dorm, providing no privacy to \nthe  user.    Shower  chairs  and  wands  are  frequently  broken.    Dining  halls  have \ninsufficient wheelchair-accessible seating, resulting in long wait times.  Finally, \nmany  prisons  do  not  have  wheelchair-accessible  outdoor  recreation  facilities, \npreventing wheelchair users from accessing them.     \nf.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants. The FDOC fails to \nprovide wheelchairs to prisoners who need them for mobility.  When it does provide \nwheelchairs, it fails to maintain them or provides the wrong size, thus rendering \nthem inoperable.  The FDOC also fails to ensure that prisoners with wheelchairs \nhave assistants to help them move about the prison compound. When such assistants \nare provided, they are oftentimes insufficiently vetted and trained, and the FDOC \nfails to ensure that they are properly completing their duties.  The result is that \nprisoners with limited mobility are excluded from FDOC programs, services, and \nactivities, and are denied the minimal necessities of civilized life. \ng.  Failure to Allow and Maintain Prosthetic Devices.  The FDOC often takes away \nprisoners’  prosthetic  devices  upon  arrival  to  the  FDOC  system.  Prisoners  are \nsometimes given an inadequate substitute such as a pair of wooden crutches, which \nresults in the prisoner losing mobility and being excluded from FDOC programs, \nservices, and activities, and being denied the minimal necessities of civilized life.  \nFor those prisoners who are allowed to keep their prosthetic devices, the FDOC does \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 9 of 123\nnot repair or replace them when broken.   \nh.  Exclusion  from  Jobs  and  Programs.  The  FDOC  prohibits  otherwise  qualified \nprisoners with disabilities from participating in jobs and programs because of their \ndisabilities.  For instance, many deaf prisoners have been prohibited from working in \nprison industry programs or other jobs because they are deaf.  \ni.  Imposing Surcharges for Aids, Services, and Accommodations. The FDOC imposes \nillegal surcharges on prisoners with disabilities to cover the cost of measures that \nFDOC is required to provide to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment.  For example, \nthe FDOC requires prisoners to schedule a medical appointment to obtain or renew \npasses for wheelchairs, hearing aids, and other auxiliary aids, and each medical \nappointment requires the prisoner to pay a $5 copayment.  Moreover, the FDOC \nrequires prisoners to pay for certain auxiliary aids and services such as amplifiers, \nassistive listening devices, cup-style headphones, radio equipment, and others, even \nthough FDOC policy requires that they be provided at FDOC expense.  \nj.  Engaging in Retaliation and Interference.  FDOC staff routinely retaliate against \nprisoners who assert their disability related rights.  Prisoners are threatened to stop \nfiling grievances, and their property is unfairly confiscated for doing so.  FDOC staff \ninterfere with prisoners’ exercise of their ADA rights by warning them not to report \nADA violations.   \nk.  Failure to Give Primary Consideration.  The FDOC routinely fails to give primary \nconsideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities in determining what \ntypes of auxiliary aids and services are necessary and effective.  In fact, the FDOC \nrarely  seeks  any  input  at  all  from  prisoners  with  disabilities  in  making  that \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 10 of 123\ndetermination.   \nl.  Failure to Train Personnel on the Requirements of Federal Disability Laws.  The \nFDOC has left much of the responsibility for complying with federal disability laws \nin the hands of its line staff.  However, staff have not been properly and rigorously \ntrained on the correct application of these laws. This results in many necessary \naccommodations being denied or delayed.   \nExamples of FDOC’s Failures \n22.  All persons described herein are qualified individuals with a disability, in that \nthey, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices; the removal of \narchitectural, communication, or transportation barriers; or the provision of auxiliary aids and \nservices; meet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation \nin programs or activities provided by the FDOC.   \n23.  The FDOC knows that the individuals described herein are qualified individuals \nwith disabilities.   \n24.  All persons described herein have, by reason of their disability, been excluded \nfrom participation in or been denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the \nFDOC, or have been subjected to discrimination by the FDOC. \n25.  All persons described herein suffer from serious medical needs. \n26.  The  events  described  herein  are  not  isolated  incidents;  they  are  but  some \nexamples of the FDOC’s failure to comply with federal laws protecting people with disabilities. \n27.  These violations will continue unless enjoined by this Court.   \n \n \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 11 of 123\nPrisoners Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing \nKevin Stephans \n28.  Kevin Stephans was incarcerated in the FDOC system from October 2013 to \nOctober 2015.  He is deaf, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including \nbut not limited to hearing.   He requires the use of hearing aids in both ears.  His primary method \nof communication is American Sign Language (ASL).2 With his hearing aids, Mr. Stephans is \nable to speak and is somewhat able to hear.  However, Mr. Stephans’s first language is ASL and \nhe rates his English literacy at a 6th or 7th grade level.  Mr. Stephans does not understand more \ncomplicated English words, and writing is difficult for him. \n29.  During  his incarceration,  Mr.  Stephans  was  frequently  forced  to  serve  as  an \n“interpreter” for other inmates at medical appointments and other critical proceedings, even if he \ndid not want to do so, compromising the confidentiality of the proceedings and potentially \nviolating  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA),  and  creating \npossible security risks.  \n30.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters. When Mr. Stephans first arrived to the \nFDOC in October 2013, he had a series of medical and psychological screenings at Central \nFlorida Reception Center (CFRC), an FDOC prison.  No ASL interpreter was provided to him, \nand he could therefore not adequately communicate with the nurses.  The nurses attempted to \ncommunicate with him by writing notes, but they were ineffective.  \n31.  While  at  CFRC,  on  October  4,  2013,  Mr.  Stephans  filed  a  Reasonable \nModification or Accommodation Request (RMAR).  He wrote, “cannot hear instructions.  Do not \n                         \n2 American Sign Language (ASL) is a language composed of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body move-\nments.  It is the predominant sign language used in the United States.  Although many ASL signs are borrowed from \nEnglish words, ASL is not a word-for-word translation of any particular spoken language, and does not follow Eng-\nlish grammar rules.   \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 12 of 123\nunderstand what I am being told. Getting in trouble because I cannot follow instructions[,] I \ncannot hear.”  He asked for an ASL interpreter to assist him and to be provided with hearing \naids.  His request was denied, and the FDOC staff member wrote on the response, “[Inmate] \ncannot request accommodation until permanent status.”  \n32.  Compounding the problem, for the 22 days Mr. Stephans was at CFRC, both of \nhis hearing aids were not functioning because the batteries were not working and he was refused \nworking batteries.  Mr. Stephans was transferred to Marion Correctional Institution on October \n23, 2013, and still he did not receive batteries until three months later, around January 2014. \n33.  Mr. Stephans was never provided with an interpreter at Marion C.I. for medical, \npsychological, and classification appointments.  Mr. Stephans has also been denied an interpreter \nat religious services. \n34.  While at Marion, Mr. Stephans attended GED classes for twelve months.  He was \nnot provided an ASL interpreter for the classes.  On April 21, 2014, Mr. Stephans filed a \ngrievance requesting an ASL interpreter for his GED class and also for a class on fatherhood.  \nFDOC’s response was to “advise the Education Supervisor regarding this [] issue.”  However, \nnothing was done.  Because he was unable to make any progress without an interpreter, Mr. \nStephans dropped the course and was not able to earn his GED. \n35.  In June 2015, Mr. Stephans attended a transitional skills class that is mandatory \nfor prisoners being released.  Though he asked for an interpreter, no interpreter was provided to \nhim.  Mr. Stephans was given a book for the class, which he only partially understood.  Nothing \nabout Mr. Stephans’s release from prison was explained to him in a way he could understand; he \nwas not provided an ASL interpreter to communicate to him information about his release and \nwhat would be required of him following his release. \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 13 of 123\n36.  Because staff at Marion C.I. have refused to provide qualified ASL interpreters \nfor deaf prisoners, Mr. Stephans became the de facto interpreter, despite him not being a certified \nASL interpreter, his limitations with English, and his inability to hear.  While incarcerated, Mr. \nStephans was asked to interpret on a near-daily basis and was also routinely ordered to interpret \nfor deaf prisoners at their medical appointments.  Mr. Stephans was once threatened with a \nDisciplinary Report (DR) if he did not interpret.   \n37.  On March 25, 2014, Mr. Stephans filed a formal grievance complaining that \nanother  inmate,  Michael  Boggs,  did  not  have  an  ASL  interpreter  at  a  recent  medical \nappointment, and that the nurse was rude to him.  Mr. Stephans observed this himself because he \nhad been ordered to “interpret” at the appointment.  The grievance was denied on April 16, \nstating in part, “Interpreter services are not required for sick call.” \n38.  In June 2015, Mr. Stephans received a DR for an incident that occurred while he \nwas sleepwalking.  At the hearing, Mr. Stephans was not provided with an ASL interpreter and, \nthus, could not adequately defend himself against the DR. \n39.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Stephans’s request for \ninterpreters.  \n40.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  On April 23, 2014, Mr. \nStephans filed a grievance asking the officers in the dorm to flash the lights when announcing \nsuch  activities.    The  FDOC  responded  on  May  9,  2014,  stating  that  the  matter  had  been \ndiscussed, and that staff would be notified of the need to accommodate the population.  \n41.  Following his grievance, some officers have started to flash lights but others do \nnot.  Moreover, officers generally do not announce in writing to deaf and hard of hearing \nprisoners what they are verbally ordering.  As a result, Mr. Stephans has missed meals and head \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 14 of 123\ncounts.  \n42.  In addition, instead of being woken up by an adequate announcement, flashing \nlights, or vibrating watch, Mr. Stephans was woken up every morning by an officer roughly \nkicking his bed. \n43.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Stephans’s request for \nadequate alerts.   \n44.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  On October 29, 2013, \nMr. Stephans filed a formal grievance complaining that the TTY phone did not connect with \nfamily members, and asked for the FDOC to install video phones.  It was returned without \naction.   \n45.  In November and December of 2013, the TTY phone at Marion was not working.  \nMr. Stephans filed five grievances concerning FDOC’s failure to provide him with a working \nTTY; the responses stated that the TTY should be working and that Securus, the company that \ncontracts with the FDOC to operate the inmate phone system, had been notified.  \n46.  Compounding  the  problem,  in  December  2013,  Mr.  Stephans  and  the  other \nhearing impaired inmates in his dorm were repeatedly denied physical access to the TTY phone.  \nThe phone was located in the officers’ station, and officers were not permitting inmates to use \nthe phone when requested.  Mr. Stephans filed a grievance about this on December 15, 2013.  \nThe response was that the issue was being investigated and would be taken care of. \n47.  In April 2014, Mr. Stephans grieved three times that he was unable to use the \nprison TTY to communicate with deaf family members who were also TTY users, and was also \nunable to communicate with deaf family members who were videophone users.  Nothing was \ndone and Mr. Stephans grieved the TTY-to-TTY issue again in May, June, July, and August.  \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 15 of 123\nMr. Stephans appealed the denial of his grievances in September. \n48.  On March 6, 2014, Mr. Stephans filed a grievance complaining about the high \ncosts of the TTY phones.  He filed at least fourteen grievances on the high costs of the TTY, \nemphasizing that TTY users are doubly burdened, because the cost per minute is higher than the \nvoice phone and TTY calls are inherently longer due to the slowness of the relay service.   \n49.  On May 12, 2014, Mr. Stephans filed a request, complaining that they only had 15 \nminutes to use the TTY phone, and asking for the time to be extended. The response stated that \nhe would be provided with the amount of time allotted by the policy.3 \n50.  The FDOC maintains a TIPS line, which is a toll free number that prisoners can \ncall to anonymously report sexual assaults or other problems.  On December 23, 2013, Mr. \nStephans filed a grievance complaining that he could not dial this number on the TTY phone.  \nThe grievance was returned, stating that Tallahassee was working on it.  In March 2014, Mr. \nStephans filed a complaint with the Inspector General’s Office, stating that are multiple deaf or \nhard of hearing inmates at Marion that cannot make complaints on the TIPS line through the \nTTY.  On March 14, he was interviewed by an investigator from the Inspector General’s Office.  \nNo ASL interpreter was provided at this interview, and the interview was conducted with the aid \nof  writing  questions  and  answers.    The  Inspector  General’s  Office  referred  the  issue  to \n“management.”   \n51.  In March 2014, Mr. Stephans also filed a grievance complaining that the TTY \nphone did not allow calls made to the TIPS line.  The FDOC responded on April 21: “The TIPS \nline currently does not work with the TTY and Tallahassee is aware of this situation and are \n                         \n3 There is actually a conflict in FDOC policy on this point. The Florida Administrative Code provision limits TTY \ncalls to 30 minutes, which is double the time allotted for the voice phone.  See F.A.C. 33-602.205(2)(e) & 15(b).  \nBut the FDOC Procedure on ADA provisions allows TTY calls to be three times as long as voice calls.  See FDOC \nProcedure 604.101(3)(b).4.b.v (page 10).   \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 16 of 123\nattempting to rectify it.”  On April 21, 2014, Mr. Stephans filed another grievance complaining \nthat the TIPS line could still not be called on the TTY phone.  The grievance was approved on \nMay 9, passing on instructions from Securus on how to dial the TIPS line. \n52.  While FDOC eventually provided access to the TIPS line for TTY users, a poster \nwith instructions on how to access the TIPS line from the TTY was taken down in mid-2015. \n53.  Engaging  in  Retaliation  and  Interference.    Mr.  Stephans  was  threatened  by \nsecurity staff because he complained about having to serve as an interpreter for other prisoners.  \nThe staff member threatened him with a Disciplinary Report if he did not comply.   \nDavid Stanley \n54.  David Stanley is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has neurosensorial hearing loss in both ears, which substantially limits one or more major life \nactivity, including but not limited to hearing.   He can hear some sounds, but can only understand \npeople talking if he’s looking directly at their face.  He can read lips, but not very well.  He can \nsign the manual alphabet but does not know ASL very well.  He requires the use of two hearing \naids to be able to effectively access the programs, services, and activities of the FDOC.   \n55.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services. For years, the FDOC has failed to \nprovide  Mr.  Stanley  with  his  needed  hearing  aids,  and  has  subjected  him  to  a  years-long \ncampaign of false information and unnecessary obstacles that prevented him from promptly \nreceiving an operable hearing aid.  In July 2009, his hearing aid was sent out for repair, and for \nmuch of the time since he has been without one.  He initially grieved the issue in August 2009, \ncomplaining that he could not hear other inmates and staff.  The response stated that his hearing \naid was beyond repair and that he was going to be sent to Reception and Medical Center (RMC) \nfor a new hearing aid fitting.  At some point he received a new hearing aid, but in June 2010 the \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 17 of 123\nbattery died. He submitted a grievance about it, and he was told that batteries were being \nordered.  \n56.  In October 2011, Mr. Stanley’s left hearing aid broke.  Mr. Stanley did not receive \nanother left hearing aid for nearly three years.  While waiting to receive a new, left hearing aid, \nMr. Stanley’s right hearing aid malfunctioned several times, leaving him completely without \nhearing for periods as long as 35 days.  In January 2012, he saw a hearing aid specialist to be \nfitted for a new left hearing aid.  By March, Mr. Stanley had not received it, so he filed a \ngrievance.  The response was that someone would look into it.  In April, he filed a request asking \nfor a status update.  He was again told that someone would check on it.  \n57.  Another audiology consult was requested in May 2012.  In June, Mr. Stanley filed \nanother grievance about the issue.  By June 22, the FDOC could still not figure out whether Mr. \nStanley had received his hearing aid:  A notation was made by an FDOC employee at Utilization \nManagement (UM), asking if Mr. Stanley had a hearing aid.   Another note was entered on July \n24, confirming that Mr. Stanley did not have his hearing aid that was issued in 2010, and \nindicating a call had been placed to the prison to verify his story.  The employee then denigrated \nthe credibility of all prisoners:  “The fact ‘he says this’ ‘he says that’ is not worth anything in the \ngrand scheme of things. . . . AS we know, I/M’s [inmates] are not reliable.”   \n58.  On  June  28,  2012,  Mr.  Stanley  filed  yet  another  grievance  asking  about  his \nhearing aid.  The response stated that the doctor said the hearing aid was too old to be repaired, \nand they thought Mr. Stanley already had a hearing aid.  He appealed this decision, informing \nthem that he in fact did not have his hearing aid, but the FDOC still did not believe him. The \ngrievance was denied in July, stating: “all documentation suggests you were given back your \nhearing aid, issued in 2010, while at FSP.  Hearing aids are only issued ever[y] 4 years.”   \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 18 of 123\n59.  Mr. Stanley continued to raise the issue, and in September 2012 a staff member at \nTomoka emailed an employee at UM to say that that doctor confirmed that his right hearing aid \nwas damaged beyond repair and needed replacement.  That request was denied.   \n60.  In October 2012, Mr. Stanley filed another request for the status of his hearing \naid.  In November he was given the same response that defied reality:  “Beltone states the \nhearing aid you went with was too old for repair. You were also given one in 2012.”  He \nappealed, noting that he did not receive a hearing aid in 2012, and that the one he gave the \nmedical department had not been returned.  It was denied, saying he was not eligible for another \nhearing aid at that time.  He appealed, which was also denied in December, stating: “You have \npreviously been advised you do not meet the criteria for another hearing aid at this time.  Ms. \nPapp spoke with FSP and they advised they did not have your hearing aid, nor did they send it \nout for repair.” \n61.  On December 3, 2012, Mr. Stanley was called to the medical department, and the \nnurse told him to submit a request to be sent to RMC to be fitted for a new hearing aid tube.  He \ndid so on December 6.  The response said to watch the call out list and bring the hearing aid with \nhim.  But when he showed up for the call out, no one was there. He filed a request on December \n17, pointing this out.  The response was that he was scheduled to discuss the matter on December \n20.  In the interim, he appealed the initial response.  The appeal was denied on January 29, 2013, \nstating, “It is the responsibility of the CHO [Chief Health Officer] to determine the appropriate \ntreatment regimen for the condition you are experiencing including passes and assignment of a \nhearing aid.”  \n62.  By April 2013, nearly two years after his hearing aid broke, he had still not been \nto RMC for the fitting, and submitted yet another request.  The response was that he had to see a \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 19 of 123\nphysician so a consult could be completed, and instructed him to access sick call.  He appealed.  \nThe appeal was denied.  On April 22, he filed a formal grievance.  It was denied with similar \nlanguage.  He appealed again, and the final denial came on June 13, 2013.   \n63.  Mr. Stanley immediately filed a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation \nRequest asking for a hearing aid.  It was denied on June 29, instructing him to access sick call.   \nHe appealed, saying he already went to sick call.  The appeal was denied on August 5.  Mr. \nStanley appealed again.  Finally, on October 25, the appeal was approved, saying he would be \nseen by an audiologist for a hearing aid evaluation, giving the institution 30 days to implement \nthe action. \n64.  Predictably, the institution did not comply.  On December 1, 2013, Mr. Stanley \nfiled Emergency Grievance to the Secretary because he still had not seen audiologist.  It was \nreturned without action on January 3, 2014.   \n65.  Mr. Stanley finally saw a hearing aid specialist on December 30, 2013, over three \nyears since his hearing aid broke.   The specialist told him that his hearing aid would be ready in \n2-4 weeks.  Of course, four weeks came and went without a hearing aid.  On March 30, 2014, he \nfiled a request asking about it.  The institution responded, saying they were waiting for RMC, \nstating “This takes a long time, unfortunately.”  On April 4, 2014, he submitted a grievance \nexplaining that he had been waiting for his hearing aid to come back from repair since 2011.  \nThe response accused him of filing a duplicate grievance.  He appealed, and response stated that \nmedication renewal was not automatic, and that he would have to access sick call.  He appealed \nagain, and the final response came on June 9, 2014, advising him that his appointment at RMC \nhad been rescheduled. That same day, Mr. Stanley was permitted to go to RMC to obtain his left \nhearing aid.   \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 20 of 123\n66.  After obtaining his left hearing aid, Mr. Stanley sought to have his right hearing \naid repaired on June 24, 2015.  He submitted it to medical staff at Tomoka to repair the volume \ncontrol and circuit board.  Mr. Stanley received his right hearing aid back a full month later, on \nAugust 25, 2015, and the volume control was still broken, which makes the device ineffective.    \n67.  Numerous other prisoners have undergone similarly long and unjustified delays in \nattempting to obtain hearing aids and other assistive devices.   \n68.  In January 2015, Mr. Stanley filed a grievance asking for hearing amplifiers.  Mr. \nStanley would like to have hearing amplifiers to assist him with hearing, particularly when his \nhearing aids go out for repair for months at a time.  Mr. Stanley did not receive a response to his \ngrievance.    \n69.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Stanley’s request for \nhearing aids and other devices.  \nRay Spears \n70.  Ray Spears is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  He \nis deaf and cannot communicate verbally with spoken English, which substantially limits one or \nmore major life activity, including but not limited to hearing and speaking.  His primary method \nof communication is ASL.  Mr. Spears cannot write in English and can only partially read \nEnglish.   Mr. Spears has been forced to seek the assistance of other prisoners to write grievances \nfor him.   \n71.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.   Since 2003, Mr. Spears has been \nincarcerated  at  South  Florida  Reception  Center,  Okaloosa  Correctional  Institution,  Dade \nCorrectional  Institution,  and  Tomoka  Correctional  Institution.    Although  he  has  had  many \nmedical, classification, and mental health appointment at these prisons, he was very rarely \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 21 of 123\nprovided with an interpreter.  Occasionally, staff attempted to communicate with him by writing \nnotes, but Mr. Spears could only partially understand what was being communicated to him.     \n72.  Mr. Spears has been experiencing back pain for the last four years.  Because he \nhas never been provided with a qualified interpreter at his medical appointments during this time, \nMr. Spears was reduced to communicating with Tomoka medical staff by pointing to where the \npain is and making a face.  Because of the communication barrier, medical staff have been \nunable to diagnose or treat Mr. Spear’s medical problem.  Mr. Spears went to sick call several \ntimes to try to get treatment for this problem, but became frustrated because medical staff \ncouldn’t understand him so he stopped going.   \n73.  Mr. Spears attends church and no qualified ASL interpreter is provided for him.  \nOnce a month, a volunteer comes to conduct the service in ASL; however, on days when the \nvolunteer is absent, Mr. Spears cannot understand the church service. \n74.  Mr. Spears would like to learn how to read English better and would like to learn \nhow to write English.  Mr. Spears would attend and would have attended educational programing \nwhile in prison if a qualified interpreter was available. \n75.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Spears’s  request  for \ninterpreters.  \nMichael Boggs \n76.  Michael Boggs is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe is deaf and cannot communicate verbally with spoken English, which substantially limits one \nor more major life activity, including but not limited to hearing and speaking. His primary \nmethod of communication is ASL.  FDOC knows that Mr. Boggs is deaf and is in need of \nservices  related  to  his  disability.  For  instance,  Mr.  Boggs’  Classification  Summary,  dated \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 22 of 123\nJanuary 12, 2012, states that, “Inmate is deaf and does not read lips” and his February 2, 2012 \nHealth Services Profile notes that Mr. Boggs is in need of impaired inmate services.    \n77.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  Mr. Boggs was processed at Central \nFlorida Reception Center (CFRC) in 2012.  He was not provided with an ASL interpreter during \nthat processing, and therefore did not understand what he was told.   \n78.  Mr. Boggs was assaulted by other prisoners while at CFRC.  When he attempted \nto get medical help following his assault, without an ASL interpreter, medical staff at CFRC \nrefused to treat his injuries.  Medical staff wrote down notes to him communicating that nothing \nwas wrong with him.  Officers laughed at Mr. Boggs when he tried to correct the medical staff.  \nThere was not effective communication at the medical appointment.  \n79.  Mr. Boggs was transferred from CFRC to Marion C.I. in 2012.  Mr. Boggs has \nnot been provided with a qualified ASL interpreter for classification appointments at Marion.  In \norder to communicate, he passes notes during such appointments, which are not effective.   \n80.  Mr. Boggs has not been provided with a qualified interpreter at church.  He still \nattends church but is limited to watching the services and cannot fully participate due to the lack \nof an interpreter. \n81.  Mr. Boggs has also not been provided with qualified interpreters at his medical \nand dental appointments at Marion.  Medical staff write notes to communicate with him but Mr. \nBoggs doesn’t understand their writing.  Dental work is painful for Mr. Boggs, in large part \nbecause he cannot express his pain level to the dentist.  Mr. Boggs avoids going to the dentist \nbecause of these issues.  \n82.  Mr. Boggs suffers from pain in his back, head, and teeth, which is not being \ntreated by medical staff at Marion.  Mr. Boggs’s back has been hurting him since December \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 23 of 123\n2012, when he lifted something heavy, felt severe pain in his back, and couldn’t move or walk \nfor some time.  Mr. Boggs routinely pays $5 to go to sick call to seek treatment, and finds that \nthe medical staff cannot communicate with him or treat him.  Often, medical staff do not even \nattempt to communicate with Mr. Boggs and chat with the officers instead of communicating \nwith him.  Mr. Boggs goes to sick call every month despite the communication barriers because \nhe doesn’t want his injuries and medical issues to be left untreated.  However, Mr. Boggs is \ndenied treatment due to the failure to provide an ASL interpreter for him.   \n83.  In July 2012, Mr. Boggs began attending GED classes at Marion Correctional \nInstitution.    He wanted to earn his GED because it was a prerequisite to the electrician’s course \nat Marion.  When he first enrolled in the classes, an outside volunteer who was learning ASL \nassisted Mr. Boggs for four or five months.  The volunteer left in fall of 2012.   \n84.  Mr. Boggs went an entire year without being provided an interpreter for his GED \nclasses,  despite  repeatedly  requesting  one.    He  did  not  understand  the  instructor  who  was \nspeaking to him without an interpreter and was even reprimanded for not following directions \nthat he couldn’t understand.   \n85.  On  July  16,  2013,  Mr.  Boggs  was  issued  a  Disciplinary  Report  (DR)  for \nDisobeying an Order.  He was not provided with an ASL interpreter at the hearing for the DR.  \nHe was punished with 30 days probation and lost eight days of gain time. \n86.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Boggs’s  request  for \ninterpreters. \n87.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Mr. Boggs requires two hearing \naids.  One broke in 2014 while Mr. Boggs was incarcerated at Gainesville Work Camp.  Mr. \nBoggs went to sick call, filled out a form, and was charged $5 to have the hearing aid fixed.  Mr. \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 24 of 123\nBoggs did not receive his hearing aid back for six months.  However, once returned the hearing \naid still did not work, and when Mr. Boggs attempted to use it, he got a headache.  FDOC failed \nto provide Mr. Boggs with a follow-up appointment to fix the hearing aid and thus has denied \nMr. Boggs use of an operable hearing aid. \n88.  The FDOC imposed an illegal surcharge on Mr. Boggs to obtain his hearing aid.  \n89.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Boggs’s  request  for \nhearing aids. \n90.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs. Mr. Boggs was incarcerated at Gainesville \nWork Camp for six months, beginning in March of 2014 and ending on August 3, 2014.  During \nthis  time,  he  applied  for  work  release  programs  and  was  turned  down  each  time.    Upon \ninformation and belief, he was turned down because he is deaf.   \n91.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  It is more expensive for \nMr. Boggs to communicate with family and friends than it is for inmates who are not deaf. For \nexample, in 2012, Mr. Boggs requested that FDOC address the issue that individuals using a \nTTY or placing a relay call are required to pay a higher fee per minute than the general inmate \nphone.  He was told that it would be looked into but that, until then, he would need to pay \nadditional charges.  Mr. Boggs filed a grievance on June 16, 2012, with those allegations.  The \ngrievance was denied.  The institution responded that it is an issue with the carrier and that there \nis nothing further they can add to their previous response.        \n92.  Not only has it been more expensive for Mr. Boggs to communicate with his \nfamily and friends outside of the institution, there have been periods of time where it was \nimpossible.  On October 31, 2013, while at Marion Correctional Institution, Mr. Boggs filed an \nInmate Request reporting that the TTY had not been working since January. Mr. Boggs was \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 25 of 123\nadvised to contact the dormitory supervisor and inform them of the problem.  The problem was \nnot  remedied. In November 2013 and again in December 2013, Mr. Boggs submitted two \nadditional Inmate Requests regarding the same issue.  Mr. Boggs was then instructed to request \nuse of the TTY from the correctional officers.  However, on December 15, 2013, Mr. Boggs \nsubmitted  another  Inmate  Request  stating  that  when  he  requested  the  use  of  a  TTY,  the \ncorrectional officers responded that they were “not sure of it.”  The institution assured Mr. Boggs \nthat the issue would be investigated and taken care of.  Nonetheless, in February 2014, he alerted \nthe institution again that the problems with the TTY persisted.   \n93.  On December 11, 2013, Mr. Boggs reported that the sexual abuse hotline was not \nfunctioning via use of the TTY.  The deaf and hard of hearing prisoners ultimately reported this \nto an outside advocacy group.  \nLewis Parker \n94.  Lewis Parker is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has conductive and sensoneurial hearing loss, and tinnitus.4  He has been declared hearing \nimpaired by the FDOC, and was issued a hearing aid.  His impairment substantially limits one or \nmore major life activity, including but not limited to hearing.   When he has his hearing aid, he \ncan hear fairly well.  When he doesn’t (which is most of the time in the FDOC), he can only hear \nsomeone talking if he can look right at them and see their lips, and there is no ambient noise.  He \nhas not had his hearing aid for some time because the FDOC has failed to repair or replace it in a \ntimely fashion.    \n95.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  In November 2010, Mr. Parker \nfiled a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Request (RMAR) asking for large cup-style \n                         \n4 Tinnitus is commonly described as a ringing in the ears, but it also can sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or \nbuzzing. It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched and can be present in either one or both ears.  See \nhttp://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/Pages/tinnitus.aspx#1 (Last visited January 18, 2016). \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 26 of 123\nheadphones  because  the  institutional  headphones  caused  high  frequency  feedback  with  his \nhearing aid.   It was initially denied.  After seeing Dr. Calderon, the Chief Health Officer at \nTomoka, Mr. Parker filed another grievance in December 2010 informing the prison that Dr. \nCalderon said that he couldn’t find anything in his file showing that Mr. Parker had hearing aids.  \nMr. Parker said this was not possible and asked to be reevaluated.  An audiologist consult was \nrecommended by a doctor, which was denied by FDOC on January 5, 2011, stating, “No clear \ndocumentation  of  medical  necessity.”    However,  on  January  10,  Mr.  Parker’s  request  was \ngranted, after he fought for months to prove that he was hard of hearing.  \n96.  More recently, at Tomoka C.I., Mr. Parker had headphones that worked with a \nvolume booster so that he could hear his radio.  However, the headphones were confiscated when \nhe  was  transferred  to  Sumter  C.I.    He  currently  does  not  have  a  pair  of  headphones  that \naccommodate  his  hearing  loss,  and  thus  cannot  hear  the  radio.    He  filed  a  Reasonable \nModification or Accommodation Request in approximately April 2015 asking for a volume \nbooster, but was told that he could only have it if he could pay for it himself.  He cannot afford it \nat this time.  Forcing Mr. Parker to pay for an auxiliary aid operates as an illegal surcharge.   \n97.  Mr. Parker has also experienced numerous ongoing problems with receiving and \nmaintaining his needed hearing aid.  On October 24, 2012, Mr. Parker turned in his hearing aid \nfor repair.  On November 30, he was informed that the hearing aid had still not been repaired.  \nHe tried to explain that he needed his hearing aid and that he was getting yelled at by staff \nbecause he wasn’t responding.   He spoke again with Ms. Stern on January 9, 2013, and was \ninformed that they were awaiting an appointment to get his hearing aid.  He filed a formal \ngrievance about it on January 23.  The response approved the grievance, stating “your hearing \naid was mailed out to be repaired as soon as you gave it to medical.  However, after speaking \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 27 of 123\nwith Hearing Care Resources they have advised that they never received it in the mail.  A new \nConsult has been written and submitted to UM for approval.”    \n98.  Mr. Parker saw the audiologist on March 11, 2013, where a new mold was taken \nfor a hearing aid.  He received his hearing aid shortly after that.  During the time he was without \nhis hearing aid, his bed was next to a large exhaust fan, and he could not hear voices most of the \ntime.  He missed two or three appointments or other meetings per week because he could not \nhear the call-out.     \n99.  FDOC also failed to properly accommodate Mr. Parker during a disciplinary \nhearing.  On November 6, 2012, Mr. Parker received a Disciplinary Report (DR) for fighting.  \nOn November 13, a DR hearing was held without any accommodation and without ensuring that \nMr. Parker could understand and participate in the proceedings.  In the middle of the reading of \nthe statement of facts, Classification Officer Mr. Melton left the hearing and announced that it \nhad to be postponed because Mr. Parker was deaf.  But on November 15, the hearing resumed \nwith a new team, again without any accommodation.  Because Mr. Parker did not have his \nhearing aid, he could not hear what was happening because the hearing officer and guards were \nnot speaking directly at him.  Mr. Parker was found guilty and sentenced to 20 days disciplinary \nconfinement.   \n100.  Mr. Parker immediately filed a grievance, which was denied on December 18.  He \nappealed, and on February 24, 2013, Mr. Parker was notified that the DR was being overturned \nbecause the Warden found that he did not actually commit the infraction.  By that point, of \ncourse, Mr. Parker had already served his 20 day sentence in disciplinary confinement. \n101.  Several months ago, Mr. Parker’s hearing aid broke because the tube ruptured.  \nHe turned it in for repair, but the FDOC kept it for four months, then returned it to him without \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 28 of 123\nrepairing it.  He has requested that the FDOC repair or replace it, but the FDOC has not done so. \n102.  Mr. Parker receives a daily insulin injection in the medical department.  Without \nhis hearing aid, he cannot understand what medical staff are telling him, unless they are looking \ndirectly at him, which they rarely do.  He tries his best to just follow along.  On one occasion, he \nwas almost given the wrong insulin injection because he could not understand what the nurse \nwas saying.  Thankfully, he noticed the bottle and was able to stop the nurse before he was \nimproperly injected. \n103.  Mr. Parker cannot watch television at Everglades C.I., where he is currently \nhoused.  Sometimes there is closed captioning on the television, but the other prisoners don’t like \nseeing the captions, so they turn it off with the remote.  The televisions also do not have \ntransmitters that transmit the television audio over the radio waves, which can be picked up by a \nhearing aid paired with a special device.  If he had his hearing aid and had the proper equipment, \nand the televisions had transmitters, he would be able to hear the television.  \n104.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Parker’s  request  for \nhearing aids and other devices. \n105.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  Several years ago while at \nTomoka C.I., Mr. Parker had a vibrating watch to wake him up in the morning, because he \ncannot hear an alarm clock.  Unfortunately, when he was transferred to Sumter C.I. two years \nago, it was confiscated by staff.  Since then, he has missed approximately 30 appointments \nbecause he has not woken up in time, or was sleeping when he was called out and no one came \nto wake him.   \n106.  There are no flashing lights in Mr. Parker’s dorm to alert deaf and hard of hearing \nprisoners about critical events such as count, going to the dining hall, recreation, or emergency \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 29 of 123\nevacuations.  The officers expect Mr. Parker to listen when spoken to, even though he frequently \ncannot hear them without his hearing aid.  The officers get upset and curse at him when he does \nnot respond to their commands, and he is subject to disciplinary action for failing to follow \norders.   \n107.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Parker’s request for alerts. \n108.  Failure  to  Provide  Effective  Telecommunications  Access.    Throughout  his \nincarceration, Mr. Parker has kept in close contact with his wife and other family members.  \nWhen  given  the  proper  equipment  and  accommodations,  he  and  his  wife  talk  frequently \n(sometimes once a day).  However, his efforts to remain in contact with his wife have been \nstymied in recent years by the FDOC’s failure to sure ensure equitable phone access.   \n109.  There is no TTY at Everglades C.I. that Mr. Parker can access.  Mr. Parker can \nuse the voice phone if he turns the volume all the way up and his wife (his most frequent caller) \nyells into the phone.  There was a TTY at Sumter C.I., but it was portable, and prisoners were \nrequired to reserve it ahead of time with the officers.  Frequently, the officers did not produce the \nTTY in a timely fashion, and sometimes did not produce it at all.  In contrast, prisoners with no \nhearing loss could use the wall phones at almost any times, without delay.  Moreover, at Sumter, \nthe voice phone was located next to a loud exhaust fan, which made it impossible for Mr. Parker \nto use.  \n110.  Engaging in Retaliation and Interference.  Upon information and belief, since \nPlaintiff began investigating the violations within the FDOC, the FDOC began holding ADA \nreview meetings.  Mr. Parker has attended one or two of them, but before the meetings it was \nmade clear to him that he was not permitted to raise any issues during the meeting.  After the \nmeeting, prisoners are forced to sign refusal forms, ostensibly to confirm that they have no \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 30 of 123\npending ADA issues.  \nDaniel Edwards \n111.  Daniel Edwards is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has severe hearing loss in both ears, which substantially limits one or more major life \nactivity, including but not limited to hearing.  Mr. Edwards requires the use of two hearing aids. \nMr. Edwards’s mother is also hearing impaired and he has attempted to communicate with her \nregularly throughout his incarceration.  \n112.  Failure  to  Provide  Effective  Telecommunications  Access.  Mr.  Edwards  has \nreported issues with access to the TTY for several years.  On October 4, 2011, Mr. Edwards filed \na grievance at Tomoka C.I. claiming that hearing impaired individuals are being charged a much \nhigher rate than non-deaf individuals to place phone calls.  Mr. Edwards used an example of a \nnine minute call to New York on the TTY that cost Mr. Edwards’s mother $23.99.  Mr. Edwards \nstated that the same call would cost roughly $2.00 for a non-deaf inmate and he attached his \nphone bill as an exhibit.   \n113.  On October 11, 2011, his grievance was denied, with the FDOC blaming Securus \nand  other  carriers.    Mr.  Edwards  appealed  this  grievance  and  emphasized  that  he  is  not \nconcerned with Securus’s contractual obligation, stating that, “The simple fact is that FDOC \nprovides the telecommunication service to inmates and FDOC is responsible for ensuring this \nservice of provided without violating the law.”  His grievance was again denied.  \n114.  On May 13, 2012, Mr. Edwards reported that the TTY had been out of paper for \nmore than 10 days and requests to refill the paper have gone unanswered.  When there is no \npaper  in  the  TTY  deaf  inmates  are  prohibited  from  placing  calls  because  they  can’t  be \n“recorded.”  On May 14, 2012, he reported that the officers had been leaving the TTY paper out \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 31 of 123\non the counter where other inmates have access to their phone conversations and pin numbers.   \n115.  Mr. Edwards, while still at Tomoka, continued to have problems with access to \nthe phone and became increasingly distraught at not being able to communicate with his family.  \nOn May 19, 2013, Mr. Edwards submitted a request regarding being unable to make collect calls \non the TTY line.  The FDOC responded and informed Mr. Edwards that his account is active and \nhis family must resolve that issue and that it is “their decision to accept collect calls.”  On May \n27, 2013, Mr. Edwards submitted an additional request clarifying that his family does not have a \ncollect call block on their phone but his calls were still not going through.  His request was \nreturned and he was advised that his family needed to contact the phone company.  Mr. Edwards \nrequested again that FDOC look into why he is unable to make calls on the TTY and on June 5, \n2013, was again told that the calls are being blocked by the phone company.   \n116.  On July 16, 2013, Classification Officer Julia Mead exchanged an e-mail with a \nrepresentative from Securus that stated, “I hate to bother you but this one is driving me crazy!  \nHe is hearing impaired and so is his mother… he uses the regular phone when he can (when the \ndorm is quiet) but has approval to use the TDY also.”  According to Ms. Mead, Mr. Edwards’ \nmother’s number goes through on the voice phone but not the TTY.  The Securus representative \nresponded that Securus has nothing to do with billing and it’s a matter of personal preference.  \n117.  Determined to be able to communicate with his family, Mr. Edwards continued to \nseek assistance in getting access to the phone.  On February 9, 2014, Mr. Edwards submitted an \ninmate request to the classification department at Tomoka Correctional Institution and attempted \nto explain his position again.  Mr. Edwards reported that no collect calls can be made from the \nTTY phone. The FDOC responded that they received a response from the Securus representative \nwho stated that they have nothing to do with the TTY billing and that it is up to the individual \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 32 of 123\ncarrier.  Mr. Edwards appealed this response and his appeal was denied on March 5, 2014, \nwherein he was informed that Securus and FDOC have no control over TTY billing.  Mr. \nEdwards again appealed and his appeal was sent to FDOC’s Bureau of Contract Management \n(BCM).  BCM replied, “Florida Relay System (FRS) is a 3rd Party Provider of Relay Service to \nFlorida constituents, fully independent of Securus…Securus simply provides access to FRS \nplatform and operators.  From a Securus perspective, these are not collect calls, they’re toll free \ncalls.  Once the call connects to the FRS operator, Securus loses full control of the call except re: \nrecording and timing.”  Mr. Edwards was again directed to have the person he is trying to call \ncontact their carrier and determine if there is any resolution for this issue.     \n118.  Since March 2013, when he was still incarcerated at Tomoka and for the last year \nat Marion C.I., Mr. Edwards has been unable to use the TTY.  When he last tried to use the TTY \nin March of 2013, his calls would not go through.   \n119.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services. While Mr. Edwards requires the \nuse of two hearing aids – one for each ear – as of September 2015, FDOC has only ever allowed \nhim to have one hearing aid at a time.  Mr. Edwards has needed to use two hearing aids since he \nwas 16 years old. \n120.  In 2009 or 2010, the one hearing aid he had fell apart.  Mr. Edwards did not \nreceive another hearing aid until 2012, this time for his left ear. \n121.  On May 2, 2011, Mr. Edwards submitted a request to the medical department at \nTomoka Correctional Institution regarding his broken hearing aid and his need for two new ones.  \nMr. Edwards was told to use his routine access to sick call.  He was ultimately able to obtain a \nconsultation.   The June 15, 2011, Consultation Request/Consultant’s Report stated that, “Inmate \nis a 43 year old male with a history of hearing loss who received a hearing aid on 4/2004 not \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 33 of 123\nreparable.  Please evaluate and advise if he needs a new hearing aid.”  On July 18, 2011, Mr. \nEdwards went for an appointment and was found to have a totally occluded ear canal.  A \ncerumenectomy (the removal of extensive earwax) was recommended and completed.  Finally, \non December 28, 2011, Mr. Edwards was approved for just one hearing aid, again, even though \nhe has documented severe hearing loss in both ears.  Mr. Edwards received his left hearing aid in \n2012.   \n122.  Mr. Edwards went to another audiology appointment in November 2014, this time \nto be fitted for a right hearing aid.  However, before he received the right hearing aid in May of \n2015, his left hearing aid broke – the volume dial stopped working, causing Mr. Edwards to \nconstantly hear static noise.  FDOC sent his left hearing aid out for repair in August 2015.  Mr. \nEdwards is hopeful that he may have two functional hearing aids when his left hearing aid is \nreturned, which would be the first time in his 13-and-a-half years in prison.    \n123.  In addition to hearing aids, Mr. Edwards also needs hearing related devices in \norder to have equal access to programs, services and activities.  For example, On February 21, \n2010 while at Polk Correctional Institution, Mr. Edwards requested a higher volume radio and \nheadphones.    His  request  was  “noted.”    He  submitted  a  Reasonable  Modification  or \nAccommodation Request in April 2010 regarding these same devices.  His request was denied \nand he was informed that, “At the current time, we have no provisions for an amplified radio and \nyou are asking for a high decibel radio without advising how it differs from the canteen radios in \ndecibels and how it will help you to hear the radio better.  We do have provisions for inmates to \npurchase over the ear headphones if the inmate cannot use the ear buds that come with the \ncanteen radios.  There is nothing in the ADA that requires that we furnish you with an amplified \nradio and headphones.”   \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 34 of 123\n124.  Mr. Edwards filed a formal grievance regarding these same devices and that \ngrievance was denied on May 25, 2010.  He filed a timely appeal of that denial on June 21, 2010.  \nThis appeal was also denied.  Mr. Edwards was told that he needs to contact medical call out and \nexplain the issue to the Chief Health Officer and “If the CHO determines that a hearing test is in \norder then he will request one, it is up to him to make the decision as to whether or not you need \nan auxiliary aid different from those normally offered.  However it should be noted that any \ndevice such as a higher decibel radio is not provided by the Department.  All inmates must \npurchase their own radios.”  \n125.  Finally, while Mr. Edwards resides in a dorm with other hearing-impaired and \ndeaf prisoners, on his side of the dorm, he does not have adequate access to the television.  The \ntelevision  he  is  permitted  to  watch  does  not  have  closed  captioning  and  does  not  have  a \ntransmitter.  Mr. Edwards is not permitted to use the television on the other side of the dorm, \nwhich provides those accommodations.  \n126.  The FDOC’s pattern of failures to make the television accessible to deaf and hard \nof hearing prisoners is further illustrated by other similar lawsuits.  For instance, in previous \nlitigation, the FDOC attempted to avoid the requirements of the ADA by not allowing a prisoner \nto have the necessary equipment to hear the television—a simple hookup to his hearing aid and a \nradio transmitter from the television.  See Garcia v. Tucker, Case No. 4:07-cv-474-SPM/WCS \n(N.D.  Fla.).    After  protracted  litigation, the  FDOC  finally  agreed to  a  settlement  in  2012, \nallowing the prisoner to keep the necessary equipment and to be housed in a facility with a \ntransmitter, and paying a substantial amount in attorneys’ fees.    \n127.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Edwards’s request for \nhearing aids and other devices. \n- 34 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 35 of 123\n128.  The  FDOC  imposed  illegal  surcharges  on  Mr.  Edwards  by  making  him  see \nmedical staff and pay a $5 copayment to obtain an auxiliary aid and service, and by forcing him \nto pay for those aids and services.  \nErnesto Guevara  \n129.  Ernesto Guevara is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \ntimes.  He is deaf and cannot communicate verbally with spoken English, which substantially \nlimits one or more major life activity, including but not limited to hearing and speaking.  His \nprimary method of communication is reading lips in Spanish and his secondary method of \ncommunication is American Sign Language (ASL).  Mr. Guevara can neither read nor write \nEnglish. \n130.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  Mr. Guevara would like to participate \nin educational programming but cannot because he knows that no ASL interpreter will be \nprovided to him.  Mr. Guevara hasn’t been able to participate in any programming while in \nprison because of the lack of ASL interpreters.   \n131.  In September 2015, Mr. Guevara had a medical appointment.  Another inmate \nserved as an “interpreter.”  As a result, the communication was difficult and not confidential.    \n132.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  Mr. Guevara cannot \nuse the TTY because he does not understand English.  Mr. Guevara can communicate in ASL; \nthus, if FDOC provided him with a videophone, he would be able to effectively communicate \nwith his family and friends outside of prison, just as hearing inmates can.  Without a videophone, \nMr. Guevara has been left totally isolated.   \n133.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  In September 2015, Mr. Guevara \nattempted to request a hearing aid at a medical appointment.  Mr. Guevara has previously used \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 36 of 123\nhearing aids.  A hearing aid would permit Mr. Guevara to hear vehicles and other environmental \nsounds, thus affording him more independence and safety in an outdoor work program.  Medical \nstaff at Marion denied his request.   \n134.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Guevara’s request for \nhearing aids and interpreters. \nThomas Jameson \n135.  Thomas Jameson was incarcerated in the FDOC system at all relevant times.  He \nis deaf and cannot communicate verbally with spoken English, which substantially limits one or \nmore major life activity, including but not limited to hearing and speaking. His primary method \nof  communication  is  American  Sign  Language  (ASL).    Mr.  Jameson  has  been  deaf  since \nchildhood.  Mr. Jameson also requires the use of hearing aids in both ears.  \n136.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  Mr. Jameson has gone to sick call for \nmedical and/or dental appointments about six times in the last eight years and has only once been \nprovided with a qualified ASL interpreter.  At times, FDOC has provided Mr. Jameson with a \nqualified ASL interpreter for psychological evaluations and treatment.  At other times, they have \nnot.  For example, on January 27, 2011, a mental health evaluation had to be rescheduled \nbecause the FDOC failed to ensure an interpreter was present.  The FDOC counselor informed \nMr. Jameson that an inmate interpreter could not be used because of “1) HIPAA concerns and 2) \nthey do not satisfy ADA requirements.”  Further, on September 9, 2015, Mr. Jameson was \ndenied a qualified interpreter for a psychological evaluation.  As a result, Mr. Jameson could not \ncommunicate at all during the appointment. \n137.  Mr. Jameson has attended church for the last six years at FDOC and has never \nonce been provided a qualified interpreter. \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 37 of 123\n138.  Mr. Jameson attended GED classes while at Polk C.I.  Before taking the classes, \nMr. Jameson was at a 3rd-grade reading level.  A fellow prisoner who was a former teacher for \nthe deaf interpreted the classes for him and Mr. Jameson’s reading level improved to 5th grade.  \nHowever,  the  prisoner  was  removed  from  his  classes,  and  Mr.  Jameson  could  no  longer \nunderstand any of the materials.  Mr. Jameson was forced to drop the GED classes, never \nattained his GED, and continues to have great difficulty writing English. \n139.  Mr.  Jameson  attended  a  mandatory  transition  skills  course  for  two  weeks  at \nMarion C.I.  He was not provided with an ASL interpreter and did not understand the course. \n140.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Jameson’s request for \ninterpreters.   \n141.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  Mr. Jameson generally \ncannot use the TTY because he has great difficulty writing English.  Sometimes other prisoners \nhelped him use the TTY, but this was difficult and was not confidential.  Mr. Jameson is able to \nsign and understand ASL and would be able to communicate with his friends and family through \na videophone.  But videophones are not provided.   \n142.  On June 8, 2012, Mr. Jameson filed a grievance alleging that the TTY phone calls \nare being over-charged compared to a regular voice call.  The FDOC denied this grievance and \ntold Mr. Jameson that FDOC is aware of the concerns and is working to resolve the issue.  Mr. \nJameson was advised to pay the subject fees.  Mr. Jameson appealed and his grievance was again \ndenied.  Mr. Jameson appealed to the FDOC Secretary and in August 2012, his appeal was \ndenied. \n143.  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Jameson’s  request  for  a \nvideophone.   \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 38 of 123\n144.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  In 2014, one of Mr. Jameson’s \nhearing aids broke and the other hearing aid was lost.  Mr. Jameson saw an audiologist in 2014 at \nJefferson C.I. to be tested and fitted for a hearing aid.   However, Mr. Jameson has not been \nprovided with hearing aids and has been told to wait.  A hearing aid would allow Mr. Jameson to \nhear vehicles or lawn mowers approaching, providing him with needed safety. \n145.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Jameson’s request for \nhearing aids. \n146.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs. On January 20, 2014, Mr. Jameson submitted \nan inmate request regarding his job placement.  He reported that approximately two months \nprior, the FDOC classification department changed his job assignment to the PRIDE5 Garment \nfactory and was told he would start work there in February.  However, when Mr. Jameson had an \ninterview with a Ms. Howard at the PRIDE factory, he was told he could not work there because \nhe is deaf.  \nEdgar Lugo Martinez  \n147.  Edgar Lugo Martinez is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \ntimes.  He is deaf, cannot communicate well with spoken English, cannot lip-read effectively and \ncannot read proficiently, all of which substantially limits several major life activities, including \nbut not limited to hearing and speaking.  His primary method of communication is American \nSign Language (ASL), a language which he has used his whole life.   Mr. Martinez has been deaf \nsince he was nine months old. Mr. Martinez has some minor residual hearing and when he is \nafforded properly fitted and operable hearing aids he can hear some loud noises such as a fire \n                         \n5 Prison Rehabilitative Industries and Diversified Enterprises, Inc. (PRIDE) is a private, nonprofit organization that \noperates job sites within Florida prisons.  It allows prisoners to receive training and work in industrial, manufactur-\ning, and agricultural fields.  See https://www.pride-enterprises.org/content.aspx?page=CompanyOverview (last vis-\nited January 18, 2016).  \n- 38 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 39 of 123\nalarm.  Mr. Martinez has been designated as a deaf impaired inmate by the FDOC, and his \ndeafness and other disabilities are well documented in FDOC records.  Therefore, FDOC has had \nfull knowledge that Mr. Martinez is deaf and uses ASL to communicate. Moreover, he wears a \nbadge every day which says he is HEARING IMPAIRED. \n148.  Failure  to  Provide  Qualified  Interpreters.    FDOC  has  consistently  failed  to \nprovide ASL interpreters for Mr. Martinez. The discrimination began when Mr. Martinez was \nfirst processed at Central Florida Reception Center.  FDOC failed to provide interpreters for the \ncomprehensive interactive process. The processing procedure is designed to provide both verbal \nand written information that will be very important during incarceration. Processing includes \nphysical, psychological, educational, and substance abuse exams and screenings.  Mr. Martinez \nwas also required to attend interactive classes explaining the rules and procedures of the FDOC’s \nprisons. Due to FDOC’s failure to provide effective communication, Mr. Martinez was excluded \nfrom this process because he was deaf.   \n149.  In 2015, Mr. Martinez requested an interpreter at Tomoka C.I. for a GED class \nwhich consisted of lecture and computer based work. In lieu of providing a qualified interpreter, \nMr. Martinez was told he would have to use an inmate assistant, who had hearing loss and was \nnot proficient in ASL and relied mostly on fingerspelling.6  The assistant was unable to keep \npace with the teacher and was not effective.  When Mr. Martinez would respond in ASL, the \ninmate assistant could not properly vocalize what Mr. Martinez was saying. Frustrated, Mr. \nMartinez quit school after one day.  He did not file a grievance regarding the GED issue since he \nsimply decided to quit.  \n150.  Mr. Martinez experienced similar frustration when attempting to communicate \n                         \n6 Fingerspelling is the act of spelling out words with the hands using a manual alphabet, not by using designated \nsigns. Although fingerspelling is used in ASL, it is used for words that do not have established signs, and is not ef-\nfective when used without any established signs. \n- 39 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 40 of 123\nwith the Chaplain.  Mr. Martinez is Catholic and tries to talk with Chaplain Perry Davis.  When \nhe requested an interpreter directly from the Chaplain, he was told that he must use an inmate to \ninterpret.  Again, the inmate assistant only knew how to fingerspell and did not know any signs \nin sign language.  Therefore, Mr. Martinez was not able to communicate with the Chaplain in \nany  meaningful  and  equitable  way.  Additionally,  the  insertion  of  another  inmate  into  his \nreligious conversation hindered his abilities to be as forthright as was needed, for fear the inmate \nassistant would divulge his private information to other inmates.  \n151.  At Tomoka C.I., individuals representing various religions would come to the \nfacility to worship with the incarcerated people.  When Mr. Martinez wanted to participate in \nthose religious events, no qualified interpreter was provided.  Instead, occasionally another \nprisoner attempted to “interpret,” but again it was ineffective because the prisoner was not \nqualified.   \n152.  In August, 2013, FDOC failed to accommodate Mr. Martinez at a very critical \nevent: the mandatory sexual abuse orientation that is required by the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct (PREA) and its regulations.  See 42 U.S.C. § 15601, et seq.  PREA requires the FDOC to \nprovide the orientation during the intake process, and to provide “comprehensive education” on \nsexual abuse topics within 30 days of intake, or within one year from the adoption of the PREA \nstandards for current inmates.  28 C.F.R. § 115.33.  PREA also requires the FDOC to take \n“appropriate steps to ensure that inmates with disabilities (including, for example, inmates who \nare  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing,  those  who  are  blind  or  have  low  vision,  or  those  who  have \nintellectual, psychiatric, or speech disabilities), have an equal opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from all aspects of the agency's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and \nsexual harassment. Such steps shall include, when necessary to ensure effective communication \n- 40 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 41 of 123\nwith inmates who are deaf or hard of hearing, providing access to interpreters who can interpret \neffectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary \nspecialized vocabulary.”  28 C.F.R. § 115.16(a).   Moreover, PREA prohibits the FDOC from \n“rely[ing] on inmate interpreters, inmate readers, or other types of inmate assistants except in \nlimited circumstances.”  28 C.F.R. § 115.16(c).    The FDOC has failed to comply with these \nstandards.    \n153.  During Mr. Martinez’s August 2013 encounter, a video was shown about rape \nprevention, which was followed by a group discussion led by two FDOC staff members.  Despite \nthe fact that there are numerous deaf prisoners at Tomoka C.I., no interpreter was provided \nduring the viewing of the video, nor was the video captioned. Mr. Martinez and the other deaf \nprisoners were forced to stay in the room to watch the inaccessible video, and forced to remain \nduring the group discussion without an interpreter.  Mr. Martinez was then forced to sign a paper \nverifying that he watched and understood the video and group discussion. On August 29, 2013, \nMr. Martinez submitted a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Request.  He received a \nresponse on October 3, 2013, stating that the video would be shown to him again with the close \ncaptioning function utilized.   \n154.  Approximately two weeks after the response, the FDOC provided an interpreter \nfor Mr. Martinez and the other deaf inmates to watch the video.  But this session was led by one \nFDOC employee who provided no narrative about the video and offered no group discussion as \nwas done at the first presentation. Even though Tomoka has a high number of deaf inmates that \nuse ASL, it was only after Mr. Martinez filed the RMAR that an interpreter was provided for this \nimportant training.  Had he not done so, numerous deaf prisoners would not have had access to \nthis critical information.   \n- 41 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 42 of 123\n155.  Even after Mr. Martinez had been designated as deaf by the FDOC, and had been \nhoused at Tomoka for some time, on August 29, 2013, Mr. Martinez filed an informal grievance \nbecause he was asked to speak to the classification department about his progress review, but \nwas not provided an interpreter.  Mr. Martinez did not understand what the classification officer \nsaid, nor was he able to effectively express himself.  It was as a result of this grievance that \nFDOC  finally  provided  the  accommodation  needed.    They  told  Mr.  Martinez  that  the \nclassification progress review would be rescheduled and conducted later with an interpreter.  It \nwas only after this long delay, and requiring Mr. Martinez to file a grievance, was an interpreter \nprovided.   \n156.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Martinez’s request for \ninterpreters. \n157.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. Mr. Martinez has been \nforced to use the antiquated TTY device to place telephone calls.  Because TTY calls take four to \nfive times longer than voice calls due to the time needed for transmission and interpretation, it \ncreates inequitable phone access and causes a higher phone charge for deaf prisoners’ families.  \nUnlike  the  telephones  used  by  the  non-deaf  prisoners,  the  TTYs  are  locked  up  and  only \naccessible when a prisoner signs them out. This results in deaf prisoners being denied access to \nthe phone and/or having less telephone access because their call time is limited.  The TTYs \nprovided at Tomoka C.I. and Columbia C.I. often break down, preventing deaf inmates from \nmaking phone calls.  The calls are often garbled, making the words impossible to read on the \nTTY screen, which leads to the call being terminated prematurely. \n158.  Pursuant to FDOC rules, when a deaf prisoner completes a TTY call, he or she \nmust tear off the printout of the call, write their name and DC number on it, and turn it in to the \n- 42 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 43 of 123\nofficers.  The printout contains the full transcript of the TTY conversation.  Mr. Martinez often \nsees his TTY printouts lying in plain sight for other prisoners to read.     \n159.  Mr. Martinez requested the accommodation of a videophone, which when used in \nconjunction  with  the  free  Video  Relay  Service  (VRS),  allows  faster  and  more  effective \ncommunication for deaf and hard of hearing people who use ASL.  FDOC refused this request, \nand continues to force deaf prisoners to use a TTY which is not only cost prohibitive for the \ninmates, but often breaks down, and often does not effectively provide telephone access. \n160.  Failure  to  Alert  Prisoners  with  Hearing  Disabilities.  Mr.  Martinez  has  been \nexcluded from other prison services and programs entirely due to his inability to hear the staff.  \nFor instance, on September 12, 2013, Mr. Martinez filed an inmate request/informal grievance \nstating that security staff did not alert deaf inmates for meal time, count time, canteen, yard call \nand many other events.  These types of call outs are often made by a guard who is located in a \nsecure officers’ booth.  To make the call outs, the guard will lift a small door flap in the booth \nand shout out various announcements.  Mr. Martinez cannot hear the call outs, and cannot see the \nguards’ mouths to be able to lip-read, even if he had the ability to lip-read effectively.  If Mr. \nMartinez (or other deaf prisoners) do not hear the call out, they risk missing important events \n(such  as  medical  appointments,  visitation,  or  legal  calls).    Mr.  Martinez  has  endured  this \nineffective call out process at Tomoka, Okaloosa C.I., and Central Florida Reception Center.   \n161.  Officers frequently threaten Mr. Martinez with disciplinary reports for failing to \nfollow commands, even though he cannot hear them. FDOC employees ridicule him, calling him \na “faker,” and question his deafness. \n162.  Mr. Martinez requested the reasonable accommodation of using flashing lights \nand signage to properly notify deaf inmates. The grievance was denied. Mr. Martinez was told, \n- 43 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 44 of 123\nincorrectly, that the FDOC uses signage to alert deaf inmate.   \n163.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Martinez’s request for \nalerts. \n164.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services. In the Spring of 2013, while at \nTomoka C.I., Mr. Martinez’s hearing aids were stolen. He reported them stolen, but to date they \nhave still not been replaced. \n165.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs.  In September 2012, Mr. Martinez requested \nto work in the kitchen at Columbia Annex, but was told that deaf inmates are not allowed to \nwork in the kitchen.   \n166.  In December 2012, Mr. Martinez expressed a desire to go to work camp and \ninquired about the status of such placement.  On December 27, 2012, Mr. Martinez received a \nresponse from the FDOC that stated, “You are not eligible for work camp at Tomoka as you are \nhearing  impaired.”  In August  2013,  Mr. Martinez  requested  again to  have  equal  access  to \nprograms and services such as work camp.  This request was “approved” but it did not address \nthe work camp issue.  It simply stated that the progress review discussing the issue would be \nconducted with an interpreter.   \n167.  In September 2013, Mr. Martinez filed an informal grievance based upon the \nPRIDE Enterprise program’s refusal to hire deaf inmates.  This grievance was denied and Mr. \nMartinez  was  told  that,  “Mrs.  Russell  from  Pride  was  interviewed  and  stated  due  to  your \nimpairment and risk involved in this type of industry there is no way to guarantee your safety in \nthis environment.”  Attempting again to participate in work camp, Mr. Martinez submitted a \ngrievance on January 10, 2014, stating that he is deaf and would like to go to work camp.  His \ngrievance was returned “because asking questions are not grievances.”  \n- 44 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 45 of 123\n168.  Engaging  in  Retaliation  or  Interference.    Upon  information  and  belief,  after \nPlaintiff began investigating the violations within Florida’s prisons, the FDOC began to hold \nmeetings with Mr. Martinez to discuss his disability issues.  However, ASL interpreters are not \nprovided.  In lieu of proving qualified interpreters, at CFRC the FDOC forced Mr. Martinez to sit \nin the front of the room and make him attempt to lip-read multiple speakers at the same time.  \nThis is not effective.  At one meeting Mr. Martinez tried to use his “voice” to discuss a concern \nand was told to “shut up.”  At the end of the meeting, prisoners are forced to sign a form \nconfirming there are no pending ADA issues.  Signing the form is not optional. \nLamar Maddox \n169.  Lamar Maddox was incarcerated in the FDOC system at all relevant times.  He is \ndeaf and cannot communicate verbally in spoken English, which substantially limits one or more \nmajor life activity, including but not limited to hearing and speaking.  His primary method of \ncommunication is American Sign Language (ASL).    \n170.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Mr. Maddox is not completely \ndeaf in his right ear.  Sixteen years ago, Mr. Maddox was using a hearing aid while at the \nVolusia County Jail.  However, that hearing aid broke and Mr. Maddox has not been provided \nwith a new hearing aid since.  Mr. Maddox requested a new hearing aid for his right ear in 2000.  \nFollowing his request, Mr. Maddox was transported from Central Florida Reception Center to \nLake Butler to be tested by an audiologist.  Mr. Maddox was then told he would have to wait for \na hearing aid.  Three years later, in 2003, Mr. Maddox was finally fitted for a hearing aid at Lake \nButler.  But Mr. Maddox never received the hearing aid he was tested and fitted for.  Mr. \nMaddox asked medical staff again for a hearing aid in 2005, 2008, 2010, and, most recently, in \n- 45 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 46 of 123\n2013.  Mr. Maddox has never received a hearing aid and was told after each request that he \nwould have to wait.   \n171.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Maddox’s request for \nhearing aids. \n172.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  In addition to being denied a hearing \naid, Mr. Maddox has not once been provided with a qualified ASL interpreter for medical, \ndental, psychological, or classification appointments for the approximately 15 years he has been \nincarcerated at Tomoka C.I.  Medical staff will sometimes attempt to communicate with Mr. \nMaddox by writing English, but Mr. Maddox cannot understand some of the things they write \nbecause English is not his first language.  Mr. Maddox rates his English literacy at a 7th or 8th-\ngrade level.     \n173.  Consequently, because Mr. Maddox cannot communicate with medical staff, in \n2012 he was prescribed the wrong medicine.  Mr. Maddox went to a medical appointment with \nsymptoms of a stomach ache and, due to the communication barrier, was given the wrong \nmedication for his ailment, which he took for six days before the error was discovered.   \n174.  Mr.  Maddox  attends  church  every  week  at  Tomoka  C.I.    A  volunteer  gives \nsermons in ASL once per month; however, on other Sundays there is no sermon in ASL, and a \nqualified ASL interpreter has never been provided for him at church.  Mr. Maddox still attends \non the other Sundays but he cannot understand or fully participate in the services. \n175.  Mr.  Maddox  attended  the  Horizon  Program  at  Tomoka  C.I.    Although  he \ncompleted the program and received a certificate, a qualified ASL interpreter was never provided \nto him during the course and, consequently, Mr. Maddox was not able to understand much of \nwhat was being said during the program. \n- 46 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 47 of 123\n176.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Maddox’s request for \ninterpreters. \n177.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. On May 14, 2012, Mr. \nMaddox reported that officers are leaving printouts of TTY phone conversations on the counter, \nwhere  other  inmates  have  access  to  personal  conversations  and  phone  numbers  to  family \nmembers.  Mr.  Maddox’s  sister  informed  him  that  another  inmate  called  her  without  her \nauthorization.  On June 5, 2012, FDOC returned Mr. Maddox’s grievance because he “did not \nname a specific staff member.”   \n178.  Mr. Maddox also reported that the officers in K dorm do not like to let him use \nthe TTY phone, and he has been denied the use of it 4 or 5 times.  \n179.  Exclusion  from  Jobs  and  Programs.    In  2014,  Mr.  Maddox  asked  his \nclassification officer for approval to work at PRIDE enterprises or in a work release program, but \nhe was turned down for both.  Upon information and belief, he was denied because he was deaf.  \nMr.  Maddox  previously  applied  to  work  at PRIDE  in  2013  and was  turned  down.    Upon \ninformation and belief, it was also because he was deaf. \n180.  Mr. Maddox would like to take programs on reentry skills, such as budgeting, \nfinancial skills, and marriage skills.  However, Mr. Maddox was never permitted to take such \nclasses because he is deaf.   \nCalvin Rodriguez \n181.  Calvin Rodriguez is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \ntimes.  Although he can speak, he is deaf, which substantially limits several major life activities, \nincluding but not limited to hearing.  Mr. Rodriguez has been deaf since he was six months old.  \nHis parents are deaf and all his siblings are deaf.  He effectively communicates through ASL, a \n- 47 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 48 of 123\nlanguage which he has used his whole life.   Mr. Rodriguez has some minor residual hearing that \ncan assist him to some degree if afforded with properly fitted and operable hearing aids.  Mr. \nRodriguez has been designated as a deaf impaired inmate by the FDOC.  His deafness is well \ndocumented in his medical and administrative records, and therefore the FDOC has had full \nknowledge that Mr. Rodriguez is deaf and uses ASL to communicate.  Moreover, he wears a \nbadge every day that says he is DEAF.  \n182.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  In approximately September 2015, Mr. \nRodriguez was accused of talking back to an officer and received a Disciplinary Report (DR).  \nMr. Rodriguez denied the allegations and requested a DR hearing and a certified ASL interpreter \nfor the hearing.  This DR hearing was critical to Mr. Rodriguez, because if found guilty it would \nprevent him from being transferred to a facility closer to his deaf family.  \n183.  When Mr. Rodriguez arrived at the DR hearing in the morning, there was no \ninterpreter and Mr. Rodriguez protested.  He was told to return that afternoon for a hearing with \nan interpreter.  He was in disciplinary confinement during this time.  When he returned in the \nafternoon, in lieu of securing a qualified and neutral interpreter, FDOC called an employee, Mr. \nCarter, who worked in the Educational Department to act as the interpreter.  On information and \nbelief, Mr. Carter is not a trained ASL interpreter, he holds no credentials as an interpreter, and \nhis signing was reportedly incomprehensible.  Mr. Carter does not meet the definition of a \nqualified interpreter under the ADA regulations. \n184.  Once  Mr.  Carter  began  to  sign,  it  was  apparent  he  was  not  qualified.  Mr. \nRodriguez was unable to understand Mr. Carter, and Mr. Carter was unable to interpret the \ndialogue that occurred at the DR hearing.  Mr. Rodriguez was not provided meaningful access to \nthe hearing and was unable to present his side of the story.  He was found guilty of the infraction, \n- 48 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 49 of 123\nand his request for a transfer, which had been in the works for over two years, was denied.  Mr. \nRodriguez was extremely upset and frustrated.  He appealed the decision, but it was denied.  \n185.  On November 17, 2015, Mr. Rodriguez was sent to confinement because it was \nalleged that he was intoxicated in some way.  He requested an interpreter for his DR hearing.  As \nhe waited for his DR hearing, on November 26, 2015, Mr. Rodriguez attempted to commit \nsuicide by cutting himself.  He was moved to an observation cell in confinement, where his \nglasses and hearing aids were taken away.  His hearing aids help abate the symptoms of his \ntinnitus, which causes unbearable ringing in his ears.  Without his glasses he could not see, and \nwithout his hearing aids he suffered from severe ringing in his ears.   \n186.  Prisoners in observation are required to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  Mr. \nRodriguez requested an interpreter for his evaluation, but was told that no interpreter would be \nprovided.  As a result, Mr. Rodriguez refused to meet with the doctor and began a hunger strike.  \nThree days later, he was asked to again submit to the evaluation, but he refused unless an \ninterpreter was provided.  The FDOC still refused to provide one.   \n187.  Medical staff continued to insist that Mr. Rodriguez meet with the doctor without \nan interpreter.  Mr. Rodriguez finally relented and met with the doctor without an interpreter, but \nwas unable to effectively communicate during the psychological evaluation.  Throughout his \nconfinement, Mr. Rodriguez continued to ask for the return of this glasses and hearing aids, but \nthey were not returned until much later when his family called on his behalf.     \n188.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Rodriguez’s request for \ninterpreters. \n189.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  Like every other deaf \nprisoner, Mr. Rodriguez is forced to use the antiquated TTY to contact his family. Non-deaf \n- 49 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 50 of 123\ninmates at the prison can freely use the telephone when needed; however, deaf inmates must sign \nout the TTY, and their telephone time is limited.  Because Mr. Martinez’s parents and siblings \nare deaf, placing calls through the TTY does not provide meaningful and equitable access to \ntelecommunications.  Mr. Rodriguez’s deaf family, like the majority of the deaf community, uses \nvideophones to communicate by telephone and stopped using TTYs over nine years ago.  \n190.  To place a call to his deaf sister, Mr. Rodriguez must do the following:  1) He \ncalls the Florida Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS); 2) once an operator answers he must \ntype his conversation on the TTY; 3) the TRS operator then reads the TTY screen and vocalizes \nthe call to a Video Relay Service Interpreter; and 4) the video interpreter interprets the vocalized \nmessage into sign language so that his sister can receive the message on her Videophone.  When \nMr. Martinez’s sister responds during the telephone call she 1) signs her comments in ASL; 2) \nthen the VRS interpreter vocalizes her comment to the TRS operator who then 3) types the \nmessage to Mr. Rodriguez; 4) who then must read his TTY screen.  This process is not only time \nconsuming, but it increases the cost of the telephone call astronomically. If the FDOC simply \nprovided a videophone, Mr. Rodriguez could communicate directly with his sister, just like the \nnon-deaf inmates speak directly to their family members without intermediaries.  \n191.  Mr. Rodriguez has been forced to endure this ineffective process because he \nwants to stay in touch with his deaf family, however in March 2015 his telephone calls to his \nfamily were blocked.  For some unknown reason, when Mr. Rodriguez now tries to call his deaf \nfamily through the TRS and the VRS his calls are blocked and he is told he cannot place these \ncalls because the Columbia Annex is “restricted.”  Once denied the ability to call his family, Mr. \nRodriguez sought the help of his deaf sister Vivian Rodriguez.  Ms. Rodriguez emailed the \nFDOC and asked for assistance for her brother.  FDOC provided a convoluted answer which in \n- 50 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 51 of 123\nessence said they would not provide a videophone to allow Mr. Rodriguez to make equitable \ntelephone calls, and that TTY calls would not work through the Video Relay Service.  Without a \nvideophone at the prison, the Video Relay Service is needed so that Mr. Rodriguez can contact \nhis family. \n192.  In the summer of 2015, a representative from Securus went to see Mr. Rodriguez \nat Columbia Annex to explain why he could not place calls through TRS and VRS. However, the \nFDOC failed to provide a qualified interpreter for the meeting and instead called a prisoner, who \nonly knew fingerspelling, to attempt to interpret.  Mr. Rodriguez left the meeting having no \nunderstanding of what the technical representative said about the blocking of his calls. \n193.  Mr. Rodriguez is still unable to call his deaf family.  He is also now currently \nhoused  in  T-dorm,  which  does  not  have  a  TTY,  and  as  a  result,  Mr.  Rodriguez  has  no \ntelecommunications access at all.   \n194.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  FDOC fails to provide \nvisual  or  vibrating  alert  devices  to  allow  Mr.  Rodriguez  to  safely  and  timely  respond  to \ncommands in the prison.  Mr. Rodriguez has missed breakfast approximately 60% of the time \nbecause he cannot hear the breakfast call.  As a result, Mr. Rodriguez submitted a Reasonable \nModification or Accommodation Request for a wrist watch that vibrates instead of providing an \nauditory alarm. That request was denied. \n195.  Mr. Rodriguez then asked for an aid who knew some sign language and would be \nreliable in waking him up and alerting him to other activities in the prison.  That request was also \ndenied.  \n196.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Rodriguez’s request for \neffective alerting accommodations. \n- 51 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 52 of 123\n197.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Due to the fact that FDOC fails \nto provide him qualified interpreters Mr. Rodriguez requested an alternate and inferior device: \nthe Ubi Duo.  This device allows two people who can read and write proficiently to type back \nand forth in a more natural manner than lip-reading.  The device is comprised of two portable \nkeypads and screens that are synched to each other.  Mr. Rodriguez’s request for the Ubi Duo in \n2014 was also denied.   \n198.  Prior to his incarceration Mr. Rodriguez regularly wore two hearing aids so that \nhe could hear some sounds, which increases his safety.  FDOC tested his hearing in 2013 and \ntold him he would benefit from two hearing aids, but the second hearing aid has still not been \nprovided, pursuant to FDOC policy.  Due to FDOC’s failure to provide two hearing aids, in 2015 \nMr. Rodriguez’s family offered to pay for two hearing aids for his use.  The FDOC declined the \noffer. \n199.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Rodriguez’s request for \nhearing aids and other devices. \n200.  Engaging in Retaliation or Interference.  Due to their lack of training, officers \nthreaten Mr. Rodriguez with Disciplinary Reports for failing to follow commands. Employees of \nFDOC ridicule and belittle him by standing behind him and “testing” his hearing by speaking \nbehind his back to see if he can hear.  This humiliating and degrading behavior fosters an \nenvironment in which deaf inmates feel unsafe and excluded. \nSamuel Hart \n201.  Samuel Hart is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe is hearing impaired, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including but \nnot limited to hearing.  He can speak.  His does not know ASL.  Mr. Hart also requires the use of \n- 52 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 53 of 123\na hearing aid.  Mr. Hart has been designated as a deaf impaired inmate by the FDOC.  His \nhearing loss is well documented in his medical and administrative records; therefore the FDOC \nhas  had  full  knowledge  that  Mr.  Hart  cannot  hear  and  would  therefore  require  some \naccommodations.  Moreover, every day he wears an FDOC badge that says he is DEAF.  \n202.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters. Mr. Hart communicates by using his \nresidual hearing and lip-reading.7  Although this helps him to get through many one-on-one \nconversations,  it  is  not  effective  in  a  group  setting  such  as  a  classroom.    Throughout  his \nincarceration, he has submitted various grievances which reflect his need for an Oral Interpreter8  \nto  provide  effective  communication  when  he  attends  church,  meetings,  classification \nappointments, disciplinary reviews and other events.  All of his requests were denied.  \n203.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Hart’s  request  for \ninterpreters. \n204.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  FDOC has repeated failed \nto ensure that Mr. Hart’s assigned assistants are carrying out their responsibilities effectively.  \nFor example, in July 2012, Mr. Hart’s assigned assistant was not waking him up for count or \notherwise alerting him that staff is calling him.  Mr. Hart addressed this with both the medical \nand classification departments but the matter did not get resolved. Mr. Hart stated that FDOC \nsimply reassigns the assistants, the cycle continues and the issues do not get resolved.  FDOC \nresponded to Mr. Hart’s concerns on July 30, 2012, stating that inmates do not choose their own \n                         \n7 Lip reading is also known as speech reading. It has been reported that only approximately 30% of what is said in \nEnglish can be accurately read on the lips. \n  \n8  An Oral Transliterator, also known as an Oral Interpreter, does not use sign language.  Instead, they use silent oral \ntechniques and natural gestures to transliterate a spoken message from a person who hears to a person who is deaf or \nhard-of-hearing. Oral Interpreters are trained to understand and repeat the message and intent of the speech and \nmouth  movements  of  the  person  who  is  deaf  or  hard-of-hearing.  See http://www.rid.org/rid-certification-\noverview/otc-certification/ (last visited January 18, 2016).  Mr. Hart mistakenly requested a cued speech interpreter \nthinking it was the term for Oral Interpreter.  \n- 53 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 54 of 123\nassistants and that if there is a medical issue that is not being addressed, he should notify the \nmedical department.   \n205.  The problem with his assistant persisted and in August 2012, Mr. Hart filed \nseveral formal grievances.  In these grievances, Mr. Hart reported that he was given a choice to \neither accept his assistant as is or to sign a refusal.  If Mr. Hart were to sign a refusal then he was \ntold that he would be stating that he does not need any assistance.  Mr. Hart pointed out that, \naccording to FDOC policy, his assistant must be trained to assist him.  Mr. Hart claimed that his \nassigned assistant does not know how to interpret and he does not know any cued speech.  FDOC \ndenied his request and referred Mr. Hart back to the July 30, 2012, FDOC response wherein he \nwas advised that inmates do not choose their own assistants and that if there is a medical concern \nhe should notify the medical department.    \n206.  In April 2013, Mr. Hart was placed in confinement at RMC. Meals are served in \nconfinement by having an inmate walk down the confinement area hall with a food cart.  There \nare no visual alerts or other notifications to tell the inmates in confinement when the meal cart is \ncoming. If an inmate is not standing erect at the door of their confinement cell when the meal \ncart arrives, they will miss their meal.  Due to the FDOC’s failure to provide visual or vibrating \nalerts, Mr. Hart missed several meals.  He was so frustrated that he taped two cards in his cell \nwindow with the words, “Impaired Deaf inmate” in large black letters on one card and “Hearing \nimpaired” written in large red letters on the other.  He hoped this obvious signage would prevent \nhim from missing meals, but they did not work.  He grieved this issue, but his grievances were \nreturned  for  failing  to  follow  proper  procedures  in  submitting  the  grievances.    Mr.  Hart \nresubmitted the grievances attempting to comply with the procedural requirements and they were \nagain returned.  In May 2013, when he filed a grievance claiming that his concerns were not \n- 54 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 55 of 123\nresponded to, FDOC then denied his grievances stating that they had been submitted in duplicate.  \nMeanwhile, Mr. Hart, because he could not hear the call-outs, continued to miss a number of \nmeals and went days and even an entire week at one point without a shower.   \n207.  In March 2014, at Tomoka Correctional Institution, Mr. Hart was moved from the \nJ-2 Dorm to the E-Dorm. Mr. Hart reported that the J-2 Dorm is specifically for hearing impaired \ninmates and now that Mr. Hart has been moved, he is going to need an impaired inmate assistant \nmore than ever.  FDOC responded on April 1, 2014, stating “I don’t know why you were moved- \nI’ll check into it. You don’t have a pass for an aide.”  \n208.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Hart’s request for alerts. \n209.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs.  On June 7, 2013, Mr. Hart requested to be \ntransferred to another institution so that he could participate in a vocational sign language course \nthat was held there and could improve his communication skills.  He stated that he is deaf and \nwill eventually be “totally deaf” and would benefit from such a program.  On June 19, 2013, \nFDOC denied this request and the ADA coordinator concurred with the decision to deny the \nrequest to transfer to another institution. \n210.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. On May 20, 2013, Mr. \nHart submitted a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Request at Tomoka Correctional \nInstitution, complaining that the TTY could not access the confidential toll-free TIPS hotline to \nreport general crimes and rape.  Non-deaf inmates can freely call the TIPS line through the \nregular phone, and benefit from the safety the TIPS line provides.  On June 3, 2013, this request \nwas denied and Mr. Hart was informed that these issues were out of the control of the institution.    \n211.  Mr. Hart filed a formal grievance and was informed on June 26, 2013, that, \n“Securus is required to connect a TTY user to a Relay Center Operator who then facilitates \n- 55 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 56 of 123\ncollect only calls.  By policy they will not connect a user to a toll-free number and they won’t \nleave voice mail messages.  Since the crime tip line is a voice mail only function there would be \nno way to facilitate these types of calls.” Mr. Hart then appealed the matter to the FDOC \nSecretary  on  July  1,  2013.  The  inquiry  was  forwarded  to  FDOC’s  Bureau  of  Contract \nManagement (BCM).  In November, FDOC responded, “[a]ccording to the contract provider, \nSecurus Technologies, it will take an estimated (60) Sixty days for the work to be completed and \nthe  issue  resolved.  But  they  are  working  diligently  to  resolve  it.  Based  on  the  foregoing \ninformation, your appeal is denied.”   \n212.  The  TIPS  line  is  still  not  accessible  via  the  TTY.    For  instance,  Mr.  Hart \nattempted to place a call to the TIPS line via the TTY in approximately October 2015 and \nJanuary 2016, but the calls do not get routed through the relay service; they go directly to the \nautomated TIPS answering service, which, of course, the deaf and hard of hearing prisoners \ncannot hear.   \n213.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  FDOC has also failed to provide \nother auxiliary aids that would enable Mr. Hart to have equal access to programs and services.  \nFor example, on May 20, 2013, Mr. Hart submitted an accommodation request for batteries for \nhis headphones and volume booster in order to be able to utilize the television transmitter.9   This \nrequest was denied and Mr. Hart was informed that batteries are not provided and must be \npurchased from the canteen.  Mr. Hart appealed and on June 19, 2013, and his request was \ndenied again.  An appeal to the FDOC Secretary on June 21, 2013, was also denied.   \n214.  This operated as an illegal surcharge on Mr. Hart.   \n215.  On  May  20,  2013,  Mr.  Hart  reported  that  he  cannot  hear  well  enough  to \n                         \n9 At some prisons, FDOC maintains a policy that the volume is not used on the television sets. Therefore, when \nprisoners watch television they must listen to the TV audio through a separate individual radio with headphones. \n  \n- 56 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 57 of 123\nunderstand church services and other programs and submitted an accommodation request for a \npocket talker10 with dual loops11 and cup type headphones.  The FDOC responded that since Mr. \nHart has hearing aids, a pocket talker is not allowed.   The FDOC said the cup type headphones \nwere approved but must be purchased through the Independent Living Aids, a vendor of the \nFDOC.   This again operated as an illegal surcharge.   \n216.  Mr. Hart appealed this response and pointed out two issues.  First, a pocket talker \nwould work well with hearing aids.  Second, Mr. Hart had been without hearing aids for months \nat that point.  His appeal was denied. Mr. Hart then appealed to the FDOC Secretary and this \nappeal was also denied on August 9, 2013 and Mr. Hart was reminded that, “You were advised \npreviously that the pocket talker you requested was not an approved auxiliary aid. You should be \nable to hear effectively with your hearing aids.”   \n217.  The FDOC has failed to provide and maintain hearing aids for Mr. Hart.  On April \n1, 2013, Mr. Hart filed a grievance stating that he had been without hearing aids for several \nmonths.  He turned in his hearing aids in January 2013 and he was told that both hearing aids \nwould either be repaired or replaced within 30 days.  On April 15, 2013, FDOC denied this \ngrievance and informed Mr. Hart that he has been approved for new hearing aids since the ones \nturned in were not repairable.  Mr. Hart was further informed that he would receive a call out for \nclinic in order to be fitted for his new hearing aids.    \n218.  Mr. Hart was fitted for the new hearing aids, but had not yet received them.  Mr. \nHart filed a request for administrative remedy on August 7, 2013 regarding receipt of his hearing \n                         \n10 Pocket talkers are a type of assistive listening device that consists of personal amplifiers used to increase volume \nin face-to-face and small group conversations.  They are about the size of a deck of cards with both a microphone \nand listening cord connected to them.  See https://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/systems-and-devices \n(Last visited January 15, 2016).    \n \n11 Dual Loops, as requested by Mr. Hart, can be worn around the neck, and can work in conjunction with the tele-\ncoils in hearing aids or can be plugged into pocket talkers and headphones.  The telecoil allows a hearing aid to \nmore effectively pick up sounds from electronic devices.      \n- 57 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 58 of 123\naids.  On August 21, 2013, FDOC denied his grievance stating that, \"You have already gone to \nyour appointment to receive your hearing aids.  Your care has been equal to or above community \nstandards.”  Still without his hearing aids, Mr. Hart appealed this denial to the FDOC Secretary. \nThis was again denied, informing Mr. Hart that he was scheduled for an appointment “in the very \nnear future.”  In November or December of 2013, Mr. Hart finally received his hearing aids.     \n219.  In approximately February 2014, Mr. Hart’s new hearing aids were stolen from \nhis lock box along with his headphones and his booster.  He reported the theft, but his hearing \naids were not replaced.  On September 8, 2014, Mr. Hart requested an update on getting new \nhearing aids.  He received no response.  Mr. Hart filed an informal grievance on September 24, \n2014, again asking for an update on his hearing aids.  His grievance was denied and he was told \nat that point that an appointment would not be made until he signed a withdrawal for $360.00 so \nthat his hearing aids could be re-made.  This again operated as an illegal surcharge.   He \neventually received his hearing aids in approximately October 2015, although they are not \nproperly functioning.  \n220.  The FDOC has failed to ensure equal access to television programming.  For \nexample, in 2015, Mr. Hart was transferred to Union Correctional Institution, a facility which \ninitially did not have closed captioning on the television sets. Mr. Hart grieved the lack of \ncaptioning.  Captioning  is  now  provided;  however,  the  FDOC  fails  to  ensure  that  the \naccommodation is maintained.  Often the other prisoners will turn off the captions, leaving Mr. \nHart unable to access television viewing.  It is not safe for Mr. Hart to protest turning off the \ncaptions with the other prisoners, and the FDOC fails to intervene. \n221.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Hart’s request for hearing \naids and other devices. \n- 58 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 59 of 123\nRobert Hawk \n222.  Robert Hawk is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe is deaf, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not limited to \nhearing.  His primary method of communication is ASL.    \n223.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  On July 23, 2012, Mr. Hawk received \na disciplinary report for alleged possession of a contraband cell phone.  The statement of facts on \nthe report alleged that Mr. Hawk admitted in written notes to the sergeant that the phone \nbelonged to him.  However, in his July 27, 2012, witness statement, Mr. Hawk wrote that he \nnever admitted to anything and that “[t]hey were misunderstood my writing to colonel…I didn’t \nsay I admitted to anything.”  Mr. Hawk was placed in confinement and his visitation privileges \nwere suspended.  \n224.  Mr. Hawk filed a grievance related to the July 23, 2012 incident stating that he \ndid not admit to owning the contraband phone.  He asked the disciplinary team to obtain a copy \nof the notes taken by the officer questioning him, but he was refused.  He stressed that those \nnotes were valid evidence.  He also reported that the disciplinary team failed to provide an ASL \ninterpreter upon his request.  This grievance was denied on August 31, 2012, stating, “You were \nfound guilty based on the statement of facts and the witness statements.”   \n225.  At  a  disciplinary  hearing  the  following  year,  the  FDOC  again  failed  to \naccommodate Mr. Hawk by not providing an interpreter.  On June 4, 2013, Mr. Hawk filed a \ngrievance claiming that at a disciplinary hearing for contraband, no ASL no interpreter was \nprovided.  He stated in his grievance that, “Sgt. notified about my need for sign language \ninterpreter. Violated my ADA right.  I was handcuffed in the back, unable to writing [sic] my \nverbal statements, the hearing quickly plea me guilty without judgement.”  The grievance was \n- 59 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 60 of 123\ndenied and did not address the interpreter issue.  Mr. Hawk’s visitation privileges were again \nsuspended after being found guilty of the infraction. \n226.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Hawk’s  request  for \ninterpreters. \nRoosevelt King \n227.  Roosevelt King is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has severe hearing loss, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including \nbut not limited to hearing.  Mr. King requires the use of hearing aids. \n228.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  On May 7, 2013, Mr. \nKing filed a grievance reporting the following: Mr. King was residing in I dorm at Reception \nMedical Center but there was no TTY there.  He had a pass to goto the J dorm to use it but was \ngiven  a  disciplinary  report  for  being  in  an  unauthorized  area.  King  requested  to  have  the \ndisciplinary infraction removed.  On May 17, 2013, Mr. King received a denial and was told that \nstaff have discretion to accept or reject Mr. King’s reasons for being where he was and staff \nfound his reasons insufficient.  Mr. King appealed this to the FDOC Secretary May 31, 2013 and \nit was again denied.  \n229.  In February 2014, at Jefferson Correctional Institution, Mr. King requested to be \nmoved to H dorm so that he could use the TTY.  Mr. King stated, “Please move me so I can call \nmy family.  I haven’t been able to use the TTY in over a month.”  On February 23, 2014, his \nrequest was denied and he was told to “follow up with medical; you do not meet the criteria for \nTTY phone use.”  Mr. King made the request to the medical department as instructed and was \nagain told that he did not meet the criteria for TTY phone use.  \n230.  Confused by FDOC’s responses in light of the fact that he had been previously \n- 60 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 61 of 123\napproved for and had been using the TTY for years, Mr. King filed a formal grievance.   Mr. \nKing was told by the ADA coordinator that he does not meet the criteria to use the TTY even \nthough he has been using a TTY since 2009.  King noted that the FDOC just spent $2500 on a \nhearing aid that helps very little.  Mr. King reported that “all I hear is just sound (beeps) over a \nregular phone” which is why he has a pass to use the TTY.  However, he is not housed where the \nTTY is located and would like to be moved.  On May 16, 2014, his grievance was denied.  On \nMay 28, 2014, Mr. King appealed the denial of his formal grievance to the FDOC Secretary and, \non July 2, 2014, it was again denied.   To date, at Jefferson Correctional Institution, Mr. King \nstill must be escorted to another dorm to use the TTY, greatly limiting the amount and time of \nday he is permitted to use it.  In contrast, prisoners using the typical voice phone have much \ngreater access to it.   \nKenneth Land \n231.  Kenneth Land is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has severe hearing loss, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including \nbut not limited to hearing.  Mr. Land requires the use of hearing aids.  FDOC has been aware of \nMr. Land’s disability since the beginning of his incarceration in 1981.  \n232.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access.  On June 27, 2012, an \nImpaired Inmate Management and Service Worksheet (IIMS) recommended that Mr. Land have \naccess to a TTY and noted that he did not have access to it at that time.  On August 3, 2012, Mr. \nLand submitted an inmate request asking that a TTY be installed.  FDOC told Mr. Land that it \nwas “being worked on.”  However, a December IIMS documented that there was still no TTY \navailable in Mr. Land’s complex and he had been waiting more than six months.  Mr. Land was \ntransferred to another institution before this was resolved.      \n- 61 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 62 of 123\n233.  In August 2014, Mr. Land was moved to DeSoto Correctional Institution for a \ngood adjustment transfer.  There was no TTY there either.  He filed a formal grievance about this \non November 12, 2014.   Mr. Land was then moved out of DeSoto and sent to Dade Correctional \nInstitution.  He was transferred within several weeks to Northwest Florida Reception Center’s \nMain Unit where, again, he did not have access to a TTY.  After complaining to FDOC, Mr. \nLand was finally moved to Northwest Florida Reception Center’s Annex where there is a TTY.   \n234.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  Mr. Land is continuously at \nrisk for being charged with disciplinary infractions because he cannot hear guards’ commands \nand call-outs.  For example, in May 2014, security staff actually called the medical department to \ndetermine  whether  or  not  Mr.  Land  had  an  assigned  impaired  inmate  assistant  because  it \nappeared to security that Mr. Land was having hearing difficulties resulting in disciplinary \ninfractions.  This continues to be a problem for Mr. Land at his current institution, Northwest \nFlorida Reception Center.   \n235.  Moreover, due to the absence of alerting devices, Mr. Land’s cellmate must wake \nhim in the morning because Mr. Land is not able to hear the guards’ commands.  Instead of \nproviding an accommodation, the guards kick the cell door on some occasions and he can feel \nthe vibrations which may wake him, but this is not always the case and he has missed wake up \ncalls.  Mr. Land filed an informal grievance on August 5, 2014, stating that he could not hear \nwhat the officers were saying over the intercom, and that he needed an inmate assistant because \nhe was losing his vision.  The response said, “[i]f you feel that you an impaired inmate that \nrequires special needs and assistance, you need to send an Inmate Request to Mr. Edwards, \nAssistant Warden of Programs, and he will set up an evaluation.”  The response ignored the fact \nthat Mr. Land had been designated an impaired inmate for years.  On August 6, 2014, Mr. Land \n- 62 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 63 of 123\nreceived a Corrective Consultation, which is a disciplinary action that does not result in a formal \nDisciplinary Report (DR), for not sitting up in his bed during count.  As Mr. Land pointed out, he \nwas not sitting up because he could not hear the announcement that it was count time.    \n236.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Land’s request for alerts. \nRichard Tasker \n237.  Richard Tasker is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nMr. Tasker is deaf, he has tinnitus, and although he can speak, he has difficulty communicating.  \nMr. Tasker became deaf later in life—at approximately age 40—and as a result he struggles to \nacquire skills to allow him to communicate effectively.  Mr. Tasker has some minor residual \nhearing and if given properly fitted and operable hearing aids, can hear to some degree.  Mr. \nTasker was in a motorcycle accident in 1973 that crushed his vertebrae, resulting in chronic \ncervical, thoracic and lumbar pain which impedes his mobility.  Mr. Tasker’s left leg was \namputated in 2000 while in FDOC custody.  He uses a leg prosthesis and a wheelchair for \nlimited mobility, and requires special shoes.  His deafness and mobility issues substantially limit \nseveral major life activities, including but not limited to hearing, walking, and caring for himself. \n238.  Mr.  Tasker  has  been  designated  as  a  mobility  impaired  inmate  and  a  deaf \nimpaired inmate by the FDOC.  His deafness and other disabilities are well documented in his \nmedical and administrative records by FDOC.  FDOC has full knowledge that Mr. Tasker has \ndisabilities and requires accommodations.  Moreover, every day he wears a badge in the prison \nwhich says he is DEAF, and he sits in a wheelchair when it is made available to him. \n239.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters. Because Mr. Tasker does not use ASL, \nand can speak, often the FDOC wrongly believes he can communicate in a bi-directional way.  \nSince July 2013, Mr. Tasker has filed at least ten grievances or Reasonable Modification or \n- 63 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 64 of 123\nAccommodations Requests seeking the services of an Oral Interpreter.  Oral Interpreters were \nrequested  for  disciplinary  review  hearings,  programing,  medical  visits,  classification \nappointments, dental visits, mental health visits, and other investigations.  To date, FDOC has \nfailed to provide an Oral Interpreter for any of his interactions with FDOC.  \n240.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Tasker’s  request  for \ninterpreters. \n241.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. Mr. Tasker has been \nallowed to use the TTY while incarcerated by the FDOC since approximately 1997.  Even with \nthe documented need and historical authorization to use the TTY, since June 2008 Mr. Tasker \nhas had to file approximately eleven grievances or other requests to use the TTY equitably.  \n242.  Mr. Tasker’s TTY related grievances include the FDOC denying him use of the \nTTY because the FDOC said he was no longer deaf enough, limiting his call time to fifteen \nminutes,  and  placing  the  TTY  in  a  physical  location  which  was  inaccessible  to  him  as  a \nwheelchair user.  Although Mr. Tasker has used the TTY in the FDOC system for approximately \n16 years, when transferred to different facilities, the FDOC fails to provide him with access to a \nTTY, and he must renew his request for use.  To gain equitable telephone access, Mr. Tasker was \nforced to grieve the absence of effective telecommunications access multiple times.  \n243.  Moreover, the FDOC has a practice of requiring deaf inmates like Mr. Tasker to \ngo  the  medical  department  to  get  authorization  to  use  the  TTY,  and  therefore  pay  a  $5 \ncopayment.  This copayment operates as an illegal surcharge to obtain an accommodation or \nauxiliary aid.   \n244.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Mr. Tasker’s records outline the \ndiscrimination he experienced trying to get the FDOC to accommodate his hearing loss through \n- 64 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 65 of 123\nany means possible. The FDOC’s own records verify the policymakers’ misunderstanding of the \nefficacy of hearing aids.  \n245.  The FDOC makes the following notes in Mr. Tasker’s records: “Your hearing aid \nprovides you the ability to hear the TV.” (5/31/14); “You are assigned a hearing aid which has \ncorrected your hearing.” (8/4/14); “You have the ability to hear when you wear your hearing aid \nthat has been documented by medical.” (11/13/14); “According to our clinic here you have no \nproblems communicating and hear fine with hearing aids.” (12/5/14); “You have a hearing aid \nand all phones at Franklin C.I. have adjustable volume, this is ample accommodation to allow \nyou to use the phone.” (4/8/15). Contrary to what the FDOC documents in Mr. Tasker’s records, \na hearing aid does not make a deaf person have perfect hearing. When properly fitted, hearing \naids can help to amplify and clarify some sounds.  But hearing aids do not guarantee that Mr. \nTasker can hear all spoken dialogue, commands, noises, TV audio, voices on a telephone, or \nother alerts.12  \n246.  When a prisoner is given a hearing aid by the FDOC, it is not tested for all \napplications in which it may be needed.  For instance, its efficacy is not tested while the prisoner \nis using the phone, watching TV, listening to a PA system, and in other situations where the \nhearing aid must be used. Inmates are simply given the hearing aid to use with the hope that it \nwill help for all of the inmates’ needs.  For example, FDOC performed Mr. Tasker’s hearing \nevaluation in a special audiological booth at Reception and Medical Center, but he was not \nallowed to test it in other situations.   \n247.  As a result of FDOC’s fundamental misunderstanding of the efficacy of a hearing \naid, Mr. Tasker has been on a 16-year journey to be accommodated properly for his hearing loss. \n                         \n12 See “Hearing aids can't restore normal hearing.” http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/in-\ndepth/hearing-aids/art-20044116 (last visited January 19, 2016). \n- 65 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 66 of 123\nFor example, the radio available for purchase in the canteen does not allow him to hear the TV \naudio. As a result, Mr. Tasker requested a reasonable auxiliary aid of a radio with amplification \naccessories to watch TV.  Even though his family agreed to purchase the device for him, the \nFDOC denied his request to be accommodated. \n248.  FDOC records show that Mr. Tasker has been requesting the accommodation of a \nradio  with  the  accompanying  booster  and  amplifier  so  that  he  can  participate  in  equitable \ntelevision viewing since approximately March 2005. Although FDOC’s medical department \ndiagnosed him as having hearing loss, they continually deny his request for a radio saying, in \nessence, that he is not deaf enough. As recent as November 2014, he was once again denied the \naccommodation of an amplified radio. \n249.  Upon  repeated  written  requests,  FDOC  denied  Mr.  Tasker  any  alternate \naccommodation to the radio, except telling him to use his hearing aids.  FDOC repeatedly fails to \ngive primary consideration to his request for an amplified radio.  In fact, they have failed to \nprovide him any effective accommodation in lieu of the standard radio.  As of December 2015, \nMr.  Tasker  has  not  been  provided  a  radio  with  sufficient  amplification  and  clarification \ntechnology that allows him access to the TV audio. \n250.  The FDOC has also failed to grant his 2013, 2014 and 2015 requests for a \ntransmission device to attach to the TV so that amplified radios can be used by deaf and hard of \nhearing inmates.   \n251.  Unable to hear the TV through a radio, Mr. Tasker has tried but has been unable \nto access the TV audio through seeing the spoken word via captioning.  On September 21, 2013, \nMay  14,  2014  and  February  13,  2015,  Mr.  Tasker  made  Reasonable  Modification  or \nAccommodation Requests or grieved the need for captioning.  All were denied.  \n- 66 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 67 of 123\n252.  In response to his February 13, 2015 grievance, Mr. Tasker was told report to the \nmedical department if he had further issues.  But again, the $5.00 copayments operate as an \nillegal surcharge. \n253.  When Mr. Tasker has been afforded closed captioning at certain facilities, the \nnon-deaf inmates will often turn off the captions, complaining they block sections of the TV \nscreen. It is unsafe for Mr. Tasker to protest the caption removal, and the FDOC fails to \nintervene to safeguard his federally protected rights. \n254.  As the FDOC continually denied his requests for radios, TTYs, captioning and \nother accommodations, in July 2013, Mr. Tasker attempted to obtain the accommodation of a \npocket talker. A pocket talker is a device equipped with a microphone that amplifies sound \nresonating near the inmate (for example, a guard’s voice), and then to some degree clarifies that \nsound.  A  pocket  talker  could  possibly  assist  Mr.  Tasker  with  hearing  noises,  commands, \ndialogue or other alerts as he travels through the prison buildings.  This request was denied by \nthe FDOC, again by telling him his hearing aids were a sufficient accommodation. \n255.  The FDOC has also failed to provide Mr. Tasker with functioning hearing aids.  \nMr. Tasker’s medical and administrative records document the tension between Mr. Tasker and \nthe FDOC about the granting, use, fitting, and need for batteries for his hearing aids.  He has \nfought to get the correct number of properly fitted hearing aids and batteries as far back as May \n2012.  \n256.  Hearing aids provide Mr. Tasker a level of safety.  Hearing aids allow him to hear \nthe voices of some officers and inmates when they are in close proximity and looking at him, \nmaking it easier and safer for him and others to navigate through prison life. They also provide \nhim the ability to protect himself to some degree because although he may not be able to identify \n- 67 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 68 of 123\na loud sound, he will hear something.  FDOC has littered Mr. Tasker’s records with denials for \nother accommodations based on him having operable and properly fitted hearing aids, when in \nfact that he has not always had the correct number of operable and properly fitted hearing aids.   \n257.  The  FDOC  failed  to  give  primary  consideration  to  Mr.  Tasker’s  request  for \nhearing aids and other devices. \n258.  Failure  to  Alert  Prisoners  with  Hearing  Disabilities.  The  FDOC  fails  to \naccommodate Mr. Tasker with any type of device to assist him with hearing, and fails to \nstructurally modify the prisons with visual flashers or other signage.  As a result, Mr. Tasker has \nmissed call-outs, count, yard calls, and other commands which lead to reprimands, disciplinary \nreports, or missing meals, appointments, and access to the recreation yard.   \n259.  As early as October 9, 2013, Mr. Tasker submitted an inmate request seeking help \nwith following officer commands, stating, “[t]here is no way that I can hear [officers] calling me \nover intercom (yard) unless I’m looking dead at them when I’m being called spoken to” and \n“[y]ou have to do something because I’m getting in trouble for not hearing the orders and trying \nthings they’re saying to me.  They act as though I can hear them and I can’t 100% only about \n50% and this is only when my hearing aids are functioning.  Please I don’t want to get into any \ntrouble, please.”  However, FDOC failed to provide Mr. Tasker with any accommodations for \nthis issue.   \n260.  In a July 2014 grievance appeal filed by Mr. Tasker, he again tells the FDOC he \ncan’t hear the commands of the officers.  FDOC failed to act.  Then in October 2014, there was a \nverbal announcement for inmates to remove kitchen items from their cells.  Mr. Tasker did not \nhear the command and received a Disciplinary Report for not following orders.  At the DR \nhearing, Mr. Tasker requested an Oral Interpreter to help him understand what was happening. \n- 68 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 69 of 123\nThe request was denied, and he was found guilty of having the kitchen items in his cell in \ndefiance of a verbal order.  \n261.  In June 2015, Mr. Tasker grieved a corrective consultation for again failing to \nfollow a verbal order.  On this occasion Mr. Tasker was in the bathroom when a verbal command \nwas made for inmates to report to count. Mr. Tasker did not hear the order. \n262.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Tasker’s request for alerts. \n263.  Engaging in Retaliation and Interference.  Upon information and belief, after \nPlaintiff began investigating the violations within the FDOC, Mr. Tasker has been asked to \nattend  two  ADA  Review  meetings  to  discuss  his  ADA  concerns  during  his  30  years  of \nincarceration.  Both meetings occurred at Franklin C.I.  On one occasion, Mr. Tasker was called \nto an ADA Review meeting, but because he was denied a pusher for his wheelchair, he arrived at \nthe meeting late, and was told he could not participate because he was late.  At another ADA \nmeeting, Mr. Tasker tried to discuss issues he was having as a deaf inmate, and the assistant \nwarden for security looked directly at him and told him to “shut the fuck up.”  \nKevin Osborn \n264.  Kevin Osborn was incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe was formally committed to prison by the State of Wyoming, but spent 13 years in the FDOC \nsystem under an interstate compact agreement.  He has hearing loss, which substantially limits \none or more major life activity.  He began losing his hearing significantly at age 55 while in \nprison and as a result can speak very well, but he does not know ASL.  Mr. Osborn also requires \nthe use of a hearing aid.  Mr. Osborn has been designated as a deaf impaired inmate by the \nFDOC.  His hearing loss is well documented in his medical and administrative records; therefore \nthe FDOC has had full knowledge that Mr. Osborn cannot hear and would therefore require some \n- 69 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 70 of 123\naccommodations.  Moreover, every day he wears an FDOC badge that says he is Impaired. \n265.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  Mr. Osborn communicates by using \nhis residual hearing and lip-reading.  Although this helps him get through some one-on-one \nconversations, it is not effective in all settings such as telephonic hearings.  Since 2014, Mr. \nOsborn submitted various grievances which reflect his need for an Oral Interpreter to provide \neffective communication.  Although interpreters were approved for his use, he only received an \ninterpreter one time during his incarceration.  \n266.  Mr. Osborn was scheduled to have a telephonic parole hearing with the Wyoming \nDepartment  of  Corrections  on  March  10,  2015.    Because  the  Okaloosa  C.I.  administration \nbuilding had no operable TTY, Mr. Osborn was unable to participate by phone, and requested an \noral interpreter for the hearing.  Because the FDOC failed to act in time, the hearing had to be \npostponed to March 12, 2015 to allow time to secure either an operable TTY and or an oral \ninterpreter.  The FDOC failed to provide either, and the hearing was postponed a second time to \nMarch 24, 2015.  \n267.  But even with the significant advance notice, the FDOC failed again to provide \neither accommodation for the March 24, 2015 hearing.  As a result, Ms. Ellis Armstrong, a \nclassification specialist, insisted that she act as Mr. Osborn’s interpreter.  In lieu of providing an \noperable TTY or a qualified and trained oral interpreter which would have allowed Mr. Osborn \nto independently participate in his parole hearing, Ms. Ellis would listen to the parole board on \nthe telephone, and then “tell” Mr.  Osborn what was being said.  This was not effective, and \ndenied him the two-way exchange required in a parole hearing. Mr. Osborn strenuously objected \nto using Ms. Armstrong as an “accommodation” and expressed his objection to the members of \nthe Wyoming Parole Board.  Ms. Armstrong then terminated Mr. Osborn’s parole hearing \n- 70 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 71 of 123\n268.  Mr.  Osborn  then  filed  a  formal  grievance  about  the  denial  of  effective \ncommunication  for  the  telephonic  parole  hearing  and  requested  another  parole  hearing.  \nAlthough Mr. Osborn never agreed to allow Ms. Ellis to act as an interpreter, on April 6, 2015, \nthe FDOC responded to his grievance by saying Mr. Osborn agreed to the classification officer \nhelping with the telephonic hearing, based on the fact that in essence both the FDOC and Mr. \nOsborn knew the TTY did not work. This was not true because Mr. Osborn was told the TTY \nissues would be corrected, but they never were.  Mr. Osborne was also told in the response that \nanother parole hearing would be scheduled.  \n269.  However, Mr. Osborne did not receive a new date for his parole hearing, so he \nthen sent a letter to the Wyoming Parole Board on April 28, 2015 asking about the rescheduling \nof his parole hearing.  On May 4, 2015, the Wyoming Parole Board told Mr. Osborn by way of \nletter that his hearing was not rescheduled and that the result of the March 24, 2015 parole \nhearing, which he was unable to access due FDOC’s failure to accommodate him, was that his \nparole had been denied. This caused a great deal of stress and concern for Mr. Osborne who had \nbeen denied parole without the opportunity to be heard at his hearing. \n270.  Upset about the discrimination and the inability to participate in his own parole \nhearing, Mr. Osborne sent another letter to the Wyoming Board of Parole on June 4, 2015 stating \nthe FDOC told him he would get a new parole hearing due to the lack of the interpreter and \ninoperable TTY during the March 24, 2015 hearing.  On June 12, 2015, the Wyoming Board of \nParole finally agreed to provide a new parole hearing.  On June 23, 2015, over three months after \nthe date Mr. Osborn should have had his parole hearing, and after enduring a great deal of \nunnecessary stress, Mr. Osborn was granted a hearing with a qualified interpreter.  \n271.  These problems have persisted in the medical context.  In October 2012, Mr. \n- 71 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 72 of 123\nOsborn was diagnosed with an aortic abdominal aneurism.  Thus, when he attended medical calls \nhe wanted to make sure there was no miscommunication.  As his hearing became worse, in \nFebruary 2014 Mr. Osborn requested an Oral Interpreter for his medical consultations. His \nrequest was approved but only as “medical deem necessary.”  Even with this approval, the \nFDOC failed to provide interpreters for any of his medical visits. \n272.  As a result of substandard medical care he was receiving, in January 2015 Mr. \nOsborn filed a medical negligence lawsuit against Corizon (the private medical provider) and a \nCorizon doctor. A telephonic hearing was scheduled on the matter on July 10, 2015.  Mr. \nOsborne filed a motion with the Court requesting a telephone appearance explaining to the Court \nthat he will be using a TTY to attend the hearing.  On July 6, 2015, the Court granted Mr. \nOsborn’s motion and advised of the immediate need to contact the court so that his call can be \nplaced through the CourtCall system. This instruction was included not only in the Court’s Order \nbut in a letter signed by the Court on the same day. \n273.  Again Mr. Osborn requested the use of an operable TTY or a qualified oral \ninterpreter from the FDOC for the July 10, 2015 hearing.  On July 10, 2015, Classification \nOfficer Brunson attempted to call the Court so that Mr. Osborne could participate in the hearing \nby way of TTY.  But the FDOC was unable to provide an operable TTY line for this hearing, \nwhich was the exact same problem Mr. Osborn experienced in March 2015 for his telephonic \nparole hearing. FDOC tried unsuccessfully to get the antiquated device to connect with the \nCourt, but failed. The hearing did not happen because no contact with the court could be made.   \n274.  On July 21, 2015, Mr. Osborn filed a Request for an Administrative Remedy \nbased on his inability to participate in the telephonic hearing, explaining that this was the same \nproblem he faced months before and should have been rectified. His request was denied, and the \n- 72 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 73 of 123\nFDOC placed the blame for the failed TTY call on the Court’s CourtCall system and not on the \ninoperable TTY line.  Eventually, the court rescheduled the hearing for August 12, 2015. \n275.  Unfortunately,  the  August  12,  2015  telephonic  court  hearing  was  just  as \ninaccessible as the July hearing. Again, in lieu of providing a qualified interpreter or an operable \nTTY, Classification Officer Johnson falsely and over Mr. Osborn’s objections told the Court she \nwas his “oral interpreter.”  Without an interpreter or an operable TTY, Mr. Osborn had to rely on \nMs. Johnson who attempted to type everything the Court and defense counsel said during the \nhearing so that Mr. Osborn could read the dialogue on a computer screen.  Although Mr. Osborn \nwas able to speak at times, he could not effectively participate in the hearing because of Ms. \nJohnson’s  inability  to  type  quickly  and  without  error.   As  a  result, Mr. Osborn could not \nunderstand all of what the court and opposing counsel was saying, which left him unable to \nmeaningfully and effectively participate, although he tried.  Moreover, Ms. Johnson could not be \nconsidered “impartial,” as the lawsuit is against FDOC’s medical contractor, and Ms. Johnson is \nan FDOC employee. When Mr. Osborn grieved the use of the classification officer, the FDOC \nagain responded by saying, falsely, that Mr. Osborn agreed to it.  Mr. Osborn vehemently denies \nhe agreed to use the classification officer instead of being provided a qualified interpreter or a \nworking TTY. \n276.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Osborn’s request for \nqualified oral interpreters. \n277.  Failure to Alert Prisoners with Hearing Disabilities.  The FDOC has failed to \nmake the required structural modifications to ensure that prisoners with hearing disabilities can \nhear announcements, wake in the morning, or respond to emergency drills.  As a result, Mr.  \nOsborn must rely on a cellmate to wake him in the morning or he will miss meal calls. He must \n- 73 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 74 of 123\nalso rely on other inmates during emergency evacuation drills due to the absence of proper \nlighting or vibrating devices to warn him independently of emergencies. In the event of an \nevacuation, Mr. Osborn must be able to independently evacuate, and not rely on others inmates \nwho may put his safety second to theirs. \n278.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. As discussed above, Mr. \nOsborn has been denied access to a TTY for telephonic hearings. Additionally, in October 2013, \nMr. Osborn filed a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Request because the TTY relay \nnumber had not been added to his calling list.  In order for a deaf person to place a call on the \nTTY, they must go through the Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS).  Without the TRS the \ncall cannot be made, unless the call is being made directly to another TTY user.  The vast \nmajority of all TTY calls from prison must go through the TRS.  Mr. Osborn was denied \nequitable phone access because he could not call TRS.  In December 2013, the TRS number had \nstill not been added to his call list.  It wasn’t until January 2014, after the holidays, that the TRS \nnumber was added allowing him to make telephone calls more equitably. \n279.  In  November  2014  while  at  Okaloosa,  Mr.  Osborn  filed  a  formal  grievance \nbecause the TTY was only working for 15 minutes, and not the longer time allotted for TTY \ncalls.  On December 5, 2014, FDOC responded to the grievance by stating they inspected the \nTTY and it was working fine.  This response demonstrated that staff fail to understand how the \ndevice operates.  A person trained on the use of a TTY would know that it was not the TTY \ndevice itself that was shutting off after 15 minutes, but it was Securus, the telephone provider, \nthat was automatically terminating the calls after 15 minutes. On December 16, 2014, Mr. \nOsborne promptly appealed the decision and explained to the FDOC how the TTY works and \nidentified Securus as the issue.  FDOC did not respond until April or May of 2015, saying that it \n- 74 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 75 of 123\nwould run a separate cable to ensure that the TTY would not terminate calls after 15 minutes.    \n280.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  FDOC has also failed to provide \nauxiliary aids that would enable Mr. Osborn to have equal access to programs and services.  \nWhen certain aids and services are approved, the FDOC imposes an illegal surcharge.  For \nexample, in January 2015 Mr. Osborn requested headphones so that he can hear the radio and \nutilize the television transmitter.  This request was approved, but Mr. Osborn was told he would \nneed to pay for these accommodations himself.  This operated as an illegal surcharge on Mr. \nOsborn.    \n281.  The FDOC has failed to ensure equal access to television programming.  At \nOkaloosa  C.I.,  the  FDOC  fails  to  ensure  that  the  closed  captioning  accommodation  is \nmaintained.  Often the non-deaf inmates will turn off the captions and will not allow them to be \nturned on. It is not safe for Mr. Osborn to protest turning off the captions with the other inmates, \nand the FDOC fails to intervene. \n282.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Osborn’s request for \nauxiliary aids and services. \nBobby Webb \n283.  Bobby Webb is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe is severely hearing impaired, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, \nincluding but not limited to hearing.  Mr. Webb has been incarcerated since 1980 and began to \nexperience hearing loss in 2002.  He had previously served for 10 years in the Navy and worked \naround jet engines, sometimes without hearing protectors. \n284.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  On March 10, 2014, Mr. Webb \nsaw an audiologist at Northwest Florida Reception Center (NWFRC), who told Mr. Webb that he \n- 75 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 76 of 123\nhad  no  hearing  in  his  right  ear  and  less  than  40%  hearing  in  his  left.    The  audiologist \nrecommended a hearing aid for his left ear and advised Mr. Webb to begin learning ASL.   \n285.  Later that month, Mr. Webb saw an ear, nose, and throat specialist at NWFRC, \nwho also found he had significant hearing loss and noted that the audiologist had recommended a \nhearing aid.  The ENT specialist also recommended a hearing aid for Mr. Webb’s left ear.   On \nMarch 26, 2014, Dr. Resilard submitted a consultation request for a hearing aid for Mr. Webb, \nnoting that an amplification device was recommended by audiology and by the ENT.  The \nrequest was denied by the FDOC on April 4, 2014. \n286.  In April of 2014, Mr. Webb had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Resilard, \nwhere Mr. Webb was informed that his hearing aid had been denied, despite being recommended \nby the two specialists.   \n287.  As a result of FDOC’s failure to provide Mr. Webb with hearing aids, Mr. Webb \ncannot hear officers paging him on the intercom, sometimes cannot hear officers’ orders, and is \noften unaware of what is going on in prison.  Mr. Webb has lost any semblance of independence \nhe previously had, as he is forced to rely on other prisoners to make sure he is in compliance \nwith officers and conduct his day-to-day living activities. \n288.  Mr.  Webb  continues  to  be  denied  hearing  aids  despite  his  profound  and \ndocumented hearing loss.  Mr. Webb also suffers from dizziness, which may be the result of his \ndiminished hearing and lack of hearing aids.     \n289.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Webb’s request for hearing \naids and other hearing assistive devices. \nFernando Sotolong \n290.  Fernando Sotolong is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \n- 76 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 77 of 123\ntimes.  He is hearing impaired, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, \nincluding but not limited to hearing.  Mr. Sotolong requires the use of a hearing aid in his right \near. \n291.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. In September 2014, the \nperson Mr. Sotolong had been calling with the TTY received a phone bill for $360.35 for \nfourteen TTY calls.  Because of this exorbitant bill, Mr. Sotolong has not used the TTY since \nthen as he is afraid of such charges.  Mr.  Sotolong attempted to use the regular phone to call his \nmother who is very ill by pushing it very close to his ear, but he still could not hear.  Each time \nhe files a grievance, FDOC claims that it is beyond their control. \nValerie Boyette  \n292.  Valerie Boyette was incarcerated in the FDOC system from February 25, 2015 to \nDecember 23, 2015.  She is deaf, cannot communicate well with spoken English, cannot lip-read \neffectively and cannot read proficiently, all of which substantially limits several major life \nactivities,  including  but  not  limited  to  hearing  and  speaking.    Her  primary  method  of \ncommunication is American Sign Language (ASL).  Ms. Boyette was diagnosed as being deaf \nwhen she was five months old.  She was designated as a deaf impaired inmate by the FDOC and \nis only 23 years old.   She had a badge which says she is Hearing Impaired. \n293.  Failure to Provide Qualified Interpreters.  FDOC consistently failed to provide \nASL interpreters for Ms. Boyette.  The discrimination began when she was first processed at \nFlorida  Woman’s  Reception  Center  (FWRC).  FDOC  failed  to  provide  interpreters  for  the \ninteractive  receiving  process.  Processing  includes  physical,  psychological,  educational,  and \nsubstance  abuse  exams  and  screenings.  Due  to  FDOC’s  failure  to  provide  effective \ncommunication, Ms. Boyette was excluded from this process because she was deaf.   \n- 77 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 78 of 123\n294.  In lieu of providing qualified interpreters, Ms. Boyette was told she would have to \nuse inmate assistants as her interpreters.  Many of the assistants could not sign adequately, and \nall  of  them  afforded  her  no  privacy  or  confidentiality.    Ms.  Boyette  had  several  medical \nappointments where no qualified interpreter was provided; instead she was forced to attend the \nappointment  with  another  inmate.    Sometimes  Ms.  Boyette  was  given  an  impaired  inmate \nassistant who knew sign language, but then that assistant would be transferred and Ms. Boyette \nwould again be without the ability to communicate. Ms. Boyette filed Inmate Requests at FWRC \nand at Lowell C.I. to obtain interpreters. But she only received a qualified interpreter one time \nduring her incarceration, which was the day she graduated Boot Camp on December 23, 2015.  \n295.  During her incarceration, Ms. Boyette attended one AA meeting, and at that \nmeeting  she  was  forced  to  use  an  inmate  interpreter  who  only  knew  how  to  fingerspell.  \nAlthough Ms. Boyette was still unable to follow much of what was said because there was no \ninterpreter, the inmate who would finger spell was better than nothing, and allowed her gather \nsome of what was happening.  Moreover, for Ms. Boyette to attend future meetings, both Ms. \nBoyette’s name and the name of the inmate interpreter needed to be on the attendee list. The \nFDOC never put the inmate interpreter’s name on the list.  Ms. Boyette filed an Inmate Request \nasking for the inmate interpreter to be allowed to attend, regardless of the inmate interpreter's \nskill, but FDOC refused. She was denied the ability to benefit from the AA meetings and never \nattended another AA meeting. \n296.  Upon her arrival at the FWRC she was also mocked and belittled by the guards.  \nThey called her “deaf and dumb,” teased her, told her she was feigning her deafness and \nmimicked her signing in an offensive way.  She filed several Inmate Requests seeking help for \nthe bullying and intimidation but received no response to her requests.  The bullying continued at \n- 78 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 79 of 123\nLowell C.I.   \n297.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Ms. Boyette’s request for \ninterpreters.  \n298.  Failure to Provide Effective Telecommunications Access. Immediately upon her \narrival to FWRC, Ms. Boyette requested to talk with her family by telephone.  Because she was \ntold FDOC does not provide videophones, she asked to use the antiquated TTY. Ms. Boyette \nthen began a 10 month quest to try to place a call to her family through a TTY.  But it never \nworked.  Throughout Ms. Boyette’s 10-month incarceration, she never was never once able to \ncommunicate with her family through the TTY. \n299.  Accessing the TTY was a multi layered problem created by the FDOC, and Ms. \nBoyette received conflicting responses as to why she could never call her family.  First, she was \nplaced in dorms that did not have a TTY, and when that occurred she had to make requests to be \ntransferred to a dorm with a TTY. This happened several times at both FWRC and Lowell. \n300.  Ms. Boyette’s mother began a calling and emailing campaign to receive a TTY \ncall from her daughter.  Ms. Boyette’s mother spoke to classification officers, assistant wardens \nand Securus representatives and was provided conflicting responses several times each month.  \nIn March and in May of 2015, Ms. Boyette’s mother was told the phone list had not been \napproved.  In June 2015, Securus said the mother’s account was working properly, but the FDOC \nsaid the list had not been approved.  In July, Ms. Boyette’s mother was told by Classification \nthey had not received the list but would contact her, and the assistant warden said she would \ncheck on it.  In August, the classification department told her they were still trying to get the \nTTY to work and they would assign Ms. Boyette a new pin number.   \n301.  Once Ms. Boyette was transferred to the Boot Camp on approximately August 20, \n- 79 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 80 of 123\n2015, she was told to bring the TTY with her because allegedly the TTY issues had been \nresolved.  However, when Ms. Boyette attempted to call her mother the TTY call would not go \nthrough.  FDOC thought the TTY was broken and obtained a new TTY. The new TTY was set \nup in approximately September 2015 and Ms. Boyette attempted again to call her mother. The \nTTY call would still not go through.  \n302.  FDOC  was  never  able  to  correct  the  TTY  issue.  In  lieu  of  providing  her  a \nvideophone, the FDOC had an officer at the Boot Camp make a phone call for Ms. Boyette each \nSaturday to her family. To place the call, the officer would talk to her family, and then write \ndown what the family was saying to Ms. Boyette   Then Ms. Boyette would write what she \nwanted to say to her family and the officer would vocalize her words into the telephone. This \nprocess did not constitute equitable and effective communications access.  \n303.  Failure  to  Alert  Prisoners  with  Hearing  Disabilities.  Ms.  Boyette  has  been \nexcluded from other prison services and programs entirely due to her inability to hear the staff.  \nFor instance, other prisoners had to wake her up in the morning.  When other prisoners forgot to \nwake her, the guards would kick her bed which scared her and made her feel unsafe.  Ms. \nBoyette endured this intimidating wake up procedure at FWRC and Lowell.   \n304.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs.  Ms. Boyette did not receive the mandatory \nsexual abuse orientation that is required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).  Instead the \nFDOC provided her some sheets of paper with rules on them, but she did not fully understand the \npapers. \n305.  Ms. Boyette was Court-ordered to attend Boot Camp, and at first the FDOC \nrefused to allow her to attend, telling her that the FDOC does not allow deaf prisoners at the \nBoot Camp.  She became very upset and through the use of an inmate interpreter had to explain \n- 80 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 81 of 123\nwhy it was unfair to deny her the opportunity to try Boot Camp because of her deafness. Only \nupon her protests did the FDOC let Ms. Boyette attend Boot Camp, where she was able to \nsuccessfully complete the program. She was told she was the first deaf woman to be allowed in \nBoot Camp. \nPrisoners with Mobility Impairments \nDennis Waller \n306.  Dennis Waller is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nMr. Waller had back surgery in 2011 and has not been able to walk since then.  He has a physical \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not limited to \nwalking.  He uses a wheelchair for mobility.     \n307.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities.  On November 14, 2013, \nMr. Waller filed an informal grievance complaining that there are 15 wheelchairs in one dorm \nand not enough space to access all programs and services, such as watching television.  The \ngrievance was denied.   \n308.  Mr. Waller has had difficulty using the shower facilities because there was only \none handicapped shower at Mayo C.I., where he was housed.  There was also not sufficient room \nin the dining hall for all the inmates using wheelchairs, and the outdoor track is not paved, thus \nmaking it impossible to use it with a wheelchair and exercise.   \n309.  In  January  2014,  Mr.  Waller  filed  a  formal  grievance  at  Mayo  Annex, \ncomplaining that there were 12 wheelchairs in J2 Dorm and only one accessible shower, which \ndid not have a handheld wand, thus making it inaccessible.   \n310.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants.  Mr. Waller has had \ndifficulty getting his wheelchair repaired and/or replaced.  On May 21, 2015, Mr. Waller asked \n- 81 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 82 of 123\nfor his wheelchair to be fixed as it developed a problem with its wheels and bearings.  Mr. \nWaller was told to “watch for callout.”  On July 24, 2015, he inquired again and was told the \nwheelchair was on backorder.  On August 26, 2015, he asked again and was told it would take up \nto two weeks. FDOC finally issued Mr. Waller a new chair on Friday, September 24, 2015, \nnearly four months after his initial request.  \n311.  After he received his new wheelchair, Mr. Waller has seen the old broken ones \nout on the grounds being used by other inmates.  He is able to verify that they are the same \nwheelchairs because he can identify them either by number or he recognizes the missing parts.   \n312.  On March 15, 2013, Mr. Waller filed an informal grievance complaining that he \nhad never met the inmate who was supposedly assigned to push his wheelchair.  Mr. Waller has \ncontinued to have difficulty securing such assistance throughout his incarceration.  He has gone \nweeks and even months at a time without a “pusher.”  When this happens, Mr. Waller must get \nhimself around the grounds of the prison and it is extremely difficult, often arriving late for \nmeals and other activities or arriving drenched in sweat.  If one pusher is no longer available, the \nprocess of requesting and securing a new one can take months.   \n313.  For example, Mr. Waller had a pusher at Mayo Correctional Institution but that \nindividual was no longer available after being sent to confinement.  On June 9, 2015, another \nprisoner requested to be Mr. Waller’s pusher.  FDOC responded, “You’ll be reviewed.”  Mr. \nWaller inquired about the status on June 15, 2015, and FDOC responded that training would be \nscheduled. Mr. Waller inquired again and was informed, “I’m working on it.”  To date Mr. \nWaller still does not have a wheelchair pusher assigned to him. \n314.  Engaging in Retaliation and Interference.  Mr. Waller and the other prisoners \nwho use wheelchairs have been subjected to unfair harassment that interferes with their equal \n- 82 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 83 of 123\naccess to FDOC programs, services, and activities.  For instance, Officer Mossley has been \ntelling the inmates that no one other than an assigned inmate is allowed to assist a wheelchair-\nuser.  As a result, on October 21, 2015, there was no one available to assist Mr. Waller with \ngetting to a medical appointment because his assigned assistant was in confinement, and Officer \nMossley would not permit another inmate to assist Mr. Waller.  Mr. Waller filed an informal \ngrievance about this on October 23, pointing out that it took three and a half months for his \ncurrent assistant to be assigned, and he would rather not be harassed for several months waiting \nfor a new one.   \nDavid Belle \n315.  David Belle is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  As \na result of a birth defect, Mr. Belle is missing both feet and uses two artificial limbs. He can \nambulate to some degree, but not for long periods of time, and for that reason he also uses a \nwheelchair  for  mobility.  His  right  hand  is  missing  most  of  the  digits.  His  mobility  issues \nsubstantially limit several major life activities, including but not limited to walking and caring \nfor himself.  Mr. Belle has been designated as a mobility impaired inmate by the FDOC.  His \ndisabilities are well documented in his medical and administrative records by FDOC.  FDOC has \nhad full knowledge that Mr. Belle is disabled and requires accommodations.  Moreover, every \nday he wears a badge in the prison which says he is IMPAIRED, and uses prostheses or sits in a \nwheelchair. \n316.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities. Mr. Belle has been housed \nat a number of facilities including Gulf C.I., Mayo C.I. and Suwanee Annex.  Each facility has \nfeatures that are inaccessible to wheelchair users.  At Suwannee C.I., there are ten inmates with \ndisabilities who must share one handicapped accessible urinal, and one handicapped toilet stall. \n- 83 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 84 of 123\nThis is not sufficient to accommodate the disabled inmates who require longer time for toileting.  \nThe one handicapped stall in the bathroom is often taken over by other prisoners without \ndisabilities.  As a result the stall is constantly in use.  It is widely known that abled bodied \ninmates use the handicapped stall, but the FDOC fails to ensure that the toilets are available for \nthe prisoners with mobility impairments. \n317.  The  showering  facilities  at  Gulf  C.I.,  Mayo  C.I.,  and  Suwanee  C.I.  are  not \naccessible to Mr. Belle.  Mr. Belle is unable to bring his wheelchair into the shower, and cannot \nshower with his artificial limbs or they will be damaged.  Mr. Belle must jump out of his \nwheelchair and shower on the stall floor while balancing himself on his knees. This is degrading \nand humiliating for Mr. Belle.  Once Mr. Belle completes his shower he must jump back into \nhis wheelchair while his body is still wet.  This has caused water damage to his wheelchair seat, \nand as a result his wheelchair has been replaced three times.  If Mr. Belle was afforded an \naccessible shower stall, with proper benches, wands, and accessible water control handles, this \npreventable wheelchair damage would not occur. \n318.  The shower benches at the three facilities are insufficient in a number of ways.  \nThe benches are too far from the shower head to be able to use them while showering.  At \nSuwannee C.I. the bench is on a hinge, and Mr. Belle must physically push the bench out of the \nway so that he may shower on the stall floor on his knees.  The hinge does not lock, and if he \nmakes any contact with the bench while showering it will fall and hit him on the head.  Similar \nbench barriers exist at Mayo and Gulf C.I.  Due to his missing digits and feet he can’t balance \nhimself on the bench to reach the water controls.  Therefore, at Gulf C.I., Mayo C.I., and \nSuwanee C.I., the only way Mr. Belle can reach the hot and cold water controls is when he is on \nhis knees on the floor.  The shower wands at the three facilities are either of insufficient length or \n- 84 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 85 of 123\nnot provided at all.  Mr. Belle has requested a shower wand at Suwannee, but it has not been \nprovided. \n319.  At Gulf C.I., Mayo C.I., and Suwanee C.I., Mr. Belle is not afforded any privacy \nwhen using the handicapped shower stall.  The stalls are in plain view of other inmates and the \nguards, and there is no privacy screen.  Mr. Belle tries to position his wheelchair or a laundry \ncart to block the view of others, including female guards, but sometimes the guards tell him to \nmove the obstruction.  The abled bodied inmates are afforded the ability to shower behind a half \nwall which blocks the view of the lower half of their bodies. \n320.  The dining halls at Gulf C.I., Mayo C.I. and Suwanee C.I. have insufficient \nseating for wheelchair users.  Inmates with disabilities must wait, often outside without cover, \nuntil a seat is available for their wheelchair.  Inmates with disabilities wait longer to eat than the \nabled bodied inmates. \n321.  At Gulf C.I., Mayo C.I. and Suwanee C.I., Mr. Belle is excluded from activities \non the yard. The facilities offer only a cement sidewalk to a pavilion, where the handicapped \nseats are limited. The walking track is made of dirt which prohibits inmates in wheelchairs from \nusing it, or if used risk destroying their wheelchairs and tires.  The abled bodied inmates are \nallowed to enjoy basketball, volleyball and other activities, while the inmates in wheelchairs are \nlimited to travel to and from the pavilion.  The pavilion has a checker table, but the FDOC fails \nto provide checkers. \n322.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants.  Although Mr. Belle \nhas two prosthetic legs, he often must use a wheelchair to travel longer distances on the prison \ncompounds, for call-outs, showering, or when going to the dining hall.  The wheelchair is needed \nat the dining hall because he must wait a long time in line to be seated, and due to his disability is \n- 85 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 86 of 123\nunable to stand for a long duration.  \n323.  When Mr. Bell was first incarcerated in 2014, he was sent to the Central Florida \nReception Center in Orlando, Florida.  He arrived with his two prosthetic legs, and upon arrival \nrequested a wheelchair.  FDOC told Mr. Belle he could either use his prosthesis or a wheelchair, \nbut he could not have both.  Mr. Belle explained that he needs a wheelchair in addition to the \nprostheses because he cannot walk long distances, cannot stand for long period of times and \nwhen his body is tired it impacts the efficacy of the prostheses.  The wheelchair request was \ndenied. \n324.  On April, 24, 2014, the same day he arrived, instead of being provided a low bunk \nand low tier cell as he requested, he was placed on a top bunk on the second floor of the facility. \nLater that same day Mr. Belle, fell down the stairs at the facility.  After this preventable injury, \nFDOC finally provided him a wheelchair, a low bunk, and a low tiered cell.  However, when Mr. \nBelle was transferred to Mayo C.I., they would not renew his wheelchair pass. Mr. Belle, with \nhis documented disabilities in the FDOC records, needed to submit another request to obtain a \nwheelchair pass at Mayo C.I.  \n325.  Mr.  Belle  is  now  using  his  third  FDOC  issued  wheelchair  which  has  been \nrepeatedly replaced due to damage while showering.   His current wheelchair is ripped on the \nseat and near the rods which provide support to the seat.  Mr. Belle requested a cushion for the \nseat to cover the tears and for support, but his request was denied. \n326.  Engaging  in  Retaliation  or  Interference.    Mr.  Belle  has  filed  a  number  of \ngrievances in an attempt to improve the conditions of his incarceration, and as a result has been \nthreatened by FDOC staff.  While at Gulf, Warden Blackwood and the Assistant Warden told \nMr. Belle if he did not stop filing grievances they would have someone in the compound “take \n- 86 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 87 of 123\ncare of him.”  The stress of having a disability while incarcerated caused Mr. Belle to lose 55 \npounds since he entered prison a year and a half ago. \n327.  Mr. Belle has been forced to sign “refusal forms,” which in essence state that he \nhas no ADA access issues pending.  Signing these forms was not optional.  In October or \nNovember of 2015, Mr. Belle, along with approximately 90 other wheelchair users were called \nfor an ADA review meeting.  After waiting an hour in line, the majority of the impaired inmates \njust signed the refusal form because FDOC could not manage the crowd, and it is well known \nthat these meetings do not rectify access issues. \nTroy Cheeks \n328.  Troy Cheeks is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe is paraplegic, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not \nlimited to walking and caring for himself.  Mr. Cheeks uses a wheelchair for mobility.     \n329.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities.   Mr. Cheeks has faced \nbarriers throughout his incarceration due to his wheelchair use and FDOC’s failure to comply \nwith the ADA.  Mr. Cheeks was placed in confinement at Dade Correctional Institution on \nOctober  14,  2011  and  the  showers  there  were  not  ADA  complaint.    Accordingly,  he  was \npermitted to shower in the medical department.  However, his first shower did not take place \nuntil the Friday after Thanksgiving, over a month later.  He was permitted to shower in the \nmedical department several more times but was then met with resistance.  On December 19, \n2011, Mr. Cheeks was taken to the medical department to receive treatment and a shower but the \nmedical officer refused to assist him stating that she worked in medical and did not want Mr. \nCheeks taking showers there.  It was not until Mr. Cheeks filed a grievance on January 2, 2012, \nthat the issue was resolved.   \n- 87 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 88 of 123\n330.  Mr.  Cheeks  faced  barriers  at  other  FDOC  institutions  as  well.    In  2014,  he \nreported that his unit at Mayo Correctional Institution was only equipped with one handicapped \naccessible bathroom with grab bars.  Mr. Cheeks has to wait when other prisoners are using the \nshower and has been harassed by the other prisoners when he tells them he needs to use it.  On \nseveral occasions, other prisoners have smeared feces on the toilet in retaliation.   \n331.  Another concern with the accessible bathrooms at Mayo Correctional Institution \nis that there is no privacy wall, forcing the inmates to be exposed to other inmates and guards \nwhen they shower.  This makes Mr. Cheeks extremely uncomfortable.  The institution informed \nMr. Cheeks that they would remedy the problem, but as of September 2015, it had not been \nfixed.  \n332.  There are other areas of Mayo Correctional Institution that are not accessible to \nMr. Cheeks and other inmates who use wheelchairs.  The dining hall, for example, does not have \nenough spaces for wheelchairs and there is not a place that Mr. Cheeks can exercise.  There is no \nexercise equipment he is able to use and the track is made of dirt, making it impossible to \ntraverse in a wheelchair.  In addition, there is no accessible scale in the medical department.  \nSince Mr. Cheeks is unable to stand on the regular scale, he has not been weighed in over a year.   \n333.  Failure  to  Provide  and  Maintain  Wheelchairs  and  Assistants.    Mr.  Cheeks \ninformed the responsible FDOC staff in January 2012 that his wheelchair would soon need new \nwheels.  The staff person informed Mr. Cheeks that she had never ordered such equipment.  Mr. \nCheeks asked her to speak with another staff member familiar with such equipment.  The staff \nperson did so and told Mr. Cheeks in February 2012 that the wheels would be ordered.  In May \n2012, Mr. Cheeks still did not have his new wheels.  He filed a grievance and on May 31, 2012, \nFDOC approved the grievance and finally placed the order.   \n- 88 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 89 of 123\n334.  Mr. Cheeks’s wheelchair is customized for him and was his own chair prior to \nincarceration.  He is not able to use the standard institution issued wheelchairs as he is fully \nparaplegic and fears he will fall out.  In 2014, Mr. Cheeks began asking for a new wheelchair as \nhis is about 10 years old.  Both brakes on Mr. Cheeks chair are broken, creating danger for Mr. \nCheeks particularly when he transfers to and from his wheelchair. His requests for a replacement \nwheelchair suitable for his condition have been denied and to date, Mr. Cheeks does not have a \nnew one. \nThomas Pekari \n335.  Thomas Pekari was incarcerated in the FDOC system at all relevant times.  He \nsuffers from multiple injuries, including spinal fractures, which cause him severe pain and \nprevent him walking anything longer than very short distances.  The injuries substantially limit \none or more of his major life activities, including but not limited to walking.  He requires the use \nof a wheelchair for moving more than very short distances.  He is also a military veteran.  \n336.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants.  In June 2011, he \nsubmitted an informal grievance complaining that his wheelchair had been taken away.  In \nAugust, the response noted that they did not believe he needed a wheelchair or a wheelchair \npusher.  By December 2011, his wheelchair was falling apart.  He filed a grievance asking for a \nreplacement or permission to bring in his own.  The grievance was denied, saying wheelchairs do \nnot fall within the FDOC’s donation policy.   \n337.  In June 2012, he filed a grievance saying that his wheelchair, which had been \napproved by Dr. Colombani, was taken away.  He explained that although security claimed he \ncould walk, he could only walk sometimes and needed the wheelchair.  It was denied, saying \nthere was no indication for a wheelchair at this time.   \n- 89 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 90 of 123\n338.  In January 2014, Mr. Pekari filed a formal grievance seeking a 20 inch wheelchair \nto fit him,  noting that the 18 inch wheelchair is causing more damage to both knees and \naggravating his shoulder injuries.  It was denied in February, but the denial said that a larger \nwheelchair had been ordered. \n339.  During this period, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs was willing to provide \nMr. Pekari with his needed equipment at their expense, but the FDOC would still not allow it.  \nBrian Follmer \n340.  Brian Follmer is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe  has  neuropathy  (pain,  weakness,  and  numbness)  caused  by  a  chronic  illness  which \nsubstantially limits one or more life activity, including but not limited to walking.  Mr. Follmer’s \ncondition is progressive in nature.  From 2007 to 2012, Mr. Follmer used a cane to assist with \nmobility and in 2013, FDOC provided him with a wheelchair and wheelchair assistant.  \n341.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants. Mr. Follmer was \ntransferred to Santa Rosa Correctional Institution in 2014 and placed in Close Management, a \nsolitary  confinement  unit,  at  which  point  FDOC  confiscated  his  wheelchair.    Mr.  Follmer \ncomplained about the confiscation of his wheelchair at a prison ADA meeting and instead of \nbeing provided with his wheelchair, Mr. Follmer was simply removed from the ADA list at \nSanta Rosa from September of 2014 to April of 2015.     \n342.  On May 4, 2015, Mr. Follmer filed a grievance regarding his wheelchair.  Mr. \nFollmer claimed that his mobility has gotten worse since he has been made to use a walker rather \nthan a wheelchair.  FDOC denied his grievance stating, “a review of your records suggests that a \nwheelchair is not needed at this time.  While you are a CM (Close Management) inmate, the \nwalker you currently have is deemed to be adequate and appropriate for your use at this time.”  \n- 90 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 91 of 123\nMr. Follmer made several additional attempts to get his wheelchair returned, all of which were \ndenied.   \n343.  Without his wheelchair, Mr. Follmer has had difficulty gaining access to services \nand activities.  For example, on February 23, 2015, Mr. Follmer filed an informal grievance \nregarding an incident in the medical office.  Mr. Follmer was advised to stand on a scale.  He \ntold the nurse that he would not be able to get an accurate weight since he was unable to stand \nwithout the walker and would need to put his weight on the walker for support.  Rather than \naccommodating Mr. Follmer, the nurse simply documented that Mr. Follmer refused to be \nweighed.    His  grievance  was  denied  stating,  “Treatment  was  adequate  and  if  want  to  be \nreevaluated sick call is available.” Mr. Follmer appealed and his grievance was again denied.  A \nsimilar incident took place in May 2015 wherein Mr. Follmer was again not able to stand on the \nscale and a proper weight was not able to be obtained.  Due to the nature of Mr. Follmer’s \nillness,  maintaining  a  proper  weight  is  an  integral  part  of  his  treatment  thereby  making  it \nessential to obtain.   \n344.  Mr. Follmer rarely leaves his housing unit because it is so difficult for him to \nambulate.  This further exacerbates the consequences of the extreme isolation he has been put in.  \nIn fact, Mr. Follmer reported that he has asked to be taken out of certain mental health groups \nbecause it is too difficult for him to get there. \nJames Lunt \n345.  James Lunt is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  Mr. \nLunt has Crohn’s disease,13 as well as lumbar and cervical degenerative disease as a result of a \n                         \n13 Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease which causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract \nthat can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition.  Inflammation caused by \nCrohn's  disease  can  involve  different  areas  of  the  digestive  tract  in  different  people.    See \nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/basics/definition/con-20032061 (last visited January \n19, 2016). \n- 91 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 92 of 123\ncar accident prior to incarceration.  He can ambulate to some degree, but can only walk very \nshort distances, and for that reason spends most of the day using a wheelchair.  His conditions \nsubstantially limit several major life activities, including but not limited to caring for oneself, \nperforming manual tasks, eating, walking, standing, lifting, and bending.  Mr. Lunt has been \ndesignated as a mobility impaired inmate by the FDOC. His disabilities are well documented in \nhis medical and administrative records by FDOC.  FDOC has had full knowledge that Mr. Lunt \nis disabled and requires accommodations.  Moreover, every day Mr. Lunt sits in a wheelchair. \n346.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities. When Mr. Lunt first arrived \nin Suwannee C.I., he was placed in a dorm which did not provide equitable access for inmates \nwith disabilities.  For example, at Suwannee C.I. there is an insufficient number of handicapped \naccessible toilets.  The one handicapped stall in the bathroom is often taken over by other \nprisoners without disabilities.  As a result, the stall is constantly.  FDOC does not ensure that it is \nreadily available for use by wheelchair users.  \n347.  The shower bench at Suwanee C.I. does not have a slip resistant pad; this causes \nthe people using it to fall off the bench.  Moreover, the benches are too far away from the shower \nhead, so that Mr. Lunt cannot use it.  He requested the shower head be extended, but that \nmodification occurred in another dorm, and Mr. Lunt must use a cup to rinse off his body while \nshowering. \n348.  At  Suwanee  C.I.,  Mr.  Lunt  is  not  afforded  any  privacy  when  using  the \nhandicapped shower stall.  The stalls are in plain view of other inmates and the guards, and there \nis no privacy screen.  Mr. Lunt tries to move the trash barrel in front of the shower stall to block \nthe view of others, but sometimes the guards tell him to move the barrel. The abled bodied \ninmates can shower behind a half wall which blocks the view of the lower half of their bodies.  \n- 92 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 93 of 123\nMr. Lunt grieved the lack of shower privacy in January 2015 and was told by FDOC that the \nshowers are ADA compliant, and they have no obligation to provide him a privacy screen. \n349.  The dining halls at Suwanee C.I. have insufficient seating for wheelchair users.  \nInmates with disabilities must wait, often outside without cover, until a seat is available for their \nwheelchair.  Inmates with disabilities wait longer to eat than the abled bodied inmates. In \nOctober 2013, Mr. Lunt sat at a non-wheelchair accessible table so that he could avoid the long \nwait the disabled inmates endure. He was berated by two officers for sitting where he did not \nbelong. Mr. Lunt grieved the treatment, but it was denied.  \n350.  Mr. Lunt also grieved the insufficient number of wheelchair accessible tables in \nthe dining hall in November 2013.  Although not all the wheelchair-using prisoners are sent to \nthe dining hall at once, there are still approximately 70 inmates in wheelchairs, who must wait in \nline for the approximately 14 wheelchair accessible seats.  This results in a huge back up, which \nis exacerbated by inmates who have slow eating passes that require even more time to eat. Mr. \nLunt must wheel himself to the dining hall, and because he moves slower than other inmates, \nthere are already 15-20 wheelchair users in line once he arrives.  As a result, there have been \ntimes where he has been unable to finish his meal before the end of dining time because of the \nlong time waiting for an accessible seat to become available.   \n351.  Due to Mr. Lunt’s Crohn’s disease, he has been granted an Early Chow and Slow \nEat pass, he also has an order for a low residue/low soy diet.  Although these passes were \nawarded approximately 15 years ago, Suwanee will no longer honor the passes.  The FDOC tells \nMr. Lunt “We are not making one special meal for you” and “If medical ordered something for \nyou, then medical should pay for it too.” \n352.  At Suwanee C.I., Mr. Lunt is excluded from recreational activities on the yard.  \n- 93 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 94 of 123\nThe facilities offer only a cement sidewalk to a pavilion, where the handicapped seats are \nlimited.  The walking track is made of dirt which prohibits inmates in wheelchairs from using it, \nor risk destroying their wheelchairs and tires.  The abled bodied inmates are allowed to enjoy a \nnumber of activities while the inmates in wheelchairs are limited to travel to and from the \npavilion. \n353.  Due to Mr. Lunt’s Crohn’s disease he must frequently use the restroom, and \nsometimes the need to use the restroom comes on quickly. The FDOC gave Mr. Lunt a pass for a \nsingle man/handicapped cell. However, at Martin C.I., Everglades C.I. and Suwanee C.I., his \nrequests to be housed in a handicapped accessible cell were denied, or he was told he must wait \nuntil a handicapped cell is available for him.  He was at Suwanee C.I. for two years before he \nwas given an accessible cell. \n354.  While housed in the open dorm areas there was insufficient space for the 15 \ninmates using wheelchairs, and the hallways did not afford enough room for him to turn in his \nwheelchair.  These issues not only caused access issues but also safety concerns.  Moreover, the \nTV rooms at Suwannee are not large enough to accommodate the able bodied inmates and the 15 \ninmates using wheel chairs.  The inmates in wheelchairs are forced to sit in the back of the TV \nroom, making it difficult or impossible to view or hear the small television. \n355.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants. Mr. Lunt requested \nan aid to help push his wheelchair so that he can navigate through prison in a timely way, and \nremain safe.   Although the FDOC granted his request, the aids are not properly trained or vetted.  \nMr. Lunt was assigned aids who tried to extort him.  To remove a particular aid, Mr. Lunt must \nrelinquish his aid request, which results in unreasonable delays. \n356.  Engaging  in  Retaliation  or  Interference.  Mr.  Lunt  has  filed  a  number  of \n- 94 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 95 of 123\ngrievances in an attempt to improve the conditions of his incarceration, and as a result has been \nthreatened by FDOC staff.  On February 4, 2015, Captain Brennend threatened Mr. Lunt by \ntelling him “I don’t want to hear any more grievances, if I do you know what to expect.”  In \nFebruary 2015, Mr. Lunt’s grievance documentation, attorney mail, medical records and other \ndocuments were confiscated as contraband.  Mr. Lunt immediately filed a request seeking the \nreturn of his documentation.   Even though FDOC rules require confiscated materials to be kept \nfor at least 30 days, he was eventually told that his documents were destroyed. \n357.  Engaging in Retaliation and Interference. Upon information and belief, after \nPlaintiff began investigating the violations within the FDOC, the FDOC started conducting ADA \nreview meetings.  Mr. Lunt has attended some of them; however, the meetings do not result in a \nresolution of ADA issues.  Moreover, inmates are required to sign “refusal” forms, ostensibly \naffirming that they have no ADA issues.  Signing the form is not optional, whether inmates have \nADA issues or not.   \nNick Molfetto \n358.  Nick Molfetto is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe has degenerative disc disease, diabetes, and his right and left legs are different lengths. \nAlthough Mr. Molfetto can stand and walk to some degree, he requires braces and a wheelchair \nto move through the prison safely.  Due to his size, Mr. Molfetto uses a large wheelchair which \nis 20 inches wide, which creates more problems for him in the FDOC facilities.  His conditions \nsubstantially limit several major life activities, including but not limited to walking, standing, \nlifting, and bending.  Mr. Molfetto has been designated as a mobility impaired inmate by the \nFDOC. His disabilities are well documented in his medical and administrative records by FDOC, \ntherefore FDOC has had full knowledge that Mr. Molfetto has a disability.  Moreover, every day \n- 95 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 96 of 123\nhe sits in a wheelchair. \n359.  Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities. Mr. Molfetto is currently \nhoused at Columbia C.I., and has been at that facility for approximately two years.  He is \ncurrently housed in the P-1 Dorm.  At Columbia C.I. there are 15 disabled inmates who must \nshare one handicapped accessible urinal, and one handicapped toilet stall. The handicapped \naccessible urinal was broken for approximately two years, and was just repaired in December \n2015. There is not sufficient toileting accommodations for the inmates with disabilities who \nrequire longer time for toileting, which forces others to wait a long time to use the toilet. \n360.  The showering facilities at Columbia C.I. are not accessible to Mr. Molfetto \nbecause there are not sufficient grab bars.  The handicapped shower stall is filthy, and there is \nmold on the shower walls.  He will not use the handicapped accessible shower stall for this \nreason and instead showers in the non-accessible shower stall and holds himself up by using the \nwall. \n361.  At Columbia C.I., if you want to use a shower wand, you must go to the officer’s \nbooth and sign it out.  Carrying a wand while moving in a wheel chair is not easy, and cannot be \nperformed by some disabled inmates.  Columbia C.I. also allows disabled inmates to sign out a \nplastic privacy screen which can be used to block the view of the shower stall. However, this \nscreen must also be signed out and many inmates in wheelchairs cannot drag the screen into the \nbathroom because it is approximately 4 feet long and 5 feet high. \n362.  Except  during  breakfast,  the  dining  halls  at  Columbia  C.I.  have  insufficient \nseating for wheelchair users.  Inmates with disabilities must wait, often outside without cover, \nuntil a seat is available for their wheelchair.  Inmates with disabilities wait longer to eat than the \nabled bodied inmates. In approximately July 2015, Mr. Molfetto filed a grievance about being \n- 96 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 97 of 123\nforced to wait outside, but has not yet received a response.  Some of the handicapped accessible \ntables in the dining hall are located in an area that causes Mr. Molfetto to block the beverage \nmachine if he eats there.  If this occurs the guards will yell at Mr. Molfetto to move while he is \neating.  The guards also yell at the disabled inmates to “hurry up,” “get out,” and tells them they \nare “sitting too long.”  They yell because they need the handicapped accessible seats to be freed \nup for use by other prisoners using wheelchairs.  \n363.  There is insufficient aisle width in P-1 Dorm in between the beds for Mr. Molfetto \nto turn his wheelchair.  This barrier impacts Mr. Molfetto’s ability to move throughout the dorm, \nand affects his ability to leave the area in case of an emergency. \n364.  At Columbia C.I. Mr. Molfetto is excluded from activities on the yard.  The \nfacility offers only a cement sidewalk to a pavilion, where the handicapped seats are limited.  \nThe able-bodied inmates are allowed to enjoy basketball and flag football, while the inmates in \nwheelchairs are limited to travel to and from the pavilion.  Mr. Molfetto can walk around the \ntrack holding a cane or his wheelchair, but cannot access any other activity. \n365.  The FDOC refuses or delays transfers of inmates to facilities closer to their \nfamilies because they have disabilities.  In 2013, Mr. Molfetto was transferred from a facility \nclose to Tampa (where his family lives) to Columbia C.I.  Upon information and belief, he was \ntransferred because he uses a wheelchair.  Mr. Molfetto requested a transfer from Columbia C.I. \nto a facility closer to Tampa, but at least 15 months have passed and he still has received no \ntransfer.  He was told the delay was because he uses a wheelchair.  \n366.  In 2012, Mr. Molfetto was fitted for $10,000 customized bilateral metal braces for \nhis legs. The braces support his knees and helped him walk longer, and more safely. When he \nwas  transferred  from  RMC  to  Florida  State  Prison  in  2013,  the  FDOC  took  away  these \n- 97 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 98 of 123\ncustomized braces and destroyed them, claiming they could be used as weapons.  Mr. Molfetto \ngrieved the removal and destruction of the braces and was told because they were made of metal \nhe could not keep the braces. \nRichard Jackson \n367.  Richard Jackson is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  \nHe  has  paraparesis,  a  condition  that  causes  paralysis  of  the  lower  limbs.    The  condition \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not limited to walking, caring \nfor himself, standing, performing manual tasks, working, and using the bathroom.  He requires a \nwheelchair for mobility.   \n368.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants.  Mr. Jackson has \nused a wheelchair for mobility since he entered the FDOC system in 1993.  When Mr. Jackson \nwas  moved  to  Santa  Rosa  Correctional  Institution  in  October  2012,  he  was  put  in  close \nmanagement (CM), a form of solitary confinement.   FDOC permits medical personnel to \ndisallow accommodations such as wheelchairs that have already been deemed necessary by other \nstaff.   \n369.  This policy was applied to Mr. Jackson.  Although prison officials had deemed a \nwheelchair necessary and permitted Mr. Jackson to have and use one at other facilities and at \nSanta Rosa C.I. outside his cell, FDOC’s policy permitted Santa Rosa C.I. officials to take away \nMr. Jackson’s wheelchair while inside his CM cell.   \n370.  From October 2012 through December 2013, Mr. Jackson was not permitted to \nhave his wheelchair in his CM cell.  He was forced to drag himself across the dirty and abrasive \ncell floor, where it was very difficult to transfer to the bed, toilet, and wash basin.  Because he \nwas on CM, he was confined alone to his cell for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except that \n- 98 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 99 of 123\nhe was permitted to leave his cell for one hour, three times per week.   \n371.  In April 2013, Mr. Jackson filed a pro se lawsuit complaining of these degrading \nconditions.  \n372.  In December 2013, Mr. Jackson was transferred to Northwest Florida Reception \nCenter.  He was promptly physically assaulted by a guard who had been instructed to do so by a \ndefendants named in Mr. Jackson’s pro se lawsuit.  This was done as retaliation for asserting his \nrights under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Eighth Amendment.   \n373.  Mr. Jackson’s pro se lawsuit was dismissed, and then re-filed with counsel in \nOctober 2014.  The case was eventually settled in April 2015 for substantial damages and \nattorneys’ fees.   \nChristopher Villanueva \n374.  The FDOC does not permit some prisoners to have medically necessary prosthetic \ndevices.  Christopher Villanueva is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \ntimes.  As a result of an ATV accident and resulting infection, Mr. Villanueva’s left leg was \namputated below the knee.  That condition substantially limits one or more major life activity, \nincluding but not limited to walking.   Since 1993, he used a titanium and carbon fiber prosthesis \nfor mobility.  \n375.  Mr. Villanueva was first incarcerated in the FDOC from 2000 to 2005. During \nthat time, he had his prosthesis and was permitted to use it without any security incidents \nwhatsoever.  The prosthesis enabled Mr. Villanueva to access FDOC programs, services, and \nactivities in substantially the same way as the other prisoners without disabilities.  Further, using \nthe prosthesis enabled him to use the muscles in his left leg, which prevented atrophy and \nensured that the prosthesis would continue to fit properly.   \n- 99 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 100 of 123\n376.  Mr. Villanueva returned to the custody of the FDOC in March of 2012.  During \nhis intake process at RMC, his prosthesis was taken away from him without consultation with \nmedical staff.  Mr. Villanueva immediately began to file grievances requesting the return of his \nprosthesis, but they were all denied.   \n377.  Mr. Villanueva was forced to live without his prosthesis for nearly two years.  It \nwas only returned to him after Mr. Villanueva’s attorney began investigating.  However, as a \nresult of not having the prosthesis, his leg and entire left side of his body atrophied, and he lost \nsubstantial range of motion in his knee.  He also could not immediately use the prosthesis \nbecause it caused blistering on his leg from lack of use, and needed physical therapy to be able to \nuse it in the same way that he did before.   \n378.  Mr. Villanueva filed a lawsuit against the FDOC over this mistreatment.  The case \nsettled for substantial damages and attorneys’ fees.   \nRichard Tasker \n379.  Richard Tasker is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.    \nHe was in a motorcycle accident in 1973 that crushed his vertebrae, resulting in chronic cervical, \nthoracic, and lumbar pain which impedes his mobility.  Mr. Tasker’s left leg was amputated in \n2000 while in FDOC custody.  He uses a leg prosthesis and a wheelchair for limited mobility, \nand requires special shoes.  His mobility issues substantially limit several major life activities, \nincluding but not limited walking and caring for himself.  Mr. Tasker has been designated as a \nmobility impaired inmate by the FDOC.   \n380.  Failure to Provide and Maintain Wheelchairs and Assistants.  For approximately \neight years, Mr. Tasker used a 22 inch manual wheelchair which he purchased for himself. The \nwheelchair had a support cushion which was prescribed by an FDOC physician, and Mr. Tasker \n- 100 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 101 of 123\nhad used this chair to travel through prisons compounds.  It was an 8 year old chair and was \nworn but worked well for Mr. Tasker.   \n381.  In February 2014, his wheelchair was confiscated at Santa Rosa C.I. because it \nhad a tear in the cushion and a split on the back of the seat. FDOC staff ripped the cushion and \nthe  back  of  the  wheelchair  searching  for  contraband.  No  contraband  was  found.  After \nconfiscating  and  destroying  the  wheelchair,  the  FDOC  provided  Mr.  Tasker  with  a  semi-\noperable, 18 inch wheelchair without a cushion. The wheelchair was too small for him, and the \nabsence of the cushion further aggravated his documented back and leg pain.  He grieved the \nconfiscation and destruction of his wheelchair, and his grievance was denied. \n382.  One year later, in approximately February 2015, Mr. Tasker again grieved the \nconfiscation of his wheelchair and asked for the chair back.  The wheelchair was eventually \ngiven back to him, but most of the parts that were on the wheelchair before it was confiscated \nhad been removed and replaced with inferior parts from other wheelchairs. Mr. Tasker is now \nusing an FDOC issued wheel chair that is too big, has no cushion, and does not allow him to \nmove himself easily with his one leg. \n383.  Mr. Tasker’s records show a history of him grieving, requesting, and appealing \nthe failure to provide auxiliary aids to assist with his mobility impairments.  Mr. Tasker has one \nleg, and uses a wheelchair for mobility.  To move his wheelchair he relies on his one leg for \nmomentum, causing him to move slowly, and limiting the distance he can travel without resting.  \nThe prison compounds are large, and inmates are required to arrive at certain buildings at \ndesignated times or face reprimand.  Mr. Tasker has endured a great deal of emotional stress \ntrying to adhere to time schedules because he is physically unable to arrive at certain locations as \nrequired.  Mr. Tasker’s records reflect he has requested both a wheelchair pusher and or an aid \n- 101 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 102 of 123\napproximately 4 times since March 2014.  When an aid is provided, they are not properly vetted \nfor the assignment; other times they are denied. \n384.  In 2012, Mr. Tasker filed at least two grievances concerning his pusher, who \nwasn’t doing his job for years and threatened to assault him.   \n385.  On  November  8,  2014,  he  grieved  the  absence  of  a  wheelchair  pusher  and \nexplained the difficulty he had pushing himself, especially when handcuffed.  FDOC responded \nby falsely telling Mr. Tasker that he had been pushed by staff.  Mr. Tasker was not pushed by \nstaff.  When Mr. Tasker does receive a wheelchair pusher, the help is inconsistent.  And if he is \ntransferred, FDOC fails to ensure that he has a pusher at his new institution, requiring Mr. Tasker \nto grieve the absence of a wheelchair pusher all over again.   \n386.  Failure  to  Maintain  Wheelchair  Accessible  Facilities.  Mr.  Tasker  also  has \nexperienced a number of structural barriers that have impeded his access at several prisons. \nThese barriers are exacerbated by his ongoing issues with maintaining his leg prosthesis.  He \ncurrently has his prosthesis, which he was told cost thousands of dollars to make, but the FDOC \nhas failed to provide him with the $100 shoes needed to use it.  As a result, he is unable to use \nthe prosthesis.  His prosthesis allows him to stand erect and walk for up to one hour, and when \nproperly medicated he can stand for almost half the day. \n387.  Mr. Tasker has also been housed in dorms and cells that are not wheelchair \naccessible.  \n388.  In October 2013, Mr. Tasker filed grievances at Mayo C.I. because the cells in the \nnewer buildings were not wide enough to accommodate his wheelchair. FDOC then moved him \nto another dorm which was worse.  The second dorm did not have the required wheelchair \nclearance to allow him to safely get in and out of the area. \n- 102 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 103 of 123\n389.  Mr. Tasker has also experienced ongoing access barriers in the bathrooms at \nseveral correctional facilities including RMC, Mayo, and Franklin. Mr. Tasker has one leg, and \nto safely and efficiently use the shower he must be able to get himself out of his wheelchair and \nthen temporarily stand on his one leg, or sit on a shower bench.  Often the shower benches are \nbroken or placed too far away from the water source so that if he sits on the bench he cannot \nposition under the shower head.  \n390.  At Franklin, RMC, CFRC, and Tomoka C.I., the shower wand hose is too short to \nbe used.  At Mayo C.I. there was no shower wand. Without appropriate benches or wands, Mr. \nTasker is forced to stand on his one leg while showering, which is not safe. At Franklin and \nTomoka C.I., instead of having grab bars, the shower stall is equipped with a grab rail which fills \nwith water, making it unsanitary and unsafe.  \n391.  At Franklin, Tomoka, and Mayo, Mr. Tasker was not afforded any privacy when \nusing the handicapped shower stall. The stalls are in plain view of other inmates and the guards, \nand there is no privacy screen. While showering, Mr. Tasker tries to position his wheelchair to \nblock the view of others, but sometimes the guards tell him to move the wheelchair. The \nprisoners without mobility impairments are afforded the ability to shower behind a half wall \nwhich blocks the view of the lower half of their bodies.   \n392.  In Mr. Tasker’s dorm at RMC, there are no handicapped shower stalls. This has \nforced Mr. Tasker to wheel himself into the main shower area to a location which he can fit his \nwheelchair.    But  the  main  shower  area  is  not  equipped  with  the  proper  grab  bars  or \naccommodations. \n393.  At Franklin and Tomoka C.I., Mr. Tasker is excluded from activities on the yard.  \nThe facilities offer only a cement sidewalk to a pavilion, where the handicapped seats are \n- 103 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 104 of 123\nlimited.  The walking track is made from dirt and cannot be used with a wheelchair.  The abled \nbodied  inmates  are  allowed  to  enjoy  football,  hand  weights  and  other  activities,  while  the \ninmates in wheelchairs are limited to travel to and from the pavilion.  Mr. Tasker requested a \nchess set be provided for the pavilion, but that request was denied \n394.  The dining halls at Tomoka, Franklin, Mayo and Santa Rosa have insufficient \nseating for wheelchair users.  Inmates with disabilities must wait, often outside without cover, \nuntil a seat is available for their wheelchair.  Some of the wheelchair accessible tables are located \nin areas which block access for abled bodied inmates to beverage areas or trash receptacles.  \nOfficers yell at the inmates using wheelchairs to move out of the way while they are eating.  Due \nto the fact that Mr. Tasker can’t hear the commands, he is sometimes approached by the officers \nand berated for ignoring their commands. \nPrisoners Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision \nEarvin Ealy \n395.  Earvin Ealy is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant times.  He \nis legally blind which substantially limits several major life activities, including but not limited \nto seeing.  Mr. Ealy became blind later in life, when he was 36 years old, and has not been \ntrained to read Braille.  Mr. Ealy has been designated as an impaired inmate by the FDOC, and \nhis  vision  loss  is  well  documented  in  his  medical  and  administrative  records  by  FDOC. \nTherefore, FDOC has had full knowledge that Mr. Ealy is blind and requires accommodations. \nMoreover he wears a badge every day in the prison which says he is BLIND. \n396.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Mr. Early has been repeatedly \ndenied auxiliary aids and services that have precluded him from accessing numerous FDOC \nprograms, services, and activities.  For example, FDOC law libraries have printed books and \n- 104 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 105 of 123\noffer electronic computer research.  Mr.  Ealy cannot read printed text, and the law libraries at \nhis institutions are not equipped with speech-to-text software or other accommodations that \nallow computer text to be read out loud.  Therefore, Mr. Ealy cannot independently access the \nlaw library as other inmates can.  \n397.  Mr. Ealy wanted to use the law library to assist in understanding his rights as a \nblind prisoner, and assist in the prosecution of his civil cases.  Because he was not able to access \nthe  law  library  independently,  Mr.  Ealy  could  not  meaningfully  assist  with  his  cases  or \nindependently represent himself in civil cases filed to protect his federal rights. Due to these \nbarriers, Mr. Ealy had to pay aids to draft and read printed material for him, and some of the aids \ndid not possess the required literacy to effectively assist him.   \n398.  In 2012, Mr. Ealy requested a text-to-speech wand which can be used to scan a \nprinted  word  and  read  it  out  loud  to  him.  That  request  was  denied,  and  no  alternate \naccommodation was provided.  Unable to access printed text in the library and in his personal \nletters, Mr. Ealy requested an aid14 who could sit with him, read legal research off the computer, \nand read and write for him.  At times, Readers were provided, but often they were ineffective.  \nAt Gulf C.I. and Columbia C.I., his requests for a Reader were either denied, or they were only \nprovided after he grieved their absence. When the Readers were provided, they were often \nunwilling or unable to fulfill the role of an accommodation for Mr. Ealy.  Sometimes they would \nbegin their task, but then leave early, leaving Mr. Ealy stranded in the library.  In 2014, for \nexample, a Reader was assigned to Mr. Ealy who did not fully speak English, and did not possess \nthe reading competency required to relay the content of the legal information on the computer.  \n                         \n14 Mr. Ealy used the term aid in his Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Requests and grievances because \nhe was seeking an accommodation that could both assist in accessing printed material (reading and writing it), and \nassist him in other ways. Mr. Ealy was essentially seeking a Qualified Reader.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  Inherent in \nthe role of a Reader is the concurrent service of a Scrivener, who takes notes and writes for others. \n- 105 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 106 of 123\n399.  Oftentimes the assigned Readers demand some form of payment from Mr. Ealy, \nsuch as money, items from the commissary, food from his tray, or other favors.  Sometimes, the \nother prisoners take the payment without providing the assistance.  Moreover, when Mr. Ealy is \nin confinement, his ability to access printed materials becomes even more tenuous, because aids \nare not allowed to stay with Mr. Ealy while confined. \n400.  Mr. Ealy filed several grievances about his lack of access to printed material and \ncomputer based information, however the FDOC has failed to accommodate him.  \n401.  The FDOC has also failed to ensure that prisoners with visual disabilities can \naccess the grievance system.  Although there is a written policy allowing verbal requests, they \nare not accepted in practice.  Mr. Ealy has asked to submit requests and complaints verbally and \nwas told verbal requests are prohibited.  Similarly, to request disability-related accommodations, \nMr. Ealy has been told he must submit a written Reasonable Modification or Accommodation \nRequest form because verbal requests are prohibited.  Mr. Ealy thus has no way to access the \ngrievance system privately and independently, as other sighted inmates can.  \n402.  Thus, to use the grievance system, Mr. Ealy has been forced to rely on other \nprisoners. This assistance has not always been free; other prisoners have demanded payment in \nthe form of money, food, canteen items, or other favors.  The other inmates do not always fill out \nthe forms correctly, and are not always available.  This caused great stress to Mr. Ealy and \ncaused him to miss grievance deadlines since 2007. \n403.  Moreover,  the  FDOC  requires  prisoners  to  sign  various  forms  during  their \nincarceration, such as medical consent and authorization documents.  These forms are only \navailable in printed text, which prevents Mr. Ealy from having independent access to his medical \ninformation and the ability to understand medical consents prior to execution.  Prisoners like Mr. \n- 106 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 107 of 123\nEaly are required most of the time to sign forms immediately in a staff member’s presence, \nwhich affords Mr. Ealy no time to have someone explain the content of the form to him.  Thus, \nthroughout his incarceration, Mr. Ealy has refused to sign medical forms and consent forms \nbecause he is unable to understand their content.   \n404.  Moreover, other sighted prisoners can access recreational books and newspapers. \nThis  material  is  provided  to  the  inmates  only  through  printed  text.    Prisoners  with  visual \ndisabilities like Mr. Ealy cannot access these materials.   \n405.  From 2007 to 2013, Mr. Ealy had a digital audio player used to listen to audio \nbooks.  During that period, he was allowed to write to the Bureau of Blind Services who \nprovided catalogs of audio materials that Mr. Ealy used to select permissible books to hear. \nDuring this period, he was also allowed to receive audio books from his family.   In January \n2014, however, while at Gulf C.I., his audio player was taken from him, because the FDOC \nalleged that his family had somehow violated a rule for selecting audio books.  The confiscation \nof the audio player was a surprise to Mr. Ealy because his family had been using the same \nprocess to order audio books for some time, and was not advised the process was prohibited. The \naudio player has not been returned, and his family has been prohibited from sending more audio \nbooks.   Mr. Ealy filed a grievance about it in February 2014, but it was denied.   \n406.  The  FDOC  has  also  failed  to  ensure  that  prison  facilities  are  structurally \naccessible to Mr. Ealy.  Throughout his incarceration, Mr. Ealy has requested to be housed in a \ntwo-person cell that accommodates his vison loss.  At Columbia C.I., where he is currently \nhoused, and at Gulf C.I., where he was before, those requests were denied.  Mr. Ealy has instead \nbeen housed in an open bay dorm,15 at times with an inmate aid.  However, his aid’s bunk is far \n                         \n15  An open bay dorm is one in which the prisoners do not sleep in cells.  Rather, they sleep in multiple bunk beds \nthat are set up in the middle of the dorm, and are generally free to move about the dorm, with some restrictions.  \n- 107 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 108 of 123\nfrom Mr. Ealy’s, and thus it is difficult for Mr. Ealy to get assistance when needed.  For \nexample, Mr. Ealy is unable to use the restroom at night, because it would be unsafe for him to \ncall out for his aid. \n407.  In a two person cell, Mr. Ealy can independently and safely get in and out of his \nbed, use the restroom, and access his locker.  All of Mr. Ealy’s grievances and requests asking to \nbe put in a two person cell in 2014 and 2015 were denied.  \n408.  Due to the size of the prison compounds where Mr. Ealy has been incarcerated, he \nhas also requested an aid to help him navigate through the buildings in a timely way. At times \nMr. Ealy was provided an aid, but the aids would refuse to assist him or fail to appear when \nneeded. At other times he was denied an aid completely. \n409.  Due to FDOC’s failure to provide Mr. Ealy with an effective aid, Mr. Ealy has \nmissed meal calls in 2014 and 2015 because he was unable to independently get to the dining \nhall on time. \n410.  In March 2014, Mr. Ealy was left behind during a fire drill because his aid failed \nto retrieve him. \n411.  The FDOC has failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Ealy’s requests.  \n412.  Exclusion from Jobs and Programs. Mr. Ealy is eligible for both a faith based \ndorm  placement  and  work  release,  but  has  been  denied  such  opportunities  because  of  his \nblindness.  In 2015, he was denied after being told there were not enough “ADA rooms” for him.     \n413.  Engaging in Retaliation or Interference. Mr. Ealy is known as a “writ writer.”  \nThis is a pejorative term the FDOC uses to describe prisoners who attempt to improve the \nconditions of their incarceration with the established grievance system and filing lawsuits.  At \nGulf C.I., Okeechobee C.I., and Dade C.I., he has been given false DRs and unjustly put in \n- 108 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 109 of 123\nconfinement because he frequently complains about the lack of disability accommodations.  At \nGulf  C.I.,  Mr.  Ealy  was  threatened  by  the  assistant  warden  not  to  go  over  his  head  with \ngrievances  or  there  would  be  trouble.    FDOC  staff  have  told  him  similar  things  at  other \ninstitutions.      \nCharles Grossman \n414.  Charles Grossman is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \ntimes.  He is blind, which substantially limits one or more major life activity, including but not \nlimited to seeing.  Mr. Grossman has a rare condition which caused retinal detachment in both \neyes and he has undergone numerous complex surgeries.  He is completely blind in the right eye \nand can only see shadows with the left.     \n415.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  Mr. Grossman utilizes various \nassistive devices to accommodate his disability.  FDOC has provided some, but not all, of these \naccommodations. However, FDOC has failed to ensure that they are provided consistently.  On \nJune 19, 2013, Mr. Grossman submitted a request to Nurse Lytle at Gulf Correctional Institution \nAnnex stating, “As an impaired inmate I am instructed to talk to you monthly regarding my \nconditions that prohibit me from functioning as an inmate without any physical challenges. This \nhas not been done since I returned from Lake Butler in January.  I have been down in the Gulf 19 \nmonths and the only thing I have received is a tap stick and key lock.”16   Even these devices \nwere taken from Grossman at Reception Medical Center and only the white cane was replaced.  \nFDOC responded on June 26, 2013, and stated that Mr. Grossman’s concerns were addressed \nand that he would be seen again in 30 days.   \n                         \n16 A tap stick or white cane is a long rod-like device used by blind or visually impaired travelers to give them infor-\nmation about the environment they are traveling through. Using a cane can warn them of obstacles in their path, tell \nthem of stairs they are coming to, warn them that they are coming up to a curb, and tell them of many other things in \nthe environment that they must deal with. The cane also alerts others around them that they are blind.  See, e.g., Na-\ntional Federation for the Blind, https://nfb.org/free-cane-program (last visited January 7, 2016).   \n \n- 109 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 110 of 123\n416.  Mr. Grossman’s concerns were not in fact addressed. On July 10, 2013, Mr. \nGrossman appealed and claimed that FDOC has failed to provide the “necessary equipment \nwhich would allow me to function as a normal inmate.”  Mr. Grossman alleged that he has not \nyet received any responses to his requests for the following: a key lock pass, books on tape, a \nwatch for the blind, and a controlled environment with a voice recorder so he may dictate his \nletters. This grievance was returned.    \n417.  FDOC occasionally uses inmate assistants to assist other inmates with disabilities, \nyet fails to ensure that they and FDOC staff are carrying out their duties effectively and safely.  \nFor example, on October 19, 2012, Mr. Grossman had to be seen in the FDOC Emergency Room \nbecause he walked into a shelf and hit his head while being guided by another inmate.    \n418.  On July 15, 2013, Mr. Grossman filed a grievance against two officers at Gulf \nCorrectional Institution who put him in harm’s way.  Classification Officer Young kept saying \nthat Mr. Grossman could see, and Officer Cutchen made Mr. Grossman walk on a yellow line \nwith his assistant behind him.  The assistant cannot guide him from behind.   This grievance was \nreturned since Mr. Grossman did not provide a copy of the formal grievance.  \n419.  In August 2013, Mr. Grossman was transferred temporarily to Reception and \nMedical Center for care.  Officer Moore on the West Unit would not allow Mr. Grossman’s \nvolunteer assistant to help him with his tray.  FDOC informed Mr. Grossman that the West unit \n“does not have orderlies that are trained to assist with special needs inmates.”    \n420.  Mr.  Grossman  has  continued  to  have  trouble  securing  an  impaired  inmate \nassistant at his current institution, Franklin Correctional Institution.  He arrived at Franklin in \nNovember 2014.  Since then, Mr. Grossman has had more than five different assistants.  The \nassistants were either released, transferred to a different prison, sent to solitary confinement or \n- 110 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 111 of 123\nrefused to actually assist Mr. Grossman.  Between each assistant, Mr. Grossman was forced to \nget around the grounds on his own or rely on the kindness of other inmates to help him, many of \nwhom refused to assist him.  Earlier in 2015 at Franklin Correctional Institution, Mr. Grossman \nput his hand on another inmate’s shoulder and asked to be guided to the dining hall.  The other \ninmate yelled at Mr. Grossman stating, “Get your hands off me.”  \n421.  To date, Mr. Grossman is still not receiving the other accommodations that he \nneeds.  In fact, his tap stick had broken – one third of the cane had broken off of the bottom, \nrendering it almost useless to Mr. Grossman and posing a safety risk.  It was not until Mr. \nGrossman enlisted outside intervention was his tap stick was replaced in November 2015. \n422.  The  law  library  is  not  accessible  to  Mr.  Grossman.    On  June  5,  2015,  Mr. \nGrossman  filed  a  grievance  (written  by  another  inmate)  asking  that  Franklin  Correctional \nInstitution  “accommodate  the  library  with  a  recording  device/cassette  in  order  for  me \n[Grossman]  to  have  equal  effective  communication  with  my  lawyer.”    His  grievance  was \nreturned on June 18, 2015 and Mr. Grossman was instructed to file a Reasonable Modification or \nAccommodation Request and that, “[y]ou will be put on the call out for classification to assist \nyou is completing this form.”  Several months passed, and Mr. Grossman had not been called \nout, had not been given the form and reported that he did not even know who his classification \nofficer is.   Finally, in November 2015, Mr. Grossman’s classification officer assisted him with \nthe form and Mr. Grossman is awaiting FDOC’s response.   The law library is still not accessible \nto Mr. Grossman.  \n423.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Grossman’s requests.   \nKenneth Lamkin \n424.  Kenneth Lamkin is incarcerated in the FDOC system and was at all relevant \n- 111 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 112 of 123\ntimes. He has the progressive disease macular degeneration, which substantially limits one or \nmore major life activity, including but not limited to seeing.   \n425.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids and Services.  At the end of January 2012, Mr. \nLamkin was struck in the face and injured by another prisoner.  He was then transferred to Mayo \nCorrectional Institution for his protection in February 2012.   At Mayo, Mr. Lamkin requested an \nimpaired inmate assistant to help him with his daily activities.  He submitted a request to that \neffect on July 12, 2012.   FDOC denied his request, telling Mr. Lamkin that he does not need an \nassistant and that “You [Lamkin] can use orderlies in the library to assist you with reading and \nwriting. You are able to go to bathroom & lunch on your own.” Mr. Lamkin appealed and his \nrequest was again denied.    \n426.  On November 15, 2012, Mr. Lamkin again inquired about obtaining an impaired \ninmate assistant and asked for clarification on the procedure.  He was told that, “Mayo doesn’t \nhave the job code for assistants and your medical passes shows you don’t need an assistant.”  \n427.  At Mayo Correctional Institution, Mr. Lamkin has had a difficult time securing \nthe accommodations that had been granted at his previous institution such as a tape recorder and \nhis cane with a red tip.  Additionally, his glasses were broken during the attack.    \n428.  On September 17, 2013, Mr. Lamkin requested that he be provided a cane that has \nthe red tip which identifies him as a person with a visual disability.  This request was denied \nciting security as the reason.  Mr. Lamkin appealed and further elaborated on the safety concerns.  \nThe cane he was given is not for blind or visually impaired individuals and Mr. Lamkin can \neasily step out of line or veer off when walking.  On October 29, 2013, FDOC again denied his \nrequest.  Mr. Lamkin appealed to the FDOC Secretary and his grievance was returned.  \n429.  Mr. Lamkin submitted a Reasonable Modification or Accommodation Request on \n- 112 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 113 of 123\nSeptember 17, 2014, again requesting a proper cane with a red tip that would indicate that he is \nblind.  Mr. Lamkin was continuing to get bumped by security staff and other prisoners. On \nOctober 10, 2014, his request was again denied.   \n430.  In February 2015, Mr. Lamkin continued to seek the accommodations he had at \nhis previous institution, specifically a proper collapsible red tip cane and the prescription tinted \nglasses which were broken during a January 29, 2012 assault at Tomoka.  FDOC denied his \nrequests.  Mr. Lamkin was told that there was no medical reason for such a cane.  With respect to \nthe glasses, even though they were destroyed through no fault of Mr. Lamkin’s, he was told that \nhe can buy sunglasses at the canteen.  These would not be prescription and would of course be at \nhis own expense.  Mr. Lamkin has been at Mayo nearly four years and still has not received the \nproper glasses and cane.  Forcing him to pay for such an accommodation operates as an illegal \nsurcharge.  \n431.  The FDOC failed to give primary consideration to Mr. Lamkin’s requests.  \nFDOC’s Failure to Permit DOJ to Conduct Disability Investigation \n432.  In addition to its widespread failure to comply with laws protecting prisoners with \ndisabilities, the FDOC has also obstructed attempts by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to \ninvestigate FDOC’s noncompliance with disability laws.  \n433.  In exchange for the FDOC’s acceptance of federal financial assistance, FDOC is \nrequired to comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), and to permit DOJ to \ninspect its records and facilities to ascertain compliance.   \n434.  In  early  2013,  DOJ’s  Civil  Rights  Division  began  to  receive  complaints  of \nFDOC’s noncompliance with the RA and its implementing regulations.  On June 26, 2013, the \nDOJ sent a letter to FDOC notifying it that DOJ was conducting a compliance review to \n- 113 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 114 of 123\ndetermine  whether  FDOC  was  complying  with  its  RA  obligations  at  Tomoka  Correctional \nInstitution.    \n435.  The  FDOC  responded  in  September  2013,  notifying  DOJ  that  it  would  not \nconsent to any on-site inspections of its facilities, and advising that all interview requests would \nbe handled under the FDOC’s “Special Visit” rule and would be coordinated through FDOC.   \nThe DOJ responded in November 2013, providing the DOJ’s legal authority to conduct on-site \ninspections, and again requesting to conduct such inspections.    \n436.  The FDOC ignored the DOJ’s request for nearly two years, despite DOJ making \nseveral attempts to contact FDOC to schedule the visits.  On June 16, 2015, DOJ sent a findings \nletter to FDOC, notifying FDOC that it was in noncompliance with its obligations to cooperate \nwith the DOJ’s compliance review, and threatening litigation.   \n437.  As of the filing of this Complaint, the FDOC has still not permitted DOJ to \nconduct on-site inspections of its facilities, and still has not complied with its obligations under \nthe RA.   \nCOUNT 1 \nAmericans with Disabilities Act \n \n438.  This  count  is  brought  under  Title  II  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act \n(ADA),  42  U.S.C.  §  12101,  et  seq.  &  42  U.S.C.  §  12131,  et  seq.,  and  its  implementing \nregulations. \n439.

Defendant  has  a  pattern  and  practice  of  excluding  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities  from  participation  in,  and  denying  those  individuals  the  benefits  of  services, \n- 114 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 115 of 123\nprograms, and activities, by reason of those disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n442.  Defendant has a pattern and practice of subjecting qualified individuals with \ndisabilities to discrimination.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \n443.  Defendant has a pattern and practice of discriminating against prisoners because \nthey have opposed acts and practices made unlawful by the ADA, or because they have made \ncharges, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or \nhearing related to disability rights.  42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.134(a).  \n444.  Defendant has a pattern and practice of coercing, intimidating, threatening, and/or \ninterfering with prisoners’ exercise or enjoyment of their ADA rights, and doing so because \nprisoners have exercised or enjoyed their ADA rights or aided and encouraged others to do so.  \n42 U.S.C. § 12203(b); 28 C.F.R. § 35.134(b).   \n445.  Defendant fails to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with equal access \nand enjoyment of aids, services, and benefits.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n446.  Defendant  denies  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  the  opportunity  to \nparticipate in services, programs, or activities that are not separate or different.  28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(2).  \n447.  Defendant uses criteria or methods that have the effect of discriminating against \npersons with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n448.  Defendant  fails  to  make  reasonable  modifications  in  policies,  practices,  and \nprocedures  when  the  modifications  are  necessary  to  avoid  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \ndisability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n449.  Defendant uses eligibility criteria that tend to screen out people with disabilities.  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8). \n- 115 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 116 of 123\n450.

Defendant fails to maintain in operable working condition the features required \nfor programs, services, and activities to be readily accessible to individuals with disabilities.  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.133(a). \n452.  Defendant excludes inmates from participation in, and denies them the benefits of \nprograms, services, and activities, and subjects them to discrimination, because facilities are \ninaccessible and unusable by persons with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.149 & 35.152(b)(1). \n453.  Defendant fails to make programs, services, and activities readily accessible and \nusable to individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a). \n454.  Defendant fails to house inmates in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds; places inmates in inappropriate security classifications because no accessible cells or beds \navailable; places inmates in facilities that do not offer the same programming as other facilities; \nand deprives inmates with disabilities of visitation with family members by placing them in \ndistant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed.  28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2).  \n455.  Defendant fails to ensure that each inmate is housed in a cell with the accessible \nelements  necessary to  afford  the  inmate  access  to  safe,  appropriate  housing.    28  C.F.R.  § \n35.152(b)(3).  \n456.  Defendant fails to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary \nto  ensure  equal  participation  and  benefits  in  programs,  services,  activities.  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.160(b)(1). \n457.  Defendant fails to give primary consideration to the requests of individuals with \ndisabilities  in  determining  what  auxiliary  aids  and  services  are  necessary.  28  C.F.R.  § \n- 116 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 117 of 123\n35.160(b)(2).  \n458.  Defendant has known about the violations noted herein but has failed to correct \nthem, thereby exhibiting deliberate indifference to the rights of individuals in FDOC custody.   \n459.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  this  pattern,  practice,  and  deliberate \nindifference,  individuals  with  disabilities  in  FDOC  custody—Plaintiff’s  clients  and \nconstituents—have suffered, and continue to suffer from harm and violation of their ADA rights.  \nThese harms will continue unless enjoined by this Court.  \nCOUNT 2 \nRehabilitation Act \n \n460.  This count is brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. \n§ 701, et seq. & 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq.   \n461.  Defendant is a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794.   \n462.  Defendant  has  a  pattern  and  practice  of  excluding  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities from participation in, and denying those individuals the benefits of programs or \nactivities, solely by reason of the individuals’ disabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n463.  Defendant has a pattern and practice of subjecting qualified individuals with \ndisabilities to discrimination.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n464.

Defendant  fails to  insure  that  no  qualified  handicapped  person is  denied  the \nbenefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under its \nprograms  or  activities  because  Defendant’s  facilities  are  inaccessible  to  or  unusable  by \nhandicapped persons.  28 C.F.R. § 42.520. \n474.  Defendant has known about the violations noted herein but has failed to correct \n- 118 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 119 of 123\nthem, thereby exhibiting deliberate indifference to the rights of individuals in FDOC custody.   \n475.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  this  pattern,  practice,  and  deliberate \nindifference,  individuals  with  disabilities  in  FDOC  custody—Plaintiff’s  clients  and \nconstituents—have suffered, and continue to suffer from harm and violation of their RA rights.  \nThese harms will continue unless enjoined by this Court. \nCOUNT 3 \nEighth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n476.  This count is brought under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n477.  Defendant knows, and has known, that the persons in FDOC custody described \nherein suffer from serious medical needs, yet Defendant has failed and intentionally refused to \nprovide  the  necessary  aid  and  treatment  that  would  alleviate  those  serious  medical  needs.  \nDefendant has been deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of the persons in FDOC \ncustody.  While the Defendant has contracted with private entities to provide medical care, she \nnonetheless has a non-delegable duty to ensure adequate medical care for all prisoners in her \ncustody. \n478.  Defendant knows, and has known, of the substantial risk of serious harm, and \nactual  harms,  faced  by  persons  with  disabilities  in  FDOC  custody.    Yet  Defendant  has \ndisregarded, and continues to disregard, that risk and harms by failing and intentionally refusing \nto do anything that would remedy the situation.  Defendant has been deliberately indifferent to \nthe substantial risk of serious harm to the persons with disabilities in FDOC custody.   \n479.  Defendant knows, and has known, that the persons with disabilities in FDOC \ncustody have been deprived of humane conditions of confinement and have been exposed to \ngrave conditions that violate contemporary standards of decency, resulting in the denial of \n- 119 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 120 of 123\ncivilized life’s minimal necessities.  Yet Defendant has failed and intentionally refused to do \nanything that would remedy the situation.  Defendant has been deliberately indifferent to these \nconditions.   \n480.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  this  pattern,  practice,  and  deliberate \nindifference,  individuals  with  disabilities  in  FDOC  custody—Plaintiff’s  clients  and \nconstituents—have suffered, and continue to suffer from harm and violation of their Eighth \nAmendment rights.  These harms will continue unless enjoined by this Court. \nCOUNT 4 \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n481.  This  count  is  brought  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n482.  Persons with disabilities in FDOC custody have a liberty interest in gain time \n(“good time” credits).  Gain time can be taken away or not awarded as a result of being found \nguilty of a Disciplinary Report (DR).  Losing gain time or failing to award gain time affects the \nlength of a person’s incarceration; that is, losing gain time or not being awarded gain time can \ncause prisoners to spend more time in prison.  Thus, taking away gain time or failing to award it \nrequires constitutionally adequate procedures. \n483.  By failing to provide interpreters or other effective accommodations during DR \nhearings to prisoners with disabilities, Defendant has failed to provide people with disabilities in \nFDOC custody with constitutionally adequate process.   \n484.  Defendant knows, and has known, that people with disabilities are being deprived \nof their Due Process rights, yet Defendant has failed and intentionally refused to remedy the \nsituation, thereby exhibiting deliberate indifference to the violations of these rights.   \n485.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  this  pattern,  practice,  and  deliberate \n- 120 - \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-00047-WS-CAS   Document 1   Filed 01/26/16   Page 121 of 123\nindifference,  individuals  with  disabilities  in  FDOC  custody—Plaintiff’s  clients  and \nconstituents—have suffered, and continue to suffer from harm and violation of their Due Process \nrights.  These harms will continue unless enjoined by this Court. \nRELIEF SOUGHT \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief: \nA.  A declaration that Defendant has violated, and continues to violate, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Eighth Amendment, and the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; \nB.  A preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendant to cease violating \nthe  aforementioned  laws  protecting  people  with  disabilities  within  FDOC \ncustody; \nC.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  requiring  Defendant  to  implement \npolicies  and  take  actions  that  will  ensure  future  compliance  with  the \naforementioned laws;  \nD.  An order retaining jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the terms of any \ninjunction are fully implemented;  \nE.  An award of attorneys’ fees, costs, and litigation expenses under 42 U.S.C. § \n12205, 29 U.S.C. § 794a, and 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and   \nF.
