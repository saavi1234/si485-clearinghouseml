    "summary": "<p>For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic of Yale Law School filed this motion in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to unseal all of the court's orders and opinions containing \"novel or significant interpretations of law\" issued between September 11, 2001, and the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act on June 2, 2015. The ACLU argued that the First Amendment compelled release of these judicial decisions and that FISC Rule 62 gave the FISC discretion to publish its own orders, opinions, and decisions. Three years earlier (Docket Misc. 13-08), the ACLU had filed a similar motion, requesting the release of all opinions addressing the legal basis for bulk data collection under&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> FISA </a>. The litigation under Misc. 13-08 was still ongoing at the time the ACLU filed this case, but the request in this case was broader, including opinions that were unrelated to bulk data collection.</p>\r\n<p>While this motion was pending, FISC Judge Rosemary Collyer dismissed the motion in Misc. 13-08, concluding that the ACLU lacked standing. In March 2017, after a request from the ACLU to alter or amend Judge Collyer's earlier opinion, Judge Collyer called for an en banc reconsideration in Misc. 13-08 of whether the ACLU had standing. In light of the status of Misc. 13-08, on March 27, 2017, Judge Collyer issued an order in this case directing the parties to confer and discuss whether this case should be stayed.</p>\r\n<p>The parties did not agree to stay the case. Instead, on March 29, 2017, the ACLU moved to delay briefing in light of the proceedings in Misc. 13-08. The court granted this request, delaying the briefing until June 2017. On June 8, 2017, the government filed its response to the motion, making the same argument it had made in Misc. 13-08&mdash;that the ACLU lacked standing because neither the First Amendment nor FISA Rule 62 gave the ACLU a right of access to FISC opinions. On June 30, 2017, the ACLU filed a response, arguing that well-established First Amendment law provided the ACLU with a right to judicial opinions in every Article III court, except for the FISC. The ACLU thus argued that lack of access to FISC opinions was \"the one federal court in which the public is denied access to judicial interpretations of public laws, individual rights, and limitations on government power.\"</p>\r\n<p>On June 14, 2018, the ACLU filed a motion to consolidate this docket with Misc. 13-08, arguing that the legal issues between the two overlapped extensively, including questions of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2020, FISC released its opinion. Judge Collyer clarified that the movants were seeking a large amount of redacted, non-public material in opinions addressing the bulk collection of data. The court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion for the Release of Court Records but the First Amendment did not confer a qualified right of public access to the material sought, and there was no reason for the court to exercise any discretion it might have had in granting the relief requested. Thus, the Motion for the Release of Court Records was denied and the motion dismissed. Judge Collyer also denied the the motion to consolidate this docket with Misc. 13-08.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Collyer left the FISC on March 7, 2020 without issuing any final judgment on the case. The ACLU filed a motion on July 10, 2020 respectfully asking for a status report and final ruling on the case. Judge Boasberg released an order on September 15, 2020 dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction; he dismissed several cases making similar arguments for lack of jurisdiction on the same day. He analogized this case, which urged the Court to exercise jurisdiction over records release requests under a combination of FISC Rule 62 and the First Amendment implied right of access, to Misc. 13-08, which the FISC Court of Review (FISCR) had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under an interpretation of \"application\" that excluded the one that the ACLU was making in this case. He noted that the categories of information sought were extremely broad, and that the parties would need to provide a more specific request in order to disclose the information.</p>\r\n<p>On October 14, 2020, the ACLU filed a petition requesting appellate review of this case or a petition for a writ of mandamus with the FISCR, along with a request to transmit the FISC docket to the FISCR. The petition noted that the Misc. 13-08 decision meant that the FISCR did not have jurisdiction, but asked the FISCR to review the case all the same. The FISCR docketed the case as Misc. 20-02 on October 16, and released a show cause order asking the petitioners to demonstrate why the FISCR should not follow the ruling in Misc. 13-08.</p>\r\n<p>The petitioners submitted their response to the show cause order on October 20, 2020. They urged the court to use this case to clarify the ruling interpreting the word \"application\" in the FISA in Misc. 13-08, which they claimed was too narrowly defined. They argued that this narrow reading threatened the constitutional rights of those that file petitions with the FISC to release court orders and opinions, since, if this definition is upheld, there likely would be no court that would grant review of these applications. The petitioners added that the FISCR should grant ancillary jurisdiction over the petition, since it involves decisions on releasing the court's own records. The petitioner's last argument noted that the FISCR can review this case under a petition for a writ of mandamus, which allows a higher court to demand a government official to properly exercise his or her authority. The petitioners argued that, given the constitutional concerns involving a lack of appellate review, demanding a lower court to exercise jurisdiction in this case, involving a balance of government power with individual rights, would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>The government filed a response brief to the ACLU's filing on November 10, 2020. The government stressed the similarity between this case and the Misc. 13-08 case, and argued that the holding from that case should prevail here and the FISCR should decline to grant review. The government also argued that the FISCR should not certify this question of law to the Supreme Court, noting that the central issue of the case, the scope executive branch's classification power, was not novel enough to require Supreme Court intervention. It added that, since this is an adversarial case, the petitioners could seek certiorari without certifying the question of law to the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, FISCR Presiding Judge David Sentelle released a brief opinion and order siding with the government and finding that the court lacked jurisdiction over the ACLU's claims. Judge Sentelle highlighted the recency of the Misc. 13-08 opinion, and said that this case was not different enough to merit review of that opinion. He also declined to certify this question of law to the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2021, the ACLU filed a petition for writ of certiorari. On November 1, 2021, the Supreme Court denied certiorari, with Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor dissenting.</p>",

Nearly \nevery day, Article III courts around the country issue opinions concerning the statutory and \nconstitutional reach of the government's surveillance powers, including under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), under the amendments to FISA enacted in 2008, and \nunder many other surveillance authorities. All but one of those courts recognize the public's right \nto see their opinions with only those redactions necessary to safeguard compelling governmental \ninterests. \nThis Court is the sole exception-the one federal court in which the public is denied \naccess to judicial interpretations of public laws, individual rights, and limitations on government \npower. The Court's refusal to recognize a right of access to its legal opinions has become \nincreasingly significant in recent years, as the FISC's mandate has expanded from its original \nrole of hearing only targeted surveillance applications to opining on the lawfulness of entire \nprograms of surveillance. That the public continues to be denied access to this Court's \nopinions-and only this Court's opinions-is constitutionally intolerable. \nThe government can defend this state of affairs only by attempting to shift the level of \ngenerality at which courts analyze the right of access. The government does not, and could not, \ndispute that the public right of access attaches to the judicial opinions of Article III courts. \nInstead, it argues that the public right of access does not attach to this Court's opinions, \n1 \n\nregardless of the specific characteristics of the records Movant seeks. But the government's logic \nis inconsistent with the law governing access to judicial records. \nThe relevant question is not whether history and logic support access to the FISC in \ngeneral, but whether history and logic support access to particular proceedings or records. \nInsofar as the FISC sits as an Article III court analyzing the scope of executive surveillance \nauthority, there is no question that history and logic support access to the resulting opinions. \nThose sorts of Article III judicial records have always been available to the public. \nMoreover, all three branches of government have endorsed the commonsense wisdom \nthat public access to this Court's significant decisions is integral to public trust, informed debate, \nand government accountability. Congress has mandated declassification of the Court's \nsignificant opinions; the executive branch is now routinely releasing the same with appropriate \nredactions to protect necessary secrecy; and the Court itself has, on its own initiative, both \npublished certain of its important opinions and indeed written them for the very purpose of \nenriching public scrutiny, understanding, and debate. \nSituated in the long history of access to judicial opinions, proper application of the \n\"history and logic\" test under the First Amendment right of access demands that this Court's \nopinions and orders containing novel or significant interpretations of law be disclosed to the \npublic. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The ACLU has standing to assert its First Amendment right of access to \nopinions of this Court. \nThe ACLU incorporates herein the arguments presented in its briefs in In re Opinions & \nOrders oft his Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata Under the Foreign Intelligence \n2 \n\nSurveillance Act, No. Misc. 13-08 (FISC 2017) (en bane). For the reasons set forth in those \npapers, this Court has jurisdiction over the ACLU's motion. \nII.  The First Amendment right of access attaches to this Court's opinions and \norders containing novel or significant interpretations of law. \nThe government does not dispute the public's right of access to judicial opinions of \nArticle III courts, but argues that this Court's orders do not constitute \"a 'place' []or a 'process\"' \nto which a First Amendment right of access attaches. Gov. Br. at 9. The government thus appears \nto contend that the public categorically lacks a right of access to the FISC as a forum, including \nto all of the proceedings and documents filed in or produced by this Court. In so doing, the \ngovernment misapplies the right-of-access doctrine, which requires this Court to examine \nwhether the right of access extends to the specific type of records or proceedings at issue, not to \nthe forum more generally. Contrary to the government's assertions, this Court need only resolve \na narrow question in this matter: whether the public has a right of access to this Court's opinions \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law. Whether the right of access also attaches to \nother of the FISC's proceedings or records is simply not at issue here. \nA.  The First Amendment right of access is analyzed based on the particular type \nof records or proceedings at issue, not based on the forum generally. \nThe government reaches the wrong conclusion because it asks the wrong question. The \ngovernment incorrectly frames the inquiry as concerning access to the FISC as a whole, \nincluding all of its proceedings and outputs. Such a broadside approach is at odds with the case \nlaw, in which the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeals analyze the right of access to \nparticular records or proceedings by focusing on the \"type or kind\" of document or proceeding, \nnot a court or forum as a whole. \nThus, for instance, when a newspaper sought access to preliminary hearings in Puerto \nRico courts, the Supreme Court asked whether the newspaper had a right of access to that type of \n3 \n\nhearing, not to the criminal process generally. See El Vocero de P.R. v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. \n147, 150 (1993) (per curiam). The courts of appeals have proceeded in like fashion with civil \nproceedings. Courts have asked not whether civil proceedings as a whole are subject to the right \nof access but instead whether the right applies to the particular stage at issue. See, e.g., Hartford \nCourant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 93-94 (2d Cir. 2004) (assessing right of access to docket \nsheets); Rushfordv. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 846 F.2d 249, 252-53 (4th Cir. 1988) (assessing \nright of access to summary judgment papers as distinct from other aspects of a civil proceeding); \nIn re Iowa Freedom ofI nfo. Council, 124 F.2d 658, 661 (8th Cir. 1983) (assessing right of access \nspecifically to civil contempt proceedings). As the Second Circuit has summarized the case law, \n\"numerous federal and state courts have also extended the First Amendment protection provided \nby Richmond Newspapers to particular types ofjudicial documents .... \"Hartford Courant, 380 \nF .3d at 91 (emphasis added). 1 \nBy contrast, the government's categorical approach ignores the significance of particular \ndocuments and proceedings that adjudicate substantive rights, and invites end-runs around the \nright of access. For example, under the government's approach, if Congress tomorrow enacted a \n1 In an effort to demonstrate that FISC proceedings and documents are categorically exempt from \nthe right of access, the government analogizes this Court's proceedings to those occurring before \na grand jury. See Gov. Br. at 9-10. Here, however, Movant seeks access to the opinions of this \nArticle III court, not to documents like grand-jury materials that reflect an \"arms-length\" \nrelationship with the federal judiciary. In re Motions ofD  ow Jones & Co., 142 F. 3d 496, 498 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992)). Moreover, the \ncases upon which the government relies confirm that the denial of public access to materials \nancillary to grand-jury proceedings is proper only to the extent that disclosure would do harm to \ngrand-jury secrecy. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 140, 150 (3d Cir. 1997) \n(determining that the First Amendment right of access attaches to proceedings that contain \nallegations of government misconduct, but not if disclosure would '\"affect' or 'relate to' grand \njury proceedings\"); In re Motions ofD  ow Jones & Co., 142 F. 3d at 506 (remanding for \nreconsideration the Chief Judge's order refusing to make available even \"redacted papers, orders, \nand transcripts\" from grand-jury ancillary proceeding). \n4 \n\nstatute redirecting Espionage Act prosecutions to the FISC-to take advantage, for example, of \nthe FISC's familiarity with handling sensitive material-the long-recognized right of access to \nthose criminal proceedings would vanish. The government's theory rests on the fact that FISC \nproceedings are frequently closed, rather than the specific characteristics of the Court's opinions \nand orders interpreting law. \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court must analyze whether the right of access \napplies by looking to the history of access to the type or kind of document requested: the legal \nopinions of Article III courts. Under the First Amendment, it is irrelevant that the FISC, as \nopposed to another Article III court, issues the opinions. But even if the Court were to apply the \n\"history and logic\" test to FISC opinions in particular, Movant has still established that a right of \naccess attaches to this Court's opinions and orders containing novel or significant interpretations \nof law. \nB.  FISC opinions containing novel or significant interpretations of law fall \nwithin the category of judicial records that lie at the core of the right of \naccess. \nProperly framed, the answer to the question that the ACLU' s motion raises is clear: \nopinions of an Article III court that contain significant or novel interpretations of law are subject \nto the First Amendment right of access. As the ACLU's opening brief explained, judicial \nopinions are the paradigmatic judicial record to which the constitutional right of access attaches. \nSee Mov. Br. at 12-13. Like the opinions of other Article III courts, this Court's orders and \nopinions that interpret the law and Constitution in novel and significant ways \"involve[] issues \nand remedies affecting third parties or the general public.\" Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. \nv. F.T.C., 710 F.2d 1165, 1179 (6th Cir. 1983). \nThis Court and the FISCR adjudicate issues of importance to the public concerning the \nextent of the government's authority to conduct surveillance and the scope of constitutional and \n5 \n\nstatutory authorization and protection. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 736 (FISA Ct. \nRev. 2002) (considering whether FISA and the Fourth Amendment permit the government to use \nelectronic surveillance when \"its primary purpose\" is criminal prosecution); In re Directives \nPursuant to Section 105B ofF oreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 551 F.3d 1004, 1012 (FISA \nCt. Rev. 2008) (\"[A] foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant \nrequirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national \nsecurity purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States.\"). \nThe First Amendment right of access applies with special force to particular documents \nand proceedings that \"adjudicate[] substantive rights.\" Rushford, 846 F.2d at 252 (4th Cir. 1988); \nsee also Matter of Cont 'l Illinois Sec. Litig., 732 F.2d 1302, 1309 (7th Cir. 1984) (applying \npresumption of openness to a proceeding to terminate derivative claims). In the criminal context, \nthis principle has been extended to plea agreements, which are \"the most common form of \nadjudication of criminal litigation.\"  United States v. Haller, 837 F.2d 84, 87 (2d Cir. 1988); see \nalso Oregonian Pub. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Oregon, 920 F .2d 1462, 1465 (9th Cir. \n1990) (recognizing right of access to plea agreements); In re Washington Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, \n389 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"Because the taking of a guilty plea serves as a substitute for a trial, it may \nreasonably be treated in the same manner as a trial for First Amendment purposes.\"). \nThis Court's opinions and orders containing novel and significant interpretations of law \nare integral to its adjudication of the scope of government authority and individual rights. In \nanalyzing whether the right of access attaches, this Court must \"focus not on formalistic \ndescriptions of the government proceeding but on the kind of work the proceeding actually does \nand on the First Amendment principles at stake.\" N. Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N. Y. City Transit \n6 \n\nAuth., 684 F.3d 286, 299 (2d Cir. 2012). Indeed, if Congress had vested jurisdiction over the \ngovernment's FISA applications in the federal district courts as a whole, rather than establishing \na specialized Article III tribunal, there would be no question that the public had a right of access \nto opinions of broad legal consequence interpreting FISA. That would plainly be true even if, as \nis common throughout the federal courts, certain information in those opinions was classified or \notherwise secret. See, e.g., N. Y.  Times Co. v. U.S. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 806 F .3d 682, 690 (2d Cir. \n2015) (ruling that paragraphs at issue in district court ruling could be disclosed in redacted form). \nThat Congress has routed the applications to a specialized Article III court does not \nchange the analysis. Statutory sealing requirements could not possibly establish that the resulting \nsecrecy is constitutional. Were it otherwise, \"legislatures could easily avoid constitutional \nstrictures by moving an old governmental function to a new institutional location.\" N. Y. Civil \nLiberties Union v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d at 299.2 \nThat Congress in 1978 created a specialized Article III court-drawn from sitting Article \nIII judges in district courts across the country-and process in order to consider the \ngovernment's FISA applications does not remove this Court's records from the scope of the \naccess right. The Supreme Court has recognized that proceedings that \"have no historical \ncounterpart\" are nonetheless subject to the First Amendment right of access. Press-Enter. Co. v. \nSuperior Court (\"Press-Enter. II\"), 478 U.S. 1, 10 n.3 (1986). \"Because the first amendment \nmust be interpreted in the context of current values and conditions ... the lack of an historic \ntradition of open ... hearings does not bar our recognizing a right of access to such hearings.\" \nUnited States v. Chagra, 701 F.2d 354, 363 (5th Cir. 1983) (citations omitted); see also Detroit \n2 Just so, the government's argument that a tradition of access can develop only if Congress \nadopts a retroactively applicable statute mandating openness, Gov. Br. at 9, is unavailing. If a \nconstitutional right of access attaches to particular judicial records or proceedings, Congress \ncannot impinge on that right by statute. \n7 \n\nFree Press v. Ashcroft, 303 F.3d 681, 700 (6th Cir. 2002) (analyzing \"whether this inquiry \nrequires a significantly long showing that the proceedings at issue were historically open\"); \nUnited States v. Criden, 675 F.2d 550, 555 (3d Cir. 1982) (\"We do not think that historical \nanalysis is relevant in determining whether there is a first amendment right of access to pretrial \ncriminal proceedings.\"). \nMoreover, the government's argument that this Court's opinions are categorically exempt \nfrom the public right of access ignores how the FISC's role has changed over time-both by \ncongressional requirement and by executive and FISC practice. Since FISA was originally \nenacted in 1978, the Court's docket has expanded significantly to include approval and oversight \nof several surveillance programs beyond individual ex parte applications for searches, \nsurveillance, or wiretaps. See, e.g., Protect America Act of2007, Pub. L. No. 110-55, 121 Stat. \n552 (2007); FISA Amendments Act of2008 (\"FAA\"), Pub. L. No. 110-261, 122 Stat. 2436 \n(2008). In this role, the FISC frequently is called upon not only to interpret FISA, but also to \ndetermine whether applications for orders authorizing programmatic or individual surveillance \ncomport with the Constitution. This function is fundamentally identical to that performed by \nother Article III courts that have analyzed and ruled on the government's authority to conduct \nsurveillance. See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int'/ USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013); Am. Civil Liberties \nUnion v. Nat 'I Sec. Agency, 493 F.3d 644 (6th Cir. 2007); Wikimedia Found. v. Nat'/ Sec. \nAgency, 857 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2017);Klayman v. Obama, 142 F. Supp. 3d 172 (D.D.C. 2015); \nDoe v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 861 (2d Cir. 2008); In re National Security Letters, No. l:l 7-mc-980 \n(D.D.C. 2017). \nEven if Congress had imagined this Court to be immune to the First Amendment right of \naccess at its inception-which it did not do, and could not have done-this body is not a static \n8 \n\none, and recent changes to the Court's function and processes demonstrate that its significant \nopinions and orders resemble those of a standard Article III court more than ever before. \nFollowing the approach of the case law, this Court must consider the particular type of document \nat issue-judicial opinions-not FISC proceedings in their entirety. \nC.  The First Amendment right of access attaches even to judicial opinions \ncontaining classified information or issued after ex parte proceedings. \nIn an effort to shift the focus away from the judicial opinions at issue in this case, the \ngovernment mischaracterizes the ACLU's narrow motion as a sweeping one. The government \nmisconstrues the motion as seeking immediate access to all of this Court's ex parte proceedings, \nrather than to one category of its judicial output: its binding orders and opinions on issues of \nconstitutional, as well as legislative, importance. Gov. Br. at 1, 13. The fact that this precedent \noften contains information that the government deems classified does not categorically defeat \nany right of access to the Court's opinions and orders. \nIndeed, that this Court conducts many ex parte, classified proceedings does not transform \nits opinions containing significant interpretations of law into something other than core judicial \nrecords. For example, that federal magistrate judges commonly hold ex parte warrant \nproceedings does not deprive the public of a right of access to their judicial opinions interpreting \nthe Fourth Amendment. To the contrary, numerous courts-including this one and the FIS CR-\nhave published opinions regarding the constitutionality of requests for surveillance that were \nmade ex parte. See, e.g., In re Application of U.S. for an Order for Prospective Cell Site \nLocation Info. on a Certain Cellular Tel., 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 452 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (\"To date, \nat least three district and eleven magistrate judges have issued opinions addressing applications \nfor orders authorizing the disclosure of prospective cell site information pursuant to the Pen \nRegister Statute and the Stored Communications Act.\"). Indeed, that warrant applications are \n9 \n\nmade ex parte does not even deprive the public of the right of access to the affidavits submitted \nin support of warrant applications, and to the resulting warrants, after the warrants have been \nexecuted. See, e.g., Jones v. Kirchner, 835 F. 3d 74, 88 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (appending the search \nwarrant to the opinion); YoungBey v. March, 616 F. 3d 1114, 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting the \nwarrant affidavit, which is in the record). \nMoreover, that the executive branch has \"broad discretion\" to redact opinions issued by \nArticle III courts that contain classified information, Gov. Br. at 11, does not mean that it can \nunilaterally decide whether the First Amendment right attaches to a particular opinion at all. See, \ne.g., N.Y. Times Co., 806 F.3d at 690 (\"We have ... made all of the redactions requested by the \ngovernment, except those concerning the three paragraphs at issue on page 9 of the District \nCourt's opinion.\"); In re Sealed Case, 310 F .3d 717 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (redacting classified \ninformation). Nor does it mean that the Court has no role to play in reviewing that decision. See, \ne.g., Bismullah v. Gates, 501 F.3d 178, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"It is the court, not the \nGovernment, that has discretion to seal a judicial record.\"), vacated on other grounds, 554 U.S. \n913 (2008); In re Washington Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 393 (4th Cir. 1986) (even ifthe \ngovernment sought to withhold classified material from the public under the Classified \nInformation Procedures Act, \"the district court would not be excused from making the \nappropriate constitutional inquiry\" under Press-Enterprise II.). Such a suggestion belies the \nrigorous standard applicable to the sealing of court records, even those that contain classified \ninformation. Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 9, 11. Contrary to the government's assertions, the \nConstitution requires courts to make \"specific, on the record findings\" regarding the content of \nclassified records in order to determine whether \"closure is essential to preserve higher values \n10 \n\nand is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting \nPress-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court (\"Press-Enter. f'), 464 U.S. 501, 502 (1984)). \nThe government likewise errs when it suggests that this Court, in particular, has no role \nto play in reviewing executive branch classification decisions pertinent to its own decisions, \nopinions, and orders. This Court's own actions refute the government's position. See, e.g., Order, \nIn re Directives, No. 105B(g) 07-01, at 3 (July 15, 2013) (requiring the government to undertake \na declassification review). Moreover, this Court's scrutiny of executive branch classification \ndecisions plays an important public role by effectively reducing the scope and extent of \nunjustified classification. For example, in response to the ACLU's 2014 motion for access to \nFISC opinions, Judge Saylor undertook a searching review of the government's classification \ndecisions, \"examined the scope of each redaction in the First Redaction Proposal and called to \nthe government's attention each portion of redacted text as to which the Court questioned the \nbasis for, or scope of, the redaction.\" In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 of \nPatriot Act, No. MISC. 13-02, 2014 WL 5442058, at *4 (FISA Ct. Aug. 7, 2014). In response, \nthe government ultimately declassified the material in question. Id In any event, the \ngovernment's fixation on what it calls \"the FISC's unbroken history as a non-public forum\" is \nsimply inaccurate. Gov. Br. at 9. 3 \n3 The government's use of the phrase \"non-public forum\" to describe this Court is puzzling. \nForum doctrine describes \"the rights of the state to limit expressive activity\" in certain locations. \nPerry Educ. Ass 'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass 'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). It may be true, for \nexample, that federal courts are non-public forums for the purposes of expressive activity such as \nart exhibits, see Sefick v. Gardner, 164 F.3d 370, 372 (7th Cir. 1998), but that has no bearing on \nthe Movant's ability to seek access to judicial records through litigation. \n11 \n\nThat this Court consistently deals with classified information might make it an outlier \namong federal courts, but it does not make it unique.4  As the Seventh Circuit has.recognized, \n\"[e  ]ven disputes about claims of national security are litigated in the open.\" Union Oil Co. of \nCalifornia v. Leavell, 220 F .3d 562, 567 (7th Cir. 2000). Indeed, the decisions the government \ncites establish that the presence of classified information does not outweigh the strong tradition \nof issuing published judicial opinions, regardless of subject matter. See, e.g., Nat'/ Council of \nResistance ofI ran v. Dep't ofS tate, 251F.3d192, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (reviewing designation \nas a foreign terrorist organization); Holy Land Found for Relief&   Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F .3d \n156 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (reviewing designation as foreign terrorist organization and blocking of \nassets); Bismullah v. Gates, 501 F.3d 178 (reviewing designation as enemy combatant); Dhiab v. \nTrump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Op. of Randolph, J.) (reviewing order compelling \ndisclosure of court records to the media). \nThe government's framing is also erroneous because it suggests that the right of access to \njudicial opinions and orders attaches only if the public has an unfettered, contemporaneous right \nof access to the underlying proceedings. This suggestion has two flaws. First, it conflates the \nquestion of whether the right attaches with whether it is overcome. In other words, the right of \naccess is a qualified right that may be overcome by a compelling showing, but the fact that \naccess may be overcome in specific circumstances does not defeat access in a global sense. \nSecond, the government's argument ignores that denials of access must be narrowly tailored in \nduration: information that may be redacted today must nevertheless be released once the interest \n4 Indeed, while sitting in their regular district courts rather than \"in\" the FISC, the judges of this \nCourt regularly encounter classified information. See, e.g., ACLU v. CIA, 109 F. Supp. 3d 200 \n(D.D.C. 2015) (Collyer, J.); Opinion & Order, United States v. Khan, No. 12-cr-659 (D. Or. Nov. \n24, 2014), ECF No. 157 (Mosman, J.); ACLU v. CIA, 808 F. Supp. 2d 280 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(Collyer, J.). \n12 \n\njustifying secrecy dissipates. See, e.g., Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 393 (1979) \n(\"Once the danger of prejudice had dissipated, a transcript of the suppression hearing was made \navailable.\"); Phx. Newspapers, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court/or Dist. ofA riz., 156 F.3d 940, 947 (9th \nCir. 1998) (\"[T]ranscripts of public trial proceedings must be released when the factors militating \nin favor of closure no longer exist.\"); United States v. Edwards, 823 F.2d 111, 119 (5th Cir. \n1987) (instructing courts to \"avoid unnecessary delay in releasing the record of closed \nproceedings after trial\"). The government's recent decisions to declassify some of the records \nsought here and produce them under FOIA demonstrate that the public need not have access to \nthis Court's ex parte proceedings in order to benefit from the release of its opinions. Indeed, the \nfact that courts sometimes issue redacted opinions, or accompany public opinions with classified \nones, simply demonstrates that courts can appropriately handle classified information while \nensuring that closure is narrowly tailored under the First Amendment. \nNor does the possible availability of a remedy under FOIA, as the government suggests, \nsee Gov. Br. at 15-16, displace the constitutional right of access to this Court's opinions and \norders that demands more rigorous scrutiny. FOIA's requirement that the executive branch \nproduce all \"reasonably segregable\" non-exempt material is less demanding than the First \nAmendment's requirement that closure is \"narrowly tailored\" to serve a \"overriding\" \ngovernment interest. Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at 510. More fundamentally, when FOIA \nrequesters seek access to FISC orders and opinions as \"agency records\" under FOIA, the Court \nlacks any opportunity to itself consider whether the opinions should be published, or to direct the \nExecutive Branch to undertake a declassification review. Instead, FOIA cases are adjudicated by \ndistrict court judges who simply do not have the ability to examine the government's claims with \nthe same familiarity that the FISC itself can apply to its own opinions. \n13 \n\nThe limited set of this Court's opinions at issue in this matter fit squarely within the long \ntradition of public access to significant legal opinions. Indeed, that courts take pains to publish \nopinions on significant legal matters even when the underlying proceedings involve classified \ninformation or occur ex parte further underscores the strength of that tradition of access. For that \nreason, this Court should reject the government's insinuation that the ACLU is attempting to slip \nthrough the Court's back door to gain access to its ex parte proceedings. That issue is simply not \nbefore the Court. \nD.  Access to FISC opinions has a positive effect on FISC proceedings and on public \nunderstanding of the government's surveillance authorities. \nPublic access to judicial opinions of Article III courts-the outcomes of the adjudicative \nprocess-is integral both to public participation in the justice system and to the development of \njudicial decisionmaking and a body of caselaw. Access to this Court's opinions and orders \ncontaining novel or significant legal interpretations is equally essential to development of the law \nas it is to democratic oversight. Mov. Br. at 16-20. \"Without access to judicial opinions, public \noversight of the courts, including the processes and the outcomes they produce, would be \nimpossible.\" Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 267 (4th Cir. 2014). \nAll three branches of government have now recognized the \"logic\" of transparency when \nit comes to FISC opinions, and the positive effects that transparency has had on this Court's \nproceedings and on the public's understanding ofFISA. Congress embraced the importance of \ntransparency when it enacted the USA FREEDOM Act, requiring that the government \"make \npublicly available to the greatest extent practicable\" each FISC order or opinion issued after June \n2, 2015 that contains a significant or novel interpretation of the law. USA FREEDOM Act § 402, \n50 U.S.C. § 1872 (2016). This provision reflects Congress's confidence that such opinions ought \nto be available for public inspection. Id. see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee (requiring the Privacy and \n14 \n\nCivil Liberties Oversight Board to issue public reports and hold public hearings to the extent \npossible). Pursuant to this statutory requirement, in 2016, the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") released a FISCR opinion that contained a significant interpretation of the \nlaw regarding the acquisition of post cut-through digits pursuant to Section 402. In re Certified \nQuestion ofL aw, No. 16-01 (FISA Ct. Rev. Apr. 14, 2016); see also In re [Redacted], a U.S. \nPerson, PR/TT No. 15-52 (FISA Ct. Jun. 18, 2015) (Boasberg, J.); Mem. Op. (FISA Ct. Nov. 6, \n2015) (Hogan, J.); Mem. Op. (FISA Ct. Dec. 31, 2015) (Hogan, J.); Mem. Op. (FISA Ct. Apr. \n26, 2017) (Collyer, J.); In re Application oft he Federal Bureau ofI nvestigation for an Order \nRequiring the Production ofT angible Things, BR No. 15-99 (FISA Ct. Nov. 24, 2015) (Mosman, \nJ.). \nThe executive branch has likewise recognized that transparency is integral to \"the \nappearance of fairness.\" Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 9. The government has made available \nsubstantial additional material concerning this Court's proceedings and records in response to \nrecent FOIA requests. For example, in recent weeks, the government has made available \ntranscripts of two ex parte, classified FISC hearings, as well as an amicus curiae brief, and \nnumerous other FISC filings. See ODNI, Additional Release ofF ISA Section 702 Documents, IC \non the Record (June 14, 2017), http://bit.ly/2tqkMPF. The government has also declassified and \nreleased portions of eighteen FISC opinions to the Electronic Frontier Foundation pursuant to a \nstipulation reached in FOIA litigation. See Stipulation and [Proposed] Order, EFF v. Dep 't of \nJustice, No. 16-cv-2041 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2016), ECF No. 39. \nMore generally, the executive branch has recognized the strong public interest in \ntransparency regarding the government's use ofFISA orders. In 2013, Bob Litt testified before \nCongress that \"it's important to help the public understand how the intelligence community uses \n15 \n\nthe legal authorities that Congress has provided it to gather foreign intelligence, and the vigorous \noversight of those activities to ensure that they comply with the law.\" See Surveillance \nTransparency Act of2 013: Hearing on S. 1621 Before the Subcomm. on Privacy, Tech. & the \nLaw oft he S. Comm. on the Judiciary, l 13th Cong. 5 (2013) (statement of Robert Litt, General \nCounsel, ODNI, and J. Bradford Wiegmann, Deputy Assistant Attorney General). To that end, in \n2014, ODNI began publishing an annual transparency report. ODNI, Statistical Transparency \nReport (2016), available at http://bit.ly/2pkcxjq. In 2015, ODNI adopted the \"Principles of \nIntelligence Transparency Implementation Plan\" to \"enhance[] public understanding of \nintelligence activities.\" ODNI, Principles ofI ntelligence Transparency Implementation Plan 1 \n(2015), available at http://bit.ly/2s5lbD3. \nIndeed, this Court and the FISCR have also recognized the value of public participation \nand representation in their proceedings. As a result, they have taken actions that have \nsubstantially increased the public's ability to understand the Court's proceedings by, for \nexample, accepting amicus participation and publishing opinions. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, \n310 F .3d 717, 719 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (accepting amicus participation). Since 2013, this Court \nhas taken further steps to increase the transparency of its proceedings and documents by \nmaintaining a public docket of unclassified filings. See Public Filings, U.S. Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings (listing public filings \n\"[b] eginning June 2013 \"). FISC judges have also ordered the government to conduct \ndeclassification reviews of the Court's opinions. See, e.g., Order, In re Directives, No. 105B(g) \n07-01, at 3 (July 15, 2013) (Walton, J.); Jn re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 of \nPatriot Act, 2014 WL 5442058, at *1 (Saylor, J.). \n16 \n\nMoreover, in numerous decisions, this Court and the FISCR have also recognized that the \npublic interest in the substance of the Court's decisions weighs in favor of publication. For \nexample, in September 2013, Judge Saylor recognized both that \"movants and amici have \npresented several substantial reasons why the public interest might be served\" by publishing the \nCourt's opinions regarding Section 215. /n re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Sec. 215 oft he \nPatriot Act, No. MISC. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7 (FISA Ct. Sept. 13, 2013) (finding that \nopenness \"would contribute to an informed debate\" regarding Section 215); see also In re \nDirectives, 551 F .3d at 1016 (publishing opinion); In re Application ofF .B.I. for an Order \nRequiring Prod. o/Tangible Things from Redacted, No. BR 13-109, 2013 WL 5741573, at *10 \n(FISA Ct. Aug. 29, 2013) (Eagan, J.) (requesting, sua sponte, publication under Rule 62(a) \n\"[b ]ecause of the public interest in this matter\"). \nAll of this recent history reflects a conviction by all three branches of government that \npublic oversight and understanding of the FISC's activities are essential. \nThe government counters that recognizing a right of access to this Court's significant \nlegal opinions would \"incentivize government officials to conduct surveillance without FISC \napproval where the need for such approval is unclear.\"  Gov. Br. at 14. As an initial matter, given \nthe executive branch's commitment to transparency, it is odd that the government claims that \npublic review would \"chill\" its interactions with the Court. In support of this assertion, the \ngovernment relies heavily on Judge Bates's 2007 In re Motion opinion. Jn re Motion/or Release \no/Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 492 (FISA Ct. 2007). Since 2007, however, as detailed \nabove, Congress, the executive branch, and this Court have all recognized the increased \nimportance of transparency and accountability for the Court's opinions, decisions, and orders, as \nwell as court filings. In so doing, the government, Congress, and this Court have undermined \n17 \n\nJudge Bates' s speculation about the negative consequences that would flow from greater \ntransparency. Moreover, the government's suggestion that the public servants bound by this \nCourt's rulings would flout its constitutional commands is both an affront to the Court's \nauthority and takes an unjustifiably dim view of government employees themselves. This Court \nshould therefore reject the government's suggestion that facilitating access to the Court's \nopinions, as Congress has already required in Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, would \n\"incentivize\" it to conduct warrantless surveillance or be less than candid before the Court. Br. at \n14. For the same reasons, this Court should likewise reject the government's contention that \nrecognizing a right of access to the opinions would pose an unacceptable risk to security. History \nhas shown that the courts are competent to publish what should be made public and to keep \nsecret what should not. \nIII.  This Court can consider publishing its own opinions pursuant to FISC Rule 62. \nThe government cites no authority suggesting that this Court cannot consider the ACLU's \nrequest that it exercise discretion under Rule 62 to publish its own opinions. This Court can \nundoubtedly decide, pursuant to Rule 62, to initiate the process of publishing the opinions to \nwhich the ACLU has sought access. This Court should not and need not be blind to the public \ninterest in determining whether to pursue publication of its own opinions. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movant respectfully requests that this Court release its \nopinions containing novel or significant interpretations of law, with only those limited redactions \nthat satisfy the strict test to overcome the constitutional right of access. \n18 \n\nDated: June 29, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Hannah Bloch-Wehba \nPatrick Toomey  David A.

See In re Opinions & Orders by the FISC Addressing Bulk \nCollection ofD  ata under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 957 F.3d 1344 \n(FISA Ct. Rev. 2020) (\"In re Opinions & Orders\").  As in In re Opinions & \nOrders, petitioner here \"filed a motion in a new 'miscellaneous' case seeking the \ndisclosure of non-public material which has been deemed classified by the \nExecutive Branch and to which [petitioner has] not established a factual \nconnection.\"  I d.  at 1357 (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).  And as in that \nearlier case, petitioner asks this Court to \"expand [its] jurisdiction in a way that is \ncontrary to so many statutory provisions that limit [its] jurisdiction to a specialized \narea of national concern, -that is, the governmental electronic surveillance of \ncommunications for foreign intelligence purposes.\"  !d. at 1358 (footnote and \nquotation marks omitted).  Petitioner cannot distinguish this precedent; indeed, \npetitioner does not even attempt to.  The petition should therefore be dismissed. \nThis Court should also decline petitioner's request to certify a question of \nlaw to the Supreme Court in this case.  The Supreme Court has admonished that \nappellate courts have a duty to decide issues whenever possible, rather than \n1 \n..J \n.J \n\ncertifying them to the Supreme Court.  Moreover, this case is adversarial, and \npetitioner can petition the Supreme Court for review if it chooses.  And this case \ndoes not, in any event, raise an issue worthy of Supreme Court review. \nBACKGROUND \nIn 2016, petitioner filed this miscellaneous action (Misc. No. 16-01) in the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") requesting \"opinions and orders \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law issued between September 11, \n2001 and ... June 2, 2015.\"  Mot. for Release of Court Records 1 (filed Oct. 19, \n20 16).  Recognizing that these records contain a substantial amount of classified \ninformation, petitioner asked the FISC to take over the task of making \ndeclassification decisions, and to do so using a strict-scrutiny standard.  See id. \nat 21-24. \nThat same year, a different public interest organization filed a similar case in \ndistrict court.  See Electronic Frontier Found. v. U.S. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 376 F. \nSupp. 3d 1023 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  There, the plaintiff requested \"all decisions, \norders, or opinions issued by [the] FISC or FISCR between 1978 and June 1, 2015, \nthat include a significant construction or interpretation of any law, including a \nsignificant construction of a 'specific selection term' under the USA FREEDOM \n2 \n\nAct.\"  !d. at 1026.  In response, the government released 73 FISC opinions in \nwhole or in part and withheld 6 opinions that were classified in full.  !d. \nThe government has maintained, in this case and others, that these types of \nrecord-request cases may be litigated in district court, as occurred in Electronic \nFrontier Foundation, but fall outside the jurisdiction of the FISC and this Court. \nFollowing this Court's decision in In re Opinions & Orders, the FISC agreed and \ndismissed this case.  See In re Opinions & Orders of This Court Containing Novel \nor Significant Interpretations ofL  aw, 2020 WL 5637419 (FISA Ct. Sept. 15, \n2020).  The FISC held that it was \"not empowered by Congress to consider \nconstitutional claims generally, First Amendment claims specifically, or \nfreestanding motions filed by persons who are not authorized by FISA to invoke \nthis Court's jurisdiction.\"  !d. at *2. \nARGUMENT \n1.  While petitioner asks this Court to \"clarify or revisit its prior ruling,\" \nResp. to Order to Show Cause 2, petitioner merely regurgitates meritless \narguments that this Court has already rejected.  Petitioner argues that 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1803 (b) 1 provides this Court with jurisdiction over this records-request case. \n1 Section 1803(b) provides that this Court \"shall have jurisdiction to review \nthe denial of any application made under this chapter.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1803(b ). \n3 \n.. \n.J \n\nI. \nThis Court has already held that this is wrong \"for at least four reasons,\" and that \npetitioner's argument would lead to \"at least three untenable consequences.\"  In re \nOpinions & Orders, 957 F.3d at 1352, 1354.  Petitioner next cites the collateral \norder doctrine and the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction, but this case is not \ncollateral or ancillary to anything.  See id. at 1355-57.  It is an independent action \nthat requires its own basis for jurisdiction, and there is none.  See id.  In short, this \ncase \"falls outside the class of cases that Congress carefully identified as being \nsubject\" to this Court's jurisdiction.  I d.  at 1358. \nPetitioner contends that there is a constitutional concern with a finding of no \njurisdiction, but that is precisely backwards.  The relevant constitutional principle \nis \"the well-settled principle that Congress has the exclusive authority to invest all \ncourts inferior to the Supreme Court 'with jurisdiction in the exact degrees and \ncharacter which to Congress may seem proper for the public good.\"'  !d. at 1349. \n(quoting Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 698 (1992)); accord Kokkonen v. \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. ofA  m. . , 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (\"It is to be presumed that \na cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the \ncontrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.\" (citation omitted)).  It is \npetitioner who asks this Court to ignore a well-settled constitutional rule and to \n4 \nj \n\nassert jurisdiction that Congress has not granted to it.  This Court has declined \nsuch an invitation before, and it should do so again. \n2.  Unable to distinguish this Court's precedent, petitioner next asks this \nCourt to certify a question of law to the Supreme Court pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1803(k) and 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2).2  But petitioner \"presents no basis for this \ncourt to 'invok[ e] so exceptional a jurisdiction of [the Supreme] Court as that on \ncertification.\"'  Simon v. Bickell, 2011 WL 1770138, at *1  (D.C. Cir. Apr. 22, \n2011) (quoting Wisniewski v. United States, 353 U.S. 901, 902 (1957) (per \ncuriam)).  The Supreme Court has stressed that it is \"the task of a Court of Appeals \nto decide all properly presented cases coming before it, except in the rare instances, \nas for example the pendency of another case before this Court raising the same \nissue, when certification may be advisable in the proper administration and \nexpedition of judicial business.\"  Wisniewski, 353 U.S. at 902; accord In re Hill, \n777 F.3d 1214, 1225 (11th Cir. 2015) (\"The Supreme Court has discouraged the \nuse of [the Section 1254(2)] certification procedure\" and \"admonished\" that it \"is \n2  Section 1803 (k) provides that this Court is a \"court of appeals\" for \npurposes of28 U.S.C. § 1254(2).  Section 1254(2) provides that \"[b]y certification \nat any time by a court of appeals of any question of law in any civil or criminal \ncase as to which instructions are desired, and upon such certification the Supreme \nCourt may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for \ndecision of the entire matter in controversy.\"  28 U.S.C. § 1254(2). \n5 \n.... \n\nproper only in 'rare instances.\"').  Because this Court is capable of addressing the \njurisdictional issue before it-indeed it already has-certification to the Supreme \nCourt would be inappropriate.  Wisniewski, 353 U.S. at 902; see also United States \nv. Seale, 558 U.S. 985 (2009) (dismissing question certified pursuant to Section \n1254(2)); United States v. Penaranda, 543 U.S. 1117 (2005) (same); In re Slagle, \n504 U.S. 952 (1992) (same) (citing Wisniewski).  Moreover, because this matter is \nadversarial, petitioner is capable of seeking Supreme Court review on its own, \nwhich is another reason why certification is inappropriate.  See Taylor v. Atlantic \nMaritime Co., 181 F.2d 84, 85 (2d Cir. 1950) (rejecting a request for certification \nbecause there is \"no reason for imposing an appeal upon the Supreme Court, which \nit does not choose to take of its own motion, except in cases when no petition for \ncertiorari is available to the aggrieved party\"). \nThis case, in any event, does not raise an issue that would merit Supreme \nCourt review.  The issue that it presents-whether the FISC and this Court have \njurisdiction over cases seeking FISC records that are non-public due to Executive \nBranch classification decisions-is not a sufficiently important question of law for \nSupreme Court adjudication.  Petitioner places importance on this question only \nbecause it would like the FISC to usurp the Executive Branch's declassification \nfunction.  But that effort is contrary to well-established law.  See, e.g., Dep 't of the \n6 \n\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527-30 (1988); CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 179-80 \n(1985); see also In re Opinions & Orders, 957 F.3d at 1357 (explaining that \"the \ncrux of the Movants' claim to disclosure here lies within the Executive's clear \nauthority to determine what material should remain classified\"); In re Certification \nof Questions ofL  aw to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ofR  eview, \n2018 WL 2709456, at *1  (FISA Ct. Rev. Mar. 16, 2018) (observing that courts are \n\"not well equipped to make the sometimes difficult determinations as to whether \n' \nportions of [court] orders may be released without posing a risk to national security \nor compromising ongoing investigations\").  Indeed, when the FISC mistakenly \nbelieved that it had jurisdiction over this type of case, it persuasively and \nrepeatedly rejected petitioner's claim on the merits.  See, e.g., In re Opinions & \nOrders of This Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, 2020 WL 897659, at *7-16 (FISA Ct. Feb. 11, \n2020), appeal dismissed, 957 F.3d 1344 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2020); In reMotion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 490-97 (FISA Ct. 2007).  Given \nthat the underlying legal claim is clearly without merit, the jurisdictional question \nlacks sufficient importance to justify Supreme Court review. \n7 \n.J \n\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should deny the petition for review for want of jurisdiction, and \nthis Court should also deny petitioner's request to certify a question of law to the \nSupreme Court pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1803(k) and 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2). \nRespectfully submitted, \nJOHN C.

In re Opinions & Orders by the FISC Addressing Bulk \nCollection ofD  ata Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 957 F.3d 1344 (FISA Ct. \nRev. 2020) (In re Opinions & Orders by the FISC on Bulk Collection).  Following our decision \nin that case, the FISC, considering a separate motion that sought disclosure of other FISC \nclassified opinions and orders but likewise was based on a First Amendment right of access \nclaim, dismissed the motion after applying our reasoning in In re Opinions & Orders by the \nFISC on Bulk Collection.  See In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Containing Novel or \nSignificant Interpretations ofL aw, FISC Docket No. Misc. 16-0 I (FISA Ct. Sept. 15, 2020), \navailable at https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings/opinion-and-order-8.  This appeal \nfollowed. \n\nMovant American Civil Liberties Union filed with this Court a Petition for Review \nseeking to appeal the FISC's September 2020 dismissal decision or, in the alternative, a Petition \nfor a Writ of Mandamus (Petition).  In its accompanying Notice of Appeal, the Movant, citing to \nin re Opinions & Orders by the FISC on Bulk Collection, \"recognize[ d) that this Court has \npreviously determined that it does not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal or petition for a \nwrit of mandamus filed by a movant claiming a First Amendment right of public access to the \nFiSC's legal opinions.\"  Movant Notice of Appeal, filed Oct. 14, 2020. \nOn October 16, 2020, we ordered the Movant to file a brief and show cause as to why this \nCourt has the authority to entertain the Movant's Petition.  The Government also was provided \nthe opportunity to file a response, and both Parties timely filed their briefs. \nThe Movant now asks this Court to \"clarify or revisit\" its earlier ruling in In re Opinions \n& Orders by the FISC on Bulk Collection, or in the alternative, to certify jurisdictional questions \nraised by the Movant's Petition to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Movant Brief at 2. \nThe Movant acknowledges that its position relies, among other things, on an interpretation of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was rejected by this Court just over six months ago in \nIn re Opinions & Orders by the FISC on Bulk Collection.  !d. at 3.  The Government counters \nthat our decision in that case controls disposition of the Movant's Petition, and the Petition \ntherefore should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \nAfter careful consideration of the Parties' briefs, we decline the Movant's invitation to \nrevisit our recent decision.  We conclude that In re Opinions & Orders by the FISC on Bulk \nCollection applies to our consideration of the Movant's Petition, and we are unpersuaded that the \nMovant has shown cause as to why this Court has jurisdiction to consider its current claims.  In \n2 \n\nlight of that conclusion, this case does not present a question of law as to which instructions from \nthe Supreme Court are desired.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(k); 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2). \nThe September 15, 2020 decision of the FISC is AFFIRMED, and the Movant's Petition \nis DISMISSED. \nSo ORDERED this ~day of November, 2020. \nDav-d8.

As this Court made clear in multiple opinions from 2007 to 2017, there is no First \nAmendment public right of access to \"proceedings that relate to applications made by the \nExecutive Branch for the issuance of court orders approving authorities covered exclusively by\" \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\").  In re Opinions & Orders oft his Court \nAddressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 2017 WL \n* \n427591, at  19 (FISA Ct. Jan. 25, 2017).  The American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\") has \nrepeatedly resisted this holding, and does so again here.  The ACLU's argument should be \nrejected again by this Court. \nBACKGROUND \nThis Court was established by Congress in 1978 and vested with jurisdiction to rule on \ncertain government requests for authority to collect foreign intelligence pursuant to FISA.  After \nthis Court had been operating for nearly thirty years, beginning in 2007, the ACLU has \nrepeatedly sought to acquire broad public access to this Court's proceedings and rulings by \nrepeatedly asserting the same argument. \n\nA.  The ACLU's First Motion \nIn August 2007, the ACLU, through a motion to this court, asserted for the first time that \nthe public had a First Amendment right of access to this Court's proceedings and rulings.  See In \nre Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 485 (FISA Ct. 2007) (Bates, J.) \n(\"Motion for Release I\").  At that time, the FISC had been operating for 29 years and had issued \nthousands of classified, non-public rulings and only two publicly available opinions.  Id. at 492. \nNevertheless, the ACLU argued that the FISC had a constitutional obligation to make public \ncertain orders issued in January 2007 as well as related materials.  Id. at 485 & n.2. \nIn an exhaustively reasoned, published opinion, this Court rejected the contention that \nthere is a First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings and rulings, including rulings \nthat\"' include legal analysis and legal rulings concerning the meaning of FISA.\"' Id. at 493 \n(quoting brief of ACLU).  The Court applied the test set forth by the Supreme Court in Press \nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986) (\"Press-Enterprise If'), for determining \nwhether a First Amendment right of access attaches to a particular judicial place and process. \nMotion for Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 492.  The Court observed that the right of access only \napplies where both the \"'experience and logic' tests\" are satisfied.  Id. \nThe Court first addressed the experience test, which asks \"'whether the place and process \nhave historically been open to the press and general public.\"' Id. (quoting Press-Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 8).  The Court observed that neither the \"place\" - the FISC - nor the \"process\" -\nsurveillance proceedings under FISA- have historically been open to the public. Id. at 492-93. \nThus, the Court held that \"the ACLU's First Amendment claim runs counter to a long \nestablished and virtually unbroken practice of excluding the public from FISA applications and \norders.\" Id at 493. \n2 \n\nBecause the ACLU's claim failed to meet the \"experience\" test, its argument for access \nfailed \"regardless of whether it passe[d] the 'logic' test.\"  Id.  The Court nevertheless addressed \nthat test and found an additional basis on which to reject the ACLU's First Amendment claim. \nSee id. at 493-97.  The Court observed that, as with \"any type of [judicial] proceeding,\" some \nbenefit could be expected from public access to foreign intelligence authority proceedings. Id. at \n494.  But the Court observed that a number of \"detrimental consequences\" that would follow \nfrom public access to FISC proceedings \"would greatly outweigh any such benefits.\" Id.  The \nCourt found that harms to national security, such as assisting adversaries in avoiding \nsurveillance, seriously harming those targeted by surveillance, chilling cooperation, and \ndamaging relations with foreign governments, \"are real and significant, and, quite frankly, \nbeyond debate.\" Id.  The Court further found that applying the ACLU's proposed strict scrutiny \nstandard of independent review of Executive Branch classification decisions could lead to errors \nthat would damage national security.  Id. at 495. It would also \"chill the government's \ninteractions with the court,\" create an incentive to avoid judicial review where the legal need for \nFISC approval is unclear, and threaten \"the free flow of information to the FISC that is needed \nfor an ex parte proceeding to result in sound decisionmaking and effective oversight.\" Id. at 496. \nB.  The ACLU's Second Motion \nIn December 2007, the ACLU presented its First Amendment access argument to the \nCourt a second time in a \"Motion for Reconsideration or Reconsideration En Banc.\" See \nMemorandum Opinion, In re Motion for Release of Court Records, Misc. 07-01, at 2 (FISA Ct. \nFeb. 8, 2008) (\"Motion for Release If').  Two months later, the Court once again rejected the \nACLU's First Amendment argument.  In a footnote agreed to by all of the judges of the Court, \nthe Court held that \"the decision in this matter simply does not warrant reconsideration en bane.\" \n3 \n\nId. at 2 n.2.  In the remainder of the opinion, the Court, through Judge Bates, rejected the \narguments for reconsideration. \nWith regard to the \"experience\" test, the ACLU argued that \"the appropriate inquiry is \nwhether there is a tradition of public access to decisions of Article III courts.\" Id. at 6.  The \nCourt found this to be \"an incorrect framing of the question,\" given that \"Press-Enterprise JI \nrequires that the tests of experience and logic be applied to the 'particular proceeding in \nquestion.\"' Id. at 6 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9) (emphasis in original). The \nCourt similarly rejected the ACLU's fallback suggestion \"that the amorphous and ill-defined \ncategory of 'decisions of broad legal significance' constitutes the proper frame of reference \nunder Press-Enterprise II.\" Motion for Release JI, at 6 n.9 (quoting brief of ACLU).  The Court \nagain found that the \"experience\" test was not satisfied.  Id. at 6. \nWith regard to the \"logic\" test, the Court reiterated its earlier finding that the non \ndeferential judicial review of executive classification decisions that the ACLU sought \"would \nresult in harmful consequences that outweigh any likely public benefits.\" Id. at 7.  The Court \nfurther observed that the ACLU had not even addressed at least two of the Court's concerns \nregarding harms that would result from acceptance of the ACLU's arguments. Id. at 9. \nC.  The ACLU's Third Motion \nIn July 2008, the ACLU filed a motion to access classified FISC filings and to participate \nin FISC proceedings, which advanced its First Amendment access argument for a third time. See \nJn re Proceedings Required by§ 702(i) oft he FISA Amendments Act of2 008, 2008 WL 9487946 \n(FISA Ct. Aug. 27, 2008) (McLaughlin, J.) (\"Jn re Proceedings\").  The Court once again \nrejected the ACLU's argument, \"find[ing] no reason to reach a different conclusion\" than the one \nreached in Motion for Release I and Motion for Release II.  2008 WL 9487946, at *3.  The Court \n4 \n\nfound that \"the 'experience' test is not satisfied because neither the 'place' nor the 'process' has \n'historically been open to the press and general public.\"' Id. (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 \nU.S. at 8).  The Court found that the 'logic' test was not satisfied because any benefits to public \naccess \"would be outweighed by the risks to national security.\" Id. at *4. \nD.  The ACLU's Fourth Motion \nIn June 2013, the ACLU advanced its First Amendment argument for the fourth time. \nSee In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he Patriot Act, 2014 WL 5442058 \n(FISA Ct. Aug. 7, 2014) (Saylor, J.) (\"In re Orders\").  This time, the Court found it unnecessary \nto rule on the argument, but it nevertheless observed that \"[t]here is substantial reason to doubt \nwhether the Court, in a case in which it was necessary to reach the issue, would find that the \npublic has a qualified right of access to FISC opinions under the First Amendment.\" Id. at *4 \nn. l 0 (citing Motion for Release I and Jn re Proceedings). \nE.  The ACLU's Fifth Motion \nIn November 2013, the ACLU, joined by two co-movants, advanced, for the fifth time, \n\"in essence, the same type of legal claim,\" namely, \"that the First Amendment guarantees a \nqualified right of public access\" to FISC proceedings and rulings.  In re Opinions & Orders of \nthis Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \n2017 WL 427591, at *5-6 (FISA Ct. Jan. 25, 2017) (Collyer, P.J.) (\"In re Opinions I\"). The \nCourt noted that it had decided this issue as long ago as 2007. Id. at * 17-19 (summarizing \nMotion for Release 1).  The Court found that the ACLU's two arguments for disregarding or \nreconsidering the Court's previous decisions were unavailing.  Id. at* 19-21. \nThe Court observed that the ACLU's objection to the Court's earlier application of the \n\"experience\" test was \"premised on a misreading of the Court's analysis and an overly broad \n5 \n\nframing of the legal question.\" Id. at *19.  The Court held that the correct framing of the \n\"experience\" test was whether \"proceedings that relate to applications made by the Executive \nBranch for the issuance of court orders approving authorities covered exclusively by FISA\" have \n\"historically been open to the press and general public.\" Id.  The Court found that they have not. \nId. (finding that the record \"reflected a tradition of no public access\"). \nWith regard to the \"logic\" test, the Court found that the ACLU and the other movants had \nfailed \"to explain why they believe [the Court's earlier] conclusion was flawed\" and had failed to \n\"refute the Court's identification of the detrimental effects that could cause a diminished flow of \ninformation as a result of public access.\" Id. at *20 (citing Motion for Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d \nat 494-96).  The Court noted that the ACLU and the other movants offered only \"a generalized \nassertion that they disagree with\" the Court.  Id.  Noting that disagreement, the Court held that its \nprior analysis \"retains its force and relevance.\"  Id. at *21. \nGiven that there is no First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings, the Court \nheld that the ACLU and its co-movants \"have no legally protected interest and cannot show that \nthey suffered an injury in fact for the purpose of meeting their burden to establish standing under \nArticle III,\" and the Court thus lacked jurisdiction over their motion.  Id.  The Court further \nobserved that \"public access to opinions arising from classified, ex parte FISC proceedings is \nbest committed to the political process,\" as evidenced by the USA FREEDOM Act amendment \nto FISA providing that the executive branch, rather than the Court, should conduct \ndeclassification reviews of certain FISC opinions in order to '\"make publicly available to the \ngreatest extent practicable each such decision, order, or opinion.\"' Id. at *22 (quoting 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1872(a)). \n6 \n\nF.  The ACLU's Latest Motion \nIn October 2016, the ACLU filed the instant motion, advancing its First Amendment \nright of access argument for the sixth time.1 In this motion, the ACLU seeks an \"amorphous\" \ncategory ofrecords, Motion for Release II, at 6 n.9, namely, \"opinions and orders containing \nnovel or significant interpretations of law issued between September 11, 2001 and ... June 2, \n2015.\"  Motion 1. \nARGUMENT \nThis Court lacks jurisdiction over the ACLU's latest motion because the ACLU cannot \nestablish Article III standing.  While the ACLU asserts standing on the basis that \"denial of \naccess to court opinions\" is a \"concrete and particularized\" injury, Motion 9, this alleged injury \nis insufficient because it is not an injury to a '\"legally protected interest.\"' Jn re Opinions I, \n2017 WL 427591, at *7-15 (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (1997)).2  As this Court \nhas repeatedly held, there is no First Amendment or other legal right of access to FISC \nproceedings.  The ACLU's motion is thus without merit and should be dismissed or denied. \n1 Notably, the title of this motion, \"Motion of the American Civil Liberties Union for the \nRelease of Court Records,\" is identical to the title of the motion the ACLU filed in 2007, except \nfor the addition of\"the,\" see Motion for Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 485, and is materially \nsimilar to the titles of the motions filed in 2013, see Jn re Opinions I, 2017 WL 427591, at *1. \n2 The jurisdictional holding in In re Opinions I is currently being reviewed by the en bane \nCourt, but the holding that there is no First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings and \nrulings is not.  Thus, however the en bane Court rules in that case, the motion in this case should \nbe denied.  The only question is whether it should be denied for lack ofj urisdiction or for lack of \nlegal merit. \n7 \n\nI.  There Is No First Amendment Right of Access to FISC Proceedings \nAssuming that the First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings applies \noutside the criminal context, it attaches only to proceedings that satisfy both the '\"experience\"' \nand \"'logic'\" tests set forth by the Supreme Court.  See id. at *17 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 8).  The FISC's unique and sensitive national security proceedings do not satisfy \neither test.  Thus, for two independent reasons, the First Amendment right of access does not \napply to the FISC. \nA.  The Experience Test \nThe experience test asks \"whether the place and process have historically been open to \nthe press and general public.\" Press-Enterprise II, 4 78 U.S. at 8.  There is, of course, no \ntradition or history of public access to either the place - the FISC - or the process - \"proceedings \nthat relate to applications made by the Executive Branch for the issuance of court orders \napproving authorities covered exclusively by FISA.\"  In re Opinions I, 2017 WL 427591, at *19; \nsee also Motion/or Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 493 (observing that \"the FISC is not a court \nwhose place or process has historically been open to the public\"). \nThe ACLU argues that Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a), \nsupports its claim, but as this Court has observed, the opposite is true.  In re Opinions I, 2017 \nWL 427591, at *22.  Section 402 directs the executive branch to conduct a declassification \nreview of certain FISC opinions and to release either a redacted version or a summary \n\"consistent with national security.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a), (c).  But neither Section 402 nor any \nother section of the USA FREEDOM Act altered the non-public nature ofFISC proceedings, \nwhich continue, by statutory mandate, to be ex parte and subject to strict security measures.  In \nre Opinions I, 2017 WL 427591, at *22.  Moreover, in giving the executive branch responsibility \n8 \n\nfor conducting declassification reviews, Congress chose not to establish a procedure for \nobtaining FISC records \"from the Court.\" Id. \nAn additional reason why Section 402 does not signal a \"long tradition\" of public access \nto FISC proceedings, Motion 13, is that that provision applies only prospectively, and not to the \n37 years of opinions that predated its enactment.  A statute does not apply retroactively unless \nthere is a \"clear indication from Congress that it intended such a result.\" INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. \n289, 316 (2001); accord Landgrafv. USJ Film Products, 511U.S.244, 265 (1994) (holding that \n\"the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and \nembodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic\").  The text of Section 402 contains \nno such indication, in contrast to another, similar provision of FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1871(c) \n(requiring submission to Congress of certain FISA materials prospectively and retroactively \n\"during the 5-year period\" ending on the date of the provision's enactment).  Given that \nCongress clearly \"knows how to\" add such a provision \"[w]here [it] intends to,\" the \"absence of \nthis language\" in Section 402 \"instructs ... that Congress did not intend\" that Section 402 be \nretroactive.  Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 4 76 (2003). \nUnable to dispute the FISC's unbroken history as a non-public forum, the ACLU seeks to \nreframe the question as one about \"judicial rulings and opinions interpreting the Constitution and \nour laws.\" Motion 11.  But this is an \"incorrect framing of the question,\" Motion for Release JI,· \nat 6, as rulings interpreting law constitute neither a \"place\" nor a \"process.\" Press-Enterprise 11, \n478 U.S. at 8.  The experience test is applied \"to narrower classes that permit a meaningful \nassessment of the effects of public access on a particular type ofj udicial process-for example, \ndistrict court proceedings (and related records) that are ancillary to grand jury operations.\" \nMotion for Release 11, at 6 (citing Jn re Motions ofD  ow Jones & Co., 142 F .3d 496, 502-03 \n9 \n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998); United States v. Smith, 123 F .3d 140, 148-50 (3d Cir. 1997)) (emphasis in \noriginal).3  The ACLU's \"overly broad framing\" would \"encompass grand jury opinions, which \noften interpret the meaning and constitutionality of public statutes,\" but which are a \n'\"paradigmatic example' of proceedings to which no right of public access applies.\"  In re \n* \nOpinions I, 2017 WL 427591, at  19 (quoting In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F .3d 174, 183 (I st \nCir. 2003)). \nEven accepting the ACLU's flawed framing would not assist its ultimate argument as, \neven in court proceedings that are otherwise open to the public, there is no First Amendment \nright to access properly classified information contained in court filings or rulings.  Dhiab v. \nTrump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Op. of Randolph, J.) (observing that \"from the \nbeginning of the republic to the present day, there is no tradition of publicizing secret national \nsecurity information involved in civil cases, or for that matter, in criminal cases,\" as the \n\"tradition is exactly the opposite\"); NCR! v. Dep 't ofS tate, 251 F .3d 192, 208-09 (D.C. Cir. \n2001 ).  Indeed, courts routinely provide for classified material in otherwise public proceedings to \nbe withheld from the public.  E.g., Bismullah v. Gates, 501F.3d178, 194-204 (D.C. Cir. 2007) \n(providing for non-public filing of classified information through the Court Security Officer and \nprohibiting disclosure of classified information to unauthorized person), vacated on other \ngrounds, 554 U.S. 913 (2008); Northrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 751 F .2d 395, 401 \n3 A number of other cases also demonstrate the specificity with which courts define the \nprocess at issue in considering whether there is a history of public access.  See In re Application \nofN  ew York Times Co. To Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant Materials, 577 F .3d 401, 410-11 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (no right of access to sealed wiretap applications); United States v. El-Sayegh, 131 \nF.3d 158, 160-61 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (no First Amendment right of access to unconsummated plea \nagreements); Times Mirror Co. v.  United States, 873 F .2d 1210, 1213-14 (9th Cir. 1989) (no \nhistory of public access to search warrant proceedings and materials); In re Washington Post, \n807 F .2d 383, 389 (4th Cir. 1986) (the experience and logic tests apply to \"a particular kind of \nhearing\"). \n10 \n\n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (entering protective order sealing classified information); United States v. \nPoindexter, 732 F. Supp. 165, 167 (D.D.C. 1990) (holding that the right of access does not \nextend to classified proceedings in a criminal case).  Sometimes the content of classified \nproceedings and filings are withheld even from the opposing party.  E.g., United States v. \nSedaghaty, 728 F.3d 885, 908 (9th Cir. 2013); Jifry v. FAA, 370 F.3d 1174, 1182 (D.C. Cir. \n2004); Holy Land Found.for Relief&   Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 164 (D.C. Cir. 2003). \nWhen court opinions contain classified information, that information is redacted from any public \nrelease, or the opinion is withheld in full.  E.g., United States v. Daoud, 761F.3d678 (7th Cir. \n2014) (redacted opinion); Sedaghaty, 728 F.3d at 891 (\"we are filing concurrently, under \nappropriate seal, a classified opinion\"); United States v. Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749, at *2 (D. \nOr. June 24, 2014) (\"I am also filing an accompanying classified opinion to explain some of my \nreasoning.\"), afj'd, 843 F.3d 420 (9th Cir. 2016). \nMoreover, apart from the deferential standard applied in cases such as those brought \npursuant to the Freedom oflnformation Act (\"FOIA\"),4 see, e.g., Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, \n1124 (D.C. Cir. 2007), courts have long recognized that classification decisions are committed to \nthe executive branch.  See, e.g., Dep 't oft he Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988) (\"For \nreasons too obvious to call for enlarged discussion, the protection of classified information must \nbe committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible.\") (citation, quotation marks, and \nalteration omitted); Bismullah, 501 F.3d at 187-88 (\"[I]t is within the role of the executive to \nacquire and exercise the expertise of protecting national security [and] [i]t is not within the role \n4 Notably, all of the cases that the ACLU cites for the proposition that \"courts routinely \nscrutinize executive-branch classifications,\" Motion 27, are FOIA cases. See Center for Int 'l \nEnvironmental Law v. Office oft he U.S. Trade Rep., 718 F.3d 899 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Campbell v. \nUS. Dep'tofJ ustice, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Goldbergv. U.S. Dep'tofState, 818 F.2d 71 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987). \n11 \n\nof the courts to second-guess executive judgments made in furtherance of that branch's proper \nrole.\"); McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147-50 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding, in a case \nimplicating \"a strong first amendment interest,\" that the court's role was limited to \"merely ... \ndetermin[ing] that the CIA properly classified the deleted items\" and that the court \"cannot \nsecond-guess [the executive branch's] judgments on matters in which the judiciary lacks the \nrequisite expertise\"); United States v. Smith, 750 F.2d 1215, 1217 (4th Cir. 1984) (\"[T]he \ngovernment ... may determine what information is classified .... A court cannot question it.\"). \nIn this way, judicial deference to executive classification decisions is the same in other courts as \nit is in this Court.  See Motion for Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491 (holding that \"there is no role \nfor this Court independently to review, and potentially override, Executive Branch classification \ndecisions\"). \nBecause there is no history or tradition of access to FISC proceedings or records, the \nACLU's argument fails the experience test.  Moreover, even under the ACLU's erroneous \nframing, the argument fails because there is no First Amendment right of access to properly \nclassified material, and courts may not usurp the executive branch's authority to make \nclassification decisions. \nB.  The Logic Test \nPublic access to FISC proceedings also fails the \"logic\" test.  The FISC's \"entire docket \nrelates to the collection of foreign intelligence by the federal government.\" Motion for Release I, \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 487.  Its operations are governed \"by FISA, by Court rule, and by statutorily \nmandated security procedures issued by the Chief Justice of the United States,\" which together \n\"represent a comprehensive scheme for the safeguarding and handling of FISC proceedings and \nrecords.\" Id at 488.  As this Court has previously found, \"the detrimental consequences of broad \n12 \n\npublic access to FISC proceedings or records would greatly outweigh any\" benefits, and these \nharms \"are real and significant, and, quite frankly, beyond debate.\" Id. at 494.  In short, given \nthe national security sensitivities attendant to foreign intelligence collection, FISC proceedings \nare precisely the type of court process \"that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.\" \nPress-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8-9. \nOnce again, the ACLU seeks to reframe the question, arguing not for public access to \nFISC proceedings but for a supposed constitutional right to court-imposed declassification using \na standard that, as the ACLU would apply it, would not justify withholding any conceivable \nFISC opinion. See Motion 22 (asserting, without knowledge of how many classified opinions \nexist or what they contain, that \"the government cannot satisfy these strict standards in order to \njustify withholding\" any opinion sought).  But the Court-imposed declassification of 14 years of \nFISC opinions would similarly undermine the collection of foreign intelligence authorized by \nFISA. \nWere the FISC to engage in the review of executive branch classification decisions in the \nmanner suggested by the ACLU, the court \"might err by releasing information that in fact should \nremain classified,\" resulting in \"damage to the national security.\" Motion for Release I, 526 F. \nSupp. 2d at 495.  Such error, by any court undertaking the type of review suggested by the \nACLU, is likely given that even judges with expertise in national security matters cannot \"equal \n[the expertise] of the Executive Branch.\" Id. at 495 n.31; see also Egan, 484 U.S. at 529 \n(holding that predictive judgments related to national security risks \"must be made by those with \nthe necessary expertise in protecting classified information\"); El-Masri v. United States, 4 79 \nF.3d 296, 305 (4th Cir. 2007) (\"the Executive and the intelligence agencies under his control \noccupy a position superior to that of the courts in evaluating the consequences of a release of \n13 \n\nsensitive information\").  Additionally, the risk of disclosure \"would chill the government's \ninteractions with the Court,\" potentially leading to forgone surveillance of national security \nthreats.  Motion for Release I, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496 (citing Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. \n690, 699 (1996)).  It could also incentivize government officials to conduct surveillance without \nFISC approval where the need for such approval is unclear.  Id.  And, in cases that were brought, \n\"the free flow of information to the FISC that is needed for an ex parte proceeding to result in \nsound decisionmaking and effective oversight could also be threatened.\"  Id. \nIn short, the Court \"could not engage in a classification review more searching than that \nof a district court [in a FOIA case] without undue risk to the national security and the FISA \nprocess.\" Id.  Of course, \"there would be no point in this Court's merely duplicating the judicial \nreview that the ACLU, and anyone else, can obtain by submitting a FOIA request,\" id. at 496 \nn.32, and this Court would lack jurisdiction over such a claim in any event, see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(B). \nIt has been a decade since this Court first explained the significant harm that could result \nfrom the ACLU's suggested review, and the ACLU is still unable \"to explain why [it] believe[s] \nthis conclusion was flawed\" or to \"otherwise refute the Court's identification of the detrimental \neffects that could cause a diminished flow of information as a result of public access.\" In re \nOpinions/, 2017 WL 427591, at *20.  That is because there is no way that the non-deferential \njudicial review of executive branch classification determinations requested by the ACLU can be \nsquared with the need to protect national security.  For that reason, among others, the ACLU's \nproposal fails the logic test. \n14 \n\nIl.  The ACLU Cannot Assert Rights under FISC Rule 62 \nJust as the First Amendment provides the ACLU with no \"legally protected interest,\" \nRaines, 521 U.S. at 819, in access to FISC proceedings and rulings, the ACLU can assert no right \nof access pursuant to FISC Rule 62.  That rule provides that the process for publishing FISC \nopinions can begin sua sponte by the authoring judge \"or on motion by a party.\"  FISC, Rule of \nProcedure 62(a) (2010).  As the ACLU is neither an authoring judge of any opinion nor a party \nto any of the underlying cases at issue, Rule 62 gives it no rights.  Because the ACLU possesses \nno legally protected interest in access to FISC opinions, whether derived from the First \nAmendment, Rule 62, or any other source, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the ACLU's motion, \nand \"the Court may not consider any other legal arguments or requests for relief' from the \nACLU.5  In re Opinions I, 2017 WL 427591, at *21 n.17. \nAdditionally, Rule 62 is a rule of procedure for litigation pending before the Court, not a \nsubstantive right for the general public.  As such, it provides no cause of action that could \nsupport a claim.  For this reason as well, the ACLU's Rule 62 claim should be dismissed. \nIII.  The ACLU Has an Adequate Remedy in District Court \nThat this Court lacks jurisdiction over the instant motion should not obscure the fact that \nthe ACLU, and any citizen, has a route to seek access to those FISC opinions and portions of \nopinions that it believes are not properly classified.  As this Court informed the ACLU long ago, \n5 Even if the ACLU had standing to assert a First Amendment claim, it would still lack \nstanding to assert a claim based on Rule 62.  Because \"standing is not dispensed in gross,\" Town \nofC  hester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,_ U.S._, 2017 WL 2407473, at *5 (June 5, 2017) (quotation \nmarks omitted), \"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim [it] seeks to press\" and \n\"for each form of relief' it seeks.  Id. (quotation marks omitted); accord DaimlerChrysler \nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006) (quotation marks omitted).  To the extent that this \nCourt previously suggested otherwise in In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 of \nthe Patriot Act, 2013 WL 5460064, at *5 (PISA Ct. Sept. 13, 2013), it was in error.  This Court's \nmore recent opinion in In re Opinions I provides the correct analysis. \n15 \n\nthat process is the one set forth by the Freedom of Information Act.  See Motion for Release I, \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 497. \nIn fact, another organization is currently pursuing a similar category of FISC opinions \nthrough the FOIA process. See Electronic Frontier Found. v. US. Dep 't ofJ ustice, No. 3: 16-cv-\n2041-HSG (N.D. Cal.).  The Department of Justice has begun processing for potential release \nthose currently non-public FISC decisions, orders, and opinions that were submitted to Congress \nfrom July 1, 2003 to June 1, 2015 pursuant to the government's obligation to provide Congress \nwith all FISC rulings \"that include significant construction or interpretation\" of FISA.  See id., \nECF No. 39 (stipulation); 50 U.S.C. § 187l(a)(5). To the extent that the Department of Justice \nwithholds material on the basis of classification, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(l), the plaintiff will have \nthe option of seeking review of that determination by a district court applying a deferential \nstandard of review that, unlike the standard of review advanced here by the ACLU, will not pose \nundue risk of harm to national security.6 \n6 Of course, in the event that the government asserts any other FOIA exemptions in that \ncase, those too would be subject to district court review. \n16 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the ACLU's motion should be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction. \nJune 8, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nDANA J.

The motion invokes Rule 62 ofthe United \nStates Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Rules of Procedure and the qualified First \nAmendment right of access to compel the Court to disclose classified opinions and orders that \ncontain novel or signjficant interpretations of Jaw and were issued between September II, 200 I, \nand June 2, 2015.

See Mot. of the ACLU, the ACLU of the Nation's Capital, & MFIAC for the Release \nof Ct. Rs., Misc. No. 13-08 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. 2013), https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/ \ndefault/files/Misc%20 13-08%20Motion-2.pdf.  Four months ago, the United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review dismissed that motion in In re Opinions and Orders \n\nby I he FISC Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, 957 F.3d 1344 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. of Review Apr. 24, 2020) (per curiam).  The FISCR \nheld that it lacked jurisdiction over the petition seeking appellate review of then-Presiding Judge \nRosemary M. Collyer's February 11, 2020, decision denying the motion. !d. at 1358. \nThis Court is now convinced that exercising jurisdiction over the pending motion in this \nmatter would be inconsistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review's \ndecision.  The FISCR determined that it Jacked statutory subject-matter jurisdiction because \nCongress did not empower the federal courts established under FISA to consider constitutional \nclaims, a freestanding motion asserting a qualified First Amendment right of access did not fall \nwithin any of the FISCR'sjurisdictional categories enumerated in the statute, and the movants \nwere not among the parties authorized by the statute to seek FISCR review. !d. at 1350-51. \nNoting its \"significantly limited powers carefully delineated by Congress,\" the FISCR also \ndeclined to rely on the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to exercise discretionary authority over \nthe petition. !d. at 1356-57. It explained that such authority must be exercised with restraint, \ndiscretion, and great caution, id. at 1356, n.69 (citing Ex Parte Burr, 22 U.S. 529, 531 (1824)), \nand that the movants had not been involuntarily haled into court, did not seek to assert rights in \nan ongoing action, did not establish a factual connection to the classified material, and did not \npresent circumstances warranting the exercise of the FISCR's inherent judicial power to enforce \nits mandates and orders or protect the integrity of its proceedings and processes.  I d.  at 1356. In \naddition, because the \"crux\" ofthe movants' claim to disclosure \"[lay] within the Executive's \nclear authority to determine what material should remain classified,\" the FISCR concluded that \n\"respect for the separation of powers dictates that we dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction, \n2 \n\nas we have no business deciding the merits of the Movants' constitutional claim.\"  ld. at I 357 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nApplying the FISCR' s reasoning to whether this lower Court has jurisdiction over the \npending motion leads to the same result.  Like the FISCR, the FISC is not empowered by \nCongress to consider constitutional claims generally, First Amendment claims specifically, or \nfreestanding motions filed by persons who are not authorized by FISA to invoke this Court's \njurisdiction.  See id. at I 355 (stating that \"specialized courts like the FISC\" are not \"empowered \nto consider claims arising under the First Amendment to the Constitution\"), I 350-51; 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1801-1885c.  And because all ofthe above-described reasons why the FISCR found it \nunwarranted to exercise ancillary jurisdiction apply to the pending motion, the FISC is \nforeclosed from doing so here. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the Motion of the American Civil Liberties Union for \nthe Release of Court Records is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. \n_l_f!:_ \nSO ORDERED this  day of September, 2020. \n3 ",

That ruling does not collaterally estop litigation of the \nright of access question that is at issue here.

The Court should order declassification review under Rule 62 and apply the First \nAmendment standard to any proposed sealing by the government. ................................. 24 \nCONCLUSION ............................................................................................................................. 28 \n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nUnder the authority of the First Amendment and pursuant to Rule 62 of this Court's \nRules of Procedure, the American Civil Liberties Union (the \"ACLU\" or \"Movant\") respectfully \nmoves the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") to unseal its opinions and orders \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law issued between September 11, 200 l, and \nthe passage of the USA FREEDOM Act on June 2, 2015.1 Based on public disclosures, it is clear \nthat over the past fifteen years the FISC has developed an extensive body of law-one that \ndefines the reach of the government's surveillance powers and broadly affects the privacy \ninterests of Americans. Yet, even today, many of the FISC's significant opinions and orders have \nnot been disclosed to the public. These rulings appear to address a range of novel surveillance \nactivities, including the government's bulk searches of email received by Yahoo! customers; the \ngovernment's use of so-called \"Network Investigative Techniques\" (\"NITs\"), more commonly \nknown as \"malware\"; and the government's use of\"cybersignatures\" as a basis for surveillance \nconducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\").2 The Court's \nundisclosed rulings also appear to address the lawfulness of surveillance conducted under \nSection 702 of FISA-a controversial authority scheduled to expire in December 2017. The \nsignificant legal interpretations of this Court are subject to the public's First Amendment right of \naccess, and no proper basis exists to keep that legal analysis secret. \nCongress created this Court in 1978 to \"hear applications for and grant orders approving \nelectronic surveillance\" within the United States of foreign powers and their agents. FISA, Pub. \nL. No. 95-511, § 103, 92 Stat. 1783 (1978)(codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1803). Since the disclosures \n1 Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline \nOver Monitoring Act (\"USA FREEDOM Act\"), Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 267 (2015). \n2 In the attached Appendix, Movant has provided a non-exhaustive list of FISC rulings that it \nbelieves fall within the scope of this motion and have not yet been publicly released. \n\nthat began in June 2013, however, it has become increasingly apparent that the Court does more \nthan review individualized surveillance applications on a case-by-case basis. Rather, the Court's \nrole expanded over the past fifteen years to include programmatic approval and review of \ngovernment surveillance activities that affect countless Americans. \nThe Court's new role was accompanied by a growing body of secret law. In at least some \ninstances, the Court's interpretations departed significantly from the public understanding of the \nlaws at issue. See, e.g., ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F .3d 787, 812 (2015) (describing the \"expansive \nconcept of 'relevance\"' adopted by this Court in interpreting Section 215). During the past three \nyears, the Court has responded by making more of its precedent available to the public, including \nin response to a previous motion filed by the ACLU. See In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting \nSection 215 oft~e PATRIOT Act (\"In re Section 215 Orders\"), No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL \n5460064, at *7 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013); Opinion and Order Directing Declassification of Redacted \nOpinion (\"Declassification Order\"), In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISC Aug. 7, \n2014), http://l.usa.gov/lyekcfM. Congress, too, has responded by directing the government to \npublicly release significant opinions of this Court to the greatest extent practicable, as part of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act. See 50 U.S.C. § 1872. However, the government has taken the position \nthat its statutory disclosure obligation does not apply to opinions that predate the Act's passage \non June 2, 2015.3 As a result, a number of significant opinions and orders of this Court issued \nprior to June 2015 remain secret. \n3 See Gov't Mem., Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, No. 14-cv-00760 (D.D.C. Feb. 5, 2016) \n(ECF No. 28). But see Pl. Mot. for Partial Summ. J. & Opp., Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, No. \n14-cv-00760 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 13, 2016) (ECF No. 32); Sen. Ron Wyden, Press Statement (Oct. 7, \n2016) (\"The USA Freedom Act requires the executive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the Constitution.\"). \n2 \n\nThrough this Motion, the ACLU seeks access to these opinions and orders for two \nreasons. First, some of the opinions and orders pertain to surveillance programs that are already \nthe subject of considerable public debate-including the government's PRISM and Upstream \ncollection programs conducted pursuant to Section 702 of FISA. The public is entitled under the \nFirst Amendment to access the legal interpretations that define the limits of those programs. \nSecond, and more broadly, some of the opinions and orders relate to novel legal questions the \nCourt addressed as the government's surveillance activities expanded after September 11, 200 l, \nsuch as the use of court-authorized malware and the extension of FISA to cybersecurity \nactivities. These rulings are necessary to inform the public about the scope of the government's \nsurveillance powers today. \nThe ACLU's request for access to opinions and orders of this Court seeks to vindicate the \npublic's overriding interest in understanding how federal statutes are being construed and \nimplemented, and how constitutional protections for personal privacy and expressive and \nassociational activities are being enforced. The First Amendment guarantees the public a \nqualified right of access to those opinions because judicial opinions interpreting constitutional \nand statutory limits on governmental authorities-including those relevant to foreign-intelligence \nsurveillance-have regularly been available for inspection by the public, and because their \nrelease is manifestly fundamental in a democracy committed to the rule of law. Public disclosure \nserves to improve the functioning of the Court itself, to enhance its perceived fairness and \nindependence, and to educate citizens about the Court's role in ensuring the integrity of the FISA \nsystem. This First Amendment guarantee of public access may be overcome only if the \ngovernment is able to demonstrate a substantial probability of harm to a compelling interest and \nthe absence of any alternative means to protect that interest. Any limits on the public's right of \n3 \n\naccess must then be narrowly tailored and demonstrably effective in avoiding that harm. \nThe ACLU respectfully asks this Court to order the government to promptly process and \nprepare for publication opinions and orders of this Court containing novel or significant \ninterpretations of law, including but not limited to those identified in the Appendix. 4 Because the \nopinions are of critical importance to the ongoing public debate about the legitimacy and wisdom \nof the government's surveillance activities, the ACLU respectfully requests that the Court order \nthe publication of the opinions as quickly as possible, with only those redactions justified under \nthe stringent First Amendment standard. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn June 2013, various press outlets disclosed the existence of previously unknown \ngovernment surveillance programs, including the National Security Agency's bulk collection of \ntelephone metadata pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1861, and the PRISM and Upstream programs \noperated under Section 702 of FISA, which the government uses to seize and search vast \n5 \nquantities of Internet communications.  These news stories and subsequent reporting and \ndisclosures alerted the public to the existence of a growing body of important FISC rulings on \nmatters of significant public interest. While the FISC was created to hear individualized \n4 Movant notes that, since 2004, the government has been required to identify, summarize, \nand provide to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress \n\"significant\" legal interpretations ofFISA. 50 U.S.C. § 187l(a)(4)-(5); see also id.§ 1871(c). \nSimilarly, for FISC opinions related to § 702 of FISA, the executive branch is required to \ncategorize the Court's opinions as containing a significant legal interpretation or not. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 188lf(b)(l)(D) (requiring the government to provide copies to Congress of any FISC opinion \n\"that contains a significant legal interpretation of the provisions of [Section 702 of FISA ]\"). \nWhere there is a question as to whether an opinion or order constitutes a significant \ninterpretation of law, Movant requests that the Court make a determination as to the ruling's \nsignificance. \n5 See, e.g., Glenn Greenwald, NSA Collecting Phone Records ofM  illions of Verizon \nCustomers Daily, Guardian, June 6, 2013, http://gu.com/p/3gc62; Barton Gellman & Laura \nPoitras, U.S., British Intelligence Mining Datafrom Nine U.S. Internet Companies in Broad \nSecret Program, Wash. Post, June 7, 2013, http://wpo.st/eW7Yl. \n4 \n\nsurveillance demands, the orders and opinions that were published with the leaked documents \nrevealed that the FISC was also authorizing and overseeing several broad programs of \nsurveillance, relying on a body of its own opinions interpreting statutory and constitutional law. \nBecause FISC opinions were rarely published, the disclosures made the public aware that it was \nbeing (and had for some time been) denied access to a growing body of secret law. \nTo address the public's concerns that developed in the wake of these disclosures about \nthe legal foundations of the government's various surveillance programs, the government began \nto declassify and release significant information related to its surveillance activities. For \nexample, in the months immediately following the initial news stories about the government's \nbulk call-records program, the government released a white paper providing more details about \nthe program, its purported value, and its legal underpinnings. 6 And the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence (\"ODNI\") began a marked increase in its communications with the public \nabout the government's national-security surveillance programs. 7 \nThis Court also grasped the immense public interest surrounding the government's \nsurveillance activities and the need for public access to its opinions and orders. After the initial \ndisclosures in June 2013, this Court began to makes more of its opinions and orders available to \nthe public as a matter of course. 8 In In re Section 215 Orders, the Court acknowledged the \nimportant values served by the disclosure of these opinions. It noted that previous public \ndisclosures had \"engendered considerable public interest and debate\" and that further \n6 Administration White Paper: Bulk Collection ofT elephony Metadata Under Section 215 of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act (Aug. 9, 2013), http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/Section215.pdf. \n7 As one example of its increased outreach efforts, the ODNI began utilizing social media to \naddress these important matters of public concern and to release declassified documents, \nincluding opinions of this Court, to the public. See ODNI, IC on the Record, \nhttps://icontherecord.tumblr.com/. \n8 See generally Public Filings-FISC, http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings. \n5 \n\n9 \n\"[p] ublication of FISC opinions ... would contribute to that debate.\" The Court also \nunderscored the assertions by legislators of the \"value of public information and debate in \nrepresenting their constituents and discharging their legislative responsibilities,\" and affirmed \nthat \"[p]ublication would also assure citizens of the integrity of this Court's proceedings.\"10 \nLikely for the same reason, the Court's then-Presiding Judge published his correspondence with \nCongress explaining the FISC's operating procedures and detailing certain statistics concerning \nthe Court's approval of government applications.11 \nThe intense public interest triggered by the June 2013 surveillance disclosures has only \ngrown in the ensuing years. For almost three years, the American people have taken part in a \nwide-ranging public debate about the scope, interpretations, and appropriate bounds of our \nnation's surveillance laws. New details have continued to emerge about the government's \nprograms. 12 Executive-branch bodies have engaged in significant public oversight of \nsurveillance programs, conducting hearings with government and outside experts, and issuing \nreports on several programs that assess their legality and make recommendations on areas of \nconcern. 13 And Congress has actively engaged on the issue, including by passing legislation to \n9 In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7. \n10 Id.; see Mem. Op., In re Application oft he FBI/or an Order Requiring the Production of \nTangible Things from [Redacted], No. BR 13-158 (FISC Oct. 11, 2013), http://bit.ly/2e2yBly; In \nre Application oft he FBIf or an Order Requiring the Production.of Tangible Things from \n[Redacted], No. BR 13-109, 2013 WL 5741573, at *1 (FISC Aug. 29, 2013). \n11 See, e.g., Letter from Hon. Reggie B. Walton, Presiding Judge, FISC, to Hon. Patrick J. \nLeahy, Chairman, Comm. on the Judiciary (Oct. 11, 2013), http://bit.ly/2e2H8BH. \n12 See, e.g., Charlie Savage et al., Hunting/or Hackers, N.S.A. Secretly Expands Internet \nSpying at U.S. Border, N.Y. Times, June 4, 2015, http://nyti.ms/lGmFXEO (reporting that in \n2009 the NSA began conducting warrantless searches using patterns associated with computer \nintrusions-i.e., \"cybersignatures\"-and Internet protocol addresses as selectors). \n13 See, e.g., Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Bd. (\"PCLOB\"), Report on the Telephone \nRecords Program Conducted under Section 215 (2014), http://bit.ly/lSRiPke; President's \n6 \n\nend the government's bulk-collection activities and to require the publication of the very sorts of \nsignificant legal opinions sought through the ACLU's Motion.14 \nYet many of this Court's significant opinions and orders-some of which have been \nexplicitly referenced or described by the Court-have never been released to the public. For \nexample, news reports published earlier this month revealed the existence of a previously \nundisclosed order from this Court requiring Yahoo! to scan, in real time, all incoming email \ntraffic for a particular computer \"signature.\"15 To comply, Yahoo! reportedly developed a \ncustom scanning system and searched hundreds of millions of emails, storing and making \navailable to the FBI copies of any emails containing the signature(s) specified by the \ngovernment.16 The revelation of Yahoo!'s bulk email searching has drawn public alarm. Other \nmajor email providers, including Google and Microsoft, quickly moved to reassure their users \nthat they had not engaged in similar surveillance.17 Senator Ron Wyden expressed dismay and \ncalled on the executive branch to notify the public of any substantial changes to its surveillance \nauthorities, while Representative Ted Lieu challenged the program's constitutionality.18 Yet the \npublic still does not know the legal basis for the Yahoo! order. \nReview Grp. on Intelligence & Commc'ns Techs., Liberty and Security in a Changing World: \nReport and Recommendations (2013), http://l.usa.gov/lcBctOk. \n14 USA FREEDOM Act §§ 103, 201, 501; id § 402. \n15Joseph Menn, Exclusive- Yahoo Secretly Scanned Customer Emails/or U.S. Intelligence \nSources, Reuters (Oct. 4, 2016), http://yhoo.it/2cQh5vB; Charlie Savage & Nicole Perlroth, \nYahoo Said to Have Aided U.S. Email Surveillance by Adapting Spam Filter, N.Y.

Based on official disclosures and media reports, that \nbody of law appears to encompass, among other things: the government's use of malware, or \nNITs, in foreign-intelligence investigations, see Appendix, No. 2; the government's use of FISA \nto compel technology companies to weaken or circumvent encryption protocols, see id. No. 3; \nthe government's use of FISA to compel disclosure of source code from technology companies, \nsee id. No. 4; the government's use of\"cybersignatures\" as a basis for FISA surveillance, see id. \nNo. 5; the government's use of\"stingrays\" and other cell-site simulator technology in foreign-\nintelligence investigations, see id No. 7; and the CIA's and FBI's bulk collection of Americans' \nfinancial records, see id. No. 11. While Movant has identified many undisclosed opinions based \non existing public information, there are surely additional rulings of this Court that should \nlikewise be disclosed pursuant to the public's First Amendment right of access. 19 \nMovant, through this motion, seeks the public release of those controlling legal \ninterpretations. \nJURISDICTION \nAs a federal court established by Congress under Article III, this Court possesses inherent \npowers, including \"supervisory power over its own records and files.\" Nixon v.  Warner \nCommc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); accord Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 \n(1991) (\"It has long been understood that [c]ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our \nCourts ofj ustice from the nature of their institution.\"). As this Court has previously determined, \n19 By one estimate, there are at least 25 to 30 significant FISC opinions and orders issued \nbetween mid-2003 and mid-2013 that remain sealed, and several more that were issued in the \ntwo years prior to the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act. See Elizabeth Goitein, Brennan Ctr. \nfor Justice, The New Era ofS ecret Law 60-61 (2016), http://bit.ly/2eNep2g. \n8 \n\nthe FISC therefore has \"jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the \ncourt's very own records and files.\" In re Motion/or Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \n484, 487 (FISC 2007). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Movant has standing to bring this public-access motion. \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a party seeking judicial action must show \"(l) that it \nhas suffered an 'injury in fact'; (2) that the injury is caused by or fairly traceable to the \nchallenged actions of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.\" Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 306 F.3d 1144, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). As the Court found when addressing the \nACLU's 2013 motion, each element is met here. See In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL \n5460064, at *2-4. \nThe ACLU's injury here-a denial of access to court opinions-is concrete and \nparticularized. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court/or Cty. ofN  orfolk, 457 U.S. 596 \n(1982); Richmond Newspapers Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 576 (1980); N. Y. Civil Liberties \nUnion v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (\"NYCTA\"), 684 F.3d 286, 294-95 (2d Cir. 2011); In re Wash. \nPost, 807 F.2d 383, 388 n.4 (4th Cir. 1986). The ACLU actively participates in the legislative \nand public debates about the proper scope of the government's surveillance authorities, including \nthe lawfulness of Section 702 surveillance, the government's deployment ofmalware, and the \nmeaning of FISA's provisions.20 And plainly, the ACLU's injury is both caused by the denial of \npublic access to the opinions and orders sought here, see Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. \n20 See, e.g., Submission of ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer, PCLOB Public \nHearing on Section 702 ofFISA (Mar. 19, 2014), http://bit.ly/2djfoqM; Joe Uchill,ACLU \nQuestions How Tor Email Users Got FBI-Deployed Ma/ware, Hill, Sept. 6, 2016, \nhttp://bit.ly/2cIZ82T. \n9 \n\nUnited/or Separation ofC  hurch & State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982), and would be redressed by \nthe requested relief, see Town ofB  arnstable v. FAA, 659 F.3d 28, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \nII.  The First Amendment requires the release of this Court's opinions and orders \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law. \nA.  The First Amendment right of access attaches to judicial opinions, including the \nopinions of this Court concerning novel or significant interpretations of law. \nThat the judicial process should be as open to the public as possible is a principle \nenshrined in both the Constitution and the common law. See Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at \n564-73; Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. ofO  nondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"The common \nlaw right of public access to judicial documents is firmly rooted in our nation's history.\"); cf \nLetter from James Madison to W.T. Barry (Aug. 4, 1822), in 9 Writings ofJ ames Madison at 103 \n(G. Hunt ed. I 910) (\"A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of \nacquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both.\"). Under the Supreme \nCourt's prevailing \"experience and logic\" test, the First Amendment right of public access \nattaches to judicial proceedings and records where (a) the type of judicial process or record \nsought has historically been available to the public, and (b) public access plays a \"significant \npositive role\" in the functioning of the process itself. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court (\"Press-\nEnter. If'), 478 U.S. l, 9, 11 (1986); see Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 605-07; Wash. Post v. \nRobinson, 935 F.2d 282, 287-92 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Proceedings and records to which the right of \naccess attaches are presumptively open to the public and may be closed only where there is a \nsubstantial probability of harm to a compelling government interest, and where no alternative to \na narrow limitation of access can effectively protect against that harm. NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296. \nIn other words, the right of access is qualified but may not be denied without \"specific, on the \nrecord findings\" that \"closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to \n10 \n\nserve that interest.\" Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior \nCourt (\"Press-Enter. f'), 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984)). \nHere, there is a nearly unbroken tradition of public access to judicial rulings and opinions \ninterpreting the Constitution and our laws. Moreover, public access to such rulings allows the \npublic to function as an essential check on the government and improves judicial \ndecisionmaking. Those interests are particularly acute in the context of this Court's opinions \ninterpreting the reach and constitutionality of the government's surveillance authorities. Access \nwould enhance the functioning of this Court and the FISA system by facilitating effective public \noversight; increasing the legitimacy and independence of this Court; subjecting this Court's legal \nopinions to scrutiny within our common-law system; and permitting Congress, subject-matter \nexperts, and the broader public to evaluate this Court's legal interpretations as they consider \nchanges to the law. For these reasons, and as explained more fully below, the constitutional right \nof access extends to the opinions and orders of this Court concerning novel or significant \ninterpretations of law. \n1.  \"Experience\" \nNot only is there a nearly unbroken tradition of public access to judicial rulings and \nopinions interpreting the Constitution and the laws governing the American people, but Congress \nhas recently reaffirmed that tradition with respect to this very Court. See USA FREEDOM Act \n§ 402 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1872) (requiring decisions, orders, and opinions of the FISC \ncontaining \"significant construction[s] or interpretation[s] of any provision of law\" be made \n\"publicly available to the greatest extent practicable\"). \nNo type ofj udicial record enjoys a more uninterrupted history of openness than judicial \nopinions. As explained by the Third Circuit: \n11 \n\nAs ours is a common-law system based on the \"directive force\" of precedents, its \neffective and efficient functioning demands wide dissemination ofj udicial \ndecisions .... Even that part of the law which consists of codified statutes is \nincomplete without the accompanying body of judicial decisions construing the \nstatutes. Accordingly, under our system of jurisprudence the judiciary has the \nduty of publishing and disseminating its decisions. \nLowenschuss v.  W. Puhl 'g Co., 542 F .2d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1976) (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, \nThe Nature oft he Judicial Process 20, 21-22 (1963)); see Scheiner v. Wallace, No. 93-cv-0062, \n1996 WL 633226, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31, 1996) (\"The public interest in an accountable \njudiciary generally demands that the reasons for a judgment be exposed to public scrutiny.\" \n(citing United States v. Amodeo, 71F.3d1044, 1048-49 (2d Cir. 1995))). \nDissemination ofj udicial opinions is necessary both for the public to understand what the \nlaw is and to preserve the legitimacy of the judicial process. See U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. \nBonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 26 (1994) (\"[J]udicial precedents are ... valuable to the legal \ncommunity as a whole. They are not merely the property of private litigants.\"); accord \nLowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185; see also Union Oil Co. v. Leavell, 220 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir. \n2000) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"What happens in the halls of government is presumptively public \nbusiness. Judges deliberate in private but issue public decisions after public arguments based on \npublic records. The political branches of government claim legitimacy by election, judges by \nreason. Any step that withdraws an element of the judicial process from public view makes the \nensuing decision look more like fiat, which requires compellingjustification.\"). Accordingly, \nappellate courts have recognized that public access to opinions is protected by the First \nAmendment. Company Doe v. Public Citizen, 149 F.3d 246, 267-68 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding that \n\"it would be anomalous\" for the First Amendment to apply to some judicial records but not to \n\"the court's opinion itself'); United States v. Mentzos, 462 F.3d 830, 843 n.4 (8th Cir. 2006) \n(denying motion to file opinion under seal \"because the decisions of the court are a matter of \n12 \n\npublic record\"); Union Oil, 220 F.3d at 568 (\"[I]t should go without saying that the judge's \nopinions and orders belong in the public domain.\"). \nGiven this history, courts have customarily disclosed opinions dealing with the \ngovernment's authority to conduct investigations and gather information about individuals, \nparticularly U.S. citizens. For example, the First Amendment right of access has been held to \napply to judicial opinions construing the government's search and seizure powers. See In re \nApplication ofN . Y. Times Co. for Access to Certain Sealed Court Records, 585 F. Supp. 2d 83, \n88 (D.D.C. 2008). And federal courts have routinely published their opinions interpreting the \nscope and constitutionality of intelligence collection permitted under FISA and related \nauthorities-the very type of opinions the ACLU seeks here. See, e.g., United States v. U.S. Dist. \nCourt for the E. Dist. ofM  ich., 407 U.S. 297 ( 1972) (considering constitutionality of warrantless \nwiretapping program conducted by the government to \"protect the national security\"); United \nStates v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 72-74, 77 (2d Cir. 1984) (analyzing FISA's original \"purpose\" \nrequirement, and holding that \"FISA does not violate the probable cause requirement of the \nFourth Amendment\"); Jewel v. NSA, 673 F .3d 902, 905 (9th Cir. 2011) (reversing dismissal of \nlawsuit challenging \"widespread warrantless eavesdropping in the United States\"); Jn re \nApplication/or Pen Register & Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site LocationAuth. (\"Jn re PR/IT \nwith CSLf'), 396 F. Supp. 2d 747, 748-49 (S.D. Tex. 2005) (refusing government request to seal \nopinion \"because it concerns a matter of statutory interpretation\" and the issue explored \"has \nserious implications for the balance between privacy and law enforcement, and is a matter of first \nimpression\"). \nCritically, Congress has made the judgment that significant legal opinions and orders of \nthis Court do not fall outside our long tradition of judicial transparency. See USA FREEDOM \n13 \n\nAct§ 402. Recognizing the importance of the FISC's jurisprudence, Congress has explicitly \nrequired this Court's opinions and orders involving \"significant construction[s] or \ninterpretation[ s] of any provision of law\" be made \"publicly available to the greatest extent \npracticable.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a); see also id.§ 1872(b) (stating that redacted versions of \nopinions and orders may meet the statutory requirement). Congress set a high bar for \nwithholding such opinions and orders, and even where they can properly be withheld, the \nAttorney General must publicly release an unclassified statement summarizing their contents. Id. \n§ 1872(c ) (indicating non-disclosure is appropriate only where \"necessary to protect the national \nsecurity of the United States\" and outlining Attorney General's obligations when opinions and \norders are withheld). \nThat until recently FISC opinions were ordinarily sealed is of no moment to the First \nAmendment's \"experience\" test. The Supreme Court has instructed that the experience prong of \nits two-part test \"does not look to the particular practice of any one jurisdiction, but instead 'to \nthe experience in that type or kind of hearing throughout the United States ....\" 'El Vocero de \nP.R. v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per curiam) (quoting Rivera-Puig v. Garcia \nRosario, 983 F.2d 311, 323 (1st Cir. 1992)). In other words, the proper focus of the \"experience\" \nanalysis is the type of governmental process or record to which a petitioner seeks access, not the \npast practice of the specific forum in which such access is being sought. See, e.g., NYCTA, 684 \nF.3d at 301 (rejecting view that \"Richmond Newspapers test looks ... to the formal description \nof the forum\"); Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 94 (2d Cir. 2004) (examining \nFirst Amendment right of access to court \"docket sheets and their historical counterparts,\" \nbeginning with early English courts); In re Bos. Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st Cir. 2003) \n(experience test includes examination of \"analogous proceedings and documents\"). \n14 \n\nIn assessing how the past experience of access applies to a new forum, it is inappropriate \nto analyze only the history of that forum itself. Because there will never be a tradition of public \naccess in new forums, this approach would permit Congress to circumvent the constitutional \nright of access altogether---even as to, say, criminal trials-simply by providing that such trials \nhenceforth be heard in a newly created forum. See, e.g., NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 299 (\"Immunizing \ngovernment proceedings from public scrutiny by placing them in institutions the Framers could \nnot have imagined ... would make avoidance of constitutional protections all too easy.\"); In re \nCopley Press, Inc., 518 F.3d 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 2008). The proper approach, therefore, is to \nexamine whether the type of proceeding or record at issue-here, judicial opinions interpreting \nthe meaning and constitutionality of public statutes-has historically been open or available to \nthe public. See, e.g., NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 299. \n2.  \"Logic\" \nJust as fundamentally, public access to the opinions of this Court is important to the \nfunctioning of both the law in general and the FISA system in particular. \nThe \"significant positive role\" ofp ublic judicial decisionmaking in a democracy is so \nessential that it is hardly ever questioned. Courts have repeatedly recognized that public access to \njudicial opinions serves a vital function: \nThe decisions and opinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and \ninterpretations of the laws, which are binding upon all the citizens. They declare \nthe unwritten law, and construe and declare the meaning of the statutes. Every \ncitizen is presumed to know the law thus declared, and it needs no argument to \nshow that justice requires that all should have free access to the opinions, and that \nit is against sound public policy to prevent this, or to suppress and keep from the \nearliest knowledge of the public the statutes, or the decisions and opinions of the \njustices. Such opinions stand, upon principle, on substantially the same footing as \nthe statutes enacted by the legislature. It can hardly be contended that it would be \nwithin the constitutional power of the legislature to enact that the statutes and \nopinions should not be made known to the public .... The policy of the state \nalways has been that the opinions of the justices, after they are delivered, belong \nto the public. \n15 \n\nNash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35-36 (1886) (emphasis added) (cited by Banks v. Manchester, \n128 U.S. 244, 253-54 (1888)); see also Lowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185. The importance of public \naccess to judicial opinions flows from two bedrock principles: (1) the public's right to know \nwhat the law is, as a condition of democratic governance; and (2) the founding recognition that, \nin our political system, it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say \nwhat the law is.\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. ( 1 Cranch) 137, 177 ( 1803). Because courts \ndetermine what the law means-and therefore what the law is-the societal need for access to \njudicial opinions is paramount. \nThe value in making judicial opinions available to the public only increases where, as \nhere, the opinions concern both the power of the executive branch and the constitutional rights of \ncitizens. See FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir. 1987) (access to \ncourt files \"accentuated\" where \"the public's right to know what the executive branch is about \ncoalesces with the concomitant right of the citizenry to appraise the judicial branch\"); In re \nPR!ITwith CSLI, 396 F. Supp. 2d at 748-49 (refusing government request to seal order that \"has \nserious implications for the balance between privacy and law enforcement\"). \nThis principle applies with equal force in the context of national security, where the \ncourts routinely recognize and give effect to the public's right of access to judicial opinions and \norders. See, e.g., United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2008); In re Wash. Post, 807 \nF.2d at 393; United States v. Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 710, 716-17 (E.D. Va. 2007). In fact, \nwhere matters of national security are at stake, the role of public evaluation of judicial decisions \ntakes on an even weightier role. See, e.g., Jn re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 393; United States v. \nRessam, 221 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1262 (W.D. Wash. 2002); see also N.Y. Times Co. v. United \nStates, 403 U.S. 713, 719 (1971) (Black, J., concurring) (stating that \"fully aware of ... the need \n16 \n\nto defend a new nation,\" the Framers wrote the First Amendment \"to give this new society \nstrength and security\"); Det. Free Press v. Ashcroft, 303 F.3d 681, 709-10 (6th Cir. 2002) \n(finding invocation of non-specific \"national security\" concerns insufficient to overcome \npublic's qualified right of access to quasi-judicial proceedings). \nPublic access to the opinions of this Court is important to the functioning of the law and \nthe FISA system in several respects. \nFirst, public access to the opinions of this Court will promote public confidence in the \nintegrity, reliability, and independence of the FISC and the FISA system. Access to the reasoning \nand actions of this Court will allow the public to evaluate for itself the operation of the FISA \nsystem and the legal bases for the government's actions. As the Supreme Court has explained, \n\"[p] eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult \nfor them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\" Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 13 \n(quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Globe Newspaper, 451 U.S. at 606 (public access to court \ndocuments and proceedings \"fosters an appearance of fairness, thereby heightening public \nrespect for the judicial process\"); Aref, 533 F. 3d at 83 (\"Transparency is pivotal to public \nperception of the judiciary's legitimacy and independence.\"); In re Orion Pictures Corp., 21 \nF.3d 24, 26 (2d Cir. 1994) (public access \"helps safeguard the integrity, quality, and respect in \nour judicial system, and permits the public to keep a watchful eye on the workings of public \nagencies\" (quotation marks and citations omitted)); Ressam, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 1263 (explaining \nthat \"the general practice of disclosing court orders to the public not only plays a significant role \nin the judicial process, but is also a fundamental aspect of our country's open administration of \njustice\"). \n17 \n\nSecond, and relatedly, access to this Court's opinions will improve democratic oversight. \nBecause the information released to date does not fully describe the constitutional and statutory \nbases for the government's surveillance activities under FISA, the release of the requested \nopinions would permit the public-and Congress itself.-to more properly assess these programs \nand to take action accordingly. See generally Br. of Amici Curiae U.S. Representatives Amash et \nal. in Support of the Motion of the ACLU and MFIAC for the Release of Court Records, In re \nSection 215 Orders, No. 13-02 (FISC June 28, 2013), http://l.usa.gov/10RRcc4. Members of \nCongress have acknowledged the importance of proper oversight, but that oversight has been \nimpeded by the secrecy surrounding the Court's interpretations of the government's surveillance \npowers. See, e.g., Letter from Sens. Dianne Feinstein, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden & Mark Udall \nto Hon. John Bates, Presiding Judge, FISC (Feb. 13, 2013), http://bit.ly/2eeWOcf. Indeed, \nmembers of this Court have recognized the value of public disclosure of its opinions construing \nthe government's surveillance authority. See, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, \nat *7; cf. Ellen Nakashima & Carol D. Leonnig, Effort Underway to Declassify Document that Is \nLegal Foundation/or NSA Phone Program, Wash. Post, Oct. 12, 2013, http://wpo.st/qsYbl \n(\"[Judge] Kollar-Kotelly told associates this summer that she wanted her legal argument out, \naccording to two people familiar with what she said. Several members of the intelligence court \nwant more transparency about the court's role to dispel what they consider a misperception that \nthe court acted as a rubber stamp for the administration's top-secret spying programs.\"). As the \nSupreme Court noted in Richmond Newspapers, \"[ w ]ithout publicity, all other checks are \ninsufficient: in comparison of publicity, all other checks are of small account.\" 448 U.S. at 569 \n(quotation marks omitted) (quoting Jeremy Bentham, Rationale ofJ udicial Evidence 524 \n(1827)). In enacting the USA FREEDOM Act, Congress acknowledged these interests and \n18 \n\nsought to give the public access to the Court's significant legal pronouncements. See 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1872; 161 Cong. Rec. S2772-0 l, S2778-79 (statement of Sen. Blumenthal). \nThird, allowing the public to review and assess the reasoning of the opinions of this Court \nwill support more refined judicial decisionmaking in future cases. For example, since public \nattention focused on FISA surveillance and this Court's rulings beginning in June 2013, there has \nbeen a proliferation of highly sophisticated legal and technical debate over the foundations of the \ngovernment's various national-security surveillance programs.21 In camera decisionmaking \ncannot provide the Court with the same breadth of analysis and expertise, especially over the \nlong-term, because it does not allow for the same interplay and development of various \nviewpoints. The detailed public discussion that has begun today was impossible prior to the \nrelease of this Court's opinions, and it can only benefit the FISA system. \nFourth, publishing this Court's opinions of broad legal significance will contribute to the \nbody of decisional law essential to the functioning of our common-law system. Article III courts \nhave always built upon the work of their predecessors by refining, reworking, or even, at times, \nabandoning decisions issued in the past. See, e.g., Penny v. Little, 4 Ill. (3 Scam.) 301, 304 \n( 1841) (\"The common law is a beautiful system; containing the wisdom and experience of \nages.\"). This iterative process lies at the foundation of our legal system but has been stunted by \nthe continued secrecy of this Court's significant legal opinions. Other courts should have access \nto this Court's determinations relating to surveillance, new technologies, privacy, and First \nAmendment protections so that they may rely on, respond to, or distinguish this Court's \n21 See, e.g., Laura K. Donohue, Section 702 and the Collection ofI nternational Telephone and \nInternet Content, 38 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol'y 117 (2015), http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp \ncontent/uploads/2015/02/Donohue_Final.pdf; David S. Kris, On the Bulk Collection of Tangible \nThings, Lawfare Res. Paper Series (Sep. 29, 2013), http://bit.ly/2eKWyZT; Steven M. Bellovin \net al., It's Too Complicated: How the Internet Upends Katz, Smith, and Electronic Surveillance \nLaw, Harv. J. ofL. & Tech. (forthcoming 2016), http://bit.ly/2ectB8K. \n19 \n\nreasoning. 22 Both the FISC and ordinary federal courts have important perspectives to offer on \nemerging legal issues related to surveillance that inescapably cut across jurisdictions and even \nstatutes. That courts might, when permitted to engage in an open and good-faith debate about \nsuch matters, disagree-or agree-about the proper outcomes, is a strength of the common-law \nsystem-not a reason to keep one jurisdiction's law siloed and unavailable for logical \ndevelopment. See, e.g., Clapper, 785 F.3d 787; Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. \nInt'/ Comfort Prods., LLC, 585 F.3d 281, 287 (6th Cir. 2009) (agreeing with the FISCR that it is \nimportant to avoid a \"snowballing of precedent unconnected to the 'actual statutory language at \nissue\"') (citing In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 725-27 (FISCR 2002)). \nFor these reasons, disclosure of this Court's opinions addressing novel interpretations of \nthe government's surveillance authorities would contribute to the functioning of the FISA system \nand benefit the public interest. Cf. In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7 (stating \nthat \"movants and amici have presented several substantial reasons why the public interest might \nbe served by the[] publication\" ofFISC opinions interpreting Section 215). \n*  *  * \nIn sum, because there is a longstanding American tradition of public access to judicial \nopinions; because such access positively contributes to the integrity of the judicial process, the \ndemocratic legitimacy of this Court, and the public understanding of laws passed in its name; and \nbecause the release of the requested opinions and orders would illuminate crucial gaps in the \n22 See also, e.g., California v. Carney, 471U.S.386, 400-01 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) \n(\"The only true rules governing search and seizure have been formulated and refined in the \npainstaking scrutiny of case-by-case adjudication .... To identify rules that will endure, we must \nrely on the state and lower federal courts to debate and evaluate the different approaches to \ndifficult and unresolved questions of constitutional law. Deliberation on the question over time \nwinnows out the unnecessary and discordant elements of doctrine and preserves 'whatever is \npure and sound and fine.\"' (quoting Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature oft he Judicial Process 179 \n(1921 ))). \n20 \n\npublic knowledge about the legal justifications for its government's surveillance activities, the \npublic's First Amendment right of access attaches to the Court's legal opinions containing novel \nor significant interpretations of law. \nThis Court erred in concluding otherwise in denying a 2007 public-access motion brought \nby the ACLU. First, by limiting its analysis to whether two previously published opinions of this \nCourt \"establish a tradition of public access,\" the Court took too narrow a view of the \n\"experience\" prong of the Supreme Court's test. See In re Motion/or Release ofC  ourt Records, \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 493 (emphasis omitted). Again, \"the 'experience' test of Globe Newspaper \ndoes not look to the particular practice of any one jurisdiction, but instead to the experience in \nthat type or kind of hearing throughout the United States.\" El Vocero, 508 U.S. at 150 (quotation \nmarks omitted). Second, the Court erred in concluding that public access would \"result in a \ndiminished flow of information, to the detriment of the process in question.\" See In re Motion for \nRelease ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496. Instead, disclosure of the requested opinions \nwould serve weighty democratic interests by informing the governed about the meaning of \npublic laws enacted on their behalf. \nB.  The First Amendment requires disclosure of the Court's opinions containing \nnovel or significant interpretations of law. \nAlthough the First Amendment right of access is a qualified one, judicial records that are \nsubject to the right may be kept from the public only upon a rigorous showing. Different \nformulations have been used by various courts to define the showing that must be made, but the \ngoverning standard applied by the Supreme Court encompasses four distinct factors: \nl.  There must be a \"substantial probability\" of prejudice to a compelling interest. A \nparty seeking to restrict the right of access must demonstrate a substantial probability that \nopenness will cause harm to a compelling governmental interest. See, e.g., Press-Enter. \nII, 478 U.S. at 13-14; Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at 510; Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. \nat 580-81. In Press-Enterprise II, the Court specifically held that a \"reasonable \nlikelihood\" standard is not sufficiently protective of the right and that a \"substantial \n21 \n\nprobability\" standard must be applied. 478 U.S. at 14-15. This standard applies equally \nin the context of national security. See In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 392. \n2.  There must be no alternative to adequately protect the threatened interest. A party \nseeking to defeat access must further demonstrate that nothing short of a limitation on the \nconstitutional right of access can adequately protect the threatened interest. See Press \nEnter. II, 478 U.S. at 13-14; see also Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.S. 209, 214-15 (2010) \n(per curiam) (\"[T]rial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when \nthey are not offered by the parties\" and \"are obligated to take every reasonable measure \nto accommodate public attendance at criminal trials.\"); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d 93, \n100 (2d Cir. 1984) (A \"trial judge must consider alternatives and reach a reasoned \nconclusion that closure is a preferable course to follow to safeguard the interests at \nissue.\"); Robinson, 935 F.2d at 290. \n3.  Any restriction on access must be narrowly tailored. Even \"legitimate and substantial\" \ngovernmental interests \"cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \npersonal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\" Shelton v. Tucker, 364 \nU.S. 479, 488 (1960). Any limitation imposed on public access thus must be no broader \nthan necessary to protect the threatened interest. See, e.g., Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at \n13-14; Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124; Robinson, 935 F.2d at 287. \n4.  Any restriction on access must be effective. Any order limiting access must be effective \nin protecting the threatened interest for which the limitation is imposed. As articulated in \nPress-Enterprise II, the party seeking secrecy must demonstrate ''that closure would \nprevent\" the harm sought to be avoided. 478 U.S. at 14; see Robinson, 935 F.2d at 291-\n92 (disclosure could not pose any additional threat in light of already publicized \ninformation); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d at 101 (closure order cannot stand if \"the \ninformation sought to be kept confidential has already been given sufficient public \nexposure\"); United States v. Hubbard, 650 F .2d 293, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"One possible \nreason for unsealing is that the documents were already made public through other \nmeans.\"). \nThe party seeking to restrict access bears the burden of presenting specific facts that satisfy this \nfour-part test. See Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 15 (\"The First Amendment right of access cannot \nbe overcome by [a] conclusory assertion.\"). \nThe government cannot satisfy these strict standards in order to justify withholding the \nFISC's significant and novel opinions and orders in full. The proposition that the government has \nan interest-let alone a \"compelling\" one-in preventing disclosure of this Court's opinions on \nnovel or significant interpretations of FISA is insupportable. In fact, a public accounting of this \nCourt's legal analysis would serve governmental interests by clarifying the scope of the \n22 \n\ngovernment's surveillance powers and the legal reasoning supporting them. See, e.g., Nakashima \n& Leonnig, supra (quoting current and fonner government officials advocating for release of \noriginal FISC bulk-collection opinion). Even the General Counsel of the ODNI has recognized \nthe importance of publicly discussing the legal framework under which the government conducts \nits surveillance programs and of\"demystify[ing] and correct[ing] misimpressions\" the public \nmay have about the government's surveillance activities. ODNI, General Counsel Robert Litt 's \nas Prepared Remarks on Signals Intelligence Reform, IC on the Record (Feb. 4, 2015), \nhttp://bit.ly/2e2J 1O  M. \nOf course, portions of the Court's opinions may be sealed to serve compelling \ngovernmental interests-for example, to protect intelligence sources and methods that have not \nbeen previously disclosed-but the First Amendment requires the Court itself to ensure that any \nredactions are narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Cf. Pepsico, Inc. v. Redmond, 46 F.3d 29, \n31 (7th Cir. 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"The judge must make his own decision about what should \nbe confidential ... and what may be spoken of openly. I regret that this means extra work for the \njudge, but preserving the principle that judicial opinions are available to the public is worth at \nleast that much sacrifice.\"); Nakashima & Leonnig, supra (quoting former senior DOJ attorney \nKenneth Wainstein as arguing that \"[e]specially when it comes to legal decisions about big \nprograms, ... we can talk about them in a sanitized way without disclosing sources and \nmethods\"). This Court itself has rejected the government's overbroad classification claims in \nreleasing opinions in the past. See Declassification Order at 6-7, In re Section 215 Orders. \nImportant to the analysis here will be the numerous disclosures made to date, which provide \ncritical context for assessing any claim that disclosure of the rulings sought here would hann the \ngovernment's interests. See, e.g., Merrill v. Lynch, 151 F. Supp. 3d 342, 350 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) \n23 \n\n(ordering release of details of challenged national-security letter and relying heavily on previous \ndisclosures to find that the government had \"not demonstrated a good reason\" to expect harm \nwould arise as a result of the ordered release); Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 78 (D. \nConn. 2005) (relying in part on \"the nature and extent of information about the [national-security \nletter] that has already been disclosed by the defendants\" in determining that \"the government \nhas not demonstrated a compelling interest in preventing disclosure of the recipient's identity\"). \nIII.  The Court should order declassification review under Rule 62 and apply the First \nAmendment standard to any proposed sealing by the government. \nIn implementing the constitutional right of access to opinions concerning novel or \nsignificant interpretations of law, the Court should first order the government to conduct a \ndeclassification review of the opinions pursuant to FISC Rule 62(a). See, e.g., In re Section 215 \nOrders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7; Declassification Order at 5-7, In re Section 215 Orders \n(discussing FISCjudge's review of proposed redactions); Order, In re Application oft he FBI/or \nan Order Requiring the Production ofTangible Thingsfrom [Redacted], No. BR 13-109 (FISC \nAug. 23, 2013), http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%2013-109%200rder-2.pdf \n(discussing sua sponte request by FISC judge to publish memorandum opinion under FISC R.P. \n62(a)); In re Directives [Redacted] Pursuant to Section 105B oft he Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, 551 F .3d 1004, I 016 (FISCR 2008). \nIf, after the completion of that review, the government proposes to redact any information \nin the Court's opinions, the Court should set a briefing schedule, requiring the government to \njustify how its sealing request meets the constitutional standard set out above, and allowing the \nACLU to contest any sealing it believes to be unjustified. Although the Court should give due \nconsideration to the government's predictive judgments of harm to national security, it should \nnot simply defer to those judgments or to the results of the government's declassification review. \n24 \n\nSee, e.g., In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 392. The First Amendment right of access is a \nconstitutional right that belongs to the public, and that right can be overcome only upon specific \nfindings by a court, including a finding that disclosure would risk a substantial probability of \nharm to a compelling interest. See supra Part II.B. 23 \nIndependent judicial review of any proposed redactions from this Court's opinions is \nnecessary because-as was made clear in In re Section 215 Orders when the ACLU moved this \nCourt for public access to other FISC opinions-the standards that justify classification do not \nalways satisfy the strict constitutional standard, and because executive-branch decisions cannot \nsubstitute for the judicial determination required by the First Amendment. Declassification Order \nat 10-11, In re Section 215 Orders (applying First Amendment standard to this Court's review of \nthe government's second redaction proposal). Specifically, information may be classified on a \nsimple determination by the executive branch that \"the unauthorized disclosure of [the \ninformation] reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.\" Exec. \nOrder No. 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, § l .2(a) (Dec. 29, 2009) (emphasis added). The First \nAmendment, however, can be overcome only upon a showing of a \"substantial probability\" of \nharm, a standard that the Supreme Court has specifically held to be more stringent than a \n\"reasonable likelihood\" test. Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 14. Moreover, under the classification \nregime, the executive branch alone decides whether to consider the public's interest in \ndisclosure, and it does so only in \"exceptional cases.\" Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 3.l(d). Applying \nthat standard to judicial records would flatly contradict the First Amendment right of access, \n23 In evaluating the government's declassification review of FISC opinions in response to the \nACLU's prior motion in this Court, the Court noted that the government's proposed redactions \n\"passe[d ] muster\" under the First Amendment standard, even while declining to reach the \nultimate question whether the First Amendment right of access applied. See Declassification \nOrder at 9, n.10, In re Section 215 Orders. \n25 \n\nwhich presumes that the public's interest is in disclosure, and permits sealing only if there are no \nless-restrictive alternatives and ifthe limitation on access is narrowly tailored. \nIndeed, judicial intervention in and oversight of government declassification of sealed \njudicial opinions has led to the release of additional information to which the public was entitled. \nIn In re Section 215 Orders, after this Court ordered a declassification review of a FISC opinion, \nthe government determined that the opinion should be \"withheld in full,\" but the FISC judge \ndemanded \"a detailed explanation\" of why the opinion could not be released in redacted form. \nOrder, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISC Nov. 20, 2013), \nhttp://l.usa.gov/258tRH8. In response, the government agreed to release the opinion in redacted \nform, but it took multiple proposals before this Court was satisfied that all redactions were \nsufficiently narrowly tailored. Declassification Order at 5-7, In re Section 215 Orders \n(describing this Court's back-and-forth with the government on proposed redactions to the \nopinion). Similarly, careful judicial review of redactions in other cases has led to greater \ndisclosure than the government initially proposed. See, e.g., Order, In re Directives Pursuant to \n§ 105B ofF ISA, No. 105B(g) 07-01 (FISC Feb. 5, 2016), http://l.usa.gov/lOibClC (ordering the \ngovernment to respond to FISC judge's concerns \"about the scope of certain proposed \nredactions\" in response to an earlier order to conduct a declassification review of documents \nfiled in the case). \nFurthermore, whether the public's constitutional right of access is outweighed by a \ncompelling interest in continued sealing is a question for the courts, not one that rests with the \nexecutive. See Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 13-14. As the Fourth Circuit has forcefully explained, \n[T]roubled as we are by the risk that disclosure of classified information could \nendanger the lives of both Americans and their foreign informants, we are equally \ntroubled by the notion that the judiciary should abdicate its decisionmaking \nresponsibility to the executive branch whenever national security concerns are \n26 \n\npresent. History teaches us how easily the spectre of a threat to \"national security\" \nmay be used to justify a wide variety of repressive government actions. A blind \nacceptance by the courts of the government's insistence on the need for secrecy, \nwithout notice to others, without argument, and without a statement of reasons, \nwould impermissibly compromise the independence of the judiciary and open the \ndoor to possible abuse. \nJn re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 391-92; see United States v. Hershey, 20 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A. \n1985) (\"[E]ven when the interest sought to be protected is national security, the Government \nmust demonstrate a compelling need to exclude the public ....\"  (emphasis omitted)); United \nStates v. Grunden, 2 M.J. 116, 122 (C.M.A. 1977) (although classification and the policy \ndeterminations it involves \"are not normal judicial functions, immunization from judicial review \ncannot be countenanced in situations where strong countervailing constitutional interests exist\"). \nIn other contexts, too, courts routinely scrutinize executive-branch classifications. See, \ne.g., Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F .3d 20, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Goldberg v. DOS, 818 F .2d 71, 76 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987). This principle is not controversial, and in other forums, the government has \nexpressly accepted it. See, e.g., Final Reply Br. for Appellants at 8 n.l, Ctr.for lnt'l Envtl. Law \nv. Office oft he U.S. Trade Rep., No. 12-5136 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 27, 2012), 2012 WL 5940305 \n(clarifying that the government has not \"suggested that the Executive's determination that a \ndocument is classified should be conclusive or unreviewable\"). \nFor these reasons, merely ordering discretionary release under Rule 62(a) after executive \ndeclassification review would not satisfy the constitutional right of access. The Court should thus \norder declassification review as a first step and then test any sealing proposed by the government \nagainst the standard required by the First Amendment. Of course, even if the Court holds that the \nFirst Amendment right of access does not attach to the legal opinions requested by Movant, it \nshould nonetheless exercise its discretion-as it has in the past and in the public interest-to \n27 \n\norder the government to conduct a declassification review of its opinions pursuant to Rule 62. \nSee, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movant respectfully requests that this Court unseal its \nopinions and orders containing novel or significant interpretations of law, including but not \nlimited to those described in the Appendix, with only those limited redactions that satisfy the \nstrict test to overcome the constitutional right of access. \nDated: October 18, 2016  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

MISC. 13-08 & 16-01 \nFor reasons of judicial economy and to avoid unnecessary delay, Movants respectfully \nrequest that the Court join Docket Nos. Misc. 13-08 and 16-01 for resolution. \nThe Court has ordered the parties to brief the question of subject matter jurisdiction in \nNo. Misc. 13-08, which was filed on November 7, 2013. See Mot. for Release of Court Records \n(No. Misc. 13-08). Presently pending before the Court is another right-of-access motion filed by \nMovant American Civil Liberties Union on October 19, 2016. See Mot. for Release of Court \nRecords (No. Misc. 16-01 ). That motion seeks access to FISC opinions containing novel or \nsignificant interpretations of law issued between September 11, 2001, and the passage of the \nUSA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015.1 The motion was fully briefed on the merits nearly a year \nago, as of June 29, 2017. Nonetheless, no decision has been issued nor has the Court requested \nadditional briefing from the parties on any of the jurisdictional issues raised in this proceeding. \n1 \nUniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline \nOver Monitoring Act (\"USA FREEDOM Act\"), Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015). \n\nBecause the legal issues raised by the two motions overlap extensively, including the \nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction addressed in the briefing underway in No. Misc. 13-08, \nMovants respectfully request that the Court join the two matters for resolution. Consideration of \nthe two motions together will significantly promote judicial economy because it will allow both \ncases to be fully briefed and addressed in this Court without delay-and will avoid the need for a \nfurther round of jurisdictional briefing in No. Misc. 16-01, where the parties have not had the \nopportunity to address these issues. Proceeding sequentially, by contrast, will extend the timeline \nfor resolution and add to the Court's workload. Given the similarity of the claims of access \nunderlying both motions, consolidation will align both matters for an ultimate decision. 2 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that the Court consolidate \nDocket Nos. Misc. 13-08 and 16-01 for resolution. \nDated: June 13, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

      "text": "  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  1 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION v. \n UNITED STATES  \nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \nSTATES FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE  \nCOURT OF REVIEW  \nNo. 20–1499.  Decided November 1, 2021  \n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. \nJUSTICE  GORSUCH,  with  whom  JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR  \njoins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. \n  In response to allegations of wrongdoing by the Nation’s \nintelligence agencies, in 1975 Congress convened a select \ncommittee chaired by Senator Frank Church to investigate. \nSee S. Rep. No. 94–755, p. v (1976). Ultimately, the Church \ncommittee issued a report concluding that the federal gov-\nernment  had,  over  many  decades,  “intentionally  disre-\ngarded” legal limitations on its surveillance activities and \n“infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens.”  \nId., at 137.  \n  In the wake of these findings, Congress enacted the For-\neign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. See 92 Stat. 1783 \n(codified at 50 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.). The statute created \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and em-\npowered it to oversee electronic surveillance conducted for \nforeign intelligence purposes. See §1803(a). The statute also \ncreated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Re-\nview (FISCR) to hear appeals from the FISC’s rulings. The \nFISC now comprises 11 Article III federal district court \njudges, and the FISCR comprises 3 additional Article III \njudges. §§1803(a)–(b).\n  With changes in technology and thanks to various legis-\nlative amendments, these courts have come to play an in-\ncreasingly important role in the Nation’s life. Today, the \n\n2  ACLU v. UNITED STATES  \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nFISC evaluates extensive surveillance programs that carry \nprofound  implications  for  Americans’  privacy  and  their \nrights to speak and associate freely. See, e.g., ACLU v.  \nClapper, 785 F. 3d 787, 818 (CA2 2015). Like other courts, \nthe FISC may announce its rulings in opinions that explain \nits interpretation of relevant statutory and constitutional \nlaw. Unlike most other courts, however, FISC holds its pro-\nceedings in secret and does not customarily publish its de-\ncisions. See §1803(c); In re Motion for Release of Court Rec-\nords, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 488 (FISC 2007). \n  In  2016,  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  (ACLU)\nsought to test this practice. It filed motions with the FISC \nasserting that the First Amendment provides a qualified\nright of public access to opinions containing significant le-\ngal analysis—even if portions must be redacted. App. to \nPet. for Cert. 21a. The ACLU argued that the FISC had au-\nthority  to  consider  its  motion  pursuant  to  its  inherent \n“power over its own records and files.” Id., at 18a (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted).  The  organization  noted  that \nother courts have a long history of exercising just this power \nto ensure public access to their judicial decisions. In the \nend, however, both the FISC and the FISCR refused the \nACLU’s request. In fact, they refused even to consider the \nquestion, claiming they lacked authority to do so. Id., at 2a– \n7a (citing 50 U. S. C. §1803(k); 28 U. S. C. §1254(2)).\n  Now the ACLU has filed a petition for certiorari asking \nthis Court to review these decisions. In response, the gov-\nernment does not merely argue that the lower court rulings \nshould be left undisturbed because they are correct. The \ngovernment also presses the extraordinary claim that this \nCourt is powerless to review the lower court decisions even \nif they are mistaken. On the government’s view, literally no  \ncourt in this country has the power to decide whether citi-\nzens possess a First Amendment right of access to the work \nof our national security courts.\n  Today the Court declines to take up this matter. I would  \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  3 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nhear it. This case presents questions about the right of pub-\nlic access to Article III judicial proceedings of grave national \nimportance. Maybe even more fundamentally, this case in-\nvolves a governmental challenge to the power of this Court \nto review the work of Article III judges in a subordinate \ncourt. If these matters are not worthy of our time, what is? \nRespectfully, I dissent. ",

See No. Misc.  16-01, 2020 WL 5637419 (FISC \nSept. 15, 2020). This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to review that ruling. \nThe  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  (\"FISA\")  gives  this  Court \njurisdiction  to  hear  petitions  from  the  denial  of  \"application[s],\" \n50 U.S.C. § 1803(b), including Movant's motion. But even if the statute did not, the \nFISC's and FISCR's inherent authority over their own judicial records-as Article \nIll courts-places this petition squarely within both the ancillary and mandamus \njurisdiction of this Court. A court's supervisory power over its own opinions is so \nfundamental to its judicial function that it would violate the separation of powers for \nCongress to strip the FISC and FISCR ofj urisdiction to consider motions for access \nto their opinions. Moreover, denying Movant a forum  in  which to claim a First \nAmendment right of access to the FISC's and  FISCR's opinions  would  raise a \n\"serious constitutional question.\" Webster v.  Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988). But \n1 E.g., In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection, \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2020 WL 897659, at *3-*6 (FISC Feb. 11, 2020); In reMotion \nfor Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 486-87 (FISC 2007). \n\nthat is the implication of the FISC's ruling and this Court's prior decision in In re \nOpinions & Orders by the FISC Addressing Bulk Collection, 957 F.3d 1344 (FISCR \n2020). \nThe FISCR should clarify or revisit its prior ruling. The FISCR's holding that \nit lacked appellate jurisdiction over a motion for release of FISC records did not \nclosely examine either the FfSC's or the FISCR's inherent powers as Article III \ntribunals, nor did  it fully consider the constitutional  implications of its holding. \nCompare In re Opinions, No. Misc. 13-08, 2020 WL 897659, at *4. Alternatively, \nthe jurisdictional questions raised by this litigation are of such consequence that the \nCourt should certify them to the Supreme Court. See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(k). \nARGUMENT \nI.  FISA grants this Court jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Movant's \naccess motion. \nThis Court's statutory jurisdiction extends to reviewing \"the denial of any \napplication made under this chapter.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b) (emphasis added). The \nordinary meaning of \"any application\" in 50 U.S.C. §  1803(b) is just that-\"any \napplication.\" See Ali v.  Fed. Bureau ofP  risons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 (2008) (\"[R]ead \nnaturally,  the  word  'any'  has  an  expansive  meaning,  that  is,  one  or  some \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\"). Movant's application seeking access to FISC \nopinions arose under ''this chapter\" because the FISC was created by, and issues its \nopinions pursuant to authority it receives from, FISA. \n2 \n\nThe Court rejected this reading of the statute in In re Opinions, 957 F.3d at \n1351. Movant respectfully submits that the Court's interpretation is inconsistent with \nthe statute as a whole. Where Congress intended to refer only to applications \"for \nelectronic  surveillance,\"  it  was  specific.  See,  e.g.,  50  U.S.C.  § 1803(a)(l) \n(\"application for electronic surveillance\"). By contrast, the term \"any application \nmade under this chapter\" encompasses applications like Movant's. !d.  § 1803(b) . \nIndeed,  the  Court's  narrow  reading  of \"any  application\"  is  likely  to  frustrate \nappellate  review  in  ways Congress  could  not have  intended. For example,  that \nreading could prevent the government from appealing a variety ofFISC orders, such \nas  orders  exercising  the  FISC's  discretion  to  publish  its  opinions,  and  orders \nsanctioning government officials for misconduct. Similarly, a narrow reading of \n\"application\" could prevent both the government and communications providers \nfrom appealing contempt rulings by the FISC, such as when a provider challenges a \nsurveillance order and the government seeks to compel immediate compliance. \nMore generally, Congress intended the FISC and FISCR to have jurisdiction \nover matters- like Movant's motion for access or like a motion for contempt- that \nare  inextricably  intertwined  with  the  FISC's  proceedings.  See  id.  § 1803(g)(l) \n(authorizing the FISC and FISCR to ''take such actions, as are reasonably necessary \nto administer their responsibilities under this chapter''); id.  § 1803(h). \nIf FISA leaves any doubt as to this Court's statutory authority to review the \n3 \n\nFISC's jurisdictional holding, the Court can resolve that doubt by analogy to the \ncollateral-order doctrine, which has supplied authority to entertain appeals in other \npublic access cases in the federal appellate courts. See, e.g., In re N.Y.  Times Co., \n828 F.2d 110, 113 (2d Cir.  1987); United States v. Chagra, 701  F.2d 354,358-60 \n(5th  Cir.  1983); United States  v.  Criden, 675  F.2d  550,  552  (3d  Cir.  1982). In \nestablishing that doctrine, the  Supreme Court applied  a \"practical  rather than a \ntechnical construction\" to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, permitting appeals from interlocutory \ndecisions \"which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, \nrights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent \nof the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred.\"  Cohen  v. \nBeneficia/Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949). \nThis Court has reasoned that the collateral-order doctrine applies solely to the \njurisdiction conferred by§ 1291. In re Opinions, 957 F.3d at 1355. But nothing about \nthe  Supreme  Court's reasoning  was  limited  to  § 1291,  and  the  same  practical \nconsiderations should guide this Court's interpretation of§ 1803. Namely: there is a \nfinal decision from the FISC; it presents an issue collateral to those raised in the \nunderlying FISC proceedings; and there is a risk of irreparable harm to constitutional \ninterests that are \"too important to be denied review.\" Cohen, 337 U.S. at 546. \nII.  This Court also has ancillary jurisdiction. \nAs Article III courts, the FISC and FISCR have inherent supervisory power \n4 \n\nover their own records and dockets. Nixon v. Warner Commc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, \n598 ( 1978). That power is especially essential to the FISC and FISCR in light of the \nsensitive nature of their proceedings. Given the need to ensure uniform rules for \npublic access, the FISCR necessarily has ancillary jurisdiction to review a FISC \nruling on a motion for access to court records. \nFederal courts may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over claims outside of their \nexplicit statutory grants when doing so \"enable[s]\" them ''to function successfully.\" \nKokkonen  v.  Guardian Life Ins. Co.  of Am., 511  U.S.  375, 379-80 (1994). The \n\"doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction . . . recognizes federal courts' jurisdiction over \nsome  matters  (otherwise  beyond  their  competence)  that are  incidental  to  other \nmatters properly before them.\" !d. at 378. \nA  court's  control  over  its  own  opinions,  records,  and  proceedings  is \n'fundamental.\" Gambale v.  Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 140 (2d Cir. 2004). \nYet the FISCR's prior ruling concluded that a motion for access to FISC opinions \nwas  too  far  removed  from  this  Court's  essential  functions  to  support  ancillary \njurisdiction. See In re Opinions, 957 F.3d at 1356. Respectfully, that ruling did not \nconsider the FISC's and FISCR's inherent power to control access to their own \nrecords, nor did  it  reckon with the consequences of ruling  that jurisdiction  lies \ninstead in a coordinate court. Cf In reMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. \nSupp. 2d 484, 486- 87 (FISC 2007) (\"[I]t would be quite odd if the FISC did not \n5 \n\nhave jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the court's very \nown  records and  files.\"). There is  no evidence,  let alone a clear statement, that \nCongress  intended to strip the FISC and FISCR of this inherent power.  To the \ncontrary,  FISA  expressly  preserves  such  powers.  50  U.S.C.  § 1803(g)(l ),  (h) \n(\"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to reduce or contravene the inherent \nauthority of a court established under this section . ...\" ). \nTo function successfully, this Court must have authority to review the FISC's \ndecisions concerning access to its opinions. One of the Court's responsibilities under \nFISA is the proper handling of records that contain classified information. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1803(c). Accordingly, this Court's rules require it to comply with a set of statutes \nregarding information security. FISCR R.  P. 3. To ensure such compliance, this \nCourt must be able to control its own docket and papers, and it must be able to \nsupervise the FISC's exercise of the same power- both to ensure consistency and \nbecause,  in  practice,  the  record  in  any  given  FISC  proceeding  is  likely  to \nsubstantially overlap with that in a related FISCR proceeding. As a result, this Court \nhas ancillary jurisdiction to rule on motions for access to its own records, and it also \nhas ancillary jurisdiction to review petitions for access to FISC records.2 \n2 Where court records are at issue, ancillary jurisdiction remains even after the \nunderlying proceeding has concluded. See Movants' Br. 8- 12, In re Opinions, \nNo. Misc. 13-08 (FISC June 13, 2018), https://perma.cc!UDY4-YD8B. \n6 \n\nIII.  The Court may review the FISC's decision through Movant's petition \nfor a writ of mandamus. \n\"[S]upervisory control of the District Courts by the Courts of Appeals is \nnecessary to proper judicial administration in the federal system.\" La Buy v. Howes \nLeather Co., 352 U.S. 249,259-60 (1957). The Supreme Court and federal appeals \ncourts have long relied on the writ of mandamus as a vehicle for that supervision. \nSee id.; accord,  e.g.,  United States v. Lasker, 481  F.2d 229, 235 (2d Cir.  1973); \nDellinger v. Mitchell, 442 F .2d 782, 790 (D.C. Cir. 1971 ). This Court is no different: \nit exercises supervisory control over the FISC just as federal appeals courts do over \nfederal district courts. See, e.g., 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b), U); id.  § 188la(i)(6). \nAccordingly, this Court may issue writs of mandamus under the All  Writs \nAct, which authorizes \"[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of \nCongress\" to \"issue  all  writs  necessary or appropriate in  aid of their respective \njurisdictions,\" 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (a), including a \"writ of mandamus against a lower \ncourt,\" Cheney v.  U.S.  Dist. Ct., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004). The FISCR is a court \nestablished by Congress, see 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b), and it has recognized in its own \nrules that it has the power to issue writs of mandamus, see FISCR R. P. 8. \nHere,  there are at least two sources of authority permitting the FISCR to \nentertain Movant's petition for a writ. First, as noted above, Congress has authorized \nthe Court to \"take such actions ... as are reasonably necessary to administer [its] \nresponsibilities under this chapter,\" 50 U.S.C. § 1803(g)(1 ), including those related \n7 \n\nto managing access to classified information, see id.  § 1803(c ). This responsibility, \nas well as the Court's inherent authority over its own records, requires that the Court \nhave the power to review FISC rulings on motions for access to classified records. \nSecond, because this Court is a supervisory Article Til  court, it has authority \nto ensure that the FISC neither exceeds its jurisdictional remit nor fails to adjudicate \ncases within that remit. Even if this supervisory authority is not explicitly granted \nby statute,  it is a  longstanding function of the  writ of mandamus.  See Roche v. \nEvaporated Milk Ass 'n, 319 U.S. 21, 26 ( 1943) (\"The traditional use of the writ in \naid of appellate jurisdiction ... has been to confine an inferior court to a lawful \nexercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when \nit is its duty to do so.\"). \nFinally, review here would  serve the purposes  of mandamus review.  The \nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  importance  of mandamus  review  in  cases \ninvolving the balance ofj udicial and executive powers. See Cheney, 542 U.S. at 382. \nAnd federal courts of appeals have exercised their mandamus authority to consider \notherwise unreviewable petitions that pit \"important constitutional rights\" against \npressing issues of\"court administration. \" In re Globe Newspaper Co., 920 F.2d 88, \n90-91 (1st Cir. 1990); San Jose Mercury News, Inc. v. US. Dist. Ct., 187 F.3d I 096, \n1103 (9th Cir. 1999). This case involves both considerations. \n8 \n\nIV.  A ruling that the FISCR lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over \nMovant's petition would raise serious constitutional concerns. \nAppellate review is especially important because the FISC's holding raises at \nleast two serious constitutional questions. First, the FISC has interpreted FISA to \nstrip an Article III court of jurisdiction over claims invoking the court's Article III \nauthority to control its own records. As Professor Laura Donohue has explained, \nsuch a limitation violates the separation between the legislative and judicial powers. \nSee  Reply  Br.  of Amicus  Curiae  30-33,  In  re  Opinions,  No.  Misc.  13-08 \n(FISC Aug. 1, 20 18), https://perma.cc/9AJ6-66R7. \nSecond, the FISC's ruling might effectively deny Movant a forum in which to \nclaim a constitutional right of access to the FISC's and FISCR's opinions, which \nwould raise a \"serious constitutional question.\"  Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. at 603 \n(quoting Bowen v. Mich.  Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681, n.l2 \n(1986)). For reasons Movant has previously explained, it is not clear whether any \nother federal court can grant relief as  to Movant's First Amendment claim. See \nMovants'  Br.  12- 16,  In  re  Opinions, No.  Misc.  13-08,  https://perma.cc!UDY4-\nYD8B. This Court has suggested otherwise, see In re Opinions, 957 F.3d at 1355, \nbut it would be inconsistent with the FISC's inherent powers to require that claims \nfor  access to the FISC's opinions  be  brought  in  an entirely different court.  Cf \nFlynt v. Lombardi, 782 F.3d 963, 967 (8th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases holding that \nintervention, not filing a separate action, is the appropriate procedural vehicle for \n9 \n\nclaims seeking judicial records). In effect, then, the FISC's holding may foreclose \nthe only judicial forum capable of reviewing Movant's constitutional claim. \nForty years ago, the Supreme Court explained that when representatives of the \npress  and  general  public  assert  a  First  Amendment  right  of access  to  judicial \nproceedings, they \"must be given an opportunity to be heard on the question of their \nexclusion.\"  Globe Newspaper Co.  v.  Super.  Ct., 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25  (1982) \n(emphasis  added).  Appellate  courts  have  since  recognized  multiple  procedural \nmechanisms for non-parties to assert their constitutional access right and obtain \nappellate review. E.g.,  United States v. Are[,  533 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2008) (direct \nintervention); NY Times Co.,  828 F.2d at 113 (collateral-order doctrine); United \nStates v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d  1162,  1165-66 (9th Cir.  1982) (mandamus). Just as \nother appellate courts responded to  the Supreme Coutt's recognition of a public \naccess  right  by  identifying  mechanisms for  appellate  review,  this  Court  should \nensure there is a means for parties to seek review of FISC orders granting or denying \nan application for public access to its records. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should hold that it has authority to entertain Movant's appeal or \nMovant's petition for a writ of mandamus. Alternatively, the Court should certify \nthe jurisdictional questions raised herein to the Supreme Court. 50 U .S.C. § 1803(k). \n10 \n\nDated: October 30, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \nDavid A.

The FISC’s role was originally \nnarrow, but today, as a result of legislative changes \nand  new  technology,  the  court  evaluates  broad \nprograms  of  surveillance  that  can  have  profound \nimplications for Americans’ privacy, expressive, and \nassociational rights. The court’s opinions frequently \ninclude  significant  interpretations  of  statutory  and \nconstitutional law. Petitioner filed motions with the \nFISC asserting that the First Amendment provides a \nqualified  right  of  public  access  to  FISC  opinions \ncontaining significant legal analysis—even if portions \nof the published opinions must be redacted. The FISC \nrejected  one  of  these  motions  on  the  merits. \nSubsequently, in this case, the FISC and the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review (“FISCR”) \nboth held that they lack jurisdiction even to rule on \nPetitioner’s constitutional claim. \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether the FISC, like other Article III courts, \nhas jurisdiction to consider a motion asserting that \nthe First Amendment provides a qualified public right \nof  access  to  the  court’s  significant  opinions,  and \nwhether the FISCR has jurisdiction to consider an \nappeal from the denial of such a motion. \n2.  Whether  the  First  Amendment  provides  a \nqualified  right  of  public  access  to  the  FISC’s \nsignificant opinions. \ni \n\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner is the American Civil Liberties Union, \nInc.  (“ACLU”).  The  ACLU  was  the  movant  in  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  and  the \npetitioner  in  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance \nCourt of Review. \nWith respect to the petition for a writ of certiorari \nor common-law certiorari, Respondent is the United \nStates, which opposed Petitioner’s motion and petition \nbelow. \nIn  the  alternative,  should  the  Court  treat  the \npetition as one for a writ of mandamus, see infra Part \nIII.B,  Petitioner  seeks  a  writ  to  the  U.S.  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court and the U.S. Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Court  of  Review,  which \ndenied Petitioner’s motion and petition below.  \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT \nThe ACLU is a non-profit corporation. It has no \nparent corporations and does not issue stock. \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS  \nThere are no directly related proceedings. \n \n   \nii \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nOpinions below ............................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction ................................................................. 1 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ..... 1 \nStatement of the case ................................................. 1 \nReasons for granting the petition .............................. 9 \nI.

The  opinion  of  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance  Court  of  Review  (App.  1a)  is  not \npublished in the Federal Reporter but is available at \n2020 WL 6888073. \nJURISDICTION \nThe  Court  has  statutory  jurisdiction  under  28 \nU.S.C. § 1254(1) and 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b). See infra \nPart  III.A.  In  the  alternative,  the  Court  has \njurisdiction over this petition as a petition for a writ \nof  mandamus  or  common-law  certiorari  under  28 \nU.S.C. § 1651. See infra Part III.B. \nThe FISCR entered the judgment under review on \nNovember 19, 2020. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe  First  Amendment  provides  that  “Congress \nshall  make  no  law  respecting  an  establishment  of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \nabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \nright  of  the  people  peaceably  to  assemble,  and  to \npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.” \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nStatutory Background \nIn  1975,  Congress  established  a  committee, \nchaired  by  Senator  Frank  Church,  to  investigate \nallegations  of  “substantial  wrongdoing”  by  federal \nintelligence agencies conducting surveillance. Final \n1 \n \n\nReport of the S. Select Comm. to Study Governmental \nOperations  with  Respect  to  Intelligence  Activities \n(Book II), S. Rep. No. 94-755, at v (1976) (“Church \nCommittee Report”). The committee discovered that, \nover  four  decades,  the  intelligence  agencies  had \n“violated  specific statutory  prohibitions,”  “infringed \nthe constitutional rights of American citizens,” and \n“intentionally  disregarded”  legal  limitations  on \nsurveillance in the name of “national security.” Id. at \n137.  \nLargely  in  response  to  the  Church  Committee \nReport,  Congress  enacted  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA”), Pub. L. No. 95-511, \n92 Stat. 1783 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.). The \nstatute created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (“FISC”) and empowered it to grant or deny \ngovernment  applications  for  electronic  surveillance \norders in foreign intelligence investigations. See 50 \nU.S.C. § 1803(a). The statute also created the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review (“FISCR”) \nto hear appeals from the FISC’s rulings. Today the \nFISC comprises eleven federal district court judges, \nand  the  FISCR  comprises  three  additional  federal \ncourt judges. 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)–(b).  \nAs originally enacted, FISA generally required the \ngovernment to obtain an individualized order from the \nFISC before conducting “electronic surveillance” on \nU.S. soil. Id. §§ 1804(a), 1805. The FISC could issue \nan order authorizing such surveillance only if there \nwas “probable cause to believe that the target of the \nelectronic surveillance [was] a foreign power or an \nagent of a foreign power.” Id. § 1805(a)(2)(A). The role \nthat FISC judges played in the first years after the \ncourt’s creation was analogous to the role that federal \ndistrict  court  judges  play  in  granting  or  denying \n2 \n \n\nwiretap applications under Title III of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  \nOver time, however, the FISC’s role has changed \nfundamentally—due to both Congress’s expansion of \nFISA and the exponential growth in the capabilities of \npowerful surveillance technologies. After the terrorist \nattacks of September 2001, the FISC interpreted some \nprovisions of FISA to permit it to authorize sweeping \nsurveillance  programs  that  entailed  the  mass \ncollection  of  sensitive  records  about  millions  of \nAmericans’ expressive and associational activities, as \ndiscussed  further  below.1  In  addition,  Congress \namended  FISA  in  2008  to  authorize  the  FISC  to \napprove broad programs of surveillance that, while \ntargeted  at  foreign  nationals  abroad,  include  the \nwarrantless acquisition of Americans’ international \ncommunications  from  facilities  inside  the  United \nStates. See FISA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. \n110-261, 122 Stat. 2436 (“FAA”). Under the authority \ngranted  by  the  FAA,  the  FISC’s  role  consists \nprincipally  of  reviewing,  on  an  annual  basis,  the \ngeneral procedures the government proposes to use in \ncarrying out its surveillance—in particular, “targeting \nprocedures” and “minimization procedures.” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a(j).  This  is  a  momentous  shift,  as  “[r]ather \nthan  approving  or  denying  individual  targeting \nrequests, the FISA court authorizes the surveillance \nprogram as a whole . . . .” Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Bd., Report on the Surveillance Program \nOperated  Pursuant  to  Section  702  at  106  (2014), \nhttps://perma.cc/WD5R-5GKE. \n \n1 For ease of reference, Petitioner uses the term “Americans” \nto refer to citizens and residents of the United States. \n3 \n \n\nToday,  the  court  writes  opinions  that  include \nsignificant  interpretations  of  FISA,  other  federal \nstatutes,  and  the  Constitution.  These  opinions \nsometimes authorize broad surveillance regimes, with \nfar-reaching  implications  for  U.S.  citizens  and \nresidents who are not the ostensible targets of the \ngovernment’s surveillance. For example, in 2006 the \nFISC authorized the government to collect metadata \nrelating to most phone calls made or received in the \nUnited States—billions of phone records relating to \nmillions  of  Americans—and  in  2013  it  wrote  an \nopinion  analyzing  the  lawfulness  of  this  program \nunder FISA and the Fourth Amendment. In 2011 the \nFISC issued a lengthy opinion assessing the legality \nof the government’s practice of scanning Americans’ \ninternational communications for certain terms that \nthe  government  believes  are  associated  with  its \nforeign-intelligence  targets.  [Redacted],  2011  WL \n10945618 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011), https://perma.cc/L4YQ-\nK2MB. And in 2018 the FISC issued an opinion on the \ngovernment’s querying of databases of international \ncommunications  obtained  without  a  warrant  for \ninformation  about  Americans.  [Redacted],  402  F. \nSupp. 3d 45 (FISC 2018). \nPublic Access to the FISC’s Opinions \nAlthough the FISC is an inferior court established \nby Congress under Article III, see App. 67a n.17 (citing \nIn re Certification of Questions of Law to FISCR, No. \n18-01,  2018  WL  2709456,  at  *4  (FISCR  Mar.  16, \n2018)), and although, as noted above, it sometimes \nresolves issues of immense importance to the public, \nthe FISC’s proceedings are held behind closed doors, \nand  the  court  does  not  customarily  publish  its \ndecisions.  Between  1978  and  2013,  the  FISC \npublished only two of its opinions. App. 119a; In re \n4 \n \n\nMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \n484  (FISC  2007).  The  FISC  and  the  government \nreleased  additional  FISC  opinions  after  media \norganizations published FISC materials provided by \nEdward Snowden, a former government contractor. \nApp. 114a–116a.  \nIn 2015, as part of the USA Freedom Act, Congress \nrequired the government to conduct a declassification \nreview  of  opinions  that  “include[]  a  significant \nconstruction or interpretation of any provision of law” \nand to make those opinions available to the public “to \nthe greatest extent practicable.” 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a). \nThis declassification review, however, is conducted by \nthe executive branch, not the court; does not apply to \nopinions  issued  before  the  USA  Freedom  Act  was \nenacted, according to the executive branch, see infra \nnote 3; is subject to a national security waiver, see 50 \nU.S.C. § 1872(c); and does not involve application of \nthe standard the courts have ordinarily applied to \npublic access claims for court records. \nPrior Related Proceedings \nIn motions filed over a period of almost a decade, \nPetitioner  ACLU  asked  the  FISC  to  recognize  a \nqualified  First  Amendment  right  of  access  to  its \nsignificant  legal  opinions,  including  opinions \ncontaining  “significant  constructions  or \ninterpretations  of  any  provision  of  law.”  50  U.S.C. \n§ 1872(a).  Invoking  the  framework  set  out  by  this \nCourt in Press–Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. (Press–\nEnterprise II), 478 U.S. 1 (1986), and related cases, \nPetitioner argued that a right of access should apply \nbecause  (1)  judicial  opinions  interpreting \nconstitutional and statutory limits on governmental \nauthorities—including  those  relevant  to  foreign-\n5 \n \n\nintelligence  surveillance—have  historically  been \navailable  for  inspection  by  the  public,  and  (2) \ndisclosure would educate the public about government \nactivity that affects individual rights, ensure a more \ninformed public debate about the reach of government \nsurveillance, increase the perceived legitimacy of the \nFISC and the surveillance it authorizes, and allow \nother courts to engage with the FISC’s rulings, to the \nbenefit of those courts as well as the FISC.  \nThe FISC rejected some of Petitioner’s motions on \nthe merits and others on jurisdictional grounds. One \nof those motions, in particular, produced rulings that \nare an essential backdrop to this Petition. \nIn  November  2013,  soon  after  the  government \nacknowledged  that  the  FISC  had  authorized  bulk \ncollection  of  Americans’  telephony  metadata,2 \nPetitioner  moved  the  FISC  to  publish  its  opinions \nrelating to any collection of data in bulk. Motion of \nACLU,  ACLU  of  the  Nation’s  Capital  &  Media \nFreedom  and  Information  Access  Clinic  for  the \nRelease of Court Records, No. 13-08 (FISC Nov. 7, \n2013)  (“November  2013  Motion”).  In  2020,  Judge \nCollyer held that the FISC had ancillary jurisdiction \nover  Petitioner’s  motion  because  exercising  such \njurisdiction was “necessary to [the court’s] successful \nfunctioning,” and in particular to its ability to “ensure \nthat  its  proceedings  comport  with  a  correct \nunderstanding  of  both  the  First  Amendment  and \nstatutorily required security procedures.” App. 97a, \n100a. \n \n2  Ellen  Nakashima  &  Sari  Horwitz,  Newly  Declassified \nDocuments on Phone Records Program Released, Wash. Post, \nJuly 31, 2013, https://wapo.st/2R1ZeXy. \n6 \n \n\nJudge  Collyer  rejected  Petitioner’s  First \nAmendment  argument  on  the  merits,  however, \nreasoning that neither “history” nor “logic” supported \na qualified right of access to the FISC’s significant \nopinions. App. 103a–127a.  \nPetitioner filed a “Petition for Review, or, in the \nalternative, for a Writ of Mandamus” with the FISCR. \nThe  FISCR  dismissed  the  petition  for  lack  of \njurisdiction, reasoning that it did not “fall[] within the \nclass  of  cases  carefully  delineated  by  the  FISA  as \nwithin [the FISCR’s] authority as a court of appellate \nreview.”  App.  69a.  The  court  rejected  Petitioner’s \nargument  that  FISA  supplied  the  FISCR  with \njurisdiction by giving the court authority to “review \nthe  denial  of  any  application  [made]  under  this \nchapter,” App. 74a (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b)).  \nThe court also rejected Petitioner’s argument that \nit  should  exercise  ancillary  jurisdiction  over  the \npetition. The court reasoned that Petitioner had not \nbeen  haled  into  court  against  its  will,  and  that \nresolution of the petition was not necessary to enforce \nthe court’s mandates or to protect the integrity of its \nproceedings.  The  court  also  rejected  Petitioner’s \nrequest for a writ of mandamus, reasoning that the \nwrit is available only to “assist an existing basis for \njurisdiction,” and that Petitioner had not identified an \n“independent  basis  for  subject  matter  jurisdiction” \nover its petition.” App. 86a.  \nThe Right-of-Access Motion at Issue Here \nThis Petition arises from a motion Petitioner filed \nwith the FISC in October 2016, seeking “opinions and \norders containing novel or significant interpretations \nof law issued between September 11, 2001, and the \npassage of the USA FREEDOM Act” (“October 2016 \n7 \n \n\nMotion”). App. 8a. These opinions and orders address, \namong other matters, the lawfulness of bulk email \nsearches,  the  government’s  authority  to \nsurreptitiously  install  malware  on  Americans’ \ncomputers,  and  the  use  of  warrantless  internet \nsurveillance  for  cybersecurity  purposes.  App.  9a. \nAlthough the FISC’s rulings on these matters may \nhave broad implications for the rights of Americans, \nthe public has been entirely deprived of access to them \nwithout any judicial determination that such secrecy \nis justified.3  \nPetitioner argued that judicial opinions relating to \nforeign-intelligence surveillance had historically been \nopen  to  the  public;  that  lower  courts  routinely \npublished opinions about the scope and lawfulness of \nsurveillance  under  FISA;  that  Congress  had \nrecognized  that  some  FISC  opinions  should  be \npublished; and that many FISC opinions had been \npublished  since  2013.  App.  14a–15a,  23a–25a. \nPetitioner also argued that recognition of a qualified \nright of access would play a significant positive role \nand would not compromise the operation of the FISC \nor the government’s legitimate interest in protecting \nthe confidentiality of properly classified information, \nbecause  the  right  of  access  would  extend  only  to \ninformation  that  could  be  disclosed  without \nundermining national security. App. 29a–33a. \nIn  September  2020,  FISC  Judge  Boasberg \ndismissed  the  motion,  concluding  that  exercising \n \n3 The government takes the position that 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a) \ndoes not require it to declassify FISC opinions predating the \npassage of the USA Freedom Act. See Gov’t Mem., Elec. Frontier \nFound. v. DOJ, No. 14-cv-00760 (D.D.C. Feb. 5, 2016), ECF No. \n28. \n8 \n \n\njurisdiction would be “inconsistent” with the decision \nthe FISCR had issued five months earlier in relation \nto Petitioner’s November 2013 Motion. App. 4a. The \nFISCR then dismissed Petitioner’s request for review, \nholding  that  it,  too,  lacked  jurisdiction.  App  1a. \nPetitioner asked the court to certify the jurisdictional \nquestion to this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2), but \nthe FISCR declined. App. 2a–3a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nFor  centuries,  the  public  has  enjoyed  access  to \njudicial  proceedings  to  promote  transparency, \naccountability,  and  democratic  participation  and \noversight. And for more than forty years, this Court \nhas  recognized  a  right  of  access  rooted  in  the \nConstitution,  holding  that  the  First  Amendment \nguarantees public access to judicial proceedings “so as \nto  give  meaning  to”  its  “explicit  guarantees”  of \nfreedom  of  speech  and  of  the  press.  Richmond \nNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 575 (1980). \nThe FISC’s and FISCR’s denial of even a forum to \nassert  such  a  right  cannot  be  reconciled  with  this \ntradition, or with the universal understanding that \nevery court controls access to its own records. \nI.  The questions presented by this case are \nextraordinarily important, and there is \nno possibility of further percolation. \nWhether there is a constitutional right of access to \nsignificant  legal  opinions  issued  by  the  FISC,  and \nwhether there is any forum in which to assert such a \nright, are questions of exceptional importance.  \nThe  decisions  of  the  FISC  affect  the  privacy, \nexpressive,  and  associational  rights  of  every \n9 \n \n\nAmerican.  The  FISC’s  opinions  often  involve  the \ninterpretation  of  the  Constitution  and  federal \nsurveillance  laws  on  issues  of  broad  public \nsignificance. Over the last twenty years, the FISC has \nbeen asked to approve broad programs of surveillance \nin  tension  with  the  public  understanding  of  the \nstatutes at issue. See, e.g., ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d \n787, 818 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding call-records program \nunlawful  and  rejecting  FISC’s  previously  secret \nstatutory interpretation as a “drastic expansion” that \n“swe[pt] further than [other national security-related] \nstatutes ha[d] ever been thought to reach”). \nPublic access to these opinions is critical to the \nlegitimacy of the FISC and FISCR, to the legitimacy \nof the government’s surveillance activities, and to the \ndemocratic process. As explained below, access would \nallow  the  public  to  understand  the  government’s \nsurveillance powers and practices, promote confidence \nin the FISA system, strengthen democratic oversight, \nand improve judicial decision-making. See Part II.B.2. \nTransparency  would  also  give  Americans,  and \nCongress, the opportunity to press for reforms. While \nnational  security  concerns  may  sometimes  require \nredaction,  the  First  Amendment  right  of  access  is \n“qualified” precisely to permit such exceptions where \njustified. \nDespite  the  importance  of  public  access  to  the \nFISC’s  proceedings,  the  FISCR  and  FISC  have \nforeclosed any consideration of this question, thereby \ndenying  the  public  “any  judicial  forum  for  [the \nassertion of] a colorable constitutional claim,” which \nitself  raises  a  “serious  constitutional  question.” \nWebster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988). The FISC’s \nand FISCR’s rulings were wrong, and only this Court \ncan correct them. \n10 \n \n\nFurther,  the  FISC  and  FISCR  are  courts  of \nspecialized jurisdiction, so there can be no split among \nthe circuits or further percolation on either of the \nissues the Petition presents. Indeed, the courts below \nhave categorically precluded any further development \nof the law by ruling that they lack jurisdiction even to \nconsider the merits question.  \nII.  The FISC’s and FISCR’s rulings were \nincorrect. \nA. The FISC and FISCR have jurisdiction \nto hear right-of-access motions, and \ntheir holdings to the contrary are \ninconsistent with the decisions of \nother Article III courts. \nThe FISC and FISCR both erred in concluding that \nthey lack jurisdiction to consider whether the First \nAmendment affords a qualified right of public access \nto the FISC’s opinions.  \n1.  Other courts uniformly exercise \njurisdiction over claims for access \nto their records. \nThe  FISC’s  and  FISCR’s  jurisdictional  holdings \nconflict  with  the  jurisdictional  holdings  of  other \nArticle III courts, as well as other specialized federal \ncourts.  \nArticle  III  courts  routinely  exercise  jurisdiction \nover motions seeking access to their own records and \nproceedings. They do so in both criminal and civil \nproceedings—sometimes while the matter is ongoing \nand,  at  other  times,  long  after  the  matter  has \nconcluded. It is uniformly accepted that the court that \nconducted the proceedings, and has dominion over the \nrecords at issue, also has competence to rule on a \n11 \n \n\nmotion  for  access.  See,  e.g.,  Nixon  v.  Warner \nCommunications,  Inc.,  435  U.S.  589,  599  (1978) \n(“[T]he decision as to access is one best left to the \nsound  discretion  of  the  trial  court.”);  Flynt  v. \nLombardi,  782  F.3d  963,  966–67  (8th  Cir.  2015) \n(collecting cases holding that a motion to intervene, \nnot  a  separate  civil  action,  is  the  appropriate \nprocedural vehicle for access claims seeking judicial \nrecords); In re Globe Newspaper Co., 920 F.2d 88, 90 \n(1st Cir. 1990); In re Application of Nat’l Broad. Co., \n635 F.2d 945, 948–49 (2d Cir. 1980); United States v. \nCriden, 648 F.2d 814, 816 (3d Cir. 1981); Doe v. Pub. \nCitizen,  749  F.3d  246,  264  (4th  Cir.  2014);  United \nStates  v.  Chagra,  701  F.2d  354,  359–60  (5th  Cir. \n1983); United States v. Beckham, 789 F.2d 401, 404 \n(6th Cir. 1986); United States v. Corbitt, 879 F.2d 224, \n226–27 (7th Cir. 1989); United States v. Bus. of Custer \nBattlefield Museum & Stores, 658 F.3d 1188 (9th Cir. \n2011); United States v. Pickard, 733 F.3d 1297, 1300 \n(10th Cir. 2013); United States v. Valenti, 987 F.2d \n708, 711–12 (11th Cir. 1993); Wash. Post v. Robinson, \n935 F.2d 282, 283–84 (D.C. Cir. 1991); Uniloc 2017 \nLLC v. Apple, Inc., 964 F.3d 1351, 1355–56 (Fed. Cir. \n2020). \nThe FISC is a specialized federal court with limited \njurisdiction, but specialized courts have also exercised \njurisdiction over motions for access to their records \nand  proceedings.  For  instance,  bankruptcy  courts, \nwhich  are  established  under  Article  I  and  whose \npower is limited to cases arising under Title 11 of the \nU.S. Code, see 28 U.S.C. § 157, exercise jurisdiction \nover right-of-access motions brought by non-parties. \nSee, e.g., In re Alterra Healthcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66 \n(Bankr.  D.  Del.  2006)  (holding  that  the  court  had \njurisdiction  over  newspaper’s  challenge  to  sealing \n12 \n \n\norders because the motion was “a core proceeding over \nwhich  the  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(b) & 157(b)(2)(A)”); In \nre Bennett Funding Grp., Inc., 226 B.R. 331 (Bankr. \nN.D.N.Y.  1998);  In  re  Symington,  209  B.R.  678 \n(Bankr. D. Md. 1997); cf. Dacoron v. Brown, 4 Vet. App \n115,  119  (1993)  (“[N]othing  in  the  above  analysis \n[recognizing  district  court  jurisdiction  over \nconstitutional claims] implies that this Court does not \nhave  power  to  review  claims  pertaining  to  the \nconstitutionality  of  statutory  and  regulatory \nprovisions. Such authority is inherent in the Court’s \nstatus as a court of law, and is expressly provided in \n38 U.S.C. § 7261(a)(1) . . . .” (citations omitted)). \nThe FISC’s and FISCR’s rulings conflict with all of \nthe above decisions, which confirm the common-sense \nprinciple  that  a  federal  court  has  authority  to \ndetermine  the  extent  of  public  access  to  its  own \nproceedings.  \n2.  The decisions below were incorrect. \nThe FISC and FISCR were wrong to conclude that \nthey  lacked  jurisdiction  to  consider  Petitioner’s \nmotion.  Like  other  courts,  the  FISC  has  inherent \n“supervisory power” over its own records, and this \npower encompasses jurisdiction to consider claims for \naccess to those records. Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598. In \naddition, the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction supplies \nan independent basis for jurisdiction. Notably, before \nthe  FISC  concluded  that  it  lacked  jurisdiction  to \nconsider  right-of-access  motions,  it  exercised \njurisdiction over such motions on precisely these two \nbases. Compare App. 4a–6a, with, e.g., App. 93a–102a; \nIn re Orders Interpreting Section 215 of the Patriot \nAct, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064, at *5 (FISC \n13 \n \n\nSept. 13, 2013) (Saylor, J.); In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486–87, 497.  \nFirst,  like  all  Article  III  courts,  the  FISC  has \ninherent authority over its own records. All Article III \ncourts enjoy “certain implied powers [that] necessarily \nresult to our Courts of justice from the nature of their \ninstitution.” Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, \n43 (1991) (alteration removed) (quoting United States \nv. Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812)). These \ninherent powers are “governed not by rule or statute \nbut  by  the  control  necessarily  vested  in  courts  to \nmanage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly \nand expeditious disposition of cases.” Link v. Wabash \nR.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630–31 (1962).  \nThis inherent judicial authority encompasses the \n“supervisory power over [a court’s] own records and \nfiles.” Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598; see Gambale v. Deutsche \nBank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 140 (2d Cir. 2004) (same). \nPerhaps the most important judicial records are a \ncourt’s own opinions. The power to decide cases, and \nto issue opinions interpreting the law, lies at the very \ncore of the “judicial power” vested in Article III courts. \nYoung v. United States ex rel. Vuitton, 481 U.S. 787, \n816, 821 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring); Lowenschuss \nv. W. Publ’g Co., 542 F.2d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1976) \n(“[U]nder our system of jurisprudence the judiciary \nhas  the  duty  of  publishing  and  disseminating  its \ndecisions.” (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature \nof the Judicial Process 20, 21–22 (1963))).  \nThe power to control a court’s records necessarily \nincludes  jurisdiction  to  decide  claims  for  access  to \nthose records. See Pub. Citizen v. Liggett Grp., Inc., \n858  F.2d  775,  782  (1st  Cir.  1988)  (observing  that \n“courts  and  commentators  seem  unanimous”  in \n14 \n \n\nfinding  “an  inherent  power”  to  modify  protective \norders in response to motions for public access, even \nafter final judgment); Hagestad v. Tragesser, 49 F.3d \n1430, 1434 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n598); United Nuclear Corp. v. Cranford Ins. Co., 905 \nF.2d 1424, 1427 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. \n1073 (1991). As the FISC itself previously observed, \n“it  would  be  quite  odd  if  the  FISC  did  not  have \njurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim \nof right to the court’s very own records and files.” In re \nMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \nat 486–87. \nIndeed, Congress expressly recognized the FISC’s \n“inherent authority” as an Article III court in FISA, \n50 U.S.C. § 1803(h), and it provided that the FISC \n“may establish such rules and procedures, and take \nsuch  actions,  as  are  reasonably  necessary  to \nadminister [its] responsibilities under this chapter,” \nid. § 1803(g)(1). The FISC has exercised its inherent \nauthority  by  promulgating  rules  concerning  the \npublication of its opinions. FISC Rule of Procedure 62 \nprovides that “The Judge who authorized an order, \nopinion, or other decision may sua sponte or on motion \nby a party request that it be published.” The FISC’s \nand FISCR’s decisions below offer no explanation why \nthese courts would have inherent authority to publish \ntheir opinions sua sponte or on a motion filed by a \nparty to a FISC proceeding, but not on a motion filed \nby a third party such as Petitioner. Nothing about \nPetitioner’s status as a third party alters the FISC’s \ninherent authority over its own records.4  \n \n4 Courts routinely exercise jurisdiction over motions for public \naccess filed by non-parties, precisely because the original parties \n \n15 \n \n\nSecond,  ancillary  jurisdiction  provides  an \nindependent  basis  for  the  FISC  to  adjudicate \nPetitioner’s motion. See App. 93a–102a (Collyer, J.) \n(holding,  in  prior  proceeding,  that  the  FISC  had \nancillary jurisdiction over motion for public access to \nFISC  opinions).  A  court  may  exercise  ancillary \njurisdiction  over  a  claim  that  is  ancillary  to  and \ndependent on proceedings over which a court already \nhas jurisdiction, even if the ancillary claim “does not \nsatisfy  requirements  of  an  independent  basis  of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.” 13 Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3523 (3d ed. \n2021) (“Wright & Miller”) (emphasis in original).  \nCourts  have  exercised  ancillary  jurisdiction  for \n“two separate, though sometimes related, purposes”: \n(1) “to enable a court to function successfully, that is, \nto manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and \neffectuate its decrees”; or (2) “to permit disposition by \na single court of claims that are, in varying respects \nand degrees, factually interdependent.” Kokkonen v. \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 379–80 \n(1994). “Under this concept, a district court acquires \njurisdiction of a case or controversy in its entirety, \nand,  as  an  incident  to  the  full  disposition  of  the \nmatter,  may  hear  collateral  proceedings  when \nnecessary  to  allow  it  to  vindicate  its  role  as  a \ntribunal.” Wright & Miller § 3523.2. \nCourts  routinely  exercise  ancillary  jurisdiction \nover a broad range of proceedings related to functions \nat the core of the judicial power. In Kokkonen, for \n \nto a proceeding will typically already have access themselves and \nthus have little reason to assert a First Amendment right of \naccess. See, e.g., In re Globe Newspaper Co., 920 F.2d at 90; \nChagra, 701 F.2d at 359–60 (collecting cases). \n16 \n \n\nexample,  this  Court  recognized  that  a  court  may \nexercise  ancillary  jurisdiction  to  vindicate  its \ncontempt power. 511 U.S. at 379–80 (citing Hudson, \n11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 34); see also Cooter & Gell v. \nHartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395 (1990) (recognizing \nancillary  jurisdiction  over  proceedings  related  to \ncosts, attorneys’ fees, and sanctions).  \nHere, the FISC has ancillary jurisdiction because \nPetitioner’s motion seeks access to the FISC’s own \nopinions,  and  thus  is  ancillary  to  the  FISC \nproceedings that gave rise to those opinions. See, e.g., \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1803–1805.  \nMoreover, exercising ancillary jurisdiction would \nserve both of the “purposes” this Court recognized in \nKokkonen.  \nThe decision to publish or seal judicial records is \nnecessary  to  vindicate  the  court’s  own  authority. \nThus, in United States v. Hubbard, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that a court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction \nover  the  motion  of  a  third-party  intervenor  in  a \ncriminal  case  requesting  that  the  district  court \nmaintain certain documents under seal. 650 F.2d 293, \n307 (D.C. Cir. 1980); see also In re Sealed Case, 237 \nF.3d 657, 664 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same). If courts have \nancillary jurisdiction to hear third-party motions to \npreclude public access to judicial records, the same \njurisdiction  authorizes  them  to  hear  third-party \nmotions to grant public access. Access to a court’s \nrecords or proceedings is inextricably connected with \nthe court’s ability to conduct its day-to-day affairs. As \nthe FISC itself noted in an earlier ruling, “[w]hen a \nclaimant asserts [a] right of access with respect to the \nproceedings  or  documents  of  a  federal  court \nestablished under Article III, it is necessary for that \n17 \n \n\ncourt to be able to adjudicate the claim, lest its own \nactions violate the First Amendment.” App. 99a. \nAlso, no other court is positioned to rule with the \nsame knowledge of the underlying facts concerning \nmotions  for  public  access  to  FISC  materials.  See \nRichmond  Newspapers,  448  U.S.  at  560–61 \n(describing trial court’s order to clear the courtroom \nand  subsequent  hearing  to  address  the  parties’ \ninterests in closure); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior \nCt., 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982) (recognizing trial \ncourt’s  ability  to  ascertain  the  various  parties’ \ninterests in public access versus closure).  \nThe  FISC’s  expertise  in  foreign  intelligence \nsurveillance  means  that  it  is  especially  well-\npositioned  to  consider  which  portions  of  its  own \nopinions should remain secret—and which should not. \nSee, e.g., In re Orders Interpreting Section 215 of the \nPatriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, 2014 WL 5442058, at *2–\n*4 (FISC Aug. 7, 2014) (examining government claims \nthat FISC order should be withheld from the public in \ntoto). The FISC itself previously recognized that its \n“statutory obligation to maintain its records securely \nunderscores the need for it to be able to adjudicate” \nclaims for public access. App. 99a. The alternative \nwould  give  another  court  control  over  the  FISC’s \nrecords and would require that court to determine the \nconstitutionality of the FISC’s specialized rules and \nprocedures. App. 99a; In re Motion for Release of Court \nRecords, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486–87.  \nFor these reasons, Judge Collyer previously held \nthat the FISC had ancillary jurisdiction over a motion \nfor  access,  concluding  that  “[t]he  FISC’s  ability  to \n‘function successfully’ and ‘manage its proceedings,’ \nwould  be  significantly  compromised  if  it  lacked \n18 \n \n\nauthority to adjudicate First Amendment claims such \nas the one asserted by Movants.” App. 100a (quoting \nKokkonen,  511  U.S.  at  379–80).  That  ruling  was \ncorrect, and the contrary decisions of the FISC and \nFISCR are incorrect. \nIn rejecting Petitioner’s motion, the FISC held that \nexercising  inherent  or  ancillary  jurisdiction  was \ninappropriate  because  Petitioner  had  not  been \n“involuntarily  haled  into  court,”  did  not  have  a \npreexisting connection to the records sought, and did \nnot seek to assert rights “in an ongoing action.” App. \n6a (citing App. 83a). But none of these factors bars \njurisdiction over right-of-access claims. Motions for \naccess to court records are regularly filed by members \nof the public or the press who are not parties to the \noriginal proceeding and lack a preexisting connection \nto the records sought. See, e.g., Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n597–98  (“American  decisions  generally  do  not \ncondition enforcement of this right on a proprietary \ninterest in the document or upon a need for it as \nevidence  in  a  lawsuit.”).  Courts  routinely  exercise \njurisdiction over claims for their records even after \njudgment has been entered. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, 749 \nF.3d at 253 (directing district court to unseal records \nrequested  in  post-judgment  motion);  Gambale,  377 \nF.3d at 141 (“The court’s supervisory power does not \ndisappear  because  jurisdiction  over  the  relevant \ncontroversy has been lost. The records and files are \nnot in limbo.”). And the FISC’s proceedings are secret \nand  almost  never  publicly  docketed,  making  it \nvirtually impossible to seek intervention in an ongoing \nproceeding. \nThe  FISC  also  reasoned  that  the  “crux”  of \nPetitioner’s  claim  for  access  lay  “within  the \nExecutive’s  clear  authority  to  determine  what \n19 \n \n\nmaterial should remain classified,” App. 6a (quoting \nApp. 85a). Yet that is plainly a question for the merits, \nnot jurisdiction. See In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d \n383, 391–93 (4th Cir. 1985) (exercising jurisdiction \nover  right-of-access  claim  to  records  related  to \nproceedings  under  the  Classified  Information \nProcedures  Act).  Further,  as elaborated  below,  the \nmere  fact  that  an  opinion  contains  information \nclassified by the executive does not deprive the issuing \ncourt of its power over its own records.  \nThe FISC framed its refusal to exercise jurisdiction \nas  “respect  for  the  separation  of  powers,”  App.  6a \n(quoting  App.  85a),  but  this  is  exactly  backwards. \nWere Congress to deny a court power to adjudicate \nmotions for access to its own opinions, it would violate \nthe separation between the legislative and judicial \nbranches  by  interfering  with  the  court’s  inherent \nauthority to control its own records. Cf. Michaelson v. \nUnited States, 266 U.S. 42, 64–66 (1924); In re Stone, \n986  F.2d  898,  901–02  (5th  Cir.  1993).  Yet  this  is \nprecisely what the FISC has said that Congress did \nhere.  \nThe FISCR implied that Petitioner might be able \nto  file  a  motion  in  another  Article  III  court—for \nexample,  in  the  Southern  District  of  New  York—\nasserting a right of access to the FISC’s opinions. See \nApp. 74a n.41. But it is unlikely that any court other \nthan the FISC would exercise supervisory power over \nthe FISC’s records. Cf. Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598 (“Every \ncourt has supervisory power over its own records and \nfiles  . . . .”  (emphasis  added)).  Such  an  exercise  of \njurisdiction  would  disturb  ordinary  principles  of \ncomity  and  deference  among  courts  of  coordinate \njurisdiction,  and  it  would  practically  ensure \n20 \n \n\nduplicative litigation in multiple courts around the \ncountry over the FISC’s records.5  \nB. The First Amendment provides a right \nof access to significant FISC opinions. \nUnder  the  framework  set  out  by  this  Court  in \nPress–Enterprise II and related cases, a qualified First \nAmendment right of access applies to significant FISC \nopinions. First, there is a “history” of public access to \njudicial opinions, including to those that address the \nlawfulness of national security surveillance. Press–\nEnterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8–9. Second, recognizing a \nright of access here would play a “significant positive \nrole,” including with respect to the functioning of the \nFISC itself. Id. The prior FISC decision denying a \nFirst Amendment right of access on the merits was in \nerror. App. 103a–127a.6  \n \n5 For reasons similar to those discussed here and below, see \ninfra Part III.B, the FISCR had jurisdiction to review the FISC’s \njurisdictional holding. \n6  While  the  earlier  FISC  opinion  is  not  under  review, \nPetitioner  addresses  its  errors  here  because  the  FISC  has \ndefinitively decided the First Amendment question and because \nthat ruling is relevant to Petitioner’s claim on the merits. This \nCourt  has  discretion  to decide  the  jurisdictional  and  merits \nquestions together. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 743 \nn.23 (1982); House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 44–45 (1945), overruled \non other grounds, Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 251 \n(1998). \n21 \n \n\n1.  There is a history of public access \nto judicial opinions evaluating the \nlawfulness and constitutionality of \ngovernment conduct, including in \nthe national security context. \nBecause  transparency  of  the  judicial  process  is \ncentral to the rule of law, “[t]he policy of the state \nalways has been that the opinions of [judges], after \nthey  are  delivered,  belong  to  the  public.”  Nash  v. \nLathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 36 (1886) (cited by Banks v. \nManchester,  128  U.S.  244,  253–54  (1888)).  That \nprinciple applies equally in cases involving national \nsecurity. See, e.g., Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 \n(2006); United States v. U.S. Dist. Ct. (Keith), 407 U.S. \n297 (1972); N.Y. Times v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 \n(1971).  \nThere is accordingly a long history of federal courts \npublishing  their  opinions  in  cases  relating  to  the \nlegality  of  national  security  surveillance.  See,  e.g., \nKeith, 407 U.S. 297; Doe v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 861 (2d \nCir. 2008); Klayman v. Obama, 142 F. Supp. 3d 172 \n(D.D.C. 2015). Indeed, federal courts routinely publish \nopinions addressing the same issues that the FISC \naddresses in its opinions—the legality of surveillance \nconducted  under  FISA.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v. \nMoalin,  973  F.3d  977  (9th  Cir.  2020);  ACLU  v. \nClapper, 785 F.3d 787 (2d. Cir. 2015); United States v. \nDuggan, 743 F.2d 59, 72–74, 77 (2d Cir. 1984). \nIn asking whether there was a relevant history of \nopenness, the FISC erroneously limited its inquiry to \nwhether there was a tradition of access to the FISC’s \nown opinions. App. 112a. But as this Court has made \nclear,  whether  a  First  Amendment  right  of  access \nattaches does not turn on the historical practices of \nthe particular forum, El Vocero de P.R. v. Puerto Rico, \n22 \n \n\n508 U.S. 147, 149 (1993)—especially when that forum \nis of “relatively recent vintage,” In re Bos. Herald, Inc., \n321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st Cir. 2003). Approaching the \nquestion in this way renders the inquiry a tautology; \nby definition, new forums will never have a history of \naccess. \nThe relevant question is not whether the public \nhas  historically  had  access  to  FISC  opinions,  but \nwhether  it  has  had  access  to  analogous  opinions \nissued by other Article III courts. See El Vocero, 508 \nU.S. at 149; In re Bos. Herald, 321 F.3d at 184 (looking \nto how “analogous” courts have treated “documents of \nthe same type or kind” (quotation marks omitted)); \nHartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 94 (2d \nCir.  2004)  (examining  First  Amendment  right  of \naccess  to  court  “docket  sheets  and  their  historical \ncounterparts,” beginning with early English courts). \nAs the cases cited above demonstrate, the answer to \nthat question is clear. \n2.  Recognizing a qualified right of \naccess would “play a significant \npositive role.” \nThe second prong of the Press–Enterprise II test is \nalso satisfied here, because a qualified right of access \nwould play a significant positive role, including with \nrespect to the functioning of the FISC. \nFirst, a qualified right of access would help the \npublic  better  understand  the  nature,  scope,  and \nimport of the government’s surveillance activities. As \nnoted  above,  the  FISC  is  frequently  called  on  to \naddress questions that have far-reaching implications \nfor Americans’ expressive, associational, and privacy \nrights.  A  qualified  right  of  access  to  the  FISC’s \nopinions would allow the public to understand the \n23 \n \n\nauthorities Congress has granted to the intelligence \nagencies,  how  those  authorities  have  been \ninterpreted,  and  what  implications  these  activities \nhave for their constitutional rights.  \nSecond, a qualified right of access would promote \npublic confidence in the integrity of the FISA system. \n“People in an open society do not demand infallibility \nfrom their institutions, but it is difficult for them to \naccept  what  they  are  prohibited  from  observing.” \nPress–Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13 (quotation marks \nomitted); see also Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606 \n(public  access  to  court  documents  and  proceedings \n“fosters  an  appearance  of  fairness,  thereby \nheightening public respect for the judicial process”). \nFISC  judges  have  themselves  acknowledged  this \ndynamic and pressed for disclosure of certain FISC \nopinions  to  better  inform  debate.  See,  e.g.,  Ellen \nNakashima & Carol D. Leonnig, Effort Underway to \nDeclassify  Document  that  Is  Legal  Foundation  for \nNSA  Phone  Program,  Wash.  Post,  Oct.  12,  2013, \nhttps://wapo.st/3dhLXS4  (reporting  that  “several \nmembers  of  the  intelligence  court  want  more \ntransparency about the court’s role to dispel what they \nconsider a misperception that the court acted as a \nrubber stamp”). \nThird, a qualified right of access would strengthen \ndemocratic oversight. In the past, unnecessary secrecy \nrelating to FISC opinions has frustrated congressional \noversight.  See,  e.g.,  Letter  from  Sens.  Dianne \nFeinstein, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden & Mark Udall to \nHon.  John  Bates,  Presiding  Judge,  FISC  (Feb.  13, \n2013), https://perma.cc/H3Q5-CGNZ (calling on FISC \nto declassify certain opinions containing “significant \ninterpretations of law” to inform congressional debate \nabout surveillance authorities scheduled to sunset); In \n24 \n \n\nre Orders Interpreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, \n2013  WL  5460064,  at  *7  (“Congressional  amici \nemphasize the value of public information and debate \nin  representing  their  constituents  and  discharging \ntheir legislative responsibilities.”).  \nIn  some  instances,  secrecy  has  allowed  the \ngovernment’s  surveillance  policies  to  become \nunmoored from the democratic consent essential to \ntheir  legitimacy.  See,  e.g.,  ACLU,  785  F.3d  787 \n(holding  call-records  program  to  be  unlawful). \nTransparency gives citizens the opportunity to press \nfor reforms, and gives Congress the opportunity to \nconsider those reforms with public input. See, e.g., \nUSA Freedom Act, Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 \n(2015) (after unprecedented disclosures by FISC and \nexecutive branch, narrowing certain FISA authorities \nand providing for new procedural safeguards). \nFourth, transparency would aid judicial decision-\nmaking.  Since  public  attention  focused  on  FISA \nsurveillance and the FISC’s rulings beginning in June \n2013,  there  has  been  a  proliferation  of  highly \nsophisticated legal and technical debates about the \nFISC’s opinions and the surveillance they authorize. \nIn  camera  decision-making  precludes  meaningful \nengagement  by  experts  from  different  fields  or \nsustained development of competing viewpoints.  \nFifth, a qualified right of public access would afford \nother federal courts the benefit of the FISC’s expertise \nand  analysis.  This  iterative  process  lies  at  the \nfoundation  of  our  legal  system.  See,  e.g.,  Penny  v. \nLittle, 4 Ill. (3 Scam.) 301, 304 (1841) (“The common \nlaw is a beautiful system; containing the wisdom and \nexperience of ages.”). Yet it has been stunted by the \nwithholding of the FISC’s significant legal opinions.  \n25 \n \n\nIn its prior opinion, the FISC concluded that the \nbenefits of a qualified right of access here would be \noutweighed by the risk of inadvertent disclosure. App. \n124a–126a.  That  risk,  however,  does  not  supply  a \npersuasive reason against recognition of a qualified \nright of access. The FISC’s own recent practice shows \nthat the court can publish its opinions in a manner \nthat safeguards properly classified information. Over \nthe past eight years, the FISC has published more \nthan  fifty  opinions  with  redactions  to  protect \ngovernment secrets. App. 117a–119a (listing opinions \nand circumstances of publication). Neither the FISC \nnor  the  government  has  suggested  that  the \npublication  of  these  opinions  undermined  national \nsecurity. That other federal courts commonly publish \nopinions  relating  to  sensitive  national  security \nmatters—with redactions, where necessary, see, e.g., \nN.Y. Times v. DOJ, 806 F.3d 682 (2d Cir. 2015)—\nunderscores the point.7 \nTo the extent the FISC’s reasoning was based on \nthe  view  that  Article  III  courts  lack  authority  to \noverturn  the  government’s  classification  decisions, \n \n7 The FISC’s recent practice demonstrates the value of judicial \nreview in this context. When Petitioner moved for disclosure of \nopinions relating to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, for \nexample,  the  government  initially  contended  that  national \nsecurity required the opinions to be withheld from the public in \ntheir entirety. See In re Orders Interpreting Section 215 of the \nPatriot Act, 2014 WL 5442058, at *2–*3. After FISC Judge Saylor \nquestioned  this  contention,  the  government  agreed  that  the \nopinions could be published with redactions. When Judge Saylor \npressed  the  government  again,  the  government  agreed  that \nmany of the redactions were unnecessary. While Judge Saylor \ndid not apply the Press–Enterprise II test, he found that the \nremaining redactions would be justifiable under that test if the \ntest applied. See id. at *4. \n26 \n \n\nApp.  123a–124a,  it  inappropriately  conflated  the \nquestion of classification with the question of whether \ncourt opinions can constitutionally be withheld from \nthe public. Article III courts cannot leave the latter \nquestion  to  the  executive  branch  alone.  To  the \ncontrary, courts have a constitutional duty to decide \nthis constitutional question for themselves. See, e.g., \nBismullah v. Gates, 501 F.3d 178, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2007) \n(“It  is  the  court,  not  the  Government,  that  has \ndiscretion to seal a judicial record.”), vacated on other \ngrounds,  554  U.S.  913  (2008);  United  States  v. \nMoussaoui, 65 F. App’x 881, 887 (4th Cir. 2003)). \nIII.  This Court has jurisdiction to correct the \nFISC’s and FISCR’s errors. \nThis Court has jurisdiction over the Petition under \nits statutory certiorari jurisdiction or its authority to \nentertain extraordinary writs. \nA. The Court has jurisdiction to issue a \nstatutory writ of certiorari under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1254(1) and 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b). \nThe Court has jurisdiction to issue a statutory writ \nof certiorari under both 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1) and 50 \nU.S.C. § 1803(b).  \n1.  28 U.S.C. § 1254(1) \nSection  1254(1)  provides  that  this  Court  may \nreview  by  writ  of  certiorari  cases  “in  the  court  of \nappeals.” The FISCR is a “court of appeals” within the \nmeaning of section 1254(1) because it is an Article III \ncourt that sits in review of decisions made by the \nFISC, also an Article III court. See In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486; In re \nSealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731 (FISCR 2002); see also \nFISCR  Rule  4  (“The  FISCR  is  an  appellate  court \n27 \n \n\nestablished by act of Congress.”); FISCR Rule 6(b) \n(referring  to  the  FISCR  as  a  “Court  of  Appeals”); \nFISCR Rule 8 (“All writs that may be issued by United \nStates  courts  of  appeals  shall  be  available  to  the \nFISCR.”). \nThe  FISCR  has  cited  50  U.S.C.  § 1803(k)  in \nsupport of the proposition that it is not a “court of \nappeals.” App. 81a n.64. But that provision of FISA, \nwhich states that the FISCR “shall be considered to be \na court of appeals” for purposes of section 1254(2), \nmerely clarifies that the FISCR may certify questions \nof law to this Court pursuant to section 1254(2). It \ndoes not purport to strip this Court of the statutory \njurisdiction generally granted in section 1254(1). And \nthis Court “normally do[es] not read statutory silence \nas  implicitly  modifying  or  limiting  Supreme  Court \njurisdiction that another statute specifically grants.” \nHertz  Corp.  v.  Friend,  559  U.S.  77,  83  (2010) \n(emphasis added). \n2.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(b) \nSection 1803(b) of FISA provides an independent \nbasis  for  this  Court  to  issue  a  statutory  writ  of \ncertiorari.  The  provision  vests  the  FISCR  with \njurisdiction to review “the denial of any application \nmade under this chapter,” and it states that, if the \nFISCR “determines that the application was properly \ndenied,” the Supreme Court “shall have jurisdiction to \nreview such decision.” Petitioner’s motion for access to \nthe FISC’s legal opinions is plainly “any application.” \nSee Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 \n(2008) (in a statute, the word “any” has “expansive” \nsweep).  And  Petitioner’s  motion  arises  “under  this \nchapter,” because it seeks access to opinions issued by \n28 \n \n\nthe FISC pursuant to authority granted by FISA, 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801 et seq.  \nB. Alternatively, this Court has \njurisdiction to issue a writ of \nmandamus or a writ of common-law \ncertiorari. \nIn the alternative, Petitioner respectfully requests \nthat this Court treat the Petition as one for a writ of \nmandamus or common-law certiorari pursuant to the \nAll Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. To justify issuance of \neither writ, “the petition must show that the writ will \nbe in aid of the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, that \nexceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the \nCourt’s discretionary powers, and that adequate relief \ncannot be obtained in any other form or from any other \ncourt.” S. Ct. Rule 20.1.  \n1.  Issuance of a writ of mandamus or \ncommon-law certiorari would be in \naid of this Court’s appellate \njurisdiction. \nIssuance of an extraordinary writ would be in aid \nof  this  Court’s  appellate  jurisdiction  for  four \nindependent reasons. \nFirst, issuance of an extraordinary writ would be \nin aid of this Court’s inherent jurisdiction to review a \nlower court’s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. As the \nCourt noted in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, “[t]here can be no \nserious doubt concerning our power to review a court \nof appeals’ decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction—\na power we have exercised routinely.” 457 U.S. at 743 \nn.23. If the Court lacked jurisdiction over petitions \nlike  this  one,  “decisions  to  dismiss  for  want  of \njurisdiction would be insulated entirely from review \nby this Court.” Id.; see also Hohn, 524 U.S. at 247. \n29 \n \n\n“The traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate \njurisdiction . . . has been to confine an inferior court to \na lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to \ncompel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to \ndo so.” Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass’n, 319 U.S. 21, \n26 (1943) (emphasis added). \n Second, issuance of an extraordinary writ would \nbe  in  aid  of  this  Court’s  constitutional  appellate \njurisdiction. Because the FISC and the FISCR are \ninferior Article III tribunals, see supra Part II.A.2, \ntheir decisions are within this Court’s constitutional \nappellate jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. \n2.  This  jurisdiction  obtains  even  where  no  statute \nprovides jurisdiction, because this Court’s appellate \njurisdiction—unlike  that  of  the  inferior  courts—\nderives  from  the  Constitution  itself.  See  James  E. \nPfander,  Jurisdiction-Stripping  and  the  Supreme \nCourt’s Power to Supervise Inferior Tribunals, 78 Tex. \nL. Rev. 1433, 1494–98 (2000); Richard F. Wolfson, \nExtraordinary Writs in the Supreme Court Since Ex \nparte Peru, 51 Colum. L. Rev. 977, 991 (1951) (In Ex \nparte  Peru,  “the  Court  found  that,  with respect  to \ncases coming from the federal courts, its power [under \nthe All Writs Act] was practically limitless.”). \nThird, issuance of an extraordinary writ would be \nin aid of this Court’s inherent jurisdiction over claims \nof  access  to  records  of  the  judiciary.  As  explained \nabove,  see  supra  Part  II.A,  “[e]very  court  has \nsupervisory  power  over  its  own  records  and  files.” \nNixon,  435  U.S.  at  598;  see  also  In  re  Motion  for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486–87 \n(earlier FISC opinion recognizing “inherent power[]” \nover its records). As the ultimate repository of the \njudicial power, this Court necessarily has jurisdiction \nto review the exercise of, or the refusal to exercise, \n30 \n \n\nlower courts’ supervisory power of their records and \nfiles. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 196 \n(2010) (“This Court also has a significant interest in \nsupervising  the  administration  of  the  judicial \nsystem.”); cf. S. Ct. Rule 10(a) (the Court will consider \nwhether the courts below have “so far departed from \nthe accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings \n. . . as to call for an exercise of this Court’s supervisory \npower”). \nFinally, issuance of an extraordinary writ would be \nin aid of this Court’s jurisdiction—under the First \nAmendment itself—to review the denial of a claimed \nright of access to Article III proceedings. Forty years \nago, this Court held that the press and public “must \nbe given an opportunity to be heard” in challenging \nany limitation on public access to court proceedings. \nGlobe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 609 n.25. Yet the courts \nbelow have closed the door to all such claims at the \nthreshold.  Only  this  Court  can  ensure  that  the \nopportunity guaranteed in Globe Newspaper Co. is \nafforded here.  \nEach of these independent bases for jurisdiction \nsupports the Court’s review not only of the FISCR’s \nand the FISC’s jurisdictional rulings, but of the merits \nof Petitioner’s substantive claim as well. See Nixon, \n457  U.S.  at  743  n.23;  Mayo,  324  U.S.  at  44–45, \noverruled on other grounds, Hohn, 524 U.S. at 251. \n2.  Exceptional circumstances warrant \nissuance of a writ of mandamus or \ncommon-law certiorari. \nExceptional circumstances warrant the issuance of \nan extraordinary writ. This case asks whether the \npublic  has  a  First  Amendment  right  of  access  to \nsignificant opinions of law issued by an Article III \n31 \n \n\ncourt  that  directly  affect  their  privacy  and \nassociational rights. The FISC and the FISCR have \nheld that they cannot even consider such a claim. This \ncategorical  holding  cannot  be  squared  with  the \nunbroken  tradition  of  public  access  to  judicial \nopinions, or with the logic in upholding a qualified \nentitlement to legal opinions concerning the nation’s \nsurveillance laws. \n3.  Adequate relief is unavailable in \nany other form or from any other \ncourt. \nIf the Court determines that statutory certiorari is \nunavailable, then “adequate relief cannot be obtained \nin any other form or from any other court.” S. Ct. Rule \n20.1. As explained above, see supra Part II, the effect \nof the FISCR’s and the FISC’s rulings is to shut the \ncourthouse doors on claims of public access, no matter \nhow  meritorious,  and  even  where  there  are  no \nlegitimate  national  security  concerns  requiring \nredaction. There are no clear avenues for Petitioner or \nother  members  of  the  public  to  pursue  their  First \nAmendment  claims  of  access  to  FISC  and  FISCR \nrecords. See supra Parts I, II.A. Only this Court can \nreview those courts’ rulings.  \nCONCLUSION \nPublic access to judicial opinions is necessary to \nthe  legitimacy  of  the  judicial  process  and  the \nfunctioning of democracy—especially where, as here, \nthe judicial opinions have profound implications for \nindividual rights. For reasons discussed above, the \nFISC was wrong to conclude that public access to the \nFISC’s opinions is a matter for the executive branch \nalone to decide, and both the FISC and FISCR were \nwrong to later conclude that they lack jurisdiction \n32 \n \n\neven  to  consider  Petitioner’s  motion  for  access. \nPetitioner respectfully asks this Court to correct the \nFISC’s and FISCR’s jurisdictional errors and to make \nclear that the First Amendment’s qualified right of \naccess applies to the FISC’s opinions as it does to the \nopinions of other Article III courts. \nRespectfully Submitted, \n     \nDavid D.

In \nre Opinions & Orders by the FISC Addressing Bulk \nCollection  of  Data  Under  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, 957 F.3d 1 344 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2020) \n(In  re  Opinions  &  Orders  by  the  FISC  on  Bulk \nCollection). Following our decision in that case, the \nFISC,  considering  a  separate  motion  that  sought \ndisclosure  of  other  FISC  classified  opinions  and \norders but likewise was based on a First Amendment \nright  of  access  claim,  dismissed  the  motion  after \napplying  our  reasoning in In re  Opinions & Orders \nby the FISC on Bulk Collection. See In re Opinions & \n1a \n\nOrders of this Court Containing Novel or Significant \nInterpretations of Law, FISC Docket No. Misc. 16-01 \n(FISA  Ct.  Sept.  15,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/  public-filings/opinion-\nand-order-8. This appeal followed. \nMovant American Civil Liberties Union filed with \nthis Court a Petition for Review seeking to appeal the \nFISC’s September 2020 dismissal  decision or, in  the \nalternative,  a  Petition  for  a  Writ  of  Mandamus \n(Petition). In its accompanying Notice of Appeal, the \nMovant, citing to In re Opinions & Orders by the FISC \non Bulk Collection, “recognize[d] that this Court has \npreviously  determined  that  it  does  not  have \njurisdiction  to consider  an appeal  or  petition  for a \nwrit of mandamus filed by a movant claim in g a First \nAmendment right of public access to the FISC’s legal \nopinions.”  Movant  Notice of Appeal,  filed  Oct.  1 4, \n2020. \nOn October 16, 2020, we ordered the Movant to file \na brief and show cause as to why this Court  has  the \nauthority  to entertain  the Movant’s  Petition.  The \nGovernment also was provided the opportunity to file \na response, and both Parties timely filed their briefs. \nThe  Movant  now  asks  this  Court  to  “clarify  or \nrevisit” its earlier ruling in In re Opinions & Orders \nby the FISC on Bulk Collection, or in the alternative, \nto  certify  jurisdictional  questions  raised  by  the \nMovant’s Petition to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. Movant Brief at 2. The Movant acknowledges \nthat its position relies, among other things, on an \ninterpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct that was  rejected  by  this  Court just  over six \nmonths  ago  in In re Opinions & Orders by the  FISC \non  Bulk Collection.   Id. at  3.  The  Government \n2a \n\ncounters  that  our  decision  in  that  case  controls \ndisposition of the Movant’s Petition, and  the Petition \ntherefore should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \nAfter careful consideration of the Parties’ briefs, \nwe  decline  the  Movant’s  invitation  to  revisit  our \nrecent decision. We conclude that  In re Opinions & \nOrders by the FISC on Bulk Collection applies to our \nconsideration  of the Movant’s  Petition, and  we are \nunpersuaded that the Movant has shown cause as to \nwhy this Court has jurisdiction to consider its current \nclaims.  In light of that conclusion, this case does not \npresent a question of law as to which instructions from \nthe Supreme Court are desired.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(k); \n28 U.S.C. § 1254(2). \nThe September  15, 2020 decision of the FISC is \nAFFIRMED,  and  the  Movant’s  Petition  is \nDISMISSED. \nSo ORDERED this 19th day of November, 2020. \n \n/s/ David B.

The motion invokes Rule 62 \nof the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt  Rules  of  Procedure  and  the  qualified  First \nAmendment right of access to compel the Court to \ndisclose classified opinions and orders that contain \nnovel or significant interpretations of law and were \nissued between September 11, 2001, and June 2, 2015. \nSee ACLU’s Mot. at 1, https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/ \nsites/defauJt/files/Misc%2016%2001%20Motion%20of\nl/o20the%20ACLU%20for%20the%20Release%20of%\n>20Court%20Records%20161019.pdf. \nIn  2013,  these  same  movants  filed  a  motion \narguing that both FISC Rule 62 and the qualified First \nAmendment right of access authorized this Court to \n4a \n\nexercise  jurisdiction  over  their  request  for  the \ndisclosure  of  classified  judicial  opinions  addressing \nthe legal basis for bulk collection.  See  Mot. of the \nACLU, the ACLU of the Nation’s Capital, & MFIAC \nfor the Release of Ct. Rs., Misc. No. 13-08 (Foreign \nIntel. Surv. Ct. 2013), https:// www.fisc.uscourts.gov/ \nsites/default/files/Misc%2013-08%20Motion-2.pdf. \nFour  months  ago,  the  United  States  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review dismissed \nthat motion in In re Opinions and Orders by the FISC \nAddressing  Bulk  Collection  of  Data  Under  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance Act, 957 F.3d 1344 \n(Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. of Review Apr. 24, 2020) (per \ncuriam).  The FISCR held that it lacked jurisdiction \nover the petition seeking appellate review of then-\nPresiding Judge Rosemary M. Collyer’s February 11, \n2020, decision denying the motion. Id. at 1358. \nThis  Court  is  now  convinced  that  exercising \njurisdiction  over the pending motion in this matter \nwould be inconsistent with  the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court of Review’s decision. The FISCR \ndetermined  that  it  lacked  statutory  subject-matter \njurisdiction because Congress  did  not empower  the \nfederal  courts established  under  FISA  to consider \nconstitutional claims, a freestanding motion asserting \na qualified First Amendment right of access did not \nfall  within any of the FISCR’s jurisdictional categories \nenumerated in the statute, and the movants were not \namong the parties authorized  by the statute to seek \nFISCR  review.  Id.  at  1350–51.  Noting  its \n“significantly limited powers carefully delineated by \nCongress,”  the FISCR also declined to rely on the \ndoctrine  of  ancillary  jurisdiction  to  exercise \ndiscretionary authority over the petition. Id. at 1356–\n57. It explained that such authority must be exercised \n5a \n\nwith restraint, discretion, and great caution, id. at \n1356, n.69 (citing Ex Parte  Burr, 22 U.S. 529,  53l \n(1824)),  and  that  the  movants  had  not  been \ninvoluntarily haled into court, did not seek to assert \nrights in an ongoing action, did not establish a factual \nconnection  to  the  classified  material,  and  did  not \npresent circumstances warranting the exercise of the \nFISCR’s  inherent  judicial  power  to  enforce its \nmandates and orders or protect the integrity of its \nproceedings and processes. Id. at 1356. In addition, \nbecause  the  “crux”  of  the  movants’  claim  to \ndisclosure “[lay] within the Executive’s clear authority \nto  determine  what  material  should  remain \nclassified,” the FISCR concluded that “respect for the \nseparation of  powers  dictates  that  we  dismiss  the \nPetition  for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  as  we  have  no \nbusiness  deciding  the  merits  of  the  Movants’ \nconstitutional claim.”  Id. at 1357 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nApplying the FISCR’s reasoning to whether this \nlower Court has jurisdiction over the pending motion \nleads to the same result. Like the FISCR, the FISC is \nnot empowered by Congress to consider constitutional \nclaims  generally,  First  Amendment  claims \nspecifically, or freestanding motions filed by persons \nwho  are  not  authorized  by  FISA  to  invoke  this \nCourt’s  jurisdiction.  See  id.  at  1355  (stating  that \n“specialized courts like the FISC” are not “empowered \nto  consider  claims  arising  under  the  First \nAmendment to the Constitution”), 1350–51; 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1801– l885c. And because all of the above-described \nreasons  why  the  FISCR  found  it unwarranted  to \nexercise ancillary jurisdiction apply to the pending \nmotion, the FISC is foreclosed from doing so here. \n6a \n\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the Motion of \nthe American Civil Liberties Union for the Release of \nCourt Records is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. \nSO ORDERED this 15th day of September, 2020. \n \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \nPresiding Judge, United States \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt  \n \n7a \n\n \nAPPENDIX C\nUNITED STATES \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE \nCOURT \nWASHINGTON, D.C. \n \nIN RE OPINIONS AND ORDERS OF THIS COURT \nCONTAINING NOVEL OR SIGNIFICANT \nINTERPRETATIONS OF LAW \n \nDocket No. Misc. 16-01 \n[Filed October 19, 2016] \nMotion of the American Civil Liberties Union \nfor the Release of Court Records \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nUnder the authority of the First Amendment and \npursuant to Rule 62 of this Court’s Rules of Procedure, \nthe American Civil Liberties Union (the “ACLU” or \n“Movant”) respectfully moves the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (“FISC”) to unseal its opinions and \norders containing novel or significant interpretations \nof law issued between September 11, 2001, and the \npassage of the USA FREEDOM Act on June 2, 2015.1 \nBased on public disclosures, it is clear that over the \npast  fifteen  years  the  FISC  has  developed  an \nextensive body of law—one that defines the reach of \nthe  government’s  surveillance  powers  and  broadly \n                                            \n1 Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and \nEnsuring  Effective  Discipline Over  Monitoring  Act  (“USA \nFREEDOM Act”), Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 267 (2015). \n8a \n\naffects the privacy interests of Americans. Yet, even \ntoday, many of the FISC’s significant opinions and \norders have not been disclosed to the public. These \nrulings appear to address a range of novel surveillance \nactivities, including the government’s bulk searches of \nemail received by Yahoo! customers; the government’s \nuse of so-called “Network Investigative Techniques” \n(“NITs”), more commonly known as “malware”; and \nthe government’s use of “cybersignatures” as a basis \nfor surveillance conducted pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”).2 The Court’s \nundisclosed  rulings  also  appear  to  address  the \nlawfulness  of  surveillance  conducted  under  Section \n702 of FISA—a controversial authority scheduled to \nexpire  in  December  2017.  The  significant  legal \ninterpretations of this Court are subject to the public’s \nFirst Amendment right of access, and no proper basis \nexists to keep that legal analysis secret. \nCongress  created  this  Court  in  1978  to  “hear \napplications for and grant orders approving electronic \nsurveillance”  within  the  United  States  of  foreign \npowers and their agents. FISA, Pub. L. No. 95-511, \n§ 103,  92  Stat.  1783  (1978)  (codified  at  50  U.S.C. \n§ 1803).  Since  the  disclosures  that  began  in  June \n2013, however, it has become increasingly apparent \nthat the Court does more than review individualized \nsurveillance  applications  on  a  case-by-case  basis. \nRather, the Court’s role expanded over the past fifteen \nyears to include programmatic approval and review of \ngovernment  surveillance  activities  that  affect \ncountless Americans. \n                                            \n2  In  the  attached  Appendix,  Movant  has  provided  a  non-\nexhaustive list of FISC rulings that it believes fall within the \nscope of this motion and have not yet been publicly released. \n9a \n\nThe  Court’s  new  role  was  accompanied  by  a \ngrowing body of secret law. In at least some instances, \nthe  Court’s  interpretations  departed  significantly \nfrom the public understanding of the laws at issue. \nSee, e.g., ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 812 (2015) \n(describing  the  “expansive  concept  of  ‘relevance’” \nadopted by this Court in interpreting Section 215). \nDuring the past three years, the Court has responded \nby  making  more  of  its  precedent  available  to  the \npublic, including in response to a previous motion filed \nby  the  ACLU.  See  In  re  Orders  of  this  Court \nInterpreting Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act (“In re \nSection  215  Orders”),  No.  Misc.  13-02,  2013  WL \n5460064, at *7 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013); Opinion and \nOrder Directing Declassification of Redacted Opinion \n(“Declassification Order”), In re Section 215 Orders, \nNo.  Misc.  13-02  (FISC  Aug.  7,  2014), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/1yekcfM.  Congress,  too,  has \nresponded  by  directing  the  government  to  publicly \nrelease  significant  opinions  of  this  Court  to  the \ngreatest  extent  practicable,  as  part  of  the  USA \nFREEDOM Act. See 50 U.S.C. § 1872. However, the \ngovernment has taken the position that its statutory \ndisclosure obligation does not apply to opinions that \npredate  the  Act’s  passage  on  June  2,  2015.3  As  a \nresult, a number of significant opinions and orders of \nthis Court issued prior to June 2015 remain secret.  \n                                            \n3 See Gov’t Mem., Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, No. 14-cv-00760 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 5, 2016) (ECF No. 28). But see Pl. Mot. for Partial \nSumm. J. & Opp., Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, No. 14-cv-00760 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 13, 2016) (ECF No. 32); Sen. Ron Wyden, Press \nStatement (Oct. 7, 2016) (“The USA Freedom Act requires the \nexecutive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the \nConstitution.”). \n10a \n\nThrough this Motion, the ACLU seeks access to \nthese opinions and orders for two reasons. First, some \nof  the  opinions  and  orders  pertain  to  surveillance \nprograms that are already the subject of considerable \npublic  debate—including  the  government’s  PRISM \nand  Upstream  collection  programs  conducted \npursuant to Section 702 of FISA. The public is entitled \nunder  the  First  Amendment  to  access  the  legal \ninterpretations  that  define  the  limits  of  those \nprograms.  Second,  and  more  broadly,  some  of  the \nopinions and orders relate to novel legal questions the \nCourt  addressed  as  the  government’s  surveillance \nactivities expanded after September 11, 2001, such as \nthe use of court-authorized malware and the extension \nof FISA to cybersecurity activities. These rulings are \nnecessary to inform the public about the scope of the \ngovernment’s surveillance powers today. \nThe  ACLU’s  request  for  access  to  opinions  and \norders of this Court seeks to vindicate the public’s \noverriding  interest  in  understanding  how  federal \nstatutes are being construed and implemented, and \nhow  constitutional  protections  for  personal  privacy \nand expressive and associational activities are being \nenforced. The First Amendment guarantees the public \na qualified right of access to those opinions because \njudicial  opinions  interpreting  constitutional  and \nstatutory  limits  on  governmental  authorities—\nincluding  those  relevant  to  foreign-intelligence \nsurveillance—have  regularly  been  available  for \ninspection by the public, and because their release is \nmanifestly fundamental in a democracy committed to \nthe rule of law. Public disclosure serves to improve the \nfunctioning  of  the  Court  itself,  to  enhance  its \nperceived fairness and independence, and to educate \ncitizens  about  the  Court’s  role  in  ensuring  the \n11a \n\nintegrity of the FISA system. This First Amendment \nguarantee of public access may be overcome only if the \ngovernment  is  able  to  demonstrate  a  substantial \nprobability of harm to a compelling interest and the \nabsence  of  any  alternative  means  to  protect  that \ninterest. Any limits on the public’s right of access must \nthen be narrowly tailored and demonstrably effective \nin avoiding that harm. \nThe ACLU respectfully asks this Court to order the \ngovernment  to  promptly  process  and  prepare  for \npublication  opinions  and  orders  of  this  Court \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law, \nincluding but not limited to those identified in the \nAppendix.4  Because  the  opinions  are  of  critical \nimportance to the ongoing public debate about the \nlegitimacy  and  wisdom  of  the  government’s \nsurveillance  activities,  the  ACLU  respectfully \nrequests that the Court order the publication of the \nopinions  as  quickly  as  possible,  with  only  those \nredactions  justified  under  the  stringent  First \nAmendment standard. \n                                            \n4 Movant notes that, since 2004, the government has been \nrequired to identify, summarize, and provide to the Intelligence \nand  Judiciary  Committees  of  both  houses  of  Congress \n“significant”  legal  interpretations  of  FISA.  50  U.S.C.  § \n1871(a)(4)–(5); see also id. § 1871(c). Similarly, for FISC opinions \nrelated to § 702 of FISA, the executive branch is required to \ncategorize the Court’s opinions as containing a significant legal \ninterpretation or not. 50 U.S.C. § 1881f(b)(1)(D) (requiring the \ngovernment to provide copies to Congress of any FISC opinion \n“that contains a significant legal interpretation of the provisions \nof [Section 702 of FISA]”). \nWhere there is a question as to whether an opinion or order \nconstitutes a significant interpretation of law, Movant requests \nthat  the  Court  make  a  determination  as  to  the  ruling’s \nsignificance. \n12a \n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn June 2013, various press outlets disclosed the \nexistence  of  previously  unknown  government \nsurveillance  programs,  including  the  National \nSecurity  Agency’s  bulk  collection  of  telephone \nmetadata  pursuant  to  50  U.S.C.  §  1861,  and  the \nPRISM  and  Upstream  programs  operated  under \nSection 702 of FISA, which the government uses to \nseize  and  search  vast  quantities  of  Internet \ncommunications.5 These news stories and subsequent \nreporting and disclosures alerted the  public to the \nexistence of a growing body of important FISC rulings \non matters of significant public interest. While the \nFISC was created to hear individualized surveillance \ndemands, the orders and opinions that were published \nwith the leaked documents revealed that the FISC \nwas also authorizing  and  overseeing  several  broad \nprograms of surveillance, relying on a body of its own \nopinions  interpreting  statutory  and  constitutional \nlaw. Because FISC opinions were rarely published, \nthe disclosures made the public aware that it was \nbeing (and had for some time been) denied access to a \ngrowing body of secret law. \nTo address the public’s concerns that developed in \nthe  wake  of  these  disclosures  about  the  legal \nfoundations of the government’s various surveillance \nprograms,  the  government  began to  declassify  and \nrelease  significant  information  related  to  its \n                                            \n5  See, e.g., Glenn Greenwald, NSA Collecting Phone Records of \nMillions of Verizon Customers Daily, Guardian, June 6, 2013, \nhttp://gu.com/p/3gc62; Barton Gellman & Laura Poitras, U.S., \nBritish  Intelligence  Mining  Data  from  Nine  U.S.  Internet \nCompanies in Broad Secret Program, Wash. Post, June 7, 2013, \nhttp://wpo.st/eW7Y1. \n13a \n\nsurveillance activities. For example, in the months \nimmediately following the initial news stories about \nthe  government’s  bulk  call-records  program,  the \ngovernment released a white paper providing more \ndetails about the program, its purported value, and its \nlegal underpinnings.6 And the Office of the Director of \nNational  Intelligence  (“ODNI”)  began  a  marked \nincrease in its communications with the public about \nthe  government’s  national-security  surveillance \nprograms.7 \nThis  Court  also  grasped  the  immense  public \ninterest  surrounding  the  government’s  surveillance \nactivities and the need for public access to its opinions \nand orders. After the initial disclosures in June 2013, \nthis Court began to makes more of its opinions and \norders available to the public as a matter of course.8 \nIn In re Section 215 Orders, the Court acknowledged \nthe important values served by the disclosure of these \nopinions. It noted that previous public disclosures had \n“engendered considerable public interest and debate” \nand that further “[p]ublication of FISC opinions . . . \nwould  contribute  to  that  debate.”9  The  Court  also \nunderscored the assertions by legislators of the “value \n                                            \n6 Administration White Paper: Bulk Collection of Telephony \nMetadata Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Aug. 9, \n2013), http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/Section215.pdf. \n7 As one example of its increased outreach efforts, the ODNI \nbegan utilizing social media to address these important matters \nof public concern and to release declassified documents, including \nopinions of this Court, to the public. See ODNI, IC on the Record, \nhttps://icontherecord.tumblr.com/. \n8  See  generally  Public  Filings–FISC,  http://www.fisc. \nuscourts.gov/public-filings. \n9 In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7. \n14a \n\nof public information and debate in representing their \nconstituents  and  discharging  their  legislative \nresponsibilities,”  and  affirmed  that  “[p]ublication \nwould  also  assure  citizens  of  the  integrity  of  this \nCourt’s proceedings.”10  Likely for the same reason, \nthe  Court’s  then-Presiding  Judge  published  his \ncorrespondence with Congress explaining the FISC’s \noperating procedures and detailing certain statistics \nconcerning  the  Court’s  approval  of  government \napplications.11  \nThe intense public interest triggered by the June \n2013 surveillance disclosures has only grown in the \nensuing years. For almost three years, the American \npeople  have  taken  part  in  a  wide-ranging  public \ndebate  about  the  scope,  interpretations,  and \nappropriate bounds of our nation’s surveillance laws. \nNew  details  have  continued  to  emerge  about  the \ngovernment’s  programs.12  Executive-branch  bodies \nhave  engaged  in  significant  public  oversight  of \nsurveillance  programs,  conducting  hearings  with \ngovernment and outside experts, and issuing reports \n                                            \n10 Id.; see Mem.

For example, news reports published \nearlier  this  month  revealed  the  existence  of  a \npreviously  undisclosed  order  from  this  Court \nrequiring Yahoo! to scan, in real time, all incoming \nemail traffic for a particular computer “signature.”15 \nTo  comply,  Yahoo!  reportedly  developed  a  custom \nscanning system and searched hundreds of millions of \nemails, storing and making available to the FBI copies \nof any emails containing the signature(s) specified by \nthe  government.16  The  revelation  of  Yahoo!’s  bulk \nemail searching has drawn public alarm.

Based on official disclosures \nand  media  reports,  that  body  of  law  appears  to \nencompass, among other things: the government’s use \nof  malware,  or  NITs,  in  foreign-intelligence \ninvestigations, see Appendix, No. 2; the government’s \nuse  of  FISA  to  compel  technology  companies  to \nweaken or circumvent encryption protocols, see id.

Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, \n598 (1978); accord Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. \n32,  43  (1991)  (“It  has  long  been  understood  that \n[c]ertain implied powers must necessarily result to \nour  Courts  of  justice  from  the  nature  of  their \ninstitution.”).  As  this  Court  has  previously \ndetermined, the FISC therefore has “jurisdiction in \nthe first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the \ncourt’s very own records and files.” In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 487 \n(FISC 2007). \nARGUMENT \nI.  MOVANT HAS STANDING TO BRING \nTHIS PUBLIC-ACCESS MOTION. \nTo  demonstrate  Article  III  standing,  a  party \nseeking  judicial  action  must  show  “(1)  that  it  has \nsuffered an ‘injury in fact’; (2) that the injury is caused \nby or fairly traceable to the challenged actions of the \n                                            \n19 By one estimate, there are at least 25 to 30 significant FISC \nopinions and orders issued between mid-2003 and mid-2013 that \nremain sealed, and several more that were issued in the two \nyears prior to the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act.  See \nElizabeth Goitein, Brennan Ctr. for Justice, The New Era of \nSecret Law 60–61 (2016), http://bit.ly/2eNep2g. \n18a \n\ndefendant; and (3) that it is likely that the injury will \nbe redressed by a favorable decision.” Ethyl Corp. v. \nEPA,  306  F.3d  1144,  1147  (D.C.  Cir.  2002)  (citing \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)).  As  the  Court  found  when  addressing  the \nACLU’s 2013 motion, each element is met here. See In \nre Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *2–4. \nThe  ACLU’s  injury  here—a  denial  of  access  to \ncourt  opinions—is  concrete  and  particularized.  See \nGlobe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Cty. of \nNorfolk, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); Richmond Newspapers \nInc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 576 (1980); N.Y. Civil \nLiberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), \n684 F.3d 286, 294–95 (2d Cir. 2011); In re Wash. Post, \n807  F.2d  383,  388  n.4  (4th  Cir.  1986). The ACLU \nactively  participates  in  the  legislative  and  public \ndebates about the proper scope of the government’s \nsurveillance authorities, including the lawfulness of \nSection  702  surveillance,  the  government’s \ndeployment of malware, and the meaning of FISA’s \nprovisions.20 And plainly, the ACLU’s injury is both \ncaused by the denial of public access to the opinions \nand orders sought here, see Valley Forge Christian \nColl. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, \n454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982), and would be redressed by \nthe requested relief, see Town of Barnstable v. FAA, \n659 F.3d 28, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n                                            \n20 See, e.g., Submission of ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel \nJaffer, PCLOB Public Hearing on Section 702 of FISA (Mar. 19, \n2014), http://bit.ly/2djfoqM; Joe Uchill, ACLU Questions How Tor \nEmail Users Got FBI-Deployed Malware, Hill, Sept. 6, 2016, \nhttp://bit.ly/2cIZ82T. \n19a \n\nII.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT REQUIRES \nTHE RELEASE OF THIS COURT’S \nOPINIONS AND ORDERS CONTAINING \nNOVEL OR SIGNIFICANT \nINTERPRETATIONS OF LAW. \nA. The First Amendment Right of Access \nAttaches to Judicial Opinions, \nIncluding the Opinions of this Court \nConcerning Novel or Significant \nInterpretations of Law. \nThat the judicial process should be as open to the \npublic as possible is a principle enshrined in both the \nConstitution  and  the  common  law.  See  Richmond \nNewspapers, 448 U.S. at 564–73; Lugosch v. Pyramid \nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006) \n(“The common law right of public access to judicial \ndocuments is firmly rooted in our nation’s history.”); \ncf. Letter from James Madison to W.T. Barry (Aug. 4, \n1822), in 9 Writings of James Madison at 103 (G. Hunt \ned. 1910) (“A popular Government, without popular \ninformation, or the means of acquiring it, is but a \nPrologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both.”). \nUnder  the  Supreme  Court’s  prevailing  “experience \nand logic” test, the First Amendment right of public \naccess attaches to judicial proceedings and records \nwhere (a) the type of judicial process or record sought \nhas historically been available to the public, and (b) \npublic access plays a “significant positive role” in the \nfunctioning of the process itself. Press-Enter. Co. v. \nSuperior Court (“Press-Enter. II”), 478 U.S. 1, 9, 11 \n(1986);  see  Globe  Newspaper,  457  U.S.  at  605–07; \nWash. Post v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 282, 287–92 (D.C. \nCir. 1991). Proceedings and records to which the right \nof  access  attaches  are  presumptively  open  to  the \npublic  and  may  be  closed  only  where  there  is  a \n20a \n\nsubstantial  probability  of  harm  to  a  compelling \ngovernment interest, and where no alternative to a \nnarrow  limitation  of  access  can  effectively  protect \nagainst that harm. NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296. In other \nwords, the right of access is qualified but may not be \ndenied without “specific, on the record findings” that \n“closure is essential to preserve higher values and is \nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest.” Press-Enter. \nII,  478  U.S.  at  13–14  (quoting  Press-Enter.  Co.  v. \nSuperior Court (“Press-Enter. I”), 464 U.S. 501, 510 \n(1984)).  \nHere, there is a nearly unbroken tradition of public \naccess to judicial rulings and opinions interpreting the \nConstitution and our laws. Moreover, public access to \nsuch  rulings  allows  the  public  to  function  as  an \nessential  check  on  the  government  and  improves \njudicial  decisionmaking.  Those  interests  are \nparticularly  acute  in  the  context  of  this  Court’s \nopinions interpreting the reach and constitutionality \nof the government’s surveillance authorities. Access \nwould enhance the functioning of this Court and the \nFISA system by facilitating effective public oversight; \nincreasing the legitimacy and independence of this \nCourt;  subjecting  this  Court’s  legal  opinions  to \nscrutiny  within  our  common-law  system;  and \npermitting Congress, subject-matter experts, and the \nbroader  public  to  evaluate  this  Court’s  legal \ninterpretations as they consider changes to the law. \nFor these reasons, and as explained more fully below, \nthe  constitutional  right  of  access  extends  to  the \nopinions and orders of this Court concerning novel or \nsignificant interpretations of law. \n21a \n\n1.  “Experience” \nNot only is there a nearly unbroken tradition of \npublic  access  to  judicial  rulings  and  opinions \ninterpreting the Constitution and the laws governing \nthe  American  people,  but  Congress  has  recently \nreaffirmed  that  tradition  with  respect  to  this  very \nCourt. See USA FREEDOM Act § 402 (codified at 50 \nU.S.C.  §  1872)  (requiring  decisions,  orders,  and \nopinions  of  the  FISC  containing  “significant \nconstruction[s] or interpretation[s] of any provision of \nlaw” be made “publicly available to the greatest extent \npracticable”). \nNo  type  of  judicial  record  enjoys  a  more \nuninterrupted  history  of  openness  than  judicial \nopinions. As explained by the Third Circuit:  \nAs ours is a common-law system based \non the “directive force” of precedents, its \neffective  and  efficient  functioning \ndemands wide dissemination of judicial \ndecisions  Even that part of the law \nwhich  consists  of  codified  statutes  is \nincomplete  without  the  accompanying \nbody of judicial decisions construing the \nstatutes. Accordingly, under our system \nof  jurisprudence  the  judiciary  has  the \nduty of publishing and disseminating its \ndecisions.  \nLowenschuss v. W. Publ’g Co., 542 F.2d 180, 185 (3d \nCir. 1976) (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature \nof the Judicial Process 20, 21–22 (1963)); see Scheiner \nv. Wallace, No. 93-cv-0062, 1996 WL 633226, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y.

Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048–\n49 (2d Cir. 1995))). \nDissemination  of  judicial  opinions  is  necessary \nboth for the public to understand what the law is and \nto preserve the legitimacy of the judicial process. See \nU.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P’ship, 513 \nU.S. 18, 26 (1994) (“[J]udicial precedents are valuable \nto  the  legal  community  as  a  whole.  They  are  not \nmerely  the  property  of  private  litigants.”);  accord \nLowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185; see also Union Oil Co. \nv.  Leavell,  220  F.3d  562,  568  (7th  Cir.  2000) \n(Easterbrook,  J.)  (“What  happens  in  the  halls  of \ngovernment is presumptively public business. Judges \ndeliberate in private but issue public decisions after \npublic  arguments  based  on  public  records.  The \npolitical branches of government claim legitimacy by \nelection, judges by reason. Any step that withdraws \nan element of the judicial process from public view \nmakes the ensuing decision look more like fiat, which \nrequires  compelling  justification.”).  Accordingly, \nappellate courts have recognized that public access to \nopinions  is  protected  by  the  First  Amendment. \nCompany Doe v. Public Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 267–68 \n(4th Cir. 2014) (finding that “it would be anomalous” \nfor the First Amendment to apply to some judicial \nrecords but not to “the court’s opinion itself”); United \nStates v. Mentzos, 462 F.3d 830, 843 n.4 (8th Cir. 2006) \n(denying motion to file opinion under seal “because the \ndecisions of the court are a matter of public record”); \nUnion Oil, 220 F.3d at 568 (“[I]t should go without \nsaying that the judge’s opinions and orders belong in \nthe public domain.”). \nGiven  this  history,  courts  have  customarily \ndisclosed  opinions  dealing  with  the  government’s \nauthority  to  conduct  investigations  and  gather \n23a \n\ninformation  about  individuals,  particularly  U.S. \ncitizens. For example, the First Amendment right of \naccess  has  been  held  to  apply  to  judicial  opinions \nconstruing  the  government’s  search  and  seizure \npowers. See In re Application of N.Y. Times Co. for \nAccess to Certain Sealed Court Records, 585 F. Supp. \n2d  83,  88  (D.D.C.  2008).  And  federal  courts  have \nroutinely  published  their  opinions  interpreting  the \nscope and constitutionality of intelligence collection \npermitted under FISA and related authorities—the \nvery type of opinions the ACLU seeks here. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. U.S. Dist. Court for the E. Dist. of \nMich.,  407  U.S.  297  (1972)  (considering \nconstitutionality of warrantless- wiretapping program \nconducted by the government to “protect the national \nsecurity”); United States v.

See  USA  FREEDOM  Act  §  402. \n24a \n\nRecognizing  the  importance  of  the  FISC’s \njurisprudence, Congress has explicitly required this \nCourt’s  opinions  and  orders  involving  “significant \nconstruction[s] or interpretation[s] of any provision of \nlaw” be made “publicly available to the greatest extent \npracticable.” 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a); see also id. § 1872(b) \n(stating that redacted versions of opinions and orders \nmay meet the statutory requirement). Congress set a \nhigh bar for withholding such opinions and orders, \nand even where they can properly be withheld, the \nAttorney  General  must  publicly  release  an \nunclassified statement summarizing their contents. \nId. § 1872(c) (indicating non-disclosure is appropriate \nonly where “necessary to protect the national security \nof the United States” and outlining Attorney General’s \nobligations when opinions and orders are withheld). \nThat until recently FISC opinions were ordinarily \nsealed  is  of  no  moment  to  the  First  Amendment’s \n“experience” test. The Supreme Court has instructed \nthat the experience prong of its two-part test “does not \nlook to the particular practice of any one jurisdiction, \nbut instead ‘to the experience in that type or kind of \nhearing throughout the United States . . . .’” El Vocero \nde P.R. v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per \ncuriam) (quoting Rivera-Puig v. Garcia- Rosario, 983 \nF.2d 311, 323 (1st Cir. 1992)). In other words, the \nproper focus of the “experience” analysis is the type of \ngovernmental process or record to which a petitioner \nseeks access, not the past practice of the specific forum \nin which such access is being sought. See, e.g., NYCTA, \n684  F.3d  at  301  (rejecting  view  that  “Richmond \nNewspapers test looks to the formal description of the \nforum”); Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d \n83, 94 (2d Cir. 2004) (examining First Amendment \nright  of  access  to  court  “docket  sheets  and  their \n25a \n\nhistorical counterparts,” beginning with early English \ncourts); In re Bos. Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st \nCir. 2003) (experience test includes examination of \n“analogous proceedings and documents”). \nIn  assessing  how  the  past  experience  of  access \napplies to a new forum, it is inappropriate to analyze \nonly the history of that forum itself. Because there will \nnever be a tradition of public access in new forums, \nthis approach would permit Congress to circumvent \nthe constitutional right of access altogether—even as \nto, say, criminal trials—simply by providing that such \ntrials henceforth be heard in a newly created forum. \nSee,  e.g.,  NYCTA,  684  F.3d  at  299  (“Immunizing \ngovernment  proceedings  from  public  scrutiny  by \nplacing them in institutions the Framers could not \nhave  imagined . . . would  make  avoidance  of \nconstitutional protections all too easy.”); In re Copley \nPress, Inc., 518 F.3d 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 2008). The \nproper approach, therefore, is to examine whether the \ntype of proceeding or record at issue—here, judicial \nopinions  interpreting  the  meaning  and \nconstitutionality of public statutes—has historically \nbeen open or available to the public. See, e.g., NYCTA, \n684 F.3d at 299. \n2.  “Logic” \nJust  as  fundamentally,  public  access  to  the \nopinions of this Court is important to the functioning \nof both the law in general and the FISA system in \nparticular. \nThe  “significant  positive  role”  of  public  judicial \ndecisionmaking in a democracy is so essential that it \nis  hardly  ever  questioned.  Courts  have  repeatedly \nrecognized  that  public  access  to  judicial  opinions \nserves a vital function: \n26a \n\nThe decisions and opinions of the justices \nare  the  authorized  expositions  and \ninterpretations  of  the  laws,  which  are \nbinding  upon  all  the  citizens.  They \ndeclare the unwritten law, and construe \nand declare the meaning of the statutes. \nEvery citizen is presumed to know the \nlaw  thus  declared,  and  it  needs  no \nargument to show that justice requires \nthat all should have free access to the \nopinions,  and  that  it  is  against  sound \npublic  policy  to  prevent  this,  or  to \nsuppress  and  keep  from  the  earliest \nknowledge of the public the statutes, or \nthe decisions and opinions of the justices. \nSuch opinions stand, upon principle, on \nsubstantially  the  same  footing  as  the \nstatutes enacted by the legislature. It can \nhardly  be  contended  that  it  would  be \nwithin  the  constitutional  power  of  the \nlegislature to enact that the statutes and \nopinions should not be made known to \nthe public. The policy of the state always \nhas been that the opinions of the justices, \nafter they are delivered, belong to the \npublic.  \nNash  v.  Lathrop,  142  Mass.  29,  35–36  (1886) \n(emphasis added) (cited by Banks v. Manchester, 128 \nU.S. 244, 253–54 (1888)); see also Lowenschuss, 542 \nF.2d at 185. The importance of public access to judicial \nopinions flows from two bedrock principles: (1) the \npublic’s right to know what the law is, as a condition \nof  democratic  governance;  and  (2)  the  founding \nrecognition  that,  in  our  political  system,  it  is \n“emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \ndepartment  to  say  what  the  law  is.”  Marbury  v. \n27a \n\nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). Because \ncourts determine what the law means—and therefore \nwhat the law is—the societal need for access to judicial \nopinions is paramount. \nThe value in making judicial opinions available to \nthe public only increases where, as here, the opinions \nconcern both the power of the executive branch and \nthe  constitutional  rights  of  citizens.  See  FTC  v. \nStandard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st \nCir. 1987) (access to court files “accentuated” where \n“the public’s right to know what the executive branch \nis about coalesces with the concomitant right of the \ncitizenry  to  appraise  the  judicial  branch”);  In  re \nPR/TT  with  CSLI,  396  F.  Supp.  2d  at  748–49 \n(refusing government request to seal order that “has \nserious implications for the balance between privacy \nand law enforcement”). \nThis  principle  applies  with  equal  force  in  the \ncontext  of  national  security,  where  the  courts \nroutinely recognize and give effect to the public’s right \nof  access  to  judicial  opinions  and  orders.  See,  e.g., \nUnited States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82–83 (2d Cir. \n2008); In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 393; United States \nv. Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 710, 716–17 (E.D. Va. \n2007). In fact, where matters of national security are \nat  stake,  the  role  of  public  evaluation  of  judicial \ndecisions takes on an even weightier role. See, e.g., In \nre  Wash.  Post,  807  F.2d  at  393;  United  States  v. \nRessam,  221  F.  Supp.  2d  1252,  1262  (W.D.  Wash. \n2002); see also N.Y. Times Co. v. United States, 403 \nU.S. 713, 719 (1971) (Black, J., concurring) (stating \nthat “fully aware of . . . the need to defend a new \nnation,” the Framers wrote the First Amendment “to \ngive this new society strength and security”); Det. Free \nPress v. Ashcroft, 303 F.3d 681, 709–10 (6th Cir. 2002) \n28a \n\n(finding invocation of non-specific “national security” \nconcerns  insufficient  to  overcome  public’s  qualified \nright of access to quasi-judicial proceedings). \nPublic  access  to  the  opinions  of  this  Court  is \nimportant to the functioning of the law and the FISA \nsystem in several respects. \nFirst, public access to the opinions of this Court \nwill  promote  public  confidence  in  the  integrity, \nreliability,  and  independence  of  the  FISC  and  the \nFISA system. Access to the reasoning and actions of \nthis Court will allow the public to evaluate for itself \nthe operation of the FISA system and the legal bases \nfor the government’s actions. As the Supreme Court \nhas  explained,  “[p]eople  in  an  open  society  do  not \ndemand infallibility from their institutions, but it is \ndifficult for them to accept what they are prohibited \nfrom  observing.”  Press-Enter.  II,  478  U.S.  at  13 \n(quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Globe Newspaper, \n457 U.S. at 606 (public access to court documents and \nproceedings  “fosters  an  appearance  of  fairness, \nthereby  heightening  public  respect  for  the  judicial \nprocess”);  Aref,  533  F.3d  at  83  (“Transparency  is \npivotal  to  public  perception  of  the  judiciary’s \nlegitimacy and independence.”); In re Orion Pictures \nCorp., 21 F.3d 24, 26 (2d Cir. 1994) (public access \n“helps safeguard the integrity, quality, and respect in \nour judicial system, and permits the public to keep a \nwatchful  eye  on  the  workings  of  public  agencies” \n(quotation marks and citations omitted)); Ressam, 221 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  1263  (explaining  that  “the  general \npractice of disclosing court orders to the public not \nonly plays a significant role in the judicial process, but \nis also a fundamental aspect of our country’s open \nadministration of justice”).  \n29a \n\nSecond,  and  relatedly,  access  to  this  Court’s \nopinions will improve democratic oversight. Because \nthe  information  released  to  date  does  not  fully \ndescribe the constitutional and statutory bases for the \ngovernment’s surveillance activities under FISA, the \nrelease of the requested opinions would permit the \npublic—and Congress itself—to more properly assess \nthese programs and to take action accordingly. See \ngenerally Br. of Amici Curiae U.S. Representatives \nAmash et al. in Support of the Motion of the ACLU \nand MFIAC for the Release of Court Records, In re \nSection 215 Orders, No. 13-02 (FISC June 28, 2013), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/1ORRcc4. Members of Congress have \nacknowledged the importance of proper oversight, but \nthat  oversight  has  been  impeded  by  the  secrecy \nsurrounding  the  Court’s  interpretations  of  the \ngovernment’s  surveillance  powers.  See,  e.g.,  Letter \nfrom  Sens.  Dianne  Feinstein,  Jeff  Merkley,  Ron \nWyden & Mark Udall to Hon. John Bates, Presiding \nJudge,  FISC  (Feb.  13,  2013),  http://bit.ly/2eeW0cf. \nIndeed, members of this Court have recognized the \nvalue of public disclosure of its opinions construing the \ngovernment’s surveillance authority. See, e.g., In re \nSection 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7; cf. Ellen \nNakashima & Carol D. Leonnig, Effort Underway to \nDeclassify  Document  that  Is  Legal  Foundation  for \nNSA  Phone  Program,  Wash.  Post,  Oct.  12,  2013, \nhttp://wpo.st/qsYb1  (“[Judge]  Kollar-Kotelly  told \nassociates  this  summer  that  she  wanted  her  legal \nargument out, according to two people familiar with \nwhat she said. Several members of the intelligence \ncourt want more transparency about the court’s role \nto dispel what they consider a misperception that the \ncourt acted as a rubber stamp for the administration’s \ntop-secret spying programs.”). As the Supreme Court \nnoted in Richmond Newspapers, “[w]ithout publicity, \n30a \n\nall  other  checks  are  insufficient:  in  comparison  of \npublicity, all other checks are of small account.” 448 \nU.S.  at  569  (quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting \nJeremy Bentham, Rationale of Judicial Evidence 524 \n(1827)).  In  enacting  the  USA  FREEDOM  Act, \nCongress acknowledged these interests and sought to \ngive the public access to the Court’s significant legal \npronouncements. See 50 U.S.C. § 1872; 161 Cong. Rec. \nS2772–01, S2778–79 (statement of Sen. Blumenthal). \nThird, allowing the public to review and assess the \nreasoning of the opinions of this Court will support \nmore refined judicial decisionmaking in future cases. \nFor example, since public attention focused on FISA \nsurveillance  and  this  Court’s  rulings  beginning  in \nJune 2013, there has been a proliferation of highly \nsophisticated  legal  and  technical  debate  over  the \nfoundations  of  the  government’s  various  national-\nsecurity  surveillance  programs.21  In  camera \ndecisionmaking  cannot  provide  the  Court  with  the \nsame  breadth  of  analysis  and  expertise,  especially \nover the long-term, because it does not allow for the \nsame  interplay  and  development  of  various \nviewpoints. The detailed public discussion that has \nbegun today was impossible prior to the release of this \nCourt’s opinions, and it can only benefit the FISA \nsystem. \n                                            \n21 See, e.g., Laura K. Donohue, Section 702 and the Collection of \nInternational Telephone and Internet Content, 38 Harv. J.L. & \nPub.  Pol’y  117  (2015),  http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp- \ncontent/uploads/2015/02/Donohue_Final.pdf; David S. Kris, On \nthe Bulk Collection of Tangible Things,  Lawfare  Res.  Paper \nSeries (Sep. 29, 2013), http://bit.ly/2eKWyZT; Steven M. Bellovin \net al., It’s Too Complicated: How the Internet Upends  Katz, \nSmith, and Electronic Surveillance Law, Harv. J. of L. & Tech. \n(forthcoming 2016), http://bit.ly/2ectB8K. \n31a \n\nFourth, publishing this Court’s opinions of broad \nlegal  significance  will  contribute  to  the  body  of \ndecisional  law  essential  to  the  functioning  of  our \ncommon-law system. Article III courts have always \nbuilt upon the work of their predecessors by refining, \nreworking, or even, at times, abandoning decisions \nissued in the past. See, e.g., Penny v. Little, 4 Ill. (3 \nScam.)  301,  304  (1841)  (“The  common  law  is  a \nbeautiful  system;  containing  the  wisdom  and \nexperience of ages.”). This iterative process lies at the \nfoundation of our legal system but has been stunted \nby the continued secrecy of this Court’s significant \nlegal opinions. Other courts should have access to this \nCourt’s determinations relating to surveillance, new \ntechnologies,  privacy,  and  First  Amendment \nprotections so that they may rely on, respond to, or \ndistinguish this Court’s reasoning.22 Both the FISC \nand  ordinary  federal  courts  have  important \nperspectives to offer on emerging legal issues related \nto  surveillance  that  inescapably  cut  across \njurisdictions and even statutes. That courts might, \nwhen permitted to engage in an open and good-faith \ndebate about such matters, disagree—or agree—about \nthe proper outcomes, is a strength of the common-law \nsystem—not a reason to keep one jurisdiction’s law \n                                            \n22 See also, e.g., California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386, 400–01 \n(1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“The only true rules governing \nsearch and seizure have been formulated and refined in the \npainstaking scrutiny of case-by-case adjudication. . . . To identify \nrules that will endure, we must rely on the state and lower \nfederal courts to debate and evaluate the different approaches to \ndifficult  and  unresolved  questions  of  constitutional  law. \nDeliberation  on  the  question  over  time  winnows  out  the \nunnecessary and discordant elements of doctrine and preserves \n‘whatever  is  pure  and  sound  and  fine.’”  (quoting  Benjamin \nCardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 179 (1921))). \n32a \n\nsiloed and unavailable for logical development. See, \ne.g., Clapper, 785 F.3d 787; Cent. States, Se. & Sw. \nAreas Pension Fund v. Int’l Comfort Prods., LLC, 585 \nF.3d  281,  287  (6th  Cir.  2009)  (agreeing  with  the \nFISCR that it is important to avoid a “snowballing of \nprecedent  unconnected  to  the  ‘actual  statutory \nlanguage at issue’”) (citing In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d \n717, 725–27 (FISCR 2002)). \nFor  these  reasons,  disclosure  of  this  Court’s \nopinions  addressing  novel  interpretations  of  the \ngovernment’s  surveillance  authorities  would \ncontribute to the functioning of the FISA system and \nbenefit  the  public  interest.  Cf.  In  re  Section  215 \nOrders,  2013  WL  5460064,  at  *7  (stating  that \n“movants  and  amici  have  presented  several \nsubstantial reasons why the public interest might be \nserved  by  the[]  publication”  of  FISC  opinions \ninterpreting Section 215). \n*  *  * \nIn sum, because there is a longstanding American \ntradition of public access to judicial opinions; because \nsuch access positively contributes to the integrity of \nthe judicial process, the democratic legitimacy of this \nCourt, and the public understanding of laws passed in \nits name; and because the release of the requested \nopinions and orders would illuminate crucial gaps in \nthe public knowledge about the legal justifications for \nits government’s surveillance activities, the public’s \nFirst  Amendment  right  of  access  attaches  to  the \nCourt’s legal opinions containing novel or significant \ninterpretations of law. \nThis  Court  erred  in  concluding  otherwise  in \ndenying a 2007 public-access motion brought by the \nACLU. First, by limiting its analysis to whether two \n33a \n\npreviously published opinions of this Court “establish \na tradition of public access,” the Court took too narrow \na  view  of  the  “experience”  prong  of  the  Supreme \nCourt’s test. See In re Motion for Release of Court \nRecords, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 493 (emphasis omitted). \nAgain, “the ‘experience’ test of Globe Newspaper does \nnot  look  to  the  particular  practice  of  any  one \njurisdiction, but instead to the experience in that type \nor kind of hearing throughout the United States.” El \nVocero, 508 U.S. at 150 (quotation marks omitted). \nSecond,  the  Court  erred  in  concluding  that  public \naccess  would  “result  in  a  diminished  flow  of \ninformation,  to  the  detriment  of  the  process  in \nquestion.”  See  In  re  Motion  for  Release  of  Court \nRecords, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496. Instead, disclosure of \nthe  requested  opinions  would  serve  weighty \ndemocratic interests by informing the governed about \nthe meaning of public laws enacted on their behalf. \nB. The First Amendment Requires \nDisclosure of the Court’s Opinions \nContaining Novel or Significant \nInterpretations of Law. \nAlthough the First Amendment right of access is a \nqualified one, judicial records that are subject to the \nright may be kept from the public only upon a rigorous \nshowing. Different formulations have been used by \nvarious courts to define the showing that must be \nmade,  but  the  governing  standard  applied  by  the \nSupreme Court encompasses four distinct factors: \n1.  There must be a “substantial probability” \nof  prejudice  to  a  compelling  interest.  A \nparty  seeking  to  restrict  the  right  of  access \nmust  demonstrate  a  substantial  probability \nthat openness will cause harm to a compelling \n34a \n\ngovernmental interest. See, e.g., Press-Enter. II, \n478 U.S. at 13–14; Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at \n510; Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 580–\n81. In Press-Enterprise II, the Court specifically \nheld that a “reasonable likelihood” standard is \nnot sufficiently protective of the right and that \na “substantial probability” standard must be \napplied.  478  U.S.  at  14–15.  This  standard \napplies  equally  in  the  context  of  national \nsecurity. See In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 392. \n2.  There  must  be  no  alternative  to \nadequately  protect  the  threatened \ninterest. A party seeking to defeat access must \nfurther  demonstrate  that  nothing  short  of  a \nlimitation on the constitutional right of access \ncan adequately protect the threatened interest. \nSee Press- Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 13–14; see also \nPresley v. Georgia, 558 U.S. 209, 214–15 (2010) \n(per  curiam)  (“[T]rial  courts  are  required  to \nconsider alternatives to closure even when they \nare  not  offered  by  the  parties”  and  “are \nobligated to take every reasonable measure to \naccommodate  public  attendance  at  criminal \ntrials.”); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d 93, 100 (2d \nCir.  1984)  (A  “trial  judge  must  consider \nalternatives and reach a reasoned conclusion \nthat closure is a preferable course to follow to \nsafeguard the interests at issue.”); Robinson, \n935 F.2d at 290. \n3.  Any  restriction  on  access  must  be \nnarrowly  tailored.  Even  “legitimate  and \nsubstantial” governmental interests “cannot be \npursued  by  means  that  broadly  stifle \nfundamental personal liberties when the end \ncan  be  more  narrowly  achieved.”  Shelton  v. \n35a \n\nTucker,  364  U.S.  479,  488  (1960).  Any \nlimitation imposed on public access thus must \nbe  no broader  than  necessary  to  protect  the \nthreatened interest. See, e.g., Press-Enter. II, \n478 U.S. at 13–14; Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124; \nRobinson, 935 F.2d at 287. \n4.  Any  restriction  on  access  must  be \neffective. Any order limiting access must be \neffective in protecting the threatened interest \nfor  which  the  limitation  is  imposed.  As \narticulated  in  Press-Enterprise  II,  the  party \nseeking secrecy must demonstrate “that closure \nwould prevent” the harm sought to be avoided. \n478 U.S. at 14; see Robinson, 935 F.2d at 291– \n92  (disclosure  could  not  pose  any  additional \nthreat  in  light  of  already  publicized \ninformation); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d at 101 \n(closure order cannot stand if “the information \nsought to be kept confidential has already been \ngiven  sufficient  public  exposure”);  United \nStates v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 322 (D.C. Cir. \n1980)  (“One  possible  reason  for  unsealing  is \nthat the documents were already made public \nthrough other means.”). \nThe party seeking to restrict access bears the burden \nof presenting specific facts that satisfy this four-part \ntest. See Press-Enter. II, 478 U.S. at 15 (“The First \nAmendment right of access cannot be overcome by [a] \nconclusory assertion.”). \nThe  government  cannot  satisfy  these  strict \nstandards in order to justify withholding the FISC’s \nsignificant and novel opinions and orders in full. The \nproposition that the government has an interest—let \nalone a “compelling” one—in preventing disclosure of \n36a \n\nthis  Court’s  opinions  on  novel  or  significant \ninterpretations of FISA is insupportable. In fact, a \npublic accounting of this Court’s legal analysis would \nserve governmental interests by clarifying the scope of \nthe government’s surveillance powers and the legal \nreasoning supporting them. See, e.g., Nakashima & \nLeonnig,  supra  (quoting  current  and  former \ngovernment officials advocating for release of original \nFISC  bulk-collection  opinion).  Even  the  General \nCounsel of the ODNI has recognized the importance of \npublicly discussing the legal framework under which \nthe government conducts its surveillance programs \nand  of  “demystify[ing]  and  correct[ing] \nmisimpressions”  the  public  may  have  about  the \ngovernment’s surveillance activities. ODNI, General \nCounsel Robert Litt’s as Prepared Remarks on Signals \nIntelligence Reform, IC on the Record (Feb. 4, 2015), \nhttp://bit.ly/2e2J1OM. \nOf course, portions of the Court’s opinions may be \nsealed to serve compelling governmental interests—\nfor  example,  to  protect  intelligence  sources  and \nmethods that have not been previously disclosed—but \nthe  First  Amendment  requires  the  Court  itself  to \nensure that any redactions are narrowly tailored to \nserve that interest. Cf. Pepsico, Inc. v. Redmond, 46 \nF.3d 29, 31 (7th Cir. 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (“The \njudge must make his own decision about what should \nbe confidential . . . and what may be spoken of openly. \nI regret that this means extra work for the judge, but \npreserving  the  principle  that  judicial  opinions  are \navailable to the public is worth at least that much \nsacrifice.”);  Nakashima  &  Leonnig,  supra  (quoting \nformer senior DOJ attorney Kenneth Wainstein as \narguing  that  “[e]specially  when  it  comes  to  legal \ndecisions about big programs, . . . we can talk about \n37a \n\nthem in a sanitized way without disclosing sources \nand  methods”).  This  Court  itself  has  rejected  the \ngovernment’s  overbroad  classification  claims  in \nreleasing opinions in the past.  See Declassification \nOrder at 6–7, In re Section 215 Orders. Important to \nthe analysis here will be the numerous disclosures \nmade  to  date,  which  provide  critical  context  for \nassessing  any  claim  that  disclosure  of  the  rulings \nsought here would harm the government’s interests. \nSee, e.g., Merrill v. Lynch, 151 F. Supp. 3d 342, 350 \n(S.D.N.Y.  2015)  (ordering  release  of  details  of \nchallenged  national-security  letter  and  relying \nheavily  on  previous  disclosures  to  find  that  the \ngovernment had “not demonstrated a good reason” to \nexpect harm would arise as a result of the ordered \nrelease); Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 78 (D. \nConn. 2005) (relying in part on “the nature and extent \nof information about the [national-security letter] that \nhas  already  been  disclosed  by  the  defendants”  in \ndetermining  that  “the  government  has  not \ndemonstrated  a  compelling  interest  in  preventing \ndisclosure of the recipient’s identity”). \nIII.  THE COURT SHOULD ORDER \nDECLASSIFICATION REVIEW UNDER \nRULE 62 AND APPLY THE FIRST \nAMENDMENT STANDARD TO ANY \nPROPOSED SEALING BY THE \nGOVERNMENT. \nIn implementing the constitutional right of access \nto  opinions  concerning  novel  or  significant \ninterpretations of law, the Court should first order the \ngovernment to conduct a declassification review of the \nopinions pursuant to FISC Rule 62(a). See, e.g., In re \nSection  215  Orders,  2013  WL  5460064,  at  *7; \n38a \n\nDeclassification Order at 5–7, In re Section 215 Orders \n(discussing  FISC  judge’s  review  of  proposed \nredactions); Order, In re Application of the FBI for an \nOrder Requiring the Production of Tangible Things \nfrom [Redacted], No. BR 13-109 (FISC Aug. 23, 2013), \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%2\n013-109%20Order-2.pdf  (discussing  sua  sponte \nrequest  by  FISC  judge  to  publish  memorandum \nopinion  under  FISC  R.P.  62(a));  In  re  Directives \n[Redacted] Pursuant to Section 105B of the Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Act,  551  F.3d  1004,  1016 \n(FISCR 2008). \nIf,  after  the  completion  of  that  review,  the \ngovernment proposes to redact any information in the \nCourt’s  opinions,  the  Court  should  set  a  briefing \nschedule, requiring the government to justify how its \nsealing request meets the constitutional standard set \nout  above,  and  allowing  the  ACLU  to  contest  any \nsealing  it  believes  to  be  unjustified.  Although  the \nCourt  should  give  due  consideration  to  the \ngovernment’s  predictive  judgments  of  harm  to \nnational security, it should not simply defer to those \njudgments  or  to  the  results  of  the  government’s \ndeclassification review. See, e.g., In re Wash. Post, 807 \nF.2d at 392. The First Amendment right of access is a \nconstitutional right that belongs to the public, and \nthat right can be overcome only upon specific findings \nby a court, including a finding that disclosure would \nrisk a substantial probability of harm to a compelling \ninterest. See supra Part II.B.23 \n                                            \n23 In evaluating the government’s declassification review of \nFISC opinions in response to the ACLU’s prior motion in this \nCourt,  the  Court  noted  that  the  government’s  proposed \nredactions  “passe[d]  muster”  under  the  First  Amendment \nstandard, even while declining to reach the ultimate question \n39a \n\nIndependent  judicial  review  of  any  proposed \nredactions  from  this  Court’s  opinions  is  necessary \nbecause—as  was  made  clear  in  In  re  Section  215 \nOrders when the ACLU moved this Court for public \naccess  to  other  FISC opinions—the  standards that \njustify classification do not always satisfy the strict \nconstitutional  standard,  and  because  executive-\nbranch  decisions  cannot  substitute  for  the  judicial \ndetermination  required  by  the  First  Amendment. \nDeclassification  Order  at  10–11,  In  re  Section  215 \nOrders (applying First Amendment standard to this \nCourt’s review of the government’s second redaction \nproposal). Specifically, information may be classified \non a simple determination by the executive branch \nthat “the unauthorized disclosure of [the information] \nreasonably could be expected to cause damage to the \nnational security.” Exec. Order No. 13,526, 75 Fed. \nReg. 707, § 1.2(a) (Dec. 29, 2009) (emphasis added). \nThe First Amendment, however, can be overcome only \nupon a showing of a “substantial probability” of harm, \na standard that the Supreme Court has specifically \nheld  to  be  more  stringent  than  a  “reasonable \nlikelihood”  test.  Press-Enter.  II,  478  U.S.  at  14. \nMoreover,  under  the  classification  regime,  the \nexecutive branch alone decides whether to consider \nthe public’s interest in disclosure, and it does so only \nin “exceptional cases.” Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 3.1(d). \nApplying that standard to judicial records would flatly \ncontradict the First Amendment right of access, which \npresumes that the public’s interest is in disclosure, \nand permits sealing only if there are no less-restrictive \n                                            \nwhether  the  First  Amendment  right  of  access  applied.  See \nDeclassification Order at 9, n.10, In re Section 215 Orders. \n40a \n\nalternatives and if the limitation on access is narrowly \ntailored. \nIndeed, judicial intervention in and oversight of \ngovernment declassification of sealed judicial opinions \nhas led  to  the  release of additional information to \nwhich the public was entitled. In In re Section 215 \nOrders,  after  this  Court  ordered  a  declassification \nreview of a FISC opinion, the government determined \nthat the opinion should be “withheld in full,” but the \nFISC judge demanded “a detailed explanation” of why \nthe opinion could not be released in redacted form. \nOrder, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISC \nNov. 20, 2013), http://1.usa.gov/258tRH8. In response, \nthe  government  agreed  to  release  the  opinion  in \nredacted form, but it took multiple proposals before \nthis  Court  was  satisfied  that  all  redactions  were \nsufficiently narrowly tailored. Declassification Order \nat  5–7,  In  re  Section  215  Orders  (describing  this \nCourt’s  back-and-forth  with  the  government  on \nproposed redactions to the opinion). Similarly, careful \njudicial review of redactions in other cases has led to \ngreater  disclosure  than  the  government  initially \nproposed. See, e.g., Order, In re Directives Pursuant to \n§ 105B of FISA, No. 105B(g) 07-01 (FISC Feb. 5, 2016), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/1OIbC1C (ordering the government to \nrespond to FISC judge’s concerns “about the scope of \ncertain proposed redactions” in response to an earlier \norder  to  conduct  a  declassification  review  of \ndocuments filed in the case). \nFurthermore, whether the public’s constitutional \nright of access is outweighed by a compelling interest \nin continued sealing is a question for the courts, not \none that rests with the executive. See Press-Enter. II, \n478 U.S. at 13–14. As the Fourth Circuit has forcefully \nexplained,  \n41a \n\n[T]roubled  as  we  are  by  the  risk  that \ndisclosure of classified information could \nendanger  the  lives  of  both  Americans \nand  their  foreign  informants,  we  are \nequally troubled by the notion that the \njudiciary  should  abdicate  its \ndecisionmaking  responsibility  to  the \nexecutive  branch  whenever  national \nsecurity  concerns  are  present.  History \nteaches us how easily the spectre of a \nthreat to “national security” may be used \nto  justify  a  wide  variety  of  repressive \ngovernment actions. A blind acceptance \nby  the  courts  of  the  government’s \ninsistence  on  the  need  for  secrecy, \nwithout  notice  to  others,  without \nargument, and without a statement of \nreasons,  would  impermissibly \ncompromise  the  independence  of  the \njudiciary and open the door to possible \nabuse. \nIn re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 391–92; see United States \nv. Hershey, 20 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A. 1985) (“[E]ven \nwhen the interest sought to be protected is national \nsecurity,  the  Government  must  demonstrate  a \ncompelling need to exclude the public . . . .” (emphasis \nomitted)); United States v. Grunden, 2 M.J. 116, 122 \n(C.M.A. 1977) (although classification and the policy \ndeterminations it involves “are not normal judicial \nfunctions, immunization from judicial review cannot \nbe  countenanced  in  situations  where  strong \ncountervailing constitutional interests exist”). \nIn other contexts, too, courts routinely scrutinize \nexecutive-branch classifications. See, e.g., Campbell v. \nDOJ, 164 F.3d 20, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Goldberg v. \n42a \n\nDOS, 818 F.2d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1987). This principle \nis  not  controversial,  and  in  other  forums,  the \ngovernment has expressly accepted it. See, e.g., Final \nReply Br. for Appellants at 8 n.1, Ctr. for Int’l Envtl. \nLaw v. Office of the U.S. Trade Rep., No. 12-5136 (D.C. \nCir. Nov. 27, 2012), 2012 WL 5940305 (clarifying that \nthe  government  has  not  “suggested  that  the \nExecutive’s  determination  that  a  document  is \nclassified should be conclusive or unreviewable”). \nFor these reasons, merely ordering discretionary \nrelease  under  Rule  62(a)  after  executive \ndeclassification  review  would  not  satisfy  the \nconstitutional right of access. The Court should thus \norder declassification review as a first step and then \ntest any sealing proposed by the government against \nthe standard required by the First Amendment. Of \ncourse,  even  if  the  Court  holds  that  the  First \nAmendment right of access does not attach to the legal \nopinions requested by Movant, it should nonetheless \nexercise its discretion—as it has in the past and in the \npublic interest—to order the government to conduct a \ndeclassification  review  of  its  opinions  pursuant  to \nRule 62. See, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL \n5460064, at *7. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Movant  respectfully \nrequests that this Court unseal its opinions and orders \ncontaining novel or significant interpretations of law, \nincluding but not limited to those described in the \nAppendix,  with  only  those  limited  redactions  that \nsatisfy the strict test to overcome the constitutional \nright of access. \n \nDated: October 18, 2016 \n43a \n\nAPPENDIX  Undisclosed Opinions and Orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  Issued Between September 11, 2001, and June 2, 2015           Date       Subject of                 Source                                                         I              Identifying                                         Description                          Opinions               Opinions or                          or Orders                                                              Orders    1   2015  Authorizing bulk  Charlie Savage &      “A system intended to scan emails for child pornog -searches of             Nicole Perlroth,         raphy and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court  incoming Yahoo!     order requiring it to search for messages containing  Yahoo Said to Haveemail for a                   a computer ‘signature’ tied to the communications of Aided U.S. Emailcomputer                 a state-sponsored terrorist organization. . . .” Surveillance by         “signature”                      Adapting Spampursuant to FISA  , N.Y.

Collyer, Judge) dismissed a motion filed \nby the American Civil Liberties Union, the American \nCivil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia1, and \nthe  Media  Freedom  and  Information  Access  Clinic \n \n(jointly, the “Movants”)2 for  the  release  of  certain \nopinions and orders by the FISC addressing the bulk \ncollection  of  data3  under  the  Foreign  Intelligence \n \nSurveillance  Act  (“FISA”).4 In  a  thoughtful  and \ncareful opinion, the FISC rejected the Movants’ claim \nthat the withholding of redacted, non-public material \nclassified  by  the  Executive  Branch  violates  the \nMovants’ First Amendment  right of public access.5 \nThe Movants now seek to appeal that decision to our \nCourt  in  the  form  of  a  Petition  for  Review  (the \n“Petition”);  in  the  alternative,  they  seek  a  Writ  of \nMandamus. \n                                            \n1 The name that was used in the FISC was the “American Civil \nLiberties Union of the Nation’s Capital.” \n2 Although the parties filing the Petition for Review or, in the \nalternative, for a Writ of Mandamus are technically “Petitioners” \nbefore this Court, we will refer to them as “Movants” throughout \nthis opinion to ensure uniformity and consistency with our earlier \nopinions and orders on this matter. \n3 See In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk \nCollection of Data Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct (“In re Bulk Collection”), No. Misc. 13-08, 2020 WL 897659, \nat *l, *16 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. Feb. 11, 2020). \n4 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801–1885c. \n5 See In re Bulk Collection, 2020 WL 897659, at *7–16. \n64a \n\nFor  the  reasons  stated  below,  we  decline  to \nconsider  the  merits  of  the  Movants’  Petition  and \nDISMISS the Petition for lack of jurisdiction. \nBACKGROUND \nOn November 7, 2013, the Movants filed a motion \nseeking disclosure of the FISC’s opinions addressing \nthe Government’s bulk collection of data under the \nFISA (the “Motion”). The Government identified four \nsuch opinions. Two of the opinions had been made \npublic  in  redacted  form  by  the  FISC  prior  to  the \n \nMovants’  Motion.6 The  other  two  opinions  were \nreleased subsequently,  also in redacted form, by the \n \nGovernment.7 The material that has been redacted in \nthese  four  opinions  consists  of  highly  sensitive \ninformation that, following a declassification review, \nthe  Executive  Branch  concluded  remains  classified \nand, if released, could be damaging to our country’s \nnational     security.8 \nOn  January  25,  2017,  then-Presiding  Judge \nRosemary  M.  Collyer  dismissed  the  Motion on the \nbasis that the Movants lacked standing under Article \nIII of the Constitution to seek public disclosure of the \n \nredacted, classified material in the FISC opinions.9On \nNovember  9,  2017,  the  FISC,  sitting  en  banc, \n                                            \n6 See id. at *l. \n7 See id. at *2. \n8 See id. at *l. \n9 See In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk \nCollection of Data Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591 (Foreign Intel.

Because  federal  courts  have  an  independent \nduty to ensure that jurisdiction exists at all stages of \na case, and because we must determine that we have \njurisdiction  before  proceeding  to  the  merits  of  a \nclaim,24 we first address our own authority to consider \nthe Movants’ Petition. \nI. \nAt the crux of the instant appeal is the question of \nwhether  we  have  been  authorized  by  Congress  to \nreview the Movants’ First Amendment claim. In other \nwords, we must decide whether the Movants’ Petition \nfalls within the class of cases carefully delineated by \nthe  FISA  as  within  our  authority  as  a  court  of \nappellate review. We conclude that it does not. \nWe begin by recognizing the well-settled principle  \nthat Congress has the exclusive authority to invest all \ncourts inferior to the Supreme Court “with jurisdiction \n.  .  .  in  the  exact  degrees  and  character  which  to \n \nCongress may seem proper for the public good.”25 As \n                                            \n22 Id. \n23 Eberhart v.

In comparison with other \nfederal courts, the nature of the FISC’s work is strictly \nlimited in scope. The FISC is tasked primarily with \n“reviewing  applications  for  surveillance  and  other \ninvestigative activities relating to foreign intelligence \n \ncollection.”29 Equally limited, if not more so, is the \nwork of our Court of Review, which, like the FISC, is \n“a unique court” within the federal judiciary and  our \nsystem of government.30 \n                                            \n26 Id. \n27 DaimlerChrysler Corp. v.

Generally, \nthe statute provides for the creation of “a court of \nreview  which  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  review  the \ndenial of any application made under this chapter [36 \n \nof  Title  50  of  the  United  States  Code].31 More \nspecifically,  the statute provides  that  the  Court  of \nReview “shall have jurisdiction to consider” a petition \nfor review of a decision by the FISC32 on: (1) a FISA \n \n“production”  or  “nondisclosure  order”;33 (2) \n                                            \n31 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b). \n32 Id. § 1861(f)(3) (jurisdictional provision for appellate review \nof FISA production and nondisclosure orders); id. § 1881a(i)(6)(A) \n(jurisdictional provision for appellate review of a FISA directive); \nid.  §  1881a(j)(4)(A)  (jurisdictional  provision  for      appellate   \nreview of   FISA certifications and procedures); id. § 1881b(f)(1) \n(jurisdictional  provision  for  appellate  review  of  an  order \napproving the targeting of a United States person reasonably \nbelieved  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States  for  the \nacquisition of foreign intelligence information utilizing means \nthat constitute electronic surveillance or the acquisition of stored \nelectronic data that requires an order under [Chapter 36 of Title \n50],  and  conducted  in  the  United  States);  id.  §  1881c(e)(1) \n(jurisdictional  provision  for  appellate  review  of  an  order \napproving the targeting of a United States person reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States for acquisitions \nof foreign intelligence information utilizing other means). \n33 A “production order” is “an order to produce any tangible \nthing[, such as books, records, papers, and other items] under \n[§ 1861],” which governs the access to certain business records \nfor  foreign  intelligence  and  international  terrorism \ninvestigations. Id. § 1861(f)(1)(A). A “nondisclosure order” is “an \norder imposed under [§ 1861(d)]” to prohibit the disclosure that \nthe Government has sought or obtained tangible things pursuant \nto, for example, a production order. Id. § 1861(f)(1)(B). We note, \nhowever, that many of the provisions in § 1861, including those \nauthorizing judicial review and nondisclosure orders, are no \n71a \n\n“directives” issued in writing by the Attorney General \nand  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  to  an \n \n“electronic  communication  service  provider”;34 (3) \norders  approving  the  “certification”  and  the \n“targeting,  minimization,  and  querying  procedures” \nfor  “acquisitions”  of  non-United  States  persons \nabroad;35 and (4) orders approving the targeting of \nUnited  States  persons  abroad  to  acquire  foreign \n \nintelligence information.36 The FISA also authorizes \nour consideration of questions of law that are certified \nby the FISC in certain circumstances.37 \n                                            \nlonger effective, as they were subject to certain amendments that \nCongress allowed to expire on March 15, 2020. As a result, § 1861 \nnow reads as it read on October 25, 2001. See Pub. L. 116–69, \nDiv.  B,  Title  VII,  §  1703(a),  Nov.  21,  2019,  133  Stat.  1143 \n(providing  that,  effective  March  15,  2020,  with  certain \nexceptions, this  section was amended to read  as it read  on \nOctober 25, 2001). \n34 A “directive” refers to a governmental instruction provided in \nwriting  to  an  electronic  communication  service  provider  to \nundertake certain actions relating to the acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information under § 1881a(a). See id. § 1881a(i)(1). \nAnd an “electronic communication service provider” refers to a \n“telecommunications  carrier,”  “a  provider  of  electronic \ncommunication  service,”  “a  provider  of  a  remote  computing \nservice,” “any other communication service provider who has \naccess  to  wire  or  electronic  communications  either  as  such \ncommunications are transmitted or as such communications are \nstored,” or “an officer, employee, or agent” of the aforementioned \nentities.

It makes clear, for example, that the \nGovernment may file a petition for review of a decision \nor order by the FISC with respect to each of the four \nenumerated categories mentioned above.38 In addition \nto the Government, the  FISA also authorizes  “any \nperson  receiving’’  a  production  or  nondisclosure \n“order” (i.e., the first enumerated category),39 as well \nas  an  “electronic  communication  service  provider” \nreceiving  a “directive”  (i.e., the second  enumerated \ncategory),40  to file  a petition for review. \nThere  can  be  no  question  that  the  Movants’ \nPetition does not fall within any of the categories of \njurisdiction enumerated above. By the same token, it \nis equally clear that the Movants are not one of the \npetitioners  authorized  by  Congress  to  seek  review \nbefore our Court. Instead, the Movants simply assert \na  constitutional  violation  with  respect  to  the \nwithholding  of  information  that  the  Executive  has \ndeemed  classified  and  that  is  contained  in  FISC \nopinions in closed cases-cases in which the Movants \nwere not a party. Although Congress has empowered \nmost other federal courts to consider claims arising \n                                            \ndetermines  warrants  such  review  because  of  a  need  for \nuniformity or because consideration by [us] would serve the \ninterests of justice”). \n38 See ante, note 32. \n39 Id. § 1861(f)(3). A “person” is defined as “any individual, \nincluding any officer or employee of the Federal Government, or \nany group, entity, association, corporation, or foreign power.” Id. \n§ 1801(m). \n40 Id. § 1881a(i)(6)(A). \n73a \n\nunder the federal Constitution,41 such as the Movants’ \nFirst Amendment claim, Congress did not do so here, \nand, we are not aware of any statutory basis that can \nsupport our jurisdiction over the Movants’  putative \nappeal. \nB. \nThe  Movants  contend  that  the  statute  that \nestablishes our Court, 50 U.S.C.  § 1803(b), gives  us \njurisdiction  over  their  Petition.  That  statute \nprovides, in relevant part, that “[t]he Chief Justice [of \nthe  United  States]  shall  publicly  designate  three \njudges,  one of whom shall be publicly designated as \nthe presiding judge, . . . who together shall comprise a \ncourt of review which shall have jurisdiction to review \nthe  denial  of  any  application  made  under  this \n \nchapter.”42The Movants assert that their Motion is an \n“application” that “arose under ‘this chapter’ because \nthe  FISC  was  created  by,  and  issues  opinions \n \npursuant to authority it receives from, the [FISA].”43\nThe Movants misread the provision. \n1. \nThe phrase “application made under this chapter” \nin § 1803(b) generally refers to an application made by \nthe Government ex parte and in camera for foreign \nintelligence surveillance. We reach this conclusion for \nat least four reasons. \nFirst, because  we are a court of review, the term \n“application”  in § 1803(b) must be construed in light \nof how the same term is used in the provision that \n                                            \n41 See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n42 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b) (emphasis added). \n43 Movants’ Br. at 3. \n74a \n\nestablishes the court that denies the applications that \nwe  are  authorized  to  review.  Section  1803(a)(1) \nprovides for the creation of the FISC and states in \nrelevant part that the FISC “shall have jurisdiction to \nhear  applications  for  and  grant  orders  approving \n \nelectronic  surveillance.”44 Section  1803(a)(1)  also \nmakes clear that if the FISC “denies an application for \nan order authorizing electronic surveillance under this \nchapter,”  the  FISC  “shall  provide  immediately  for \nthe record a written statement of each reason for [its] \ndecision  and, on motion of  the United  States, the \nrecord shall be transmitted, under seal, to the court of \nreview established in subsection (b).”45 \nBecause § 1803(b) refers to the “review [of] the \n \ndenial of any application under this chapter”46and the \nFISC is authorized to deny the application in the first \ninstance, it follows that our court has jurisdiction  to \nreview the denial of those applications that the FISC \nhas the authority to deny under § 1803(a)47—namely, \n \nan  application  for  “surveillance.”48 After  all,  the \n                                            \n44 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)(1). \n45 Id. (emphasis added). \n46 Id. § 1803(b). \n47 As the Movants concede, the FISC did not rely on any FISA \nprovision to establish its own jurisdiction over the Motion. To the \ncontrary, the FISC noted that the “Movants’ First Amendment \nright of access claim falls outside the jurisdictional provisions” of \nthe FISA, including § 1803(a)(1). In re Bulk Collection, 2020 WL \n897659,  at  *3  (relying  instead  on  the  doctrine  of  ancillary \njurisdiction). \n48 By “surveillance,” we do not refer exclusively to “electronic \nsurveillance,” but also to the various investigative techniques \nauthorized under the FISA, including “physical searches.” In \nother words, we use the term “surveillance “in the same manner \nas it is used to identify chapter 36 of Title 50 of the United States \n75a \n\n“chapter” to which § 1803(b) refers is chapter 36 of \nTitle 50 of the United States Code, which is entitled \n“Foreign Intelligence Surveillance.”  \nSecond, as the text of § 1803(b) makes clear, our \nCourt can only review the “denial,” not the grant, of \nan  “application.”49  That  limited  authorization \nreinforces our conclusion that the term “application”  \nrefers to applications for surveillance, and not to any \nrequest  for  relief relating  to  the  FISC.  Indeed, \nCongress’s reason for authorizing review only in cases \nwhere an “application” is denied by the FISC is clear \nfrom  the  text  and  structure  of  the  statute: \napplications are made ex parte and in camera by the \nGovernment. As a result, only the Government would \nhave the statutory right  to appeal its denial. If  the \napplication  were granted,  the  Government  would \nhave nothing to appeal. \nThird, the use of the term “application” in another \nsubparagraph  of  §  1803,  which  authorizes  the \nappointment  of  an  “amicus  curiae,”  further \ndemonstrates that the term “application” refers to an \napplication for surveillance under the FISA. Section \n1803(i)(2)(A)  requires  the  designation  of  “an \nindividual  . . . to serve as amicus curiae to assist . . . \nin the consideration of any application for an order or \nreview that, in the opinion of the [FISC or this Court], \npresents  a novel or significant interpretation of the \nlaw, unless the [FISC or this Court] issues a finding \nthat such appointment is not appropriate.”50 In other \nwords,  the  FISA  requires  the  appointment  of  an \n                                            \nCode. \n49 50 U.S.C. § 1803(b). \n50 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2)(A) (emphasis added). \n76a \n\namicus  or  a  finding  that  the  appointment  is  not \nappropriate  only  where  there is: (1) an “application \nfor an order” or an “application for ... review,” (2) that \n“presents a novel or significant interpretation of  the \nlaw.”51 \nSection 1803(i)(2)(A) is premised on the principle \nthat, since the litigation involving an “application” for \nelectronic surveillance is ex parte, the FISC and this \nCourt  could  benefit  from  having  someone  who  can \nprovide  an  independent  comment  on  the \nGovernment’s  asserted  interest  in  intelligence \ncollection. Accordingly,  that  principle—namely, that \nhaving an amicus could be beneficial in light of the ex \nparte  character  of  an  application  for  electronic \nsurveillance-further reinforces our conclusion that the \nterm “application” in § 1803 refers to an application \nfor surveillance, and not just any request for relief \n \nrelating to the FISC.52 If the FISC or this Court needs \nassistance from an amicus in resolving an issue of law \nthat does not involve an “application” for surveillance, \nthat  designation  could  be    made  pursuant  to  § \n1803(i)(2)(B)’s authorization  to  appoint  an  amicus \n“in any instance [that the FISC or this Court] deems \n                                            \n51 Id. Such “application for an order or review” could include, \nfor  example,  the  Government’s  efforts  to  secure  an  order \napproving  the  targeting  of  United  States  persons  abroad  to \nacquire foreign intelligence information, see id. §§ 1881b, 188lc, \nor  to  obtain  the  review  and  approval  of  “certification”  and \n“procedures’’  for  “acquisitions”  of  non-United  States  persons \nabroad, id. § 1881a. \n52 For this same reason, the Movants’ argument that we are \nrequired under § 1803(i)(2)(A) to designate an individual or \norganization to serve as amicus curiae in this case, see Movants’ \nBr. at 2 n.1, lacks merit. Because the Movants’ Petition is not an \n“application” subject to our review, the mandatory-appointment \nrequirement of § 1803(i)(2)(A) is not triggered here. \n77a \n\nappropriate or, upon motion,” regardless  of whether \nit involves an “application” or not.53 \nFourth,  the  term  “application”  is  used  in  other \nsections in chapter 36 also to refer to ex parte and in \ncamera  applications  made  by  the  Government  for \nsurveillance.  For  instance,  §  1804  describes  the \nGovernment’s applications for an order by the FISC \n \napproving  electronic  surveillance.54 And  §  1823 \ndescribes the Government’s applications for an order \nby the FISC approving physical searches.55 \n                                            \n53 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2)(B). Our earlier designation of Professor \nLaura Donahue as amicus curiae in the case that certified the \nquestion of the Movants’ Article III standing—a fact relied on by \nthe Movants in their brief, see Movants’ Br. at 2 n.1 (citing Order \nat 2, In re Certification, FISCR No. 18-01 (Foreign Intel. Surv. \nCt. of Rev. Jan. 9, 2018))—is consistent with our interpretation \nof the text. That designation was made pursuant to § 1803(i), \nwhich  includes  the  discretionary  appointment  provision  in \n§ 1803(i)(2)(B). \nWe  acknowledge  that  the  FISC  invoked§  1803(i)(2)(A)  to \nappoint Professor Donahue to assist in its disposition of the \nMovants’ Motion, see Order at 2, In re Bulk Collection, No. Misc. \n13–08 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. May 1, 2018). That single citation \nof § 1803(i)(2)(A), however, does not undermine our foregoing \nanalysis of the text and structure of the FISA. To be sure, the \ncitation was likely inadvertent in light of the fact that the FISC \ndid not conclude that the Movants’ Motion was an “application” \nfor purposes of § 1803 and, instead, relied on the doctrine of \nancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the Movants’ \nclaim. And, to be sure, the same appointment could have been \nmade by the FISC pursuant to § 1803(i)(2)(B), so there was \nnothing  improper  about  the  FISC’s  designation  of  Professor \nDonahue in that instance. \n54 See 50 U.S.C. § 1804 (entitled “Applications for Court Orders” \nrelating to electronic surveillance). \n55 See id. § 1823 (entitled “Application for Court Order” relating \nto physical searches). \n78a \n\n2. \nBy  contrast,  the  Movants’  reading  of  §  1803(b) \nproduces at least three untenable consequences. First, \nunder  the  Movants’  reading,  the  Court  of  Review \nwould be empowered to review rulings on the merits \nthat the FISC would not be empowered to make. The \nMovants  argue  that  although  the  statute  that \nestablishes  the  FISC,  §  1803(a)(1),  authorizes  that \ncourt  to  adjudicate  only  applications  for  electronic \nsurveillance, the statute that establishes this Court, § \n1803(b), authorizes our review of any request for relief \n \nthat relates to the FISC or the FISA.56In other words, \nthe Movants suggest that while the FISA authorizes \nthe FISC to undertake the limited task of considering \napplications for surveillance, the FISA authorizes our \nCourt to undertake the comparatively broader task of \nreviewing the denial of any request for relief relating \nto the FISC or the FISA—including a request that the \nFISC  would  lack  the  statutory  authority  to  deny, \nwhatever  the  request  may  be.  This  creates  an \nanomalous situation: our reviewing authority under \nthe  FISA  would  exceed  the  FISC’s  adjudicatory \nauthority under the same statute, turning our court \ninto something more than just a specialized court of \nreview. \nSecond,  under  the  Movants’  reading,  other \nprovisions in § 1803 would be rendered meaningless. \nFor example, the FISA requires an amicus designated \n                                            \n56 See Movants’ Br. at 3 (noting that the statute specifying the \nFISC’s  jurisdiction  refers  to  “applications  for  electronic \nsurveillance,”  whereas  the  statute  specifying  the  Court  of \nReview’s jurisdiction refers to “any application” made under the \nFISA, which includes a request for “access to FISC opinions” \ngiven  that  the  “FISC  was  created  by,  and  issues  opinions \npursuant to authority it receives from, the [FISA]”). \n79a \n\nby the FISC or our Court to have access to “any legal \nprecedent, application, certification, petition, motion, \nor such other materials that the court determines are \n \nrelevant to the duties of the amicus curiae.”57 If the \nMovants’ Motion  to the FISC or the Petition to our \nCourt were considered  an “application” for purposes \nof § 1803, as the Movants contend, then Congress \nwould not have identified the term “ application” as a \nseparate category from other terms like “petition” or \n“motion.” Only by interpreting the term “application” \nas we do, could terms like “petition” and “motion” \npreserve their ordinary meaning. \nThird, under the Movants’ reading, some, if not all, \nof  the  specific  jurisdictional  bases  provided  in  the \nFISA  also  would  be  rendered  meaningless  or \nsuperfluous. In fact, it would make little sense for \nCongress  to  carefully  delineate  specific  types  of \ndecisions  that  could  be  appealed  by  carefully \ndelineated parties—as it did in sections 1861, 1881a, \n1881b, and 1881c58—if any other person could appeal \nthe denial of any request that relates to the FISC or \nthe FISA. \nC. \nThe Movants also argue that “Article III appellate \ncourts  [have]  fashioned  multiple  procedural \nmechanisms  for  non-parties  to  assert  their \nconstitutional access right in the first instance and to \n \nlater  obtain  appellate  review.”59 One  of  those \n                                            \n57 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(6)(A)(i). \n58 See ante, note 32. \n59  Movants’  Br.  at  5  (identifying  “direct  intervention,” \n“collateral  order  doctrine,”  and  the  “writ  of  mandamus”  as \nexamples of procedural mechanisms used to consider claims for \n80a \n\nmechanisms is the “collateral order doctrine, which \nhas supplied authority to entertain appeals in other \n \npublic access cases in the federal appellate courts.”60In \nthose  cases, the doctrine was invoked to review an \ninterlocutory  order  disposing  of  an  important \ncollateral  issue  prior  to  the  final  resolution  of  the \ncase—e.g., access to  records in an ongoing  criminal \ncase.61 \nThat  doctrine  has  no  application  here.  Among \nother  things,  there  is  no  question  that  the  non-\nspecialized federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction \nover appeals of final and interlocutory decisions by \n \ndistrict courts,62 which are, in turn, empowered to \nconsider claims arising under the First Amendment to \n \nthe  Constitution.63 That  is  not  true  of  specialized \ncourts like  the FISC or our  Court.64 The  collateral \norder  doctrine,  or  any  other  judicially-created \nprocedural  mechanism,  cannot  be  used  to \n                                            \naccess to records in criminal cases) (collecting cases). \n60 Id. at 4 (collecting cases). \n61 See, e.g., In re N.Y. Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 1987) \n(explaining  that  the  collateral  order  doctrine  applied  “since \ndeferral of a ruling on appellants’ claims until a final judgment \nin  the  underlying  criminal  prosecution  is  entered  would \neffectively deny appellants much of the relief they seek, namely, \nprompt public disclosure of the motion papers”). \n62  See  28  U.S.C.  §  1291  (“Final  Decisions”),  id.  §  1292 \n(“Interlocutory Orders”). \n63 See id. § 1331 (“Federal-Question Jurisdiction”). \n64 Our Court is not a “court of appeals” for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1291, which is the subject of the collateral order doctrine. Cf. \n50 U.S.C. 1803(k)(1) (providing that the Court of Review is a \n“court  of  appeals”  for  purposes  of  28  U.S.C.  §  1254,  which \nauthorizes review of a case by the Supreme Court by writ of \ncertiorari or certification). \n81a \n\nmanufacture subject matter jurisdiction where none \nexists. \nII. \nTo salvage their Petition, the Movants invoke the \ncommon-law doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction as an \nalternative jurisdictional basis for our review of the \ndismissal of their Motion. Under that discretionary \ndoctrine,  “a  federal  court  may  exercise  ancillary \njurisdiction ‘(1) to permit disposition by a single court \nof claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, \nfactually interdependent; and (2) to enable a court to \nfunction  successfully,  that  is,  to  manage  its \nproceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its \n \ndecrees.”’65 This   “ancillary”  common-law  authority, \nwhile  not  necessarily  confirmed  or  conferred  by \n \nCongress,66is said to be inherent in the courts’ judicial \n  \npower  derived from Article III of the Constitution.67\nBut because this authority lacks an explicit statutory \nbasis and is therefore “shielded from direct democratic \ncontrols,” the Supreme Court repeatedly has warned \nthe  inferior  courts  that  this  authority  “must  be \n                                            \n65  Peacock  v.  Thomas,  516  U.S.  349,  354  (1996)  (quoting \nKokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379–80). \n66 To be sure, “Congress codified much of the common-law \ndoctrine  of  ancillary  jurisdiction  as  part  of’  supplemental \njurisdiction’ in 28 U.S.C. § 1367.” Peacock, 516 U.S. at 354 n.5. \n67 See United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. 32, 34 (1812) (“Certain \nimplied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice \nfrom the nature of their institution.”); accord Roadway Exp., Inc. \nv. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980) (“The inherent powers of \nfederal courts are those which ‘are necessary to the exercise of all \nothers.” (quoting Hudson, 11 U.S. at 34)); see also Chambers v. \nNASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 58 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting). \n82a \n\n \nexercised with restraint and  discretion,”68 and with \n“great caution.”69 \nIn the circumstances presented here, we decline to \nrely  on  any  “ancillary’’  authority  to  consider  the \nMovants’  Petition.  As  a  Court  of  Review  of \nsignificantly limited powers carefully delineated by \nCongress, we are especially reluctant—“cautio[us]” in \nthe admonition of the Supreme Court70—to consider \nissues beyond our jurisdictional competence on the \nbasis of a doctrine “that can hardly be criticized for \n \nbeing overly rigid or precise.”71 The Movants’ Petition \nsimply does not present a circumstance that warrants \nthe exercise of our discretionary, ancillary authority. \nThe Movants have not been haled into  court against \ntheir will, nor do  they seek  to assert  rights in an \n \nongoing action.72 Nor is this an instance in which the \napplication  of  our  inherent  judicial  power  is \nappropriate, let alone “necessary,” to enforce one of \n \nour  own  mandates  or  orders,73 or  to  protect  the \n                                            \n68 Roadway Exp., 447 U.S. at 764. \n69 Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. 529, 531 (1824). \n70 Id. \n71 Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379. \n72 Owen Equip. & Erection Co. v.

Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44–45 (explaining that among the \nvarious powers of a federal court is the power “to vacate its own \njudgment upon proof that a fraud has been perpetrated upon the \ncourt,” to “bar from the courtroom a criminal defendant who \ndisrupts a trial,” and “to fashion an appropriate sanction for \nconduct which abuses the judicial process” (collecting cases)). \n75 Movants’ Br. at 4. \n76 In re Bulk Collection, No. Misc. 13-08.  \n77 To clarify, we do not consider or decide here whether the \nMovants have a cause of action in a federal district court against \nan executive agency for the disclosure of the relevant non-public \nmaterial  that  the  Executive  Branch  has  determined  to  be \nclassified. We note that the Government has acknowledged that \nthe Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, may provide for \njudicial review of a claim seeking access to such material. See \nGovernment’s Br. at 10. \n84a \n\ncrux  of  the  Movants’  claim  to  disclosure  here  lies \nwithin the Executive’s clear authority to determine \nwhat material should remain classified, we recall the \nSupreme Court’s admonition  that “[b]ecause of their \nvery potency, inherent powers must be exercised with \nrestraint and discretion.”78 \nIn  the  absence  of  a  clear  grant  of  reviewing \nauthority in the FISA or a need to protect the integrity \nof  our  own  judicial  processes,  respect  for  the \nseparation  of  powers  dictates  that  we  dismiss  the \nPetition  for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  as  we  “have  no \nbusiness  deciding”  the  merits  of  the  Movants’ \nconstitutional claim.79 \nIII. \nPerhaps  recognizing  that  the  FISA  does  not \nauthorize their Petition for Review in this instance, \nthe Movants also characterize their Petition  as  one \nseeking, in the alternative, the extraordinary writ of \nmandamus.  This  alternative  effort  to  establish \njurisdiction fares no better. \nThe common-law writ of mandamus directed at a \nlower court is codified in the All Writs Act80and in our \n \nRules  of  Procedure.81 The  writ  is  “a  ‘drastic  and \nextraordinary’  remedy  ‘reserved  for  really \n                                            \n78 Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44 (citing Roadway Exp., 447 U.S. at \n764). \n79 Cuno, 547 U.S. at 341. \n80 “The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of \nCongress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of \ntheir respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and \nprinciples of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) (emphasis added). \n81 “All writs that may be issued by United States courts of \nappeals shall be available to the FISCR.” FISCR. Proc. 8. \n85a \n\n \nextraordinary  causes.”’82 And  “only  exceptional \ncircumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of \npower, or a clear abuse of discretion will  justify  the \ninvocation  of  this extraordinary  remedy”83for the \npurpose of confining a lower court “to a lawful exercise \nof its prescribed jurisdiction.”84 \nIn the nature of things, the writ is available only \nto assist an existing basis for jurisdiction. Indeed, “the \naction must . . . involve subject matter to which our \nappellate  jurisdiction  could  in  some  manner,  at \nsometime, attach,” and to which “the issuance of the \nwrit might assist.”85 The Movants recognize this point \nby conceding that the “All Writs Act does not provide \n‘an independent grant of appellate jurisdiction,”’ and \nthat “courts may only consider mandamus petitions if \n‘an  independent  statute  .  .  .  grants  [the  court] \n \njurisdiction.”’86 But as noted, the Movants have not \nidentified an independent basis  for subject matter \n \njurisdiction over their Petition.87 And our  Rules of \n                                            \n82 Cheney v.

See Movants’ Br. at 9. \nNeither  section  provides  an  independent  basis  for  subject \nmatter jurisdiction in this instance. Section 1803(g)(l), by its own \nterms, does not create subject matter jurisdiction over any kind \nof case, let alone over an action involving a party that has not \nreceived any FISA process. And § 1803(j) only authorizes the \nFISC to certify certain questions of law to our Court; it does not \ncreate an independent basis of reviewing authority over cases \nthat fall outside of our own subject matter jurisdiction. Even if it \ndid, the Movants have not relied upon the certification procedure \nin this case. To be sure, when we accepted the FISC’s certification \nrelating to the Movants’ Article III standing, we only agreed to \nanswer the question certified to us and specifically refused to \nconsider if there was subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion. \nSee In re Certification, 2018 WL 2709456, at *7. \n88 See ante, note 81. \n89 In re Opinions & Orders, 2017 WL 5983865, at *21 (Collyer, \n87a \n\n“governmental  electronic  surveillance  of \ncommunications for foreign intelligence purposes.”90 \nBecause the Movants’ Petition falls outside of the \nclass of cases that Congress carefully identified as \nbeing subject to our reviewing authority, the March \n10,  2020  Petition  is  DISMISSED  for  lack  of \njurisdiction. \n                                            \nP.J., dissenting). \n90 Clapper v.

In fact, however, the four opinions responsive to \nthe  Movants’  claim  have  never  been  subject  to  a \nsealing  order  issued  by  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (FISC).  Moreover, the Executive \nBranch has declassified those opinions in substantial \npart and each of them has been made public by the \nExecutive  Branch or the FISC. Consequently,  what \nthe Movants now seek is access to the redacted, non-\npublic material within those opinions, which remains \nclassified by the Executive Branch. \nI.  Procedural Background. \nThe  Movants  filed  the  pending  motion  on \nNovember 7, 2013, in the wake of widely publicized \ndisclosures about the bulk collection of data by the \nUnited  States  government  under  FISA.

The FISC, sitting en banc, reconsidered that \ndismissal  sua  sponte  and  issued  an  opinion  on \nNovember  9,  2017,  which  held  by  a  6-5  vote  that \nArticle Ill’s standing requirement was satisfied. In re \nOpinions & Orders  of  this  Court  Addressing  Bulk \nCollection  of  Data  Under  FISA, 2017  WL 5983865 \n(FISA Ct. Nov. 9, 2017) (en banc). The en banc FISC \nvacated the January 25, 2017 opinion and remanded \nthe  matter  to  the  undersigned  judge  for  further \nconsideration. Id at 9. \nOn January 5, 2018, however, the FISC certified \nthe question of Movants’ Article III standing to the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  of  Review \n(FISCR)  pursuant  to  50  U.S.C.  § 1803(j)  “because \nreview  by the  FISCR  would  serve  the interests  of \njustice,  a  dispositive  issue  about  standing  was \ninvolved, and the split among the FISC Judges was \nvery close and involved a difference of opinion about \nthe law to apply, among other considerations.” In re \nOpinions  &  Orders  of  this  Court  Addressing  Bulk \nCollection of Data Under FISA, 2018 WL 396244 at *1 \n(FISA  Ct.  Jan.  5,  2018).  The  FISCR  accepted  the \ncertification  on  January  9,  2018,  and  appointed \nProfessor  Laura  K.  Donohue  to  serve  as  amicus \ncuriae. In re Certification of Questions of Law to the \nFISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *1, 3 (FISA Ct. Rev. Jan. \n                                            \n1841(4), 1842(c)(3)). \n92a \n\n9, 2018) (per curiam). On March 16, 2018, the FISCR \nheld  that  the  Movants  meet  the  requirements  for \nstanding under Article Ill.  Id. at *4–7. The FISCR did \nnot  decide  whether  the  FISC  had  subject  matter \njurisdiction or reach the merits of Movants’ claim.

Appointment  of \nAmicus Curiae and Briefing Order, No. Misc. 13-08 \n(May  1,  2018).  The  Court  is  grateful  to  Professor \nDonohue for her able assistance. \nThe Court has fully considered the submissions of \nthe parties and amicus. For the reasons stated below, \nthe  Court  finds  that  (1)  it  has  subject  matter \njurisdiction over the Motion for the Release of Court \nRecords; and (2) the First Amendment does not confer \na qualified right of public access to the material sought \nby the Movants, nor is there reason for the Court to \nexercise any discretion it may have to grant the relief \nrequested.  The  Motion  for  the  Release  of Court \nRecords accordingly will be denied and the motion will \nbe dismissed. \nII.  THE COURT HAS SUBJECT MATTER \nJURISDICTION OVER THE MOVANTS’ \nCLAIM. \n“Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  \nThey  possess  only  that  power  authorized  by \nConstitution and statute, which is not to be expanded \nby judicial decree. It is to be presumed  that a cause \nlies  outside  this  limited  jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen  v. \nGuardian  Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377 \n93a \n\n(1994) (citations omitted). The FISC is a federal court \nwith specialized jurisdiction concerning applications \nand certifications filed by the government and related \nto  the  collection  of  foreign  intelligence.  50  U.S.C. \n§§ 1803(a)(1),  1822  (c),  1842(b)(1)  and  (d)(1), \n1861(b)(1)(A) and (c)(1), 1881a(i), 1881b(a), 1881c(a), \nand 1881d(a). \nAlthough  Movants’  First  Amendment  right  of \naccess claim falls outside the jurisdictional provisions \nnoted above, Movants assert that the FISC has subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the claim  pursuant  to the \nFISC’s inherent authority over its own records and as \nancillary to its jurisdiction over the applications and \nproceedings which resulted in the opinions to which \nMovants seek access. See Movants’ Opening Brief in \nResponse to the Court’s Order of May 1, 2018 at 4–12 \n(“Movants’ Br.”). Amicus asserts that adjudication of \nthe Movants’ claim is within the “essential inherent \npower” conferred by Article III of the Constitution. See \nBrief of Amicus Curiae at 18–24 (“Amicus Br.”). The \ngovernment argues that the FISC has no jurisdiction \nto adjudicate Movants’ claim because it falls outside \nits statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction and \nis not covered by the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction. \nSee United States’ Response Brief Regarding Subject \nMatter Jurisdiction at 7–11 (“Gov’t Resp. Br.”).  For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Court finds that it \nhas ancillary jurisdiction over Movants’ claim. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized the authority \nof federal courts to exercise ancillary jurisdiction over \nclaims outside their statutory grant for two purposes: \n“(1)  to permit  disposition by a single court of claims \nthat are, in varying respects and degrees, factually \ninterdependent; and (2) to enable a court to function \nsuccessfully,  that  is,  to  manage  its  proceedings, \n94a \n\nvindicate its  authority, and effectuate its decrees.”  \nKokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379–80 (reversing the district \ncourt’s enforcement of a settlement agreement, which \narose from a lawsuit previously before the court, as \n“quite remote from what courts require in order to \nperform their function”) (citations omitted). \nIn Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991), \nthe  Supreme  Court  summarized  the  roots  of  the \nauthority  that  came  to be described  in  Kokkonen’s \nsecond prong: \nIt  has  long  been  understood  that \n“[c]ertain  implied  powers  must \nnecessarily result to our Courts of justice \nfrom  the  nature  of  their  institution,” \npowers “which cannot be dispensed with \nin a Court, because they are necessary to \nthe exercise of all others.” United States \nv. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L. Ed. 259 \n(1812); see also Roadway Express, Inc. v.  \nPiper, 447 U.S.  752, 764, 100 S.  Ct.  \n2455, 2463, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (citing \nHudson).  For  this  reason,  “Courts  of \njustice are universally acknowledged to \nbe vested, by their very creation, with \npower  to  impose  silence,  respect,  and \ndecorum,  in  their  presence,  and \nsubmission  to  their  lawful  mandates.” \nAnderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227, 5 \nL.  Ed.  242  (1821);  see  also  Ex  parte \nRobinson, 19 Wall. 505,510, 22 L. Ed. \n205 (1874). These powers are  “governed \nnot by rule or statute but by the control \nnecessarily vested in courts to manage \ntheir  own  affairs  so  as  to  achieve  the \norderly  and  expeditious  disposition  of \ncases.” Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. \n95a \n\n626, 630-631, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1388–1389, \n8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). \nChambers, 501 U.S. at 43. \nAs an Article III court, see In re Certification of \nQuestions of Law to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *4, \nciting In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731, 732 n.19 \n(FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (per curiam), the FISC possesses \nthe same inherent authority recognized in Chambers \nand  Kokkonen.3  Whether  the  FISC  has  ancillary \njurisdiction to adjudicate the Movants’ claim therefore \ndepends on whether the exercise of such jurisdiction is \nnecessary to its successful functioning. \nThe supervisory power courts hold over their own \nrecords  is  well-established.  See  Nixon  v.  Warner \nCommc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978) (“Every court \nhas  supervisory  power  over  its  own  records  and \nfiles”); Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, \n141  (2d  Cir. 2004) (“The court’s supervisory  power \ndoes  not  disappear  because  jurisdiction  over  the \nrelevant controversy has been lost. The records and \nfiles are not in limbo. So long as they remain under \nthe aegis of the court, they are superintended by the \njudges who have dominion over the court.”). \nIn  managing  their  proceedings  and  records, \nfederal courts must observe constitutional rights. See, \n                                            \n3 This principle is reflected in certain provisions of the FISC’s \nstatutory mandate. See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(g)( I) (“The [FISC and \nFISC  Court  of  Review]  may  establish  such  rules  and \nprocedures, and take such actions, as are reasonably necessary \nto administer their responsibilities under this [Act].”); §l803(h) \n(“Nothing in this [Act] shall be construed to reduce or contravene \nthe inherent authority of [the FISC] to determine or enforce \ncompliance with an order or rule of such court or with a procedure \napproved by such court.”). \n96a \n\ne.g., Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 253 (4th Cir. \n2014) (finding district court’s sealing order violated \nthe  public’s  right  of  access  under  the  First \nAmendment  and  remanding  with  instructions  to \nunseal the record); In re Providence Journal Co., 293 \nF.3d  1,  11–13  (1st  Cir.  2002)  (exercising  advisory \nmandamus  to resolve  novel  issues  of  great  public \nimportance  and  finding  district  court’s  practice  of \nrefusing to place legal memoranda on file in clerk’s \noffice  violated  First  Amendment);  Brown  & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp. v. F.T.C., 710 F.2d 1165, \n1177, 1180–81  (6th  Cir.  1983)  (stating  “the  First \nAmendment  and  the common  law do limit  judicial \ndiscretion” and vacating district court’s order sealing \nrecord of Federal Trade Commission proceeding for \nfailing  to  state  findings  or  conclusions  justifying \nnondisclosure to public). \nThe  manner  in  which  the  FISC  manages  its \nproceedings  is  also  constrained  by  statute.  FISA \nrequires  the  FISC  to adhere  to  specified  security \nprocedures: \nThe  record  of  proceedings  under  this \n[Act], including applications  made and \norders  granted,  shall  be  maintained \nunder security measures established by \nthe Chief Justice [of the United States] \nin  consultation  with  the  Attorney \nGeneral  and  the  Director  of  National \nIntelligence. \n50  U.S.C.  §  1803(c).  The  security  measures \nestablished by the Chief Justice in accord with Section \n1803(c) provide: \nCourt  Proceedings.  The  court  shall \nensure that all court records (including \n97a \n\nnotes,  draft  opinions,  and  related \nmaterials)  that  contain  classified \nnational  security  information  are \nmaintained  according  to  applicable \nExecutive Branch security standards for \nstoring and handling classified  national \nsecurity  information.  Records of  the \ncourt  shall  not  be  removed  from  its \npremises except in accordance with the \nAct,  applicable  court  rule,  and  these \nprocedures. \nSecurity Procedures Established Pursuant to Public \nLaw No. 95–511, 92. Stat. 1783, as Amended, By the \nChief  Justice  of the United  States for the  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Court  and  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review, ¶7 (2013) \n(“FISC Security Procedures”). \nTo meet this responsibility, the FISC adopted rules \nof  procedure  which  regulate  how  it  handles  and \nmaintains  national security  information.  See, e.g., \nFISA Ct. R. Proc. 3 (“In all matters, the Court and its \nstaff  shall  comply  with  the  security  measures \nestablished pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(c), 1822(e), \n1861(f)(4), and 188la(k)(l), as well as Executive Order \n13526, ‘Classified National Security Information’ (or \nits successor)”); FISA Ct. R. Proc. 62(b) (“Except when \nan order, opinion, or other decision is published or \nprovided to a party upon issuance, the Clerk may not \nrelease it, or other related record, without a Court \norder. Such records must be released in conformance \nwith the security measures referenced in Rule 3.”). \nRule 62(b) limits public access to FISC opinions by \nprohibiting release by the Clerk of Court to anyone \nother than the government at time of issuance unless \nspecifically  authorized  by  Court  order.  These  \n98a \n\nrestrictions endure unless release is ordered by the \nCourt,  regardless  of  the  status  of  the  underlying \nmatter. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  a  First \nAmendment  right of  public access to some  judicial \nproceedings. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Super. Ct., \n478  U.S.  1  (1986)  (“Press­Enterprise  II”);  Globe \nNewspaper  Co. v. Super. Ct. for  Norfolk  Cnty., 457 \nU.S. 596 (1982). When a claimant asserts that right of \naccess with respect to the proceedings or documents of \na federal  court  established  under  Article III,  it  is \nnecessary for that court to be able to adjudicate the \nclaim,  lest  its  own  actions  violate  the  First \nAmendment.4  In  this  case,  the  FISC’s  statutory \nobligation  to  maintain  its  records  securely \nunderscores the need for it to be able to adjudicate \nMovants’  claim.  In  seeking  access  to  certain  FISC \nopinions, Movants posit a First Amendment right that \nmay  conflict  with  the  above-described  security \nprocedures, which are required by statute and effected \nthrough  the  FISCs  rules.  The  FISCR  has  found \n                                            \n4 Moreover, adjudicating such claims may involve factual issues \nwhich  are  best  assessed  by  the  court  whose  proceedings  or \nrecords are at issue. See, e.g., Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606–\n08 (First Amendment challenge to closure of a criminal trial \nduring testimony of a minor victim of a sexual offense required \ntrial  court  to  assess  factors  such  as  victim’s  “psychological \nmaturity and understanding” and ‘‘the interests of parents and \nrelatives”); United States v. Wecht, 537 F.3d 222, 239–42 (3d Cir. \n2008) (First  Amendment  challenge  to withholding  names  of \njurors from the public in a criminal trial required district court \nto evaluate whether risks to jurors were “serious and specific”); \nOregonian Pub. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1467 (9th \nCir.  1990)  (First  Amendment  challenge  to  sealing  of  plea \nagreement  required  district  court  to  evaluate  “evidentiary \nsupport” for contention that exposure of defendant’s cooperation \nwith law enforcement would threaten his and his family’s safety). \n99a \n\nMovants’  claim  to  be  judicially  cognizable.  In  re \nCertification of Questions of Law to FISCR, 2018 WL \n2709456 at *7. If Movants’ claim has merit, the First \nAmendment may require modification to the manner \nin  which  the  FISC  maintains  its  opinions.5  It  is \nnecessary,  therefore,  for  the  FISC  to  adjudicate \nMovants’ claim in order to ensure that its proceedings \ncomport with a correct understanding of both the First \nAmendment  and  statutorily  required  security \nprocedures.  The  FISC’s  ability  to  “function \nsuccessfully”  and  “manage  its  proceedings,” \nKokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379–80, would be significantly \ncompromised if it lacked authority to adjudicate First \nAmendment  claims  such  as  the  one  asserted  by \nMovants.  \nThe fact that Congress has conferred on the FISC \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  over  a narrow range of \nmatters, in comparison with the jurisdiction of federal \ndistrict courts, does not detract from the grounds for \nfinding  ancillary  jurisdiction.  The  “doctrine  of \nancillary jurisdiction . . . recognizes  federal  courts’ \njurisdiction  over  some  matters  (otherwise  beyond \ntheir competence) that are incidental to other matters \nproperly  before them.”  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 378 \n(emphasis added). Other specialized courts of law have \nrecognized  their  authority  to  decide Constitution-\nbased claims related to their own proceedings, despite \nnot having original jurisdiction  over claims “arising \n                                            \n5 It must be noted that this Court’s authority to decide the \ninstant matter does not depend on the merits. See Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (“It is firmly \nestablished in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to \narguable)  cause  of  action  does  not  implicate  subject-matter \njurisdiction, i.e., the courts’ statutory or constitutional power to \nadjudicate the case.”). \n100a \n\nunder  the Constitution,” as conferred  upon  federal \ndistrict  courts  by  28  U.S.C.  §  1331.  See  In  re \nSymington, 209 B.R. 678, 691–92 (1997) (“This Court \nunquestionably has subject matter jurisdiction  over \n[news companies’  motion  to intervene  and strike \nprotective order keeping debtor records private] . . . . \nAs long as a protective order remains in effect, the \ncourt  that  entered  the order  retains the  power  to \nmodify it . . .”) (citations omitted).6 See also Dacoron v. \nBrown, 4 Vet. App 115, 119 (1993) (“[N]othing  in the \nabove analysis [recognizing district court jurisdiction \nover  Constitutional claims]  implies that  this Court \ndoes not have power to review claims pertaining to the \nconstitutionality  of  statutory  and  regulatory \nprovisions. Such authority is inherent in the Court’s \nstatus as a court of law, and is expressly provided in \n38 U.S.C. § 726l(a)(1) . . .”) (citations omitted). \nThe  government  suggests  that  the  FISC  lacks \njurisdiction over Movants’ claim because the opinions \nto  which  Movants  seek  access  were  not  issued  in \nproceedings currently before the FISC. See Gov’t Resp. \nBr.  at  9–11  (contrasting  Movants’  claim  seeking \n“documents from other cases” with claims relating to \nunlawful  disclosure  of  information  “in ongoing . . . \nactions  pending  in  district  court”  and  “efforts  to \n                                            \n6 Cf. In re Alterra Healthcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66, 70 (2006) \n(finding newspaper’s First Amendment, federal common law, and \nstatutory claims for access to several settlement agreements, \nwhich  had  been  filed  under  seal  pursuant  to  orders  of  the \nbankruptcy court, to be “a core proceeding over which the Court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) \n& 157(b)(2)(A)”); In re Bennett Funding Group, Inc., 226 B.R. 331, \n332-33 (1998) (adjudicating newspaper’s First Amendment and \nfederal common law right of access to retainer agreement filed in \ncamera pursuant to core jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(b) \nand 157(a), (b)(l) and (2)(A))). \n101a \n\nintervene in an extant case”). While the government \nis  correct  insofar  as  the  associated  intelligence-\ngathering authorizations granted  by the FISC have \nexpired,  the  FISC  has  a  continuing  obligation  to \nmaintain the records of those proceedings in accord \nwith Section 1803(c) and Rule 62(b). Moreover, that \nobligation remains in place for those portions of the \nrequested opinions that are still  classified  and  not \navailable to the public, notwithstanding the release \nof  other  portions  based  on  Executive  Branch \ndeclassification decisions. \nIn light of the above analysis and consistent with \nthis Court’s prior decisions,7 the Court will exercise \nancillary jurisdiction pursuant to Kokkonen’s second \nprong and proceed to the merits. \n \n \n                                            \n7 See In re Mot. for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \n484, 487 (FISA Ct. 2007) (“In re Motion for Release of Court \nRecords 2007”) (recognizing authority over court records and \nconcluding, “it would be quite odd if the FISC did not have \njurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to \nthe court’s very own records and files”); In re Orders of Court \nInterpreting Section 215 of Patriot Act, 2013 WL 5460064 (Sept. \n13, 2013) (exercising subject matter jurisdiction over third party \nclaim for access to FISC records); and In re Mot. for Consent to \nDisclosure of Court Records or, in the Alternative, Determination \nof the Effect of Court’s Rules on Statutory Access Rights, 2013 WL \n5460051 at *2 (June 12, 2013) (finding jurisdiction to adjudicate \na dispute over whether a FISC rule prohibited the government \nfrom disclosing its copies of a FISC opinion pursuant to the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552). \n102a \n\nIII.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT \nPROVIDE A QUALIFIED RIGHT OF \nPUBLIC ACCESS TO THE OPINIONS AT \nISSUE. \nMovants and Amicus urge the Court to apply the \n“experience-and-logic”  test  articulated  in  Press-\nEnterprise II and find a First Amendment right of \npublic access to FISC opinions. Mot.  for Release of Ct. \nRecords at 12; Reply Brief of Amicus Curiae (“Amicus \nReply Br.”) at 45–47.8 \nUnder  the  First  Amendment,  .  .  .  the \nSupreme  Court  has  applied  what  is \nreferred  to  as  the  experience-and-logic \ntest  to  determine  whether  there  is  a \nconstitutional  right  of  access  to \nparticular court records or proceedings. \nThat  test  entails  asking  whether  the \nrecord  or  proceeding  in  question  has \n“historically been open to the press and \ngeneral  public,”  and  “whether  public \naccess plays a significant positive role in \nthe functioning of the particular process \nin question.” \nIn re Certification of Questions of Law to FISCR, 2018 \nWL 2709456 at *3 (quoting Press  Enterprise II, 478 \nU.S.  at  8).  If  these  questions  are  answered \naffirmatively, then the First Amendment confers  a \nqualified right of public access, Press-Enterprise II, \n478  U.S.  at  8,  which  entails  a  “presumption  of \nopenness  [which]  may  be  overcome  only  by  an \noverriding interest based on findings that closure is \n                                            \n8 Amicus also argues that the common law provides a public \nright of access, see Amicus Reply Br. at 34–45; however, Movants \nhave asserted only a First Amendment claim. \n103a \n\nessential to preserve higher values and is  narrowly \ntailored  to serve that interest,” Press-Enter. Co. v. \nSuper. Ct., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (“Press-Enterprise \nI”). Although the Supreme Court has never applied the \nexperience-and-logic  test  “outside  the  context  of \ncriminal judicial  proceedings  or the transcripts  of \nsuch proceedings,” Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. U.S. \nDep’t of Justice, 331 F.3d 918, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2003), \nthe FISCR’s opinion in In re Certification of Questions \nof Law to FISCR indicates that it is applicable here. \nA. The proper framing of the experience-\nand-logic test \nHow broadly or narrowly to apply the experience-\nand-logic test has sometimes been a vexing question,9 \nbut  the  reasoning  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Press-\nEnterprise II provides guidance. The Supreme Court \nobserved  that,  “[a]lthough  many  governmental \nprocesses operate best under public scrutiny, it takes \nlittle imagination to recognize that there are some \nkinds of government operations that would be totally \nfrustrated if conducted openly.” Press-Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 8–9. This distinction makes it evident that \nthe experience-and-logic inquiry described in Press-\nEnterprise  II  should  be  directed  with  sufficient \nprecision to appreciate the history and nature of the \nparticular type of proceeding or document in question. \nSee Times Mirror Co. v. United States, 873 F.2d 1210, \n1213  (9th  Cir.  1989)  (“the  Supreme  Court  has \n                                            \n9 See, e.g., Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1104 (D.C.

In addition to the \nrequirement  that  the  FISC  comply  with  security \nmeasures adopted by the Chief Justice (see supra pp. \n7–8), orders directing third parties to produce tangible \nthings in support of foreign intelligence investigations \nmust be entered ex parte and not disclose the nature \nof the investigation for which they are issued. See 50 \nU.S.C. § 1861(c)(1), (2)(E). Recipients of such orders \nare subject to nondisclosure requirements. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 186l(d)(1). Petitions challenging such orders “shall \nbe filed  under seal” and, when  adjudicating such \npetitions,  the  FISC  “shall,  upon  request  of  the \nGovernment,  review  ex  parte  and  in  camera  any \ngovernment  submission,  or portions thereof,  which \nmay  include  classified  information.”  50  U.S.C.  § \n1861(f)(5); see also 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(l)(2) (equivalent \nprovision  for  FISC  proceedings  on  petitions  to \nchallenge or enforce directives under Section 702 of \nFISA). FISC proceedings on applications to approve \ninstallation and use of PR/TT devices and other forms \nof intelligence collection also must be closed to the \npublic and any resulting orders that are served on \nthird parties are protected from further disclosure.11 \n                                            \nindictment search warrant proceedings and materials). \n11 PR/TT orders must be entered ex parte and provide that \npersons directed to assist in installing or operating a PR/TT \ndevice shall do so “in such a manner as will protect its secrecy” \n106a \n\nFinally, even the congressionally-mandated process \nfor release of FISC opinions that involve “a significant \nconstruction or interpretation” of law, see 50 U.S.C. § \n1872(a),  does  not  presume  openness.  Rather,  it \ninvolves an Executive Branch declassification review \nthat results in public release of each such opinion “to \nthe greatest extent practicable,” “consistent with” the \nresults of that review, which may involve redaction of \nsensitive  information  or  release  of  a  summary  in \nplace of the opinion itself. § 1872(a), (b), (c) (emphasis \nadded).  See also In re Certification of Questions  of \nLaw  to  FISCR, 2018  WL 2709456 at *1 (the “legal \nanalysis” in FISC opinions “often contain[s] highly \nsensitive information, the release of which could be \ndamaging to national security”). \nThe  foregoing  considerations  instruct  that  the \nFISC should apply the experience-and logic test solely \nin  the  context  of  this  Court’s  opinions  relating  to \nforeign  intelligence  collection.  Movants  prefer  a \nbroader perspective and argue that the Court should \napply the experience-and-logic test to judicial opinions \ngenerally, or at least to such opinions that  interpret \nthe “meaning and constitutionality of public statutes.” \nMot. for Release of Ct. Records at 13–17.12 But using \n                                            \nand “shall maintain, under security procedures approved by the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, any \nrecords concerning the pen register or trap and trace device or \nthe aid  furnished.”  50 U.S.C.  §  1842(d)(1),  (2)(B).    Similar \nprovisions  apply  to  FISC  orders  approving  electronic \nsurveillance,  see  50  U.S.C.  §  1805(a),  (c)(2)(B)–(C),  physical \nsearch,  see  50  U.S.C.  §  1824(a),  (c)(2)(B)–(C),  and  certain \nacquisitions targeting U.S. persons who are outside the United \nStates, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881b(c)(1), (5)(B)–(C) and 188lc(c)(1). \n12 Amicus similarly argues that the inquiry should encompass \nhow judicial opinions “are treated based on the common law right \nof access” and the history of public access to documents in other \n107a \n\nsuch a broad platform to evaluate experience and logic \nwould lose focus on the distinctive characteristics of \nFISC opinions and proceedings described above. \nMovants’ reasoning  behind their proposal is not \npersuasive.  First, Movants assert that the experience \ninquiry ‘“does not look to the particular practice of any \none jurisdiction, but instead to the experience in that \ntype  or  kind  of  hearing  throughout  the  United \nStates.”’ Id. at 13 (quoting El Vocero de P.R. v. Puerto \nRico, 508 U.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per curiam) (emphasis \nin original); accord Amicus Reply Br. at 50. But the \nFISC  is  not  one  forum  among  others  similarly \nsituated: it has singular and national jurisdiction over \nall FISA applications. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(a)(1), \n1822(c), 1842(b), 186l(b)(1), 188Ia(j)(1)(A), 188lb(a)(1), \n188lc(a)(1). The FISC is the only forum that conducts \nthe  relevant  types  of  proceedings  and  issues  the \nrelevant types of opinions. \nRelatedly, Amicus argues that “‘[t]radition is not \nmeant . . . to be construed narrowly”’ and the Court \nshould look “‘to analogous proceedings and documents \nof the same type or kind.”’ Amicus Reply Br. at 50–51 \n(quoting In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 \n(1st Cir. 2003)). But in the decision relied upon, the \nFirst Circuit also observed that “analogies” to other \nprocedural contexts must be “solid ones” that “serve \nas reasonable proxies for the ‘favorable judgment of \nexperience’ concerning access to the actual documents \nin question.” In re Boston Herald, 321 F.3d at 184 \n(quoting  Press-Enterprise  II,  478  U.S.  at  8). \nAccordingly, the First Circuit dismissed as “too broad” \n                                            \ncourts—either other specialized Article III courts, e.g., the U.S. \nCourt for International Trade, or Article Ill courts generally. See \nAmicus Reply Br. at 47–52. \n108a \n\na proposed analogy between access to criminal trials \nand access to documents submitted ex parte in support \nof  a  defendant’s  request  for  assistance  with  legal \nexpenses.  321  F.3d at  184.  Similarly,  the Fourth \nCircuit  in In re  § 2703(d)  Application rejected the \nargument that a claimed right of public access to an \norder under Section 2703(d) of Title 18 of the U.S. \nCode could be founded on the “long history of access to \njudicial  opinions  and  orders,”  because  that \ninterpretation of the First Amendment was “too broad, \nand directly contrary” to precedent “that this right \nextends  only  to  particular  judicial  records  and \ndocuments.” 707 F.3d at 291 n.8 (emphasis in original; \ninternal  quotation  marks  omitted).  This  Court \nconcludes that public access to opinions issued in civil \nand criminal proceedings in other courts does not bear \non the experience inquiry here due to the distinctive \nnature of the underlying FISC proceedings. \nMovants reason that the experience-and-logic test \nshould be more  generously  analyzed when “access to \na new forum” is at issue “[b]ecause there will never be \na tradition of public access in new forums,” Mot. for \nRelease of Ct. Records at 14 (emphasis in original); \nhowever, they do not explain why the FISC, which has \ncontinuously entertained applications for approval of \nforeign intelligence collection since 1979, should be \nregarded as so new that it cannot have established its \nown “history” regarding public access.13 In any case, \n                                            \n13 Cf. In re Application of New York Times, 577 F.3d at 410 \n(reviewing in 2009 how Title III wiretap applications have been \nhandled since Title III’s enactment in 1968 and concluding that \nsuch applications “have not historically been open to the press \nand general public,” notwithstanding claimant’s contention that \nsuch applications “are merely judicial records that, like search \nwarrants or docket sheets, have been historically open to public \naccess”); In re Application of Leopold to Unseal Certain Electronic \n109a \n\ndue  to  the  FISC’s  purported  youth,  Movants  urge \nreliance  on a  broader  category  of “judicial  opinions \ninterpreting  the  meaning  and  constitutionality  of \npublic  statutes” to gauge experience  and  logic.   See \nid., citing New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York \nCity Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 299 (2d Cir. 2012) \n(“NYCLU”).14 But even if the FISC were “new,” its \nsingular caseload and statutory obligations require \nthe  experience-and-logic  to  be  applied  in  a  more \nfocused and, necessarily, limited fashion.  See In re \n                                            \nSurveillance Applications and Orders, 300 F. Supp. 3d 61, 87–88 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (describing as “doubtful” whether, over 31 years \nafter enactment of § 2703(d), orders issued thereunder “are of \nsuch  recent  vintage”  that  the  court  should  broaden  the \nexperience  inquiry  to  encompass  whether  search  warrant \nmaterials  have  historically  been  open  to  the  public), \nreconsideration denied, 327 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2018), appeal \nfiled (D.C. Cir. Sept. 19, 2018). \n14 Movants also cite In re Copley Press, Inc., 518 F.3d 1022 (9th \nCir. 2008). Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 14. That decision \ndid not involve an expansive application of the experience-and-\nlogic test in view of a “new forum.” Instead, it followed Ninth \nCircuit precedent that satisfaction of the logic prong can be \nsufficient to establish a qualified right of public access, even if \nthe experience  prong  is  not  satisfied.  518  F.3d  at  1026–27 \n(relying on Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court, 156 \nF.3d 940, 948 (9th Cir. 1998) and Seattle Times Co. v. U.S. Dist. \nCourt, 845 F.2d 1513, 1516–17 (9th Cir. 1988)).  Although the \nTenth Circuit agreed, see United States v. Gonzales, 150 F.3d \n1246, 1258 (10th Cir. 1998), the weight of circuit authority \nrequires satisfaction of both prongs, see Sullo & Bobbitt, PLLC v. \nMilner, 765 F.3d 388, 393–94 (5th Cir. 2014); In re Application \nfor § 2703(d) Order, 707 F.3d at 291; In re Search of Fair Finance, \n692 F.3d 424, 429–31 (6th Cir. 2012); In re Application of New \nYork Times, 577 F.3d at 409–10; North Jersey Media Group, Inc. \nv. Ashcroft, 308 F.3d 198, 213 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v. El-\nSayegh, 131 F.3d 158, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The Court need not \naddress this dichotomy because it finds that neither experience \nnor logic is satisfied in this case. See infra pp. 19–30. \n110a \n\nBoston Herald, 321 F.3d at 184 (even if the type of \nproceeding at issue is of “relatively recent vintage,” \nother types of proceedings can be relevant only if they \n“serve  as  reasonable  proxies  for  the  favorable \njudgment of experience concerning access to the actual \ndocuments  in question”) (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). \nThe Second Circuit’s decision in NYCLU does not \nindicate otherwise.  NYCLU involved a claimed First \nAmendment right of public access to hearings before \nthe  Transit  Adjudication  Bureau  (TAB)  concerning \nalleged violations of public transit rules of conduct. \nThe TAB was an administrative body created to lessen \nthe burden of adjudicating such violations in criminal \ncourt.  684  F.3d  at  289–93.  In  applying  the \nexperience-and-logic  test,  the  Second  Circuit \nconsidered the historical openness of such transit-rule \nadjudications in criminal court, as well as the practices \nof the TAB. Id at 300. It did so in part because the TAB \nwas new but more importantly because the TAB and \nthe criminal court were functionally equivalent, that \nis, “[t]he process that goes on at TAB hearings is a \ndetermination of whether a respondent has violated a \nTransit  Authority  Rule.  And  that  process  was \npresumptively  open . . . when such proceedings were \nheard  only”  in  the  criminal  court.  Id.  at  301–02 \n(emphasis in original). \nFinally, Movants warn that a narrow experience \ninquiry  “would  permit  Congress  to  circumvent  the \nconstitutional right of access altogether—even as to, \nsay, criminal trials—simply by providing that such \ntrials henceforth be heard in a newly created forum.” \nMot. for Release of Ct. Records at 14. Their concern is \nboth hypothetical and probably unconstitutional. In \naddition, it presupposes a prior right of public access \n111a \n\nwhich never existed. Before Congress established the \nFISC,  there  were  no  judicial  proceedings  on \napplications  for  approval  of  foreign  intelligence \ncollection  and  Executive  Branch  documents  and \ndeliberations regarding foreign intelligence collection \nwere hardly open to the public. \nAccordingly, the Court will apply the experience-\nand-logic test to FISC opinions concerning requests \nfor approval of foreign intelligence collection; more \nspecifically, opinions issued by the FISC in: (1) ex \nparte  proceedings  on  government  applications  for \napproval of particular forms of intelligence gathering, \nsee,  e.g.,  50  U.S.C.  §§  1804–1805  (electronic \nsurveillance),  or  involving  reviews  of  certifications \nand  procedures  respecting  acquisition  of  foreign \nintelligence information pursuant to § 1881a(j); (2) ex \nparte proceedings on government requests to modify \norders previously issued in such proceedings; and (3) \nadversarial proceedings between the government and \na person directed to provide information or otherwise \nassist  in  foreign  intelligence  collection,  see,  e.g., \n§1881a(i)(4)–(5) (proceedings on petitions to challenge \nor enforce directives issued under § 1881a(i)(1)). The \nfollowing  discussion  refers  to  these  types  of \nproceedings as “foreign intelligence proceedings.” \nB. Application of the experience-and-\nlogic test \nFor  the  reasons  explained  below,  the  Court \nconcludes that the asserted right of public access fails \nunder  both  the  experience  inquiry  and  the  logic \ninquiry. \n1.  Experience \nThe  experience  inquiry  concerns  “whether  the \nrecord or proceeding in question has ‘historically been \n112a \n\nopen  to  the  press  and  general  public.”’  In  re \nCertification of Questions of Law to FISCR, 2018 WL \n2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. \nat 8) (citation omitted). \nFor the first 30 years of the FISC’s existence, there \nplainly was no history of openness respecting FISC \nopinions. Prior to 2007, just two FISC opinions had \nbeen publicly released.15 The opinion in In re Motion \nfor Release  of Court  Records  2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d \n484, which  was the third FISC opinion to be publicly \nreleased,  concerned  an  adversarial  proceeding \ninitiated  by  a  non-governmental  party  claiming  a \nFirst  Amendment  right  of  access  to  FISC  records, \nmuch like the current proceeding. In that matter, the \nCourt found no tradition of public access, even for \n“cases presenting  legal issues of broad  significance,” \nand described the FISC as “not a court whose place or \nprocess [had] historically been open to the public.” Id. \nat 493. \nIn  contrast,  Movants  and  Amicus  point  to  the \nconsiderably  larger  number  of  FISC  opinions  and \norders that have been made public since In re Motion \nfor  Release of Court Records 2007. See Movants’ Br. \nat 17; Amicus Reply Br. at 49–50. According to the \ncatalog of publicly available FISC and FISCR opinions \ncompiled by Amicus, see Amicus Appendix at Tab A, \nIn re Certification of Questions of Law to FISCR, 2018 \n                                            \n15 See In re Motion for Release of Court Records 2007, 526 F. \nSupp. 2d at 488 n.13 (referencing prior releases of In re All \nMatters Submitted to FISC, 218 F.

See supra \npp. 19–21. History is the past considered as a whole, \nnot  just  the  most  recent  developments.  Cf.  North \nJersey Media Group, 308 F.3d at 211 (“the tradition \n                                            \n21 Two of the twelve opinions are responsive to Movants’ claim. \nSee  Amicus  Appendix,  Entries  23  and  26,  referencing \nMemorandum  Opinion,  In re  Application  of  FBI  for  Order \nRequiring Prod. of Tangible Things, No. BR 13-158 (FISA Ct. \nOct. 11, 2013) and In re Application of FBI for Order Requiring \nProd. of Tangible Things, 2013 WL 5741573, respectively. \n22 On December 17, 2019, the FISC published an order which \nincluded  a discussion  of  the government’s duty of candor  in \nproceedings under Title I of FISA. See Order, In re Accuracy \nConcerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the FISC, No. \nMisc. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Dec. 17, 2019). That order did not require \na declassification review because it did not contain classified \ninformation in the first instance. \n23 Amicus also identified  113 FISC orders that have been \nreleased to the public. See Amicus Appendix at Tab B. That \nnumber is unpersuasive in the context of the thousands of orders \nissued by the FISC during its history that have not been publicly \nreleased. See, e.g., Report of Director of Admin. Office of U.S. \nCourts on Activities of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts \nfor  2015,  2016,  2017  and  2018,  https://www.uscourts.gov/ \nstatistics-reports/analysis-reports/directors-report-foreign-\nintelligence-surveillance-courts. \n119a \n\nof  open  deportation  hearings  is  too  recent  and \ninconsistent to support a First Amendment right of \naccess”). \nNotably, FISC opinions that contained classified \ninformation have been released only after a review \nand redaction by the Executive Branch. Movants seek \naccess to redacted classified information in opinions \nthey  have  already  received.  Since  such  classified \ninformation has never been released by the FISC, in \nthat regard there is no relevant experience. \n2.  Logic \nThe logic inquiry concerns “‘whether public access \nplays a significant positive role in the functioning of \nthe particular process in question.”’ In re Certification \nof Questions of Law to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3 \n(quoting  Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8; citation \nomitted).  In  making  that  determination,  a  court \nbalances the benefits of public openness against  any \nharms, see, e.g.,  In re  Search of  Fair  Finance, 692 \nF.3d at 431–42; In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d \nat 186–88;  United  States  v.  Gonzales,  150  F.3d  at \n1259–60, including, when applicable, harm to national \nsecurity, see North Jersey Media Group, 308 F.3d at \n217. \nMovants contend that access to FISC opinions will \nbe  beneficial  in  two  particular  ways:  (1)  public \nknowledge  of  the  law  is  necessary  for  democratic \ngovernance,  especially  with  regard  to  Executive \nBranch conduct that implicates constitutional rights, \nsee Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 16; and (2) access \nto  FISC  opinions  specifically  will  promote  public \nconfidence in the FISC and the FISA process, enable \n“more  refined  decisionmaking  in  future  cases,” \ncontribute to the decisionmaking of other courts, and \n120a \n\n“improve  democratic  oversight,”  see  id.  at  17–20. \nThese are benefits that might plausibly accrue from \npublic access to FISC opinions, just as they generally \naccrue from public access to other types of judicial \nopinions.  But  as  with  the  experience  inquiry,  the \nproper  focus  of  the  logic  inquiry  must  be  on  ‘“the \nfunctioning of the particular process in question.”’ In \nre Certification of Questions of Law to  FISCR, 2018 \nWL 2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 \nU.S.  at  8;  citation  omitted);  see  supra  pp.  12–18. \n“‘[T]he value of access must be measured in specifics,”’ \nIn re Search of Fair Finance, 692 F.3d at 433 (quoting \nRichmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, \n589  (1980)  (Brennan,  J.,  concurring  in  the \njudgment),24 and specific harms to the proceeding at \nissue outweigh generic assertions about the benefits \nof openness: \n[“]Every  judicial  proceeding,  indeed \nevery  governmental  process,  arguably \nbenefits  from  public  scrutiny  to  some \ndegree,  in  that  openness  leads  to  a \nbetter-informed  citizenry  and  tends  to \ndeter government officials from abusing \nthe powers of government.” Yet, “because \nthe  integrity  and  independence”  of \nproceedings such as the grand jury, jury \ndeliberations,  and  the  internal \ncommunications  of  the  court  “are \n                                            \n24  The  quoted  passage  from  Justice  Brennan’s  opinion \ncontinues: “Analysis is not advanced by rhetorical statements \nthat all information bears upon public issues; what is crucial in \nindividual cases is whether access to a particular government \nprocess is important in terms of that very process.” Richmond \nNewspapers,  448  U.S.  at  589  (Brennan,  J.,  concurring  in \njudgment). \n121a \n\nthreatened by public disclosures, claims \nof  ‘improved  self-governance’  and  ‘the \npromotion of fairness’ cannot be used as \nan incantation to open these proceedings \nto the public.” \nUnited States v. Gonzales, 150 F.3d at  1260 (quoting \nTimes  Mirror  Co.,  873  F.2d  at  1213;  internal \ncitations  omitted);  accord  In  re  Search  of  Fair \nFinance, 692 F.3d at 432–33 (finding that the general \nbenefits of “assur[ing]  that  established  procedures \nare  being followed,” promoting “the appearance of \nfairness,” and providing “a check on . . . magistrate  \njudges”  were  “outweighed  by  the  very  particular \nharms” to the “criminal  investigatory  process” that \nwould  result  from  publication  of  search  warrant \ndocuments).  But  see  In  re  Search  Warrant  for \nSecretarial  Area,  855  F.2d  569,  572–74  (8th  Cir. \n1988)  (First  Amendment  confers  qualified  right of \npublic access to search warrant documents). \nIn In re Motion for Release of Court Records 2007, \nwhich involved an asserted First Amendment right of \naccess  to  FISC  electronic  surveillance  orders  and \nrelated  pleadings,  the  Court  found  that  “the \ndetrimental  consequences  of broad public access to \nFISC proceedings or records would greatly outweigh” \nany  benefits.  526  F.  Supp.  2d  at  494.  Those \ndetrimental consequences included the identification \nof  “methods  of  surveillance,”  which  “would  permit \nadversaries” to “conceal their activities;” disclosures of \n“confidential sources  of  information,” which “would \nchill  current  and  potential  sources  from  providing \ninformation”  and  “might  put  some  in  personal \njeopardy;”  and disclosures  of intelligence  gathering \nthat could harm national security in other ways, “such \nas damaging relations with foreign governments.” Id. \n122a \n\nAs here, the ACLU in In re Motion for Release of \nCourt  Records  2007  sought  access  to  “only  those \nportions of the requested materials that the Court \nfinds are not properly classified.” Id. at 495. In that \ncase, the Court found that the logic test would not be \nsatisfied even if it were applied to “only those parts of \nthe  requested  materials  that  the  Court,  after \nindependent  review, .  .  .  determined  need  not  be \nwithheld.”  Id.25  The  Court  noted  that  its  review \n“might err by releasing information that in fact should \nremain classified,” and thereby damage the national \nsecurity. 526 F. Supp. 2d at 495. Moreover, “the FISA \nprocess would be adversely  affected  if submitting \nsensitive information to the FISC could subject the \nExecutive Branch’s classification to a heightened form \nof  judicial  review”26  because  the  “greater  risk  of \n                                            \n25 The Court also expressed doubt ‘‘that the logic test should be \nso narrowly applied.” Id. at 495 & n.29 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Indeed, it is doubtful that a decision to release discrete \ninformation within a document could shed any light on whether \ngeneral public access to other documents of the same type would \nbenefit the particular process at issue. See Globe Newspaper Co., \n868 F.2d at 509–10 (‘‘the fact that in certain cases access to the \n[requested] records may not be detrimental to the functioning” of \nthe process in question, “and perhaps may even be beneficial to \nit, ... is not sufficient reason to create a presumption in favor of \nopenness”) (emphasis omitted). \n26  The  ACLU  had  argued  that  the  FISC  should  review \nExecutive Branch classification decisions in a “probing manner” \nthat is less deferential than the review of record releases under \nFOIA. 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491 & n.18. The ACLU and other \nMovants advocate for the same rigorous review by the FISC in \nthis case. See Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 25 (“Independent \njudicial review of any proposed redactions . . . is necessary \nbecause the standards that justify classification do not always \nsatisfy the strict constitutional standard and . . . executive-\nbranch decisions cannot substitute for the judicial determination \nrequired by the First Amendment.”). \n123a \n\ndeclassification and disclosure over Executive Branch \nobjections  would  chill the government’s  interaction \nwith the Court.”  526 F. Supp. 2d at 496.  The Court \nanticipated  three  deleterious  consequences  of  that \nchilling effect: (1) it “could damage national security \ninterests  if,  for  example,  the  government  opted  to \nforgo surveillance or search of legitimate targets in \norder to retain control of sensitive information that a \nFISA application would contain;” (2) it might create \n“an incentive for government officials to avoid judicial \nreview”  by  conducting  surveillance  without  FISC \napproval  “where  the  need  for  such  approval  is \nunclear;” and (3) it could threaten “the free flow of \ninformation to the FISC that is needed for an ex parte \nproceeding  to  result  in  sound  decisionmaking  and \neffective oversight.” Id. \nThe same anticipated harms preclude finding that \nthe logic test is satisfied in this case. First, the fact \nthat Movants seek access only to FISC opinions and \nnot applications or other related documents does not \nabate  the  harms  or  distinguish  In  re  Motion  for \nRelease of Court Records 2007. Given the extent to \nwhich sensitive information about subjects such as \nongoing  counterintelligence  and  counterterrorism \ninvestigations  and  means  of  technical  collection \nappears in opinions issued  by the  FISC  in foreign \nintelligence  proceedings,  the  Court  finds  that the \nabove-described harms can be anticipated from public \naccess to such opinions. \nMoreover,  Movants  have  not  demonstrated  any \nerror in the assessment of harms in In re Motion for \nRelease  of  Court  Records  2007.  They  have  merely \nasserted without explanation that  “the Court erred in \nconcluding  that  public  access  would  ‘result  in  a \ndiminished flow of information, to the detriment of the \n124a \n\nprocess in question.’” Mot. for Release of Ct. Records \nat 21 (quoting In re Motion for Release of Court Records \n2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496). But courts have found \nthat public access to various types of proceedings and \ndocuments  could  impede  the  receipt  of  relevant \ninformation, including search warrant documents,27 \npresentence  reports  and  objections  thereto,28  and \ntranscripts  and  materials  respecting  criminal \ndefendants’  requests  for  assistance  with  legal \nexpenses.29 In addition, it is not unreasonable to be \nconcerned that a FISC judge “might err by releasing \ninformation  that  in  fact  should  remain  classified,” \nthereby damaging national security. 526 F. Supp. 2d \nat 495. The FISCR has similarly recognized that the \nFISC “is not well equipped to make the sometimes \ndifficult determinations as to whether portions of its \norders  may  be  released  without  posing  a  risk  to \nnational  security  or  compromising  ongoing \n                                            \n27 See, e.g., In re Search of Fair Finance, 692 F.3d at 432 \n(“[P]ublic access to search warrant documents” would cause the \ngovernment “to be more selective in the information it disclosed \nin order to  preserve  the  integrity  of its investigations. This \nlimitation on the flow of information to the magistrate judges \ncould  impede  their  ability  to  accurately  determine  probable \ncause.”). \n28 See, e.g., In re Morning Song Bird Food Litig., 831 F.3d at \n776 (disclosure “would tend to restrict the sentencing court’s \naccess to relevant knowledge by discouraging the transmission of \ninformation by defendants and cooperating third parties”). \n29  In  re  Boston  Herald,  321  F.3d  at  188  (“specter  of \ndisclosure . . .  might  lead  defendants  (or other sources called \nupon by the court) to withhold information”); In re Gonzales, 150 \nF.3d  at  1259  (without  “assurance  that  the  information \nrevealed . . . will not be disclosed, a defendant and his or her \ncounsel would be discouraged” from full disclosure of information \nto the court). \n125a \n\ninvestigations.” In re Certification of Questions of Law \nto FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *1. The logic inquiry \nrequires  a  balancing  of  the  benefits  of  openness \nagainst any concomitant harms, see supra p. 24, and \nthe  risk  of  harming  national  security  through \ndisclosure of sensitive information must be weighed in \nstriking that balance. \nFinally, Movants assert that Congress’ decision in \n2015  to  establish  an  Executive  Branch  process  to \ndeclassify and release significant FISC opinions, see \nUSA FREEDOM Act of 2015 § 402(a)(2) (codified at 50 \nU.S.C.  §  1872(a)),  reinforces  their  arguments \nregarding the logic inquiry. Movants’ Br. at 18. The \nCourt  disagrees.  The  key  figure  in  the  statutory \nprocess  is  the DNI  who,  unlike  FISC  judges,  is \nparticularly well situated to decide what information \nmust  be  withheld  to  protect  national  security  and \nwhat information is safe to release.30  The DNI, in \nconsultation  with  the  Attorney  General,  must \n“conduct a declassification review” of FISC opinions \nthat  include  “a  significant  construction  or \ninterpretation of any provision of law.”  50 U.S.C. § \n1872(a). Congress did not prescribe standards to apply \nin  such  review.  Instead,  it  left  Executive  Branch \nclassification standards in place and required that the \nopinions  be  made  public  “to  the  greatest  extent \npracticable,” “consistent with” the review’s results. Id. \n(emphasis added). Important to the issues presented \nhere,  the  statute  specifically  permits  the  DNI,  in \n                                            \n30 Cf. Central Intelligence Agency v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 180 \n(1985)  (“[I]t  is  the  responsibility of  the  Director  of  Central \nIntelligence, not that of the judiciary, to weigh the variety of \ncomplex and subtle factors in determining whether disclosure of \ninformation may lead to an unacceptable risk of compromising \nthe Agency’ s intelligence-gathering process.”). \n126a \n\nconsultation with the Attorney General, to waive the \npublication requirement if doing so “is necessary to \nprotect the national security of the United States or \nproperly classified intelligence sources or methods,” \nprovided that an unclassified summary of the FISC’s \nlegal  interpretation  is  prepared  and  published.  50 \nU.S.C. § 1872(c). \nMovants advocate for a wholly different process in \nwhich the Court would independently apply criteria \nfor  withholding  information  that  are  more  limited \nthan  those  in  the  Executive  Branch  classification \nstandards. See Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 25. \nThe Court’s  declination  of that function is entirely \ncongruent with 50 U.S.C. § 1872. To be sure, Section \n1872 reflects a legislative judgment that public access \nto  significant  FISC  opinions  is  desirable,  but  only \nwhen  the  DNI  is  satisfied  that  sensitive  national \nsecurity information is sufficiently protected.  In fact, \nthe provisions  of Section  1872 contradict  Movants’ \nargument  that  the  benefits of  open  access  to  such \nopinions outweigh the harms as a general matter. See \nGlobe Newspaper Co., 868  F.2d  at  509  (“The  First \nAmendment  right  of access  attaches  only to  those \ngovernmental  processes  that  as  a  general  matter \nbenefit from openness.”) (emphasis in original). \nThis Court concludes that “public access” to FISC \nopinions in foreign intelligence proceedings does not \nand would not play a “significant positive role in the \nfunctioning”  of  the  FISC,  In  re  Certification  of \nQuestions of Law to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3, \nparticularly with regard to classified information that \nthe Executive Branch would protect. Logic dictates \notherwise. \n127a \n\nIV.  THE COURT WILL NOT ORDER \nFURTHER REVIEW AS A MATTER OF \nDISCRETION. \nFISC Rule 62(a) states: \nThe  Judge  who  authored  an  order, \nopinion, or other decision may sua sponte \nor on motion by a party request that it be \npublished.  Upon  such  request,  the \nPresiding  Judge,  after  consulting  with \nother  Judges of the  Court,  may  direct \nthat an order, opinion or other decision \nbe  published.  Before  publication,  the \nCourt  may,  as  appropriate,  direct  the \nExecutive  Branch to  review  the  order, \nopinion, or other decision and redact it as \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  properly \nclassified  information  is appropriately \nprotected  pursuant to Executive Order \n13526 (or its successor). \nFISA  Ct.  R.  Proc.  62(a)  (emphasis  in  original). \nMovants assert that, “even if the Court holds that the \nFirst Amendment right of access does not attach . . ., \nit should nonetheless exercise its discretion—as it has \nin the past and in the public interest—to order the \ngovernment to conduct a declassification review of its \nopinions pursuant to Rule 62.” Mot. for Release of Ct. \nRecords at 27. In support of that assertion, Movants \ncite an earlier  instance  in which  the Court, as “an \nexercise  of discretion,”  directed  the  government  to \nsubmit proposed redactions of any opinion at issue so \nthat its author, “with the benefit of [such proposal], \nmay decide whether to propose publication pursuant \nto Rule  62(a).”  Id. (quoting  In re  Orders  of Court \nInterpreting  Section  215  of  Patriot  Act, 2013  WL \n54600644 at *8). \n128a \n\nThe  cited  case,  however,  presented  materially \ndifferent circumstances.  Here, the Executive Branch \nhas completed a declassification review of the opinions \nat  issue.  Consistent with that review, the opinions \nhave been made available to the public in redacted \n \nform31 and there is no particular reason to expect that \nfurther review will yield different results.  Under the \ncircumstances presented, the Court declines to direct \na second declassification review. \nV.  CONCLUSION. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss \nthe pending Motion for the Release of Court Records. \nA separate order accompanies this Opinion. \n \nFebruary 11, 2020 \n \n/s/ Rosemary M. Collyer \nJudge, U.S. Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court  \n                                            \n31 Indeed, the FISC has previously engaged in the Rule 62(a) \npublication process for two of the four opinions at issue.
