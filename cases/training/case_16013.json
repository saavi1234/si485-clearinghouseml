We should know probably in May.\" ECF No. 62 (transcript) at 2. The Court requests an update by June 8, 2018, on the funding request and how, if at all, prospects for settlement have been affected by that or any other factors. The parties are familiar with the thinking of the AASLD/IDSA and the CDC, as well as decisions that have been issued by courts to date on motions to dismiss and/or for class certification in similar cases in other jurisdictions. A resolution by the parties, perhaps in the form of a consent order that could be issued by the Court, might be something worth considering. by Judge R. Brooke Jackson on 5/25/18.

    "summary": "<p>On July 19, 2017, four prisoners suffering from the Hepatitis C virus who were under the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, sued the executive director of the CDOC, the chief medical officer of the CDOC, and the director of clinical and correctional services of the CDOC under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had denied the plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication in violation of the Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. </p><p>This case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher, but on August 1, 2017, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Kathleen M. Tafoya. Then, on September 19, 2017, because all parties did not consent to jurisdiction under Judge Tafoya, the case was reassigned to Judge R. Brooke Jackson.</p><p>On September 11, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding four plaintiffs and one defendant, the Interim Chief Medical Officer of the CDOC, without altering the claims or requests for relief.</p><p>On October 2, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege both the objective and subjective components of an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and unusual punishment. In congruence with this motion, the defendants filed a motion to stay discovery pending its resolution, but Judge Jackson denied the motion to stay discovery on October 27, 2017.</p><p>On February 7, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class defined as \"[a]ll current and future prisoners in the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections who have been or who will be diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C virus, who have at least 24 weeks or more remaining on their sentences and a life expectancy of more than one year, with the exception of prisoners who are already receiving or who have already completed treatment with Direct Acting Antiviral medications.\" </p><p>The parties submitted a joint notice of private settlement agreement on August 18, 2018. The contents of the settlement are not available through PACER, but Prison Legal News reports that under the terms of the settlement prison officials agreed to: 1) spend all available funding for 2018-19 in the amount of $20.5 million to treat prisoners with HCV; 2) reduce the threshold liver damage score to allow more prisoners to receive treatment; 3) provide another $20.5 million in treatment for 2019-20; 4) eliminate the drug and alcohol program precondition; and 5) remove the disciplinary action restriction. The CDOC also agreed to pay attorneysโ fees and costs totaling $175,000.</p><p>In response to the notice of settlement, the court dismissed as moot the pending motion for class certification and motion to dismiss. The parties jointly moved to administratively close the case on April 22, 2019. The motion was granted the following day. This case is now closed. </p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  CDOC intentionally and systematically delays and denies necessary medical care \nto prisoners suffering from chronic infection with the Hepatitis C virus (โHCVโ), thereby placing \nthem at substantial and unnecessary risk of severe illness and death. Since 2014, when the Food \nand Drug Administration (โFDAโ) approved breakthrough Direct Acting Anti-Viral (โDAAโ) \nmedications, a full cure for HCV has been available, with no significant adverse side effects. The \ncommunity standard of care, as endorsed by major medical associations, now requires treating all \nchronic HCV patients with DAAs. Yet CDOC denies these life-saving cures, without medical \njustification, to over 97% of the thousands of CDOC prisoners who need them, including Plaintiffs \nhere. \n2.  In 2016, Defendant Susan Tiona, CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer, stated that \nCDOCโs policy means that prisoners will continue to die from Hepatitis C for the next decade, and \nprisoners will continue to suffer adverse medical complications from HCV for an additional \ndecade. \n3.  CDOCโs  chilling  calculations,  and  its  policies  and  practices,  show  deliberate \nindifference to prisonersโ serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n4.  Plaintiffs are CDOC prisoners with chronic HCV infection who bring this action \non behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated prisoners. They seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 22\n \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) as Plaintiffsโ claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 arise under the laws of the United States \nand allege violations of the United States Constitution. \n6.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, because each of the Defendants is \ndomiciled in the District of Colorado and the acts and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims \noccurred in this District. \nIII. PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n7.  Plaintiff Ruben Aragon is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n8.  Plaintiff John Spring is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from  \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n9.  Plaintiff Robert Wieghard is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n10.  Plaintiff David Poole is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat.  \n11.  Each of the above named Plaintiffs has exhausted all administrative remedies \navailable to him, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a). \nDefendants \n12.  Defendant Rick Raemisch is the Executive Director of CDOC. In that capacity, he \nhas oversight and authority over all aspects of the management and governance of the entire \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 22\n \nCDOC, including each Colorado penitentiary. He has overall responsibility for the CDOC budget \nand for ensuring the delivery of necessary medical care for the serious medical needs of all \nprisoners in the custody of CDOC. He is sued in his official capacity. At all relevant times, \nDefendant Raemisch has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n13.  Defendant Susan Tiona is CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer.  She is responsible for \noverseeing the provision of medical care in CDOC. Dr. Tiona specifically approved and signed \nCDOCโs  Clinical  Standards  and  Procedures  for  Hepatitis  C  Evaluation,  Management  and \nTreatment that are at issue in this case. She is sued in her official capacity. At all relevant times, \nDr. Tiona has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n14.  Defendant Renae Jordan is the Director of Clinical and Correctional Services of \nCDOC. She is responsible for overseeing the provision of medical care in CDOC. Like Dr. Tiona, \nDefendant Jordan specifically approved and signed CDOCโs Clinical Standards and Procedures \nfor Hepatitis C Evaluation, Management and Treatment. Defendant Jordan is sued in her official \ncapacity. At all relevant times she has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \nIV. FACTS \nA.  The Disease. \n15.  HCV is the most common blood-borne viral infection in the United States. An \nestimated 3.2 million people in the country are chronically infected with HCV. In 2013 the virus \ncaused more deaths than sixty other infectious diseases combined, including HIV, pneumococcal \ndisease, and tuberculosis.  \n16.  The liver plays a crucial role in processing nutrients, filtering toxins from the blood, \npreventing disease, and making possible essentially all metabolic processes in the body. Chronic \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 22\n \nHCV infection causes inflammation of the liver, eventually, if untreated, leading to diminished \nliver function, liver failure and liver cancer, requiring consideration for a liver transplant.   \n17.  There are several different genotypes of HCV. The genotype determines which of \nthe many DAA medications available today are administered to the patient. Genotype 1 is the most \ncommon type of HCV in the United States. \n18.  The severity of liver damage due to HCV is commonly described by the Metavir \nfibrosis score (โMFSโ), which assigns a number from 0 to 4 to correspond to the degree of scarring \nof the liver caused by the progression of the disease. An MFS of F0 indicates no liver scarring, \nand F1 indicates minimal liver scarring. F2 is an intermediate stage of fibrosis. A score of F3 \nindicates severe fibrosis, and F4 indicates cirrhosis. \n19.  Chronic HCV is an inflammatory disease in and of itself, regardless of the degree \nof liver scarring. At all stages of liver fibrosis, HCV is associated with adverse health effects. Left \nuntreated, it increases a personโs risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, B cell lymphoma and \nother cancers, Parkinsonโs disease, and kidney disease. Likewise, chronic HCV often causes other \nextrahepatic manifestations such as chronic fatigue, severe depression, and arthritis. For persons \nwith chronic HCV, each day without treatment increases the likelihood of these conditions. \nB.  Treatment. \n20.  For years, the best treatment for HCV was a combination of two drugs: interferon \nand ribavirin.  This treatment, often referred to as โcombination therapy,โ lasted 48 weeks and \ncaused serious side effects such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and severe depression.  Worse, the \ntreatment had a low effectiveness rate.  Combination therapy only had a less than 60% success rate \nagainst HCV genotype 1. \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 22\n \n21.  In 2011 the FDA approved two protease inhibitors that increased the likelihood of \nsuccessful treatment when either was added to combination therapy.  The so-called โtriple therapyโ \nbecame the standard of care for genotype 1 patients.  Triple therapy lasted just as long as \ncombination therapy and had the same and additional severe side effects. \n22.  In 2013 and 2014 the landscape for treating HCV changed dramatically.  The FDA \napproved the use of DAA medications for the treatment of HCV.  These drugs now include, but \nare not limited to, Sovaldi, Harvoni, Olysio, and Viekira Pak.  All of these drugs were designated \nas โbreakthrough therapiesโ by the FDA, an official classification that is reserved for drugs proven \nto provide substantial improvement over available therapies for patients with serious or life-\nthreatening diseases. \n23.  DAA medications generally reduce treatment length to eight to twelve weeks.  They \ndramatically reduce adverse side effects, and they have well over a 90% success rate in curing the \ndisease. \n24.  According  to  evidence-based,  expert-developed  guidelines  published  by  the \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of \nAmerica (โAASLD/IDSA Guidelinesโ), DAAs are now โrecommended for all patients with \nchronic HCV infection,โ with the narrow exception of patients โwith short life expectancies that \ncannot  be  remediated  by  treating  HCV,  by  transplantation,  or  by  other  directed  therapy.โ  \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases & Infectious Diseases Society of America, \nWhen and in Whom to Initiate HCV Therapy.  Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and \nTreating  Hepatitis  C  (July  6,  2016)  (emphasis  added),  available  at \nhttp://www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/when-whom [accessed July 19, 2017]. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 22\n \n25.  The AASLD/IDSA Guidelines specifically urge treatment with DAAs in the very \nearly stages of the disease. They explicitly repudiate the idea that DAA drugs should be prescribed \nonly for patients with significant liver damage, and instead urge that virtually all individuals \ninfected by HCV receive DAA treatments regardless of their fibrosis score. \n26.  The  AASLD/IDSA  Guidelines  represent  the  professionally-accepted  clinical \nstandard of care for treatment of HCV in the United States and in Colorado. Medicare, the U.S. \nDepartment  of  Veterans  Affairs,  and  major  health  insurance  providers  all  follow  the \nAASLD/IDSA Guidelines by providing DAAs to all persons with chronic HCV infections, except \nthose with short life expectancies. \nC.  HCV in the Colorado Department of Corrections. \n27.  HCV is more prevalent in prisons than in the general population. One study \nestimates that between 12% and 35% of the national prison population is infected with the virus. \nNational Hepatitis Corrections Network, An Overview of Hepatitis C in Prisons and Jails, (Feb. \n22,  2016),  available  at  http://www.hcvinprison.org/resources/71-main-content/content/191-\nhepcprison#_edn3 [accessed July 19, 2017]. \n28.  According to the CDOCโs monthly inmate population report, as of June 2017 the \ndepartment  listed  its  total  population  of  incarcerated  prisoners  as  20,2010,  available  at \nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdoc/departmental-reports-and-statistics (Dashboard Measures) \n[accessed July 19, 2017].  As of November 2016, CDOC reported that it was aware of 2,280 \nprisoners who had been diagnosed with HCV. \n29.  When CDOC provides treatment for chronic HCV infection, it does provide DAA \nmedications.  However, CDOC provides treatment with DAAs to very few prisoners with chronic \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 22\n \ninfection.  Instead, CDOC deliberately and intentionally delays and denies treatment to the \noverwhelming majority of prisoners who are living with chronic HCV, including Plaintiffs here. \n1.  Determining eligibility for treatment. \n30.  Defendantsโ written policy, titled Clinical Standards and Procedures for Hepatitis \nC Evaluation, Management and Treatment (โStandardsโ) memorializes CDOCโs practice of \nwithholding necessary medications from the overwhelming majority of prisoners who need them.   \n31.  As a first step in screening prisoners for โtreatment eligibility,โ CDOC relies on a \nblood test, known as the APRI score that roughly correlates to the degree of liver fibrosis. A \nprisonerโs  APRI  score  is  the  ratio  derived  by  comparing  the  prisonerโs  level  of  aspartate \naminotransferase (โASTโ), an enzyme in the blood, with the usual amount of AST in a healthy \npersonโs blood and the prisonerโs platelet count.  \n32.  According to Defendantsโ Standards, prisoners with an APRI score below 0.7 are \nnot eligible for treatment and will not be considered for treatment.    \n33.  The Standards specify that in order to be considered for treatment, prisoners must \nhave an APRI score of at least 0.7.  An APRI score of 0.7 is roughly equivalent to a fibrosis score \nof F2.  A lower APRI score, however, does not necessarily indicate an absence of significant \nfibrosis.   \n34.  Even an APRI score of 0.7 or greater, which is evidence of significant fibrotic liver \nchanges, only makes a prisoner eligible for referral to the CDOC Infectious Disease Committee \n(โCommitteeโ) for โconsiderationโ for treatment.  \n35.  Before referral, however, the Standards require that a prisoner with an APRI score \nof 0.7 or higher must first complete a program of alcohol and drug treatment provided by CDOC.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 22\n \n36.  According to the Standards, the Alcohol and Drug Services Program determines \nwhich level of alcohol and drug treatment classes are โappropriateโ for a specific prisoner.  The \nStandards refer to Administrative Regulation (โARโ) 700-20, which is titled Alcohol and Drug \nServices Program.  According to that AR, the CDOC administers screening instruments that assign \none of several โsubstance abuse service levelsโ to the prisoner.  These levels include level 1, which \nis โno treatmentโ; level 2, which is โeducation and increased urinalysisโ; and level 3, which is \nโweekly  outpatient  treatment.โ    Level  4  is  divided  into  four  sub-levels,  4a  through  4d, \ncharacterized by increasingly intensive treatment.  Level 5 is reserved for prisoners with a severe \npsychiatric or medical issue that warrant suspension of substance abuse treatment pending a \nmedical or mental health intervention.  Thus, the most intensive treatment level is level 4d, known \nas the Therapeutic Community program.    \n37.  Despite  the  written  Standards,  in  its  predominant  practice,  CDOC  requires \nprisoners to complete the Therapeutic Community program as a prerequisite to treatment.  Thus, \nCDOC  requires  the  Therapeutic  Community  program  even  when  CDOCโs  individualized \nscreening instruments determine that a prisonerโs โsubstance abuse service levelโ does not require \ntreatment as intensive as that provided in the Therapeutic Community program. \n38.  There is no medical justification for CDOCโs requirement of substance abuse \ntreatment as a prerequisite to HCV treatment. The requirement unjustifiably delays a prisonerโs \nability to be even considered for treatment under CDOCโs Standards. \n39.  The waitlist for the Therapeutic Community program, if it is offered at all in a \nparticular facility, is approximately one and a half years, and the program takes one year to \ncomplete.  Thus, for a prisoner with an APRI score of 0.7, referral to the Committee could take as \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 22\n \nlong as two and a half years.  Because some prisons do not offer the required program, a prisoner \nmay encounter additional unjustified delay while waiting for a transfer, if a transfer is even \npossible, to a prison that does offer the required classes.  \n40.  Additionally, to be โconsideredโ for DAA medication treatment, the Standards \nrequire that a prisoner must demonstrate what CDOC regards as โan absence of high-risk behaviorโ \nduring the pendency of the alcohol and drug treatment.  This standardless requirement has no \nmedical justification.  CDOC regards any disciplinary offense involving alcohol, prescription \ndrugs,  illegal  drugs,  tattooing,  or  sexual  activity  as  evidence  of  โhigh  risk  behaviorโ  that \ndisqualifies the prisoner for treatment until alcohol and drug classes are repeated and a minimum \nof one year has passed since the last โoffense.โ  In such a case, a prisoner with an APRI score of \n0.7 could wait as long as three and a half years before he will even be considered for medical \ntreatment. \n2.  The prisoner selection process. \n41.  The prisoner must jump through the foregoing hoops before he is even referred to \nthe Committee to be โconsideredโ for possible treatment.  According to the Standards, the \nCommittee meets four times a year and selects a โquarterly treatment cohort.โ  If a prisoner is not \nselected for treatment โbut remains eligible for treatment,โ the prisonerโs application packet is \nreturned to the application โpoolโ and is considered for a future quarterly meeting.  There is no \nguarantee that a prisoner who is โeligibleโ for treatment or โconsideredโ for treatment will actually \nreceive DAA medications.  Under CDOCโs policies, a prisoner with chronic HCV can comply \nwith each and every precondition for treatment yet still be denied access to DAA medications, \nwith no medical justification for the denial.    \n10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 22\n \n42.  No matter how many prisoners need treatment according to medical standards, and \nno matter how many prisoners are โeligibleโ for treatment under CDOCโs unjustifiably restrictive \nStandards, CDOC further limits treatment by relying on an artificial quota.  On information and \nbelief, in early 2017, that quota was 30 prisoners per year.     \n3.  Treatment in practice. \n43.  HCV was a contributing factor in six prisoner deaths department wide in CDOCโs \nfiscal year 2013-14. The disease contributed to five deaths in fiscal year 2014-15. In fiscal year \n2015-16, HCV contributed to seven deaths department wide. \n44.  Despite these deaths, CDOC deliberately chooses to limit the number of prisoners \nto whom it provides the curative and life-saving DAA treatments for HCV.  No matter how many \nprisoners manage to qualify as โeligibleโ for treatment under CDOCโs unjustifiably restrictive \nStandards, CDOC chooses to supply only a limited amount of DAAs to an extremely limited \nnumber of prisoners.  As a result, CDOC is deliberately choosing to allow additional CDOC \nprisoners to die from untreated HCV.   \n45.  Last year, in an email to then-Senator Pat Steadman, Defendant Tiona explained \nthat CDOC planned to โcontinue to identify and prioritize [only] the sickest individuals for \ntreatment each quarter.โ That plan, Defendant Tiona stated, โshould be effective in eliminating \nDepartment-wide deaths from hepatitis C within the next decade, and โฆ should be effective in \neliminating all additional complications from hepatitis C by 2035.โ (emphasis added).    \n46.  There is no medical justification for CDOCโs decision to withhold a life-saving \ncure from the thousands of prisoners living with chronic HCV.   \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 22\n \n47.  Using CDOCโs overly restrictive criterion of an APRI score greater than 0.7, \nDefendant Tiona estimates that 735 prisoners โare candidates for treatment to cure their Hepatitis \nC infection.โ  If CDOC continues to treat only 30 prisoners each year, treatment of this group will \ntake more than 24 years.  Meanwhile, CDOCโs Standards deny treatment altogether for more than \n1,500 prisoners whose APRI score does not reach CDOCโs arbitrarily-set minimum.   \n48.  CDOC has announced plans, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, to begin DAA therapy for \nas many as 70 prisoners.  Despite this incremental improvement, Defendants remain deliberately \nindifferent to prisonersโ serious medical needs.  Treating 70 prisoners per year means that CDOC \nwill take more than 10 years to treat the 735 prisoners whose APRI scores today already indicate \nadvancing fibrosis, without accounting for new prisoners with HCV who enter the CDOC system, \nor current prisoners whose advancing APRI scores during that 10 years move them into the greater-\nthan-0.7 group.  Defendant Tiona has acknowledged that waiting that long to complete treatment \nfor this group of prisoners risks โpermanent damage to the liver which could result in life-long \ncomplications, even after cure.โ1  Moreover, CDOCโs plan continues to deny treatment to the more \nthan 1,500 prisoners whose APRI score does not rise to the level of 0.7. \n49.  Defendants refuse to meet the community standard of care, which requires that they \nprovide  treatment  to  all  those  prisoners  with  chronic  HCV  infections,  including  Plaintiffs.  \nDefendantsโ public assertions that the Departmentโs policies and practices are consistent with the \nAASLDโs guidelines are false, in that the Departmentโs policies and practices fail to ensure that \nall prisoners with chronic HCV infection who are medically appropriate for DAA treatment are \ngiven these life-saving medications.  Rather, Defendants have deliberately adopted a budget that \n                                            \n1 Letter dated January 31, 2017, โTo Whom It May Concern,โ from Susan M. Tiona, M.D. \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 22\n \nfails to provide DAAs to the overwhelming majority of prisoners who need them.  To facilitate \nthis budgetary choice, Defendants have promulgated, implemented, and enforced policies and \npractices that are deliberately designed, unjustifiably, to delay and deny necessary medical \ntreatment to all but a small fraction of the prisoners with chronic HCV infections.  In doing so, \nDefendants demonstrate systemic, deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs \nand the class of prisoners with chronic HCV, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \nD.  Allegations Regarding Named Plaintiffs. \n1.  Plaintiff Ruben Aragon. \n50.  Plaintiff Ruben Aragon is 58 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in 1998.  Mr. \nAragon entered CDOC in 2011 and is serving a 70-year sentence.  He is currently incarcerated at \nthe Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility. \n51.  CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Aragon requested treatment for his chronic HCV. \n52.  Mr. Aragon has been told that his blood tests demonstrate that his APRI score is \nsufficiently high to be considered for treatment by the Committee.   \n53.  Mr. Aragon had previously completed a six-month Substance Abuse Education \nProgram while in CDOC.  Nonetheless, he has been told he will not be considered for treatment \nunless he also completes the Therapeutic Community program.   \n54.  The Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility, where Mr. Aragon is currently housed, \ndoes not offer the Therapeutic Community program.  \n55.  Mr. Aragon challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Aragon has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 22\n \n2.  Plaintiff John Spring. \n56.  Plaintiff John Spring is 61 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in 2004.  Mr. \nSpring entered CDOC in 1979 and is serving a life sentence.  He is currently incarcerated at the \nSterling Correctional Facility (โSCFโ). \n57.  CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Spring requested treatment for his chronic HCV. \n58.  CDOCโs restrictive policies have taken Mr. Spring on a bureaucratic roller coaster \nride.  CDOC medical staff told Mr. Spring that he was eligible to be โconsideredโ for treatment, \nthen not eligible, then again was eligible, then ineligible, then eligible once again. \n59.  On June 29, 2015, Nurse Practitioner Helene Christner counseled Mr. Spring \nregarding his HCV and informed him that he met all criteria for treatment.  She completed CDOCโs \nHepatitis C Evaluation Worksheet and specifically indicated that he qualified due to his APRI \nscore and his completion of alcohol and drug classes. \n60.  Nevertheless, on December 7, 2015, Nurse Practitioner Christner told Mr. Spring \nthat he probably would not be approved for Hepatitis C treatment.  She indicated that according to \nhis blood tests, he had not sustained sufficient damage to his liver to require treatment.  In Mr. \nSpringโs medical records, she wrote โthat with his AP[R]I score below 1.0 he does not meet the \nDOC criteria for treatment . . . .โ   \n61.  The nurse practitionerโs notation in Mr. Springโs medical records reflected a \nmisunderstanding of CDOCโs written policy.  At the time, the protocol said that a prisoner would \nbe โconsideredโ for treatment if the APRI score was higher than 0.7.   \n62.  Although Mr. Springโs 2015 records indicate that he had already satisfied CDOCโs \nrequirement of completing alcohol and drug classes before receiving treatment, the Committee \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 22\n \napparently disagreed.  In February, 2016, the Committee determined that Mr. Spring would not \nreceive treatment for his HCV until he first completed a CDOC drug and alcohol program โand \nany recommended treatment.โ   \n63.  To satisfy the Committee, Mr. Spring completed yet another drug and alcohol class.  \n64.  After Mr. Spring completed the class, Nurse Practitioner Christner told him that his \nโlevelsโ had dropped and that he no longer qualified for treatment for HCV. \n65.  Several months later, Nurse Practitioner Christner informed Mr. Spring that he once \nagain qualified for HCV treatment. \n66.  Mr. Spring still has not received treatment for his chronic HCV, which causes him \nfatigue. \n67.  Mr. Spring challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the CDOC \ngrievance process. The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  Accordingly, \nMr. Spring has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n3.  Robert Wieghard. \n68.  Plaintiff Robert Wieghard is 61 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in the mid-\n1990s.  Mr. Wieghard entered CDOC in 1982 and is serving a life sentence.  He is currently \nincarcerated at the Bent County Correctional Facility. \n69.  CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Wieghard requested treatment for his chronic \nHCV. \n70.  Mr. Wieghardโs APRI score is sufficiently high that he could be โconsideredโ for \ntreatment under CDOCโs overly-restrictive policies.  Nevertheless, CDOC has refused to provide \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 22\n \ntreatment because he has not completed classes on alcohol and substance abuse that the Committee \nregards as satisfactory. \n71.  Mr. Wieghard has completed CDOCโs Addiction Rehabilitation Program (โARPโ).  \nNevertheless, in a December, 2015 letter to Mr. Wieghard, a CDOC Infection Control Nurse stated \nthat ARP is โno longer considered an acceptable treatment method.โ  The letter stated that before \nMr. Wieghard may receive treatment for his HCV, he must complete a Therapeutic Community \nprogram.    \n72.  At the time that Mr. Wieghard received that letter, he was housed at the Arkansas \nValley Correctional Facility, which did not offer a Therapeutic Community program. \n73.  In May, 2016, Mr. Wieghard was transferred to the Buena Vista Correctional \nFacility so that he could participate in the Therapeutic Community program there.   \n74.  Because of a physical disability, however, Mr. Wieghard was unable to negotiate \nthe stairs at Buena Vista Correctional Facility.  As a result, Mr. Wieghard was then transferred to \nthe Bent County Correctional Facility. \n75.  The  Therapeutic  Community  program  is  not  offered  at  the  Bent  County \nCorrectional Facility, where Mr. Wieghard remains housed today.  \n76.  Thus, without medical justification, CDOC refuses to provide treatment to Mr. \nWieghard unless he completes a Therapeutic Community program.  Yet CDOC houses Mr. \nWieghard in a facility that does not offer that program.   \n77.  Mr. Wieghard challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Weighard has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 22\n \n4.  Plaintiff David Poole. \n78.   Plaintiff David Poole is 52 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV more than \ntwenty years ago.  Mr. Poole entered CDOC in 2012 and is currently serving a seven-year sentence.  \nHe is currently incarcerated at SCF. \n79.  CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Poole requested treatment for his chronic HCV. \n80.  In 2012 and 2013, Mr. Poole requested treatment for his Hepatitis C while he was \nhoused at CDOCโs Four Mile Correctional Center in Caรฑon City, Colorado.  Treatment was \nrefused.  Officials there told him his โlevelsโ were not high enough, but they did not say what \nthose levels were. \n81.  Defendants have continued to deny Mr. Pooleโs requests for treatment at SCF, \nwhere he has been housed since August, 2016. \n82.  In October, 2016, SCF medical staff incorrectly calculated Mr. Pooleโs APRI score.  \nBecause of the error, Mr. Poole was regarded, erroneously, as having an APRI score below 0.7, \nthe  threshold  that  CDOCโs  restrictive  policies  regard  as  the  minimum  for  treatment  to  be \nโconsidered.โ  Nurse Practitioner Christner told Mr. Poole that his โlevelsโ were not high enough \nto warrant treatment. \n83.  Mr. Pooleโs APRI score, calculated correctly, indicates that he is far above the \nminimum that CDOC requires for a prisoner to be โconsideredโ for treatment. \n84.  Mr. Pooleโs health has been steadily declining.  He attributes the decline in his \nhealth to his untreated chronic HCV infection.  He has experienced bloating in his abdomen that \nhe attributes to his worsening condition from HCV.  He has also developed a rash that has \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 22\n \ncontinued to spread.  His entire body itches constantly.  When he scratches his skin, he develops \nopen sores, and he is concerned about the risk of spreading his HCV infection as a result.   \n85.  Mr. Poole challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the CDOC \ngrievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  Accordingly, \nMr. Poole has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \nV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n86.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on behalf of themselves, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P., \n23(a) and 23(b)(2), a class of: \nAll current and future prisoners in the custody of CDOC who have been or will be \ndiagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C, who have at least 24 weeks or more remaining on their \nsentences and a life expectancy of more than one year, with the exception of prisoners who \nare already receiving or have already completed treatment with DAA medications. \n87.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy the wrongdoing of \nDefendants for themselves and for all members of the putative class. \n88.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are satisfied by this action. \n89.  As of November, 2016, CDOC reports that 2,280 prisoners had been diagnosed \nwith HCV.  Because not all current prisoners have been tested, CDOCโs number is undoubtedly \nlow.  The overwhelming majority of these 2,280 prisoners have chronic HCV.  In addition, the \nclass includes future prisoners with chronic Hepatitis C.  Accordingly, members of the class are \nso numerous as to make joinder impracticable. \n90.  There are questions of law and fact common to the entire class because the actions \nof Defendants complained of herein are applicable to the entire class.  These common questions \ninclude, but are not limited to: \na.  Whether chronic infection with HCV represents a serious medical need; \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 22\n \nb.  Whether the community standard of care requires treatment with DAAs for \nall persons diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C, except persons with a life \nexpectancy of less than one year; \nc.  Whether Defendants have knowingly employed policies and practices that \nunjustifiably delay or deny treatment for chronic HCV; \nd.  Whether Defendantsโ failure to provide treatment to Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the class in accordance with the prevailing standard of care has \nput Plaintiffs and members of the class at risk of serious harm; \ne.  Whether Defendants are deliberately indifferent to class membersโ serious \nmedical needs; \nf.  Whether Defendantsโ policies and practices with regard to HCV treatment \nviolates class membersโ rights under the Eighth Amendment. \n91.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the members of the class because Plaintiffs and \nother members of the class were injured by the same wrongful treatment policies, protocols, and \npractices of Defendants as set forth herein.  Plaintiffsโ claims arise from the same course of conduct \nthat give rise to the claims of the members of the class and are based on the same legal theories. \n92.  Plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n93.  The relief requested herein as applied to all members of the class would be proper.  \nDefendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that final \ninjunctive or declaratory relief with regard the class as a whole would be appropriate.  Certification \nof the class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) is therefore proper. \n   \n19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 22\n \nVI. CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nVIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION \n94.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n95.  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees all citizens, \nincluding Plaintiffs and members of the class, the right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment. \n96.  By the policies and practices set forth herein, Defendants subject Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the class to a substantial risk of serious harm and untimely death from inadequate \nmedical care.  Defendants have been and are aware of all the deprivations complained of herein, \nhave adopted policies and practices that institutionalize those deprivations, and have been and are \ndeliberately indifferent to the deprivations.  Defendantsโ acts and omissions in failing to provide \nadequate medical care constitute deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners \ninfected with HCV, in violation of Plaintiffsโ and members of the classโs rights under the Eighth \nAmendment. \n97.  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to a declaration that \nDefendantsโ written and unwritten policies, customs, and practices exhibit deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffsโ serious medical needs.  Plaintiffs and the class are also entitled to an injunction \nrequiring Defendants to adopt policies and practices that adequately provide for the serious \nmedical needs of prisoners with chronic HCV. \n98.  Plaintiffs and members of the class have suffered and will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendantsโ wrongful policies and practices, unless granted the \nrelief that they request. \n20 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 22\n \nVII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n99.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court : \na.  Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2); \nb.  Declare that the policies and practices of Defendants, as set forth herein, are \nin violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class under the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; \nc.  Enjoin Defendants, their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting \nin concert with them, from subjecting Plaintiffs and members of the class to \nthe unconstitutional policies and practices described herein; \nd.  Order Defendants to develop and implement, as soon as is practicable and \nin no even later than three months of the date of such order, a plan to \neliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class suffer due to the unconstitutional policies and practices described \nherein.  Defendantsโ  plan  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  a  hepatitis-C \ntreatment policy that comports with the community standard of care and the \nadvice of medical experts and that ensures the Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass are treated with appropriate direct-acting antiviral drugs; \ne.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, reasonable attorneysโ fees, and \nlitigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and other applicable law; \nand \n21 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-GPG   Document 1   Filed 07/19/17   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 22\n \nf.

INTRODUCTION\n1. CDOC intentionally and systematically delays and denies necessary medical care\nto prisoners suffering from chronic infection with the Hepatitis C virus (โHCVโ), thereby placing \nthem at substantial and unnecessary risk of severe illness and death. Since 2014, when the Food \nand Drug Administration (โFDAโ) approved breakthrough Direct Acting Anti-Viral (โDAAโ) \nmedications, a full cure for HCV has been available, with no significant adverse side effects. The \ncommunity standard of care, as endorsed by major medical associations, now requires treating \nall chronic HCV patients with DAAs. Yet CDOC denies these life-saving cures, without medical \njustification,  to  over  97%  of  the  thousands  of  CDOC  prisoners  who  need  them,  including \nPlaintiffs here. \n2. In 2016, when she was CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Susan Tiona, stated\nthat CDOCโs policy means that prisoners will continue to die from Hepatitis C for the next \ndecade, and prisoners will continue to suffer adverse medical complications from HCV for an \nadditional decade. \n3. CDOCโs  chilling  calculations,  and  its  policies  and  practices,  show  deliberate\nindifference to prisonersโ serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n2 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 25\n4. Plaintiffs are CDOC prisoners with chronic HCV infection who bring this action \non behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated prisoners. They seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) as Plaintiffsโ claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 arise under the laws of the United States \nand allege violations of the United States Constitution. \n6. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, because each of the Defendants is \ndomiciled in the District of Colorado and the acts and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims \noccurred in this District. \nIII. PARTIES \nPlaintiffs\n7. Plaintiff Ruben Aragon is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n8. Plaintiff John Spring is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from  \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n9.

Plaintiff Aaron Miller is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n13. Plaintiff George Miller is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n14. Plaintiff Edward Kaneta is a prisoner in the custody of CDOC.  He suffers from \nchronic HCV infection, which CDOC refuses to treat. \n15. Each of the above named Plaintiffs has exhausted all administrative remedies \navailable to him, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a). \nDefendants \n16. Defendant Rick Raemisch is the Executive Director of CDOC. In that capacity, he \nhas oversight and authority over all aspects of the management and governance of the entire \nCDOC, including each Colorado penitentiary. He has overall responsibility for the CDOC budget \nand for ensuring the delivery of necessary medical care for the serious medical needs of all \nprisoners in the custody of CDOC. He is sued in his official capacity. At all relevant times, \nDefendant Raemisch has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n17. Defendant Rishi Ariola-Tirella is CDOCโs Interim Chief Medical Officer.  He is \nresponsible  for  overseeing  the  provision  of  medical  care  in  CDOC.    Dr.  Ariola-Tirella  \nspecifically  approved  and  signed  CDOCโs  revised  Clinical  Standards  and  Procedures  for \nHepatitis  C  Evaluation,  Management  and  Treatment,  dated  August,  2017,  a  protocol \npromulgated by CDOC after the filing and service of the initial Complaint in this case.  He is \nsued in his official capacity. At all relevant times, Dr. Ariola-Tirella has acted and will continue \nto act under color of state law.  For many years prior to the filing of this lawsuit and through the \n4 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 25\nearly months of 2017, Dr. Susan Tiona was CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer.  In this First \nAmended Class Action Complaint, all comments, quotations, actions and inactions attributed to \nDr. Tiona were made and carried out while she served as CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer and in \nher official capacity as CDOCโs Chief Medical Officer.  Dr. Tiona specifically approved and \nsigned several prior versions of CDOCโs Clinical Standards and Procedures for Hepatitis C \nEvaluation, Management and Treatment, including the version dated November, 2016, that was \nin effect when this lawsuit was filed. \n18. Defendant Renae Jordan is the Director of Clinical and Correctional Services of \nCDOC.  She is responsible for overseeing the provision of medical care in CDOC.  Defendant \nJordan  specifically  approved  and  signed  both  the  November,  2016,  and  the  August,  2017, \nversions of CDOCโs Clinical Standards and Procedures for Hepatitis C Evaluation, Management \nand Treatment.  Defendant Jordan is sued in her official capacity.  At all relevant times she has \nacted and will continue to act under color of state law. \nIV. FACTS \nA.  The Disease. \n19. HCV is the most common blood-borne viral infection in the United States. An \nestimated 3.2 million people in the country are chronically infected with HCV. In 2013 the virus \ncaused more deaths than sixty other infectious diseases combined, including HIV, pneumococcal \ndisease, and tuberculosis.  \n20. The liver plays a crucial role in processing nutrients, filtering toxins from the \nblood, preventing disease, and making possible essentially all metabolic processes in the body. \nChronic HCV infection causes inflammation of the liver, eventually, if untreated, leading to \n5 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 25\ndiminished  liver  function,  liver  failure  and  liver  cancer,  requiring  consideration  for  a  liver \ntransplant.   \n21. There are several different genotypes of HCV. The genotype determines which of \nthe many DAA medications available today are administered to the patient. Genotype 1 is the \nmost common type of HCV in the United States. \n22. The severity of liver damage due to HCV is commonly described by the Metavir \nfibrosis score (โMFSโ), which assigns a number from 0 to 4 to correspond to the degree of \nscarring of the liver caused by the progression of the disease. An MFS of F0 indicates no liver \nscarring, and F1 indicates minimal liver scarring. F2 is an intermediate stage of fibrosis. A score \nof F3 indicates severe fibrosis, and F4 indicates cirrhosis. \n23. Chronic HCV is an inflammatory disease in and of itself, regardless of the degree \nof liver scarring. At all stages of liver fibrosis, HCV is associated with adverse health effects. \nLeft  untreated,  it  increases  a  personโs  risk  of  developing  heart  disease,  diabetes,  B  cell \nlymphoma and other cancers, Parkinsonโs disease, and kidney disease. Likewise, chronic HCV \noften causes other extrahepatic manifestations such as chronic fatigue, severe depression, and \narthritis. For persons with chronic HCV, each day without treatment increases the likelihood of \nthese conditions. \nB.  Treatment. \n24. For years, the best treatment for HCV was a combination of two drugs: interferon \nand ribavirin.  This treatment, often referred to as โcombination therapy,โ lasted 48 weeks and \ncaused serious side effects such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and severe depression.  Worse, the \n6 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 25\ntreatment had a low effectiveness rate.  Combination therapy only had a less than 60% success \nrate against HCV genotype 1. \n25. In 2011 the FDA approved two protease inhibitors that increased the likelihood of \nsuccessful treatment when either was  added to combination therapy.  The so-called โtriple \ntherapyโ became the standard of care for genotype 1 patients.  Triple therapy lasted just as long \nas combination therapy and had the same and additional severe side effects. \n26. In 2013 and 2014 the landscape for treating HCV changed dramatically.  The \nFDA approved the use of DAA medications for the treatment of HCV.  These drugs now include, \nbut are not limited to, Sovaldi, Harvoni, Olysio, and Viekira Pak.  All of these drugs were \ndesignated as โbreakthrough therapiesโ by the FDA, an official classification that is reserved for \ndrugs  proven to provide substantial improvement over available therapies  for patients with \nserious or life-threatening diseases. \n27. DAA medications generally reduce treatment length to eight to twelve weeks.  \nThey dramatically reduce adverse side effects, and they have well over a 90% success rate in \ncuring the disease. \n28. According  to  evidence-based,  expert-developed  guidelines  published  by  the \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of \nAmerica (โAASLD/IDSA Guidelinesโ), DAAs are now โrecommended for all patients with \nchronic HCV infection,โ with the narrow exception of patients โwith short life expectancies that \ncannot  be  remediated  by  treating  HCV,  by  transplantation,  or  by  other  directed  therapy.โ  \nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases & Infectious Diseases Society of America, \nWhen and in Whom to Initiate HCV Therapy.

The AASLD/IDSA Guidelines specifically urge treatment with DAAs in the very \nearly  stages  of  the  disease.  They  explicitly  repudiate  the  idea  that  DAA  drugs  should  be \nprescribed only for patients with significant liver damage, and instead urge that virtually all \nindividuals infected by HCV receive DAA treatments regardless of their fibrosis score. \n30. The  AASLD/IDSA  Guidelines  represent  the  professionally-accepted  clinical \nstandard of care for treatment of HCV in the United States and in Colorado. Medicare, the U.S. \nDepartment  of  Veterans  Affairs,  and  major  health  insurance  providers  all  follow  the \nAASLD/IDSA Guidelines by providing DAAs to all persons with chronic HCV infections, \nexcept those with short life expectancies. \nC.  HCV in the Colorado Department of Corrections. \n31. HCV is more prevalent in prisons than in the general population. One study \nestimates that between 12% and 35% of the national prison population is infected with the virus. \nNational Hepatitis Corrections Network, An Overview of Hepatitis C in Prisons and Jails, (Feb. \n22,  2016),  available  at http://www.hcvinprison.org/resources/71-main-content/content/191-\nhepcprison#_edn3 [accessed July 19, 2017]. \n32. According to the CDOCโs monthly inmate population report, as of June 30, 2017 \nthe  department  listed  its  total  population  of  incarcerated  prisoners  as  20,101,  available  at\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdoc/departmental-reports-and-statistics (Dashboard \nMeasures) [accessed July 19, 2017].  As of November 2016, CDOC reported that it was aware of \n2,280 prisoners who had been diagnosed with HCV. \n8 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 25\n33. When CDOC provides treatment for chronic HCV infection, it does provide DAA \nmedications.    However,  CDOC  provides  treatment  with  DAAs  to  very  few  prisoners  with \nchronic infection.  Instead, CDOC deliberately and intentionally delays and denies treatment to \nthe overwhelming majority of prisoners who are living with chronic HCV, including Plaintiffs \nhere. \n1.  Determining eligibility for treatment. \n34. Defendantsโ  written  policy,  titled  Standards  for  Hepatitis  C  Evaluation, \nManagement  and  Treatment  (โStandardsโ)  memorializes  CDOCโs  practice  of  withholding \nnecessary medications from the overwhelming majority of prisoners who need them.  As of the \ntime of filing of the initial Complaint in this case, the Standards in force were those approved in \nNovember 2016.  After the commencement of this case, CDOC promulgated a revised version of \nthe Standards, effective August 2017.  The August 2017 Standards modified some of CDOCโs \nprocedures but failed to cure the fundamental constitutional violation that prompts Plaintiffs to \nbring this lawsuit: CDOC continues to delay and deny necessary medical treatment that accords \nwith the community standard of care to the Plaintiffs and similarly situated prisoners suffering \nfrom  chronic  HCV.    The  August  2017  protocols  are  referred  to  herein  as  the  โRevised \nStandards.โ \n35. As a first step in screening prisoners for โtreatment eligibility,โ CDOC relies on a \nblood test, known as the APRI score that roughly correlates to the degree of liver fibrosis. A \nprisonerโs  APRI  score  is  the  ratio  derived  by  comparing  the  prisonerโs  level  of  aspartate \naminotransferase (โASTโ), an enzyme in the blood, with the usual amount of AST in a healthy \npersonโs blood and the prisonerโs platelet count.  \n9 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 25\n36. When this lawsuit was filed, CDOCโs November 2016 protocol specified that \nprisoners with an APRI score below 0.7 are not eligible for treatment and will not be considered \nfor treatment.  The Revised Standards continue to bar prisoners with APRI scores below 0.7 \nfrom receiving treatment.  They will, however, be offered yearly APRI score screening.    \n37. The  Revised  Standards  specify  that  in  order  to  be  considered  for  treatment, \nprisoners must have an APRI score of at least 0.7.  An APRI score of 0.7 is roughly equivalent to \na fibrosis score of F2.  A lower APRI score, however, does not necessarily indicate an absence of \nsignificant fibrosis.   \n38. Even an APRI score of 0.7 or greater, which is evidence of significant fibrotic \nliver  changes,  only  makes  a  prisoner  eligible  for  referral  to  the  CDOC  Infectious  Disease \nCommittee (โCommitteeโ) for โconsiderationโ for treatment.  \n39. Under the prior version of the Standards, prisoners with any level of an APRI \nscore of 0.7 or higher were first required to complete a program of alcohol and drug treatment \nprovided by CDOC, even if the required program was not available in the facility where the \nprisoner was housed.  \n40. There was no medical justification for CDOCโs requirement of substance abuse \ntreatment as a prerequisite to HCV treatment. The requirement unjustifiably delayed a prisonerโs \nability to be even considered for treatment under CDOCโs Standards. \n41. Additionally,  to  be  โconsideredโ  for  DAA  medication  treatment,  the  prior \nStandards required that a prisoner must demonstrate what CDOC regarded as โan absence of \nhigh-risk behaviorโ during the pendency of the alcohol and drug treatment.  This standardless \nrequirement had no medical justification.  CDOC regards any disciplinary offense involving \n10 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 25\nalcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs, tattooing, or sexual activity as evidence of โhigh risk \nbehaviorโ that disqualifies the prisoner for treatment until alcohol and drug classes are repeated \nand a minimum of one year has passed since the last โoffense.โ  In such a case, a prisoner with \nan APRI score of 0.7 could wait as long as three and a half years before he would even be \nconsidered for medical treatment. \n2.  The prisoner selection process. \n42. According to the Standards, the Committee is now expected to meet monthly โ \npreviously its meetings were quarterly โ to assess whether a prisoner would be provided with \nmedication to treat his HCV infection.  If a prisoner is not selected for treatment โbut remains \neligible for treatment,โ the prisonerโs application packet is returned to the application โpoolโ and \nis considered for a future meeting.  There is no guarantee that a prisoner who is โeligibleโ for \ntreatment or โconsideredโ for treatment will actually receive DAA medications.  Under CDOCโs \npolicies,  a  prisoner  with  chronic  HCV  can  comply  with  each  and  every  precondition  for \ntreatment yet still be denied access to DAA medications, with no medical justification for the \ndenial.    \n43. No matter how many prisoners need treatment according to medical standards, \nand no matter how many prisoners are โeligibleโ for treatment under CDOCโs unjustifiably \nrestrictive Revised Standards, CDOC further limits treatment by relying on an artificial quota.  \nOn information and belief, prior to the filing of this case, that quota was 30 prisoners per year.     \n3.  Treatment in practice. \n44. HCV was a contributing factor in six prisoner deaths department wide in CDOCโs \nfiscal year 2013-14. The disease contributed to five deaths in fiscal year 2014-15. In fiscal year \n11 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 25\n2015-16, HCV contributed to seven deaths department wide.  On information and belief, another \nprisoner died of complications of the disease even after the filing of this civil action. \n45. Despite these deaths, CDOC deliberately chooses to limit the number of prisoners \nto whom it provides the curative and life-saving DAA treatments for HCV.  No matter how \nmany  prisoners  manage  to  qualify  as  โeligibleโ  for  treatment  under  CDOCโs  unjustifiably \nrestrictive Revised Standards, CDOC chooses to supply only a limited amount of DAAs to an \nextremely limited number of prisoners.  As a result, CDOC is deliberately choosing to allow \nadditional CDOC prisoners to die from untreated HCV.   \n46. Last  year,  in  an  email  to  then-Senator  Pat  Steadman,  now-retired  Dr.  Tiona \nexplained  that  CDOC  planned  to  โcontinue  to  identify  and  prioritize  [only]  the  sickest \nindividuals for treatment each quarter.โ That plan, Dr. Tiona stated, โshould be effective in \neliminating Department-wide deaths from hepatitis C within the next decade, and โฆ should be \neffective  in  eliminating  all  additional  complications  from  hepatitis  C  by  2035.โ  (emphasis \nadded).    \n47. There is no medical justification for CDOCโs decision to withhold a life-saving \ncure from the thousands of prisoners living with chronic HCV.   \n48. Using CDOCโs overly restrictive criterion of an APRI score greater than 0.7, Dr. \nTiona  estimated  that  735  prisoners  โare  candidates  for  treatment  to  cure  their  Hepatitis  C \ninfection.โ  If CDOC continues to treat only 30 prisoners each year, treatment of this group will \ntake more than 24 years.  Meanwhile, CDOCโs Revised Standards deny treatment altogether for \nmore than 1,500 prisoners whose APRI score does not reach CDOCโs arbitrarily-set minimum.   \n12 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 25\n49. CDOC has announced plans, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, to begin DAA therapy \nfor  as  many  as  70  prisoners.    Despite  this  incremental  improvement,  Defendants  remain \ndeliberately indifferent to prisonersโ serious medical needs.  Treating 70 prisoners per year \nmeans that CDOC will take more than 10 years to treat the 735 prisoners whose APRI scores \ntoday already indicate advancing fibrosis, without accounting for new prisoners with HCV who \nenter the CDOC system, or current prisoners whose advancing APRI scores during that 10 years \nmove them into the greater-than-0.7 group.  Dr. Tiona acknowledged that waiting that long to \ncomplete treatment for this group of prisoners risks โpermanent damage to the liver which could \nresult in life-long complications, even after cure.โ1  Moreover, CDOCโs plan continues to deny \ntreatment to the more than 1,500 prisoners whose APRI score does not rise to the level of 0.7. \n50. Defendants refuse to meet the community standard of care, which requires that \nthey provide treatment to all those prisoners with chronic HCV infections, including Plaintiffs.  \nDefendantsโ public assertions that the Departmentโs policies and practices are consistent with the \nAASLDโs guidelines are false, in that the Departmentโs policies and practices fail to ensure that \nall prisoners with chronic HCV infection who are medically appropriate for DAA treatment are \ngiven these life-saving medications.  Rather, Defendants have deliberately adopted a budget that \nfails to provide DAAs to the overwhelming majority of prisoners who need them.  To facilitate \nthis budgetary choice, Defendants have promulgated, implemented, and enforced policies and \npractices  that are deliberately designed, unjustifiably, to delay and deny  necessary medical \ntreatment to all but a small fraction of the prisoners with chronic HCV infections.  In doing so, \n1Letter dated January 31, 2017, โTo Whom It May Concern,โ from Susan M.

Allegations Regarding Named Plaintiffs.\n1.  Plaintiff Ruben Aragon. \n51. Plaintiff Ruben Aragon is 58 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in 1998.  \nMr.  Aragon  entered  CDOC  in  2011  and  is  serving  a  70-year  sentence.    He  is  currently \nincarcerated at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility. \n52. CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Aragon requested treatment for his chronic \nHCV. \n53. Mr. Aragon has been told that his blood tests demonstrate that his APRI score is \nsufficiently high to be considered for treatment by the Committee.   \n54. Mr. Aragon had previously completed a six-month Substance Abuse Education \nProgram while in CDOC.  Nonetheless, he has been told he will not be considered for treatment \nunless he also completes the Therapeutic Community program.   \n55. The  Arkansas  Valley  Correctional  Facility,  where  Mr.  Aragon  is  currently \nhoused, does not offer the Therapeutic Community program.  \n56. Mr. Aragon challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Aragon has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n14 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 25\n2.  Plaintiff John Spring.\n57. Plaintiff John Spring is 61 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in 2004.  Mr. \nSpring entered CDOC in 1979 and is serving a life sentence.  He is currently incarcerated at the \nSterling Correctional Facility (โSCFโ). \n58. CDOC has  repeatedly  denied Mr. Spring requested treatment for his  chronic \nHCV. \n59. CDOCโs restrictive policies have taken Mr. Spring on a bureaucratic roller coaster \nride.  CDOC medical staff told Mr. Spring that he was eligible to be โconsideredโ for treatment, \nthen not eligible, then again was eligible, then ineligible, then eligible once again. \n60. On June 29, 2015, Nurse Practitioner Helene Christner counseled Mr. Spring \nregarding his HCV and informed him that he met all criteria for treatment.  She completed \nCDOCโs Hepatitis C Evaluation Worksheet and specifically indicated that he qualified due to his \nAPRI score and his completion of alcohol and drug classes. \n61. Nevertheless, on December 7, 2015, Nurse Practitioner Christner told Mr. Spring \nthat he probably would not be approved for Hepatitis C treatment.  She indicated that according \nto his blood tests, he had not sustained sufficient damage to his liver to require treatment.  In Mr. \nSpringโs medical records, she wrote โthat with his AP[R]I score below 1.0 he does not meet the \nDOC criteria for treatment . . . .โ   \n62. The nurse practitionerโs notation in Mr. Springโs  medical records  reflected a \nmisunderstanding of CDOCโs written policy.  At the time, the protocol said that a prisoner would \nbe โconsideredโ for treatment if the APRI score was higher than 0.7.   \n15 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 25\n63. Although  Mr.  Springโs  2015  records  indicate  that  he  had  already  satisfied \nCDOCโs requirement of completing alcohol and drug classes before receiving treatment, the \nCommittee apparently disagreed.  In February, 2016, the Committee determined that Mr. Spring \nwould not receive treatment for his HCV until he first completed a CDOC drug and alcohol \nprogram โand any recommended treatment.โ   \n64. To satisfy the Committee, Mr. Spring completed yet another drug and alcohol \nclass.  \n65. After Mr. Spring completed the class, Nurse Practitioner Christner told him that \nhis โlevelsโ had dropped and that he no longer qualified for treatment for HCV. \n66. Several months later, Nurse Practitioner Christner informed Mr. Spring that he \nonce again qualified for HCV treatment. \n67. Mr. Spring still has not received treatment for his chronic HCV, which causes him \nfatigue. \n68. Mr. Spring challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process. The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Spring has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n3.  Plaintiff Robert Wieghard.\n69. Plaintiff Robert Wieghard is 61 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV in the \nmid-1990s.  Mr. Wieghard entered CDOC in 1982 and is serving a life sentence.  He is currently \nincarcerated at the Bent County Correctional Facility. \n70. CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Wieghard requested treatment for his chronic \nHCV. \n16 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 25\n71. Mr. Wieghardโs APRI score is sufficiently high that he could be โconsideredโ for \ntreatment under CDOCโs overly-restrictive policies.  Nevertheless, CDOC has refused to provide \ntreatment  because  he  has  not  completed  classes  on  alcohol  and  substance  abuse  that  the \nCommittee regards as satisfactory. \n72. Mr.  Wieghard  has  completed  CDOCโs  Addiction  Rehabilitation  Program \n(โARPโ).  Nevertheless, in a December, 2015 letter to Mr. Wieghard, a CDOC Infection Control \nNurse stated that ARP is โno longer considered an acceptable treatment method.โ  The letter \nstated  that  before  Mr.  Wieghard  may  receive  treatment  for  his  HCV,  he  must  complete  a \nTherapeutic Community program.    \n73. At the time that Mr. Wieghard received that letter, he was housed at the Arkansas \nValley Correctional Facility, which did not offer a Therapeutic Community program. \n74. In May, 2016, Mr. Wieghard was transferred to the Buena Vista Correctional \nFacility so that he could participate in the Therapeutic Community program there.   \n75. Because of a physical disability, however, Mr. Wieghard was unable to negotiate \nthe stairs at Buena Vista Correctional Facility.  As a result, Mr. Wieghard was then transferred to \nthe Bent County Correctional Facility. \n76. The  Therapeutic  Community  program  is  not  offered  at  the  Bent  County \nCorrectional Facility, where Mr. Wieghard remains housed today.  \n77. Thus, without medical justification, CDOC refuses to provide treatment to Mr. \nWieghard unless he completes a Therapeutic Community program.  Yet CDOC houses Mr. \nWieghard in a facility that does not offer that program.   \n17 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 25\n78. Mr. Wieghard challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Wieghard has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n4.  Plaintiff David Poole. \n79. Plaintiff David Poole is 52 years old.  He was diagnosed with HCV more than \ntwenty years ago.  Mr. Poole entered CDOC in 2012 and is currently serving a seven-year \nsentence.  He is currently incarcerated at SCF. \n80. CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Poole requested treatment for his chronic HCV. \n81. In 2012 and 2013, Mr. Poole requested treatment for his Hepatitis C while he was \nhoused at CDOCโs Four Mile Correctional Center in Caรฑon City, Colorado.  Treatment was \nrefused.  Officials there told him his โlevelsโ were not high enough, but they did not say what \nthose levels were. \n82. Defendants have continued to deny Mr. Pooleโs requests for treatment at SCF, \nwhere he has been housed since August, 2016. \n83. In October, 2016, SCF medical staff incorrectly calculated Mr. Pooleโs APRI \nscore.  Because of the error, Mr. Poole was regarded, erroneously, as having an APRI score \nbelow 0.7, the threshold that CDOCโs restrictive policies regard as the minimum for treatment to \nbe โconsidered.โ  Nurse Practitioner Christner told Mr. Poole that his โlevelsโ were not high \nenough to warrant treatment. \n84. Mr. Pooleโs APRI score, calculated correctly, indicates that he is far above the \nminimum that CDOC requires for a prisoner to be โconsideredโ for treatment. \n18 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 25\n85. Mr. Pooleโs health has been steadily declining.  He attributes the decline in his \nhealth to his untreated chronic HCV infection.  He has experienced bloating in his abdomen that \nhe attributes to his worsening condition from HCV.  He has also developed a rash that has \ncontinued to spread.  His entire body itches constantly.  When he scratches his skin, he develops \nopen sores, and he is concerned about the risk of spreading his HCV infection as a result.   \n86. Mr. Poole challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.  The CDOC denied his grievance at all three stages of the process.  \nAccordingly, Mr. Poole has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n5.  Plaintiff James Bratt. \n87. Plaintiff James Bratt is 42 years old.  He discovered that he had HCV in 2010 or \n2011.  He believes that he contracted HCV while in CT Correctional Facility in 2009.  Mr. Bratt \nentered CDOC again in 2013 and is serving a 27-year sentence.  He is currently incarcerated at \nthe Buena Vista Correctional Facility. \n88. CDOC has repeatedly denied Mr. Brattโs requested treatment for his chronic \nHCV. \n89. Mr. Bratt has completed drug and alcohol treatment programs by successfully \ncompleting the Therapeutic Communities program in 2015.  After completion, he stayed in the \nprogram as a para-teacher leading some of the classes. \n90. Mr. Bratt challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOC grievance process.

He was diagnosed with HCV in 1986.  \nMr. Kaneta entered CDOC in 1981 and is serving a sentence of 20 years to life.  He is currently \nincarcerated at the SCF. \n20 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 25\n99. CDOC has denied Mr. Kaneta requests for treatment for his chronic HCV.\n100. Mr. Kaneta challenged the lack of treatment for his chronic HCV through the \nCDOCโs  grievance  process.   The  CDOC  denied  his  grievance  at  all  three  stages  of  the \nprocess.  Accordingly, Mr. Kaneta has exhausted all available administrative remedies. \nV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n101.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on behalf of themselves, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP., 23(a) and 23(b)(2), a class of: \nAll current and future prisoners in the custody of CDOC who have been or will be \ndiagnosed  with  chronic  Hepatitis  C,  who  have  at  least  24  weeks  or  more \nremaining on their sentences and a life expectancy of more than one year, with the \nexception  of  prisoners  who  are  already  receiving  or  have  already  completed \ntreatment with DAA medications. \n102.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy the wrongdoing of \nDefendants for themselves and for all members of the putative class. \n103.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are satisfied by this action. \n104.  As of November, 2016, CDOC reports that 2,280 prisoners had been diagnosed \nwith HCV.  Because not all current prisoners have been tested, CDOCโs number is undoubtedly \nlow.  The overwhelming majority of these 2,280 prisoners have chronic HCV.  In addition, the \nclass includes future prisoners with chronic Hepatitis C.  Accordingly, members of the class are \nso numerous as to make joinder impracticable. \n105.  There are questions of law and fact common to the entire class because the actions \nof Defendants complained of herein are applicable to the entire class.  These common questions \ninclude, but are not limited to: \na. Whether chronic infection with HCV represents a serious medical need;\n21 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 25\nb. Whether the community standard of care requires treatment with DAAs \nfor all persons diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C, except persons with a \nlife expectancy of less than one year; \nc. Whether Defendants have knowingly employed policies and practices that \nunjustifiably delay or deny treatment for chronic HCV; \nd. Whether Defendantsโ failure to provide treatment to Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the class in accordance with the prevailing standard of care \nhas put Plaintiffs and members of the class at risk of serious harm; \ne. Whether Defendants are deliberately indifferent to class membersโ serious \nmedical needs; \nf. Whether Defendantsโ policies and practices with regard to HCV treatment \nviolates class membersโ rights under the Eighth Amendment. \n106.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the members of the class because Plaintiffs and \nother members of the class were injured by the same wrongful treatment policies, protocols, and \npractices of Defendants as set forth herein.  Plaintiffsโ claims arise from the same course of \nconduct that give rise to the claims of the members of the class and are based on the same legal \ntheories. \n107.  Plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n108.  The relief requested herein as applied to all members of the class would be \nproper.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so \nthat final injunctive or declaratory relief with regard the class as a whole would be appropriate.  \nCertification of the class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) is therefore proper.\n22 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 25\nVI.CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nVIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION \n109.  Plaintiffs  re-allege and  incorporate the allegations  above as  if fully set forth \nherein. \n110.  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees all citizens, \nincluding Plaintiffs and members of the class, the right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment. \n111.  By the policies and practices set forth herein, Defendants subject Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the class to a substantial risk of serious harm and untimely death from inadequate \nmedical care.  Defendants have been and are aware of all the deprivations complained of herein, \nhave adopted policies and practices that institutionalize those deprivations, and have been and \nare deliberately indifferent to the deprivations.  Defendantsโ acts and omissions in failing to \nprovide adequate medical care constitute deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of \nprisoners infected with HCV, in violation of Plaintiffsโ and members of the classโs rights under \nthe Eighth Amendment. \n112.  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to a declaration that \nDefendantsโ written and unwritten policies, customs, and practices exhibit deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffsโ serious medical needs.  Plaintiffs and the class are also entitled to an injunction \nrequiring Defendants to adopt policies and practices that adequately provide for the serious \nmedical needs of prisoners with chronic HCV. \n23 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 25\n113.  Plaintiffs and members of the class have suffered and will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendantsโ wrongful policies and practices, unless granted the \nrelief that they request. \nVII.PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \ng. Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2);\nh. Declare that the policies and practices of Defendants, as set forth herein,\nare in violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class under the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\ni. Enjoin  Defendants,  their  agents,  employees,  officials,  and  all  persons\nacting in concert with them, from subjecting Plaintiffs and members of the\nclass to the unconstitutional policies and practices described herein;\nj. Order Defendants to develop and implement, as soon as is practicable and\nin no even later than three months of the date of such order, a plan to\neliminate the substantial risk of serious harm that Plaintiffs and members\nof  the  class  suffer  due  to  the  unconstitutional  policies  and  practices\ndescribed  herein.  Defendantsโ  plan  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  a\nhepatitis-C treatment policy that comports with the community standard of\ncare and the advice of medical experts and that ensures the Plaintiffs and\nmembers of the Class are treated with appropriate direct-acting antiviral\ndrugs;\n24 \nACTIVE\\50822207.v6-9/9/17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01744-RBJ   Document 25   Filed 09/11/17   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 25\nk.
