    "summary": "<p>On June 12, 2014, six individuals formerly held in the Floyd County Jail filed a class-action complaint in the Southern District of Indiana, against Floyd County, Indiana, the Sheriff in his official and unofficial capacities, corrections officers of Floyd County Jail, and other sheriff department workers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought actual and punitive damages for themselves and the other members of their class, declaratory judgment stating all policies enforcing humiliating and torturous practices were unconstitutional, and an injunction prohibiting the defendants from practicing or enforcing those policies. The plaintiffs claimed their Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment Rights were violated. Specifically, they claimed that during detention in Floyd County Jail, through use of excessive force, they were stripped of their clothing and kept in a state of undress in a padded cell in violation of their constitutional rights. </p><p>In the complaint, the plaintiffs claimed they were stripped of their clothing without probable cause or provocation. They claimed this action was done in front of members of the opposite sex, in view of jail employees, and on surveillance tapes containing images of the plaintiffs' naked bodies. The plaintiffs were kept in a padded room without access to a phone or bathroom and left in the state of undress until given a smock. The plaintiffs additionally claimed the defendants used excessive and unnecessary force through pepper spray or taser absent provocation or probable cause. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were using the same policies and practices implemented against them on other detained individuals. The plaintiffs alleged these abuses were a result of policies and practices implemented by the jail. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint on November 12, 2014, to include three more representatives. One of the new plaintiffs moved to sever their claim, which Chief Judge Richard Young granted on February 17, 2016.</p><p>On June 15, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which Judge Young granted on February 16, 2016. The final approved designated class was: “All inmates confined from June 12, 2012, to present in the Floyd County Jail who were not on a suicide watch, but were housed in a padded cell where they were deprived of clothing, bedding, and hygiene products.” The court also approved a subclass of “[t]hose class members who were subjected to weapons deployment while confined and secured in the padded cells.” 313 F.R.D. 72. </p><p>On March 1, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the class certification arguing that the main class did not meet the requirements for commonality and predominance. Additionally, the defendants argued the subclass did not contain enough members. On July 25, 2016, Chief Judge Young granted the defendants' motion in part and denied in part. He found that the court did not err with respect to the main class but the subclass did not include enough members. 2016 WL 4088748. The plaintiffs appealed the redetermination of the subclass on July 29, 2016, arguing there would be enough members. The motion was denied on October 27, 2016, because Chief Judge Young found the subclass definition involved an officer’s choice to use force and therefore could not be used for class certification. </p><p>The defendants appealed to the Seventh Circuit the plaintiffs' main class certification and moved for a stay pending their appeal. On August 24, 2016 the appeal to the Seventh Circuit was denied. The motion for stay was denied two days later.  </p><p>On February 6, 2017, the parties moved jointly to approve settlement. Magistrate Judge Baker approved the settlement on August 2, 2017. The settlement detailed the creation of a settlement fund for $1,230,000. Attorney fees amounted to 37% of the settlement fund, and each plaintiff was paid an additional $15,000 for their time as class representative in the litigation. The rest of the settlement fund was to be distributed to the class. Each member who was subjected to the deployment of taser or pepper spray with a valid claim were to receive an additional $3,000. Any remaining funds were to be redistributed evenly among class members with each member not getting more than $25,000. Any remaining funds were to be returned to the defendants. </p><p>The settlement fund was agreed to be explicitly for damages resulting from alleged personal injuries and not as a form of punitive damages. The settlement also detailed the policy advising the treatment of individuals in this manner was to be suspended. Additionally, Field Training Officers were to be independently certified, and new employees were to go through orientation and receive training on how to handle new inmates. Finally, the facility supervisor, security supervisor, and classification officer needed to attend Inmate Behavior Management and Training conducted by the National Institute of Corrections.  </p><p>The court approved the parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement on August 2, 2017. The case is now closed.</p>",

For \nthe reasons set forth below, the court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part \nDefendants’ motion. \nI.  Background \n  In this action, Plaintiffs challenge the Floyd County Sheriff’s Department policy \nentitled “Combative Subjects Practices.”   (Filing No. 49-3, Combative Subjects Policy).  \n1 \n \n\nAs its name suggests, the Policy covers the best practices for Floyd County Jail Personnel \nto deal with “combative and potentially suicidal subjects” entering the Jail.  (Id.).  The \nPolicy leaves the determination of who falls within the Policy to the discretion of Jail \nPersonnel, and grants them the authority to take unruly detainees to a padded cell, strip \nthem of their clothes, and clothe them in a “protective smock.”  (Id.).  In determining \nwhether a subject is unruly, the Policy instructs staff to use a “temperature test”: \nSupervisors  or  medical  staff that  deem  a  subject  unstable  by  means  of \nintoxications [sic], general threating [sic] behavior, have the ability to take \neach incident and conduct a “temperature” test to decided [sic] what the best \ncourse of action is to protect all parties.  This “temperature” test to decided \n[sic]  what  the  best  course  of  action  is  to  protect  all  parties.    This \n“temperature”  test  includes  the  subject’s  demeanor,  attitude,  actions, \nintoxication, and a number of other officer observations that would allow \nhim to make this determination. \n(Id.).   \n  Subjects who fail the temperature test are placed into one of two padded isolation \ncells, referred to as “PD-1” and “PD-2.”  (Filing No. 44-1, Deposition of Lt. Andrew \nSands at 90-92).  These cells consist of four walls; there is no bench on which to sit.  (See \nFiling No. 52, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 5 (videotape of Plaintiffs in one of the cells)).  Once inside a \npadded cell, detainees are stripped of their clothing and given a one-size-fits-all \nprotective (i.e., suicide prevention) smock.  In addition, they are deprived of mattresses, \nblankets, and personal hygiene products because, according to Lt. Andrew Sands, such \nitems can be used as weapons.  (Sands Dep. at 125-29; see also id. at 230 (“Q: So \nanytime someone refuses orders, you view them as a threat to use their clothing as a \nweapon against officers?  A:  Among other reasons, yes.”); id. at 127 (“Q: Are the \n2 \n \n\ninmates that are being held naked in padded cells except for a smock provided with a \nblanket?  A:  No, they are not.”); id. at 128 (“Q: Are the inmates that are being held in the \npadded cells naked except for a smock provided with a hygiene pack?  A: They are \nnot.”)).  Detainees remain in the padded cell until Jail Personnel determine, in their \njudgment, the detainees will behave.  (Id. at 103-04 (testifying that “if an inmate was a \nbehavioral problem, we may tell them, “‘Okay.  Let’s reevaluate this in a couple hours \n[until] you can prove to us that you’re going to follow our rules and be respectful . . . \n.’”)). \n  The Plaintiffs herein were placed in the padded cell because they failed the \ntemperature test by engaging in bad behavior with Jail Personnel during the booking \nprocess.  (See, e.g., Filing No. 17, Am. Compl. ¶ 49).  In addition to being stripped of \ntheir clothing, Plaintiffs allege they were treated without dignity or respect.  Some had to \nurinate in a floor drain (Id. ¶¶ 62, 75, 84, 106, 122, 136); some were denied their \nmedications (id. ¶¶ 110, 132); some were pepper sprayed (id. ¶¶ 56, 115); and some were \nhit with a taser (id. ¶¶ 72, 101).  Plaintiffs allege the Jail’s Policy and/or unwritten \npractice of “stripping out”1 unruly subjects violates the Fourth Amendment’s right to \nprivacy and prohibition against excessive force; the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition \nagainst cruel and unusual punishment; and the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to \nsubstantive and procedural due process.   \n                                              \n1 Sgt. Ryan Rainey testified that the term “stripping out” is “just a short form of saying they went \nto a padded cell.”  (Filing No. 46, Deposition of Ryan Rainey at 26).  \n3 \n \n\n  After considering the facts, issues, and the applicable law, the court granted \nPlaintiffs’ request to certify the following class for liability issues only pursuant to Rule \n23(c)(4): \nAll inmates confined from June 12, 2013 to present in the Floyd County Jail \nwho were not on a suicide watch, but were housed in a padded cell where \nthey were deprived of clothing, bedding, and hygiene products. \n \nIn addition, the court granted Plaintiff’s request to certify the following subclass: \nThose class members who were subjected to weapons deployment while \nconfined and secured in the padded cells. \n \n  Defendants’ motion to reconsider followed. \nII.  Discussion \n  The court has the inherent power to reconsider interlocutory orders and reopen any \npart of a case before entry of final judgment.  Fisher v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 152 \nF.R.D. 145, 149 (S.D. Ind. 1993).  “Motions for reconsideration serve a limited function: \nto correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.”  Caisse \nNationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI Indus., Inc., 90 F.3d 1264, 1269 (7th Cir. 1996) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  A motion to reconsider is appropriate \nwhen “‘the Court has patently misunderstood a party, or has made a decision outside of \nthe adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties, or has made an error not of \nreasoning but of apprehension.’”  Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc., 906 \nF.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. 1990) (quoting Above the Belt, Inc. v. Mel Bohannan Roofing, \nInc., 99 F.R.D. 99, 101 (E.D. Va. 1983)).  Whether to grant a motion to reconsider is \n4 \n \n\ncommitted to the sound discretion of the district court.  Caisse Nationale, 90 F.3d at \n1270. \nDefendants raise a number of arguments in support of reconsideration.  The court \nwill begin with whether the class is identifiable. \nA.  Identifiable Class \n  The definition of the main class requires a class member to be: (1) not on suicide \nwatch; (2) housed in a padded cell; (3) deprived of bedding; (4) deprived of clothing; and \n(5) deprived of hygiene products.  According to Defendants, class members cannot be \ndetermined based simply on their presence in the padded cell because potential factual \ndisputes exist regarding the last two class requirements—that class members be deprived \nof clothing and deprived of hygiene products.  Therefore, Defendants argue, the court \nerred in finding the main class identifiable.   \n  Citing the testimony of Lt. Sands, the court found that those unruly inmates who \nwere stripped of their clothing and provided a jail-issued smock were never given \nbedding and hygiene products as a matter of course.  Defendants admit this fact in their \nResponse to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  (Filing No. 66, Defendants’ \nResponse at 34 (“Blankets, mattresses and hygiene items are not provided to inmates who \nhave been so combative or resistant with the staff that they are placed in the padded cell \nbecause it would give the inmate something to use on the officers or themselves.”)).  \nDefendants assert, however, that inmates were not deprived of hygiene products because, \nas Lt. Sands testified, if an inmate needed a hygiene item to shower or brush his or her \n5 \n \n\nteeth, Jail Personnel would provide the hygiene item and require it be returned after use.  \n(Sands Dep. at 129). \n  The withdrawal of hygiene products as a disciplinary measure can constitute a \nconstitutional violation.  See, e.g., Gillis v. Litscher, 468 F.3d 488, 493 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(confinement without adequate access to life’s necessities, including hygiene items, can \nviolate the Eighth Amendment).  Here, inmates subject to the Jail’s stripping out policy \nwere not issued hygiene items in the isolation cell.  Whether an inmate later received \nhygiene items is not at issue and goes only to damages, not liability.  See Pella Corp. v \nSaltzman, 606 F.3d 391, 394 (7th Cir. 2010) (a district court may “certif[y] a class for \nliability alone where damages or causation may require individualized assessments”).   \n  Defendants also identify a factual issue over whether the smock is the functional \nequivalent of “clothing.”  The key issue of fact—i.e., that class members were forcibly \nstripped—is undisputed.  Just as with hygiene products, that some members suffered the \nindignity of having their naked bodies exposed for a short period of time goes to the issue \nof damages, not liability.  Accordingly, the court finds it did not err in finding the class \nsufficiently identifiable. \n  B.  The Main Class \n  Next, Defendants argue that the court erred in finding the Plaintiffs satisfied the \ncommonality and predominance requirements of Rule 23(a)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) \nrespectively.   \n \n \n6 \n \n\n    1.  Commonality \nTo meet the commonality requirement, there must be “questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “A common nucleus of operative fact is \nusually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).”  Keele v. \nWexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) (quoting Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, \n1018 (7th Cir. 1992)).  A common nucleus of operative fact exists where “defendants \nhave engaged in standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class.”  Id.  In \nWal-Mart v. Dukes, the Supreme Court explained: \n[The  plaintiffs’]  claims  must  depend  upon  a  common  contention  –  for \nexample,  the  assertion  of  discriminatory  bias  on  the  part  of  the  same \nsupervisor.  That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature \nthat it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination \nof its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \nof the claims in one stroke. \n \n564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). \n  In Flood v. Dominguez, 270 F.R.D. 413 (N.D. Ind. 2010), the district court \ncertified a class of detainees housed in holding cells for more than 24 hours without a bed \nor mattress.  The commonality requirement was satisfied, the Flood court reasoned, \nbecause “Plaintiffs’ core complaint—that the Jail’s policy of keeping detainees in holding \ncells for over 24 hours without a mattress or bed is unconstitutional—is common to the \nentire class.”  Id. at 418.  In the present case, the court analogized Plaintiffs’ proposed \nclass to the class certified in Flood, and concluded: \nPlaintiffs do not challenge the reasons for their placement in a padded cell.  \nRather, they challenge the conditions of their confinement in the padded \ncell—no  clothing  (but  a  smock),  no  bedding  or  hygiene  products—as \npunitive and out of balance with any legitimate penological interest.  This \n7 \n \n\ninquiry  does  not  depend  on  any  individualized  determination.    In  sum, \nPlaintiffs’ core complaint—whether Defendants’ “stripped out” policy or \npractice is unconstitutionally punitive—is common to the entire class.   \n \n(Filing No. 75, Entry on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification at 11-12) (internal \ncitations omitted). \n  Defendants assert that certification is inappropriate because, unlike the inmates in \nFlood, not every inmate in the Jail is subjected to the stripped out policy.  Defendants are \ncorrect; not every inmate is subjected to the stripped out policy and placed in isolation.  \nBut that fact does not preclude certification, because those that are subject to the policy \nsuffer the same consequences—detainment in an isolation cell with no clothing (but a \nsmock), no bedding, and no hygiene products.  See, e.g., Gillis, 468 F.3d at 493 (“A lack \nof heat, clothing, or sanitation can violate the Eighth Amendment.”); Maxwell v. Mason, \n668 F.2d 361, 365 (8th Cir. 1981) (confinement in isolation without adequate clothing or \nbedding supports an Eighth Amendment claim: “clothing is a ‘basic necessity of human \nexistence’”); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537 (1979) (“[P]unitive measures . . . may not \nconstitutionally be imposed prior to a determination of guilt.”).  The conditions of \nconfinement in the isolation cell, therefore, apply equally to the entire class.  See Flood v. \nDominguez, No. 2:08-cv-153 PPS PRC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6754, at *9 (N.D. Ind. \nJan. 21, 2011) (explaining on reconsideration that certification was appropriate because \nthe “alleged conditions common to all detainees—the lack of bedding, cold temperatures, \nlack of hygiene items, lack of exercise, small meal portions—were the result of the Jail’s \nuniform policies and practices and were applied to all detainees at the Jail”); Dunn v. City \nof Chicago, 231 F.R.D. 367, 377 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (finding courts “routinely address \n8 \n \n\nconditions of confinement claims in class actions” where the conditions of confinement \n“common to all . . . are unlawful”).   \n    2.  Predominance \n  Under the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), common questions of law \nor fact must predominate; in other words, “there must be a common nucleus of operative \nfacts applicable to the entire class.”  Ziemack v. Centel Corp., 163 F.R.D. 530, 535-36 \n(N.D. Ill. 1995).  Defendants argue the issues in this case are too individualized and fact-\nsensitive to allow class certification, particularly where, as here, multiple Defendants are \nsued in their individual and official capacities.   \n  The certification issue here focuses on Plaintiffs’ Monell claim that Floyd \nCounty’s “stripping out” policy and unwritten practice is unconstitutional, and not on any \nindividual capacity claims.  “When a class challenges a uniform policy or practice, the \nvalidity of that policy or practice tends to be the predominant issue in the ensuing \nlitigation.”  Young v. County of Cook, No. 06 C 552, 2007 WL 1238920, at *7 (N.D. Ill. \nApr. 25, 2007).  This is especially true where, as here, the conditions stem from jail \npolicies or practices that are uniformly applied to all inmates.  Flood, 270 F.R.D. at 420.  \nAccordingly, the court finds it did not err in concluding Plaintiffs satisfied the \ncommonality and predominance requirements of Rule 23.  Having so found, the court \nreiterates its stance that a class action is superior to prosecuting individual claims.  \nDefendants’ motion to reconsider certification of the main class is therefore DENIED. \n \n \n9 \n \n\n  C.  The Subclass \n  Defendants also argue that certification of the subclass was erroneous because the \nPlaintiffs have only identified 20 potential subclass members.   \n  To meet the numerosity requirement, the class must be so large “that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  Keele, 149 F.3d at 594.  Although there is not a numerical \nthreshold to establish numerosity, 40 is generally considered sufficiently large to satisfy \nRule 23(a).  See Swanson v. Am. Consumer Indus., Inc., 415 F.2d 1326, 1333 & n.9 (7th \nCir. 1969) (even 40 class members “is a sufficiently large group to satisfy Rule 23(a)”).  \nWhen determining whether joinder is impracticable, the court may also consider other \nfactors including, inter alia, judicial economy arising from the avoidance of a multiplicity \nof lawsuits, the financial resources of the class members, the inconvenience of trying \nindividual suits, the size of each plaintiff’s claim, and factors relevant to the practicability \nof joining all class members.  Donovan v. St. Joseph Co. Sheriff, No. 3:11-cv-133-TLS, \n2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis 63847, at *6-7 (N.D. Ind. May 3, 2012) (citing 32B Am. Jur. 2d \nFederal Courts § 1608; 5 Moore’s Fed. Practice – Civil § 23.22[1][a] (3d ed. 2011)).    \n  At the time the court initially ruled on Plaintiffs’ motion, the court was under the \nimpression that there were over 25 inmates that fit within the subclass.  The court was \nmistaken; Plaintiffs reported then that the potential class was actually estimated to be \n“over 20.”  As of their Response to the present motion, Plaintiffs have not identified any \nadditional potential members.  Twenty or so class members is simply not enough to \nsatisfy the numerosity requirement.  See Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 (2008) \n(“We can assume 14 would not be enough . . . .”); Oplchenski v. Parfums Givenchy, Inc., \n10 \n \n\n254 F.R.D. 489, 495 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (“Generally, where class members number at least \n40, joinder is considered impracticable and numerosity is satisfied.”); Ansari v. N.Y. \nUniv., 179 F.R.D. 112, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (numerosity satisfied when the class \ncomprises 40 or more members and . . . not . . . satisfied when the class comprises 21 or \nfewer”).  Furthermore, the court finds that joinder would not be impracticable, even \nconsidering the additional factors such as the inconvenience of trying individual \nexcessive force cases, given the size of the putative class members.  The court therefore \nreconsiders its prior ruling and GRANTS Defendants’ motion to reconsider certification \nof the subclass.2 \nIII.  Conclusion \n  The court finds it did not err with respect to the certification of the main class, but \ndid err with respect to certification of the subclass.  Therefore, the court GRANTS in \npart and DENIES in part Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration of Court’s Entry on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class (Filing No. 78). \n \nSO ORDERED this 25th day of July 2016.       \n               \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n2 Defendants also argue that the subclass pertains to issues regarding the use of force which \nnecessarily requires consideration of individualized circumstances.  Because the issue of \nnumerosity is dispositive, the court will not address this argument. \n \n11 \n \n\nDistributed Electronically to Registered Counsel of Record \n12 \n ",

Plaintiffs were placed \nin isolation because of their behavior during the booking process pursuant to the \nCombative Subjects Policy which, they allege, gave Jail officers the authority to strip \nthem of their clothing (sometimes forcibly) and replace their clothing with a suicide \nprevention smock.  They were also deprived of a mattress, blanket, or personal hygiene \nitems. \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 111   Filed 10/27/16   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 1513\n  On February 16, 2016, the court granted the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify the \nfollowing class for liability issues only pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4): \nAll inmates confined from June 12, 2013 to present in the Floyd County Jail \nwho were not on a suicide watch, but were housed in a padded cell where \nthey were deprived of clothing, bedding, and hygiene products. \n \nIn addition, the court granted Plaintiffs’ request to certify the following subclass: \nThose class members who were subjected to weapons deployment while \nconfined and secured in the padded cells. \n \n  On July 25, 2016, the court granted Defendants’ motion to reconsider its \ncertification order with respect to the subclass, finding that the Plaintiffs had not satisfied \nthe numerosity requirement.  Plaintiffs now move the court to reconsider its decision.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, their motion is DENIED. \nI.  Discussion \n  Plaintiffs represent that after a thorough review of the voluminous records \nproduced in this case, they grossly understated the size of the subclass, and now represent \nthe subclass consists of 59 individuals.  As support, they filed Exhibit 1, a list of class \nmembers identified in this case.  The members of the subclass are those with an asterisk \nby his or her name.  (See Filing No. 89-1, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1, list of class members with \nasterisks).  Fifty-nine members easily surpasses the 40 or so needed to satisfy the \nnumerosity requirement, they argue, and therefore, the court should reconsider its \nprevious order de-certifying the subclass. \n  Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motion for several reasons, only one of which need \nbe addressed.  They argue that the subclass implicates an officer’s decision to use force, \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 111   Filed 10/27/16   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 1514\nwhich is an inherently fact-sensitive issue and thus, not amenable to class treatment.  \nPlaintiffs respond that the subclass’ claim is not impermissibly fact-dependent.  They \nexplain: “The allegation is that the conditions in the padded cell are constitutionally \ninhumane, and the introduction of weapons into that environment can never be justified.”  \n(Filing No. 102, Plaintiffs’ Reply at 1).  This is because “naked people locked in a cell \nare, as a matter of law, never a threat to jail staff.”  (Id.).  Thus, unlike the main class, the \nsubclass is not based on the conditions of the class members’ confinement; instead, it is \nbased on the use of force against them.  Plaintiffs argue a Jail officer’s decision to use \nforce is “allowed” by the Combative Subjects Policy, which reads in relevant part: \nOur staff is trained to maintain control of a subject by both verbal and \nphysical means if necessary.  If we fail to maintain order and discipline \nwithin the facility then we jeopardize the safety of inmates and staff alike.  \nThe staff are to take all threats of an inmate’s [sic] seriously and react \naccording to the use of force policy and practice.   \n \n(Filing No. 43-2, Combative Subjects Policy).    \n  The definition of the subclass begs the question of why weapons were deployed on \nthose class members in the first place.  The testimony of Sgt. Ryan Rainey and Officer \nMeghan Atherton, cited by Plaintiffs, answers this question.  They both testified that \npepper spray was introduced into the padded cells “to gain compliance.”  (Filing No. 46-\n1, Deposition of Ryan Rainey (“Rainey Dep.”) at 88; Filing No. 43-1, Deposition of \nMeghan Atherton (“Atherton Dep.”) at 56).  Sgt. Rainey explained: \nThe majority of the time – well, the only time I ever used pepper spray was \nto deter them from punching, hitting walls because on numerous occasions \nwhere we had to take someone to the hospital if they break their hand or hurt \ntheir foot.  So we would introduce pepper spray to gain their compliance so \nthey don’t do that. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 111   Filed 10/27/16   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 1515\n \n(Rainey Dep. at 88; see also Atherton Dep. at 55-56 (Q: “For what purpose are they \npepper-sprayed while in that cell naked except for the smock?”  A: “In attempts to gain \ncompliance.  If they’re trying to get other cells, you know, riled up with them, with their \noutburst, trying to gain compliance. . . .  If they’re screaming or kicking and, you know, \nthey won’t stop.”)).   \n  The evidence establishes that Jail officers used pepper spray to subdue unruly \ninmates who posed a danger to themselves, and not, as Plaintiffs’ theorized, for officer \nsafety.  Moreover, the Combative Subjects Policy directs Jail officers to react to the \nmisbehavior of inmates according to the Sheriff’s use of force policy.  The determination \nto use force, then, is left to the discretion of the officers based on their education, \ntraining, and experience.  Stated differently, the decision to use force on an inmate in \nisolation is dependent on the facts presented to an officer at a given time, such as the \ninmate’s behavior, actions, and/or reactions to the attending Jail staff’s requests to, for \nexample, refrain from screaming or kicking the walls.  Such individualized \ndeterminations of liability would not be benefited by class certification.  See Brown v. \nSec’y, Dep’t of Corr., No. 2:03-cv-526-FtM-29DNF, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48442, at \n*26-27 (M.D. Fl. Sept. 20, 2005) (denying class certification because the decision to use \nchemical agents on inmates is dependent on the facts of each individual situation facing a \ncorrectional officer).   \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 111   Filed 10/27/16   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 1516\nII.  Conclusion \n  The subclass implicates an officer’s decision to use force, an inherently fact-\nsensitive inquiry which is not appropriate for class certification.  Therefore, the court \nDENIES Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration of De-Certification of Sub-Class (Filing \nNo. 89). \n \nSO ORDERED this 26th day of October 2016. \n \n    __________________________________\n               \n    RICHARD L.

Plaintiffs Tabitha Gentry, Vincent Minton, Michael Herron, Adam Walker, \nBrian Burgess, Anna Chastain, and Janelle South file this action in their individual capacities \nand  on  behalf  of  all  persons  stripped,  held  naked,  tortured,  humiliated,  and  abused  by \nDefendants as a regular part of Defendants' policies, procedures, and protocol. \n  2.  This class of people includes all individuals who were so treated from June \n12, 2012, to the present. \n  3.  Such treatment has been regularly perpetrated by Defendants and there are \npotentially hundreds of members of this class. \n  4.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  in  this  case  that  are  common  to  all \nmembers of this class. \n  5.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the class, and they will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of this class. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  6.  Plaintiffs, and all other similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages \nfrom  Defendants  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1871,  42  U.S.C.  §1983,  for  gross  and \nunconscionable violations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the \n  3 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 4 of 22 PageID #: 119\nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \nStates. \n  7.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§1331 and §1343. \n  8.   Plaintiffs  and  the  other  members  of  the  class  also  seek  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief. \n  9.  As Floyd County, Indiana is the location of all acts on which Plaintiff's claims \nare based, venue is proper in this Court. \nCLASS ACTION \n  10.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), (2) and \n(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n  11.  The class consists of all individuals who, since June 12, 2012, were forcibly \nstripped of their clothing, and kept in a state of undress for prolonged periods of time, \nwhether as a punitive measure, or as a torture method, or under the pretext of a search and \nseizure, or any other reason. \n  12.  This class also consists of individuals who were subjected to the use of pepper \nspray, taser, or other unnecessary and unwarranted means of excessive force while being held \nunder these conditions. \n  13.  Plaintiffs and other members of the class were subjected to such treatment \ndespite the absence of any reasonable, individualized suspicion or probable cause required by \nlaw. \n  14.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members. \nThey are members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class members. \n  4 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 5 of 22 PageID #: 120\n  15.  Plaintiffs were harmed and offended by the treatment accorded them and will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class. \n  16.  Plaintiffs’  interest  in  obtaining  injunctive  relief  and  actual  and  punitive \ndamages for the violations of their constitutional rights and privileges are consistent with and \nnot antagonistic of those of any other person within the class. \n  17.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non  information  and  belief,  that  Defendants  regularly  forcibly  remove  the  clothing  of \narrestees/detainees, and leave them without clothing for prolonged periods of time, despite \nthe absence of any reasonable, individualized suspicion, probable cause, threat, security \ninterest, or provocation that would justify such an extreme sanction. \n  18.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly expose such detainees’ naked bodies to \nmembers of the opposite sex either through conducting the forcible removal of clothing, \nthrough the subsequent withholding of clothing while in view of Jail employees and inmates, \nor through video surveillance of detainees’ naked bodies. \n  19.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly expose such detainees’ naked bodies to \nharmful and extremely offensive touching. \n  20.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non  information  and  belief,  that  Defendants  regularly  subject  detainees  to  unnecessary, \nunwarranted, and excessive uses of force during and following the removal of their clothing \ndespite the absence of any provocation, legitimate security or law enforcement interest, \nprobable cause, or articulable individualized suspicion. \n  5 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 6 of 22 PageID #: 121\n  21.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly deprive such detainees of access to \nbathroom facilities, and force detainees to void into a floor drain. \n  22.  In addition, upon information and belief, video footage was taken of the above \nabuses. This video footage, which includes clear and graphic depictions of Plaintiffs' naked \nbodies, is available to Floyd County Sheriff employees, other members of Floyd County \ngovernment, and to the general public.1 \n  23.  Such  abuses  violate  the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  42  U.S.C.  §1983,  and  clearly \nestablished law. \n  24.  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  are  entitled  to  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief and an award of compensatory and punitive damages. \n  25.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \na.  A  multiplicity  of  suits  with  consequent  burden  on  the  courts  and \nDefendants should be avoided. \n \nb.  It would be virtually impossible for all class members to intervene as \nparties-plaintiffs in this action. \n \nc.  Upon  adjudication  of  Defendants'  liability,  claims  of  the  class \nmembers can be determined by this Court. \n \n                                                             \n1 Video footage of Plaintiff Tabitha Gentry was obtained through a request pursuant to the Indiana \nAccess to Public Records Act, IC § 5-14-3. \n \n  6 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 122\nNATURE OF DEFENDANTS' CONDUCT  \n  26.  The  conduct  of  the  Defendants  constitutes  torture,  and  violates  clearly \nestablished, longstanding national and international norms. \n  27.  Defendants' treatment of Plaintiffs and other class members is intolerable in a \ncivilized society, and presents a marked departure from the standard to which the Western \nworld adheres for the treatment of prisoners of war during wartime, let alone the standard of \nacceptable treatment for American citizens on American soil. \n  28.  Defendants engaged in the conduct described below under color of the law of \nthe State of Indiana and Floyd County. \n  29.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of Defendants Floyd \nCounty and Darrell Mills to employ qualified persons for positions of authority, to properly \nor conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, \nand/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by \ncustom to protect the constitutional rights of American citizens. \n  30.  Defendants’ conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active  \nmalice toward Plaintiffs and the class, or constitutes a total and reckless disregard for and \nindifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional and common law rights, justifying an award of \npunitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs and the class are entitled \nto recover. \nPARTIES \n  31.

Plaintiff Tabitha Gentry is a thirty-two-year-old mother of four. \n  43.  On  March  30,  2014  at  approximately  4:00  a.m.,  Gentry  was  arrested  on \nsuspicion  of  public  intoxication,  disorderly  conduct,  and  resisting  law  enforcement,  all \nmisdemeanor offenses. \n  44.  Indiana State Police transported Gentry to the Floyd County Jail. \n  45.  Upon arriving at the Floyd County Jail, Gentry was escorted, in handcuffs, to \nthe “remand room.” \n  46.  While  waiting  to  be  booked,  Gentry  had  a  verbal  altercation  with  three \nDefendant officers. \n  47.  During this verbal exchange, Gentry was seated on a bench and her hands \nwere cuffed behind her back. \n  48.  Defendants Frans, Atherton, and Rainey then ceased booking Gentry into the \nJail and grabbed Gentry by the neck, arms, and head, and forcibly escorted her into a \n“padded cell,” identified on surveillance video as “PD-2.” \n  49.  Defendants then forced Gentry to the floor, held her down, and began to \nforcibly remove her shoes, pants and underwear. \n  9 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 10 of 22 PageID #: 125\n  50.  After stripping her from the waist down, officers removed Gentry’s handcuffs \nand began to remove her shirt and bra. \n  51.  While removing Gentry’s shirt and bra, Defendant Rainey pressed a taser to \nher back and threatened to tase her. \n  52.  Male officers, including Defendant Rainey, were present for and participated \nin stripping Gentry. \n  53.  At approximately 4:15 a.m. officers left the cell, and Gentry was kept naked  \nand alone with only a small blanket (referred to by Jail staff as a “smock”) to cover herself. \n  54.  After approximately 20 minutes, Gentry began to bang on the cell door and \nask officers for clothing. \n  55.  An unknown Defendant officer responded that if Gentry did not “shut up,” he \nwas going to pepper spray her. \n  56.  At approximately 5:12 a.m., an unknown Defendant officer sprayed pepper \nspray into the cell. \n  57.  Gentry’s naked body was exposed to the chemical spray in the closed cell for \napproximately forty (40) minutes. \n  58.  At approximately 6:00 a.m., Gentry was handcuffed behind her back and \ntaken to a washing station to wash the pepper spray off her face. \n  59.  Because she was handcuffed, Gentry was unable to hold the smock so that her \nbody was adequately covered. While walking to and from the wash station, Gentry’s breasts \nand genitals were exposed to male officers and, upon information and belief, male inmates. \n  60.  At 6:20 a.m., Gentry was returned to her cell, still naked with a wet “smock.”  \n  61.  Gentry remained in the cell, naked, for approximately five (5) hours. \n  10 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 126\n  62.  During the time Gentry was in the cell she was deprived of toilet facilities and \nforced to urinated into a floor drain. \n  63.  At approximately 11:00 a.m. officers provided Gentry with a standard-issue \njumpsuit and she was booked into the Jail. \nPlaintiff Vincent Minton \n  64.  Plaintiff Vincent Minton is a twenty-three year old resident of the State of \nIndiana and employee of a local music store. \n  65.  On February 28, 2013, Minton was arrested by New Albany police officers on \nsuspicion of public intoxication, intimidation, and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. \n  66.  Minton was brought to the Floyd County Jail at approximately 2:45 a.m. \n  67.  Minton exercised his right against self-incrimination, and refused to respond \nto questions posed by Jail officers. \n  68.  Minton was subsequently put into a “padded cell.” \n  69.  After some time alone in the cell, Minton began banging on the door and \nrequesting a phone call or access to a lawyer. \n  70.  In response, two unidentified Defendant officers came into the cell, pushed \nMinton against the wall, and then to the ground. \n  71.   The two Defendant officers proceeded to forcibly remove Minton’s shoes, \nsocks, pants, underwear, and shirt. \n  72.   One  Defendant  officer  then  deployed  his  taser,  striking  Plaintiff  in  the \nbuttocks. \n  73.   The officers then left the cell without providing Minton with anything with \nwhich to cover his naked body. \n  11 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 12 of 22 PageID #: 127\n  74.  Approximately  thirty  (30)  minutes  later,  officers  provided  Minton  with  a \n“smock” with which to cover himself. \n  75.  The cell did not contain a toilet, and Minton was forced to urinate into a drain \nin the floor. \n  76.  Minton was held for several hours before officers provided him with any \nclothing. \nPlaintiff Michael Herron \n  77.  Plaintiff Michael Herron is a thirty-six-year-old Army veteran, truck driver, \nand father of two. \n  78.  On January 5, 2014, Herron was arrested by New Albany police officers on \nsuspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct. \n  79.  Herron was taken to the Floyd County Jail in handcuffs at approximately 1:30 \na.m. \n  80.  While being booked into the Jail, Herron questioned unidentified Defendant \nofficers about their processes and procedures. \n  81.  Defendant officers then interrupted the booking process and instructed Herron \nto get up. They walked him to the “padded cell.” \n  82.  After some time in the cell, Herron began to knock on the door and asked to \nmake a phone call. \n  83.  Officers told Herron to “go to sleep,” although there was no mat or cot in the \ncell. \n  84.  Herron was forced to urinate in a drain in the floor. \n  12 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 128\n  85.  Following an additional passage of time, Herron began banging on the door \nand wall of the cell. \n  86.  Unknown Defendant officers then entered the cell and directed Herron to face \nthe wall and then get on the ground. \n  87.  Herron complied with officers’ orders and was then held down by three male \nand one female officer by his legs, neck, and arms. \n  88.  Defendant officers then removed his shoes, socks, pants, underwear, and shirt. \n  89.  Defendants left the cell and gave Herron a “smock” which was too small to \nadequately cover himself. \n  90.  One unidentified officer instructed Herron “go to sleep or I’ll pepper spray \nyou.” \n  91.  Herron attempted to cover himself with the smock while laying on the floor of \nthe cell, however the smock did not adequately cover his body. \n  92.  At approximately 8:00 a.m., Herron was given his street clothes, and was later \nbooked and released. \nPlaintiff Adam Walker \n  93.  Plaintiff Adam Walker is a thirty-one-year-old Army veteran, small business \nowner, and a resident of the State of Indiana. \n  94.  On May 24, 2014, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Walker was arrested by Floyd \nCounty  Sheriff  Deputies  on  suspicion  of  operating  a  vehicle  while  intoxicated,  a \nmisdemeanor. \n  95.  Walker disputed the charge and agreed to voluntarily accompany the Deputy \nto the Floyd County Jail to take a breathalyzer test. \n  13 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 129\n  96.  Walker blew into the breathalyzer three times over the course of one hour.  \nEach time the machine gave an error message. \n  97.  Walker was cooperative and was not handcuffed during this time. \n  98.  While sitting on a bench, three unidentified Defendant officers approached \nWalker and one officer winked at him. \n  99.  Walker  asked  the  officer  why  he  winked  at  him,  and  the  officer  denied \nwinking at him. \n  100.  The two argued briefly over whether the officer winked at him, when the three \ndeputies descended on Walker, threw him to the ground, and handcuffed him. \n  101.  While handcuffed, officers tased Walker seven times and choked him until he \nlost consciousness. \n  102.  Walker regained consciousness while being dragged into the “padded cell.” \n  103.  Defendants then forcibly removed Walker’s shoes, socks, and jeans. Then, \nthey removed his handcuffs and removed his shirt. \n  104.  Defendants left Walker alone in the cell with nothing to cover himself. \n  105.  After a period of time, Walker began to beat on the door and complain that the \nroom had no heat and he was cold. In response, officers provided Walker with a “smock.” \n  106.  After the next shift of officers arrived at the Jail, Walker asked to use a \nbathroom. He was told that the drain in the floor was his bathroom. \n  107.  After approximately 18 hours in the cell, the officer who winked at Walker the \nnight before came to the door and asked, “Are you docile?” Walker was then given a prison \njumpsuit to wear and a mat to lay on. \n  14 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 130\n  108.  While in the Jail, Walker also witnessed another detainee get forcibly stripped \nby officers and put into another padded cell. During the course of this detainee’s forcible \nstriping, Walker witnessed the officers pull the detainee’s feet out from under him so that the \ndetainee fell to the floor headfirst and knocked out his teeth. \n  109.  Walker suffers from a variety of combat injuries, including a gunshot wound, \nspinal compression fracture, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress. \n  110.  Walker was held in the booking area for four (4) days. During this time, Jail \nstaff  refused  to  provide  him  with  medications,  including  anti-seizure  medication  and \nantibiotics. When Walker advised officers that he needed seizure medication, an officer told \nhim, “Well, you’d better not have a seizure.” \nPlaintiff Janelle South \n  111.  Janelle South is a thirty-four year old cancer survivor. At the time of the \nincidents  described  below,  South  had  just  completed  a  three-month  radiation  treatment \nregimen. \n  112.  South was arrested by Indiana State Police on February 9, 2014 on her way \nhome from a funeral. She was charged with a misdemeanor alcohol-related offense.  \n  113.  Upon entry into the Floyd County Jail, South was almost immediately taken \ninto a padded cell.  \n  114.  While  South  was  in  the  padded  cell,  the  arresting  officer,  Mike  Davis, \nrepeatedly came to the window to taunt South by making faces and inflammatory comments. \n  115.  South  repeatedly  requested  medical  attention.  After  several  requests,  an \nunknown female deputy opened the flap in the door and sprayed the cell with pepper spray. \n  116.  Some of the pepper spray blew back on the deputy. \n  15 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 16 of 22 PageID #: 131\n  117.  Without warning, the unknown female deputy entered the padded cell and \nforcibly stripped South of her clothing. \n  118.  South was given a smock to cover herself with, but the Velcro on the smock \nwas too worn to allow South to fasten the smock to cover herself. \n  119.  After approximately thirty minutes, South was taken to the shower to rinse off \nthe pepper spray. \n  120.  Following the shower, South was not given a towel to dry off with or any \nclothing. She was returned to the padded cell wet and with no clothing, save the smock. \n  121.  South was not given a mat to lay on, and instead lay on the floor and used a \nroll of toilet paper for a head rest. \n  122.  Deputies refused South’s requests for access to the bathroom and instructed \nher to use the drain in the floor. The drain in the floor appeared to have been previously used \nby another inmate. \n  123.  During the twelve hours South was unclothed in the padded cell, male inmates \nperiodically looked through the cell window. \nPlaintiff Brian Burgess \n  124.  Brian Burgess is a forty-three-year-old resident of the state of Indiana, and is \nemployed by a roofing and restoration company. He served in the U.S. Air Force during the \nfirst gulf war, and was given an honorable discharge in 1993. \n  125.  Burgess was arrested by Indiana State Police on November 29, 2013, for \nallegedly swapping pricing labels on a pair of jeans at a local retailer. \n  126.  Burgess was thereafter held by Defendants at the Floyd County Jail until \nDecember 2, 2013.  \n  16 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 17 of 22 PageID #: 132\n  127.  Burgess  repeatedly  requested  to  be  able  to  make  a  phone  call  to  secure \nrepresentation. \n  128.    Burgess was denied access to a phone by Defendants for the entirety of his \nincarceration. \n  129.  Defendants strip-searched Burgess upon his initial confinement, but did not \nreturn his clothes to him or allow him to wear a jumpsuit while he was detained.  \n  130.  Defendants gave Burgess a “smock” to wear. This smock did not cover his \nentire body, and left his genitalia exposed.  \n  131.  Despite his exposure, Defendants led him through an area of the jail which left \nhim in full view of other inmates and female officers. \n  132.  Despite  his  repeated  requests,  Defendants  denied  him  access  to  his \nprescription anti-inflammatory medication during his detention. \n  133.  When he complained about his conditions, Defendants told Burgess “If you \ndon't like being in jail, you shouldn't be a street junkie.” \n  134.  Burgess  was  not  given  a  jumpsuit  to  wear  until  30  minutes  before  his \narraignment on December 2. \n   135.  After his initial court appearance, Defendants forced Burgess to remove all of \nhis clothing and put on a smock again. \n  136.  During his detention, Burgess was forced to stay in unsanitary conditions and \nto urinate into a drain in the floor. \nPlaintiff Anna Chastain \n  137.  Plaintiff Anna Chastain is a resident of the state of Indiana, a mother, and an \nemployee of a packing and shipping facility. \n  17 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 18 of 22 PageID #: 133\n  138.  Chastain was apprehended by police on or about December 31, 2013, on \nsuspicion of public intoxication.  \n  139.  At the time of her arrest, police told her she had the option of going to the \nhospital or going to jail.  \n  140.  Chastain had no significant criminal history at the time of her arrest. \n  141.  Chastain did not want or need to be taken to the hospital, and was afraid she \nwould incur charges there that she would not be able to pay. \n  142.  Chastain was transported to the Floyd County Jail, and her personal property \nwas confiscated.  \n  143.  When she asked Defendants to see a record of her personal property, she was \nslammed on the ground by three officers, resulting in a black eye and a laceration on her lip.  \n  144.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, Chastain weighed approximately 95 \nlbs. and stood approximately five feet, two inches in height. \n  145.  Defendants forced Chastain to remove all of her clothing and placed her in an \nisolation cell. \n   146.  During  this  time,  Ms.  Chastain  informed  Defendants  that  she  was \nmenstruating. Nonetheless, Chastain was forced by Defendants to remove the sanitary pad \nshe was wearing, leaving her to menstruate on the cell floor. \n  147.  Defendants  refused  to  bring  Chastain  any  feminine  hygiene  products  for \napproximately 4 hours, and refused any clothing for approximately 9 hours. \n   \n  18 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 134\nLEGAL CLAIMS \n42 U.S.C. §1983 \n \n  148.  Defendants were acting under the color of state law when they undertook the \nactions described above. \n  149.  Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n  150.  The abuses to which Plaintiffs and the class were subjected, as described \nabove, were part of a continuing pattern of misconduct and were the result of Defendant's \nwritten policies or procedures and/or unwritten customs and practices that are systematically \napplied to arrestees/detainees. \n  151.  As  a  state  actor,  Defendant's  practices  constitute  an  arbitrary  use  of \ngovernment  power,  and  evince  a  total,  intentional  and  unreasonable  disregard  for  the \nconstitutional and common law rights of the citizens of Indiana, including Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the \nsystematic pursuit of such practices. \n  152.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class, through Defendants' \nintentional or grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the \nfollowing non-exhaustive list of rights and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution \nof the United States in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983: \na.  Their right to freedom of speech without fear of retaliation \nunder the First Amendment; \n   \nb.  Their right to be secure in their person against unreasonable \nsearches  and  seizures  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n \n  19 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 20 of 22 PageID #: 135\nc.  Their right to privacy in their person against unreasonable \nintrusions  under  the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n \nd.  Their right to the equal protection of the law, procedural due  \nprocess, and substantive due process secured by the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendment; \n \ne.  The right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment secured  \nby the Eighth Amendment; and \n \nf.  The right to be free of excessive force. \n \n  153.  Defendant's  conduct  also  violated  concomitant  rights  guaranteed  by  the \nConstitution and common laws of Indiana. \n  154.  Moreover,  given  the  pre-existing  law  that  clearly  prohibited  Defendants' \nconduct,  Defendants'  abuse  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  was  intentional, \nwanton  and  malicious,  and  indicative  of  Defendants’  total  and  reckless  disregard \nof/deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and the class. \nFailure to Train \n  155.  In  addition,  Defendants  were  negligent  and/or  deliberately  indifferent  to \nDefendant  officers’  need  for  training  regarding  unlawful  searches  and  seizures,  the \nreasonable use of force, and the rights of pre-trial arrestees/detainees. \n  156. As a result of Defendants’ failure to train the officers, the officers violated \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n  157.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned conduct, Plaintiffs \nhave suffered physical harm, emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, and mental \nanguish. \n  20 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 21 of 22 PageID #: 136\nDamages \n  158.  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  were  unjustifiably  and \nunconstitutionally  treated  in  a  manner  that  generated  tremendous  and  overwhelming \nembarrassment,  humiliation,  and  mental  and  emotional  distress.  As  a  result,  they  have \nsuffered, and are entitled to recover, actual damages. \n  159.  Furthermore, Defendants' violations of the constitutional and common law \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the class were cruel, malicious and evinced a total and reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover \npunitive damages from Defendant in order to deter such conduct in the future. \nDeclaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n  160.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class request that this Court \nissue  a  declaratory  judgment  deeming  unconstitutional  any  and  all  written  policies  or \nprocedures,  and/or  unwritten  customs  or  practices  under  which  they  were  forced  to  be \nsubmitted to Defendants' humiliating and/or torturous practices, and further request that this \nCourt permanently enjoin Defendants from following or enforcing such written policies or \nprocedures,  and/or  unwritten  customs  or  practices  subjecting  detainees  to  gratuitous, \nunnecessary  humiliation,  excessive  punishment,  torture,  and/or  unreasonable  search  and \nseizures. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent request: \n  A.  That this action proceed as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1-3); \n  B.  A trial by jury; \n  C.  An award of actual and punitive damages to Plaintiffs and all members of the \nclass; \n  21 \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 17   Filed 11/12/14   Page 22 of 22 PageID #: 137\n  D.

Plaintiffs  Tabitha  Gentry,  Vincent  Minton,  Michael  Herron,  and  Adam \nWalker file this action in their individual capacities and on behalf of all persons stripped, \nheld naked, tortured, humiliated, and abused by Defendants as a regular part of Defendants' \npolicies, procedures, and protocol. \n2.  This class of people includes all individuals who were so treated from June \n12, 2012, to the present. \n3.  Such treatment has been regularly perpetrated by Defendants and there are \npotentially hundreds of members of this class. \n4.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  in  this  case  that  are  common  to  all \nmembers of this class.   \n5.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the class, and they will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of this class. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n  6.  Plaintiffs, and all other similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages \nfrom  Defendants  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1871,  42  U.S.C.  §1983,  for  gross  and \nunconscionable violations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \nStates. \n  7.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§1331 and §1343. \n\t\r   3\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 4\n  8.  Plaintiffs  and  the  other  members  of  the  class  also  seek  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief. \n  9.  As Floyd County, Indiana is the location of all acts on which Plaintiff's claims \nare based, venue is proper in this Court. \n \nCLASS ACTION \n \n10.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), (2) and \n(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n11.  The class consists of all individuals who, since June 12, 2013, were forcibly \nstripped of their clothing, and kept in a state of undress for prolonged periods of time, \nwhether as a punitive measure, or as a torture method, or under the pretext of a search and \nseizure, or any other reason.  \n12.  This class also consists of individuals who were subjected to the use of pepper \nspray, taser, or other unnecessary and unwarranted means of excessive force while being held \nunder these conditions. \n 13.  Plaintiffs and other members of the class were subjected to such treatment \ndespite the absence of any reasonable, individualized suspicion or probable cause required by \nlaw. \n14.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members.  \nThey are members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class members. \n15.  Plaintiffs were harmed and offended by the treatment accorded them and will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.   \n\t\r   4\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 5 of 19 PageID #: 5\n16.  Plaintiffs’  interest  in  obtaining  injunctive  relief  and  actual  and  punitive \ndamages for the violations of their constitutional rights and privileges are consistent with and \nnot antagonistic of those of any other person within the class. \n17.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non  information  and  belief,  that  Defendants  regularly  forcibly  remove  the  clothing  of \narrestees/detainees, and leave them without clothing for prolonged periods of time, despite \nthe absence of any reasonable, individualized suspicion, probable cause, threat, security \ninterest, or provocation that would justify such an extreme sanction. \n18.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly expose such detainees’ naked bodies to \nofficers of the opposite sex either through conducting the forcible removal of clothing, \nthrough the subsequent withholding of clothing while in view of Jail employees, or through \nvideo surveillance of detainees’ naked bodies. \n19.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly expose such detainees’ naked bodies to \nharmful and extremely offensive touching. \n20.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non  information  and  belief,  that  Defendants  regularly  subject  detainees  to  unnecessary, \nunwarranted, and excessive uses of force during and following the removal of their clothing \ndespite the absence of any provocation, legitimate security or law enforcement interest, \nprobable cause, or articulable individualized suspicion. \n\t\r   5\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 6\n21.  Given the circumstances of their detention, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, \non information and belief, that Defendants regularly deprive such detainees of access to \nbathroom facilities, and force detainees to void into a floor drain. \n22.  In addition, upon information and belief, video footage was taken of the above \nabuses. This video footage, which includes clear and graphic depictions of Plaintiffs' naked \nbodies, is available to other members of Floyd County government, and to the general \npublic.1  \n23.  Such  abuses  violate  the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  42  U.S.C.  §1983,  and  clearly \nestablished law.   \n24.  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  are  entitled  to  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief and an award of compensatory and punitive damages. \n25.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \na.  A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \n \nb.  It would be virtually impossible for all class members \nto intervene as parties-plaintiffs in this action. \n \nc.  Upon adjudication of Defendants' liability, claims of \nthe class members can be determined by this Court. \n \nNATURE OF DEFENDANTS' CONDUCT \n26.  The  conduct  of  the  Defendants  constitutes  torture,  and  violates  well-\nestablished, longstanding national and international norms.  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n1\t\r   Video footage of Plaintiff Tabitha Gentry was obtained through a request pursuant to the Indiana Access to \nPublic Records Act, IC § 5-14-3. \n\t\r   6\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 7\n27.  Defendants' treatment of Plaintiffs and other class members is intolerable in a \ncivilized society, and presents a marked departure from the standard to which the Western \nworld adheres for the treatment of prisoners of war during wartime, let alone the standard of \nacceptable treatment for American citizens on American soil. \n28.  Defendants engaged in the conduct described below under color of the law of \nthe State of Indiana and Floyd County. \n29.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of Defendants Floyd \nCounty and Darrell Mills to employ qualified persons for positions of authority, to properly \nor conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, \nand/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by \ncustom to protect the constitutional rights of American citizens.  \n 30.  Defendants’ conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active \nmalice toward Plaintiffs and the class, or constitutes a total and reckless disregard for and \nindifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional and common law rights, justifying an award of \npunitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs and the class are entitled \nto recover. \nPARTIES \n  31.  Plaintiff Tabitha Gentry (“Gentry”) is, and at all times relevant herein was, a \nresident of Floyd County, Indiana. \n  32.

Plaintiff Tabitha Gentry is a thirty-two-year-old mother of four. \n40.  On  March  30,  2014  at  approximately  4:00  a.m.,  Gentry  was  arrested  on \nsuspicion  of  public  intoxication,  disorderly  conduct,  and  resisting  law  enforcement,  all \nmisdemeanor offenses. \n\t\r   8\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: 9\n  41.  Indiana State Police transported Gentry to the Floyd County Jail. \n42.  Upon arriving at the Floyd County Jail, Gentry was escorted, in handcuffs, to \nthe “remand room.” \n  43.  While  waiting  to  be  booked,  Gentry  had  a  verbal  altercation  with  three \nDefendant officers. \n  44.  During this verbal exchange, Gentry was seated on a bench and her hands \nwere cuffed behind her back. \n  45.  Defendants Frans, Atherton, and Rainey then ceased booking Gentry into the \nJail and grabbed Gentry by the neck, arms, and head, and forcibly escorted her into a \n“padded cell,” identified on surveillance video as “PD-2.” \n46.  Defendants then forced Gentry to the floor, held her down, and began to \nforcibly remove her shoes, pants and underwear. \n  47.  After stripping her from the waist down, officers removed Gentry’s handcuffs \nand began to remove her shirt and bra. \n  48.  While removing Gentry’s shirt and bra, Defendant Rainey pressed a taser to \nher back and threatened to tase her.  \n  49.  Male officers, including Defendant Rainey, were present for and participated \nin stripping Gentry. \n  50.  At approximately 4:15 a.m. officers left the cell, and Gentry was kept naked \nand alone with only a small blanket (referred to by Jail staff as a “smock”) to cover herself. \n51.  After approximately 20 minutes, Gentry began to bang on the cell door and \nask officers for clothing.  \n\t\r   9\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 10\n  52.  An unknown Defendant officer responded that if Gentry did not “shut up,” he \nwas going to pepper spray her. \n  53.  At approximately 5:12 a.m., an unknown Defendant officer sprayed pepper \nspray into the cell. \n  54.  Gentry’s naked body was exposed to the chemical spray in the closed cell for \napproximately forty (40) minutes. \n55.  At approximately 6:00 a.m., Gentry was handcuffed behind her back and \ntaken to a washing station to wash the pepper spray off her face. \n56.  Because she was handcuffed, Gentry was unable to hold the smock so that her \nbody was adequately covered. While walking to and from the wash station, Gentry’s breasts \nand genitals were exposed to male officers and, upon information and belief, male inmates.  \n  57.  At 6:20 a.m., Gentry was returned to her cell, still naked with a wet “smock.”  \n58.  Gentry remained in the cell, naked, for approximately five (5) hours. \n59.  During the time Gentry was in the cell she was deprived of toilet facilities and \nforced to urinated into a floor drain. \n  60.  At approximately 11:00 a.m. officers provided Gentry with a standard-issue \njumpsuit and she was booked into the Jail.  \n \nPlaintiff Vincent Minton \n \n  61.  Plaintiff Vincent Minton is a twenty-three year old resident of the State of \nIndiana and employee of a local music store. \n62.  On February 28, 2013, Minton was arrested by New Albany police officers on \nsuspicion of public intoxication, intimidation, and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. \n  63.  Minton was brought to the Floyd County Jail at approximately 2:45 a.m. \n\t\r   10\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 11\n  64.  Minton exercised his right against self-incrimination, and refused to respond \nto questions posed by Jail officers. \n  65.  Minton was subsequently put into a “padded cell.” \n  66.  After some time alone in the cell, Minton began banging on the door and \nrequesting a phone call or access to a lawyer. \n  67.  In response, two unidentified Defendant officers came into the cell, pushed \nMinton against the wall, and then to the ground. \n  68.  The two Defendant officers proceeded to forcibly remove Minton’s shoes, \nsocks, pants, underwear, and shirt.  \n  69.  One  Defendant  officer  then  deployed  his  taser,  striking  Plaintiff  in  the \nbuttocks.  \n  70.  The officers then left the cell without providing Minton with anything with \nwhich to cover his naked body.  \n  71.  Approximately  thirty  (30)  minutes  later,  officers  provided  Minton  with  a \n“smock” with which to cover himself. \n  72.  The cell did not contain a toilet, and Minton was forced to urinate into a drain \nin the floor. \n  73.  Minton was held for several hours before officers provided him with any \nclothing. \n \nPlaintiff Michael Herron \n  74.  Plaintiff Michael Herron is a thirty-six-year-old Army veteran, truck driver, \nand father of two. \n\t\r   11\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 12\n  75.  On January 5, 2014, Herron was arrested by New Albany police officers on \nsuspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct. \n  76.  Herron was taken to the Floyd County Jail in handcuffs at approximately 1:30 \na.m. \n  77.  While being booked into the Jail, Herron questioned unidentified Defendant \nofficers about their processes and procedures. \n  78.  Defendant officers then interrupted the booking process and instructed Herron \nto get up. They walked him to the “padded cell.” \n  79.  After some time in the cell, Herron began to knock on the door and asked to \nmake a phone call. \n  80.  Officers told Herron to “go to sleep,” although there was no mat or cot in the \ncell. \n  81.  Herron was forced to urinate in a drain in the floor. \n  82.  Following an additional passage of time, Herron began banging on the door \nand wall of the cell. \n  83.  Unknown Defendant officers then entered the cell and directed Herron to face \nthe wall and then get on the ground. \n  84.  Herron complied with officers’ orders and was then held down by three male \nand one female officer by his legs, neck, and arms.  \n  85.  Defendant officers then removed his shoes, socks, pants, underwear, and shirt. \n  86.  Defendants left the cell and gave Herron a “smock” which was too small to \nadequately cover himself. \n\t\r   12\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 13\n  87.  One unidentified officer instructed Herron “go to sleep or I’ll pepper spray \nyou.” \n  88.  Herron attempted to cover himself with the smock while laying on the floor of \nthe cell, however the smock did not adequately cover his body. \n  89.  At approximately 8:00 a.m., Herron was given his street clothes, and was later \nbooked and released. \nPlaintiff Adam Walker \n  90.  Plaintiff Adam Walker is a thirty-one-year-old Army veteran, small business \nowner, and a resident of the State of Indiana. \n  91.  On May 24, 2014, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Walker was arrested by Floyd \nCounty  Sheriff  Deputies  on  suspicion  of  operating  a  vehicle  while  intoxicated,  a \nmisdemeanor. \n  92.  Walker disputed the charge and agreed to voluntarily accompany the Deputy \nto the Floyd County Jail to take a breathalyzer test. \n  93.  Walker blew into the breathalyzer three times over the course of one hour. \nEach time the machine gave an error message. \n  94.  Walker was cooperative and was not handcuffed during this time. \n  95.  While sitting on a bench, three unidentified Defendant officers approached \nWalker and one officer winked at him. \n  96.  Walker  asked  the  officer  why  he  winked  at  him,  and  the  officer  denied \nwinking at him.  \n97.  The two argued briefly over whether the officer winked at him, when the three \ndeputies descended on Walker, threw him to the ground, and handcuffed him. \n\t\r   13\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 14\n98.  While handcuffed, officers tased Walker seven times and choked him until he \nlost consciousness. \n99.  Walker regained consciousness while being dragged into the “padded cell.” \n100.  Defendants then forcibly removed Walker’s shoes, socks, and jeans. Then, \nthey removed his handcuffs and removed his shirt. \n101.  Defendants left Walker alone in the cell with nothing to cover himself. \n102.  After a period of time, Walker began to beat on the door and complain that the \nroom had no heat and he was cold. In response, officers provided Walker with a “smock.” \n103.  After the next shift of officers arrived at the Jail, Walker asked to use a \nbathroom. He was told that the drain in the floor was his bathroom. \n104.  After approximately 18 hours in the cell, the officer who winked at Walker the \nnight before came to the door and asked, “Are you docile?” Walker was then given a prison \njumpsuit to wear and a mat to lay on. \n105.  While in the Jail, Walker also witnessed another detainee get forcibly stripped \nby officers and put into another padded cell. During the course of this detainee’s forcible \nstriping, Walker witnessed the officers pull the detainee’s feet out from under him so that the \ndetainee fell to the floor headfirst and knocked out his teeth.  \n106.  Walker suffers from a variety of combat injuries, including a gunshot wound, \nspinal compression fracture, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress. \n107.  Walker was held in the booking area for four (4) days. During this time, Jail \nstaff  refused  to  provide  him  with  medications,  including  anti-seizure  medication  and \nantibiotics. When Walker advised officers that he needed seizure medication, an officer told \nhim, “Well, you’d better not have a seizure.” \n\t\r   14\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 15\n   \n          LEGAL CLAIMS \n42 U.S.C. §1983 \n \n108.  Defendants were acting under the color of state law when they undertook the \nactions described above. \n   109.  Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n110.  The abuses to which Plaintiffs and the class were subjected, as described \nabove, were part of a continuing pattern of misconduct and were the result of Defendant's \nwritten policies or procedures and/or unwritten customs and practices that are systematically \napplied to arrestees/detainees. \n  111.  As  a  state  actor,  Defendant's  practices  constitute  an  arbitrary  use  of \ngovernment  power,  and  evince  a  total,  intentional  and  unreasonable  disregard  for  the \nconstitutional and common law rights of the citizens of Indiana, including Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the \nsystematic pursuit of such practices. \n  112.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class, through Defendants' \nintentional or grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the \nfollowing non-exhaustive list of rights and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution \nof the United States in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983: \na.  Their right to be secure in their person against unreasonable searches \nand seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; \n \nb.  Their right to privacy in their person against unreasonable intrusions \nunder the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments;   \n \n\t\r   15\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: 16\nc.  Their right to the equal protection of the law, procedural due process, \nand substantive due process secured by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment; \n \nd.  The right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment secured by the \nEighth Amendment; and \n \ne.   The right to be free of excessive force. \n \n  113.  Defendant's  conduct  also  violated  concomitant  rights  guaranteed  by  the \nConstitution and common laws of Indiana. \n114.  Moreover,  given  the  pre-existing  law  that  clearly  prohibited  Defendants' \nconduct,  Defendants'  abuse  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  was  intentional, \nwanton  and  malicious,  and  indicative  of  Defendants’  total  and  reckless  disregard \nof/deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and the class. \nFailure to Train \n   \n115.  In  addition,  Defendants  were  negligent  and/or  deliberately  indifferent  to \nDefendant  officers’  need  for  training  regarding  unlawful  searches  and  seizures,  the \nreasonable use of force, and the rights of pre-trial arrestees/detainees. \n116.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to train the officers, the officers violated \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  \n117.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned conduct, Plaintiffs \nhave suffered physical harm, emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, and mental \nanguish. \nDamages \n118.  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  were  unjustifiably  and \nunconstitutionally  treated  in  a  manner  that  generated  tremendous  and  overwhelming \n\t\r   16\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: 17\nembarrassment, humiliation, and mental and emotional distress.  As a result, they have \nsuffered, and are entitled to recover, actual damages. \n119.  Furthermore, Defendants' violations of the constitutional and common law \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the class were cruel, malicious and evinced a total and reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover \npunitive damages from Defendant in order to deter such conduct in the future. \nDeclaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n  120.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class request that this Court \nissue  a  declaratory  judgment  deeming  unconstitutional  any  and  all  written  policies  or \nprocedures,  and/or  unwritten  customs  or  practices  under  which  they  were  forced  to  be \nsubmitted to Defendants' humiliating and/or torturous practices, and further request that this \nCourt permanently enjoin Defendants from following or enforcing such written policies or \nprocedures,  and/or  unwritten  customs  or  practices  subjecting  detainees  to  gratuitous, \nunnecessary  humiliation,  excessive  punishment,  torture,  and/or  unreasonable  search  and \nseizures. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent request:  \n  A.  That this action proceed as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23;  \n  B.  a trial by jury; \n  C.  an award of actual and punitive damages to Plaintiffs and all members of the \nclass; \n  D.  the declaratory and injunctive relief requested herein; and \n  E.  an award of their costs and attorney fees and all other relief to which they are \nentitled under law or in equity. \n\t\r   17\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 18 of 19 PageID #: 18\n             \n\t\r   18\t\r  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 1   Filed 06/12/14   Page 19 of 19 PageID #: 19\n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Laura E.

The Parties agree \nto use the records maintained by the Floyd County Jail to determine \nthose individuals, as summarized in Exhibit B.  \n \n(c)  Class Members who are  Medicare eligible and for whom it is \ndetermined Medicare has a lien, and who submit a valid claim and were \nsubjected to the deployment of tasers or pepper spray while held under \nthe Combative Subjects Policy shall receive Three Thousand Dollars \n($3,000.00) plus the amount they receive as a class member as \nidentified in subparagraph (d) below minus any amount due Medicare. \nPayment will be released after the Defendants have confirmed the \namount of the lien and have so informed the Settlement Administrator \nof the amount due the Class Member and the amount due Medicare.  \nThe Parties agree to use the records maintained by the Floyd County \nJail to determine those individuals, as summarized in Exhibit B.  \n \n \n(d)  The total amount remaining in the Settlement Fund after deduction of \nattorneys'  fees,  costs,  incentive  awards,  and  payments  pursuant  to \nParagraph 1(a) will be divided by the total number of Class Members \nwho submit a valid claim. \n \n(e)  If  the  award  described  in  Paragraph  1(d)  exceeds  Twenty  Five \nThousand  Dollars  ($25,000.00)  per  Class  Member,  the  amount  in \nexcess of such award shall be refunded to Defendants.  \n (f)  If any checks are not cashed within three (3) months of the distribution, the \n  Settlement Administrator will notify the Parties of the identities of those \n  Claimants who failed to cash their check. If there is money remaining in \n  the Settlement Fund three (3) months after the payment to the Class \n  Members who make valid claims, then that money will be redistributed \n  pursuant to Paragraphs 1(d) and (e) above.  However, if money is to be \n  redistributed because there are unclaimed funds, no class member shall be \n  entitled to more than $25,000.00 (excluding incentive awards and \n  payments made under paragraph 1(a) above) and if all class members  \n  receive that amount and unclaimed funds still exist, the unclaimed funds \n  will revert to the Defendants. \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 125-2   Filed 07/23/17   Page 10 of 25 PageID #:\n 1707\n2.  Records have been provided by Defendants in order to acquire the name \nand address of each Class Member. The Parties will cause to be mailed to each Class \nMember the Class Notice and Claim Form with return envelopes for Class Members to \nmail back. Upon completion of their Claim Form, the Class Members will insert their \ncompleted Claim Form into the provided return envelope to mail to the Settlement \nAdministrator. \n \n3.  The  Settlement  Administrator  shall  compile  a  list  of  class  members \nsubmitting claims to be provided to all Parties.  \n \n4.  The Parties recognize the possibility that Class Members may attempt to \nfile late claims subsequent to the end of the claims period. Late claims may be allowed, \nif submitted on or before 30 days after the end of the claims period, for good cause \nshown as agreed by the Parties.  However any claims submitted more than thirty (30) \ndays after the end of the claim period shall not be allowed. To the extent that the Parties \ncannot agree that good cause is shown, the Settlement Administrator shall make the final \ndecision regarding whether to allow a late claim.   All late claims will be approved by \nthe Court prior to being paid as part of the distribution of the Settlement. \n \n5.  After  the  Final  Approval  Hearing  described  below,  the  Settlement \nAdministrator shall send checks to each Claimant who submits a valid claim pursuant to \nthe distribution calculated in Section III(B) within fourteen (14) days of the Effective \nDate. If after three (3) months a check remains uncashed and money remains in what is \nleft of the Settlement Fund, the remainder shall be redistributed among Claimants as \nprovided under Section III(B) with no Class Member receiving more than $25,000.00.  \n \n6.  The Parties expressly agree that the funds paid herein are not intended to \nbe payment for economic damages or for punitive damages, but are intended to be \npayment for damages on account of alleged personal injuries, including, but not limited \nto, bodily injury, mental and emotional distress, and pain and suffering, arising from an \noccurrence, within the meaning of Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986,  as  amended.  Despite  the  Parties'  intentions,  the  Plaintiffs,  Class  Counsel, \nDefendants’ Counsel, and Defendants make no representations regarding the taxability or \nnon-taxability of any payments made hereunder, and the Parties agree that Defendants, \nthe  Settlement  Administrator,  and  Defendants’  insurers  shall  not  be  responsible  for \npayment of any taxes on the amounts paid hereunder to Plaintiffs, Class Representatives, \nClass Members, or Class Counsel. All payment of taxes or other assessments to the state \nor federal authorities on the amounts paid under this Settlement Agreement, if any, shall \nbe the sole responsibility of Plaintiffs, Class Representatives, Class Members, and Class \nCounsel with respect to their portion of the Settlement Funds.  \n \nC.  Attorneys' Fees and Expenses \n \n  Class Counsel will petition the Court for an award of attorneys' fees in the amount \nof 37% of the entire Settlement Amount. The Plaintiffs and Class Counsel assert such an \namount  is  reasonable  in  light  of  the  effort  expended  in  litigating  this  case,  the \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 125-2   Filed 07/23/17   Page 11 of 25 PageID #:\n 1708\nsignificance of the relief obtained for the Class Members, and the efficiency with which \nnegotiation of equitable and compensatory relief was obtained. Class Counsel also will \nrequest reimbursement from the Settlement Fund for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in \nlitigating  these  claims  and  administering  the  settlement  distribution.  Class  Counsel \nestimates  this  amount  to  be  approximately  $45,000.00.  Defendants  and  Defendants’ \ncounsel do not object to these requests. In the event that the Court does not approve the \nrequested amount of attorneys' fees and costs, and approves some lesser amount, that fact \nwill not void this Settlement Agreement; provided, however, that Class Counsel reserves \nthe right to appeal any such decision. The Parties agree the Settlement will proceed as \nspecified  in  this  Agreement  regardless  of  the  amount  of  attorneys'  fees  and  costs \napproved and awarded by the Court. Class Counsel will be paid from the Settlement \nFund for their attorneys' fees and costs approved by the Court within ten (10) days of the \nEffective Date. \n \nD.  Policy and Training. \n \n  1.  As part of the consideration for this Settlement Agreement, Defendants \naffirmatively represent that the Combative Subjects policy, as described in Exhibit D is no \nlonger in effect at the Floyd County Jail, and will not be reinstated. \n   \n  2.  In addition to the payments described above, Defendants agree to the \nfollowing: \n \n(a)  Field Training Officers employed by the Floyd County Sheriff’s Department \nwill be independently certified;  \n \n(b)  All new jail employees with responsibility for inmate supervision will \nundergo employee orientation and receive training for handling inmates \nbefore working with inmates; \n \n(c)  The Jail’s Facility Supervisor, Security Supervisor, and Classifications \nOfficer will attend Inmate Behavior Management Training conducted by the \nNational Institute of Corrections in May or July, 2017. \n \nIV.

In the event a \nnew address is located, the Settlement Administrator will ensure another Class Notice \nand Claim Form is mailed to the new address. \n7.  Prior to the Final Approval Hearing, the Settlement Administrator shall \nprovide an affidavit to the Court, with a copy to Class Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel, \nrecounting  all  actions  taken  to  provide  Notice  of  the  Settlement.  The  Settlement \nAdministrator will further provide an affidavit recounting any and all activity on the \nSettlement  Website,  including  number  of  visitors  and  number  of  documents \ndownloaded, and any and all activity through correspondence of e-mail or the toll-free \ntelephone  number  between  the  Settlement  Administrator  and  the  potential  Class \nMembers. \n8.  The Settlement Administrator (and any person retained by the Settlement \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 125-2   Filed 07/23/17   Page 13 of 25 PageID #:\n 1710\nAdministrator) shall sign a confidentiality agreement in a form agreed upon by the \nParties,  which  shall  provide  that  the  names,  addresses  and  other  information  about \nspecific  Class  Members  and/or  specific  Class  Members  that  is  provided  to  it  by \nDefendant,  Class  Counsel,  or  by  individual  Class  Members,  shall  be  treated  as \nconfidential and shall be used only the Settlement Administrator as required by this \nSettlement Agreement. \n \n9.  Claim Forms must be postmarked on or before the 45th day from the Notice \nDate in order to be considered timely submitted, however, Claim Forms postmarked \nafter this date shall be accepted by the Parties if received before the Final Approval \nHearing and submitted in good faith within thirty (30) days after the 45th day from the \nNotice Date and the Settlement Administrator finds good cause exists to accept the late \nClaim Form. \n \n10.  The Settlement Administrator will advise Class Counsel and Defendants’ \nCounsel with information regarding who has filed Claim Forms within five (5) business \ndays after the end of  the Claim Period. If information on a submitted Claim Form is \ninsufficient, unreadable, incomplete, or left blank, the Settlement Administrator shall \ncontact the person who submitted the Claim Form and aid the person in completing the \ninformation. \n \n11.  The  Settlement  Administrator  shall  have  final  authority  to  determine \nwhether individuals who have submitted Claims Forms qualify as Settlement Class \nMembers.  The Parties shall have the right to challenge the Settlement Administrator’s \ndetermination of class eligibility at the Final Fairness Hearing. \n \n \nV.  REQUESTS FOR EXCLUSION BY SETTLEMENT CLASS MEMBERS \n  A.  The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to any Request for \nExclusion.

Not  later  than  three  (3)  business  days  after  the  deadline  for \nsubmission of Requests for Exclusion, the Settlement Administrator shall provide an \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 125-2   Filed 07/23/17   Page 14 of 25 PageID #:\n 1711\nOpt-Out List to Class Counsel and to Defendants’ Counsel together with copies of \neach Request for Exclusion.

On May 23, 2017, this Court preliminarily approved \nthis settlement.   \nThe matter having been submitted and good cause appearing therefore, the Court \nfinds as follows:  \n1.  All defined terms contained herein have the same meaning as set forth in  the  \nClass Action Settlement Agreement executed by the Settling Parties  and  filed  with this Court \n(“Settlement Agreement”).  \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 129   Filed 08/02/17   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 1870\n2.  Notice in this case was completed by the administrator, Dahl Inc., a nationally \nknown class-administration firm with significant experience. The Court recognizes and \napproves content of the Affidavit provided by Dahl, Inc. regarding the notice attached as \nExhibit 1 to the Memorandum in Support of the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class \nAction Settlement.  \n3.  The Court finds that there were no opt-outs or objections to this settlement.  \n4.  The Court finds that all material aspects of Class Notice were accomplished in \naccordance with this Court’s preliminary approval of the Settlement.  \n5.  The Class Representatives and Class Counsel have requested 37% of the  \nSettlement  fund  will  be  allocated  for  attorneys’  fees,  for  a  total  of  $  455,100.00  and \nDefendants and Defendants’ counsel do not object to the request. The Court further finds that \nlitigation and administration costs in the amount up to $45,000 shall be reimbursed to Class \nCounsel from the settlement fund. These amounts are reasonable given the nature of this case \nand the work of Class Counsel. This case is complex and involves questions of constitutional \nlaw and interpretation as well as issues of sovereign immunity and municipal liability. Class \nCounsel worked diligently on the case and moved it towards settlement as quickly as \npracticable. This was a result of aggressive, persistent litigation. Further, the benefits to the \nClass are significant. Finally, attorneys’ fees were approved by both Class  \nRepresentatives and Counsel and Defendants and Defendants’ Counsel do not object to the  \nRequest. There have been no objections by Class Members to the Request for Fees and Costs. \nBased on the above, the Court finds that the requested attorneys’ fees and costs are fair and \nreasonable and should be paid from the settlement.  \n   2  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 129   Filed 08/02/17   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 1871\n6.  The Court finds that the Class Representative payments of $15,000 each to \nClass Representatives Tabitha Gentry, Vincent Minton, Michael Herron, Adam Walker, Anna \nChastain, and Janelle South are fair and reasonable and should be paid from the settlement.  \n7.  Further, this Court hereby:        \na.  Finds that all things ordered by this Court in its Order Granting \nPreliminary  Approval  of  Class  Action  Settlement  have  been \naccomplished;  \n  \nb.  Finds that Class Counsel have fairly and adequately protected the \ninterests of the Settlement Class;  \n  \nc.  Finds that all requirements of statutes, rules, and the United States \nConstitution necessary to effectuate this Agreement have been met \nand satisfied;  \n  \nd.  Gives final approval to the Settlement Agreement as fair, reasonable, \nand adequate to the Class Members;  \n  \ne.  Approves  the award of  Class Counsel’s attorney fees  in  the amount    \nof $ 455,100.00 and litigation costs and fees of up to  $45,000, and \napproves Class  Representative  compensation  in  the  amount of \n$15,000  per  Class  Representative  pursuant  to  the  Settlement \nAgreement;  \n  \nf.  Recognizes  that  by  entering  into  the  Settlement  Agreement, \nDefendants have not admitted any wrongdoing or liability and deny \nthe  same.  The  Court  recognizes  that  the  Settlement  Agreement \nbetween the Parties is a compromise of disputed claims;  \n  \n   and  \n  \ng.  Recognizes  that  Class  Counsel  have  done  an  admirable  job  of \nrepresenting the interests of the Class; Class Representatives have \nrepresented the Class fairly and adequately, giving up their time to \nsecure relief that will benefit hundreds of people;  counsel  for  the  \nDefendants has provided excellent representation for his client; thus, \nfinal approval is in the best interest of the Parties and the Class.  \n  \nGood cause appearing therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n  \n   3  \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00054-TAB-RLY   Document 129   Filed 08/02/17   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 1872\n1.  The Settlement Agreement is given final approval as fair, reasonable, and \nadequate for the settlement of the claims of the Class Members.  \n2.  The Parties will comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement with the  \nterms of the Settlement being incorporated in this Order.  \n  \n3.

Before the court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  For the \nreasons that follow, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED. \n \n1 \n \n\nI.  Background \n  In 2010, the Floyd County Sheriff’s Department issued a policy statement entitled \n“Combative Subjects Practices.”  (Filing No. 49-3, Combative Subjects Policy).  As the \nname of the Policy suggests, the Policy covers the best practices for Floyd County Jail \nPersonnel to deal with “combative and potentially suicidal subjects” entering the Jail.  \n(Id.).  The Policy leaves the determination of who falls within the Policy to the discretion \nof Jail Personnel, and grants them the authority to take unruly detainees to a padded cell, \nstrip them of their clothes, and replace their clothes with a “protective smock.”  (Id.).  In \ndetermining whether a subject is unruly, the Policy instructs staff to use a “temperature \ntest”: \nSupervisors  or  medical  staff that  deem  a  subject  unstable  by  means  of \nintoxications [sic], general threating [sic] behavior, have the ability to take \neach incident and conduct a “temperature” test to decided [sic] what the best \ncourse of action is to protect all parties.  This “temperature” test to decided \n[sic]  what  the  best  course  of  action  is  to  protect  all  parties.    This \n“temperature”  test  includes  the  subject’s  demeanor,  attitude,  actions, \nintoxication, and a number of other officer observations that would allow \nhim to make this determination. \n(Id.).   \n  Subjects who fail the temperature test are placed into one of two padded isolation \ncells, referred to as “PD-1” and “PD-2.”  (Filing No. 44-1, Deposition of Lt. Andrew \nSands1 at 90-92).  These cells consist of four walls; there is no bench on which to sit.  \n(See Filing No. 52, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 5 (videotape of Plaintiffs in one of the cells)).  Once \n                                              \n1 The deposition of Lt. Sands is uploaded on the docket at Filing Nos. 44-1 and -2.  Hereinafter, \nhis deposition will be cited as “Sands Dep. at [page no.].” \n2 \n \n\ninside a padded cell, detainees are stripped of their clothing (sometimes forcibly) and \ngiven a one-size-fits-all protective (i.e., suicide prevention) smock.  In addition, they are \ndeprived of mattresses, blankets, and personal hygiene products because, according to Lt. \nAndrew Sands, such items can be used as weapons.  (Sands Dep. at 125-29; see also id. \nat 230 (“Q: So anytime someone refuses orders, you view them as a threat to use their \nclothing as a weapon against officers?  A:  Among other reasons, yes.”)).  Detainees \nremain in the padded cell until Jail Personnel determine, in their judgment, that the \ndetainees will behave.  (Id. at 103-04 (testifying that “if an inmate was a behavioral \nproblem, we may tell them, “Okay.  Let’s reevaluate this in a couple hours [until] you can \nprove to us that you’re going to follow our rules and be respectful . . . .”)). \n  The Plaintiffs herein were not placed in a padded cell because of a risk of suicide.  \nInstead, Plaintiffs were placed (sometimes forcibly carried) in a padded cell because they \nfailed the temperature test by engaging in bad behavior during the booking process, such \nas engaging in verbal arguments with Jail Personnel.  (See, e.g., Filing No. 1, Compl. ¶ \n47).  In addition to being stripped of their clothing, Plaintiffs allege they were treated \nwithout dignity or respect.  Some had to urinate in a floor drain (Id. ¶¶ 62, 75, 84, 106, \n122, 136); some were denied their medications (id. ¶¶ 110, 132); some were pepper \nsprayed (id. ¶¶ 56, 115); and some were hit with a taser (id. ¶¶ 72, 101).   \n  Plaintiffs allege that the Jail’s Policy and unwritten practice of “stripping out”2 \nunruly subjects violates the Fourth Amendment’s right to privacy and prohibition against \n                                              \n2 Sgt. Ryan Rainey testified that the term “stripping out” is “just a short form of saying they went \nto a padded cell.”  (Filing No. 46, Deposition of Ryan Rainey at 26).  \n3 \n \n\nexcessive force; the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual \npunishment; and the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to substantive and procedural due \nprocess.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the following class for liability issues only pursuant to \nRule 23(c)(4): \nAll inmates confined from June 12, 2013 to present in the Floyd County Jail \nwho were not on a suicide watch, but were housed in a padded cell where \nthey were deprived of clothing, bedding, and hygiene products. \n \nIn addition, Plaintiff’s propose the following subclass: \nThose class members who were subjected to weapons deployment while \nconfined and secured in the padded cells. \n \nII.  Rule 23 Requirements \n \nClass action suits are governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  A party \nseeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that certification is \nappropriate.  Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 596 (7th Cir. \n1993).  The decision whether to grant or deny a motion for class certification lies within \nthe broad discretion of the trial court.  Id.   \nRule 23 prescribes a two-step analysis to determine whether class certification is \nappropriate.  First, a plaintiff must satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a): (1) \nnumerosity; (2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation.  Clark v. \nExperian Info. Sols., Inc., 256 Fed. Appx. 818, 821 (7th Cir. 2007); Williams v. Chartwell \nFin. Serv., Ltd., 204 F.3d 748, 760 (7th Cir. 2000).  The failure to meet any one of these \nrequirements precludes certification of a class.  Retired Chicago Police Ass’n, 7 F.3d at \n596.  Second, the action must also satisfy one of the conditions of Rule 23(b).  Clark, 256 \n4 \n \n\nFed. Appx. at 821; Williams, 204 F.3d at 760.  Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule \n23(b)(3), which permits class certification if “questions of law or fact common to class \nmembers predominate over any questions affecting only individual members” and class \nresolution is “superior to other available methods for failure and efficiently adjudicating \nthe controversy.”    \nDefendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motion on several grounds.  First, Defendants argue \nthe class is not readily identifiable because determining whether one is a member of the \nclass requires an individualized factual inquiry.  Second, Defendants argue Plaintiffs \ncannot establish any of the factors listed in Rule 23(a) or (b).  The court will address each \nof these arguments in turn below. \nA.  Identifiable Class \nBefore reaching the Rule 23 requirements, the court must first determine whether \n“the class is indeed identifiable.”  Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th Cir. \n2006).  A class is identifiable if class membership can be readily obtained by reference to \nobjective criteria.  Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public Schools, 668 F.3d 481, 496 (7th Cir. \n2012).  If class membership can only be determined by individualized fact-finding or \n“mini-trials,” then a class action is inappropriate.  In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust \nLit., 299 F.R.D. 555, 567 (E.D. Tenn. 2014); see also Bledsoe v. Combs, No. NA 99-153-\nC H/G, 2000 WL 681094, at *4 (S.D. Ind. March 14, 2000) (finding proposed class \naction unmanageable where court could not determine whether one was a member of the \nclass “without hearing evidence on what would amount to the merits of each person’s \nclaim”).  Defendants argue the class is not readily identifiable because class membership \n5 \n \n\ndepends on whether each class member was (1) not on suicide watch and (2) housed in a \npadded cell where he/she was deprived of bedding, clothing, and hygiene products.  \nThus, a class member who was housed in a padded cell but received bedding would not \nbe a member of the class.   \nAs Plaintiffs note, the Behavior Watch Forms maintained by the Jail for those \ntaken to the padded cells clearly indicate who was on suicide watch and who was on \n“behavior watch.”  (See Filing Nos. 49-5, 49-8, 49-10, 49-11).  Plaintiffs were not on \nsuicide watch during their time in the padded cells.  (Sands Dep. at 270-80).  \nFurthermore, Lt. Sands testified that those inmates who were stripped of their clothing \nwere never given bedding and hygiene products as a matter of course.  (Id. at 125 (“Q: \nDo the inmates there being held naked except for a smock receive any mattress or \nbedding of any type? A: No.”)).  Class members are determined simply from their \npresence in the cell for reasons other than suicide prevention.  The court therefore finds \nthe class is sufficiently definite to permit class certification. \nB.  Rule 23(a) Factors \n  1.  Numerosity \nTo meet the numerosity requirement, the class must be so large “that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997) \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)).  “Generally, where the membership of the proposed class is \nat least 40, joinder is impracticable and the numerosity requirement is met.”  Morris v. \nRisk Mgmt. Alts., Inc., 203 F.R.D. 336, 342 (N.D. Ill. 2001).   \n6 \n \n\nPlaintiffs represent that they have identified 162 inmates, in addition to class \nrepresentatives, who were deprived of their clothing, bedding, and hygiene products \nwhile held in the padded cells for “behavioral reasons.”  (Sands Dep. at 279-80 and Dep. \nEx. 26).  In addition, Plaintiffs received 25 additional Behavioral Watch Forms from \nDefendants since Lt. Sands’ deposition.  Although Plaintiffs’ proposed class easily \nexceeds 40, Defendants argue the Plaintiffs failed to establish that joinder of the 162-plus \ninmates would be impracticable.  The court is not persuaded; the sheer number of \npotential class members leads the court to conclude that joinder would be impracticable. \nAs for the subclass of inmates subjected to weapons deployment, Defendants \nargue Plaintiffs have offered no evidence to prove that a subclass is necessary.  Plaintiffs \nrepresent that over 25 inmates have been identified as having been pepper sprayed while \nconfined in one of the two padded cells.  (See Filing No. 66-1, sampling of four Incident \nReports).  As discovery continues, Plaintiffs believe additional members of the subclass \nwill be found.   \nAlthough numerosity is an important consideration in the Rule 23 analysis, the \ncourt may look to other factors when determining whether joinder is impracticable, \nincluding, inter alia: judicial economy arising from the avoidance of a multiplicity of \nlawsuits, the financial resources of the class members, the inconvenience of trying \nindividual suits, the size of each plaintiff’s claim, and factors relevant to the practicability \nof joining all class members.  Donovan v. St. Joseph Co. Sheriff, No. 3:11-cv-133-TLS, \n2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis 63847, at *6-7 (N.D. Ind. May 3, 2012) (citing 32B Am. Jur. 2d \nFederal Courts § 1608; 5 Moore’s Fed. Practice – Civil § 23.22[1][a] (3d ed. 2011)).  \n7 \n \n\nThese factors persuade the court that joinder of the 25-plus claims in the subclass would \nbe impracticable.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Printing Indus. of Metro. Wash., D.C., Inc., 92 \nF.R.D. 51, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“[A]s few as 25-30 class members should raise a \npresumption that joinder would be impracticable, and thus the class should be certified.”).  \nFrom the court’s standpoint, resolving the subclass members’ claims on an individual \nbasis would strain the court’s resources.  Furthermore, the class members are generally \ndisadvantaged financially and thus, do not have the means to prosecute individual \nlawsuits.  And finally, damages are limited; consequently, there would be little incentive \nto file individual claims.  For these reasons, the court finds the subclass meets the \nnumerosity requirement. \n  2.  Commonality \nTo meet the commonality requirement, there must be “questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).  “A common nucleus of operative fact is \nusually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).”  Keele v. \nWexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) (quoting Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, \n1018 (7th Cir. 1992)).  A common nucleus of operative fact exists where “defendants \nhave engaged in standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class.”  Id.  In \nWal-Mart v. Dukes, the Supreme Court explained: \n[The  plaintiffs’]  claims  must  depend  upon  a  common  contention  –  for \nexample,  the  assertion  of  discriminatory  bias  on  the  part  of  the  same \nsupervisor.  That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature \nthat it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination \nof its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \nof the claims in one stroke. \n \n8 \n \n\n131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011). \n  Plaintiffs liken their case to Flood v. Dominguez, 270 F.R.D. 413 (N.D. Ind. \n2010).  There, the plaintiffs challenged the Lake County Jail’s policy and practice of \nholding pretrial detainees who were just booked into the Jail in holding cells for more \nthan 24 hours as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. \nat 415.  The purpose of the holding cells was to detain arrestees while the Jail determined \nwhere they would be housed.  Id.  Each cell had a concrete floor, concrete benches \naround the perimeter, and a single toilet, but no mattress or bed.  Id.   \n  Plaintiffs sought to certify a class of detainees housed in the holding cells for more \nthan 24 hours.  Id.  In granting the motion, the district court found the Plaintiffs \nestablished the commonality requirement.  Id. at 418.  It reasoned: “Plaintiffs’ core \ncomplaint—that the Jail’s policy of keeping detainees in holding cells for over 24 hours \nwithout a mattress or bed is unconstitutional—is common to the entire class.”  Id.  The \ncourt rejected the defendant’s argument that the potential variation in damages defeated \ncommonality.  “[T]he Seventh Circuit has been clear that variations in damages will not \ndefeat class certification.”  Id. (citing Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 800-01 (7th Cir. \n2008)).  \n  Plaintiffs argue Flood is directly on point because “this case is marked by \ncommon constitutional violations caused by institution-wide practices officially \ncondoned by the jail administration.”  (Filing No. 56, Plaintiffs’ Memorandum at 40).  \nDefendants distinguish Flood because, unlike the policy or practice in Flood, “this case is \nall about individual circumstances.”  To drive their point home, Defendants rely upon \n9 \n \n\nSecreti v. PTS of Am., LLC, No. 3-13-1065, 2015 WL 3505146 (M.D. Tenn. June 3, \n2015).  The complaint in Secreti alleged PTS of America used excessive force against the \nplaintiff and other similarly situated inmates by placing them in full restraints for more \nthan 48 continuous hours.  Id. at *1.  The plaintiff also asserted PTS failed to provide \nprivate or adequate access to toilet facilities, failed to provide personal hygiene items, \nfailed to provide proper food and drink, deprived him of access to prescribed medication \nand medical staff, and deprived him of adequate sleep and exercise during transport, in \nviolation of the plaintiff’s and the class’s Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights.  Id.  The plaintiff moved for class certification, defining the class as follows: \n[A]ll inmates including, without limitation, adults and juveniles, males and \nfemales,  pretrial  detainees,  sentenced  prisoners,  state  mental  hospital \ninmates,  and  immigration  detainees  who  were  transported  by  PTS  of \nAmerica, LLC and/or its agents or employees on behalf of local or state \ngovernments,  or  the  federal  government,  since  September  30,  2012 \nrestrained for more than 48 continuous hours. \n \nId.   \n  In analyzing plaintiff’s claim the district court observed, “Before the Court can \ndetermine whether a class member’s constitutional rights have been violated by such a \npolicy, practice or custom, it must balance any alleged policy, custom or practice of \nDefendant against legitimate penological justification for such policy and must uphold \nany such policy if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Id. at *3 \n(citing Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 132 S.Ct. 1510, 1515 (2012)).  Applying \nthe Florence balancing test to the plaintiff’s proposed class, the court denied the \nplaintiff’s motion.  Specifically with regard to the commonality requirement, the court \n10 \n \n\nfound that the balance of interests would differ based on the status of the inmates—i.e., \nthe difference between a pre-trial detainee and a convicted prisoner—and would require \nthe court to balance the interests as to each individual and not the class as a whole.  Id.  \nThe court further found that the defendant could also assert different defenses as to each \ninmate, based upon the inmate’s particular circumstances.  Id.  Accordingly, because the \ncourt could not resolve the issue central to the validity of each one of the class claims in \none stroke, the court found the plaintiff failed to satisfy the commonality requirement of \nRule 23.  Id. at *4. \n  Defendants argue Plaintiffs cannot establish commonality for the same reasons the \nplaintiff in Secreti could not establish commonality.  They explain:  “The balancing \nnature of the inquiry of whether the Defendants’ actions served a legitimate penological \ninterest would depend on the facts and circumstances of each Plaintiffs’ interaction with \nthe Defendants’ officers.”  (Filing No. 61, Defendants’ Response at 44).  They further \npoint out the proposed class contains both pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners.  \nThey maintain this difference in inmate status is enough to defeat the commonality \nrequirement.   \n  The court finds Plaintiffs’ case is more akin to Flood than Secreti.  Plaintiffs do \nnot challenge the reasons for their placement in a padded cell.  Rather, they challenge the \nconditions of their confinement in the padded cell—no clothing (but a smock), no \nbedding or hygiene products—as punitive and out of balance with any legitimate \npenological interest.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537 (1979) (“[P]unitive measures \n. . . may not constitutionally be imposed prior to a determination of guilt.”).  This inquiry \n11 \n \n\ndoes not depend on any individualized determination.  In sum, Plaintiffs’ core \ncomplaint—where Defendants’ “stripped out” policy or practice is unconstitutionally \npunitive—is common to the entire class.  Blihovde v. St. Croix Co., Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607, \n616 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (“[A] single common issue is sufficient to satisfy [the \ncommonality] requirement.”).   \n  The court further finds that the proposed class may consist of both pre-trial \ndetainees and convicted prisoners.  Although conditions of confinement claims are \nbrought under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and convicted \nprisoner’s claims are brought under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual \nPunishment Clause, the Seventh Circuit “appl[ies] the same standard to claims arising \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment (detainees) and Eighth Amendment (convicted \nprisoners) ‘without differentiation.’”  Board v. Farnham, Jr., 394 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir. \n2005) (quoting Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 845 n.2 (7th Cir. 1999)); see also \nLewis v. Downey, 581 F.3d 467, 475 (7th Cir. 2009) (“[A]nything that would violate the \nEighth Amendment would also violate the Fourteenth Amendment.”).  Thus, the fact that \nthe class contains both pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners is not an impediment to \ncertification, as each member of the putative class will have to prove the same facts and \nthe same legal theories to prevail on his or her claim.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs seek \ncertification for liability purposes only, leaving the class members’ individual damages \ndetermination for another day.  Flood, 270 F.R.D. at 418 (“Each class member must \nprove that the Jail’s policies and widespread practices caused the unconstitutional \n12 \n \n\nconditions of confinement in the holding cells.” (citing Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., \n436 U.S. 658 (1978))).   \n    3.  Typicality \n  The next issue concerns whether the claims of the class representative are typical \nof the class as a whole.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  A claim is typical of the class if “it \narises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of \nother class members and his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.”  Keele, \n149 F.3d at 595 (citation and internal quotation omitted).  Typicality and commonality \nare closely related; typicality, however, focuses on the relationship between the class \nrepresentative and the class as a whole.  De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 \nF.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983).  Typicality is important because the class representative, in \npursuing his or her own claims, is also advancing the interests of the class.  In re General \nMotors Corp. Dex-Cool Prods. Liab. Litig., 241 F.R.D. 305, 312 (7th Cir. 2007).    \n  Defendants argue the Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the class because each \nclaim depends upon the individualized interaction each plaintiff or proposed class \nmember had with Jail Personnel.  In other words, they argue, Plaintiffs’ pursuit of their \nown individual claims will not advance the interests of the proposed class.  The court \ndoes not agree.  “[S]imilarity in legal theory may control even in the face of differences \nof fact.”  Id.  Here, Plaintiffs challenge the same jail policy and practice and will rely on \nthe same legal theories to prove their claim as the proposed class.  Plaintiffs have met the \ntypicality requirement. \n \n13 \n \n\n \n    4.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The final requirement of Rule 23 is that “the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  To be an adequate \nrepresentative of a class, a plaintiff (1) must have a sufficient stake in the outcome to \nensure zealous advocacy; (2) must not have antagonistic or conflicting claims with other \nclass members; and (3) must have counsel who are experienced, qualified, and generally \nable to conduct the litigation.  Harris v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., No. 2008 WL 400862, \nat *7 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (citing Retired Chicago Police Ass’n, 7 F.3d at 594).    \n  Defendants do not challenge the qualification of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Instead, they \nargue there is the potential for conflicts among the Plaintiffs proposed as class \nrepresentatives.  They cite as an example class representative Adam Walker, who, \naccording to the Complaint, was tased seven times.  (Compl. ¶ 101).  They argue: \n“Walker’s presentation of that claim, among other claims, could make the pursuit of all \nelements of his claim antagonistic to the claim of the inmate who spent two hours in the \npadded cell.”  (Defendants’ Response at 51).  The court fails to see the conflict here.  \nWalker’s damages may be more, but both Walker and the class member would be subject \nto the same “stripped out” policy. \n  C.  Rule 23(b) Factors \n  In addition to meeting the class certification requirements under Rule 23(a), \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class must also satisfy the requirements of one of the three \nsubsections of Rule 23(b).  Here, Plaintiffs propose that certification is appropriate under \n14 \n \n\nRule 23(b)(3), which requires that: (1) questions of law or fact common to the members \nof the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members; and (2) a \nclass is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n    1.  Predominance \n  Under the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), common questions of law \nor fact must predominate; in other words, “there must be a common nucleus of operative \nfacts applicable to the entire class.”  Ziemack v. Centel Corp., 163 F.R.D. 530, 535-36 \n(N.D. Ill. 1995).   \n  Defendants argue the issues in this case are too individualized and fact-sensitive to \nallow class certification, particularly where, as here, multiple Defendants are sued in their \nindividual and official capacities.  Plaintiffs reiterate that they seek certification on the \nissue of liability— i.e., whether Defendants’ “stripped out” policy or practice violates the \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights by depriving them of basic human necessities.  Thus, the \nissues of concern to Defendants, such as individual damages and the defense of qualified \nimmunity, will be considered (assuming liability is found) in separate and individualized \nproceedings.   \n  The court agrees with the Plaintiffs.  “‘Courts routinely address conditions of \nconfinement claims in class actions.’”  Flood, 270 F.R.D. at 420 (quoting Dunn v. City of \nChicago, 231 F.R.D. 367, 377 (N.D. Ill. 2005)).  This is especially true where, as here, \nthe conditions stem from jail policies or practices that are uniformly applied to all \ninmates.  Id.  The court therefore finds that, notwithstanding any individual damages \n15 \n \n\ndeterminations, the constitutionality of the Defendants’ “stripped out” policy and practice \nwill be the predominate factor in determining liability.  Flood v. Dominguez, No. 2:08 \nCV 153 PPS PRC, 2011 WL 238265, at *3 (N.D. Ind. Jan. 21, 2011) (certifying the class \ndespite individualized nature of the injuries).   \n    2.  Superiority \n  Under Rule 23(b)(3), a class action must also be superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  Considerations \nrelevant to the superiority of a class action over individual lawsuits include:  \n(A) the class members’ interest in individually controlling the prosecution or \ndefense  of  separate  actions;  (B)  the  extent  and  nature  of  any  litigation \nconcerning the controversy already begun by or against members of the class; \n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the \nclaims in the particular forum; (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class \naction.  \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Defendants argue a class action lacks practical utility because \nthe court will have to conduct separate hearings to determine each class member’s \ndamages.  The court is not persuaded by this argument.  Because common issues do \npredominate, resolution of those common claims is more efficient than multiple \nindividual actions dealing with those claims.  Also, because many potential class \nmembers would likely recover little damages, they are unlikely to prosecute individual \nclaims absent the cost-sharing efficiencies offered by a class action.  The court therefore \nfinds that a class action is a superior method of litigating this case. \n \n \n16 \n \n\nIII. Conclusion\nThe court finds the proposed class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \n(Filing No. 49) is GRANTED. \nSO ORDERED this 16th day of February 2016. \nDistributed Electronically to Registered Counsel of Record. \n17 ",
