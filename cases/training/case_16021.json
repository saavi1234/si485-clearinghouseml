The family has not returned to the shelter since. Thus, DSS has been obligated to discharge them from the shelter and cancel J.C.'s transportation services for next week when school re−opens from the Sprink break. The family's whereabouts are currently unknown to DSS or this office. Accordingly, notwithstanding the agreement reached by the parties in Court on 3/31/04, there will be no transportation services available to J.C. next week should the family return to the school district or to a DSS homeless shelter. William Floyd can no longer guarantee that J.C.'s placement at the special education program will remain open indefinately. As Your Honor is aware, placement of a student in an out−of−district special education program occurs at great cost to the school district. (Coleman, Laurie) (Entered: 06/18/2004)"

Also before the court is the pltffs' letter application, seeking on behalf of the parties in the action, guidance in scheduling the depositions. The thirty−four deposition notices served upon the dfts without leave of the court are stricken. In light of the nature of this case and given the expedited discovery schedule each side may conduct up to 25 depositions. Pltffs may conduct depositions consistent with this order. As to the merits of the dft's motion to compel Ms. Julianelle to appear in person for her deposition, it is clear that the court may, upon motion, order that a deposition be taken by telephone. The dfts may either collectively contribute to the reasonable cost of producing Ms. Julianelle in this district or she may appear by telephone. The pltffs are reminded that if Ms. Julianelle appears by telephone, such depositions must also comply with Rule 28(b). Given the court's ruling with respect to the thirty−four notices of depositions, the pltffs' letter application seeking guidance in scheduling the depositions is moot. (See Order for further details). (Signed by Judge Arlene R. Lindsay, on 6/10/04). C/F(Coleman, Laurie) Modified on 8/12/2004 (Coleman, Laurie). (Entered: 08/11/2004)"

    "summary": "<p>The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty represented the Plaintiffs, homeless children and their parents living in Suffolk County. The Plaintiffs alleged that they were denied or deprived of access to a free and appropriate public school education and that the Defendants had violated the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11431-11435; New York Education Law § 3209; and other applicable laws and regulations promulgated thereunder. They also alleged that the Defendants deprived the Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights secured by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and by the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Plaintiffs brought the action on behalf of two Plaintiff classes, a children class and a parent class.</p><p>On February 20, 2004, the Plaintiffs filed suit against the following Defendants: the State Defendants (the New York State Education Department (“NYSED”), its employees, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (“OTDA”)); the County Defendants (Suffolk County Department of Social Services (“SCDSS”) and its employees); and the School District Defendants (fourteen districts were named, and the Plaintiffs also listed John Doe School Districts 1-10 to represent additional still-unnamed school districts who allegedly committed similar violations of laws and regulations).</p><p>The Plaintiffs alleged that homeless children in Suffolk County were often turned away at the schoolhouse door, experienced significant delays in enrolling in public school, or were denied access to transportation or other basic services that formed the basic prerequisite for them to receive a public school education. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief asking the court to enter an order (a) declaring that the Defendants were in violation of the aforementioned statutes and the laws and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (b) requiring the Defendants to comply promptly with all such laws and regulations and do so on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Many of the Plaintiffs spent each night of the week in a different location, or moved from place to place seeking temporary shelter. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants failed to take steps to ensure that children remained in their schools of origin if possible, nor did they assist families to ensure that the children received consistent, uninterrupted transportation to enable them to attend the schools designated for them by their parents. The Plaintiffs alleged that it took five days, sometimes longer, to obtain transportation to get children back to school after moving. Some Plaintiffs also allege that they were forced multiple times to transfer to different school districts during the school year. These children allegedly missed school because the School District Defendants insisted on enrollment paperwork – documentation of residency and immunization records – and refused to enroll them, without informing the Plaintiffs that they had the right to register children for school regardless of ability to provide this paperwork. </p><p>At the relevant time, SCDSS’ policy required that, to request emergency housing, all members of a homeless family, including school-aged children and employed adults, had to appear at one of its centers to be screened and to await placement. SCDSS’ policy required families wishing to be placed in emergency housing to return to their local center the next day with all members of the family to await placement again for that evening. This could involve waiting all day, and caused homeless children to miss school. </p><p>On October 23, 2004, Judge Arthur D. Spatt for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted class certification and denied the Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The classes were defined as follows: </p><p>Class A: All school-aged children (as defined by New York State Education Law) who, on or after September 1, 2001:(1) have lived, are living or will live in Suffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been, are, or will be “homeless” as defined in the McKinney–Vento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434A.</p><p>Class B: All parents, guardians or persons in a parental relationship for children in Class A, who, on or after September 1, 2001:(1) have lived, are living or will live in Suffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been, are, or will be “homeless” as defined in the McKinney–Vento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434A. 224 F.R.D. 314.</p><p>From the docket it is unclear when settlement discussions began, but on June 25, 2004, eleven of the School District Defendants and the Plaintiffs notified the court that they had agreed in principle to settle the case and requested that the court suspend all deadlines related to the School District Defendants. </p><p>On October 7, 2004, Judge Spatt approved the Plaintiffs’ and School District Defendants’ Settlement Agreement and Consent Order. The School District Defendants denied the Plaintiffs’ allegations, but nevertheless agreed to substantially comply with the terms, which involved (1) providing information to homeless children and families, (2) identification of homeless children, (3) transportation of homeless children, (4) coordination with the State Defendants and Social Services Defendants, (5) appeals and dispute resolution, (6) training of school personnel, (7) evaluation and assessment, (8) provision of Compliance Reports, at least semi-annually, by each School District Defendant, and (9) revision of any policies that served as barriers to the enrollment and retention of homeless children in school. The Plaintiffs waived their claims to attorneys’ fees or costs up until the date of the order, but reserved the right to seek them after the date should further litigation be required to enforce the provisions of the order. The order was effective for three years, and the case would be dismissed upon three years’ substantial compliance. </p><p>On March 31, 2006, Judge Spatt approved the Plaintiffs’ and State (OTDA and NYSED) Defendants’ Settlement Agreement and a Consent Order, and closed the case. The State Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiffs’ attorneys fees (in the amount of $378,291.33). The order obligated both the OTDA and NYSED to (1) collaborate with other Defendants, (2) revise any of their policies as necessary to comply with the Order, and (3) submit written Compliance Reports biannually for the first year and once annually thereafter. Additionally, the OTDA was required to (1) issue and/or revise administrative guidance to SCDSS and other social services agencies,   (2) monitor SCDSS’ provision of school transportation to homeless children and develop a Corrective Action Plan, if necessary and (2) provide training to SCDSS staff. The NYSED was also obligated to (1) revise its appeals process to eliminate barriers to appealing, (2) implement data collection and analysis initiatives, (3) monitor the fourteen School District Defendants and sixteen other districts with significant homeless populations (i.e., more than 25 homeless students at any one time), (4) enforce compliance within the school districts, and (5) train all school district or local social services agency personnel likely to have contact with homeless children and their families. The order was to remain in effect through and including October 1, 2008, when it would be dismissed upon substantial compliance.</p><p>Also on March 31, 2006, Judge Spatt approved the Plaintiffs’ and County (SCDSS and its employees) Defendants’ Settlement Agreement and Consent Order. The Defendants denied wrongdoing, but the parties agree that the Plaintiffs would receive attorneys’ fees (amount unspecified). The Order’s requirements for the County Defendants involved (1) providing information to homeless children and families, (2) making all reasonable efforts to provide homeless children with transportation to and from school, (3) discontinuing their policy of requiring homeless children to be physically present with their families to obtain emergency housing, (4) monitoring (to be conducted by OTDA and an SCDSS personnel member designated as a Compliance Officer) and data collection (5) coordinating with the other Defendants to ensure that homeless children enroll in and stay in school, (6) appeals and dispute resolution, (7) providing Compliance Reports semi-annually in the first year and once annually thereafter, and (8) revising any policies necessary to comply with the Order. The Order was to remain in effect through and including March 1, 2008, when it would be dismissed upon substantial compliance. </p><p>The case is now closed.</p>",

PROVIDING INFORMATION TO HOMELESS CIDLDREN AND FAMILIES \n7.  The parties agree that providing complete and timely information to homeless \nfamilies is essential to ensuring that homeless children and Unaccompanied Youth receive the \neducational services to which they are entitled under federal and state law.  Accordingly, the \nDefendants agree that they will take all reasonable measures to timely inform homeless families \nand Unaccompanied Youths of their right to receive services under the McKinney-Vento Act \n3 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 5 of 26\nand/or New York Education Law§ 3209, and will provide accurate and complete information to \nthose children and their families  about their rights and options to  enable them to  obtain the \nservices they need and/or desire.

The SCDSS Defendants shall ensure that the poster or posters referenced above \nare prominently and permanently displayed in each location in each shelter and in the waiting \nroom of each administration building where parents and guardians discuss or document travel \narrangements for students.  SCDSS will also request that hotels and motels in which homeless \nfamilies in SCDSS care are housed display the poster or posters in appropriate places within the \nhotel or motel. \n4 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 6 of 26\n10.  In addition, the SCDSS Defendants shall agree to distribute, as set forth below, \nany informational brochures or materials prepared by the State Defendants concerning the rights \nof students or parents under the McKinney-Vento Act and/or New York Education Law§ 3209. \nThe SCDSS Defendants shall request from the State Defendants and maintain a supply of any \nsuch brochures (in English and Spanish and such other languages as the State Defendants or \nNYS-TEACHS or a similar state or local contractor provides) at each shelter at which SCDSS \nplaces homeless families in a quantity sufficient to supply each homeless family.  SCDSS shall \nalso provide a supply of such brochures to each hotel or motel in which SCDSS places homeless \nfamilies.  No  later  than May  30,  2005,  and  once  each  school  year  thereafter,  the  SCDSS \nDefendants shall distribute a copy of any such brochure to each identified homeless family. \n11.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall ensure  that the  Brochures referenced above  are \ndistributed to homeless families when they first request housing or services from SCDSS, and \nare also provided to homeless families by shelter workers at the shelters where SCDSS places \nhomeless families. \n12.  The SCDSS Defendants shall coordinate efforts to ensure that the family of each \nsuch child receives the Brochure at the point at which they are first identified as homeless, that it \nbecomes a part of the SCDSS \"intake forms\" that homeless families receive when they lack (or \nare in danger of losing) permanent housing, and that it is in the native language of the family, \nwhere available, or in English, if not. \n13.  The SCDSS Defendants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that homeless \nfamilies placed in motels are informed of their rights as to the education of homeless children as \npromptly  as  possible  by  case  workers  or  other  SCDSS  staff that  provide  services  to  such \nfamilies. \n5 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 7 of 26\nTraining ofS  helter and SCDSS Personnel \n14.  The  parties  agree  that  providing  appropriate  services  to  homeless  children \nrequires  that  personnel  at  SCDSS  and  others  involved  in  transporting  homeless  children \nunderstand the rights and needs of homeless children and have sufficient knowledge of homeless \nchildren's rights and needs to be able to help them.  Accordingly, the SCDSS Defendants agree \nthat  they,  in  coordination  and  conjunction  with  OTDA  and  NYS-TEACHS,  will  provide \nappropriate and reasonable training to all personnel who are likely to have contact with homeless \nchildren or their families concerning homeless children's education. \n15.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  cooperate  fully  with  all  trainings  provided, \nmandated, or sponsored by OTDA that pertain to the transportation of homeless children to and \nfrom  school.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  ensure  that  all  personnel  involved  in  the \ntransportation of homeless children will attend such trainings. \n16.  To  the  extent  that  OTDA  does  not  provide  to  SCDSS  personnel  training \nconcerning the transportation of homeless children to  and from school, SCDSS shall train its \npersonnel as set forth in this paragraph:  At least twice each school year, the SCDSS Defendants \nshall require appropriate  staff from  shelters (including,  without limitation, domestic violence \nprograms  and  programs  for  Unaccompanied  Youth),  and  SCDSS  staff  involved  in  the \ntransportation  of homeless  children  to  and  from  school,  to  attend  training  on the  rights  of \nhomeless children.  This training will  include the  proper use  of forms  needed to  implement \ntransportation, the time frames for completion of the forms and transmitting them to the SCDSS \nDefendants, the tracking requirements specified by OTDA, the role of shelter staff or SCDSS \npersonnel in providing information to homeless families and assisting them in obtaining school \ntransportation and coordinating with school and social services personnel to ensure that delays in \nimplementing transportation are kept to a minimum.  In addition, SCDSS will provide training to \n6 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 8 of 26\nnew shelter workers and new SCDSS staff involved in transportation of homeless children to and \nfrom  school on a monthly basis to ensure that all persons involved in providing services for \nhomeless children are aware of their responsibilities. \n17.  The SCDSS  Defendants  shall maintain a complete and accurate record of the \nidentity of all SCDSS personnel who received training, the dates of the training, and copies of \nany materials used or distributed at the training.  The SCDSS Defendants shall further document \nany  relevant  personnel  who  did  not  receive  the  training,  and  shall  make  the  necessary \narrangements to have such personnel receive the training on the earliest practicable occasion. \n18.  The SCDSS Defendants shall make the trainings referred to  above available to \nany  third  party  transportation  companies  that  provide  transportation  services  for  homeless \nchildren receiving housing from  SCDSS.  The  SCDSS  Defendants shall encourage any such \nthird-party transportation companies to attend such trainings. \n19.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  ensure  that  relevant  SCDSS  and/or  shelter \npersonnel attend such trainings as OTDA may require. \n20.  To the extent that the SCDSS Defendants employ a training curriculum other than \nor in addition to that provided by OTDA or other State agencies with respect to the trainings \nreferred to or required herein, the SCDSS Defendants shall include the following in any such \nother training curriculum: (i) the causes and effects of homelessness; (ii) the educational and \nother needs of homeless children; (iii) the rights of homeless children and obligations of the \nschool  districts  under the McKinney-Vento  Act,  New York Education  Law  § 3209 and any \nregulations thereunder; (iv) the proper use of the various forms for identifying and providing \nservices  to  homeless  children;  (v)  the  nature  and  scope  of services  available  for  homeless \nchildren, both within and without the school district; (vi) the identification of homeless children; \n7 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 9 of 26\n(vii) the  importance of a mechanism for  coordinating with SCDSS concerning the needs of \nhomeless  children;  (viii)  the  particular  educational,  social  and  emotional  difficulties  and \nchallenges faced by homeless children; (ix) the definition ofhomelessness; and (x) the particular \nneeds of Unaccompanied Youth. \n21.  The  training  curriculum  and/or  summary  materials  will  be  provided  to  all \nemployees  who  attend  the  trainings.  All  new  hires  involved  in  school  transportation  for \nhomeless children will receive copies of such materials as part of their employee orientation \nmaterials. \n22.  The provider of the above-referenced training curriculum and in-service program \nshall be specially trained in and knowledgeable about the curriculum and shall be effective at \ncommunicating  and teaching  the  required  material.  The  training  curriculum  and  in-service \nprogram will use appropriate handouts, slides or other visual aids to maximize the pedagogic \nimpact of the program. \n23.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  provide  Plaintiffs'  counsel  with a copy  of any \ntraining curriculum and in-service program in advance for review and comments.  The parties \nshall work in good faith to discuss any comments or concerns about the training curriculum and \nin-service program. \n24.  Counsel  for  the  SCDSS  Defendants  and  Plaintiffs  shall  confer  to  determine \nappropriate  venues  for  providing  information  to  homeless  families  about  the  education  of \nhomeless children. \nIll.  TRANSPORTATION OF HOMELESS CHILDREN \n25.  The parties to this Consent Order acknowledge and agree that transportation poses \na particular difficulty for homeless families and is essential to ensuring that homeless children \n8 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 10 of 26\nreceive the educational services to which they are entitled.  As a result, the SCDSS Defendants \nagree that they will make all reasonable efforts, consistent with this Consent Order, to ensure that \nhomeless children receive transportation to and from school (and/or any preschool services for \nspecial education students or after or before school activities to which non-homeless children are \nprovided transportation) each day. \nEmergency Services Housing \n26.  The SCDSS Defendants shall immediately discontinue any policy or practice that \nrequires homeless children to be physically present with their families after the first 24 hours of \ninitial emergency placement in order for the families to obtain Emergency Services housing. \n27.  The SCDSS Defendants agree that homeless families will spend no more than two \nbusiness  days  in Emergency  Services housing  placements,  after  which  time  such  homeless \nfamilies will be assigned to a shelter or equivalent longer-term emergency housing placement. \nThe  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  amend  their  rules,  policies  and/or  procedures  to  reflect  the \nforegoing. \n28.  If SCDSS is unable to arrange for a shelter or other emergency placement outside \nof  Emergency  Services  housing  after  two  business  days,  SCDSS  shall  provide  school \ntransportation for any affected homeless children by van, taxi or other means for each day that \nthe child remains in Emergency Services housing and until such time as the child receives both a \nstable shelter or other emergency housing placement and regular bus transportation between such \nplacement and school. \n29.  If SCDSS  requires  a parent or guardian to  accompany  a child to  school, the \nSCDSS  Defendants  shall  ensure  that  such parent  or  guardian is  excused from  any  SCDSS \nattendance or other requirements that the parent or guardian is  likely to  miss  as  a result of \naccompanying a child to school and the SCDSS Defendants shall notify any other appropriate \n9 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 11 of 26\nagencies whose policies or requirements may be affected by the need of a parent or guardian to \naccompany a homeless child to or from school. \nSchool Transportation Following Initial Longer Term Emergency Housing Placement \n30.  Upon a homeless child's placement by the  SCDSS  Defendants in a shelter or \nother stable emergency housing location,  if a bus route or other reliable  and  safe means  of \ntransportation to the child's chosen school district is already in place, the child may begin taking \nthat bus or other means of transportation on the first school day following his/her arrival at the \nshelter. \n31.  If, on a homeless child's first placement by SCDSS in a shelter or other stable \nemergency housing location (including shelters or motels), no bus route already exists to that \nchild's chosen school district, the SCDSS Defendants shall have three (3) business days from the \nchild's arrival at the shelter in which to arrange regular, continuous school bus transportation. \nThus, by way of example only, if a homeless child is first placed by SCDSS in a shelter on \nMonday and there is no existing bus route available for that child, SCDSS shall arrange school \nbus transportation for that child no later than Thursday morning. \n32.  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if a homeless child has already missed \nschool as a result of being placed in Emergency Services housing, such child shall be provided \ntransportation starting with the third day after the child's arrival in the SCDSS system.  The \nSCDSS  Defendants may use vans or taxi  services to  accomplish this transport until regular, \ncontinuous bus transportation is arranged.  Thus, by way of example, if a homeless child arrives \nat an Emergency Services housing office on Monday, that child shall be provided transportation \nto school no later than Thursday, regardless of whether a bus route has been established for the \nchild at a subsequent stable shelter or other emergency housing placement. \n10 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 12 of 26\n33.  In order to expedite transportation for homeless children, the SCDSS Defendants \nshall require  shelter workers and SCDSS motel  case workers to  transmit necessary forms  to \narrange transportation immediately,  and in no  event later than the next business day  after a \nhomeless child's arrival at a shelter or stable housing placement.  If a homeless family refuses or \ndeclines to permit a STAC form to  be filled out,  SCDSS will be required to provide school \ntransportation for any children of such family as soon as possible thereafter as is reasonable \nunder the circumstances. \n34.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  transmit  to  any  third  party  contractors  of the \nSCDSS Defendants (including any bus companies or transportation management companies such \nas  GlobeGround  and  Suffolk  Transportation)  any  forms  necessary  to  arrange  school \ntransportation for homeless children on the same day such forms are received if the forms are \nreceived by the SCDSS Defendants by 1:00 p.m., and as soon as practicable the next morning the \nsuch forms are received after 1: 00 p.m.  The SCDSS Defendants shall ensure multiple pick-up \ntimes so that forms received in the late morning or afternoon are promptly transmitted to those \npersonnel establishing bus routes. \n35.  The SCDSS Defendants shall, in good faith, review the procedures and processes \nused  by  any  of their  third  party  transportation  contractors  to  determine  whether  there  are \nadditional ways in which delays or processing time for the transportation of homeless children \ncan be minimized or eliminated. \n36.  In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  SCDSS  shall  review  its  own  processes  and \npaperwork requirements to reduce any other delays or inefficiencies. \nSubsequent Transportation Changes \n3 7.  Once a homeless child has been placed in a long term shelter or other stable \nhousing placement, the SCDSS Defendants shall make reasonable efforts, consistent with their \n11 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 13 of 26\nother legal duties, to minimize any subsequent relocations of the child or disruption to the child's \neducation. \n38.  If the SCDSS Defendants decide to change a homeless child's housing placement \nfor  administrative  purposes,  or to  improve the housing or services  of a particular homeless \nfamily, or as part of changes in shelter or motel availability, or under circumstances where the \nSCDSS Defendants have advance warning of such a change or know of the need for such a move \nprior to 2:00 p.m. of the day of the move (a \"Planned Move\"), the  SCDSS Defendants shall \nimmediately begin making necessary arrangements for  school transportation for any affected \nchildren. \n39.  If the SCDSS Defendants move a homeless child as part of a Planned Move, the \nchild must not experience any significant gaps or delays in school transportation and the SCDSS \nDefendants shall provide transportation for any affected children the next school day after a \nPlanned Move,  at the  latest.  If the SCDSS Defendants are not able to pre-arrange regular, \ncontinuous and uninterrupted bus transportation by the next school day for  such children in \nadvance of a Planned Move, they will provide school transportation for the child by van, taxi or \nother means such that the child will receive school transportation commencing no later than the \nday after the Planned Move. \n40.  If the SCDSS Defendants move a homeless child as a result of unforeseen but \ncompelling circumstances (such as a major violation of shelter rules or SCDSS rules) or without \nadvance warning of a serious need to move a child and such move takes place after 2:00p.m. (an \n\"Unplanned Move\"), then the SCDSS Defendants shall arrange for regular, continuous safe and \nreliable transportation no later than the second business day after the Unplanned Move occurs. \nThus, by way of example, if a homeless child is unexpectedly moved on Monday evening for \n12 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 14 of 26\ncompelling and unforeseen reasons, the SCDSS Defendants shall provide that child with regular, \ncontinuous safe and reliable transportation no later than Wednesday morning. \n41.  If the  SCDSS  Defendants are not able to pre-arrange regular,  continuous bus \ntransportation for such a child by the second school day after an Unplanned Move, they will \nprovide school transportation for the child by van, taxi or other means beginning on the second \nschool day after the Unplanned Move. \n42.  Regardless of whether a move is a Planned Move or Unplanned Move, if SCDSS \nrequires a parent or guardian to accompany a child to school, the SCDSS Defendants shall ensure \nthat such parent or guardian shall be excused from any SCDSS attendance or other requirements \nthat the parent or guardian is likely to be unable to fulfill  as a result of accompanying a child to \nschool. \nMiscellaneous Transportation Issues \n43.  Notwithstanding  any  of the  foregoing  provisions  of this  Consent  Order,  the \nSCDSS Defendants shall make whatever transportation arrangements are necessary to ensure \nthat homeless children do not miss major examinations, including New York State assessment \ntests and Regents examinations, midterm examinations and final  examinations.  The SCDSS \n' \nDefendants shall, if necessary, provide a van or taxi service to homeless children for whom no \nregular bus service is yet available in order to ensure that such children are able to sit for such \nexaminations. \n44.  If the inability or failure of the SCDSS Defendants to arrange transportation has \nresulted in a  child missing school, the  SCDSS  Defendants shall inform the relevant school \ndistrict's homeless liaison and attendance officer of that fact.  Should any complaint be filed by \nany person or entity regarding the fact that the child has missed school, and the reason the child \nmissed school is the inability or failure of the SCDSS defendants to arrange transportation for \n13 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 15 of 26\nthat child, SCDSS  shall in writing immediately convey that fact to  Child Protective Services \nand/or the Department of Probation, including, if necessary, the child's probation officer, law \nguardian, or family court judge. \n45.  Absences from school of homeless children due to changes in housing placement, \nadministrative delays, unforeseen problems in transportation or other similar reasons shall not be \na basis for  any  action against the homeless child's family by the SCDSS Defendants or any \nshelter with which the SCDSS Defendants contract. \n46.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  provide transportation for  homeless children of \nfamilies  receiving  services  from  the  SCDSS  Defendants  to  any  institution providing public \neducational  services  to  the  child,  including  any  placement  indicated  on  such  a  child's \nindividualized education plan (IEP) or individualized family service plan (IFSP) where a school \ndistrict  would  normally  provide  transportation.  Such  transportation  shall  be  provided  in \naccordance with the time frames  set forth  above  and  subject to  the  same provisions of this \nConsent Order applicable to transportation of homeless children who are not receiving special \neducation services. \n47.  In selecting temporary housing arrangements for homeless families with school-\naged children, the SCDSS Defendants shall consider the effect of any proposed arrangement on \nthe  education of such children.  The SCDSS  Defendants shall place homeless families  with \nschool-aged children as close as possible to their school district of origin if so requested by the \nfamilies of such homeless children.  The SCDSS Defendants shall inform homeless families of \ntheir right to request housing in the school district of origin, if available and appropriate.  If the \nSCDSS Defendants do not place a homeless family in housing in the district of origin for such \n14 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 16 of 26\nfamily's school-aged children, the SCDSS Defendants shall document the reason or reasons why \nthe family was placed in a different district. \n48.  If the SCDSS Defendants are providing shelter to the homeless child's family and \ndo not provide transportation on certain school days for reasons beyond the control of the child's \nfamily, the SCDSS Defendants shall give written notice to the homeless liaison of the school \ndistrict that that child attends of the reason for the absence so as to avoid an unexcused absence \non the child's attendance record. \n49.  If a homeless child is out of school due to a lack of transportation while residing \nm  a  SCDSS  shelter  placement,  the  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  direct  shelter  staff and  motel \ncaseworkers to make reasonable efforts to contact the school district's homeless liaison and shall \ncoordinate with the homeless liaison a plan for the child to receive class notes, homework, and \nother school assignments. \n50.  In providing transportation for homeless children, the SCDSS Defendants shall, \nwhere requested by a parent or guardian of a homeless child, provide transportation to and from \nany after-school, before-school, preschool (in the case of special education children), summer \nschool or extracurricular activities or free meal programs for which transportation is provided by \nthe relevant school district for non-homeless children.  SCDSS will provide such transportation \nin  the  same  circumstances  (and  in  the  same  hours)  in  which  school  districts  provide \ntransportation.  Personnel of the SCDSS Defendants shall inform homeless families of their right \nto  such transportation,  and the  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  cooperate  with the relevant school \ndistrict as necessary to ensure that homeless children are receiving all appropriate educational \nservices. \nIS \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 17 of 26\n51.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs will provide to counsel for the SCDSS Defendants a list \nof SCDSS and shelter rules that the Plaintiffs believe should be amended to promote efficient \nschool transportation for homeless children.  The SCDSS Defendants agree to meet promptly \nwith the Plaintiffs to  discuss in good faith the list and possible amendments to SCDSS and \nshelter rules so as to promote school transportation for homeless children. \n52.  The SCDSS Defendants shall take reasonable and appropriate measures to reduce \nthe travel time of homeless children to and from school. \n53.  The SCDSS Defendants shall take all reasonable measures, consistent with this \nConsent Order, to avoid unnecessary disruption in the transportation of homeless children. \n54.  Where homeless children are placed in home instruction or suspension by their \nschool districts, the parents or guardians of such children shall not be found to be in violation of \nshelter, motel or SCDSS rules as a result of having to be present with their children during the \npendency of such home instruction or suspension. \n55.  In  negotiating  future  contracts  with  third-party  transportation  providers  for \nhomeless children, the SCDSS Defendants shall attempt to negotiate appropriate assurances and \nprotections against disruptions to school transportation for homeless children and shall ensure \nthat any such contracts are consistent with the requirements of this Consent Order and the goal of \nproviding continuous school transportation for homeless children as quickly as possible. \n56.  Any responses by the County Social Services Defendants to written inquiries or \ncomplaints by parents or guardians of homeless children as to transportation arrangements shall \nbe made in writing to the parent or guardian, with a copy retained in the case files maintained \nconcerning the families of those children.  Such documents will be made available to the New \nYork State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance upon request \n16 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 18 of 26\n57.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that homeless children are transported to \nand attend school as regularly as possible, and the provisions of this Consent Order should be \nconstrued accordingly. \nIV.  MONITORING AND DATA COLLECTION \n58.  Upon the receipt by the SCDSS Defendants of the forms necessary to arrange for \nschool transportation for a homeless child, including but not limited to the \"STAC Form\" and \nany  forms  for  use  by  GlobeGround  or  other  transportation  providers  (collectively,  the \n\"Transportation Forms\") from a shelter, motel or other case worker, SCDSS shall enter into a \nwritten log book the time and date of the receipt of such forms, the child seeking transportation \nand  the  shelter and  school  involved.  (This  log  will  be  referred  to  herein  as  the  \"SCDSS \nLogbook.\") \n59.  Each caseworker at a shelter, motel or other housing facility shall be required by \nSCDSS to maintain a written log of the time and date each homeless child enters the shelter, \nmotel  or housing  facility,  and  the  time  and  date  on which  the  Transportation Forms  were \ntransmitted to the SCDSS Defendants.  (This log will be referred to herein as the \"Shelter/Motel \nLogbook.\") \n60.  The  SCDSS  Defendants  shall  maintain  a  written  log,  or  reqwre  each \ntransportation  company  or  third  party  vendor  contracting  with  the  SCDSS  Defendants  to \nmaintain a written  log,  reflecting the time  and  date  on which each child placed in SCDSS \nreceived transportation services, including the name of the child, shelter and school involved. \n(This log will be referred to herein as the \"Transportation Logbook.\") \n17 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 151    Filed 03/31/06   Page 19 of 26\n61.

This  lawsuit seeks to  remedy the systemic failure  of the education and social \nservices systems in New York State and Suffolk County to provide homeless children within the \ncounty with access to a free, public education . \n• \n2.  Few  circumstances  are  more tragic  than those  faced  every day by homeless \nchildren.  Denying such children the same access to public school education enjoyed by other \n• \nchildren makes it all the more difficult for such children to integrate into society and realize their \npotential as human beings.  The Defendants-the persons and entities responsible for educating \nand providing social services to homeless children in Suffolk County, New York-have, by their \n• \nneglect or in some instances malfeasance, added to the tragedy of homeless children by denying \nthem appropriate access to a basic public school education. \n•  3.   The Plaintiffs in this case are homeless children and their parents living in Suffolk \nCounty who have been denied or are being denied or deprived of access to a free and appropriate \npublic school education because of the Defendants' violations of the requirements of federal and \n• \nstate  laws  and regulations.1  The  consequence  of the  Defendants'  conduct is  that homeless \nchildren in Suffolk County are often turned away at the schoolhouse door, experience significant \ndelays in enrolling in public school, or are denied access to transportation or other basic services \n• \nthat form the basic prerequisite for them to receive a public school education.  This lawsuit seeks \nto break the Defendants' pattern of neglect, indifference and intransigence towards the homeless \n• \n1  Plaintiffs are identifying themselves in this pleading and all other public documents filed in this case through \ninitials only.  Plaintiffs are minor children or parents of minor children, some of whom have been classified as \nhaving special educational needs.  Accordingly, the named plaintiffs have requested identification by initials only in \norder to protect their privacy rights and the privacy rights of their minor children pursuant to the Family Education \nRights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA''), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b), 34 C.F.R. § 99.30 (1988), and the Individuals with \n• \nDisabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq., 20 U.S.C. § 1417(c) (1988), 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.571, \n.572, .573. See also Webster Groves School Dist. v. Pulitzer Pub. Co., 898 F.2d 1371, 1374-75 (8th Cir. 1990). \n-2-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 3 of 51 PageID #: 3\nchildren of Suffolk County . \n• \n4.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  behalf of themselves  and  all  others  similarly \nsituated, challenging the failure of the Defendants to  comply with the Stewart B. McKinney-\n•  Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11431-11435 (the \"McKinney-Vento Act\"), New \nYork State Education Law § 3209 and the regulations promulgated thereunder and challenging \nDefendants'  repeated violations of Plaintiffs'  rights under the United  States  and New York \n• \nConstitutions . \n5.  Upon information and belief there  are numerous children in Suffolk County \nwho are denied or deprived of access to  the public school they are entitled to  attend simply \n• \nbecause they are homeless and because the Defendants, collectively and/or individually, have \nbeen responsible for a systemic failure to provide access to an education for homeless children in \n•  Suffolk County New York.  The root  cause  of this  situation is  the Defendants'  pursuit of \npractices and customs that, among other things, have resulted in a failure to: \na.  locate  and  ensure  enrollment  and  the  opportunity  for  educational  success  of \n•  homeless children in New York State and Suffolk County, New York; \nb.  provide adequate, uninterrupted transportation assistance sufficient to enable such \nchildren to attend school; \nc.  provide an opportunity for each homeless child to be immediately enrolled in the \n• \nschool that is  in his or her best interest to  attend while homeless-either the \nschool of origin or the school nearest to where he or she is actually living, without \nregard to standard documentation requirements; \nd.  provide parents of homeless children an opportunity to participate in determining \n•  the best interest of their children; \ne.  comply with the wishes of homeless parents as to choice of school to the extent \nfeasible; \nf.  implement a meaningful plan to remove systemic barriers to homeless children's \n• \nparticipation in public education; \n-3-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 4 of 51 PageID #: 4\ng.  provide appropriate notice to parents or children in Suffolk County, of a child's \n• \nlegal  right  to  remain  in  the  school  that  the  child attended when permanently \nhoused or the school in which the child was last enrolled (the \"school of origin\") \nafter becoming homeless; \nh.  afford homeless children and parents in Suffolk County appropriate notice of the \navailability of an ombudsperson and of their right to dispute school placement and \ntransportation decisions. \ni.  grant ombudspersons the  authority to  enforce their decisions  and requests  for \nschool districts to  admit homeless children to  school and/or provide homeless \nchildren  with  prompt,  adequate  and  uninterrupted  transportation  or  other \nnecessary services; \nj.  provide  for  prompt,  timely  and  effective  dispute  resolution  procedures  as  ts \nrequired by the McKinney-Vento Act; \n•  k.  coordinate emergency housing procedures and other social services requirements \nfor homeless families with the procedures and requirements for attending public \nschools; \nI.  provide  comparable  services,  including  transportation  services,  to  homeless \nchildren that are available to children who are not homeless; \n• \nm.  review and revise policies, including transportation policies, that act as a barrier to \nthe enrollment of homeless children in school; and \nn.  assess the special needs of homeless children and youth . \n• \n6.  As set forth more fully herein, Plaintiffs allege that these policies, practices and \ncustoms violate state and federal laws.  Plaintiffs therefore seek declaratory and injunctive relief \nand  ask  this  Court  to  enter  an  order  (a)  declaring  that  Defendants  are  in  violation  of the \nMcKinney-Vento Act (42 U.S.C.  §§  11431-11435), New York State Education Law  § 3209, \nother applicable laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and (b) requiring Defendants \n• \nto comply promptly with all such laws and regulations and to do so on an ongoing basis . \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), on the ground that \n• \nthis action arises under the laws of the United States.  This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to \n-4-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 5 of 51 PageID #: 5\nthe  Individual  with  Disabilities  Education Act  (\"IDEA\"),  20  U.S.C.  §§  1400-1487  and  the \n• \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S. C. § 794. \n8.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), on the ground \n•  that the violations of law described herein occurred in Suffolk County, New York, where the \nPlaintiffs reside. \n9.  Plaintiffs have been deprived of their federal statutory rights, and thus bring this \n• \naction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n10.  This  Court  has  supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to  28  U.S.C.  §  1367  over \nPlaintiffs'  claims  of violations  of New  York  State  Education  Law  and  the  New  York \nConstitution, Article XI, § 1. \n11.  There is an actual controversy between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants within \nthe meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 57. \nPARTIES \n•  M.K. and S.P . \n12.  M.K. is the mother and legal guardian ofS.P., a fifteen year old girl who, prior to \nbecoming homeless, attended Longwood High School.  M.K. and S.P. are both citizens of the \n• \nUnited States and at all times mentioned herein were and are living in Suffolk County. \n13.  At all relevant times, M.K. and S.P. have been homeless and have lacked a fixed, \nadequate and regular nighttime residence.  M.K. and S.P. have no permanent address and often \n• \nspend each night of the week in  a different  location, or move  from  place to  place seeking \ntemporary shelter.  M.K. and S.P. have been homeless since approximately December 5, 2003, \n• \nwhen  they were  evicted  from  their  permanent  residence  in  Ridge,  New  York,  within  the \n-5-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 6 of 51 PageID #: 6\nLongwood School District.  Following the  eviction, M.K.  and S.P.  have  lived in temporary \n• \nhousing and are presently dwelling on a temporary basis in a motel in Holbrook, New York. \n14.  At all  times mentioned herein,  Plaintiff S.P.  was enrolled in,  or sought to  be \n•  enrolled, in the Longwood School District. \n15.  On or about December 3, 2003, when M.K. and S.P. realized that they were about \nto become homeless, M.K. called the attendance office at Longwood High School to arrange for \n• \ntransportation for S.P. to and from their new temporary address.  The school officials refused to \nhelp and informed M.K.  that transportation was her problem, not that of the school or school \ndistrict . \n• \n16.  At the time M.K. and S.P. became homeless, S.P. was enrolled as a tenth grader in \nLongwood High School.  Because S.P. was diagnosed as having special needs, S.P. was placed \n• \nin a special education program . \n17.  M.K. does not own a car and is not able to drive.  Thus, following their eviction, \nM.K. was not able to transport S.P. to school.  M.K. made numerous telephone calls to various \n• \nschool officials over the next several weeks to arrange for transportation for S.P.  M.K.'s calls to \nthe school officials over the next several weeks went unanswered and the school district refused \n•  to provide any assistance to M.K. or S.P . \n18.  In later December, M.K. contacted New York State Technical and Educational \nAssistance Center for Homeless Students (\"NYS TEACHS\").  She was told, for the first time, \n• \nthat transportation for S.P. was the responsibility of the school system.  NYS TEACHS directed \nM.K. to the \"homeless liaison\" at the Longwood School District. \n19.  M.K. called the homeless liaison on several occasions but received no return call . \n• \nFinally, M.K.  spoke to a secretary for the homeless liaison who informed M.K. that only the \n-6-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 7 of 51 PageID #: 7\nDepartment of Social Services could help.  M.K. explained that DSS did not place M.K. and S.P . \n• \nin their temporary housing and thus would not provide transportation for them.  The secretary \nindicated that the homeless liaison would contact them soon.  The homeless liaison never called \n•  them, even though M.K. called her office several times thereafter . \n20.  M.K. 's repeated inquiries about transportation were never answered.  The only \ntime the school district contacted M.K. was to threaten \"consequences\" if S.P. did not resume her \n• \nattendance at school.  M.K. understood this threat to mean that they would attempt to remove \nS.P. from M.K.'s custody if M.K. was unable, on her own, to secure transportation for S.P. to \nschool. \n• \n21.  As  a result  of these  events,  S.P.  has  been  out  of school  continuously  since \napproximately November 26, 2003 and has received no educational or special education services \n• \nof any kind since that time . \n22.  M.K. brings this action on her own behalf, as next friend and legal guardian of \nS.P., and on behalf of a class of homeless parents and children located in Suffolk County, New \n• \nYork. \nR.I. and A.B. \n•  23.  R.I.  is  the mother and legal guardian of A.B.,  a sixteen year old girl who  is \npresently enrolled in Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Education Services (\"BOCES\").  R.I. \nand A.B. are citizens of the United States and at all times mentioned herein were and are living \nin Suffolk County. \n24.  At all relevant times, R.I. and A.B. have been homeless and have lacked a fixed, \nadequate and regular nighttime residence.

R.I. and A.B. became homeless in August 2002 after fleeing from a domestic \n• \nviolence situation. \n25.  Immediately after becoming homeless, R.I. and A.B. enrolled A.B. in the Middle \n•  Country School District.  R.I. and A.B. were re-housed by Suffolk County Department of Social \nServices (\"SCDSS\") every night for a considerable period of time.  They were finally placed in a \nstable motel placement, the Rainbow Motel in Copiague, New York, only after an administrative \n• \nFair Hearing was requested.  R.I.  and  A.B.  lived in the  Rainbow Motel in Copiague  from \napproximately October 2002 until March 2003. \n26.  Eventually, the Middle Country School District learned that A.B. was living in a \nmotel in the Copiague Union Free School District and advised R.I and A.B. that A.B. could not \nattend school in Middle Country, but would have to attend school in the Copiague district. \n• \n27 .  The Copiague School District, however, refused to enroll A.B. without receiving \nrecords from her prior schools.  No one at the school district or the SCDSS ever informed R.I. or \nA.B. that they had the right to have A.B. enrolled at and attending school regardless of whether \n• \nR.I. and A.B. were able to provide certain paperwork, such as immunization records, guardian \npapers, utility bills, and the like. \n28.  When A.B. was finally enrolled in the Copiague School District, she was referred \n• \nto their Committee on Special Education (\"CSE\") and found to have a disability.  There was a \nwaiting list, however, for the recommended BOCES placement, and A.B. was placed on home \n• \ntutoring at the Copiague Public Library.  The tutoring was not provided on a consistent basis . \nThe tutor frequently did not show up, and when she did show up, would spend at most ninety \nminutes with A.B. rather than a full school day.  \n• \n29.  In  March  2003,  A.B.  was  scheduled to  be  screened  at  a  30-day program  at \n-8-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 9 of 51 PageID #: 9\nSagamore Children's Center (\"Sagamore\") for acceptance into the BOCES placement.  At this \n• \npoint, however, the emergency housing placement for R.I. and A.B. was moved to a shelter in \nCenter Moriches, New York, and outside of the Copiague School District.  When the Copiague \n•  School District was informed of the new address, the district informed R.I. that because they no \nlonger resided in the Copiague School District, they would not provide busing for A.B. to attend \nher March 2003 appointments at Sagamore.  In addition, representatives of the shelter in which \n• \nR.I. and A.B. were housed called SCDSS to request that they send transportation to take A.B. to \nher appointment at Sagamore.  The SCDSS had consistently refused to provide busing for A.B. \nto attend Sagamore, and again refused on this occasion.  Because R.I. did not have the money to \n• \ntransport A.B. to her appointments at Sagamore, A.B. was not able to attend. \n30.  In the subsequent weeks and months, SCDSS moved R.I.'s and A.B.'s temporary \n•  housing several times, as a result of which the school district frequently stopped supplying any \ntutoring services  and transportation to  A.B.  Moreover,  A.B.  has  missed approximately six \nmonths of school in the aggregate waiting for transportation arrangements to catch up to her \n• \nvarious new temporary housing placements.  Nonetheless, A.B. has received no compensatory \nservices or special education to address the period of time she was denied such services. \n•  31.  R.I. and A.B. have recently been informed that they may not be allowed to remain \nin their current housing past April or May 2004.  In such event, they will probably be placed \nback into emergency housing shelters, motels, etc., and thus they fear that further disruption to \n• \nA.B.'s schooling and special education services, as outlined above, is imminent. \n32.  R.I.  brings this action on her own behalf, as next friend and legal guardian of \nA.B., and on behalf of a class of homeless parents and children located in Suffolk County, New \n• \nYork. \n-9-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 10 of 51 PageID #: 10\nTheW.

All of the members of theW. family are citizens \n•  of the United States and at all times mentioned herein were and are living in Suffolk County . \n34.  At all relevant times, the W.  family has been homeless and has lacked a fixed, \nadequate and regular nighttime residence.  The W. family has no permanent address and often \n• \nspends each night of the week in a different location, or moves from place to place seeking \ntemporary shelter.  The W. family became homeless in March of 2003. \n35.  Prior to the time that theW. family became homeless, Da.W., Di.W, Da.W. and \n• \nT.H.  attended public school in the Wyandanch School District.  These children are currently \nenrolled in public school in the South Huntington School District and have attended the schools \n•  of Suffolk County all of their lives . \n36.  After becoming homeless in March 2003, SCDSS placed theW. family in a series \nof emergency hotel placements for approximately one month at a time.  Because the school-aged \n• \nchildren of M.W. were required by SCDSS to be physically present with M.W. while the W. \nfamily awaited an emergency housing placement at SCDSS offices every day during this period, \nthe children of the W.  family were denied  educational services,  even though they were  still \n• \nenrolled in the Wyandanch School District.  This requirement, which on information and belief is \na normal practice of SCDSS, forces school aged homeless children to miss school. \n• \n37 .  M.W.'s  children  have  also  been  denied  transportation  to  and  from  school, \nincluding the South Huntington schools.  For example,  M.W.  has been trying to  enroll her \ndaughter S.J. in the Head Start program.  However, she was repeatedly told by representatives of \n• \nboth the South Huntington school district and SCDSS that S.J. cannot attend Head Start because \n-10-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 11 of 51 PageID #: 11\nbus transportation has not been and will not be provided . \n• \n38.  Since becoming homeless, theW. family has on several occasions been unable to \nprocure transportation to school for the children of the W. family.  The W. family were placed in \n•  emergency shelter housing by SCDSS in April2003.  After this move, no transportation was sent \nfor her children for five days.  In late April or early May 2003, M.W. and her children were \nmoved to a different shelter, located in Southampton, New York.  Transportation to school was \n• \nnot provided for 7-8 days.  In the beginning to middle of May 2003, theW. family was moved to \nyet another shelter and again lost transportation to and from school for approximately I Yz  weeks. \n39.  In  July  2003,  M.W.  and  her  children  were  eventually moved  to  emergency \n• \nhousing in Huntington, New York.  At that time, M.W. elected to place her children in school in \nthe South Huntington School District.  Dq.W.  missed the  first  week of school because the \nschools insisted on enrollment paperwork.  No one at the South Huntington School District or the \nSCDSS informed M.W. that she had the right to have Dq.W. registered at school regardless of \nwhether  she  was  able  to  provide  certain  paperwork  relating  to,  among  other  things, \n• \nimmunizations, physicals, guardianship and utility bills. \n40.  Subsequently, the pattern of relocation and missed transportation continued.  On \nJanuary 15, 2004, M.W. and her children were moved to temporary housing in Smithtown, New \n• \nYork.  After  this  move,  the  school  bus  did  not  begin  picking  up  M.W.'s  children  for \napproximately I week.  On February 4, 2004, M.W. and her children were moved again, this \n• \ntime to Bay Shore, New York.  M.W. and her children currently reside at this location.  Once \nagain, the W. family experienced a delay in bus transportation, which has not yet been provided \nto any of the W. children.  As of the date of this complaint, the W. children have each missed \n• \nmore than one week of school.  M.W.'s children are currently out of school on mid-winter \n-11-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 12 of 51 PageID #: 12\nvacation and M.W. has been informed that bus transportation will be provided on February 23, \n• \n2004, after the mid-winter break ends. \n41.

K.K. is presently in the 5'h grade in the Longwood Central School District. \n• \n45.  While living in temporary housing in both Smithtown and Medford, officials from \nthe Longwood school district informed T.K. that they would not provide transportation to school \nfor K.K. on days of delayed openings, such as during inclement weather.

When T.K.  inquired about this,  he was  informed by school  officials  that  the \ndistrict was not sending transportation because it did not want to pay for it. \n• \n47.

The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of two Plaintiff classes (\"Class \nA,\" the \"children class;\" and \"Class B,\" the \"parent class\"), pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The \n• \nclasses are defined as follows: \na.  Class A: All school aged children (as defined by New York State Education Law) \nwho, on or after  September 1, 2001: (1) have lived, are living or will live in \nSuffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been, are, or will be \n• \n\"homeless\" as defined in the McKiuney-Vento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434A . \nb.  Class B: All parents, guardians or persons in a parental relationship for children in \nClass A, who, on or after September I, 2001:  (I) have lived, are living or will \nlive in Suffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been, are or \n•  wilJ be \"homeless\" as defined in the McKiuney-Vento Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11434A. \n89.  According to estimates by the Suffolk County Joint Task Force on Homelessness, \nclass members currently number in the hundreds.  It is estimated, for example, that some 2,300 \n• \nresidents of Suffolk County are homeless and live in emergency housing, of which I ,400 are \nchildren. \n90.  On information and belief, many of these children, if they are permitted by the \n• \nDefendants to continue to attend school at all, are forced to transfer multiple times to different \nplacements in different school districts during the course of a school year, causing them to miss \n•  numerous days of school.  Such frequent changes occur because of the inherently transient nature \nof homelessness and because the Defendants have failed to comply with certain requirements of \nthe McKinney-Vento Act.  Defendants have not taken steps to ensure that these children remain \n• \nin their schools of origin if at all possible, despite their homelessness, nor do they assist homeless \n-20-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 21 of 51 PageID #: 21\nfamilies in a way that ensures that the children receive consistent, uninterrupted transportation to \n• \nenable them to  attend the schools designated for them by their parents.  Because many class \nmembers lack any fixed and regular residence and are forced to move from place to place and \nbecause the class is so numerous, joinder is impracticable . \n• \n91.  There  are  questions  of law  and  fact  common  to  the  class,  which  common \nquestions  predominate  over  any  questions  affecting  only  individual  class  members.  The \n• \nDefendants have engaged in a persistent and repeated pattern of refusing to remove barriers to \neducation of homeless children, despite their statutory and regulatory obligations to do so, and as \na result have in essence denied homeless children a free and appropriate public school education . \n• \nThe Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that are  generally applicable to  the \nclasses, thereby making appropriate injunctive relief and declaratory relief with respect to the \n•  classes as a whole . \n92.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the two classes. \nHomeless  children  in  Suffolk  face  comparable,  if not  identical,  barriers  to  entering  and \n• \nremaining in public school in Suffolk County, New York.  Without access to an adequate and \ncontinuous public education, all of these children face serious setbacks in their developmental \npath to becoming productive, self-sufficient adults . \n• \n93.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nThey are ready and able to pursue this case in the interests of the classes and have no interests \n• \nadverse to those of the class members they represent.  They have retained counsel with sufficient \nexpertise in class action and civil rights litigation to prosecute the case. \n94.  Certifying  a  class  here  is  an  appropriate  method  for  the  fair  and  efficient \n• \nadjudication of the  controversy.  Absent  class  certification,  it  is  unlikely that  the  unlawful \n-21-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 22 of 51 PageID #: 22\nbehavior by the Defendants described herein could be remedied, particularly given the numerous \n• \nobstacles to bringing and maintaining a lawsuit faced by homeless families.  Indeed, absent class \ncertification, it is  almost certain that homeless children's voices will  not be heard,  and  the \nsystemic failure to educate homeless children in Suffolk County will continue unabated . \n• \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Plight of Homeless Children in Suffolk Countv, New York \n• \n95.  Upon information and belief, there are currently some 550-600 homeless families \nin Suffolk County, comprising approximately 2,300 people. \n•  96 .  Upon  information and belief, the homeless population of Suffolk County has \ndoubled in the last three years and continues to climb.  The precise number of homeless families \nand children is difficult to calculate due to the mobility and lack of permanent residence of the \n• \nhomeless and the societal stigma associated with homelessness. \n97.  Of the approximately 2,300 homeless people living in Suffolk County New York, \nit is estimated that approximately 1, 400-more than 60%-are children . \n• \n98.  As  of the  end  of 2002,  approximately 550  homeless  families  were  living  in \nemergency housing provided by the Social Services Defendants.  Due to  the lack of shelter \n• \nspace, however, the Social Services Defendants have placed over 176 families in motels . \n99.  SCDSS  requires  that  all  members  of a homeless  family,  including  employed \nadults who are missing work and school-age children who are missing school, appear at one of \n• \nfive local county centers to be screened, have their eligibility determined and, sometimes, be \nplaced in emergency housing.  Depending on the size of the family, the difficulty in finding a \n•  vacant placement, and the number of families already being served by the county's emergency \n-22-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 23 of 51 PageID #: 23\nhousing system, the SCDSS housing unit (\"Central Housing\") is often unable to find placements \n• \nfor a particular evening. \n100.  A family which has not been placed by Central Housing by the end of the day, \neven if they have been sitting in a local center all day, must contact the Emergency Services (ES) \n• \nunit of SCDSS by calling the emergency after-hours number themselves, later that night, after \nthe center is closed. Placements made byES are drawn from a pool (mostly of hotels and motels) \n• \nseparate and apart from the more stable placements handled by Central Housing . \n101.  A family placed by ES is required to return to the local center the next day (or the \nnext business day) with all members of the family (including school-aged children) and all of \n• \ntheir belongings, to await placement again for that evening. During the present ongoing crisis of \nhomelessness in the county, the family may be required to wait all day in the local center and \n•  then again be told that there are no stable placements available and so the frnaily must call ES \nagain. They may be placed that night in a different hotel or motel, or in the same motel, even in \nthe same room as the night before. The next day they are required to again return to the local \n• \ncenter, with all members of the family and all of their belongings, to repeat the same process \nuntil they receive a more stable placement. \n102.  Even when  a homeless  family  is  finally  placed in  a more  stable  emergency \n• \nhousing, it takes  five days,  sometimes longer,  to  set up  bus transportation to  get school-age \nchildren back to  school.  Because of the  ongoing crisis in the county homeless  families  in \n• \nSuffolk are virtually never placed within their school district of origin.  If at any time the family \nis transferred to a different emergency housing placement, it again takes five days, sometimes \nlonger, to re-establish school transportation . \n• \n103.  In fact, when SCDSS deauthorizes or discontinues a family from one emergency \n-23-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 24 of 51 PageID #: 24\nhousing placement in order to transfer them to another, it also discontinues the supportive service \n• \nof school bus transportation.  No  attempt is made to  ensure that the  already established bus \ntransportation  continues  uninterrupted  despite  the  transfer  of the  homeless  family  from  one \nshelter to another . \n• \n104.  Upon information and belief, SCDSS has no system in place to provide school \ntransportation for the school-age children of families placed in non-stable emergency housing by \n• \nES . \nObstacles Facing Homeless Children in the Public Schools \n105.  Homeless children face unique obstacles to enrolling in and remaining in public \n• \nschool.  Public schools traditionally required proof of a \"permanent address\" as a prerequisite to \nenrollment.  Homeless families, by their very nature, lack such a permanent address and thus \n•  were often turned away at the schoolhouse door . \n106.  ln  addition,  public  school  districts  including  the  School  District  Defendants \ntypically demanded a host of records and documentation that cannot reasonably be demanded of \n• \nhomeless  children  and  their  families.  Homeless  children  for  example,  are hard  pressed to \ndocument  their  residency  or  retain  immunization  records.  Nonetheless,  without  such \ndocumentation, school districts routinely turned away homeless children and refused to enroll \n• \nthem. \n107.  The parents of homeless children often face a further obstacle in ensuring that \n•  their children receive the education they are entitled to-namely, the absence of transportation to \nenable their children to attend school.  Because school districts found it administratively difficult \nto cope with the ever-changing addresses of homeless families, they often declined to transport \n• \nthem at all.  Homeless children thus often found themselves with no reliable means to get to and \n-24-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 25 of 51 PageID #: 25\nfrom school. \n• \n108.  Changes in the school enviromnent can impede the opportunities for homeless \nchildren to achieve success in education.  Research indicates that students who change schools \n•  due to unplanned residential mobility, such as that associated with homelessness, score lower on \nstandardized tests and have lower overall academic achievement.  They are more likely to drop \nout of school and experience emotional and behavioral difficulties.  Their educational needs are \n• \noften unrecognized and umnet. \n109.  Various other obstacles have historically stood in the way of homeless children \nobtaining  a  public  school  education.  Aside  from  the  stigma  and  isolation  imposed  by \n• \nhomelessness,  homeless  children  have  often  found  that  the  requirements  imposed by  social \nservice agencies were at odds with the requirements of school districts.  Homeless families were \n•  required to  make difficult choices not faced by other families,  such as  whether to  apply for \ntemporary housing or whether to send their children to school. \nEducation of the Homeless Under Federal and State Law \n• \nThe McKinney-Vento Act \n110.  Congress acted decisively to remove the obstacles faced by homeless children in \nenacting the McKinney-Vento Act, Pub. L. No. 100-77, § 102(b)(2), 100 Stat. 482,485 (codified \n• \nas  amended at 42 U.S.C.  § 11301  et seq.) in 1987 to provide a broad range of assistance to \nhomeless individuals and families.  Subtitle VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Act relates to the \n•  education of homeless children and youth.  42 U.S. C. §§ 11431-11435 . \n111.  In enacting the McKinney-Vento Act, Congress sought to ensure that homeless \nchildren would have \"equal access to the same free,  appropriate public education, including a \n• \npublic preschool education, as provided to other children and youth.\" \n-25-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 26 of 51 PageID #: 26\n112.  Thus, Congress made available funds for the States to assist in the education of \n• \nhomeless children on the condition that the States receiving such funds remove the \"compulsory \nschool attendance laws or other laws, regulations, practices, or policies that may act as a barrier \nto the enrollment, attendance, or success in school of homeless children and youth\" and that the \n• \nStates \"review and undertake steps to  revise such laws, regulations, practices,  or policies to \nensure that homeless children and youth are afforded the same free, appropriate public education \n• \nas provided to other children and youth.\" \n113.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 11434A, the McKinney-Vento Act defines \"homeless children \nand youths\" to include: \n• \n(i)  children and youths who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of \nhousing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, \ntrailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate \naccommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; are abandoned \n•  in hospitals; or are waiting foster care placement; \n(ii)  children and youths who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or \nprivate place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping \naccommodation for human beings (within the meaning of section 10  3(a)(2)(C); \n• \n(iii)  children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned \nbuildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings; and \n(iv)  migratory children (as such term is defined in section 1309 of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965) who qualify as homeless for the purposes of \n•  this subtitle because the children are living in circumstances described in clauses \n(i) through (iii). \n114.  To carry out the purposes of the McKinney-Vento Act as it relates to educational \n•  opportunities for homeless children, the U.S.  Secretary of Education makes grants directly to \n\"state educational agencies.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11432.  Under the McKinney-Vento Act, NYSED  is a \n\"state educational agency.\" \n• \n115.  New York, like every other state, receives federal funds to carry out the purposes \n-26-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 27 of 51 PageID #: 27\nof the McKinney-Vento Act.  Upon information and belief, for the fiscal year 2001, NYSED \n• \nreceived McKinney-Vento Fnnds in the amount of$3,420,665.00.  Upon information and belief, \nfor the fiscal year 2002, NYSED received $5,041,904.00 in McKinney-Vento Funds and in 2003 \n•  it received $5,568,814.00 in such funds-a more than 10% increase over 2002 . \n116.  The McKinney-Vento Act, at 42 U.S.C. § 11432(g), requires the State to provide \nfor the education of homeless children and youth within the State, and the plan adopted by the \n• \nState must show how the state will  ensure that  local  educational  agencies  in  the  State will \ncomply with the requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act. \n117.  Under the McKinney-Vento Act, the local educational agencies are required to \n• \ndevelop,  review  and  revise  policies  to  remove  barriers  to  the  enrollment  and  retention  of \nhomeless  children  and  youth  in  their  schools.  42  U.S.C.  §  11432(g)(l)(I);  42  U.S.C. \n•  § 11432(g)(7) . \n118.  Under the McKinney-Vento Act, each local educational agency must designate a \nliaison, who must ensure that:  homeless children and youths are identified; homeless children \n• \nand youths  enroll  in,  and have  a full  and equal  opportunity to  succeed in school;  homeless \nfamilies, children and youths receive educational services for which they are eligible, including \nHead Start, Even Start and public preschool programs; parents or guardians of homeless children \n• \nare informed of the educational and related opportunities available to their children and provided \nwith  meaningful  opportunities  to  participate  in  their  children's  education;  public  notice  of \neducational rights is disseminated where children and youth receive services, such as schools, \nfamily  shelters,  and  soup  kitchens;  and  parents,  guardians  and  youth  are  fully  informed of \ntransportation services and assisted in accessing those services.  42 U.S.C. § 11432(g)(6)(A) . \n• \n119.  The McKinney-Vento Act further provides that \"The Coordinator for Education \n-27-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 28 of 51 PageID #: 28\nof Homeless Children and Youths established in each State shall ...

The IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, \n•  provide children with disabilities a substantive right to a \"free appropriate public education\" in \nthe \"least restrictive environment\" in those states that receive federal assistance provided under \nIDEA.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a); 34 C.R.R. §§ 300.550-300.556 . \n• \n122.  The State Education Department and, through NYSED, the boards of education \n(LEAs or School Districts such as Bay Shore and Longwood) receive funds appropriated under \nIDEA and, therefore are subject to its requirements.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a), 1413(a).  Upon \n• \ninformation and belief, the School District Defendants have received funds from NYSED out of \nthe money the State Defendants received from the federal  government under the McKinney \n• \nVento Act. \n123.  1n order to receive federal assistance under IDEA, each State must develop a plan \nthat  assures  a  free  appropriate  public  education to  all  children with disabilities,  aged  three \n• \nthrough twenty-one.  20 U.S.C. § 1412 (a)(1)(A). \n-28-\n• \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 29 of 51 PageID #: 29\nNew York State Education Law \n• \n124.

New York State Education Law § 3209 commits the Defendants to provide for the \n• \neducation of homeless children in New York State . \n126.  Pursuant  to  statutory  authority,  the  Defendant  Commissioner  of Education \nenacted regulations which provide for the education of homeless children in New York State.  8 \n• \nNYCRR § 100.2 (x). \n127.

It is up to the parent or guardian to determine whether \n• \nthe homeless child shall attend the school district of current location or the school district of \norigin.  These sections also require that homeless children be provided with transportation to \neither the district of origin or the district of current location . \n• \n128.  Recent amendments to the New York State law from the Summer of 2003  also \nrequire the LEAs to comply with 42 U.S.C. §§ 11432(g)(3) through (7). \n• \n129.

Under the aforementioned Jaws, the State Defendants are obligated, among other \nthings, to: \n•  a.  prepare and carry out an adequate state plan for implementing the McKinney \nVento Act and ensure the LEA's compliance with the plan; \nb.  require the  LEA's to  ensure  that  all  homeless  school  age  children in  Suffolk \nCounty and New York State have access to a free appropriate public education; \n• \nc .  coordinate with local social service and housing agencies and programs providing \nservices to homeless children and youth including shelters,  the Department of \nSocial  Services,  residential  programs  for  runaway  and  homeless  youth \n(established pursuant to  article nineteen-H  of the executive law of New York \nState); \nd.  ensure that the local social service agency complies with the provisions of New \nYork  State  Education  law  and  its  regulations  in  providing  education  and \ntransportation services to homeless children and youth; \ne.  review and revise policies that may act as barriers to, and provide services that \n• \nenable the enrollment, attendance and success in school of each homeless child in \nSuffolk County and New York State, including policies related to transportation, \nrecords-requirements and residency requirements; \nf.  provide procedures  for  the prompt resolution  of placement and transportation \n•  assistance disputes affecting homeless children in Suffolk County and New York \nState; \ng.  identify and address problems affecting the education of homeless children in the \nSuffolk County and New York State; \n• \nh .  assure that policies and practices are adopted by the state and LEAs to ensure that \nhomeless children in the Suffolk County and New York State are not stigmatized \nor isolated; \nI.  ensure that the LEAs provide written notice to homeless school-age children and \n•  the parents or legal guardians of such children of any adverse action affecting \ntheir  placement  in  schools,  a  fair  opportunity  to  challenge  such  decisions, \nincluding  the  notice  of the  availability of an  ombudsperson and  a process of \nresolving the dispute; \nj.  ensure the LEAs compliance with state Jaw and regulations (New York Education \n• \nLaw section 3209 and 8 NYCRR 100.2 (x); \n-30-\n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 31 of 51 PageID #: 31\nk.  ensure  that  the  LEAs  locate  and provide  educational  services  to  all  eligible \n•  children in the County of Suffolk and New York State; \nI.  ensure that the state, the state educational agency and the LEAs carry out the \nmandates of the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1412, and its regulations and that the LEAs \ncomply with Article 89 of New York State Education Law and its regulations to \nprovide a  free  appropriate public education to  students classified as  having a \ndisability pursuant to these statutes and regulations; \nm.  ensure that homeless children and youth are able to participate in Federal, State or \nlocal food programs; \n• \nn .  ensure that homeless children have equal access to  the same public preschool \nprograms, administered by the State agency, as provided to other children; \no.  ensure that homeless youths and youths separated from the public schools are \nidentified  and  accorded  equal  access  to  appropriate  secondary  education  and \n•  support services; \np.  identify homeless children and youth and assess their special needs. \n131.

At all relevant times, the Social Services Defendants have had the duty to comply \n• \nwith all applicable provisions bearing upon the education of the named Plaintiffs and Class \nmembers, including the obligations to: \n• \na .  ensure that each homeless child who is eligible for benefits pursuant to  section \n350-j  of the  Social  Services  Law,  receives  transportation  to  and  from  the \ntemporary housing location in which the child was placed; \nb.  make available to  each homeless child located in a temporary housing facility \n•  operated or approved  by SCDSS,  a person designated  by the  social  services \nagency who shall within two business days, assist the child's guardian or other \ndesignator (as defined in New York State Education Law§ 3209) in completing \nthe designation forms  in order that the homeless child may be enrolled in the \ndesignated school district. \n•· \nc.  ensure that each homeless child and his or her family not be subject to any policy, \nprocedure, rule or requirement that in any way interferes with the ability of the \nhomeless child to be in attendance at school. \nDefendants' Violations of Their Statutory and Other Duties \n• \n133.  In contrast to these duties, the Defendants have repeatedly and persistently failed \nto meet their obligations under the relevant laws.  Among other things, and as detailed more fully \nherein, the Defendants have failed to revise their policies and practices regarding transportation \n-32-\n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 33 of 51 PageID #: 33\nwhich act as a barrier to the enrollment attendance and success of homeless youths and have \n• \nfailed  to  ensure  that  LEAs  revise  their  policies  and  practices  regarding  transportation  of \nhomeless children.  For example, homeless children seeking transportation to or from the school \nof their choice are often denied transportation simply because they lack a permanent address.  As \na  result,  members  of the  Class  seeking  to  enroll  in  public  school  have  been  denied  that \nopportunity for lack of transportation to the school of their designation. \n• \n134.  Suffolk County Department of Social  Services,  for  example,  pursues a policy \ngranting them a five-day window in which to provide transportation for a homeless child making \nsuch a request,  but only after the  family has  been placed in a \"stable\" emergency housing \n• \nplacement.  The practical effect of this self-declared requirement is that weeks or months can \nelapse  before  children  are  provided  the  transportation  to  school  that  the  Suffolk  County \n•  Department of Social Services is statutorily required to provide upon request.  Indeed,  some \nPlaintiffs are denied \"stable\" emergency housing for months or longer, and only receive such \nhousing after they demand an administrative \"fair hearing\" before an Administrative Law Judge. \n• \nOn  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  known  to  and  approved  by  the  Social  Services \nDefendants. \n13 5.  The  Social  Services  Defendants  have  been  ordered,  by  the  Principal \nAdministrative  Law  Judge  of OT ADA,  to  review  the  transportation  situation  of homeless \nfamilies \"to ensure that school transportation is provided to children of homeless families.\"  On \ninformation and belief,  the Social Services Defendants have ignored this ruling of their own \nPrincipal Administrative Law Judge and have refused to address their failure to provide adequate \ntransportation for homeless children to and from school. \n• \n136.  The Defendants have also failed to meet their statutory obligations by failing to \n-33-\n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 34 of 51 PageID #: 34\ncoordinate the activities of the School District Defendants with other service providers such as \nthe  Social  Services Defendants.  In some  instances,  detailed more fully below,  the policies \nimposed  by  the  Social  Services  Defendants  as  a  precondition  to  the  Plaintiffs  receiving \ntemporary housing or other services are the basis of the School District Defendants refusal to \nprovide transportation services or other educational services to homeless children.  For example, \nthe Social Services Defendants often require an entire family, children included, to be present at \n• \nlocal  social services  centers  all  day,  sometimes  for  weeks  on end,  simply to  apply  and  be \nassessed for temporary housing each and every business day.  The effect of this requirement is to \nforce  homeless  families  to  choose  between  temporary  housing  and  the  education  of their \n• \nchildren, a choice that is plainly impermissible under federal and state law. \n137.  The School District Defendants have violated the law by providing incorrect or \n•  false  information to homeless families  seeking to enroll their child in an appropriate district. \nSometimes the School District Defendants falsely informed homeless families that they could not \nenroll in the school district when federal and state law expressly provided that they could.  In \n• \nsome instances, the School District Defendants have simply refused, without basis, to process the \nSTAC forms submitted by parents of homeless children. \n138.  The Defendants have also failed to establish an effective and timely procedure for \n• \nthe resolution of disputes pertaining to the educational services provided to homeless children in \nSuffolk County.  In some instances, homeless children and their families have no  established \n• \nmeans of addressing disputes.  Where dispute resolution procedures are available, they are slow, \nand  virtually  impossible  to  navigate  without  an  attorney,  rendering  them  inappropriate  for \nresolving the needs of homeless children.  As a result, homeless children who have been denied \n• \naccess to the school of their choice or who have been denied other educational rights have had to \n-34-\n• \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 35 of 51 PageID #: 35\nwait an inordinate period of time to have those issues resolved, if they are resolved at all . \n• \n139.  The Defendants have placed other unlawful obstacles in the way of the education \nof homeless children.  For example, on information and belief, Hampton Bays, Amityville and \nperhaps other school districts have required records before permitting enrollment.  Some school \n• \ndistricts refuse to provide free school meals without completed applications. \n140.  The Defendants have also violated the above-referenced statutes and regulations \n• \nby failing to ensure that the LEAs such as the School District Defendants identify and address \nenrollment  delays  occasioned  by  cumbersome,  unnecessary  and  time-consuming  record \nrequirements, enrollment and  transfer requirements.  Upon information and  belief,  homeless \n• \nchildren  are  denied  enrollment to  public  school  because they lack  a permanent  address  or \nbecause  they lack  other records  or documentation  that  they do  not  have  because  they  are \n•  homeless.  As a result, homeless children seeking to enroll in a school in which they are entitled \nto enroll by statute are often denied enrollment or find that enrollment is unreasonably delayed \nbecause of record requirements that are impractical for homeless children.  Such requirements \n• \nconstitute an impermissible barrier to enrollment under the McKinney-Vento Act and New York \nState Education Law§ 3209. \n141.  Relatedly, the Defendants have not adopted appropriate policies or procedures to \n• \nenforce the decisions of ombudspersons and/or the dispute resolution process for LEAs such as \nthe School District Defendants.  Upon information and belief, the School District Defendants \n• \nroutinely and systematically ignore the ombudsperson and/or the dispute resolution process with \nrespect  to  the  education  and/or  transportation  of homeless  children.  On  occasion,  the \nombudsperson has directed the LEA to provide certain services or accommodations for homeless \nchildren, but the LEA has refused.  The consequence is that numerous homeless children have \n-35-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 36 of 51 PageID #: 36\nbeen forced  to  forego  their right to  an  education and/or transportation to  LEAs  such as  the \nSchool District Defendants. \n142.  The  State  Defendants,  while  aware  of  the  failure  of the  School  District \nDefendants to meet the requirements of federal and state law, have refused to take appropriate \n• \ncorrective action. \n143.  The Defendants have also violated the statutes and regulations by failing to adopt \n• \npolicies and practices or to ensure that the LEAs adopt, policies and practices that ensure that \nhomeless children are not isolated or stigmatized.  Because homeless children are denied the \nopportunity to attend school or participate in afterschool or other programs, they are often at a \n• \ndisadvantage socially vis-a-vis other children who do not face such obstacles. \n144.  The Defendants have failed to carry out the mandates of the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \n•  1412 and its regulations and ensure that the LEAs comply with Article 89 of New York State \nEducation Law and its regulations to provide a free  appropriate public education to  students \nclassified as  having a disability pursuant to  these  statutes  and  regulations.  Thus,  homeless \n• \nchildren  in  Suffolk  County  with  disabilities  are  not  being  provided  with  individualized \neducational plans (\"IEPs\") because they are being denied access to public school.  The LEAs \nincluding the School District Defendants are not complying with the IEPs for those homeless \n• \nchildren who have been provided with IEPs because of the failure to make appropriate efforts to \nensure the sustained enrollment and attendance of homeless children. \n•  145.  In  addition,  the  Defendants  are  violating  the  IDEA  by  failing  to  provide \ncompensatory educational services to homeless children, particularly those children who have \nprolonged  absences  as  a result  of the  Defendants'  failure  to  meet  the  requirements  of the \n• \nMcKinney-Vento Act or New York Education Law§ 3209. \n-36-\n• \n\n•  Case 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 37 of 51 PageID #: 37\n146.  When the state defendants have been made aware of violations of law bearing \n• \nupon the education of homeless children and/or homeless children who are also  classified as \nhaving a disability pursuant to the IDEA and Article 89 of New York State Education Law, in \nSuffolk County, they have ignored these violations, have failed to take corrective action, and/or \n• \nhave failed to make the systemic changes necessary to comp Jy with their statutory and regulatory \nduties. \n•  147.  In  short,  the Defendants  have  engaged in and  are  engaging  in  a pattern  and \npractice of, among other things, (a)  failing to  provide or providing an inadequate process for \nselecting a school that is in the best interest of the homeless child; (b) failing to  provide an \n• \nopportunity for the parent of a homeless child to state the best interest of the child in school \nselection; (c) denying homeless children the opportunity to remain in their schools of origin and \n•  forcing them to transfer to the school which serves the attendance area in which they stay while \nhomeless; (d) when homeless children move from one homeless shelter to another within Suffolk \nCounty, Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of denying them the opportunity to remain \n•  at the school serving the first shelter and forcing them to transfer to the school serving the second \n(or subsequent) shelter. \nThe Defendants' Awareness of Their Violations of Federal and State Law \n• \n148.  The Defendants are aware that they are not in compliance with federal and state \nJaw.  Among other things, Nassau Suffolk Law Services and the Long Island Advocacy Center \n•  wrote  to  Commissioner  Mills  (with  a copy of the  letter to  former  Commissioner  Wing  of \nOTADA and Commissioner DeMarzo of Suffolk County Department of Social Services) on or \nabout August 7, 2003 to detail the ways in which state and local agencies were failing to meet \n• \nthe  educational  and  transportation  needs  of homeless  children.  Only  Commissioner  Mills \n-37-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 38 of 51 PageID #: 38\nresponded, through a subordinate, and then only with a pro forma referral to the inadequate state \n• \nEducation Department dispute resolution process now in place. \n149.  The August 7, 2003 letter, of course, told Commissioner Mills nothing he did not \nalready know.  Upon information and belief, if the State Defendants performed even a cursory \n• \nreview of the programs and policies of the School District Defendants - more than a cursory \nreview is required by the McKiuney-Vento Act and New York State Jaw- they must have been \n• \naware of the almost total  failure  of the  School District Defendants to  seriously address  the \nvarious obstacles they erected preventing homeless children from  enrolling in and staying in \npublic  school.  Further,  on  information  and  belief,  Eastern  Suffolk  BOCES  staff have \n• \nconsistently brought violations to the State Defendants' attention on a regular basis over a period \nof years, but the State Defendants have failed to take appropriate action. \n•  150.  The Social Services Defendants are also we11 aware of their failure to satisfy the \nstatutory and regulatory requirements vis-a-vis homeless children.  Nonetheless, they have either \nrefused or have failed to take appropriate steps to bring their conduct within the requirements of \n• \nthe Jaw . \n151.  Among other things,  OTA  DA provides homeless persons and others receiving \nbenefits from OT ADA with an opportunity to request a \"fair hearing\" before an administrative \n• \nlaw judge. \n152.  On  information  and  belief,  OTADA's  own  Administrative  Law  Judges  have \n•  found the Suffolk County Department of Social Services to be in violation of the laws mandating \nappropriate transportation for homeless children to public schools.  For example, on January 29, \n2003, Suffolk County Department of Social Services was ordered by Principal Administrative \n• \nLaw Judge Philip Nostramo to conduct a review of its cases and policies \"to ensure that school \n-38-\n• \n\n•  Case 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 39 of 51 PageID #: 39\ntransportation is provided to children of homeless families.\"  (In the Matter of the Appeal of \n• \nAlthea M., FH #3803657H.) \n153.  Rather  than  comply  with  this  Order,  Suffolk  County  Department  of Social \nServices requested \"reconsideration\" of the Order . \n• \n154.  In a May 9, 2003  response to  Suffolk County Department of Social Services' \nrequest for \"reconsideration,\" Principal Administrative Law Judge Philip Nostramo again urged \n• \nthe  Suffolk  County Department  of Social  Services  to  work with  State  officials  to  achieve \nappropriate transportation arrangements for homeless children. \n155.  Upon information and belief, the Suffolk County Department of Social Services \n• \nhas not done so, and has failed to take any meaningful action in response to OTADA's finding \nthat SCDSS was failing to meet its statutory obligations to homeless children living in Suffolk \nCounty . \n• \n156.  In addition, in an October 2002 memorandum to all District Superintendents, and \nSchool  District  Homeless  Liaisons,  Associate  Commissioner  Sheila  Evans-Tranumn  (a \n• \nDefendant in this  action) conceded that the various obligations of the McKiuney-Vento Act, \namong others, were \"in effect and binding,\" and that \n• \n• \n• \n-39-\n• \n\n•  Case 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 40 of 51 PageID #: 40\n•  \"At the request of a parent or guardian, homeless students must be provided with \ntransportation to and from their school of origin.\" \n• \n•  \"Parents and guardians, and unaccompanied youth, are [to be] fully informed of \nall transportation services, including transportation to the school of origin, and are \nassisted in accessing transportation services.\" \n• \n•  \"A school selected must immediately enroll students in homeless situations, even \nif they do not have required documents, such as school records, medical records, \nproof of residency,  or other documents.

As  set  forth  above,  as  a result  of Defendant's  policies,  custom,  pattern  and \npractice, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm. \n• \n158.  Plaintiffs in Class A routinely are denied an opportunity to continue to attend the \nschool of origin when they become homeless. \n159.  Plaintiffs in Class A routinely are forced to transfer to several different schools \n• \n-40-\n• \n\n• \nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 1   Filed 02/20/04   Page 41 of 51 PageID #: 41\nduring the course of a single academic year as they move from one shelter placement to another \n• \nor to permanent housing. \n160.

Plaintiffs in Class A routinely are denied transportation services comparable to \n• \nthose afforded other children who attend the same school. \n162.  Plaintiffs in Class A routinely are denied preschool or afterschool educational \nservices . \n• \n163.  Plaintiffs  m  Class  A  routinely  are  denied  appropriate  identification  and \nassessment. \n•  164.  As a result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiffs in Class A suffer educational and \npsychological harm and experience developmental and social delays. \n165.  Plaintiffs in Class B routinely are denied an opportunity to state the best interests \n• \nof their children in school selection . \n166.  Plaintiffs  in  Class  B,  when  they  do  express  a desire  to  keep  their  homeless \nchildren in a particular school, routinely have their wishes disregarded even when it is feasible to \n• \nkeep their children at the selected school. \n167.

All Defendants have acted under pretense and color of state law  and in their \n• \nindividual and official capacities and within the scope of their employment.  The Defendants' \nacts described herein were beyond the scope of their jurisdiction, without authority of law, and in \nabuse of their powers, and said Defendants acted willfully, knowingly, and with the specific \n• \nintent to deprive Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights secured by 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and by the \nFourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.

Presently\nbefore the Court are two motions: (1) a motion by the defendants to dismiss the action; and\n(2) a motion by the plaintiffs, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n(“Fed. R. Civ. P.”), for class certification.\nI.     BACKGROUND\n3\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 4 of 30 PageID #: 230\nThe plaintiffs in this action are homeless children and their parents living in Suffolk\nCounty, New York.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of New\nYork, New York State Education Department, Richard P. Mills, as Commissioner of\nEducation of the State of New York, Sheila Evans-Tranumn, as Associate Commissioner of\nEducation of the State of New York, Patricia Mcguirk, as Program Manager for the\nHomeless of the New York State Education Department, New York State Office of\nTemporary and Disability Assistance, Robert Doar, as Acting Commissioner of the New\nYork State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, Suffolk County Department of\nSocial Services, Janet Demarzo, as Commissioner of the Suffolk County Department of\nSocial Services, Dan Hickey, as Associate Commissioner of the Suffolk County Department\nof Social Services and John Doe, School Districts 1-10, (collectively the “Defendants”), for\nalleged violations \nof the McKinney-Vento Act (“McKinney Act”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek to invoke the\nprovisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce the terms of the McKinney Act and the\nConstitution.\nThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants are responsible for a systematic failure to\nprovide homeless children in Suffolk County, New York, access to education by failing to:\n(1) locate and ensure enrollment of homeless children; (2) provide uninterrupted\n4\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 5 of 30 PageID #: 231\ntransportation to enable homeless children to attend school; (3) provide immediate\nenrollment to homeless children upon becoming homeless; and (4) provide  education\nservices that are comparable to the services that nonhomeless children receive.  The\nPlaintiffs allege that homeless children are entitled to these educational services through the\nprovisions of the McKinney Act and the Constitution.\nThe proposed class representatives are six homeless families with school-age\nchildren in Suffolk County who all allege that they have faced obstacles in maintaining\nenrollment in school.  From the allegations in the complaint, a common theme emerges.  All\nof the children at some time became homeless and, as a consequence of their parents’\nmisfortune, missed weeks and sometimes months of school due to failures in transportation\nor enrollment.  For example, the W. family has four school-age children and one pre-school\nage child who was denied access to Head Start.  After becoming homeless, the family\nmoved from shelter to shelter, and with each move, transportation to and from school\nstopped, thus causing the children to miss school for weeks at a time.  Another plaintiff, S.P.,\nwas out of school for more than two months while various agencies tried to determine who\nshould provide transportation for the child.  In another example, A.B., was attending school\nin the Middle Country Central School District until her family was placed in emergency\nhousing in Copaigue.  Both school districts refused to admit the child—Middle Country\ninsisted she attend the Copaigue School District while Copaigue declined to admit A.B.\n5\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 6 of 30 PageID #: 232\nwithout the proper paperwork.  As a result, A.B. missed months of school.  \nBecause a motion to dismiss is potentially dispositive, the Court will discuss that\nmotion first, followed by the motion for class certification.\nII.     DISCUSSION\nA. Motion to Dismiss\nA court may grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim only\nwhen “it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.’ ”  Phillip v. University of Rochester, 316 F.3d 291,\n293 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45–46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed.\n2d 80 (1957)); Kaltman-Glasel v. Dooley, 156 F. Supp. 2d 225, 226 (D. Conn. 2001).\nThe function of the Court is not to weigh the evidence that may be presented at trial but\ninstead the Court must determine if the claims are legally sufficient. Goldman v. Belden, 754\nF.2d 1059, 1067 (2d Cir. 1985); see also King v. Simpson, 189 F.3d 284, 287 (2d Cir.\n1999).  The Court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff and accept\nthe allegations contained in the claims as true. See Desiderio v. National Ass’n of Sec.\nDealers, Inc., 191 F.3d 198, 202 (2d Cir. 1999).\nIn deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion a court may consider “only the facts alleged in\nthe pleadings, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the pleadings\nand matters of which judicial notice may be taken . . . .” Samuels v. Air Transport Local\n6\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 7 of 30 PageID #: 233\n504, 992 F.2d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 1993).  Therefore, a court must evaluate whether the\nallegations in the complaint can sustain a cause of action under applicable law, and should\nonly grant the motion to dismiss if the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their\nclaims that would entitle them to relief. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506,\n122 S. Ct. 992, 998, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002); Grandon v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 147 F.3d\n184, 188 (2d Cir. 1998).\nActions may be brought pursuant to section 1983 against state actors to enforce\nrights created by federal statutes and the Constitution. Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4,\n100 S. Ct. 2502, 2502, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1980).  In order to seek redress through section\n1983, “a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal\nlaw.”  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S. Ct. 1353, 1359, 137 L. Ed. 2d\n569 (1997).  Here, the Plaintiffs seek to redress the right of homeless children and youths to\nhave access to the same educational services that are available to children who are not\nhomeless.  The Plaintiffs allege that this right is found in the McKinney Act and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  Therefore, the Court\nmust examine whether that right does exists under the McKinney Act or the Constitution.\n1. The McKinney-Vento Act\nThe McKinney-Vento Act was enacted in 1987 “to provide urgently needed\nassistance to protect and improve the lives and safety of the homeless . . . .”  Pub. L. No.\n7\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 8 of 30 PageID #: 234\n100-77, 101 Stat. 525 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 11431(1988)).  The Act required states to\nassure that each child of a homeless individual and each homeless youth had access to a free\nand appropriate public education.  42 U.S.C. § 11431.  Under the Act, Congress\nauthorized the Secretary of Education to grant funds to the States that comply with the\nprovisions of the Act.  Id. § 11432.\nIn 2002, the McKinney Act was reauthorized as part of the No Child Left Behind\nAct (NCLBA).  Pub. L. No. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1989.  As part of the reauthorization, the\nMcKinney Act underwent a general revision, but the purpose of the Act remained to “ensure\nthat each child of a homeless individual and each homeless youth has equal access to the\nsame free, appropriate public education, including a public preschool education, as provided\nto other children and youths.”  42 U.S.C. § 11431 (2004).  Congress stated that\n“[h]omelessness alone is not sufficient reason to separate students from the mainstream\nschool environment.”  Id.  Thus, “[h]omeless children and youths should have access to the\neducation and other services” that are needed to meet “student academic achievement\nstandards to which all students are held.”  Id.\nA court’s role in determining whether personal rights exist in the section 1983\ncontext is to initially determine whether Congress intended to confer individual rights upon a\nclass of persons.  Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 2276,\n153 L. Ed.2d 309 (2002).  “For a statute to create such private rights, its text must be\n8\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 9 of 30 PageID #: 235\n‘phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.’ ” Id. at 284, 122 S. Ct. at 2275 (quoting\nCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692, n. 13, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 60 L. Ed. 2d\n560 (1979)); accord Rabin v. Wilson-Coker, 362 F.3d 190 (2d Cir. 2004).  In addition, a\ncourt must “determine if Congress foreclosed a § 1983 remedy either expressly or impliedly\nthrough the creation of a comprehensive administrative enforcement scheme.”  Taylor v.\nVermont Dep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d 768, 783 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing Blessing, 520 U.S. at\n342).\nLegislation enacted pursuant to the spending authority of Congress must clearly\nmanifest an “unambiguous intent” to confer individual rights. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 122\nS. Ct. at 2273.  This standard recognizes that the typical remedy for state noncompliance\nwith federal spending legislation is action by the Federal Government to terminate the funds,\nrather than a private cause of action for noncompliance.  Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1981).  Thus,\na significant part of a court’s inquiry is whether the federal agency charged with administering\nthe funds has procedures by which individuals can complain about alleged failures by the\nstate entrusted with those funds.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 122 S. Ct. at 2273.\nIn Gonzaga, the Supreme Court recently found that a provision in the Family\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) did not create individual rights because the\nfocus of the statute was “two steps removed from the interests of individual students and\n9\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 10 of 30 PageID #: 236\nparents.”  Id. at 287, 122 S. Ct at 2277; see 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1).  In other words,\n“the statute only forbade the government from funding schools that demonstrated a ‘policy or\npractice’ of disclosing student records.”  Rabin v. Wilson-Coker, 362 F.3d 190, 201 (2d\nCir. 2004) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287, 122 S. Ct. at 2277).\nThe Court in Gonzaga explained that FERPA focuses on the aggregate impact of\nreleasing educational records, rather than being concerned with “whether the needs of any\nparticular person have been satisfied.”  Id. at 288.  The Court noted that this was evident by\nthe fact that recipient institutions need only “comply substantially” to receive funding.  Id. at\n288, 122 S. Ct. at 2278; see also Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 358, 112 S. Ct 1360,\n1367, 118 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992) (holding that no enforceable right under the Adoption\nAssistance Act of 1980, which required States receiving funds to have a “plan” to make\n“reasonable efforts” to keep children out of foster homes).\nThe Court in Gonzaga recognized that in the past, spending legislation was held to\nconfer individually enforceable rights if the provision was focused on an individual class of\npersons and imposed a mandatory obligation on the State.  For example, in Wright v.\nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 107 S. Ct. 766, 93\nL.Ed.2d 781 (1987), the Court held that a provision of the Public Housing Act conferred\nindividual rights on the ground that the statute unambiguously imposed a “mandatory [rent]\nlimitation [on States, which] focus[ed] on the individual family and its income.”  Id. at 430,\n10\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 11 of 30 PageID #: 237\n107 S. Ct. at 773–74.  In Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 522, 110 S. Ct.\n2510, 110 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1990), the Court held that a reimbursement provision of the\nMedicare Act conferred individual rights, on the ground that the statute “impose[d] a binding\nobligation on States participating in the Medicaid program to adopt reasonable and adequate\nrates.”  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 512, 110 S. Ct. at 2518–19.\nIn both Wilder and Wright, “Congress left no doubt of its intent for private\nenforcement” because the statutes: (1) imposed a mandatory requirement on the States; (2)\nprovided for specific entitlements; (3) conferred entitlements on specific individuals, and (4)\ndid not provide individuals with sufficient administrative means of enforcing the requirement\nagainst States that failed to comply.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280–81, 122 S. Ct. at\n2274.\nIn light of these guidelines, it is clear that Congress intended that the McKinney Act\nconfer individually enforceable rights.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia has held that the McKinney Act confers enforceable rights on homeless children.\nLampkin v. District of Columbia, 27 F.3d 605, 611 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  First, the Act\nimposes a mandatory rather than horatory requirement on the State.  The Act states that\n“[h]omeless children and youths should have access to the education and other services that\n11\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 12 of 30 PageID #: 238\nsuch children and youths need . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 11431 (emphasis added).  In order to\nprovide such services, States, including New York, are granted funds which \nshall be used for the following:\n(1) To carry out the policies set forth in section 11431 of this title in the State.\n(2) To provide activities for, and services to, homeless children, including\npreschool-aged homeless children, and youths that enable such children and\nyouths to enroll in, attend, and succeed in school, or, if appropriate, in\npreschool programs.\n(3) To establish or designate an Office of Coordinator for Education of\nHomeless Children and Youths in the State educational agency in accordance\nwith subsection (f) of this section.\n(4) To prepare and carry out the State plan described in subsection (g) of this\nsection.\n(5) To develop and implement professional development programs for school\npersonnel to heighten their awareness of, and capacity to respond to, specific\nproblems in the education of homeless children and youths.\n42 U.S.C.A. § 11432.  These requirements are not optional and  “substantial compliance”\nor “reasonable efforts” is insufficient under the Act. \nSecond, the Act provides for specific entitlements by directing local educational\nagencies to carry out specific activities.  In particular, the local educational agency is\nrequired to:\n(i) continue the child’s or youth’s education in the school of origin for the\nduration of homelessness–\n(I) in any case in which a family becomes homeless between academic\nyears or during an academic year; or\n(II) for the remainder of the academic year, if the child or youth\nbecomes permanently housed during an academic year; or\n12\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 13 of 30 PageID #: 239\n(ii) enroll the child or youth in any public school that nonhomeless  stud\nents\nwho\nlive\ni n\nt h e\natten\ndanc\ne\narea\ni n\nwhic\nh the\nchild\no r\nyout\nh  is\nactu\nally\nliving\na r e\neligi\nb l e\nt o\natten\nd.\n42 U.S.C.A. §§ 11432(g)(3)(A).  In addition, the Act specifically directs that local educational\nagencies—\n(i) shall immediately enroll the homeless child or youth, even if the child or youth\nis unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous\nacademic  records,  medical  records,  proof  of  residency,  or  other\ndocumentation.\n(ii) The enrolling school shall immediately contact the school last attended by\nthe child or youth to obtain relevant academic and other records.\n13\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 14 of 30 PageID #: 240\n(iii) If the child or youth needs to obtain immunizations, or immunization or\nmedical records, the enrolling school shall immediately refer the parent or\nguardian of the child or youth to the local educational agency liaison designated\nunder  paragraph  (1)(J)(ii),  who  shall  assist  in  obtaining  necessary\nimmunizations, or immunization or medical records . . . .\n42 U.S.C.A. § 11432(g)(3)(C).  Thus, unlike other spending provisions that do not confer\nindividually enforceable rights, “the McKinney Act not only inform[s] the State in great detail\non how its plan is to be implemented, [it] impose[s] obligations that are independent of the\nplan.”  Lampkin, at 611.  \nThird, the entitlements conferred under the Act are directed at specific individuals. \nStatutes that focus on specific individuals rather than policies or practices indicate\nCongressional intent to confer individually enforceable rights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287,\n122 S. Ct. at 2277 (stating that FERPA’s provisions were “two steps removed from the\ninterests of individuals . . .”); see also Rabin v. Wilson-Coker, 362 F.3d 190, 201 (2d Cir.\n2004) (explaining that “the statute only forbade the government from funding schools that\ndemonstrated a ‘policy or practice’ of disclosing student \nrecords”).  By directing local educational agencies, rather than recommending statewide\npolicies, the Act confers entitlements to each homeless child, including: (1) the right of the\nparent or guardian to choose the school of origin or the school where students enroll in the\nlocation; (2) immediate assistance in obtaining immunizations or medical records necessary\nfor enrolment in the new school; (3) immediate enrollment in the school in which enrollment\n14\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 15 of 30 PageID #: 241\nis sought; (4) comparable transportation services to and from school. See 42 U.S.C. §\n11432(g)(3). \nFinally, the Act provides no “mechanisms for the administrative enforcement of the\nbeneficiaries’ rights.”  Lampkin, 27 F.3d at 611.  Under the Act, the Secretary of Education\nis authorized to “make grants” and “review” state plans, but is not authorized to take any\nenforcement for violations of the Act.  42 U.S.C. § 11434.  In Gonzaga, the Court\nrecognized that Congress chose to provide an enforcement mechanism in FERPA for\ninvestigating and adjudicating violations.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288, 122 S. Ct. at 2278. \nThe Court stated that “[t]hese administrative procedures squarely distinguish this case from\nWright and Wilder, where an aggrieved individual lacked any federal review mechanism . . .\nand further counsel against our finding a congressional intent to create individually\nenforceable private rights.”  Id. at 291, 122 S. Ct. at 2279.  Under the McKinney Act, an\naggrieved individual has no recourse against the federal agency that is granting the funds,\nwhich strongly leads to the conclusion that Congress intended to provide an individual right\nenforceable under § 1983.\nDefendants reliance on Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now v.\nNew York City Dept. of Educ., 269 F. Supp.2d 338, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“ACORN”) is\nmisplaced.  That case held that certain provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act did not\ncreate individual rights enforceable under section 1983.  Although the McKinney Act was\n15\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 16 of 30 PageID #: 242\nreauthorized as part of the NCLBA, the McKinney Act pre-dated the NCLBA and differs\nin several important aspects.\nFirst, the NCLBA has an aggregate focus in that it is a comprehensive education\nreform statute aimed at strengthening schools by holding States and local education agencies\naccountable.  See id. at 340.  In contrast, the purpose of the McKinney Act is to ensure that\neach homeless child is given an equal opportunity to access the educational system that the\nNCLBA strives to enhance.\nSecond, although both laws call for the State to adopt and implement a plan, the\nfocus of the NCLBA is whether local educational agencies are maintaining “adequate yearly\nprogress.” 20 U.S.C. § 6316(a)(1)(A); see ACORN, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 344 (“The\nprovisions of the NCLBA . . . focus on two entities—states and local educational agencies .\n. . .”).  On the other hand, the McKinney Act specifically focuses on how to ensure that each\nhomeless child receives the same opportunity and access to education as a nonhomeless\nchild.  Congress did not include in the McKinney Act that “adequate yearly progress” would\nbe sufficient.  The Act specifically provides that homeless children “should have access to\neducation and other services” and requires local educational agencies to ensure that children\nnot miss school due to the misfortunes of their parents.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11431(4) &\n11432(g)(3).  \n16\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 17 of 30 PageID #: 243\nFinally, the NCLBA expressly gives the Secretary of Education authority to impose penalties\nfor noncompliance.  20 U.S.C. § 6311(g)(2).  Under the NCLBA, “there are remedies\navailable to the Secretary of Education to take action against a federal fund recipient who\nfails to comply with legal requirements imposed by a federal education statute . . . .”\nACORN, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 342.  This is in stark contrast to the McKinney Act which\nlacks any federal enforcement provision or individual remedy.  \nThus, the McKinney Act, as previously held by Lampkin, evidences a clear and\nunambiguous intent of Congress to create individually enforceable rights.  The Act provides\nmandatory entitlements to homeless children by clear and precise direction to state and local\nofficials.  The statute obligates State and local agencies to perform in a specific way to\nensure that homeless children are provided an education on par with that of nonhomeless\nchildren.  Finally, the lack of an enforcement scheme indicates that Congress intended to\nconfer rights on a particular class of persons.  Consequently, the Plaintiffs can maintain an\naction under section 1983 to enforce provisions of the McKinney Act. \n2. The Equal Protection Clause\nThe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no\nstate shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  This is\n“essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313\n17\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 18 of 30 PageID #: 244\n(1985).  Plaintiffs in this case claim that homeless children in Suffolk County are not\nreceiving the same access to public school education enjoyed by nonhomeless children.  \nDiscriminatory treatment by the government is sufficient to trigger assessment under\nthe Equal Protection Clause.  See Lewis v. Thompson, 252 F.3d 567, 590 (2d Cir. 2001). \nIf government action interferes with a “fundamental right” or discriminates against a “suspect\nclass,” it must be reviewed using the strict scrutiny analysis.  Absent these circumstances,\ngovernment action will ordinarily survive an equal protection challenge so long as the action\nis rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,\n216–17, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982).  Further, in Plyler, the Supreme Court\nacknowledged that although public education is not a fundamental right granted to individuals\nby the Constitution, neither is it “merely some governmental ‘benefit’ indistinguishable from\nother forms of social welfare legislation.”  Id. at 221.  The Court reasoned that education\nwas so important to the American way of life and to the function of state and local\ngovernments that any denial of education must be justified by some “substantial goal” of the\nState.  Id. at 223–24.  This analysis amounts to a “heightened” or “intermediate scrutiny”\nwith respect to government action that results in deprivation.\nSince Plyler, the Supreme Court has declined to extend heightened scrutiny in regard\nto education beyond the “unique circumstances” of Plyler.  See Kadrmas v. Dickinson\nPublic Schools, 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1988) (holding that a\n18\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 19 of 30 PageID #: 245\npublic school district’s charging of a user fee for bus transportation to school did not violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause).  However, the Supreme Court implied that statutes which\ncreate circumstances that involve the penalization of children for the “illegal conduct of their\nparents” and risk significant and enduring adverse consequences to children should be\nreviewed using the Plyler rationale.  Id.   Indeed, the Second Circuit applied the rationale of\nPlyler when it ruled that the denial of eligibility for welfare benefits to children solely because\nof their mothers’ alien status violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Lewis v. Thompson, 252\nF.3d 567, 591 (2d Cir. 2001).  In determining the whether to apply heightened scrutiny, the\ncourt stated that the denial of public education would present an even more compelling case\nfor heightened scrutiny than the postponement of welfare benefits.\nIn the instant case, the circumstances are significantly similar to those in Plyler.  The\nPlaintiffs’ contend that homeless children in Suffolk Country are not receiving the same\naccess to public school education enjoyed by other children.  Thus, taking the Plaintiffs’\nfactual allegations as true, the Defendants appear to be penalizing these homeless children\nbecause of the misfortunes or misdeeds of their parents.  Further, in exacting the penalty, the\nState Defendants are risking significant and enduring adverse consequences to the children\nby denying them access to a public education.  On its face, the Plaintiffs’ warrants the\n“heightened scrutiny” standard set forth in Plyler. \nUnder heightened scrutiny review, the Plaintiffs are not required to negate any\n19\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 20 of 30 PageID #: 246\nreasonable conceivable set of facts that could provide any rational basis for the classification\nof the children, as required when utilizing rational basis review.  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala.\nv. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001).  In fact, the\nDefendants failed to assert even one rational basis for the homeless children transportation\nprocedures currently in place in Suffolk County.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have met their burden\nof stating a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, which may be enforced under section\n1983.  As such, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss Planitiffs’ cause of action for failing to\nassert a federal right under section 1983 is denied.\nB. Class Certification\nIn determining whether a putative class qualifies for certification, the only question is\nwhether the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 have been met.  See Eisen v. Carlisle &\nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177–78, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732, 94 S. Ct. 2140 (1974).  The Court\nassumes the allegations in the complaint to be true, and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove\nthat the putative class meets the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) and satisfies the\nrequirements of at least one of the categories enumerated in Rule 23(b).  See In re Visa\nCheck/Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 133 (2d Cir. 2001); Caridad v. Metro-\nNorth Commuter RR, 191 F.3d 283, 291 (2d Cir. 1999); Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d\n372, 374 (2d Cir. 1997); Vengurlekar v. Silverline Techs., Ltd., 220 F.R.D. 222, 226\n(S.D.N.Y. 2003).  \n20\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 21 of 30 PageID #: 247\nIn deciding certification, courts must take a liberal rather than a restrictive approach\nin determining whether the plaintiff satisfies these requirements and may exercise broad\ndiscretion in weighing the propriety of a putative class.  See In re NASDAQ Market -\nMakers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing Korn v. Franchard\nCorp., 456 F.2d 1206, 1208-09 (2d Cir. 1972)); see also Pecere v. Empire Blue Cross\nand Blue Shield, 194 F.R.D. 66, 69 (E.D.N.Y May 2000).  Whether the plaintiffs have\nstated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits is not a consideration for resolution of a\nmotion for class certification.  See Vengurlekar, 220 F.R.D. at 226.  While the district court\nmust engage in a “rigorous analysis” to establish whether the plaintiff has met its burden of\nproof as to certification, Caridad, 191 F.3d at 291, such a determination must not evolve\ninto a “preliminary inquiry into the merits.”  Eisen., 417 U.S. at 177.\nPlaintiffs seek certification of a class defined as follows:\nClass A: All school-aged children (as defined by New York State Education\nLaw) who, on or after September 1, 2001: (1) have lived, are living or will live\nin Suffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been, are, or\nwill be “homeless” as defined in the McKinney-Vento Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n11434A.\nand\nClass B: All parents, guardians or persons in a parental relationship for children\nin Class A, who, on or after September 1, 2001: (1) have lived, are living or\nwill live in Suffolk County, New York; and (2) during such period have been,\n21\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 22 of 30 PageID #: 248\nare, or will be “homeless” as defined in the McKinney-Vento Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 11434A.\nPls.’ Am. Compl. ¶ 117.\nIn support of class certification, the Plaintiffs set forth reports, which lead to the\ninference that missed school days are not unique to the Plaintiffs in this action.  The 2004-\n2006 Education of Homeless Children and Youth Program Report describes how pervasive\nthe problem is:\nThere are some school districts that have not grasped and/or acknowledged the\nlegality of the [McKinney Act].  Consequently the gaps that exist are the same\nas the gaps that existed prior to the authorization of the McKinney-Vento Act\ndue in part to the historical rise in the number  of  families  affected  by\nhomelessness  in  Suffolk  County.    These  gaps  include:  denials  of\nregistration/immediate attendance for school due to dispute of “homeless”\ndeclaration, lack of transportation back to the district of last attendance,\ninappropriate placement, no placement, lengthy gaps in the provision of services\nand/or placement, unfair disciplinary actions and poor, or no, access to support\nservices.  These gaps are reported in the daily requests for services received\nby the Social Worker responsible for the Suffolk County advocacy program\nvia the Homeless Children and Youth Grant.\nSimes Aff. Ex. A.\nPlaintiffs also allege that there are hundreds of children who are homeless throughout\nSuffolk County.  According to information from Suffolk County’s Joint Task Force on\nHomelessness, 2,300 people and an estimated 1,400 children were living in emergency\nhousing in November of 2002.  The actual number of homeless children living in Suffolk\nCounty is unknown.\n22\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 23 of 30 PageID #: 249\n1. Rule 23(a)\nTo qualify for class certification, the plaintiff must first prove that the putative class\nmeets the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a): \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims\nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, 280\nF.3d 124, 132-33 (2nd Cir. 2001).  \na. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1), generally referred to as the numerosity requirement, requires that the\nclass be “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a)(1).  “Impracticable,” in this context, is not to be confused with impossible.  Rule\n23(a)(1) only requires that, in the absence of a class action, joinder would be “difficult” or\n“inconvenient.”  Vengurlekar, 220 F.R.D. at 227 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n“Plaintiffs need not establish the precise number of potential class members since courts are\nempowered to make ‘common sense assumptions to support a finding of numerosity.’ ” \nNicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (quoting German v. Fed. Home\nLoan Mortgage Corp., 885 F. Supp. 537, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)).\n23\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 24 of 30 PageID #: 250\nThe Plaintiffs submit that some 2,300 residents of Suffolk County—including\napproximately 1,400 children—are homeless and live in emergency housing.  Indeed, the\nsubmissions of the Defendants confirm that the school districts deal with hundreds \nof homeless children on a daily basis.  But the Defendants argue that it would be practical for\nnumerous homeless plaintiffs to commence individual suits and then have them joined\nbecause the members of the prospective class are geographically confined to Suffolk\nCounty, New York.  This arguments lack any semblance of common sense or practicality.\nIn Koster v. Perales, the court noted that impracticability of joinder is “even more\npronounced” when the plaintiffs are homeless.  108 F.R.D. 46, 50 (E.D.N.Y. 1985)\n(certifying a class of homeless families who were challenging government policies). \n“[H]omeless families are frequently homeless for short periods of time; thus, the actual\nmembership of the class is in constant flux.”  Id.  Similarly in the instant  case, the economic\nstatus and transience of most of the potential class members makes individual suits next to\nimpossible.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs adequately satisfy the numerosity\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(1). \nb. Commonality \nThe commonality requirement set forth in Rule 23(a)(2) requires a showing that\ncommon issues of fact or law exist and that they affect all class members.  However, the\nindividual circumstances of the class members can differ without precluding class\n24\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 25 of 30 PageID #: 251\ncertification.  See Vengurlekar, 220 F.R.D. at 227.  “The critical inquiry is whether the\ncommon questions are at the core of the cause of action alleged.”  Id. (internal quotations\nand citations omitted).  Commonality is assumed where the plaintiffs seek declaratory relief\nas opposed to individual relief.  Port Authority Police Benev. Ass'n, Inc. v. Port Authority of\nNew York and New Jersey, 698 F.2d 150, 151 (2d Cir. 1983). The commonality element\nof Rule 23(a)(2) is considered a “minimal burden for a party to shoulder.”  Lewis Tree\nService, Inc., 211 F.R.D. 228, 231, (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2002).  \nHere, the Plaintiffs have common issues of fact and law that affect all class members. \nLegally, the Plaintiffs challenge the failure of the Defendants to satisfy statutory and\nconstitutional mandates to ensure homeless children are enrolled and transported to school. \nFactually, the Plaintiffs are similar in that they are all children who missed school in part due\nto the fact that they were homeless and were not enrolled in or provided adequate\ntransportation to and from school.  \nThe Defendants urge that the legal issue can only be decided on an individual basis\nbecause of the unique situation of each child.  However, individualized relief is not what the\nPlaintiffs seek.  The Plaintiffs are challenging how the practice and policy of the Defendants\naffects each individual child.  Furthermore, because the proposed class members seek to\nenjoin a practice or policy, rather than individualized relief, commonality is assumed.\n25\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 26 of 30 PageID #: 252\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have adequately proven the existence\nof common issues of fact and law among the putative class in satisfaction of the commonality\nrequirement in Rule 23(a)(2). \nc. Typicality \nRule 23(a)(3), also known as the typicality requirement, requires that “each class\nmember’s claims arise from the same course of events and [that] each class member makes\nsimilar legal arguments to prove [the] defendant’s liability.” Vengurlekar, 220 F.R.D. at 227.\n The typicality requirement is meant to ensure that the class representative is not subject to a\nunique defense which could potentially become the focus of the litigation.  See id.  “When it\nis alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff\nand the class sought to be represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective\nof minor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.”  Robidoux v. Celani,\n987 F.2d 931, 937 (2d Cir. 1993); see also Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 377 (holding that\nplaintiffs can meet the typicality requirement where “their injuries derive from a unitary\ncourse of conduct by a single system”).\nHere, the Plaintiffs’ central issue is whether the Defendants violated the McKinney-\nVento Act by failing to ensure that homeless children receive an education.  The Defendants\nreject the notion that the Plaintiffs are typical of the putative class by pointing out the\ndifferences among each plaintiff.  For example, the Defendants point out that one plaintiff has\n26\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 27 of 30 PageID #: 253\na psychiatric disability, another has attention deficit disorder, and another has emotional and\nsocial problems.  However, these differences are irrelevant to the central issue, namely, that\nthe Defendants are not ensuring transportation or enrollment of homeless children in school.\nThe Court notes that “typicality, a matter closely related to commonality, is satisfied\nwhen each class member’s claim arises from the same course of events and \neach class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”  In re\nFrontier Ins. Group, Inc. Securities Litigation, 172 F.R.D. 31, 40 (E.D.N.Y. 1997).  Here,\nthe putative class, including the Plaintiffs, put forth one claim based on the same set of facts,\nthat is whether the Defendants have violated the McKinney Act and the Constitution due to\nthe unfortunate fact of being homeless.  Thus, the plaintiffs have proven that “the claims of\nthe representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class” and thus, have\nadequately satisfied the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3).  \nd. Adequacy of Representation\nThe Defendants urge that the named plaintiffs cannot adequately represent the\ninterests of the class due to the individualized nature of their particular problems.  Rule\n23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.”  Rule 23(a)(4).  There is “no simple test for determining if a class will\nbe adequately represented by a named plaintiff” and “each case must be approached on an\nindividualized basis.”  In Re Lilco, 111 F.R.D. at 672.  In order to qualify, plaintiffs must\n27\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 28 of 30 PageID #: 254\n“demonstrate that there is no conflict of interest between the named plaintiffs and other\nmembers of the plaintiff class.”  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 378.\nDefendants’ contention, that the individualized problems of each plaintiff conflicts\nwith the interests of the potential members of the class is unavailing. Plaintiffs seek broad\nbased relief which would require the Defendants to ensure the education of homeless\nchildren.  In this regard, the interests of the class members are identical despite the\nindividualized problems of each plaintiff.\nDefendants also allege that one of the plaintiff’s families is no longer homeless, and\nthus cannot maintain standing in the action.  However, the Defendants do not explain how\nthis will cause a conflict of interest.  “[N]either a defense that may be asserted against a\nparticular plaintiff nor the possibility that a plaintiff's claim may become moot will necessarily\nbar members of the class from obtaining the relief they seek.”  Koster, 108 F.R.D. at 53\n(E.D.N.Y. 1985).  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have satisfied the\nadequacy of representation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4).\n2. Rule 23(b)(2) \nIn addition to satisfying the four prerequisites established in Rule 23(a), the plaintiff\nmust prove that the putative class is maintainable under at least one of the categories\nenumerated in Rule 23(b).  See In re Visa Check, 280 F. 3d at 133.  Here, the Plaintiffs\nrequest certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Under that rule, an action may be maintained as a\n28\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 29 of 30 PageID #: 255\nclass action when the “party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP.(b)(2).\nThe classic example of a class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is where a party\nseeks to declare a law unconstitutional.  Koster v. Perales,  108 F.R.D. 46, 54 (S.D.N.Y.\n1985).  Certification is also proper where a government entity refuses to comply with federal\nlaw.  Id.  Actions for injunctive relief will satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) if the relief\nsought will benefit the entire class. See Nicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 99 (E.D.N.Y.\n2001); see, e.g., Marisol I., 929 F. Supp. 662, 692 (S.D.N.Y.1996); see also Baby Neal\nex rel. Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1994) (suggesting that Rule 23(b)(2) “is\nalmost automatically satisfied in actions primarily seeking injunctive relief”).\nDefendants argue that certification under Rule 23(b) is improper due to the\nindividualized issues among the named Plaintiffs and the putative class members.  The Court\ndoes not agree that the issues of the Plaintiffs or the putative class are materially unique. \nPlaintiffs seek, through requested injunctive and declaratory relief, to remedy alleged\nsystem-wide abuses that potentially impact each and every homeless child in Suffolk\nCounty, New York.  In so far as the Plaintiffs ask for injunctive relief and predicate the\nlawsuit on the Defendants, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are satisfied.\n29\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 126   Filed 10/23/04   Page 30 of 30 PageID #: 256\nBecause the plaintiff has successfully fulfilled the requirements of Rule 23(a) and\nRule 23(b)(2), the Court holds that certification of the putative class is proper.  \nIII.     CONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, it is hereby\nORDERED, that the motion by the Defendants to dismiss this action pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is DENIED, and it is further\nORDERED, that the plaintiff’s motion for class certification pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23 is GRANTED in its entirety, and it is further\nORDERED, that the parties are directed to proceed with the bench trial,\ncommencing on October 27, 2004 at 9:00 a.m.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: Central Islip, New York\nOctober 23, 2004\n              s/ ARTHUR D.

The Compliance Report, while providing summary information, should be \nreasonably  complete  so  as  to  provide  the  Court  and  Plaintiffs'  counsel  with  an  accurate \nunderstanding of both OTDA's activities under this Consent Order and the current state of school \ntransportation of homeless students as provided by SCDSS. \n18.  In addition to the foregoing reporting, representatives from the OTDA Defendants \nshall communicate with Plaintiffs' counsel as appropriate to discuss any issues or trends relative \nto this Consent Order in the school transportation of homeless students which emerge over time. \nTraining and Other Provisions \n19.

Such trainings \nshall occur no less than once each year. \n20.

After the initial training set forth above, OTDA may provide training materials to \nbe incorporated into SCDSS's ongoing training programs.  This training will be coordinated with \nNYSED or school district training as appropriate. \n22.  OTDA, in consultation with the Plaintiffs, shall review the training programs and \nmaterials it provides to SCDSS as appropriate and shall promptly supplement and/or amend such \ntraining  and/or  training  materials  following  any  changes  or  amendments  to  pertinent  laws, \nregulations,  administrative  directives  or other requirements concerning the  manner in which \nSCDSS must transport homeless children to and from school. \n23.  During the regular reporting to the Court and Plaintiffs' counsel discussed above, \nOTDA shall provide summary information concerning dates and number of trainings, including \n10 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 11 of 33\nthe  number  of training  sessions,  the  approximate  number of attendees  and  any  changes  to \ntraining or training materials. \n24.  The OTDA Defendants shall consult with the Plaintiffs in good faith concerning \ntraining and training materials. \nIll.  0BLIGAT  IONS OF THE NY SED DEFENDANTS \nChanges to the Appeals Process \n25.  The  parties  agree  that  a  timely  and  efficient  appeals  process  is  important  in \npermitting a homeless child's or youth's parent or guardian or unaccompanied youth to exercise \nhis/her  right to  a  free,  appropriate  public  education.  Accordingly,  NYSED  has  revised  its \nappeals process pursuant to New York Education Law § 310 (the \"§ 310 appeal\" or \"appeal\") for \nappeals regarding a homeless child's or youth's access fo a free, appropriate public education as \nfollows: \na.  NYSED has (after an opportunity for consultation with Plaintiffs' counsel) \ncreated  a  form  petition  to  be  used  to  commence  appeals  regarding  a \nhomeless child's or youth's access to a free, appropriate public education. \nAmendments to Parts 275 and 276 and section 100.2(x) of the Regulations \nof the Commissioner of Education, relating to appeals regarding homeless \nchildren and youth were permanently adopted at the June 2005 Regents \nmeeting, effective date July 14, 2005.  The form petition is drafted in such \na manner as to be easy to complete, but asks for enough information about \nthe  parent's  or  guardian's  or  unaccompanied  youth's  complaint  as  to \nenable NYSED to consider the appeal fully.  The form petition is short and \neasily  understandable  by  persons  with  no  more  than  a  sixth  grade \neducation.  Where additional facts  and/or details are required, the form \npetition  includes  blank  lines  to  help  prompt the  petitioner to  add  the \npertinent information. \nb.  No  filing  fees  shall  be  required  for  appeals  brought  before  the \nCommissioner  of Education  regarding  a  homeless  child's  or  youth's \naccess to a free,  appropriate public education pursuant to  8 N.Y.C.R.R. \n§ 100.2(x). \nc.  The  homeless  petitioner's  petition  must  be  legible,  but  need  not  be \n. typewritten or notarized.  The homeless petitioner shall sign a statement \n11 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 12 of 33\nwhich  indicates  that  based  on  his/her  information  and  belief,  the \ninformation contained in the petition is true, and an acknowledgement that \nhe/she is aware that under New York Penal Law § 175.30, a person who \nknowingly offers a false  instrument for  filing  with  a public official or \npublic servant is guilty of Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the 2\"d \nDegree, a Class A Misdemeanor. \nd.  The NYSED Defendants shall require local educational agency liaisons \nfor homeless children and youths (\"homeless liaisons\") to assist homeless \nfamilies in filling out the form petition.  Upon completion of the petition, \nthe homeless liaisons shall provide homeless families with copies of the \npetition  and  any  supporting  documents,  without  cost  to  the  homeless \nfamilies.  The NYSED Defendants shall require the homeless liaisons to \neither accept service of the petition and any supporting papers on behalf of \nany  school district employee or officer named as a party or the school \ndistrict if it is named as a party or effect service by mail by mailing the \npetition and any supporting documents to any school district employee or \n· officer named as a party and, if the school district is named as a party, to a \nperson in the office of superintendent who has been designated by the \nboard of education to accept service on behalf of the school district.  The \nhomeless liaisons shall be required to provide the parent or guardian of a \nhomeless child or youth or unaccompanied youth with a signed and dated \nacknowledgement verifying that they have received the petition and any \nsupporting documents and either accepted service of these documents on \nbehalf of the school district employee or school district officer or school \ndistrict  or effected  service  by  mail  by  mailing  the  form  petition  and \nsupporting documents to any school district employee or school district \nofficer named as a party and, if the school district is named as a party, to a \nperson in the office of superintendent who has been designated by the \nboard of education to accept service on behalf of the school district.  The \nNYSED  Defendants  shall  direct  school  districts  to  maintain  sufficient \nsupplies of the petition and make the petition readily available to homeless \nfamilies. \ne.  The NYSED Defendants shall require the school district homeless liaisons \nto transmit on behalf of the parent or guardian of the homeless child or \nyouth  or  the  unaccompanied  youth  the  completed  petition  and  any \nsupporting documents to NYSED.  The homeless liaisons shall be required \nto provide the parent or guardian of the homeless child or youth or the \nunaccompanied youth with a signed and dated acknowledgement verifying \nthat the homeless liaisons have received the petition and any supporting \ndocuments and will transmit these documents to NY SED on behalf of the \nparent or guardian of the homeless child or youth or the unaccompanied \nyouth.  Homeless families will not be required to arrange for the filing of \nthe petition or any supporting documents with NYSED. \n12 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 13 of 33\nf.  Unless the homeless family or unaccompanied youth specifically requests \notherwise, the completed petition will be treated automatically as a request \nfor  temporary  stay,  entitling  the  homeless  student  to  the  requested \nenrollment and/or transportation pending resolution of the stay request. \nThe NYSED Defendants shall issue a ruling on the request for stay, if so \nrequired, in due course. \ng.  If a school district makes a final determination not to enroll or transport a \nhomeless  child or youth or unaccompanied  youth as requested  by  the \nparent or guardian or the unaccompanied youth, the school district shall \ndelay for thirty (30) days the implementation of that decision to give the \nhomeless family or unaccompanied youth time in which to commence an \nappeal to the Commissioner.  If the parent or guardian of a homeless child \nor youth or an unaccompanied youth commences a § 31 0 appeal regarding \nthe homeless child's or youth's of unaccompanied youth's access to a free, \nappropriate  public  education  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  such  final \ndetermination, the homeless child or youth or unaccompanied youth will \nbe able to attend the school in which enrollment is sought and/or obtain \nthe requested transportation until the Commissioner of Education renders \na decision on the stay application. \nh.  Preschool  children  and  children  who  are  rece1vmg  special  education \nservices  who  submit  a  §  310  appeal  in  connection  with  a  denial  of \ntransportation to or from school shall be entitled to interim transportation \npending the appeal processes noted above. \n1.  Disputes concerning whether a child is, in fact, homeless, shall be handled \nin the manner described in this section. \nj.  The  revised  petition  forms  described  above  shall  be  maintained  in \nsufficient quantities in each school. \n26.  The NYS  ED Defendants shall require school districts to maintain a written log of \nall appeals submitted by the parents or guardians of a homeless child or youth or unaccompanied \nyouth. \n27.  Once each six months in the first year after entry of this Consent Order, and once \nannually  thereafter,  the  NYSED  Defendants  shall  review  all  §  310  appeals  submitted  by \nhomeless families and shall summarize for the Court and Plaintiffs' counsel the number of cases, \ntypes of disputes and resolutions. \n13 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 14 of 33\n28.  The NYSED Defendants shall revise, amend or enact appropriate regulations and \ndirectives to effectuate the changes to the appeals process set forth above. \nData Collection and Analysis \n29.  The NY SED Defendants shall implement data collection and analysis initiatives, \nincluding a data collection  system called \"Liaisons  On-line Unified  Information  System for \nEvaluation\" (\"LOUISE\"), which is currently under evaluation by NYSED, as set forth below. \n30.  The NYSED Defendants shall review the performance of the LOUISE system in \nthe test districts in which it is currently being implemented and, based on its performance as a \ndata collection tool, shall roll out the LOUISE data collection tool as quickly as possible among \nthe fourteen School District Defendants, other high need districts and districts with fifty (50) or \nmore homeless families. \n31.  Data collection under the LOUISE system shall be reviewed and implemented \nwith the intent of including to the extent possible pertinent information concerning homeless \nfamilies,  and  not merely  information  concerning  school  districts'  specific  McKinney-Vento \nsubgrant activities.  The LOUISE system  shall  be  configured as  technologically possible to \ncollect a broad range of pertinent information concerning homeless education,  including the \nnumber and ages of homeless children within a district, the percentage of homeless children \nremaining  in  schools  of origin,  the  length  of any  enrollment  delays,  the  average  wait  for \ntransportation services, and the types of services provided to those children as well as attendance \nand performance  information where possible.  The system shall  be  implemented in such as \nmanner as to ensure the greatest accuracy and uniformity of data possible. \n32.  Appropriate  trainings  shall be made available to  homeless liaisons in  districts \nreporting data to LOUISE in the proper use of LOUISE and techniques to collect complete, \n14 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 15 of 33\naccurate and uniform data about homeless families, children, youths and unaccompanied youths \nin the school districts. \n33.  The NYSED Defendants shall conduct a periodic review of the LOUISE system \nto determine its efficacy and utility, as it is rolled out to the districts specified in paragraph 30 of \nthis Order. \n34.  In addition to LOUISE, NYSED shall employ other data collection methods to \nobtain data regarding issues involving the education of homeless students within Suffolk County \nand elsewhere in  New York State, for analysis  consistent with the paragraphs set forth below. \nThese data collection methods shall include self-monitoring forms, which NYSED has designed \n(with input and comments from Plaintiffs' counsel) and which shall be disseminated to the school \ndistricts  for  completion.  In addition, NYSED  shall  collect data concerning  homeless  families \nthrough the Basic Educational Data System (\"BEDS\") currently in use for all school districts. \n35.  The NYSED Defendants shall develop criteria for data analysis of the information \nobtained through LOUISE, BEDS and the self-monitoring forms and shall provide the same to \nPlaintiffs'  counsel for  comment and  suggestions as  soon as  possible.  The purpose of such \nanalysis will be to provide the parties with a more accurate picture of the status of homeless \neducation in Suffolk County and New York State, and to identify problems or instances of school \ndistricts' non-compliance with the Jaws and regulations pertaining to homeless education. \n36.  To the extent the information set forth below in this paragraph is not accurately \ncaptured by LOUISE, BEDS, the self-monitoring forms or other means, NYSED shall develop \ncriteria and/or protocols for a sample survey (which may be conducted concurrently with on-site \nreviews discussed below).  The sample survey shall be conducted with respect to a number of \n15 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 16 of 33\nschool districts  sufficient to  constitute a statistically significant sample of districts within the \nState of New York.  The sample survey will seek to assess, among other things: \na.  The number of homeless children enrolled by grade, etc.; \nb.  Attendance information, including any delays or gaps in attendance due to \nincomplete implementation of the McKinney-Vento Act or NY State law; \nc.  Performance information; \nd.  Transportation information; and \ne.  Other information concerning education of homeless children. \n37.  Plaintiffs'  counsel  shall  be  given  an  opportunity  to  offer  comments  and \nsuggestions to NYSED concerning the sample survey, its criteria and/or protocols. \n38.  The parties shall confer at least twice  a year during the term of this  Consent \nOrder, except in the event of an emergency, concerning data collection and analysis, and shall \nwork cooperatively to improve the methods by which the NYSED Defendants collect and assess \ninformation concerning homeless students in Suffolk County and New York State. \nMonitoring ofS  chool Districts \n39.  In addition to the data collection and analysis set forth above, and along with such \nother monitoring as  NYSED  deems  appropriate  and  warranted  under the  circumstances, the \nNYSED Defendants agree to perform the following monitoring of the school districts: \n40.  In  December  2004,  NYSED  conducted  on-site  reviews  for  compliance  with \nhomeless education laws and regulations of all fourteen School District Defendants and sixteen \nother  districts  with  significant  homeless  populations  (i.e.,  more  than  twenty-five  homeless \nstudents at any one time) such as New York City, Buffalo and Long Island and/or found  or \nsuspected to be not in compliance with such laws or regulations based on LOUISE or other data. \nA second round of on-site reviews, including the fourteen School District Defendants, shall take \n16 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 17 of 33\nplace no later than January 1, 2007, and may occur sooner if circumstances warrant or NYSED \ndeems it appropriate.  The NYSED Defendants shall conduct on-site reviews of other districts as \nwarranted,  based  on  issues  raised  by  LOUISE  and  other  data,  complaints  or  allegations \nconcerning non-compliance and the size and concentration of the homeless population in the \ndistricts at issue. \n41.  The NYSED Defendants have developed and shall maintain criteria and protocols \nfor on-site reviews, to be discussed with Plaintiffs' counsel.  These criteria will address, among \nother things: \na.  A review of the practices, procedures and programs of the school districts with \nrespect to enrollment and transportation of homeless children, and other aspects of \nhomeless  education  and  compliance  with the  McKinney-Vento  Act  and  New \nYork Education Law§ 3209. \nb.  An assessment of the accuracy and completeness of data or information provided \nto NYSED by the school districts, including a sampling of files to ensure such \naccuracy and completeness. \nc.  A review of attendance records  for  homeless children to  ensure that homeless \nchildren are receiving access to a free, appropriate public education comparable to \ntheir non-homeless  peers  and  to  ensure  school  districts'  compliance with the \nMcKinney-Vento Act, New York Education Law§ 3209 and related regulations. \nd.  An  assessment  of the  school  districts'  transportation  systems  for  homeless \nchildren to ensure that no undue delays are preventing homeless children from \nattending school or are resulting in unnecessary school absences. \ne.  An  assessment  of the  school  districts'  transportation  systems  for  homeless \nchildren to ensure that they are being provided with transportation to all activities \nfor which non-homeless children are provided with transportation. \n42.  In addition to the foregoing, the NYSED Defendants shall conduct a review of the \n§  31 0  appeal  forms  submitted  by  homeless  families,  as  set  forth  above,  to  determine  the \nexistence of any trends or issues and to assess whether any districts' practices, procedures or \nprograms  may  constitute barriers  or  obstacles to  the  education  of homeless  children.  The \nNYSED Defendants shall, as circumstances reasonably warrant, investigate any such districts to \n17 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 18 of 33\ndetermine whether any additional action, beyond the scope of the specific appeals reviewed, is \nnecessary or appropriate, and may follow up with appropriate trainings or plans for corrective \naction as warranted by the circumstances. \n43.  The  NYSED  Defendants  shall  conduct  periodic  reviews  and  assessments  of \nreferral forms received from the New York State Technical and Education Assistance Center for \nHomeless  Students (\"NYS-TEACHS\") or any  other Technical Assistance  Centers or similar \nentities or organizations as well as complaints received from the general public.  To the extent \nthat  NYSED  determines  that  such  referral  forms  or  complaints  reasonably  suggest  non \ncompliance by one or more school districts and that an investigation is appropriate, the NYSED \nDefendants shall promptly investigate the same, by on-site reviews or other appropriate means, \nto ensure compliance. \nEnforcement \n44.  The parties agree that the State has certain responsibilities in the enforcement of \nthe McKinney-Vento Act, New York Education Law § 3209 and related laws and regulations \nconcerning the education of homeless children.  Accordingly, along with such other enforcement \nactivities as NYSED deems appropriate and warranted under the circumstances, the NYSED \nDefendants agree to perform the following enforcement activities vis-it-vis the school districts: \n45.  The  Homeless  Education  Program  Manager  (or  the  State  Coordinator  for \nHomeless Education), under the supervision of an Associate Commissioner at NYSED, shall \nreceive, review and respond to copies of all referral forms from NYS-TEACHS or any other \nTechnical Assistance Center for homeless education or related entity or organization concerning \nproblems  as  to homeless children that could not be resolved  by NYS-TEACHS  or another \nTechnical Assistance Center.  The Program Manager (or State Coordinator) shall also receive \n18 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 19 of 33\nand respond to calls from other sources, including parents or guardians of homeless children, \nwhich involve allegations of homeless children missing any significant period of schooling. \n46.  The Program Manager (or State Coordinator) shall respond to each such referral \nor call  and shall  maintain a written lo~ of each such call  and the  response  or action taken \n(including the time and date received along with any follow up and disposition).  The Program \nManager  (or  State  Coordinator),  under  the  supervision  of an  Associate  Commissioner  of \nNYSED, shall determine the appropriate response to be taken under the circumstances, including \nbut not limited to consideration of the following: \na.  Providing a specific directive to the school district and/or the Technical \nCenter; \nb.  Sending a letter or warning to the school district in question; \nc.  Communicating with OTDA or SCDSS concerning any transportation or \nother social services issues; \nd.  Requesting further information from the school district or other interested \nparties; \ne.  Directing additional training of school personnel; \nf.  Referring the matter to the Associate Commissioner for appropriate action \nwhich may include: communication to the school district, recommending \nto the Commissioner of NYSED the removal  of an intransigent school \nsuperintendent, district superintendent, or school board member pursuant \nto N.Y. Education Law§ 306, threatening to withhold NCLB funding, or \nwithholding NCLB funding; and \ng.  Taking such other action as may be appropriate under the circumstances to \naddress and remedy any problems or issues with respect to the education \nof homeless children. \n47.  The  NYSED  Defendants,  within their Compliance Report,  shall  report to  the \nCourt and Plaintiffs' counsel concerning the number, nature, response and disposition to such \nrequests twice a year in the first year after entry of this Consent Order and once a year thereafter. \n19 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 20 of 33\n48.  The NYSED Defendants shall provide support to NYS-TEACHS or any other \nTechnical Assistance Centers under contract with NYSED to enforce the laws and regulations \nconcerning the education of homeless children as may be reasonably necessary. \n49.  The  NYSED  Defendants  shall  assess  the  feasibility  of opening  additional \nTechnical Assistance Centers for homeless education elsewhere in New York State. \nPublic Outreach \n50.  The  NYSED  Defendants  agree  that  they  will  take  reasonable  measures  to \nencourage  the  School  District  Defendants  and  the  SCDSS  Defendants  to  inform  homeless \nfamilies and unaccompanied youths in a timely manner of their right to receive services under \nthe McKinney-Vento Act and/or New York Education Law§ 3209, and to provide accurate and \ncomplete information to those children and their families about their rights and options to enable \nthem to obtain the services they need and/or desire.  Such reasonable measures will include, but \nare not limited to, the following: \n51.  The  NYSED  Defendants  agree  that  they  shall  make  available  in  sufficient \nquantities for each school district, social service locations, including but not limited to shelters, \nmotels,  libraries, public health centers and other public sites in Suffolk County as are agreed \nupon by the parties, a poster or posters in English and Spanish which the NYSED Defendants or \ntheir agents or contractors may have developed or in the future will develop advising parents and \nguardians of their children's rights under the McKinney-Vento Act and/or New York Education \nLaw § 3209 (the \"Poster\").  Such posters will include the hotline numbers for NYS-TEACHS or \nany other similar state contractor, and the National Center on Homeless Education.  The NYSED \nDefendants shall direct the school districts to make these Posters available in each of the School \nDistrict Defendants' schools and administration buildings and shall provider sufficient copies to \n20 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 21 of 33\npermit the Poster to be displayed in each runaway and youth shelter, in each homeless shelter \nand motel lobby in which SCDSS places homeless families, and in any other places agreed upon \nby the parties. \n52.  In  addition,  the NYSED  Defendants  agree  that they  shall  make  available  in \nreasonably sufficient quantities for each homeless family and unaccompanied youth in Suffolk \nCounty a brochure or brochures in English and Spanish as the State Defendants or their agents or \ncontractors may have developed or in the future will develop advising parents and guardians of \ntheir children's rights under the McKinney-Vento Act and/or New York Education Law§ 3209 \n(the \"Brochure\").  These Brochures shall be made available in all school districts' schools and \nadministration buildings, in each runaway and youth shelter, in each homeless shelter and motel \nlobby in which social services agencies place homeless families, and in any other places agreed \nupon by the parties. \n53.  An Associate Commissioner at NYSED shall, by letter or memorandum, instruct \nall  school  districts  to  display  the  homeless  education  Posters  prominently,  distribute  the \nhomeless education Brochures to homeless children and families, and maintain a supply of the \nBrochures in each school building where parents and guardians conduct communications with \nschool district personnel concerning enrollment, transportation or similar issues.  The SCDSS \nDefendants shall be required to display the Posters prominently and maintain a supply of the \nBrochures in SCDSS offices or other locations where homeless families go to receive benefits \nfrom SCDSS including without limitation shelters, soup kitchens, healthcare for the homeless \nsites and social services offices, including those providing emergency housing, other governrnent \nsupported housing, food stamps, and TANF. \n21 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 22 of 33\n54.  Upon any future revisions to the Brochure or Poster, the NYSED Defendants shall \nprovide an  advance  copy of the  same to  Plaintiffs'  counsel  to  permit Plaintiffs'  counsel  to \nprovide comments and suggestions.  The parties shall confer in good faith concerning any such \ncomments and suggestions. \n55.  The NYSED  Defendants  shall  provide additional  copies  of the  Brochure  and \nPoster to  all  school  districts  and  collaborate  with  the  school  districts,  OTDA  and  SCDSS \nregarding the distribution of the Brochure and Poster to shelters and other appropriate locations \nto be discussed among counsel, as available currently and upon any future printings. \n56.  The  NYSED  Defendants  shall  coordinate  efforts  with  the  School  District \nDefendants and the OTDA Defendants shall coordinate with the SCDSS Defendants to ensure \nthat the family of each homeless child receives the Brochure at the point at which they are first \nidentified as homeless, in the native language of the family, where available, or in English or \nSpanish, if not. \n.Training \n57.  The  parties  agree  that  providing  appropriate  services  to  homeless  children \nrequires  that  relevant  personnel  and  those  involved  in  enrolling  and  transporting  homeless \nchildren and youths understand the rights and needs of homeless children and have sufficient \nknowledge of homeless children's and unaccompanied youths' rights and needs sufficiently in \norder to be able to assist them.  Accordingly, the NYSED Defendants agree to make available \nappropriate and reasonable training to all school district or local social services agency personnel \nwho are likely to have contact with homeless children or their families  concerning homeless \nchildren's education, or who  are  responsible for  providing educational or related services to \n22 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 23 of 33\nhomeless children or families.  NYSED will collaborate with OTDA in development ofOIDA's \ntraining of local social services district personnel. \n58.  Among other things, as of February I, 2005, the NYSED Defendants conducted \ntwo-day  Professional  Development  Sessions  in  New  York  City,  Albany  and  Rochester \nconcerning  education  of homeless  children  and  data  collection.  All  homeless  liaisons  and \npertinent personnel from  SCDSS and others involved in transporting, enrolling and educating \nhomeless children were invited to attend.  The State Defendants, where permissible, required \nrepresentatives from school districts receiving funding under the McKinney-Vento Act to attend \none  of the  Professional Development Sessions.  The State Defendants otherwise encouraged \nappropriate  school  district  representatives  to  attend  one  of the  Professional  Development \nSessions. \n59.  In the above-mentioned training activity and others that the NYS  ED Defendants \nconduct or organize pertaining to educational services to be provided to homeless children and \nyouths, the NYSED Defendants will invite as appropriate national experts and others to provide \ninformation  concerning  \"best  practices\"  under  the  McKinney-Vento  Act  that  are  being \nimplemented outside of New York State. \n60.  The NYSED Defendants shall make available such additional training and support \nto school districts and invite local social service districts and agencies to participate in training \noffered either directly by NYSED or by NYS-TEACHS or another Technical Assistance Center \nunder contract with NYSED, as is necessary and appropriate. \n61.  Relevant NYSED staff shall be appropriately trained with respect to McKinney-\nVento Act and New York Education Law§ 3209 and shall attend seminars and conferences as \n23 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 24 of 33\nappropriate.  The NYSED Defendants shall keep a written record of such trainings including the \ndate, attendees and subject matters covered. \n62.  The  NYSED  Defendants  shall  provide  appropriate  training  regarding  the \nMcKinney-Vento Act and New York Education Law§ 3209, which shall be mandatory for those \nschool districts which receive McKinney-Vento funding.  The State Defendants will strongly \nencourage all School District Defendants to attend such training.  The NYSED Defendants shall \nkeep records with regard to the training of the school districts' homeless liaisons (including date, \nattendees and subject matters covered) to be shared with the Court and Plaintiffs' counsel during \nthe periodic reports the State Defendants will make as set forth in this Consent Order. \nReporting \n63.  The NYSED Defendants shall report to the  Court and Plaintiffs' counsel as set \nforth above. \n64.  In  addition  to  the  foregoing  reporting,  representatives  from  the  NYSED \nDefendants shall confer with Plaintiffs' counsel as appropriate during the meetings held pursuant \nto paragraph 42 herein to discuss any emerging issues or trends in the education of homeless \nstudents. \nIV.  COLLABORATION AMONG STATE DEFENDANTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES \n65.  In  addition  to  such  other  activities  as  the  State  Defendants  believe  to  be \nappropriate, the State Defendants agree to conduct the following collaboration and cooperation \nactivities: \n66.  The  NYSED  Defendants  shall  conduct  monthly  meetings  (and  additional \nmeetings as may be periodically needed) with the OTDA Defendants to increase communication \nand coordination concerning homeless education.  These monthly meetings shall be supported \n24 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 25 of 33\nand attended by  appropriate NYSED  personnel  and  the senior staff representative at OTDA \n(along with other relevant personnel) and will address the issues set forth in this Consent Order \nand will address any other issues relating to the access of homeless children and youths to a free, \nappropriate public education that the State Defendants reasonably deem to be pertinent.  NYSED \nAssociate Commissioner Evans-Tranumn shall attend all such monthly meetings for the first six \nmonths after the entry of this Order, bi-monthly for  the following  six months, and quarterly \nthereafter.  NYSED  personnel  in  attendance  at  the  meetings  will  report  to  Associate \nCommissioner Evans-Tranumn concerning those meetings she does not attend. \n67.  The NYSED Defendants and the OTDA Defendants shall regularly collaborate \nconcerning any problems or issues identified by OTDA as to SCDSS data and transportation \nsystems and shall work cooperatively to develop appropriate plans to remedy the same. \n68.  NYS-TEACHS  and any other Technical Assistance Center under contract with \nNY SED for the education of homeless children shall conduct (in collaboration with the NY SED \nDefendants)  yearly  informational  conferences  (in  addition to  such  other technical  assistance \nactivities as  are appropriate), and shall provide ongoing technical support to  school  districts, \nlocal social services districts and agencies, homeless liaisons and others. \n69.  The NYSED Defendants convened a statewide Homeless Advisory Committee \n(\"HAC\"), meeting on a quarterly basis in the first year after entry of the Order and as needed and \nat least twice per year after that.  The HAC consists of senior representatives ofNYSED, OTDA, \nunaccompanied youth programs, and other programs relating to or affecting homeless families. \nThe  HAC  is  chaired by  an  Associate Commissioner at NYSED and  shall  address  issues  of \nhomeless education with a particular focus on improving homeless children's and youths' access \nto a free, appropriate public education.  The HAC shall invite members from the legal services \n25 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 26 of 33\ncommunity and others involved in homeless education issues to discuss best practices, issues and \nconcerns as to homeless education in New York State.  The first HAC meeting was held on \nDecember 6, 2004. \n70.  The  Homeless  Education  Program  Manager  at  NYSED  has  been  in \ncommunication with the homeless liaison from each of the fourteen School District Defendants \nto coordinate such activities as are appropriate with respect to homeless education, including \nwithout limitation the implementation of consent orders in this matter and implementation of the \nrequirements  of the  McKinney-Vento  Act  and  New  York  Education  Law  §  3209.  Such \ncommunication shall  continue as determined by NYSED to  be appropriate to  effectuate the \nrequirements of the McKinney-Vento Act and New York education Law§ 3209. \n71.  Within thirty (30) days after the  entry of this  Consent  Order,  the  Compliance \nOfficer at OTDA shall contact the relevant personnel at SCDSS to initiate the data collection, \nmonitoring and enforcement procedures set forth in this Consent Order. \nV.  REVISION OF POLICIES \n72.  Within ninety (90) days of the  entry of this Order, the State Defendants shall \nrevise any policies, procedures, guidelines, directives or other documents to incorporate, reflect \nand/or communicate the terms of this Consent Order, as necessary. \n73.  The  parties  acknowledge  that  this  Consent  Order  does  not  prohibit  future \nregulatory action by the State Defendants based on changes in relevant law consistent with the \nprovisions of this Consent Order.  The parties acknowledge that should a change in federal or \nstate statutes or federal regulations occur that would render the State Defendants' performance \nhereunder unlawful or prohibited, or if federal or state statutes or federal regulations change such \nthat the State is required to change its laws or regulations to comply with or to be eligible for \n26 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 27 of 33\nMcKinney-Vento  funding,  the  State  Defendants  shall  notify  Plaintiffs'  counsel  prior  to \nimplementing any such change in law, and shall move before this Court on notice to Plaintiffs' \ncounsel  as  soon as  is  practicable to  seek to  amend  the provisions of the  Consent Order as \nappropriate.  If any provision of this Consent Order or the application thereof becomes or is held \ninvalid or unlawful, the other provisions or applications of the Agreement which can be given \neffect without the invalid or unlawful provisions or application shall be given effect, and to this \nend the provisions of this Consent Order are declared to be severable. \nVI.  MISCELLANEOUS \n74.  The parties shall confer in good faith to establish reasonable procedures to permit \nimmediate and direct communications for addressing any problems or concerns that may arise \nconcerning compliance with this Consent Order \n75.  The parties agree to  work together cooperatively to provide Plaintiffs'  counsel \nwith such information and documents as may be reasonably necessary to assess and evaluate the \nState Defendants' performance of the various obligations under this Order.  The parties shall \nwork together in  good  faith  with respect to  other documents  that may  be requested by the \nPlaintiffs'  counsel,  and the  Defendants shall make a good faith  effort to  provide reasonably \nrequested information on a prompt and expedited basis to the extent permitted under relevant \nlaws and regulations. \n76.  The State Defendants shall each submit a separate written Compliance Report to \nthe Court and to Plaintiffs'  counsel once each six months in the first year after entry of this \nConsent Order, and once annually thereafter.  Each Complian<;e Report will detail each State \nagency's  activities  and  expenditures  in  connection  with  this  Consent Order and  such  other \nactivities NYSED and/or OTDA may have taken to monitor the education and/or transportation \n27 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 150    Filed 03/31/06   Page 28 of 33\nof homeless children and any enforcement action or actions taken.

Relevant school personnel will be instructed to report any complaints concerning \nthe  provJslOn  of educational  services  to  homeless  children  to  the  Homeless  Liaison.  The \nHomeless Liaison will record all such complaints in a single location, organized chronologically. \nRevision of Existing Enrollment and Withdrawal Forms \n21.  The  School  District Defendants  shall  revise  their school  enrollment or school \nwithdrawal forms  to  include a place on such forms to  inquire ( 1) whether the  enrollment or \nwithdrawal of a student is related to homelessness or a loss of permanent housing, and, if so, the \ndate of last attendance and (2) whether any services (such as transportation) are being requested \nof the school district.  The School District Defendants will provide homeless families assistance \nin filling out such forms along with a copy of the brochure referenced above. \n22.

Upon filling out the newly revised enrollment/withdrawal forms and soliciting a \nresponse  indicative of homelessness,  school  personnel  (under the supervision/direction of the \nHomeless  Liaison  and/or  School  Designee)  shall  consulr  with  the  parent,  guardian  or \nUnaccompanied Youth concerning choice of school and transportation and shall assist the parent, \nguardian or Unaccompanied Youth to record his or her choices and requests for services on the \nenrollment form.  The parent, guardian or Unaccompanied Youth shall be given a copy of all \ncompleted forms, any brochures or other materials provided by the State Defendants concerning \nthe education of homeless children, and information conceming the right to appeal any decision \nmade  by  the  School  District  Defendants  as  to  the  education  of a  homeless  student.  Upon \ncompletion of any enrollment, withdrawal or ST AC forms, a copy will immediately be provided \nto the Homeless Liaison of the school district.  The Homeless Liaison will ensure that the school \npers01mel responsible for providing relevant services will be promptly notified of the services to \nbe provided or arrangements to be made with respect to the homeless child.  While services are \nbeing arranged for such a child, the child will immediately be enrolled by the school district. \nThe  School  District  Defendants  will  provide  homeless  children  with  access  to  appropriate \nservices under Title L Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  as required by \nlaw. \n~_~) ,  When a homeless child enrolls within a school district, the school district will \nimmediately request  school records  and  other documents  needed from  the  school district the \nhomeless child previously attended.

If a completed form indicates that a student's enrollment or withdrawal is a result \nof homelessness, or if a school otherwise identifies a homeless student, school personnel will \npromptly  inform  the  Homeless  Liaison.  As  for  each  such  student,  school  persmmel  shall \nimmediately inform the student and his/her parent or guardian both orally and in writing (in clear \nand concise terms capable of being easily comprehended, and if possible, in the language of the \nparent or guardian) of their rights under the McKi1mey-Vento Act and New York Education Law \n§ 3209, including without limitation: \na.  lnfom1ation  about  choice  of  schools  and  how  parents  or  guardians  or \nUnaccompanied Youth can exercise that choice. \nb.  The availability of transportation, how to obtain it and from whom to obtain it.  If \ntransportation  is  to  be  provided  by  the  School  District  Defendants,  school \npersonnel  or  homeless  liaison  shall  assist  in  making  arrangements  for \ntransportation. \nc.  Enrollment issues, including how to enroll, and the right of homeless children to \nbe enrolled immediately regardless of the availability of the customarily required \npaperwork. \nd.

A  description of the  services available to  homeless  children,  from  whom such \nservices  are  available,  and  how  to  obtain  access  to  such  services,  including \npreschool services and extra-curricular activities, and information as to whom the \nstudent/parent should notify if they wish to pmiicipate in these programs \nf.  The right to  appeal  a denial  of services or other adverse actions and how m1d \nwhere the right to appeal may be exercised. \ng.  Contact information for other resources for homeless families, including without \nlimitation  the  Homeless  Liaison,  NYS-TEACHS,  local  Department  of Social \nServices and low cost or free legal services providers' contacts. \n-10-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 12 of 38\n27.  The  School  District  Defendant  identifying  a  homeless  child  shall  inform  the \nparent guardian or Unaccompanied Youth that services may be available from SCDSS and other \ncommunity  agencies  and  of their  right  to  apply  for  assistance  and  how  to  obtain  further \ninformation. \n28.  The  School  District  Defendants  shall  take  reasonable  steps  to  protect  the \nconfidentiality  and  privacy  of homeless  families  and  shall  take  reasonable  steps  to  prevent \nagainst disclosing to persons outside the school district that a family or child is homeless. \n29.  The School District Defendants shall honor homeless students' rights under the \nMcKinney-Vento Act, New York Education Law § 3209 and the regulations of the New York \nState Commissioner of Education (the \"Commissioner\"), including the rights (1) to attend their \nschool of origin for the duration of homelessness and until the end of any school year in which \nthey  find  permanent  housing;  (2)  to  enroll  in  school  (including  attending  classes  and \nparticipating fully  in school activities where the  School District had reasonable notice and an \nopportunity to plan for such participation immediately), even if the homeless student lacks any or \nall  documentation typically required of students; (3) to be assisted in obtaining immunization \nrecords; (4) to have the enrolling school make prompt efforts to obtain previous school records; \nand (5) to be enrolled in school programs available to children who are not homeless. \nIV.  TRANSPORTATION OF HOMELESS CHILDREN \n30.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that transportation poses a particular difficulty \nfor  homeless  families  and  Unaccompanied  Youth  and  is  essential to  ensuring that homeless \nchildren receive  the  educational services to  which they are  entitled.  As  a result, the School \nDistrict Defendants  agree  that  they  will  make  all  reasonable  efforts to  ensure that  homeless \nchildren who are entitled to receive transportation services from the School District to and from \n-11-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 13 of 38\nschool (and/or any preschool, summer school or after or before school activities to which non-\nhomeless children are provided transportation) each day. \n31.  The Parties agree that the goal is to provide transportation each day, without gaps \nor pauses, such that there is as little disruption as practicable to the homeless child's education. \nPolicies and procedures that affect the transportation of homeless children or make it likely that a \nhomeless child might miss school shall be reviewed and revised as necessary.  Where it is not \npossible for a school district to provide transportation for a homeless child each and every day, \nthe goal will be to minimize any loss of school to the extent possible and provide transpm1ation \nas soon as possible. \n32.  For  those  homeless  children  whom  the  School  District  Defendants  have  the \nobligation to  transport to  school,  the School District Defendants will make every reasonable \neffort  to  provide  continuous  bus  transportation  without  delay  upon  receipt  of information \nidentifying the location for which transportation is to be provided once a child is identified as \nhomeless.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  School  n1strict  Defendants  shall  provide \ntransportation within the timeframe as follows for each new homeless child emolling within the \nSchool District: \na.  For students located within the boundaries of the school district and attending the \ndistrict's schools, no longer than two (2) consecutive school days, exclusive of the \ndate the  child is identified as homeless; \nb.  For students located within the boundaries of the school district and attending an \nout-of-district school, no longer than three (3) consecutive school days, exclusive \nof the date the child is identified as homeless; \nc.  For  students  who  live  outside  the  boundaries  of the  school  district  and  are \nattending the district's schools and/or an out-of-district school,  no  longer than \nthree (3) consecutive school days, exclusive of the date the child is identified as \nhomeless. \n-12-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 14 of 38\n33.  The failure of a School District Defendant to provide transportation to a homeless \nchild within the timeframe set forth above will not be deemed a violation of this Order to the \nextent that the School District Defendant has taken appropriate, reasonable and good faith steps \nto  establish transportation  within the timeframe  set forth  above  and that the  School  District \nDefendant has made a good faith and reasonable effort, in cooperation with the parent/guardian \nof the homeless child to the extent possible, to resolve the transportation delay.  The Parties \nagree that if a School District Defendant is repeatedly unable to establish timely transportation \nfor a homeless child, counsel for the parties will confer in an attempt to address the problem, and \nmay submit the matter to the Court if good faith, informal discussions are unable to achieve a \nresolution. \n34.  In providing transportation for homeless children, the School District Defendants \nshall ensure that such transportation arrangements accommodate homeless children's entitlement \nto  participate  in  any  preschool,  free  meal  or  similar  programs,  and  after  or  before  school \nactivities and extra-curricular events of which the School District had reasonable notice and an \nopportunity to plan for participation, where the School District Defendants provide transportation \nto such events or programs to children who are not homeless. \n35.  The School District Defendants shall take all necessary and reasonable measures \nto avoid any disruption in the transportation of homeless children for which the School District is \nresponsible.  The School District Defendants shall take reasonable safeguards to avoid disruption \nof service,  including  all  reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that  homeless  school  children  receive \ntransportation on delayed-opening and/or early dismissal school days.  (The parties recognize \nthat there may  be circumstances in which it  is not practical  to  transport a homeless child to \nschool  on a delayed-opening school day,  pmiicularly where a  child's trip  is  lengthy and the \n-13-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 15 of 38\nschool day is particularly shortened.  The School District Defendants will take reasonable steps \nto ensure that homeless children receive access to transportation services.) The School District \nDefendants shall also communicate with the homeless child and the homeless child's parent or \nguardian  (and, if appropriate, the family's case worker, shelter personnel or SCDSS personnel) \nconcerning any anticipated transportation problems or difficulties. \n36.  Any disruptions in the transportation of a child identified as homeless by a school \ndistrict shall be reported promptly to the Homeless Liaison.  lf a homeless child is absent from \nschool for more than three consecutive school days, because of transportation issues caused by \nthe school district, the school personnel will report the absence to the Homeless Liaison, who \nwill  inquire  into the  housing arrangements of the  student and confirm the child's temporary \naddress  and  telephone  number  where  possible.  The  Home.less  Liaison  will  document  such \nabsences and inquiries. \n3 7.  If a dispute arises over school selection, school enrollment, records requirements \nor  transportation  of a  homeless  child,  or  whether  a child  is  homeless,  the  School  District \nDefendant shall  provide the parent or guardian of the  child with a written explanation of the \nschool  district's  decision  in  the  home  language  of the  parent  or  guardian  where  possible, \nincluding the rights of the parent,  guardian or Unaccompanied Youth to  appeal the decision. \nCopies  of any  such  written  explanations  shall  be  retained ,by  the  Homeless  Liaison.  The \nexplanation should be written in clear and concise terms capable of being easily comprehended. \nThe Homeless Liaison will review each denial of, or substantial change in, transportation for a \nhomeless child to ensure compliance with this Order, and governing law and regulations.  The \nHomeless Liaison will maintain files concerning inquiries, complaints, denials of or changes to \ntransportation in a single location organized by student name. \n-14-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 16 of 38\n38.  If a homeless child is  absent from  or late to  school as  a result of problems in \ntransportation not the fault of the child or child's family, the School District Defendant shall not \ntreat the absence or lateness as unexcused and the absence shall not under any circumstances be \ncounted towards a denial of credit for the child, but the School District may require the student to \nmake  up  the  missed  work  to  achieve  the  credit  provided  that  the  School  District  provide \nreasonable opportunities for the student to do so. \n3 9.  If a homeless child is absent from school  as a result of a lack of transportation \ncaused by the school district which exceeds three school days, the School District Defendants \nshall  make  the  necessary  arrangements  to  have  school  assignments,  homework  and  other \nnecessary material  provided to the  homeless  student.  The  School  District Defendants shall, \nwhere it has failed or neglected to provide transpmiation to a homeless child for more than three \nconsecutive  school  days,  also  provide  appropriate  compensatory  educational  services.  For \nelementary students who miss school, one hour of one-on-one instruction shall be provided to the \nstudent for each day missed beginning on the fourth day out of school.  For secondary school \nstudents, two hours per day of one-on-one instruction shall be provided to the student for each \nday of school missed beginning on the fourth day out of school.  The school district shall take \ninto account that for many homeless students, instruction may not be appropriate at the location \nwhere the child is living and that alternate locations should be arranged and that transportation \nmay  not  be  available  from  the  child's  parents.  The  School  District  will  arrange  for  any \ncompensatory services in a reasonable time and place given the particular circumstances of the \nhomeless child. \nEducation of Homeless Students With Disabilities \n40.  Where  a  homeless  child  has  been  determined  to  have  a  disability  under  the \nIndividuals  with  Disabilities  Education Act  (\"IDEA\"),  20  U.S.C.  §§  1400-1487,  the  School \n-15-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 17 of 38\nDistrict Defendant in which the homeless child is enrolled will promptly implement the student's \nexisting individualized education plan (IEP) or a comparable program during the applicable re \nevaluation period. \n41.  Until the homeless child's IEP is implemented or reevaluated, the homeless child \nwill immediately be enrolled in the school district and will have the right to receive educational \nservices in a setting most similar to the placement indicated on the child's IEP.  If the child is \nreceiving  educational  services  in  an  out-of-district  setting  within  fifty  miles  of the  child's \nresidence, the school district shall continue the child in that placement unless there is an in \nschool district program to which the School District and the parent or guardian agrees.  The \nSchool District Defendants agree to provide transportation as set fmih above.  Except as required \nby law. or agreement by the parent/guardian and the school district, no homeless child with a \ndisability shall be placed on home instruction upon enrollment unless it is  determined by the \nCSE and indicated in the IEP that home instruction is the appropriate educational setting for the \nchild. \n42.  If such a student has no IEP, or if a homeless student is suspected of having a \ndisability, the School District will promptly evaluate or reevaluate the student in compliance with \nthe  IDEA  and  all  applicable  federal  and  state  laws  and  regulations.  The  School  District \nDefendants  will  make  reasonable  efforts  to  utilize  recent  evaluations  from  previous  school \nsettings in developing an initial IEP, where permitted by law and regulation.  While any such \nevaluation is taking place, the homeless child will be educated .tn accordance with the preceding \nparagraph. \n-16-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 18 of 38\nV.  COORDINATION AMONG DEFENDANTS \n43.  The Parties agree and acknowledge that coordination among the State, County \nand  local  authorities  responsible  for  providing  educational  services  to  homeless  children  is \nessential to  ensuring that homeless children enroii in and stay in school.  The School District \nDefendants therefore agree that they wi11 coordinate, communicate and collaborate on a regular \nbasis as to each homeless child within their care to ensure that all such children have access to ail \nof the educational services to which they are entitled under the relevant laws and regulations. \n44.  The Homeless Liaison from each of the School District Defendants will initiate \ncontact telephonica11y or in person with the Commissioner of SCDSS or his or her designee at \nleast twice each school year (once per semester) to discuss any problems or issues concerning the \neducation  of homeless  children  if such  problems  or  issues  exist,  including,  for  example, \ntransportation,  maintaining students in their school of origin, and provision of information to \nhomeless families.  The Homeless Liaison wi11 record the time and date of each such conference \nand any problems or issues identified, and will retain the record of each such conference with the \nother documents the Homeless Liaison is required to maintain under this Order. \n45.  The  Homeless  Liaison  from  each  of  the  School  District  Defendants  will \ncoordinate with personnel from  the  State Defendants to  the  extent necessary and possible to \nensure compliance with the McKinney-Vento Act, New York Education Law § 3209 and any \nConsent orders or other orders or judgments in this lawsuit. \nVI.  APPEALS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n46.  The Parties recognize and agree that any and all disputes concerning or relating to \nthe education of homeless children must be resolved as expeditiously as possible.  The Parties \nfurther  recognize  and  agree that  identified homeless children and  Unaccompanied  Youth are \n-17-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 19 of 38\nentitled, until the final resolution of any dispute or appeal concerning the enrollment of homeless \nchildren to immediate and continuing admission and enrollment in the school district in which \nenrollment  is  sought  pursuant  to  the  McKinney-Vento  Act  and  New  York  Education  Law \n~ 3209.  The Homeless Liaison of the school district will provide such assistance to the homeless \nchild and his or her parent or guardian as is reasonable.  The School District Defendants will \ncomply with their obligations under the McKinney-Vento Act, New York Education Law § 3209 \nand  the  IDEA as  to  homeless children disputing enrollment or transportation issues with the \nschool district.  The District shall act in good faith in making such identification of homelessness \nas set forth in McKinney-Vento, New York Education Law § 3209 and the regulations of the \nCommissioner.  The  parties  agree that following  any order or judgment in  this  lawsuit that \naffects the appeals or review process applicable to homeless children in New York State, counsel \nfor the parties will promptly confer to ensure that this Consent Order conforms to such appeals or \nreview process and the parties will promptly seek such modifications to this paragraph as may be \nbecome appropriate or necessary in light of the orders or judgments of the Court. \n4 7.  If the parent or guardian of a homeless child or Unaccompanied Youth disputes a \ndecision  about  enrollment,  transportation  or  other  matters  pertaining  to  the  educational \nplacement  of the  homeless  child  (including  a  school  district's  decision  that  a  child  is  not \nhomeless), the  School District Defendants will expeditiously and  fully  inform such parent or \nguardian or Unaccompanied Youth of their rights under the McKinney-Vento Act, New York \nEducation Law ~ 3209, the regulations of the Commissioner, New York Education Law § 310 \nand  the  regulations of the  Commissioner for  filing  an  appeal  and  this  Consent Order in the \nlanguage of the parent or guardian, if possible. \n-18-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 20 of 38\n48.  If a school district denies enrollment to a child who is asserted to be homeless  the \n' \nSchool  District  Defendants will  provide to  the  parent,  guardian or Unaccompanied  Youth a \nwritten explanation of the district's decision denying enrollment and  shall,  with such written \nexplanation, provide an informational packet to the parent, guardian or Unaccompanied Youth \nsetting forth the rights of homeless families to appeal the decision of the school district along \nwith pertinent contact information for assistance.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs and School District \nDefendants will work together in good faith to compile the informational packet to be provided \nto homeless families upon the denial of enrollment. \n49.  The  School  District  Defendants  will  expeditiously  follow  all  procedures  for \nappeal set forth by the New York State Education Department and any procedures set forth in \nany Consent Orders or orders or judgments of the Court in this lawsuit. \n50.

TRAINING OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL \n51.  The  Parties  agree  that  providing  appropriate  serv1ces  to  homeless  children \nrequires that relevant personnel at the schools (including the Homeless Liaison, administrators \nand  others  who  deal  with  homeless  children)  understand  the  rights  and  needs  of homeless \nchildren and have sufficient knowledge of homeless children's rights and needs to be able to help \nthem.  Accordingly,  the  School  District  Defendants  agree  that  they,  in  coordination  and \nconjunction  with  NYS-TEACHS  (or other agency  contracted  by state  defendants to  provide \n-19-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-00705-ADS-ARL   Document 133    Filed 10/07/04   Page 21 of 38\ntraining)  and  the  State  Defendants,  will  provide  and/or  require  appropriate  and  reasonable \ntraining to all relevant personnel who are likely to have contact with homeless children or their \nfamilies  concerning  homeless  children's  education,  or  who  are  responsible  for  providing \neducational or related services to homeless children or families. \n52.  The School District Defendants shall educate all relevant personnel at the School \nDistrict Defendants concerning the following: (i) the causes and effects of homelessness; (ii) the \neducational  and ~other needs  of homeless  children;  (iii)  the  rights  of homeless  children and \nobligations of the school districts under the McKi1mey-Vento Act, New York Education Law \n§ 3209 and any regulations thereunder; (iv) proper use of the various forms for identifying and \nproviding  services  to  homeless  children;  (v)  the  nature  and  scope  of services  available  for \nhomeless children, both within the school district and without; (vi) the identification of homeless \nchildren;  (vii)  the importance  of a mechanism for  coordinating with SCDSS  concerning the \nneeds of homeless children; (viii) the pariicular educational, social and emotional difficulties and \nchallenges faced by homeless children; (ix) the definition ofhomelessness; and (x) the particular \nneeds  of Unaccompanied  Youth.
