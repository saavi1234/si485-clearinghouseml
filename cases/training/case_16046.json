    "summary": "<p>Plaintiff, an Alabama attorney, filed suit on June 21, 2005, in Montgomery County Circuit Court against the State Comptroller after Plaintiff was denied payment for overhead hours he spent on indigent representation. Plaintiff was denied payment after the State Comptroller began withholding overhead payments for all indigent representation by lawyers appointed under Alabama Code § 15-12-21, providing for appointment and compensation of court-appointed trial counsel. These overhead payments were set at $30/hour.</p><p>The Comptroller's action withholding hourly overhead payments was based on a February 2005 Opinion of the Attorney General. In that opinion, the Attorney General found that pursuant to a 1999 amendment, Alabama Code § 15-12-21 did not permit hourly overhead payments despite the fact that such payments were the practice and understanding of lawyers, the Comptroller, and the courts for many years. </p><p>Plaintiff alleged that the Comptroller's action and the Attorney General opinion represented a mistaken interpretation of state law. Plaintiff also alleged that the issue of overhead had already been decided adversely to the Comptroller in a 2002 judgment out of Covington County Circuit Court. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, which would require the Comptroller to resume overhead payments and to refund all back payments withheld, certify a class consisting of all lawyers similarly affected, and pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The trial court entered a final judgment on September 26, 2005, (amended on September 28, 2005) directing restoration of overhead payments on a statewide basis, but declining to address the other issues of interest and class certification, and declining to award attorney's fees. </p><p>Plaintiff filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on October 11, 2005. The trial court denied Plaintiff's motion on October 14, 2005, and Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on October 28, 2005. Plaintiff also requested a partial stay of the order directing refunds in order to secure a source of payment of attorney's fees if so ordered, which was denied. Shortly thereafter, the Comptroller filed a cross-appeal challenging the trial court's decision. </p><p>On December 22, 2006, Justice Michael F. Bolin of the Alabama Supreme Court issued an opinion holding that Alabama Code § 15-12-21 provided for payment of office-overhead expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of an indigent defendant. However, the court did not reach the issues presented by Plaintiff on appeal (including class certification and attorneys fees) because those issues remain pending before the trial court. The clearinghouse was unable to find additional information on this case, and the case is presumably closed.</p>",

Van Heest, LLC\nPost Office Box 4026\nMontgomery, Alabama  36103-4026\n334-263-3551\n2\n\nMOTION OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE \nLAWYERS AND THE ALABAMA CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS \nASSOCIATION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF\nIn  accordance  with  Ala.  R.  App.  P.  29,  the  National\nAssociation  of  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  and  the  Alabama\nCriminal Defense Lawyers Association move the Court for leave\nto file an amicus curiae brief in support of Cross-Appellee\nDaniel  Wright,  limited  to  the  issue  of  the  trial  court’s\naction directing the Alabama Comptroller to resume statewide\npayments of office overhead expenses and to pay all withheld\noverhead payments to lawyers who represent clients determined\nto be indigent.  A description of the interests of the amicus\ncuriae follows.\nThe  National  Association  of  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers\n(“NACDL”)  is  a  non-profit  corporation  with  a  subscribed\nmembership  of  more  than  13,000  national  members  including\nprivate  practitioners,  public  defenders,  military  defense\ncounsel and law professors, and an additional 35,000 state,\nlocal and international affiliate members.  The American Bar\nAssociation  recognizes  NACDL  as  one  of  its  affiliate\norganizations and awards it full representation in its House\nof Delegates.\nThe  NACDL  was  founded  in  1958  to  promote  study  and\n3\n\nresearch  in  the  field  of  criminal  law;  to  disseminate  and\nadvance knowledge of the law in the area of criminal practice;\nand to encourage the integrity, independence and expertise of\ndefense  lawyers  in  criminal  cases.    Among  the  NACDL’s\nobjectives are ensuring justice and due process for persons\naccused of crime, promoting the proper and fair administration\nof criminal justice and preserving, protecting and defending\nboth the adversary system and the United States Constitution.\nThe NACDL’s interest in this case is two-fold.  First,\nNACDL participated as amicus curiae in May v. State, 672 So.2d\n1307  (Ala.  Crim.  App.  1993),  the  decision  which  held  that\ncounsel’s office overhead was a component of expenses incurred\nin  representing  accused  indigents  and  believes  in  the\nsoundness of that decision.  Second, NACDL maintains, as does\nits  state  affiliate  and  fellow  amicus  curiae,  that  the\nunilateral  cessation  of  the  payment  of  office  overhead\nexpenses was not supported by law.\nThe  Alabama  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  Association\n(“ACDLA”) is a non-profit organization of nearly 600 lawyers\nwho actively engage in the representation of those accused of\nviolating criminal laws.  Since 1981 the ACDLA, an affiliate\norganization of the NACDL, has served an important role in\n4\n\nadvocating for improvements in the criminal justice system in\nAlabama  and  has  had  members  participate  on  a  variety  of\ncommittees, task forces and commissions which, over time, have\nbeen  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  examining  various\naspects of the criminal justice system.  A large majority of\nthe ACDLA’s members represent indigent clients in criminal\ncases in the district, circuit and juvenile courts, as well as\nin appeals and in post conviction proceedings.  The action of\nthe Comptroller in suspending the payment of approved office\noverhead  expenses  for  the  representation  of  indigent\ndefendants  has  directly  impacted  a  large  portion  of  ACDLA\nmembers who are private lawyers functioning as counsel for\nindigent counsel under direct court appointment.  The ACDLA\nalso participated as amicus curiae in May v. State.\nThe  disposition  of  this  appeal  has  substantial\nimplications  for  NACDL  members  within  Alabama  and  for  the\nmembership of ACDLA.  The outcome will affect the criminal\njustice system in Alabama, a system in which NACDL and ACDLA\nmembers have a keen interest, and will have a direct impact\nupon the economic interests of many Alabama criminal defense\nlawyers.\nAs provided by Ala. R. App. P. 29, the NACDL and ACDLA\n5\n\nherewith conditionally file their brief as amicus curiae.\n_____________________________________\nStephen R.

Since amicus\ncuriae believe that oral argument will martially aid the Court\nin  its  disposition  of  the  present  case,  oral  argument  is\nrequested.  \n2\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStatement Regarding Oral Argument . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nTable of Contents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nTable of Authorities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\nSummary of the Argument . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\nArgument . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\nI.

Although the Comptroller pursued a position in this\nlitigation that was consistent with a position taken in 2002\nlitigation, the position taken in the earlier litigation was\nabandoned when he declined to appeal the  adverse ruling in\nthe Circuit Court of Covington County.  The inconsistency is\nfurther illustrated by the Comptroller’s agreement to continue\nto  pay  attorneys  in  Covington  County  for  approved  office\noverhead expenses in indigent defense cases, notwithstanding\nhis  refusal  to  pay  attorneys  for  approved  office  overhead\nexpenses in any other judicial circuit.  \nIn  taking  the  inconsistent  positions,  the  Comptroller\nseeks to impose a determent that is unfair upon the cross-\nappellee since that position, if adopted, would prevent Mr.\nWright (and other attorneys outside of Covington County) from\nbeing reimbursed for approved office overhead expenses.  If\nthe Court determines that judicial estoppel is inapplicable,\ncollateral estoppel applies to bar the Comptroller from taking\na position different from that established by the litigation\nin the Circuit Court of Covington County.  Collateral estoppel\n6\n\nrequires  that  the  party  claiming  the  benefit  of  a  prior\njudgment be one who would have been adversely affected by a\ncontrary  decision  in  the  earlier  case  and  that  the  party\nagainst  whom  collateral  estoppel  is  sought  to  be  applied\neither was an actual party in the earlier case, was in privity\nwith the party, or is a successor to the rights of a party in\nthe earlier case.  Both elements are shown in the instant case\nsince  Mr.  Wright  would  have  been  prejudiced  by  an  adverse\nruling in the Circuit Court of Covington County and the party\nagainst whom collateral estoppel is sought to be applied, the\nComptroller, was an actual party in the earlier litigation.\nThe  Attorney  General  opinion  which  gave  rise  to  this\nlitigation interpreted the exact statute in a contrary manner\nto an Attorney General opinion issued in 2001.  Both opinions\nconstrued Ala. Code § 15-12-21(d)(1975) and reached opposite\nconclusions concerning whether the phrase “expenses reasonably\nincurred” included approved office overhead expenses.  The\ncurrent  Attorney  General  is  disingenuous  in  relying  upon\nminor, technical differences in the statute which was amended\nin  2000.    There  have  been  judicial  interpretations  of  the\nstatute that are at odds with the current interpretation by\nthe Attorney General and the changed language upon which the\n7\n\nAttorney General relied did not address the core meaning of\nthe statute. \nAlthough  the  legislature  cannot  amend  the  statute  by\nresolution,  the  resolution  is  helpful,  particularly  where\nthere is not legislative history.  The resolution passed in\nAct 2002-129 provides a valuable perspective for the Court to\nconsider. \nConsistency  is  a  vital  underpinning  in  the  law.    If\nAttorney General’s opinions are subjected to the sifting sands\nof the moment, there can be no consistency.  In addition,\nstate  officials  who  rely  upon  the  Attorney  General  for\nguidance and the general public who rely upon state officials\nshould be able to rely upon an opinion of the Attorney General\nwithout fear that an identical statute will be interpreted\ndifferently.  \n8\n\nARGUMENT\nI. EITHER  JUDICIAL  ESTOPPEL  OR  COLLATERAL  ESTOPPEL  BARS\nALABAMA’S COMPTROLLER FROM FAILING TO PAY APPROVED OFFICE\nOVERHEAD  EXPENSES  TO  LAWYERS  APPOINTED  TO  REPRESENT\nINDIGENT CLIENTS.\nThe  legal  landscape  of  indigent  defense  substantially\nchanged in 1993 with the decision in May v. State, 672 So. 2d\n1307 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993).  The May court analyzed then-\nexisting Ala. Code § 15-12-21 (d)(1975), which, after setting\nhourly rates and maximum fees to be paid for indigent defense\nstated, “[C]ounsel shall also be entitled to be reimbursed for\nany  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  such  defense  to  be\napproved in advance by the trial court.”  May v. State, 672\nSo. 2d at 1308.  The Court of Criminal Appeals recognized the\nvalidity of overhead payments by holding “that office overhead\nexpenses  are  by  law  encompassed  in  the  term  ‘expenses\nreasonably incurred’ as that term is used in §15-12-21(d).”\nId.  The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals’  decision  in  May  was\nundisturbed when this Court quashed writs of certiorari in Ex\nparte State, 672 So. 2d 1310 (Ala. 1995) and Ex parte May, 672\nSo. 2d 1310 (Ala. 1995).\nThe Court explicitly approved of the Court of Criminal\nAppeals’ rationale in Ex parte Smith, 698 So. 2d 219 (Ala.\n1997).  In that case this Court unmistakably stated, “we agree\n9\n\nwith the Court of Criminal Appeals’ holding in May that §15-\n12-21 authorizes payments to a court-appointed attorney for\noverhead  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  defense  of  an\nindigent defendant.”  Ex parte Smith, 698 So. 2d at 224.  For\nyears, there was no change in the payment scheme for private\ncounsel  who  were  court-appointed  to  represent  indigent\nclients.  \nIn  1999,  Ala.  Code  §  15-12-21(d)  was  amended.    In\naddition to increasing hourly rates and maximum fee payments,\nthe  sentence  applicable  to  reimbursement  for  expenses  was\naltered  ever  so  slightly  to  read,  “counsel  shall  also  be\nentitled to be reimbursed for any expenses reasonably incurred\nin  the  defense  of  his  or  her  client,  to  be  approved  in\nadvanced  by  the  trial  court.”    The  Alabama  Comptroller\nrecognized that the payment of office overhead expenses was\nunaffected by the Legislature’s amendment of § 15-12-21(d) and\nissued a Memorandum to that effect on August 24, 1999, as well\nas a like Memorandum the following year.1  \nIn litigation spawned by an earlier, temporary cut-off in\nthe payment of office overhead expenses, the Circuit Court of\n1     These memoranda are attached respectively as Exhibits\nB and C to the brief of amicus curiae Covington County Bar\nAssociation in this proceeding and, for the convenience of\nthe Court, are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B.\n10\n\nCovington County entered summary judgment in an action for\ndeclaratory judgment in Christensen v. Childree, stating, “it\nis hereby ordered that partial summary judgment be entered for\nPlaintiff  on  his  request  for  a  declaratory  judgment,  said\njudgment being that the term ‘expenses reasonably incurred’\nfound  in  Code  of  Alabama,  §  15-12-21(d)  includes  office\noverhead expenses. . . .”2  The Comptroller did not seek to\nappeal the order of the Circuit Court of Covington County in\nChristensen. \n  On February 1, 2005, the Alabama Attorney General issued\nOpinion  2005-063.    That  opinion  radically  altered  the\nlandscape for the compensation of those defending indigent\ndefendants since this Attorney General’s opinion reached a\ncontrary conclusion to prior, related opinions of the Attorney\nGeneral, as well established judicial precedent, that approved\noffice  overhead  expenses  were  not  included  in  the  phrase\n“expenses reasonably incurred” in Ala. Code § 15-12-21(d).\nThe  Comptroller’s  reliance  on  this  contradictory\ninterpretation provoked new litigation in the Circuit Court of\nCovington County, a motion to hold the Comptroller in contempt\n2     Again, while the order in Christensen v. Childree\nwas attached to the brief of amicus curiae Covington County\nBar Association, it is attached hereto as Exhibit C for the\nCourt’s convenience.\n11\n\nfor his failure to abide by the final judgment issued by that\ncourt  concerning  the  payment  of  approved  office  overhead\nexpenses.\nFollowing  the  filing  of  the  motion  to  hold  the\nComptroller  in  contempt  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  Covington\nCounty, the Comptroller responded and conceded the issue by\nstating,  “[T]he  Comptroller  respectfully  agrees  that  this\nHonorable Court’s Order in this matter, dated May 30, 2002,\ndeclaring that ‘office overhead expenses’ are encompassed in\nthe term ‘expenses reasonably incurred’ in § 15-12-21(d), for\nindigent defense fee declarations submitted by the Plaintiff\nis  due  to  be  honored  by  the  Comptroller.”  Christensen  v.\nChildree, Circuit Court of Covington County, Case No. CV-2002-\n50, Defendant Robert L. Childree’s Supplemental Response to\nthe Plaintiff’s Motion to Hold Defendant in Contempt, at 1. \nIn addition, the Comptroller, conceding that, in light of the\n2002 judgment of the Circuit Court Of Covington County, the\nComptroller  agreed  to  “pay  any  pending  or  future  properly\ndocumented claims for ‘office overhead expenses’ in indigent\ncriminal matters arising in the 22nd Judicial Circuit.” Id. at\n12\n\n2.3 \nJudicial estoppel is an established doctrine recognized\nin Alabama, the contours of which were defined in Unum Life\nIns. Co. of America v. Wright, 897 So. 2d 1059 (Ala. 2004).\nIn that case, this Court relied upon New Hampshire v. Maine,\n532  U.S.  742  (2001),  for  its  holding  “that  for  judicial\nestoppel  to  apply  (1)  a  party’s  later  position  must  be\n‘clearly  inconsistent’  with  its  earlier  position;  (2)  the\nparty must have been successful in the prior proceeding so\nthat  judicial  acceptance  of  an  inconsistent  position  in  a\nlater proceeding would create ‘the perception that either the\nfirst or second court was misled.’” (quoting Edwards v. Aetna\nLife Ins., 690 F.2d 595, 599 (6th Cir. 1982); and (3) the party\nseeking to assert an inconsistent position must ‘derive an\nunfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing\nparty if not estopped.’ 532 U. S. at 750-51.  No requirement\nof a showing of privity or reliance appears in the foregoing\nstatement  of  factors  to  consider  in  determining  the\napplicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel.’” Id.,\n3     The Comptroller’s Supplemental Response to\nPlaintiff’s Motion to Hold Defendant in Contempt filed in\nthe Circuit Court of Covington County in Christensen v.\nChildree, Case No. CV-2002-50, is attached hereto as Exhibit\nD for the Court’s convenience.\n13\n\nquoting Ex parte First Alabama Bank, 883 So. 2d 1236, 1244-45\n(Ala. 2003).  Judicial estoppel applies in the present case\nto bar the Alabama Comptroller from taking the position that\nseeks to excuse his failure to pay judicially approved office\noverhead expenses.  \nWhile  the  Comptroller  has  pursued  a  position  in  this\nlitigation that is consistent with his position in the 2002\nCovington County litigation - - that office overhead expenses\nare not payable as “expenses reasonably incurred” within the\nmeaning of Ala. Code § 15-12-21(d), that position is “clearly\ninconsistent” with the Comptroller’s demonstrated position in\ndeclining  to  appeal  the  original  adverse  decision  of  the\nCircuit  Court  of  Covington  County.    The  Comptroller’s\ninconsistent  position  was  again  shown  when  he  agreed  to\ncompensate  Mr.  Christensen  and  all  other  attorneys  in\nCovington  County  for  approved  office  overhead  expenses,\ninstead of taking the risk of being found in contempt for\nfailure to abide by the prior judgment of that court.  In\naddition,  in  the  court  below  in  the  present  case,  “the\nComptroller  took  little  issue  with  plaintiff’s  view  and\nexpressed a simple desire for judicial guidance.”  Wright v.\nChildree, Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, Civil\n14\n\nAction No. 05-1544, September 28, 2005, at 3.  In addition,\nthe  trial  court  noted  the  clear  inconsistency  in  the\nComptroller’s position by observing that “most curiously, [the\nComptroller] continues to this day to reimburse attorneys for\noverhead expenses in the Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit even\nthough it stopped such reimbursements for all other Alabama\nattorneys  in  February  2005.”    Id.  at  2.    Clearly,  the\nComptroller  abandoned  his  position  that  approved  office\noverhead expenses were not payable under § 15-12-21(d) by not\nappealing  the  Covington  County  judgment  and  implicitly\nrecognized that when he “took little issue” with the position\nadvanced by Mr. Wright in the court below.\nBy  arguing  a  contrary  position  to  that  which  the\nComptroller  accepted  as  a  result  of  the  Covington  County\nlitigation, the Comptroller apparently attempted to create the\nperception that either the Circuit Court of Montgomery County\nwould be misled (if it adopted his current position on office\noverhead expenses) or the Circuit Court of Covington County\nwould be misled since the Comptroller declined to appeal that\njudgment and continues to reimburse Covington County lawyers\nfor approved overhead expenses.\nThe Comptroller seeks, by his inconsistent positions, to\n15\n\nimpose an unfair detriment on Mr. Wright (and by extension\nother attorneys in the state) since that position, if adopted,\nwould deny Mr. Wright reimbursement for approved and incurred\noffice overhead expenses, currently something only provided to\nattorneys practicing in Covington County.  The Comptroller’s\naction  clearly  meets  the  standard  for  the  application  of\njudicial estoppel as defined in Unum Life Ins. Co. of America\nand the judgment of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County\nshould be affirmed on that basis.  However, even if the Court\nfinds  that  judicial  estoppel  is  inapplicable,  collateral\nestoppel barred the Comptroller from taking a position in the\nCircuit Court of Montgomery County and advancing that position\nhere,  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  binding  effect  of  the\njudgment in the litigation in which he was a party the Circuit\nCourt of Covington.   In order “to interpose a valid defense\nof collateral estoppel . . . two elements are required: 1) The\nparty  claiming  the  benefit  of  the  prior  judgement  as  an\nestoppel against the adversarial party is one who one would\nhave been prejudiced by a contrary decision in the previous\ncase; 2) the party against whom the estoppel by judgment is\nsought either was an actual party in the previous case or was\nprivity with, or is a successor to the rights of, an actual\n16\n\nparty in the previous case.”  Constantine v. U. S. Fidelity &\nGuar. Co., 545 So. 2d 750, 755 - 56 (Ala. 1989).  \nThere is no doubt that Mr. Wright would have experienced\nprejudice if the Circuit Court of Covington County had ruled\nagainst Mr. Christensen because such an adverse ruling would\nserve as precedent in the present case.  In addition, the\nparty  against  whom  collateral  estoppel,  or  estoppel  by\njudgment, is sought to be applied here was the actual party in\nthe prior case that was litigated in the Circuit Court of\nCovington County.  Plainly, the Comptroller was a party in the\nCovington County litigation and is bound by that judgment.\nTherefore, both elements of collateral estoppel are present\nhere.  Accordingly, the Comptroller should be prohibited from\ntaking a position contrary to the position which he accepted,\nor in which he acquiesced, first by his decision not to appeal\nthe adverse ruling of the Circuit Court of Covington County\nand later by conceding the issue and seeking only “guidance”\nfrom the Circuit Court of Montgomery County.\nII. THE NEED FOR CERTAINTY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE LAW SHOULD\nPREVENT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM ISSUING CONTRADICTORY\nADVISORY OPINIONS THAT INTERPRET THE SAME STATUTE.\nIn the present case, the Comptroller posed the following\nquestion  to  be  answered  by  the  Attorney  General:  “May  an\n17\n\nattorney representing an indigent defendant claim both office\noverhead at a rate approved in advance by the trial court and\nexpenses  under  the  ‘Uniform  Guidelines  for  Attorney  Fee\nDeclarations?’” Op. Atty. Gen. No. 2005-063, 2005 WL 366930,\nat  *1  (February  1,  2005).    While  the  Comptroller  did  not\ndirectly  pose  the  question  about  whether  office  overhead\nexpenses are a component of “expenses reasonably incurred”, as\nthat phrase is used in § 15-12-21(d), the Attorney General\nnevertheless  took  the  opportunity  to  declare  that,  in  his\nview, office overhead expenses were no longer payable.  This\nopinion was not issued in a vacuum by Attorney General King.\nSeveral years before, then-Attorney General William H. Pryor\nconsidered the precise statutory scheme, as well as the same\nrelevant case law, and concluded that approved office overhead\nexpenses were a part of “expenses reasonably incurred” and\npayable under § 15-12-21(d).\nIn Op. Atty. Gen. No. 2002-022, 2001 WL 1421621 (October\n15, 2001), Attorney General Pryor affirmatively answered the\nfollowing question posed by a trial court: “Is an attorney\nappointed  to  represent  an  indigent  individual  eligible  to\nclaim office overhead expenses when he does not maintain an\noffice but practices out of his apartment?”  In conducting the\n18\n\nanalysis, the Attorney General construed Ala. Code § 15-12-\n21(d)(Supp. 2000), the statute amended by the Legislature in\n2002 and which was the subject of Attorney General King’s 2005\nopinion.  The language in the 2000 amendment substituted “in\ndefense  of  his  or  her  client”  for  the  previous  language\ncontained in § 15-12-21(d), which read “in such defense.”  The\nstatute upon which Attorney General Pryor’s opinion was based\nis the precise statute upon which Attorney General King based\nthe opinion which triggered the instant case.  Despite the\ninterpretation of the identical statute by the two Attorneys\nGeneral, Attorney General King reached the opposite conclusion\nfrom that reached by Attorney General Pryor less than four\nyears earlier.  \nIn  the  2005  opinion,  Attorney  General  King  placed\nsubstantial reliance for his conclusion that approved office\noverhead  expenses  were  no  longer  payable  as  “expenses\nreasonably incurred” for indigent defense based on the change\nfrom “in such defense” to “in defense of his or her client” in\nthe amended statute.  In doing so, the Attorney General was\nplainly  disingenuous  since  the  relied-upon  language  did\nnothing to modify the substance of the statute which had been\ninterpreted by the Court of Criminal Appeals in May v. State,\n19\n\n672 So. 2d 1307 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993) and approved by this\ncourt in Ex parte Smith, 698 So. 2d 219, 224 (Ala. 1997),\nwhere the court stated, “[W]e agree with the Court of Criminal\nAppeals’ holding in May that § 15-12-21 authorizes payment to\na court-appointed attorney for overhead expenses reasonably\nincurred in defense of an indigent defendant.”  Whether the\noverhead  expenses  are  incurred  “in  such  defense”,  or  “in\ndefense of his or her client”, or “in defense of an indigent\ndefendant”, the impact is no different.  Approved overhead\nexpenses are a part of a lawyer’s expenses when defending an\nindividual who is indigent and unable to afford counsel of his\nor her choosing.  \nIn  2002  Alabama’s  Legislature  passed  a  resolution,\ncontained  in  Act  2002-129,  declaring  that  its  intent  in\nenacting Act 99-427 (the legislation amending § 15-12-21(d))\nwas not to eliminate approved office overhead expenses as a\npart of reimbursable expenses in indigent defense.  While it\nis true that “a joint resolution cannot be used to amend an\nexisting statute []”, Opinion of the Justices No. 265, 381 So.\n2d 183, 185 (Ala. 1980), the Legislature’s action in passing\nAct 2002-129 was not to amend § 15-12-21(d).  In a state where\nthere  is  a  dearth  of  legislative  history  accompanying\n20\n\nstatutory enactments, a resolution such as Act 2002-129 serves\nthe  valuable  purpose  of  providing  the  Legislature’s\nperspective  in  the  event  that  statutory  construction  is\nnecessary in order to interpret a statute.4\nThere are sound policy reasons why the Attorney General\nshould be prevented from issuing contradictory interpretations\nof the same statute.  Consistency is an important function in\nlaw.    If  Attorney  General’s  opinions  are  subject  to  the\nvagaries or political considerations of the moment, then there\nwill be little that can be said for consistency.  In addition,\nthere needs to be predictability so that all who are subject\nto  the  effect  of  laws  interpreted  by  the  Attorney  General\nunderstand their duties and responsibilities under it.  This\nis particularly true when it comes to those persons occupying\nthe positions capable of requesting opinions of the Attorney\nGeneral.    See  Ala.  Code  36-15-1(1975).    In  conducting  the\nbusiness  of  state  government,  state  officials  must  not  be\nplaced  on  a  teeter-totter  that  will  ascend  or  descend\n4     Amici do not concede that statutory construction\nis necessary to determine that approved office overhead\nexpenses are included in “expenses reasonably incurred in §\n15-12-21(d).  The statute is plain on its face and several\njudicial decisions have construed it in such manner. \nHowever, the Legislative’s resolution is a valuable tool for\nthe Court to consider. \n21\n\ndepending  upon  the  attitude,  outlook,  or  political\nproclivities of a particular Attorney General, particularly\nwhen the public relies upon those officials for the effective\nconduct of state business.\nSince Attorney General Pryor delivered an opinion which\nconstrued the identical statute which Attorney General King\nconstrued, the contradictory opinion of Attorney General King\nshould be given no weight.  The Court should rule in a manner\nconsistent with established law that approved office overhead\nexpenses  are  included  in  the  phrase  “expenses  reasonably\nincurred”, as it is used in Ala. Code § 15-12-21(d).\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae the NACDL\nand the ACDLA urge the Court to affirm the judgment of the\ncourt below. \nRespectfully submitted, this the 1st day of March, 2006.\n_____________________________________\nStephen R.

Childree \nState Comptroller \nI 00 North Union Street, Suite 220 \nMontgomery, Alabama  36130-2602 \nIndigent  Defense  Fund  Indigents \nOverhead  Expenses  - State  Comptroller \nAttorney Fees \nAct  99-427  amended  section  15-12-21(d) \nof  the  Code  of  Alabama  to  eliminate \noverhead  as  an  expense  for  which  an \nappointed attorney can be reimbursed.  An \nattorney can only be reimbursed for out-of \npocket  expenses  that  are  approved  by  the \ntrial court in advance of being incurred. \nDear Mr. Childree: \nThis  opinion  of  the  Attorney  General  is  issued  m  response  to  your \nrequest. \nQUESTION \nMay  an  attorney representing  an  indigent defen \ndant  claim  both office  overhead  at  a  rate  approved  in \nadvance by the trial court and expenses under the \"Uni \nform Guidelines for Attorney Fee Declarations?\" \nFACTS AND ANALYSIS \nYour request includes the following facts: \nPrior to  the  advent  of May  v.  State,  672  So.  2d \n1307  (Ala.  Crim.  App.  1993),  which,  by  order  of the \nAlabama  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals,  instituted  the \npayment  of office  overhead  to  attorneys  representing \n\nHonorable Robert L. Childree \nPage 2 \nindigent  defendants  in  criminal  proceedings,  the  Indi \ngent Defense Commission of the  Alabama Bar in con \njunction with  the  Administrative Office  of Courts  and \nthe Office of the Comptroller issued a set of \"Uniform \nGuidelines for Attorney Fee Declarations.\"  The guide \nlines outlined administrative processes for attorneys to \nuse  in  filing  fee  declarations  for  services  they  per \nformed in representing indigent defendants and specifi \ncally  provided  for  certain  expenses  incurred  by  the \nattorney,  including  things  such  as  travel,  office \nexpenses (copies, postage),  etc.  From the  adoption of \nthe  guidelines  until  May,  which  provides  for  office \noverhead, the Comptroller honored the specifics of the \nguidelines  and  reimbursed  attorneys  based on the  spe \ncifics  contained  therein.  After May,  the  amount  paid \nfor office overhead has been deemed to cover all office \nexpenses due to the attorney.  However, some attorneys \nhave contended that they should be entitled to both May \noverhead  and  office  expenses  in  accordance  with  the \nguidelines. \nSection  15-12-21  of the Code of Alabama provides for the compensation \nof attorneys  and  the  payment  of expenses  incurred  in  the  defense  of indigent \ndefendants.  ALA.  CODE§ 15-12-21  (Supp. 2003).  The first part of section 15-\n12-21(d)  sets  the hourly rate  for  in-court and out-of-court  time  and  the  maxi \nmum fee depending on the severity of the crime or type of case.  !d.  The latter \npart of that section states, in pertinent part, as follows: \nCounsel shall also be entitled to be reimbursed for any \nexpenses reasonably incurred in the defense of his or \nher client, to be approved in advance by the trial court. \nPreapproved expert fees  shall be billed at the time the \ncourt  is  notified  that  all  work  by the  expert  has  been \ncompleted, and shall be paid forthwith. \nALA. CODE § 15-12-21 (d) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added). \nAs indicated in your request, overhead reimbursement by appointed attor \nneys is governed by May and its progeny.  The decision of the Alabama Court of \nCriminal Appeals that office overhead expenses were reimbursable was based on \nthe predecessor language to the language emphasized above:  \"any expenses rea \nsonably incurred in such defense.\"  672 So. 2d at  1308 (emphasis added), cert. \ndenied as improvidently granted, 672 So. 2d 1310 (Ala.  1995).  It is notable that \n\nHonorable Robert L. Childree \nPage 3 \nJudge Montiel dissented in May, writing:  \"While I am sympathetic to the plight \nof attorneys  who  routinely  represent  indigent  defendants  for  what  amounts  to \ninadequate compensation, I believe the majority improperly attempts to correct a \nreal problem with indigent representation.\"  672 So. 2d at 1309. \nIn Ex Parte Barksdale, 680 So. 2d 1029 (Ala. Crim. App.  1996), the Ala \nbama  Court  of Criminal  Appeals  held,  relying  in  part  on  the  opinion  of the \nAttorney General to the Honorable Robert L.  Childree, State Comptroller, dated \nApril  19,  1996,  A.G.  No.  96-00192, that,  as  with all  other expenses,  overhead \nmust be approved by the trial court in advance of being incurred.  680 So. 2d at \nI 030.  Act 99-427 amended the statute to provide, among other changes, for the \nchange  in  the  expense  language.  The  Supreme  Court  of Alabama  approved \nBarksdale  in Lyons  v.  Norris,  829  So.  2d  748  (Ala.  2002)  (on  application  for \nrehearing).  In  doing  so,  however,  the  Court  discussed whether  overhead  was \nstill authorized at all in light of the act, focusing primarily on the change in the \nexpense language, stating as follows: \nIn  June  1999,  the  Alabama  Legislature  passed  the \n\"Investment in Justice Act of 1999.\"  Act No.  99-427, \n1999 Ala.  Acts.  In pertinent part, Act No.  99-427 sub \nstantively amended § 15-12-21 to increase attorney fees \nfor  appointed  work  at  the  trial  level.  Under the  Act, \nthe  rate  of  compensation  for  attorneys  representing \nindigent criminal defendants  was  increased to  $40  per \nhour for out-of-court time and $60 per hour for in-court \ntime.  The  fee  limits,  which  have  been  increased sub \nstantially,  are now based on the  severity of the  crime, \nand there is no limit on the total fee that can be paid to \nan  attorney  representing  a  defendant  charged  with  a \ncapital offense or with an offense that carries  a  possi \nble  sentence of life imprisonment without parole.  Sec \ntion  15-12-21,  as  amended,  also  specifies  that  \"the \ncourt for good cause shown may approve an attorney's \nfee  in  excess of the  maximum  amount allowed.\"  Sec \ntion  15-12-21  now  provides  that  to  be  reimbursable, \nany  expenses  incurred  must  be  incurred,  specifically, \n\"in the  defense of his  or her client.\"  Here,  the  attor \nneys seek reimbursement for office-overhead expenses, \nincluding but not limited to:  professional license fees; \nmalpractice,  casualty,  health,  general-liability,  and \nworkers'  compensation  insurance;  office  salaries;  ad \nvalorem  taxes;  office  supplies;  postage  and  express \ndelivery charges; depreciation for office equipment and \n\nHonorable Robert L. Childree \nPage 4 \nfurniture;  local  and  long-distance  telephone  charges; \n\"CLE  expenses,  including  travel  and  lodging  for  out \nof-town  seminars  (incurred  one  or  more  times  per \nyear)\"; utilities; various bank fees and interest on busi \nness  loans;  and  other  professional  fees.  Although \nwhether these fees are actually incurred \"in the defense \nof [an  attorney's]  client\"  is  highly  questionable,  that \nissue  is  not presently before this  Court.  Neither does \nthis Court have before it the question of the applicabil \nity  of  Act  No.  99-427  to  office-overhead  expenses. \nHowever,  the  change  in  language  in  Act No.  99-42 7 \nfrom  \"any  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  such \ndefense\" to  \"any expenses reasonably incurred in the \ndefense of his or her client,\" prohibits reimbursement \nof office-overhead expenses  based on  calculations  of \nthe  pro  rata  cost  of an  attorney's  criminal practice \ncompared to his overall practice.  At the same time, it \nprecludes  advance  calculations  of  office-overhead \nexpenses  for  a  specific  criminal  defendant.  The \nincrease in fees,  together with the ability of the courts \nto  approve fees  in  excess  of the  mandated maximum \n''for good cause shown,\" further  indicates the Legis \nlature's intent to eliminate reimbursement for \"office \noverhead expenses\" under Act No.  99-42 7. \nLyons, 829 So. 2d at 751  n.  1 (emphasis added). \nThe Alabama Court of Civil Appeals has characterized Lyons as  a plural \nity  opm1on.  State  Dep 't  of Human  Resources  v.  Estate  of Harris,  857  So.  2d \n818, 822 (Ala. Civ. App. 2002).  Three justices agreed with the above language. \nJustices  Brown  and  Stuart  concurred  in  the  opinion,  which  was  authored  by \nChief  Justice  Moore.  Four  justices  disagreed  with  the  language.  Justice \nHarwood concurred specially, writing that the overhead discussion was not nec \nessary and not properly before the Court.  He was joined by Justices Houston, \nLyons,  and  Woodall.  Although  Justice  Johnstone  concurred  in  part  and  dis \nsented  in  part,  and  Justice  See  joined  in  his  concurrence,  because  Justice \nJohnstone dissented that expenses do not have to be approved in advance, and he \nconcurred in overruling the application for rehearing because the applicant was \nnot properly before the Court, both justices indicated that they otherwise agreed \nwith the main opinion.  Lyons, 829 So. 2d at 755-756. \nEven though Lyons  appears to  be binding, the language at  issue  is  dicta. \nIt is,  nevertheless,  instructional.  The Supreme Court repeatedly emphasized in \n\nHonorable Robert L. Childree \nPage 5 \nthe  opinion  that,  \"[a]lthough  whether  these  fees  are  actually  incurred  'in the \ndefense of [an attorney's] client'  is highly questionable, that issue is not pres \nently before this Court.  Neither does this Court have before it the question of \nthe  applicability of Act  No.  99- 427  to  office-overhead  expenses\"  [id.  at  751 \nn.  1],  and  \"[t]he current dispute turns  on the  meaning attributed to  the  phrase \n'approved in advance by the trial court.\"'  !d.  at 752.  Nonetheless, this Office \nfinds  the reasoning  in Lyons highly persuasive.  Moving from  the general, \"in \nsuch defense,\" to the more specific, \"in the defense of his or her client,\" cou \npled with the history of the statute and the increase in fees, indicates the Legis \nlature's  intent  to  restrict  section  15-12-21(d)  expenses  to  out-of-pocket \nexpenses. \nThis Office acknowledges the Legislature's \"resolution\" in Act 2002-129 \nthat the intent of Act 99-42 7 was \"that overhead expenses shall be paid in addi \ntion to in-court and out-of-court fees ....\"   2002 Ala. Acts No. 2002-129, 347. \nThis resolution, however, is not controlling.  As the Supreme Court of Alabama \nhas explained: \n\"A resolution such as this one is not a  law;  it  is \nmerely the form  in which the Legislature expresses an \nopmwn.  The  Legislature  has  no  power  to  make  or \nchange law by resolution.  Art. IV § 61, Ala. Constitu \ntion  ('No  law  shall  be  passed  except  by  bill. ... '); \nGunter v.  Beasley, 414 So.2d 41  (Ala.1982).  Whatever \nthe Legislature may have intended by [the joint resolu \ntion]  is  irrelevant  to  our resolution  of the  issues  pre \nsented on this appeal.  The controlling law here is that \nexpressed in the applicable ... acts. See Opinion of the \nJustices No.  2 7 5, 396 So.2d 81  (Ala.  1981 );  Opinion of \nthe Justices No.  265, 381  So.2d 183 (Ala.1980) (a stat \nute  cannot  be  amended  by  a  joint  resolution  of the \nLegislature).\" \nBarna  Budweiser of Montgomery v.  Anheuser-Busch,  Inc.,  783  So.  2d 792,  798 \n(Ala. 2000), quoting Laidlaw Transit,  Inc.  v.  Ala. Educ. Ass 'n,  769 So. 2d 872, \n883 (Ala. 2000). \nSection V of the \"Uniform Guidelines for Attorney Fee Declarations\" lists \nthe  following  as  expenses  not  requiring  preapproval:  Private  investigators, \nexpert witnesses, transcripts of trials or hearings not otherwise available, inter \npreters,  and  scientific  tests.  The  section  then  lists  the  following  as  expenses \nrequiring  preapproval:  Copying,  long  distance  telephone  calls,  and  travel. \nContrary  to  this  categorization,  the  Supreme  Court  made  clear  in  Lyons  that \n\nHonorable Robert L. Childree \nPage 6 \n\"expenses ... are specifically addressed by§ 15-12-21(d).  The plain language \nof §  15-12-21 (d) indicates that an order approving an  expense must be entered \nbefore counsel incurs the expense.\"  829 So. 2d at 753. \nCONCLUSION \nAct 99-427 amended section 15-12-21 (d) of the Code of Alabama to elimi \nnate overhead as an expense for which an appointed attorney can be reimbursed. \nAn  attorney  can  only  be  reimbursed  for  out-of-pocket  expenses  that  are \napproved by the trial court in advance of being incurred. \nI hope this opinion answers your question.
