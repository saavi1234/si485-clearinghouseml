We  are  asked  in  this  case  to \ndetermine  whether  the  assigned  counsel  compensa- \ntion  system  currently  utilized  in  the  Wayne  Cir- \ncuit  Court!  and  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  pro- \nvides  counsel  assigned  to  represent  indigent  defen- \ndants  “reasonable  compensation”  within  the  mean- \ning  of  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253.  We  hold  that  it \ndoes  not.  Because  we  decide  this  issue  in  favor  of \nthe  petitioners,  we  need  not  reach  the  remaining \nissues  raised  in  this  complaint  for  superintending \ncontrol.” \nI \nIn  June  1988,  Chief  Judges  Dalton  A.  Roberson \nof  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  and  Richard  C. \n    \nKaufman  of  the  Third  Circuit  Court  promulgated \nthe  fee  schedule  currently  in  dispute.  Unlike  previ- \nous  fee  schedules  which  compensated  counsel  on \nthe  basis  of  representational  “events”  performed \nby  assigned  counsel,  the  new  fee  schedule  operates \nto  pay  a  “fixed-fee”  for  the  entire  representation \nthrough  sentencing,  regardless  of  events,  on  the \n  \n1 Hereafter  Third  Circuit  Court. \n2 The  other  issues  raised  by  the  petitioners  include:  (1)  whether  the \nfixed-fee  system  results  in  lowering  the  quality  of  indigent  representa- \ntion  to  a  level  that  is  inadequate  under  the  Sixth  Amendment  of  the \nUnited  States  Constitution;  (2)  whether  the  fixed-fee  system  operates \nto  deprive  indigent  defense  counsel  of  equal  protection  and  due \nprocess  of  law,  contrary  to  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United \nstates  Constitution  and  Const  1968,  art  1,  §  2;  and  (3)  whether  the \nfixed-fee  system  operates  to  “take”  the  property  of  assigned  counsel \nwithout  just  compensation  and  due  process  of  law,  contrary  to  the \nFifth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States  Constitution  - \nand  Const  1963,  art  10,  §2.  See  Taylor  v  Auditor  General,  360  Mich \n146,  154;  103  NW2d  769  (1960)  (stating  that  “few  principles  of judicial \ninterpretation  are  more  firmly  grounded  than  this:  a  court  does  not \ngrapple  with  a  constitutional  issue  except  as  a  last  resort”). \n  \nbasis  of  the  maximum  penalty  imposable  for  the \ncrime  charged.  This  fee  schedule  became  effective \nJuly  1,  1988,  and  remains  in  effect  as  of  the  date \nof  this  opinion.  The  petitioners  filed  a  complaint \nfor  superintending  control  in  this  Court  on  May  5, \n1989,  challenging  the  reasonableness  and  constitu- \ntionality  of  the  fixed-fee  schedule.  Specifically,  the \npetitioners  asked  this  Court  to  invalidate  the  fixed- \nfee  schedule  and  to  order  the  Third  Circuit  Court \nand  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  to  adopt  and \nimplement  an  “event-based”  fee  schedule  devel- \noped  in  1981  by  a  committee  headed  by  Recorder’s \nCourt  Judge  Clarice  Jobes*  adjusted  for  inflation. \nUnable  to  resolve  this  case  without  the  aid  of  a \nfactual  record,  we  appointed  the  Honorable  Tyrone \nGillespie  as  special  master  and  directed  him  to \nconduct  an  evidentiary  hearing  and  to  propose \nfindings  of  fact  to  this  Court  on  the  following \ntopics: \n    \n(1)  the  various  rates  of  reimbursement  for  ap- \npointed  counsel  in  Michigan;  (2)  the  amount  of \noverhead  and  expenses  typically  incurred  by  attor- \nneys  who  accept  appointments  to  represent  indi- \ngent  criminal  defendants;  (3)  the  amount  of  in- \n  \n3Jn  1981,  a  complaint  for  superintending  control  was  filed  in  this \nCourt  seeking  an  increase  in  fees  paid  under  the  fee  schedule  then \nexisting  in  the  Third  Circuit  Court  and  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court. \nIn  response  to  this  complaint,  the  chief  judges  formed  a  committee, \nheaded  by  Recorder’s  Court  Judge  Clarice  Jobes,  to  study  the  fee \nsystem.  After  completing  the  study,  Judge  Jobes  issued  a  report, \nrecommending  fee  increases  that  roughly  tripled  the  fees  that  were \n.being  paid  for  certain  key  items,  particularly  trial  per  diem.  The \nrecommended  fee  schedule,  which  became  known  as  the  “Jobes  Plan,” \nwas  to  remain  event-based. \nAfter  acknowledging  the  reasonableness  of  the  compensation  rates \nproposed  by  the  Jobes’  committee,  the  chief judges  voted  to  adopt  the \nJobes  Plan  without  revision  and  scheduled  it  to  become  effective \nDecember  1,  1982.  The  plan  was  never  instituted,  however,  because \nthe  chief judges  succumbed  to  county  budgetary  concerns  and  refused \nto  implement  the  plan.  Instead,  the  chief  judges  formulated  yet \nanother  fee  schedule  that  operated  to  compensate  assigned  counsel  at \nsignificantly  lower  rates. \n  \n”  ¢ c  on oe aera.

Judge  Gillespie  issued \nproposed  findings  of  fact  in  a  226-page  report  on \nApril  3,  1991.  In  his  report,  Judge  Gillespie  noted \nthat  the  assigned  counsel  compensation  systems \nutilized  in  this  state  vary  to  some  degree  from \n  \ncircuit  to  circuit.  The  Third  Circuit  Court  and \nDetroit  Recorder’s  Court  were,  however,  the  only \ncourts  to  use  a  fixed-fee  schedule  that  pays  a  flat \nfee  to  assigned  counsel  on  the  basis  of  the  poten- \n \ntial  maximum  sentence  that  a  defendant  may  face, \nif  convicted. \nJudge  Gillespie  also  noted  a  wide  variation  in \nthe  profitability  of  accepting  indigent  defense  cases \nunder  the  fixed-fee  system.  He  cites  two  primary \nreasons  for  this  variation:  (1)  the  disparity  in \nattorney  overhead‘  and  expenses,’  and  (2)  case \n  \n4 Although  Judge  Gillespie  found  that  “the  average  overhead  rate \n[for  attorneys]  in  the  Detroit  area  varies  from  $35  to  $45  an  hour,”  he \nalso  noted  that  there  are  a  number  of  attorneys  who  are  assigned \ncriminal  cases  that  have  httle,  if  any,  overhead.  Estimated  to  consti- \ntute  approximately  ten  to  fifteen  percent  of  the  criminal  bar  in \nWayne  County,  these  attorneys  are  referred  to  as  “waivers  and \npleaders”  who  operate  from  pocket  notes  without  secretaries  or  offices \nwho  live  on  guilty  pleas. \n5  The  fees  paid  for  expert  witnesses  such  as  psychologists, \npsychiatrists,  medical  experts,  interpreters,  investigators  and \nother  supplemental  requirements  are  so  low  as  to  make  their \nservices  unavailable  without  supplementation  of  funds  by  the \nattorney.  Some  costs,  such  as  postage,  copy  and  local  travel,  are \nnever  reimbursed. \n  \n”  ¢ g  on oe  i  ot Ly fo  :  vel\"  wh “ nates ony a ret \ncomplexity.  Of  the  two,  Judge  Gillespie  found  that \nperhaps  the  most  determinative  factor  in  the  reali- \nzation  of  income  under  the  fixed-fee  system  is  the \ncomplexity  of  the  assigned  case.  In  this  regard, \nJudge  Gillespie  observed  an  “inverse  relationship” \nbetween  effort  expended  and  fees  paid  under  the \nfixed-fee  system.  Although  noting  that  the  system \nhad  the  meritorious  effect  of  speeding  up  the \ndocket,’  Judge  Gillespie  found  that  the  system \ntends  to  encourage  assigned  counsel  to  persuade \ntheir  clients  to  plead  guilty,  stating: \nThe  incentive,  if  a  lawyer  is  not  paid  to  spend \nmore  time  with  and  for  the  client,  is  to  put  in  as \nlittle  time  as  possible  for  the  pay  allowed.  Under \nthe  current  system,  a  lawyer  can  earn  $100  an \nhour  for  a  guilty  plea,  whereas  if  he  or  she  goes  to \ntrial  the  earnings  may  be  $15  an  hour  or  less. \nEssential  motions  are  neglected. \nIn  short,  the  system  of  reimbursement  of  as- \n  \nsigned  counsel  as  it  now  exists  creates  a  conflict \nbetween  the  attorney’s  need  to  be  paid  fully  for  his   \nservices  and  obtaining  the  full  panoply  of  rights \nfor  the  client.  Only  the  very  conscientious  will  do \nthe  latter  against  his  or  her  own  interests.” \n  \n€  In  addition  to  the  beneficial  effect  that  the  fixed-fee  system  has  on \nthe  docket,  Judge  Gillespie  also  found  that  the  fixed-fee  compensation \nsystem  had  merit  because:  (1)  it  “shortens  the  time  between  arrest \nand  disposition,  thus  alleviating  some  of  the  pressure  for  more  jail \nspace”;  (2)  “[iJf  a  client  is  pled  guilty  quickly,  the  compensation  is \nvery  adequate  as  it  represents  payment  for  only  three  or  four  hours \nof  attorney  time”;  (3)  “[flrivolous  motions  are  reduced  as  there  is  no \nfinancial  incentive  to  do  work  which  merely  takes  time”;  (4)  “[al]lter- \nnative  resolutions,  such  as  work  release  and  probation,  are  encour- \naged”;  (5)  “[d]ismissals  of  weak  cases  occur  at  an  early  stage”;  (6) \n“[pladding  of  hourly  accounts  is  eliminated”;  and  (7)  “(t]he  system \n[itself]  is  administratively  easier  to  operate.” \n7In  addition  to  encouraging  counsel  to  pressure  clients  to  plead \nguilty  and  discouraging  the  filing  of  even  serious  motions,  Judge \nGillespie  found  that  the  fixed-fee  system:  (1)  “discourages  plea  bar- \ngaining  in  that  the  prosecutor  is  aware  that  the  defense  attorney  has \nno  financial  incentive  to  go  to  trial  and  will  assent  to  a  guilty  plea  to \na  higher  charge”;  (2)  encourages  appointing  judges  to  assign  cases  on \nthe  basis  of  favoritism;  and  (3)  “supports  a  group  of  substandard \n  \n”  ¢ c  oo on = aera.  Fa.  co Ly to  c*  :  vel\"  wh “ nates oy a ret \nJudge  Gillespie  ultimately  concluded  that  any  ben- \nefits  derived  from  the  system  did  not  outweigh  the \nnegative  aspects  of  paying  assigned  counsel  in \nsuch  a  manner.  Accordingly,  Judge  Gillespie  rec- \nommended  that  this  Court  find  the  fixed-fee \nmethod  of  compensating  assigned  counsel  based  on \nthe  seriousness  of  the  crime  to  be  unreasonable, \nunjust,  and  a  disincentive  to  due  process.* \nHaving  considered  the  record  developed  at  the \nspecial  hearing,  along  with  the  briefs  and  oral \narguments  of  the  parties,  we  now  hold  that  the \nfixed-fee  system  currently  utilized  in  the  Third \nCircuit  Court  and  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court \nsystematically  fails  to  provide  “reasonable  compen- \nsation”  within  the  meaning  of  MCL  775.16;  MSA \n28.1253.  We  decline,  however,  the  invitation  to \ndirect  the  implementation  of  any  specific  system  or \nmethod  of  compensating  assigned  counsel,  electing \n \ninstead  to  leave  that  determination  to  the  sound \ndiscretion  of  the  chief  judges  of  the  respective \ncourts. \n  \nattorneys,  estimated  to  be  10  to  15%  of  the  criminal  bar,  to  [sic] \noperate  without  offices,  secretaries,  files,  from  pocket  notes  and  to \nmake  a  living  on  guilty  pleas.” \n8 Judge  Gillespie  proposed  three  alternative  remedies: \nA.  That  a  study  be  made  of  reasonable  time  involved  to \ndefend  each  of  the  crimes  in  the  present  schedule,  thus  estab- \nlishing  a  norm  similar  to  those  used  by  garages  in  estimating \nrepair  work.  If  the  fee  request  submitted  falls  within  the  norm, \nit  would  be  automatically  approved  for  the  time  expended  at  a \nreasonable  rate  of  $60  to  $70  per  hour.  Excesses  would  have  to \nbe  justified. \nB.  Do  as  the  plaintiff  asks  and  install  the  Jobes  Committee \nreport  with  a  reasonable  escalator  based  on  inflation  since \n1982. \nC.  Direct  the  court  to  devise  an  alternative  plan  within  a \nreasonable  time  which  would:  (1)  compensate  attorneys  fairly \nfor  time  spent,  and  (2)  put  no  pressure  on  defendants  to  plead \nguilty. \n  \n”  ¢ c  on oe aera.  Fa.  ot Ly fo  c*  :  vel\"  wh “ nates ony a ret \ni \nFrom  1967  to  1988,  the  Third  Circuit  Court  and \nthe  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  utilized  an  “event- \nbased”  fee  system  to  compensate  counsel  assigned \nto  represent  indigent  criminal  defendants.  Under \nthis  system,  assigned  counsel  was  compensated  on \nthe  basis  of  the  type  and  number  of  representa- \ntional  tasks  performed  in  providing  ordinary  legal \nservices  to  indigent  criminal  defendants.® \nIn  an  effort  to  reduce  jail  overcrowding,  a  “jail \noversight  committee,”  comprised  of  various  county \nofficials,  was  formed  to  examine  the  Wayne  County \ncriminal  justice  system  and  to  make  recommenda- \ntions,  concerning  how  to  reduce  demand  for  jail \nbeds.  The  committee  found  a  direct  correlation \nbetween  jail  bed  demand  and  the  length  of  the \ncriminal  docket.  Given  the  volume  of  criminal \ncases  in  Wayne  County,  the  committee  concluded \nthat  a  substantial  savings  in  jail  bed  demand  could \n    \nbe  recognized  by  reducing  the  time  between  a \ndefendant’s  arrest  and  the  ultimate  disposition  of \nthe  case.  Believing  that  a  large  percentage  of  cases \nwere  being  pleaded  “unnecessarily”  late  in  the \ncriminal  judicial  process,  often  on  the  day  of  trial, \nand  concerned  that  the  event-based  system  pro- \nvided  an  incentive  for  assigned  counsel  to  prolong \nfinal  disposition  of  cases  to  earn  an  enhanced  fee, \nthe  chief  judges  sought  to  develop  a  fee  system \nthat  would  operate  to  provide  a  disincentive  to \n“unnecessarily”  delay  guilty  pleas. \n  \n9A  separate  fee  was  paid  for  pre-preliminary  examination  jail \nvisits,  preliminary  examinations,  at  least  two  post-preliminary  exami- \nnation  jail  visits  (three,  if  the  defendant  was  charged  with  a  “capital” \noffense),  investigation  and  trial  preparation,  written  motions  filed  and \nheard,  calendar  conferences,  arraignments  on  the  information,  final \nconferences,  Walker  hearings,  evidentiary  hearings,  pleas,  and  foren- \nsic  hearings.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  the  former  event-based  fee \nsystem  provided  compensation  for  each  day  of  trial  necessary  to \ndispose  of  any  particular  case.  A  separate  fee  was  also  paid  for \ncounsel  appearances  in  court  for  defendant  sentencings. \n  \nGeorge  Gish,  Court  Administrator  and  Clerk  of \nthe  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court,  was  assigned  the \ntask  of  devising  a  compensation  system  that  would \neliminate  “unnecessary  delay”  and  promote  docket \nefficiency  without  reducing  the  overall  level  of \ncompensation  paid  to  assigned  counsel.  A  statisti- \ncal  analysis  revealed  a  direct  correlation  between \nthe  fees  paid  under  the  event-based  fee  system  and \nthe  maximum  sentence  imposable  for  a  particular \ncrime  under  our  recommended  sentencing  guide- \nlines.  In  other  words,  the  number  of  “events” \nperformed  in  representing  indigent  defendants  was \nfound  to  be  directly  related  to  the  maximum  sen- \ntence  that  a  defendant  faced.  Given  this  informa-  — \ntion,  Mr.  Gish  grouped  all  assigned  cases  for  the \nprevious  two  years  by  potential  maximum  sen- \ntence  and  averaged  the  fees  paid  in  each  group  of \ncases.  The  fixed-fee  schedule  therefore  represents \nan  average  of  actual  fees  paid  under  the  event- \nbased  system,  broken  down  by  the  maximum  sen-   \ntence  imposable  for  any  given  crime.  The  fixed \nrates  are: \nOffense  Category  Fixed  Fee \n  \n24  month  maximum  6  475 \n36  month  maximum  500 \n48  month  maximum  525 \n60  month  maximum  550 \n84  month  maximum  575 \n120  month  maximum  600 \n168  month  maximum  625 \n180  month  maximum  650 \n240  month  maximum  675 \nLife  750 \nsecond-degree  Murder  1,000 \nFirst-degree  Murder  1,400 \nBecause  the  scheduled  fees  represent  an  average  of \nthe  actual  fees  paid  over  a  two-year  period  under \nthe  event-based  fee  system,  compensation  for  indi- \n  \nvidual  representational  tasks  such  as  Jail  visits, \nmotions,  and  trial  per  diem  are  incorporated  into \nthe  fixed  fees.  Assigned  counsel  is  entitled  to  the \nfull  fee,  regardless  whether  the  case  is  dismissed \nat  the  preliminary  examination,\"  the  defendant \npleads  guilty  at  the  arraignment  on  the  informa- \ntion,  or  the  case  is  ultimately  disposed  of  after  a \nthree-day  jury  trial.” \nThe  fixed-fee  system  was  designed  to  promote \ndocket  efficiency,  yet  allow  overall  assigned  coun- \nsel  compensation  to  remain  exactly  the  same  as \nthat  paid  under  the  event-based  fee  system  that  it \nreplaced.  The  scheduled  fees  are  regarded  as  best \n  \n10 An  attorney  who  is  assigned  a  case  in  which  the  defendant  is \ncharged  with  multiple  crimes  is  entitled  only  to  the  fee  corresponding \nto  the  maximum  sentence  imposable  for  the  most  severe  crime \ncharged.  Further,  if  a  defendant  is  already  assigned  to  an  attorney \nand  an  additional  charge  is  filed  against  that  defendant,  assigned \ncounsel  is  entitled  only  to  a  fifty  percent  fee  for  the  second  crime  even \nif the  first  crime  is  pleaded  and  the  second  crime  requires  a  three-day \n     \ntrial.  Reduced  rates  are  also  paid  where  a  capias  is  issued  because  of \na  defendant's  failure  to  appear,  and  in  cases  in  which  retained \ncounsel  replaces  assigned  counsel  before  final  disposition  of the  case. \n11  Reduced  rates  are,  however,  paid  for  dismissals  caused  by  com- \nplainants’  failures  to  appear  at  preliminary  examinations. \n12 As  mentioned  above,  the  fixed  fees  are  based  on  the  average  total \nvouchers  submitted  under  the  event-based  system  over  the  two  years \nimmediately  preceding  the  implementation  of  the  extant  fee  system. \nThus,  the  fixed  fees  necessarily  incorporate  all  trial  per  diem  paid \nunder  the  event-based  system.  A  study  revealed  that  the  average \ncriminal  jury  trial  m  Wayne  County  took  3.1  days.  Despite  the  fact \nthat  the  odds  of  getting  a  case  requiring  over  a  three-day  jury  trial  is \nalready  incorporated  and  theoretically  compensated  in  the  system,  it \nis  the  unwritten  policy  of  the  chief  judge  of  the  Detroit  Recorder’s \nCourt  to  award  $800  per  day  for  each  trial  day  exceeding  the  three- \nday  average.  This  is  not  the  policy  of  the  chief  judge  of  the  Third \nCircuit  Court,  however;  there  an  attorney  is  forced  to  file  an  applica- \ntion  for  extraordinary  fees. \n13  Specifically,  the  respondents  sought  to  design  a  system  to  induce \nthose  cases  that  were  going  to  plead  anyway,  to  plead  earlier  in  the \ncriminal  process,  preferably  at  the  arraignment  on  the  information. \nThe  respondents  contend  that  the  fixed-fee  schedule  greatly  enhances \nthe  probability  of  settling  cases  by  plea,  because  paying  assigned \ncounsel  the  same  fee,  regardless  of.disposition,  provides  an  “incen- \ntive”  to  assigned  counsel  to  look  harder  at  cases  earlier  so  that \nmeaningful  plea  discussions  can  occur. \n \n  \n”  ¢ c  oo on = aera.

The  fee \nsystem  expressly  permits  assigned  counsel  to  peti- \ntion  the  chief  judges  of  the  respective  courts  for \npayment  of  extraordinary  fees  in  cases  requiring \nabove-average  effort.\" \nPetitioning  for  extraordinary  fees  is  not  a  partic- \nularly  difficult  procedure.  Assigned  counsel  need \nonly  send  a  request  for  such  fees  on  ordinary \nstationery  and  attach  it  to  the  payment  voucher \nfor  the  relevant  case.“  However,  “alll  petitions  for \nextraordinary  fees  must  include  an  analysis  of  all \nassigned  cases  for  the  previous  one  year.”  Execu- \ntive  Chief  Judge  Kaufman  described  the  reason  for \nrequiring  this  analysis  as  follows: \n  \nThe  reason  for  that  provision  is  this;  that  when \nthe  Flat-Fee  amount  was  set  in  the  schedule,  it \nwas  done  based  upon  the  historical  average  of \n \nwhat  we  had  paid  for  those  particular  charges \nwhen  we  had  a  per  event  schedule.  Since  we \nadopted  a  Flat-Fee  that  was  the  average,  if,  1n  fact, \nthose  were  reasonable  amounts,  assuming  for  a \nmoment  that  under  the  per  event  schedule  what \nwe  were  paying  were  reasonable  amounts,  then \nthat  meant  that  what  we  would  pay  attorneys  on \n  \n14The  petition  for  extraordinary  fees  is  a  procedural  device  that \nallows  assigned  counsel  an  opportunity  to  rebut  the  presumption  of \nreasonable  compensation  with  proof  that  payment  of  the  scheduled \n‘fees  fails  to  reasonably  compensate  for  the  services  required  in  any \nparticular  case.  Counsel  is  paid  at  a  rate  of  $80  per  hour.  Entitlement \nto  such  fees  is,  however,  completely  discretionary  with  the  chief \njudges  and  depends,  at  least  in  part,  on  an  analysis  of  the  amount  of \nwork  required  in  other  cases  that  a  given  attorney  was  assigned \nthroughout  the  year. \n15 While  both  courts  permit  assigned  counsel  to  file  petitions  for \nextraordinary  fees,  the  specific  method  of  dealing  with  the  petitions \nonce  filed  varies,  depending  on  whether  the  case  is  technically  under \nthe  jurisdiction  of  the  Third  Circuit  Court  or  the  Detroit  Recorder’s \nCourt.  For  instance,  petitions  for  extraordinary  fees  filed  in  Record- \ner’s  Court  are  first  considered  by  the  judge  who  presided  in  the  case, \nwhile  petitions  filed  in  the  Third  Circuit  Court  are  decided  exclusively \nby  the  chief judge  without  input  from  presiding judges. \n  \n  \nthe  Flat-Fee  Schedule  would  be  too  high  or  more \nthan  what  they  were  getting  under  the  per  event \nschedule.  The  basic  idea  being,  that  if,  in  fact,  you \nreceived  twenty  assignments  under  the  Flat-Fee \nSchedule,  just  to  give  a  hypothetical  situation,  that \neach  case  was  dismissed  after  the  exam,  or  you \nwaive  the  exam  and  the  case  got  dismissed  after  a \nhalf  hour  appearance  at  the  [arraignment  on  the \ninformation],  you  could  have  no  more  than  two  or \nthree  hours  invested  in  the  case  and  get  seven \nhundred  and  fifty  dollars.  Well,  that’s  a  couple \nhundred  dellars  an  hour.  If,  in  fact,  that  was  the \nsituation  for  ten  cases,  it  did  not  seem  fair,  to  me, \nor  to  the  joint  executive  of  the  court  who  adopted \nthis  joint  administrative  order,  to  say  that  you  can \nget  overpaid  in  these  other  cases,  but  when  you \nget  the  one  case  that  you’ve  got  to  put  some  extra \ntime  in,  you’re  allowed  extraordinary  fees  without \nany  analysis  of  the  total  of  your  assignments. \nThis  rule  is  not  strictly  enforced.  Thus,  the  failure \n    \nto  include  an  analysis  of  fees  earned  in  other  cases \nduring  the  year  in  which  extraordinary  fees  are \nsought  will  not  necessarily  preclude  recovery  of \nextraordinary  fees.  The  absence  of  such  analysis, \nhowever,  is  often  used  to  justify  an  award  of \nextraordinary  fees  lower  than  that  requested. \nHI \nAs  stated  in  State  v  Rush,  46  NJ  399,  404;  217 \nA2d  441  (1966),  “[w]le  are  here  concerned  with  the \nburden  of  supplying  the  indigent  with  a  free  de- \nfense.”  At  common  law,  this  burden  was  borne  by \nmembers  of  the  bar  as  part  of  the  obligations \nassumed  upon  admission  to  practice  law.  Id.  In- \ndeed,  this  Court  held  in  1850  that  appointed  coun- \nsel  had  no  right  to  compensation  for  representing \nindigent  criminal  defendants.  Bacon  v  Wayne  Co, \n  \n1  Mich  461  (1850).  The  accuracy”  and  continued \nvalidity”  of  this  traditional  view  has  not,  however, \ngone  unchallenged.”  Nevertheless,  because  as- \nsigned  counsel  in  Michigan  presently  have  a  statu- \ntory  right  to  reasonable  compensation,”  we  need \nnot  reconsider  here  whether  there  may  be  an \nindependent  common-law  basis  in  this  state  for \nawarding  such  compensation  absent  a-statute  or \ncourt  rule.  See,  e.g.,  anno:  Right  of  attorney  ap- \npointed  by  court  for  indigent  accused  to,  and \ncourt’s  power  to  award,  compensation  by  public,  in \nabsence  of statute  or  court  rule,  21  ALR3d  819. \nIV \nIn  Michigan,  assigned  counsel  have  a  statutory \nright  to  compensation  for  providing  criminal  de- \nfense  services  to  the  indigent.

[MCL  775.16;  MSA \n28.1253.] \nThe  issue  in  this  case  is  whether  the  present  fixed- \nfee  system  operates  to  provide  assigned  counsel \n“reasonable  compensation  for  the  services  per- \nformed”  within  the  meaning  of  the  statute.  The \npetitioners  advance  two  arguments  in  support  of \ntheir  position  that  it  does  not:  A)  the  level  of \ncompensation  is  unreasonably  low,  and  B)  the \nfixed-fee  system  of  compensation  is  unreasonable \nper  se  because  it  fails  to  differentiate  between \nattorney  effort  and  fees  paid. \nA \n1 \n    \nThe  respondents  would  have  us  interpret  “rea- \nsonable  compensation”  as  that  “amount  necessary \nto  secure  a  sufficient  number  of  able  counsel  to \nadequately  represent  the  indigent  accused.”  The \nrespondents  assert  that  such  an  interpretation  “is \nconsistent  with  the  legislative  obligation  to  provide \nadequate  representation”  to  indigent  criminal  de- \nfendants.  We  reject  this  definition  of  “reasonable \ncompensation”  because  it  erroneously  assumes \nthat  the  statutory  purpose  underlying  assigned \ncounsels’  right  to  reasonable  compensation  was  to \nassure  that  indigent  criminal  defendants  received \neffective  assistance  of  counsel. \nAppointed  counsel  had  a  statutory  right  to  rea- \nsonable  compensation  for  services  provided  to \ncriminal  indigent  defendants  long  before  indigent \ncriminal  defendants  had  a  right,  statutory  or  oth- \n  \n”  ¢ c  oo on = aera.

Despite  these  amendments,  however,  the \nstatute  remained  worded  in  a  manner  not  suggesting  that  the  legisla- \ntion  was  enacted  to  grant  a  right  to  indigents  for  appointed  counsel. \n23 The  statute  as  amended  by  1957  PA  256  provided  in  pertinent \n_  part: \nWhenever  any  person  charged  with  having  committed  any \nfelony  or  misdemeanor  shall  be  unable  to  procure \ncounsel  ...  the  presiding judge  shall  appoint  some  attorney  to \nconduct  the  ...  defense  and  the  attorney  so  appointed  shall \nbe  entitled  to  receive  from  the  county  treasurer  ...  such  an \n  \n  \nto  “reasonable  compensation  for  the  services  per- \nformed”  in  the  defense  of  criminal  indigent  defen- \ndants,  unlimited  by  any  statutory  maximum  rate, \nfor  thirty  years.” \nOur  task,  of  course,  is  to  ascertain  and  give \neffect  to  the  intent  of  the  Legislature.  Storey  v \nMeijer,  Inc,  481  Mich  368,  376;  429  NW2d  169 \n(1988).  Because  appointed  counsel’s  statutory  right \nto  compensation  existed  before  indigent  criminal \ndefendants  had  a  right  to  appointed  counsel,  it  is \ndoubtful  that  the  legislative  purpose  underlying \nthe  attorney  compensation  provision  of  MCL \n775.16;  MSA  28.1253  was  a  desire  to  assure  that. \nan  adequate  number  of  able  attorneys  were  avail- \nable  to  effectuate  the  indigent  defendant’s  right  to \nappointed  counsel. \n“In  ascertaining  the  intent  of  the  lawmakers, \nwhere  the  language  of  a  statute  is  of  doubtful \nmeaning,  we  may  examine  the  conditions  and \n    \ncircumstances  surrounding  its  enactment.”  State \nTreasurer  v  Wilson,  423  Mich  138,  144;  377  NW2d \n703  (1985).  In  this  regard,  we  note  that  there  is  no \nindication  that  the  original  legislation,  or  any \nsubsequent  amendment  of  the  statute,  was  moti- \nvated  by  a  belief  that  the  failure  to  provide  com- \npensation  to  appointed  counsel  made  it  either \ndifficult  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  to  obtain \nlegal  representation  or  that  indigent  criminal  de- \nfendants  were  receiving  ineffective  representation. \n  \namount  as  the  presiding  judge  shall  in  his  discretion  deem \nreasonable  compensation  for  the  services performed. \n24  See  n  22. \nIn  1968,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  decided  Gideon,  n  20 \nsupra,  which  held  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  counsel  applicable \nto  the  states  via  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Due  Process  Clause. \nAlthough  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253  was  twice  amended  after  Gideon, \n1963  PA  132;  1980  PA  506,  the  portion  of  the  statute,  concerning \nassigned  counsel’s  right  to  “reasonable  compensation  for  the  services \nperformed,”  remained,  in  all  essential  respects,  unchanged. \n  \n  \nIndeed,  this  Court  has  refused  to  find  that  attor- \nneys  would  shirk  their  professional  obligations  to \nprovide  competent  and  diligent  legal  representa- \ntion  to  any  client,  regardless  of  pay.

Malcolm  v  East \nDetroit,  487  Mich  132,  189;  468  NW2d  479  (1991). \nThus,  we  must  reject  respondents’  contention  that \nthe  legislative  purpose  underlying  the  statute’s \nattorney  compensation  provision  was  to  fulfill  the \nstate’s  obligation  to  provide  adequate  representa- \ntion  to  indigent  criminal  defendants. \n2 \nThe  petitioners  would  have  us  define  “reason- \nable  compensation”  as  the  amount  privately  re- \ntained  counsel  would  earn  for  providing  similar \n    \nservices  for  members  of  the  general  public.  We \nrefuse  to  do  so.  When  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253 \nwas  enacted,  counsel  was  provided  without  costs  to \nindigent  criminal  defendants  by  lawyers  as  part  of \ntheir  professional  obligations  assumed  upon  admis- \nsion  to  practice  law  in  this  state.  Our  review  of  the \nstatute’s  legislative  history  leads  us  to  conclude \nthat  the  impetus  underlying  the  enactment  and \nsubsequent  amendments  of  MCL  775.16;  MSA \n28.1253  was  the  Legislature’s  desire  to  relieve \nmembers  of  the  bar  of  at  least  some  of  their \nprofessional  obligation  to  provide  free  legal  ser- \nvices  to  the  indigent. \nIowa  gives  appointed  counsel  the  statutory  right \nto  compensation  equal  to  the  current  market  rate. \nThe  Iowa  Legislature  amended  its  attorney  com- \npensation  statute  to  provide  that  court-appointed \ncounsel  were  entitled  to  reasonable  “compensation \nto  be  made  on  the  basis  of  ordinary  and  customary \n  \n  \na  eet  soft ow  - i” 2 2  rat  r% Yecbeat  ere  a  cxxsh  a \ncharges  for  like  services  in  the  community.   33 \nIowa  Code  815.7;  Hulse  v  Van  Wifvat,  306  NWe2d \n707,  711  dowa,  1981)  (construing  the  statute  as \namended  to  equate  “reasonable  compensation”’ \nwith  “full  compensation”).  Although  our  Legisla- \nture  easily  could  have  provided  a  similar  definition \nfor  “reasonable  compensation,”  it  has  not  done \nso.” \n3 \nRepresentation  of  indigent  criminal  defendants \nin  the  Third  Circuit  Court  and  the  Detroit  Record- \ner’s  Court  is  completely  voluntary.  Therefore,  un- \nlike  the  courts  of  other  states  that  have  considered \nan  involuntarily  appointed  attorney’s  right  to  com-. \npensation,”  we  decline,  at  this  time,  to  establish \n  \n25 While  a  chief judge  certainly  could  elect  to  pay  assigned  counsel   \nthe  current  market  rate  for  similar  legal  services,  the  refusal  to  pay \nsuch  rates  is  not  necessarily  violative  of  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253. \n  \n26  See,  eag.,  Arnold,  n  17  supra,  p  305  (Gnvoluntarily  appointed \ncounsel  was  entitled  to  “just”  compensation,  considering  “the  experi- \nence  and  ability  of  the  attorney,  the  time  and  labor  required  to \nperform  the  legal  service  properly,  the  novelty  and  difficulty  of  the \nissues  involved,  the  fee  customarily  charged  in  the  locality  for  similar \nlegal  services,  the  time  limitations  imposed  upon  the  client’s  defense \nor  by  the  circumstances,  and  the  likelihood,  if  apparent  to  the  court, \nthat  the  acceptance  of  the  particular  employment  will  preclude  other \nemployment  by  the  lawyer”),  (After  Remand),  aff’d  sub  nom  Indepen- \ndence  Co,  supra,  p  480  (interpreting  Just”  compensation  as  being \nneither  ¢ ‘confiscatory  [njor  unreasonable”  and  may  be  less  than  an \n“attorney  would  expect  to  receive  from  a  paying  client”);  State  v \nLynch,  796  P2d  1150,  1161  (Okla,  1990)  Gnvoluntarily  appointed \ncounsel  entitled  to  reasonable  overhead  and  out-of-pocket  expenses \nplus  an  hourly  rate  “tied  to  the  salary  range  paid  to  assistant  district \nattorneys  and  the  district  attorneys”  within  the  state,  depending  “on \nthe  attorney’s  qualifications’);  White  v  Bd  of  Co  Comm’rs,  537  So  2d \n1376,  1879  (Fla,  1989)  (involuntarily  appointed  counsel  was  entitled \nonly  to  a  statutorily  set  fee  except  in  extraordinary  and  unusual  cases \nwhere  appointed  counsel  was  entitled  to  “the  local  prevailing  hourly \nrate  for  indigent  cases’);  Jewell,  n  18  supra,  pp  546-547  (involuntarily \nappointed  counsel  was  entitled  to  “at  least  $45  per  hour  for  out-of- \ncourt  work  and  $65  per  hour  for  in-court  work’);  Delisio,  n  18  supra, \np  443  Gnvoluntarily  appointed  counsel  was  entitled  to  compensation \nequal  to  that  obtainable  for  such  services  “by  the  average  competent \n  \n  \n”  ¢ c  on oe aera.  Fa.  ot Ly fo  c*  :  vel\"  wh “ nates ony a ret \nany  specific  definition  or  formula  for  determining \nor  calculating  “reasonable  compensation.”  In  the \nproper  exercise  of  its  legislative  authority,  the \nLegislature  has  “directed  the  chief  judge[s]  of  the \ncircuit  court  to  appoint  an  attorney  to  represent \nan  indigent  defendant’s  defense,  and  directed  the \ncounty  to  pay’  whatever  a  chief  judge \n“considers  ..  .  reasonable  compensation  for  the \nservices  performed.”  Frederick  v  Presque  Isle  Co \nCircuit  Judge,  489  Mich  1,  15;  476  NW2d  142 \n(1991).  There  are  fifty-six  circuits  plus  the  Detroit \nRecorder’s  Court  in  our  state  spread  throughout \neighty-three  counties  of  varying  financial  means.” \nAttorney  population  likewise  varies  from  county  to \ncounty.  Indeed,  there  is  a  potential  myriad  of  local \nconsiderations  that  will  necessarily  enter  into  the \nchief judge’s  determination  of  “reasonable  compen- \nsation.”  Thus,  what  constitutes  reasonable  com- \npensation  may  necessarily  vary  among  circuits. \n     \nB \nThe  petitioners  also  argue  that  the  present  fee \nsystem  “is  pér  se  unreasonable,  in  that  there  is  no \nrelationship  between  the  amount  of  work  per- \n  \nattorney  operating  on  the  open  market’);  State  ex  rel  Stephan,  n  18 \nsupra,  p  383  Gnvoluntarily  appointed  counsel  was  entitled  to  compen- \nsation  “at  a  rate  which  is  not  confiscatory,  considering  overhead  and \nexpenses”);  Smith  v  State,  118  NH  764,  770;  394  A2d  884  (1978) \nGnvoluntarily  appointed  counsel  was  entitled  to  whatever  compensa- \ntion  the  trial  court  might  fix,  which  should  “neither  unjustly  enrich \nnor  ...  unduly  impoverish  the  court-appointed  attorney”);  State  v \nRush,  46  NJ  399,  418;  217  A2d  441  (1966)  (involuntarily  appointed \ncounsel  was  entitled  to  “60%  of  the  fee  a  client  of  ordinary  means \nwould  pay  an  attorney  of  modest  financial  success”). \n27  Although  we  find  that  county  budgetary  concerns  are  appropriate \nconsiderations  in  the  determination  of  “reasonable  compensation,” \nsuch  considerations  should  seldom,  if  ever,  be  controlling.  The  coun- \nties  have  a  duty  to  fund  whatever  the  chief  judge,  in  the  exercise  of \nsound  discretion,  deems  appropriate. \n \n  \nformed  and  the  amount  of  fee  to  be  paid  to  the \nattorney.”  To  determine  whether  “reasonable  com- \npensation”  requires  some  relationship  between  ser- \nvices  performed  and  the  amount  of  compensation \nactually  paid,  we  must  again  look  to  the  statute. \nMCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253  provides  in  pertinent \npart: \nThe  attorney  appointed  by  the  court  shall  be \nentitled  to  receive  from  the  county  treasurer,  on \nthe  certificate  of  the  chief  judge  that  the  services \nhave  been  rendered,  the  amount  which  the  chief \njudge  considers  to  be  reasonable  compensation  for \nthe  services  performed.  [Emphasis  added. ] \nAs  previously  noted,  the  purpose  of  statutory \nconstruction  is  to  ascertain  and  give  effect  to  the \nintent  of  the  Legislature  in  enacting  this  statute. \nStorey,  supra,  p  376.  The  terms  of  the  statute  are \nclear  and  unambiguous.  Where  the  statute  is  clear \n \nand  unambiguous,  the  intent  of  the  Legislature  in \nenacting  the  statute  is  to  be  garnered  from  the \nlanguage  of  the  statute  itself.  Id.;  Achtenberg  v \nEast  Lansing,  421  Mich  765,  770;  364  NW2d  277 \n(1985)  (tating  that  “[wlhen  the  language  of  a \nstatute  is  clear,  courts  must  apply  it  as  written”’). \nApplying  these  principles,  we  find  that  in  enact- \ning  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253,  the  Legislature \nclearly  intended  an  individualized  determination \nof  reasonable  compensation  for  only  then  is  it \nassured  that  “the  attorney”  is  being  reasonably \ncompensated  ‘for  the  services  performed.”  Altman \nv  Meridian  Twp,  489  Mich  628,  635;  487  NW2d  155 \n(1992)  (quoting  Baker  v  General  Motors  Corp,  409 \nMich  6389,  665;  297  NW2d  887  [1980])  (‘Every  | \nword  of  a  statute  should  be  given  meaning  and  no \nword  should  be  treated  as  surplusage  or  rendered \n.  nugatory  if  at  all  possible’  ’’). \nWe  do  not  mean  to  suggest  that  the  statute \n  \n  \nrequires  the  mechanical  calculation  of  “reasonable  — \ncompensation”  in  every  case.  Such  a  construction \nwould  be  unreasonable  given  the  number  of  indi- \ngent  defense  assignments  in  the  larger  counties  of \nour  state.  Cf.  Franges  v  General  Motors  Corp,  404 \nMich  590,  612;  274  NW2d  3892  (1979)  (‘statutes \nshould  be  construed  to  prevent  absurdity,  hard- \nship,  injustice  or  prejudice  to  the  public  interest”). \nNor  do  we  interpret  the  statute  to  require  any \nspecific  type  of  compensation  system  or  that  a \nfixed-fee  system  could  never  provide  reasonable \ncompensation  within  the  meaning  of  the  statute.® \nWe  simply  hold  that,  whatever  the  system  or \nmethod  of  compensation  utilized,  the  compensation \nactually  paid  must  be  reasonably  related  to  the \nrepresentational  ‘services  that  the  individual  attor- \nneys  actually  perform. \nApplying  the  statute  as  construed,  we  find  that \nthe  present  fee  system  systematically  fails  to  pro- \nvide  assigned  counsel  reasonable  compensation \n    \nwithin  the  meaning  of  MCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253. \nAs  previously  noted,  the  fixed-fee  system  was  de- \nsigned  to  pay  the  average  fee  actually  earned \nunder  the  former  event-based  fee  system  for  legal \nservices  provided  to  indigent  defendants  facing  a \nparticular  maximum  sentence.  Because  the  event- \nbased  fee  system  paid  assigned  counsel  for  repre- \nsentational  tasks  actually  performed,  attorneys \nwhose  clients  elected  to  plead  guilty  early  in  the \njudicial  process  were  generally  entitled  to  less \ncompensation  than  attorneys  whose  clients  either \nelected  to  plead  guilty  later  or  elected  to  go  to \ntrial. \nAveraging  actual  fees  paid  under  the  former \nsystem  to  arrive  at  a  lump-sum  payment,  that  is \npaid  without  regard  to  whether  a  case  is  pleaded \nguilty  or  goes  to  a  lengthy  trial,  actually  inverts \n  \n28 If  a  fixed-fee  system  is  to  be  utilized,  however,  it  must  not  operate \nto  overcompensate  some  at  the  expense  of others. \n  \n  \nthe  former  relationship  between  representational \ntasks  performed  and  fees  paid.  In  other  words,  the \nfixed-fee  system  creates  a  situation  in  which  attor- \nneys  whose  clients  plead  guilty  earlier  in  the \ncriminal  process  are  relatively  overcompensated \nfor  their  efforts  when  compared  to  the  compensa- \ntion  provided  to  attorneys  whose  clients  do  not.  In \nour  view,  neither  group  of  attorneys  are  receiving \n“reasonable  compensation”  within  the  meaning  of \nMCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253.  Indeed,  this  inverse. \nrelationship  between  effort  expended  and  fees  paid \nis  completely  at  odds  with  the  statutory  require- \nment  to  pay  assigned  counsel  for  the  services  they \nperformed.  The  statute  expressly  requires  the  pay- \nment  of  “reasonable  compensation  for  the  services \nperformed,”  no  more  and  no  less. \n2 \nDespite  the  inverted  relationship  between  effort \nexpended  and  fees  paid,  the  respondents  argue \n    \nthat  compensation  paid  under  the  fixed-fee  system \nis  “directly  related  to  the  amount  of  work  a  lawyer \nis  expected  to  perform  given  the  degree  of  serious- \nness  of  the  crime.”  We  disagree.  A  major  premise \nunderlying  the  respondents’  argument  is  that  ac- \ntual  attorney  assignments  will  allow  overall  com- \npensation  for  individual  assigned  counsel  to  mirror \nthe  “average”  paid  under  the  event-based  system. \nStated  differently,  attorneys  receiving  multiple  as- \nsignments  are  expected  to  receive  an  appropriate \nnumber  of  early  disposition  cases,  where  the  fixed \nfee  tends  to  overcompensate  assigned  counsel,  to \n“balance”  against  cases  ultimately  disposed  of \nlater  in  the  process,  where  the  fixed  fee  tends  to \nundercompensate  assigned  counsel,  so  that  the \ntotal  “average”  individual  assigned  counsel  com- \npensation  would  remain  virtually  the  same  under \neither  system. \nIf  this  indeed  were  the  case,  then  we  may  have \nreached  a  different  decision.  The  record,  however, \n  \nis  completely  devoid  of  evidence  indicating  the \nexistence  of  attorney  assignment  procedures  imple- \nmented  to  assure  individual  attorneys  receive  the \nrequisite  number  and  type  of  cases  that  would \nprovide  them  with  a  realistic  opportunity  to  “aver- \nage”  the  fees  that  they  would  have  earned  had  the \nfee  system  remained  event-based.”  Absent  such \nassignment  control  procedures,  there  is  no  assur- \nance  whatsoever  that  the  fixed  fees  operate  to \nreasonably  compensate  individual  assigned  counsel \nfor  the  services  they  perform. \n3 \nThe  respondents  also  argue  that  the  ability  of \nassigned  counsel  to  petition  for  extraordinary  fees \nprovides  a  realistic  mechanism  for  individual  de- \nterminations  of  reasonable  assigned  counsel  com- \npensation.  We  do  not  agree.  Not  only  has  the \nprocedure  proven  ineffective  to  assure  that  as- \nsigned  counsel  are  not  undercompensated  by  the \n    \nfixed  fees,  it  is  also  ineffective  in  assuring  that \nassigned  counsel  are  not  overcompensated  by  the \nfixed  fees,  and  thus  receiving  unreasonable  com- \npensation  for  their  services. \nThe  special  master  found,  and  the  record  is \nreplete  with  testimony  suggesting,  that  undercom- \npensated  attorneys  are  hesitant  to  petition  for \nextraordinary  fees,  believing  that  such  requests \neither  would  prove  futile  or  perhaps  even  ad- \nversely  affect  their  prospects  of  receiving  future \n  \n29  Unlike  those  contract  systems  that  are  designed  to  assure  as- \nsigned  counsel  a  specific  number  of  cases  to  provide  a  reasonable \nopportunity  to  “average”  reasonable  compensation  for  the  services \nperformed,  the  assignment  system  utilized  in  the  Third  Circuit  Court \nand  the  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  provides  no  such  assurance.  The \ntask  of  assigning  cases  is  rotated  on  two-week  intervals  among  the \nvarious  judges.  Typically,  the  only  information  concerning  previous \nattorney  assignments  that  is  available  to  assigning  judges  are  the \nactual  assignments  that  they  themselves  have  made.  In  other  words, \nwhen  assigning  judges  make  assignments,  they  often  do  so  without \nregard  to  the  actual  type  and  number  of  cases  that  any  particular \nattorney  has  had  from  other  judges  throughout  a  given  year. \n  \n  \nassignments.”  Perhaps  even  more  troubling,  how- \never,  is  the  lack  of  any  mechanism  designed  to \nassure  that  assigned  counsel  are  not  being  over- \ncompensated  under  the  present  system.  Unless \nassigned  counsel  files  a  petition  for  extraordinary \nfees,  and  includes  in  the  petition  an  analysis  of \ncases  handled  during  the  year,  such  overpayments \ngo  undetected. \nCommon  sense  dictates  that  only  those  attorneys \nwho  are  underpaid  will  ever  file  a  petition  for \nextraordinary  fees  and  bother  providing  the  analy- \nsis  of  cases  purportedly  required  under  the  admin- \nistrative  order.  Overcompensated  attorneys  simply \nwill  either  refuse  to  file  petitions  for  extraordinary \nfees  or  file  them  but  fail  to  provide  the  required \n  \nsupporting  documentation. \nVv \nFor  superintending  control  to  lie,  the  petitioners \n \nmust  establish  that  the  respondents  have  failed  to \nperform  a  clear  legal  duty  and  the  absence  of  an \nadequate  legal  remedy.  MCR  3.802(B);  Frederick, \nsupra,  pp  14-15. \nMCL  775.16;  MSA  28.1253  imposes  a  duty  on  the \nchief  judges  of  both  the  Third  Circuit  Court  and \nthe  Detroit  Recorder’s  Court  to  authorize  the \ncounty  treasurer  to  pay  “reasonable  compensation \nfor  the  services  performed.”  Having  found  that  the \nfixed-fee  system  currently  utilized  to  establish  the \nrate  of  assigned  counsel  compensation  systemati- \ncally  fails  to  assure  that  individual  attorneys  are \n  \n30 Statistics  concerning  the  number  of  extraordinary  fee  petitions \nfiled  in  the  Third  Circuit  Court  during  1989,  and  the  actual  payments \nof  such  fees,  tend  to  support  this  testimony.  While  there  were  over \nthree  thousand  indigent  criminal  defense  assignments  made  in  the \nThird  Circuit  Court  during  1989,  there  were  only  twenty-nine  peti- \ntions  for  extraordinary  fees,  of  which  twenty-three  were  granted,  at \nleast  in  part,  for  a  total  dollar  amount  of  extraordinary  fees  paid  of \n$11,175.  This  is  approximately  1.6  percent  of  the  total  indigent \nattorney  fees  paid  for  that  year. \n  \n  \nreasonably  compensated  for  the  services  they  per- \nform,  it  necessarily  follows  that  the  chief  judges \nhave  failed  to  perform  a  clear  legal  duty,  which \nsatisfies  the  first  condition  of  the  writ. \nWe  further  find  that  the  extraordinary  fee \nmechanism  fails  to  provide  an  adequate  legal  rem- \nedy  to  cure  the  systematic  unreasonableness  of  the \ncurrent  compensation  system.  Although  under- \ncompensated  attorneys  have  the  ability  to  petition \nthe  court  for  extraordinary  fees  and,  if  they  desire, \nto  appeal  any  adverse  determination  all  the  way  to \nthis  Court,  we  find  such  a  remedy  inadequate. \nWhile  the  record  shows  that  most  of  the  relatively \nfew  applications  currently  submitted  are  granted, \nat  least  in  part,  we  strongly  suspect  that  such  a \ntrend  would  rapidly  change  if  the  number  of  appli- \ncations  required  to  assure  that  each  and  every \nattorney  is  provided  reasonable  compensation  for \ntime  and  effort  were  actually  filed.  Application \ndenials  would  likely  skyrocket,  forcing  attorneys  to \n   appeal.  And  even  if  attorneys  were  routinely   \ngranted  relief  on  appeal,  all  they  would  have  to \nlook  forward  to  is  another  appeal  after  the  next \nassignment  because  the  underlying  problem  would \nremain  unchanged.  Under  such  circumstances,  the \nlegal  remedy  is  inadequate.”  Further,  there  is \nabsolutely  no  procedure  whatsoever  that  operates \nto  remedy  the  situation  where  assigned  counsel  is \nunreasonably  compensated  because  of  overpay- \nment. \nVI \nGiven  the  failure  to  perform  a  clear  legal  duty \n  \n31  See  part  Iv(B)(3). \n32 iquitable  relief  is  routinely  granted  to  plaintiffs  on  the  basis  of \ninadequacy  of  legal  remedy  where  they  can  show  that  “[t]he  defen- \ndant  acts  in  such  a  way  that  the  plaintiff  may  be  required  to  bring \nmore  than  one  suit  to  effectuate  his  legal  remedy.”  Dobbs,  Remedies, \n§  2.5,  p  57. \n  \n  \nand  the  absence  of  an  adequate  legal  remedy,  we \nfind  that  the  exercise  of  this  Court’s  extraordinary \npower  of  superintending  control  is  justified  in  this \ncase.  Accordingly,  we  hereby  direct  the  chief \njudges  of  the  Third  Circuit  Court  and  the  Detroit \nRecorder’s  Court  to  discontinue  compensating  as- \nsigned  counsel  under  the  fixed-fee  system,  as  it \ncurrently  exists,  for  all  indigent  defense  assign- \nments  made  after  December  31,  19938,  and  to  de- \nvelop  for  implementation  on  and  after  January  1, \n1994  a  payment  system  that  reasonably  compen- \nsates  assigned  counsel  for  services  performed  con- \nsistent  with  this  opinion.  Said  plan  shall  be  filed \nwith  this  Court  on  or  before  December  1,  1998. \nLEVIN,  BricKLeY,  RILEY,  GRIFFIN,  and  MALLETT,  © \nJJ.,  concurred  with  CAVANAGH,  C.J. \nBove,  J.

Under  our  authority  to  administer  Michi- \n   gan’s  one  court  of  justice,  Const  1963,  art  6,  $1,  I \nwould  support  a  collaborative  effort  between  this \nCourt,  the  chief  judges,  and  the  local  funding  unit, \nto  discuss  and  implement  changes  in  the  funding \nsystem.
