    "summary": "<p>On March 30, 2017, an organization called Tent City Alternative to LSD Viaducts and a community resident activist submitted a Notification of Public Assembly to the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings. They requested a permit to erect tents on behalf of the homeless population, who would be displaced by construction. The City granted a permit as to the location for the duration sought, but without a provision that would allow the erection of tents. On May 17, the plaintiffs responded by filing a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County.  </p><p>On June 15, 2017, the defendant City of Chicago removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The case was assigned to Judge Sidney Schenkier. In September, the court granted a motion to change the name of the plaintiffs to The Uptown Tent City Organizers. The Uptown Tent City Organizers is an unincorporated association of community members, some of whom reside in tents under the viaducts near Lake Shore Drive. </p><p>On August 1, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 against the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings, Chicago Department of Transportation, and City of Chicago. The first amended complaint claimed that denial of the permit to erect tents violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights to public assembly, Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment, and rights under state law. The plaintiffs sought a reversal of the city's decision to deny the permit (granting the application for an assembly permit to run for a period of six months), declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs.</p><p>On August 27, the plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction to prevent the construction work from occurring that would displace the homeless community. On September 15, Judge Sidney I. Schenkier denied the motion on the basis that the government did not have the constitutional obligation to provide individuals with a place to live and the community did not have a contractual right to live under the viaducts.</p><p>On November 7, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint to add federal constitutional violations under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and a state claim of violation of the Illinois Homeless Act. The amended complaint included details of events that precipitated in September between the plaintiffs and local law enforcement. The plaintiffs again sought a reversal of the administrative hearing decision to deny the permits, declaratory relief, a permanent injunction, and attorney's fees and costs. </p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on January 19, 2018. Judge Schenkier granted this motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on June 5, 2018. The court held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to allege that any of its members would be personally harmed by the City's conduct. And the court dismissed the individual plaintiff's First Amendment claim because the plaintiff had not alleged that the proposed conduct would be expressive. Finally, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. 2018 WL 2709431. </p><p>The case is ongoing</p>",

In support of this motion, Plaintiffs \nstate as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiff Tent City Alternative to LSD Viaducts is an association that \nrepresents and advocates for the rights of individuals who live in tent communities \nlocated under the viaducts of Lake Shore Drive at Lawrence and Wilson Avenues. \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 2 of 33 PageID #:497\nPlaintiff Andy Thayer is a community activist and member of Tent City Alternative \nto LSD Viaducts. \n  On August 18, 2017, officials of the City of Chicago’s Department of \nTransportation posted a notice on the bridges of Lakeshore Drive over Wilson and \nLawrence Avenues. Ex. 1. This notice states that the site will be “closed for \nconstruction” on Monday, September 18, 2017, and will remain under construction \nand thus off limits until March 31, 2018. Id. If this notice is put into effect, the \npeople who are currently living under the viaduct will be displaced. Affiants have \nnoted the mutual protection that living in a tent community currently offers them \nthat is lacking when they are dispersed. They have noted that temporary shelters \nare not an option for them due to the physical dangers and health risks frequently \nassociated with shelters. Affiants have also noted that no shelters in the City allow \nfor the temporary housing of childless, different-sexed couples. Single Room \nOccupancy (SRO) housing is the least expensive form of permanent housing, and yet \nover 2200 units of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing on the city’s North Side \nwere lost between 2011 and 2013 alone [cite: http://chicagoreporter.com/shifting-sro-\nscene-when-housing-last-resort-disappears/], forcing up market demand, and hence \nprices, for remaining housing stock and pricing Affiants out of the market.  \n  Just in the last few weeks, Uptown learned that the last building in the \ncommunity with units affordable by someone living on social security was being \nvacated and converted into higher priced housing. Mark Brown, “Sale of cubicle \nhotel” in Uptown puts residents at risk,” Chicago Sun Times, July 21, 2017 \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 3 of 33 PageID #:498\n(http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/brown-sale-of-cubicle-hotel-in-uptown-\nputs-residents-at-risk/, last accessed August 27, 2017). This will displace hundreds \nof additional people, all of whom will be competing for shelter beds and low cost \nhousing, thus further driving up the price and reducing availability.  \nIn April 2017, the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless has estimated that \nbased on the 2015 U.S. census, 82,212 are homeless in the City of Chicago. The Chicago \nPublic Schools identified that 18,117 of its registered students were homeless during the \n2016-17 school year. http://www.chicagohomeless.org/faq-studies/ As Plaintiffs’ second \npublic assembly application noted, “With repairs of the Lake Shore Drive bridge viaducts \nscheduled…the homeless who currently reside there will need a place to stay, given that the \nCity has proven unable or unwilling to house them.”   \nThe Plaintiffs have identified an alternative location at which they seek to \nestablish a tent community—the publicly owned parkway in front of the now-\nshuttered Stewart Elementary School, 4525 N. Kenmore Avenue that beginning on \nSeptember 26, 2016 has been periodically blocked by fencing erected by a private \ncontractor—and have applied for a public assembly permit to do so under §10-8-334 \nof the Municipal Code of Chicago.1 The City denied this permit, citing unspecified \n“safety” concerns. Plaintiffs appealed the City’s denial, seeking to use the area. Two \ndays before the appeal hearing, Attorney Kelly Gandursky, representing the City, \nsaid the erection of the fencing by the contractor was “illegal” as it was not in the \narea for which the contractor had a permit. Gandurski said they had forced the \n                                                         \n1 Hereinafter cited as “MC §.” \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 4 of 33 PageID #:499\ncontractor to take down the fence and asked Plaintiff to withdraw his appeal. Upon \nverifying that the fence had been removed, Plaintiffs withdrew  their appeal. Within \nhours, the fence was re-erected. Plaintiffs thus reinstated their appeal. The fence \nwas removed again on the eve of the hearing, and the City successfully moved for \nthe appeal to be denied on the grounds of “mootness.” The same day, Plaintiffs \napplied for another, very similar public assembly permit for the same location, this \ntime also indicating that Plaintiffs would be erected tents for the homeless. The \nCity denied the permit without citing any safety concerns. This time the City said \nthat while the time and place of the 1st Amendment activity were fine, the manner \nin the form of erecting tents required an additional public way use permit under MC \n§10-28-010 and that erecting tents without such a permit was “an illegal act.”  \nPublic way use permits require the passage of a special ordinance by the City \nCouncil and Mayor for each instance of such use. MC §10-28-015. The City’s own \nexpert witness admitted in his testimony that never in his experience had the City \ninsisted on homeless individuals applying for and receiving a public way use permit \nin order to erect tents. Plaintiffs’ public assembly permit was nonetheless denied on \nthe grounds that they had not applied for a public way use permit in addition to the \npublic assembly permit. It was this denial that led to the present suit.  \n  Plaintiffs bring this motion to preliminarily preserve the status quo by \nenjoining the City of Chicago from enforcing the 30-day notice until such time as at \nleast one of the following conditions is met:  \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 5 of 33 PageID #:500\na.  the public assembly permit for Plaintiffs to establish a tent community \nat the Stewart School site is granted (even if on a temporary basis, \npending final resolution of this case); \nb.  Plaintiffs and others affected by the Order are provided permanent \nhousing; or \nc.  The parties are able to agree upon an alternative location that both \nprovides a safe place for Plaintiffs and others affected by the removal \nnotice to stay, and has similar visibility to the current viaduct site \nand/or the Stewart School site. \n \n  As set forth below, Plaintiffs meet the criteria for obtaining preliminary \ninjunctive relief to bar the City from enforcing its 30-day notice. First, Plaintiffs \nshow that they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims \nthat: (1) the City’s plan to reconstruct the Wilson and Lawrence bridges without \nproviding alternative housing for the Plaintiffs and/or approving their application \nfor a public  assembly permit to establish a tent community at the Stewart School \nsite violates the Eighth Amendment by criminalizing the status of homelessness; (2) \nthe City’s planned removal of Plaintiffs from their current location, coupled with \ntheir denial of Plaintiffs’ public assembly permit application and failure to provide a \nsimilarly visible alternative location in the manner applied for violates Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1, Section 5 \nof the Illinois Constitution; and (3) the City’s planned removal of Plaintiffs from \ntheir current location violates their rights under the Illinois Bill of Rights for the \nHomeless Act. Second, Plaintiffs show that they lack an adequate remedy at law \nand will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. Third, Plaintiffs \nshow that the balance of harms tips in favor of granting the injunctive relief \nrequested. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 6 of 33 PageID #:501\nARGUMENT \nI.  Preliminary Injunction Standard \n  In the Seventh Circuit, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish four elements: (1) some likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the lack of \nan adequate remedy at law; (3) a likelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm if \nthe injunction is not granted; and (4) that the balance of hardships tips in the \nmoving party’s favor. Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. \n2001). In the analysis below, Plaintiffs shows, first, that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their claims. Next, Plaintiffs show \nthat they satisfy the three criteria for obtaining injunctive relief. \nII.  Plaintiffs Have a Likelihood of Success on the Merits of Their Claims \n \nA.   The City’s Removal Notice, Along with the Denial of the Public \nUse Permit, Violates the Eighth Amendment \n \n  The “Cruel and Unusual Punishments” Clause of the Eighth Amendment \n“imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such.” \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667-68 (1977). The Supreme Court has explained \nthat laws that criminalize an individual’s status, rather than his conduct, violate \nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). In Robinson, the Court found unconstitutional a \nstate law that made it a criminal offense to be addicted to illegal narcotics. The \nCourt noted that the statute made an addicted person “continuously guilty of this \noffense, whether or not he had ever used or possessed any narcotics within the \nState”—and further that addiction is a status “which may be contracted innocently \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 7 of 33 PageID #:502\nor involuntarily,” given that “a person may even be a narcotics addict from the \nmoment of his birth.” The Court found that the statute impermissibly criminalized \nthe status of addiction and, therefore, constituted cruel and unusual punishment. \nId. at 666-67 & n.9.  \n  In Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), the Court applied the principles of \nRobinson to the question of whether conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of \none’s status can be criminalized consistent with the Eighth Amendment. In Powell, \nthe Court considered the constitutionality of a law that made “public intoxication” a \ncrime. A four-member plurality interpreted Robinson narrowly as prohibiting only \ncriminalization of status and noted that the public intoxication statute criminalized \nconduct—being intoxicated in public—rather than the status of being addicted to \nalcohol. Id. at 534 (plurality opinion). The dissenting justices interpreted Robinson \nmore broadly, concluding that the Eighth Amendment protects against \ncriminalization not solely of one’s status, but also of conduct that a person is \n“powerless to avoid” due to his status. Id. at 567 (dissenting opinion). Noting that \ndue to his alcohol addiction, Mr. Powell was powerless to avoid public drunkenness, \nthe dissenting justices would have reversed Mr. Powell’s conviction on Eighth \nAmendment grounds. Id. at 569-70. \n  Justice White, who concurred in the result, wrote a separate opinion in which \nhe set forth a different interpretation of Robinson. Justice White concluded that the \noperative question should be the “voluntariness” of the conduct in question. Id. at \n548-51 (White, J., concurring). Under this analysis, if sufficient evidence is \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 8 of 33 PageID #:503\npresented showing that the prohibited conduct was involuntary due to one’s status, \ncriminalization of that conduct would be impermissible under the Eighth \nAmendment. Id. at 551. In reaching this decision, Justice White specifically \ncontemplated the application of criminal laws to homeless individuals who have no \nchoice but to engage in activities of life in public places. He explained that, “[f]or all \npractical purposes the public streets may be home for these unfortunates, not \nbecause their disease compels them to be there, but because, drunk or sober, they \nhave no place else to go and no place else to be when they are drinking.” Id. Justice \nWhite believed some alcoholics who are homeless could show that “resisting \ndrunkenness is impossible and that avoiding public places when intoxicated is also \nimpossible.” Id. For these individuals, the statute “is in effect a law which bans a \nsingle act for which they may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment—the \nact of getting drunk.” Id.  \n  The Ninth Circuit adopted Justice White’s framework in Jones v. City of Los \nAngeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006). In Jones the court found an ordinance that \ncriminalized “sitting, lying, or sleeping on public streets and sidewalks at all times \nand in all places within Los Angeles's city limits” was unconstitutional as applied to \nhomeless individuals who are “sitting, lying, or sleeping in Los Angeles’s Skid Row \nbecause they cannot obtain shelter.” Id. at 1136. See also Johnson v. City of Dallas, \n860 F. Supp. 344, 350 (N.D. Tex. 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 61 F.3d 442 (5th Cir. \n1995) (finding anti-camping ordinance violated Eighth Amendment because it \ncriminalized sleeping in public when homeless individuals had no other choice but \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 9 of 33 PageID #:504\nto sleep in public, and therefore criminalized the status of homelessness itself); \nPottinger v. City of Miami, 810 F. Supp. 1551, 1563 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (same).2  \n  Pursuant to this case law, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success \non their claim that the MC §10-28-010, as applied to Plaintiffs, violates the Eighth \nAmendment because it results in criminalization of the status of people who are \nhomeless. Under MC §10-28-010, subsection (b), “Unless otherwise authorized by \nthis code, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or maintain any of \nthe following on, under or above the public way without a public way use permit \nauthorized by ordinance passed by the city council.” [emphasis ours] \nMoreover, under MC §10-28-010(a)(3), “An application for a public way use permit \nshall be made to the department and shall include the following: …. proof of the \nrequired insurance. \n  The City makes it illegal to erect a tent on public property (regardless of \nwhether doing so obstructs other users of the public way) without first obtaining a \npublic use permit pursuant to MC §10-28-010. To obtain such a permit, the \napplicant must first secure passage of a special ordinance by the City Council, such \nas those used to authorize sidewalk cafes or awnings over the public sidewalk. \nThen, the applicant has to buy an insurance policy to cover the public way use, or \n                                                         \n2   The Department of Justice has consistently taken the position that that \ncriminalizing sleeping in public when no shelter is available violates the Eighth \nAmendment by criminalizing the status of being homeless. See, Statement of Interest, Bell \nv. City of Boise, No. 09-cv-540 (D. Idaho, August 6, 2015); Brief for the United States as \nAmicus Curiae, Joyce v. City and County of San Francisco, No. 95-16940 (9th Cir. Mar. 29, \n1996); Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, No. S03850 \n(Cal.

These onerous requirements make it virtually \nimpossible for an indigent person to obtain a public use permit for the purpose of \nerecting a temporary shelter such as a tent.  \n  At the same time, homeless individuals such as Plaintiffs have no option but \nto live in tent encampments such as those currently located under the viaducts or \nthe proposed Stewart School site. This is so because, through no volitional act of \ntheir own, they are unable to obtain housing. Ms. Alisa Rodriquez, Deputy \nCommissioner for the homeless programs of the City of Chicago Department of \nFamily and Support Services, the City’s witness in the Administrative Hearing3 \nagreed, under cross-examination, that there were insufficient beds in shelters to \nhouse the homeless population of Chicago based on the number of homeless \nindividuals in the report of the Chicago Coalition on the Homeless. Transcript of the \nAppeals Hearing before Senior Administrative Law Judge Frank Lombardo on April \n12, 2017, Case No. 17 PA 000002, page 166 lines 19-24.4  Plaintiffs are thus exposed \nto potential arrest and/or citation for violation of the municipal code every day for \nsimply carrying out life-sustaining tasks such as sleeping in a temporary shelter \nsuch as a tent.

P __, L ____. \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 11 of 33 PageID #:506\nB.  The City’s Removal Notice, Along with the Denial of the Public \nAssembly Permit, Violates the First Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution and Article 1, Section 5 of the Illinois Constitution \n \n  The existing encampments under the Lake Shore Drive bridges in Uptown \nnot only provide community residents with a safe place to stay out of the weather, \nbut they do so in a location which is highly visible to the thousands of people who \nuse Lincoln Park every week. On March 29, 2016, the City of Chicago held a \nmeeting at Clarendon Park Fieldhouse with members of the tent encampments and \nother interested parties. The purpose of the meeting was to announce a pilot \nprogram to find permanent housing for everyone living in the encampments. During \nthe meeting, the City admitted that the reason it was offering this program to the \nresidents of the Uptown encampments was that they were so visible. That visibility \nplays an important First Amendment function of dramatizing the dire situation of \nthe tens of thousands of homeless people in Chicago—so that “out of sight” will not \nmean “out of mind.” The location of the assembly which is the subject of this case is \nsimilarly visible—directly across the street from the Alderman’s office, and in front \nof a closed school which is being converted into expensive residential lofts. The \nCity’s denial of plaintiffs’ permit application thus deprives plaintiffs of their right to \nspeak in an effective manner, a right protected by the First Amendment.  \n  Under established case law, public authorities may limit the application of \nthe public assembly provision of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution on the \ngrounds of “time” “place” and “manner.” Article 1, Section 5 of the Illinois \nConstitution, however, limits public authorities’ power to use “manner” restrictions \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 12 of 33 PageID #:507\non public assemblies by explicitly adding in protections for what it calls “non-\nexpressive” assemblies.  \nUnder MC §10-8-334, the City is required to offer an alternative location and \ntime for applications that it rejects. In the case of Plaintiffs’ second application, as \npart of the City’s rejection, it stated that Plaintiffs would be permitted to assemble \nin the exact same time and place as requested on their application – but without \ntents. Hence, only the City’s right to reject public assemblies based upon manner is \nat issue. As with the City’s specious “public safety” objections to Plaintiffs’ first \npublic assembly application, the City is concocting a manner objection due to the \nfact that Plaintiffs work with and/or are homeless themselves. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ \nproposal to erect tents is precisely the kind of “non-expressive” assembly \ncontemplated by Article 1, Section 5 of the Illinois Constitution. \n  Plaintiffs’ permit application was for a parkway open to the public. \nOriginally, this was a public street; however, the street was closed and converted to \na pedestrian mall as part of the expansion of the campus of Stewart Elementary \nSchool. When the school was closed in the summer of 2013, the parkway became \nfully accessible to the public. While the City sold the school building to a private \ndeveloper, it has admitted (see Statement of Facts) that the developer had no right \nto use the parkway. It thus remains open to the public. As a public parkway, it is a \ntraditional forum for public speech. As such, restrictions on speech in that forum \nare subject to strict scrutiny. Choose Life Ill., Inc. v. White, 547 F.3d 853, 864 (7th \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 13 of 33 PageID #:508\nCir. 2008), citing Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45, \n103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983).  \n  Under strict scrutiny analysis, \"[t]he government may 'exclude a speaker \nfrom a . . . public forum only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling \nstate interest and the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.'\"  \nChristian Legal Soc'y v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 865 (7th Cir. 2006) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 \nU.S. 666, 677, 118 S. Ct. 1633, 140 L. Ed. 2d 875 (1998)). Stated differently: \n[T]he time, place, and manner of a speaker's activities can be regulated \nwithout violating the First Amendment so long as the restrictions are \n(1) content-neutral, (2) narrowly tailored to serve a significant \ngovernment interest, and (3) leave open ample alternative channels for \ncommunication. \n \nMarcavage v. City of Chicago, 659 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir. 2011). \n \n  As noted in the Statement of Facts, the City’s only reason for denying \nplaintiffs’ permit application was that erecting tents on the parkway would violate \nthe law barring construction of a “structure” on the public way, in the absence of a \nCity Ordinance (and the required insurance) for doing so. The City’s interpretation \nof the word “structure” to include a tent is inherently suspicious5. However, the \n                                                         \n5 Counsel believes that the City does not require such an ordinance for the hundreds of \ntemporary tents erected at the innumerable street festivals held in Chicago every year (or \nfor that matter, the tents erected every week on the federal plaza across the street from this \ncourthouse or in front of the Daly Center courthouse for “Farmers Markets”. For example, \nthe City’s permit application for ‘Special Events” clearly states, in bold red ink, that a “tent \npermit” is required only if the tent will be over 400 square feet. None of the tents at issue \nin this case are that large. City of Chicago Special Events Permit Package, p. 4 \n(https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dca/Neighborhood%20Festivals/Permi\ntPacket2016.pdf, last visited August 27, 2017). \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 14 of 33 PageID #:509\nCourt need not delve into the issue of statutory construction, because the City \nadmitted (Doc. 9, Admin. Record, p. 36) that no permit had ever been granted to \nhomeless people living in tents. The City further admitted that no tent under the \nWilson and Lawrence bridges had ever posed any sort of safety hazard (id, at 41). \nThe City has thus admitted that it has no compelling interest served by denying \nplaintiffs’ application for a public assembly permit. \nC.  The City’s Removal Notice Violates The Illinois Bill of Rights \nfor the Homeless Act  \n \n  The Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act was passed on August 22, \n2013. Illinois is one of only three states, along with Connecticut and Rhode Island, \nto pass legislation codifying the civil and human rights of homeless people. The \nstatute’s legislative intent states: \nIt is the long-standing policy of this State that no person should suffer \nunnecessarily from cold or hunger, be deprived of shelter or the basic \nrights incident to shelter, or be subject to unfair discrimination based \non his or her homeless status. At the present time, many persons have \nbeen rendered homeless as a result of economic hardship, a severe \nshortage of safe and affordable housing, and a shrinking social safety \nnet. It is the intent of this Act to lessen the adverse effects and \nconditions caused by the lack of residence or a home. \n \n  The Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless defines homelessness as “status of \nhaving or not having a fixed or regular residence, including the status of living on \nthe streets, in a shelter, or in a temporary residence.” 775 ILCS 45/10(b). Among the \nrights that homeless people are entitled to in Illinois are “the right to use and move \nfreely in public spaces, including but not limited to public sidewalks, public parks, \npublic transportation, and public buildings, in the same manner as any other \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 15 of 33 PageID #:510\nperson and without discrimination on the basis of his or her housing status,” and \n“the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her personal property to \nthe same extent as personal property in a permanent residence.” 775 ILCS \n45/10(a)(1), (7).  \n  These two provisions stand for the proposition that homeless individuals \nshould not be (a) forced to obtain a tent permit that burdens them on the basis of \ntheir housing status, and (b) have their property (including tents) displaced from \npublic land. In this case, as discussed at length in the two prior sections, the City \ngranted plaintiffs’ permit application to use the space in front of Stewart School for \nany assembly EXCEPT one involving tents. Since homeless people need to sleep \nsomewhere, this limitation effectively bars them from using the Stewart mall to \nprotest, while allowing any housed person (who can of course go home at night) to \nuse the space. This is exactly the sort of disparate treatment which constitutes \nprohibited discrimination under the Homeless Bill of Rights.  \n  In sum, Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits on \neach of their three claims in this case sufficient to warrant granting a preliminary \ninjunction. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Meet the Other Criteria to Obtain Preliminary Injunctive \nRelief \n \n  As explained above, in order to prevail on a motion for preliminary \ninjunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) some likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) that he lacks an adequate remedy at law; and (3) a likelihood that he will \nsuffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted.

If \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 16 of 33 PageID #:511\nthese conditions are met, a court must then balance the hardships the moving party \nwill suffer in the absence of relief against those the nonmoving party will suffer if \nthe injunction is granted.

A court weighs all these factors “sitting as would a \nchancellor in equity,” using a “‘sliding scale’ approach: the more likely it is the \nplaintiff will succeed on the merits, the less the balance of irreparable harms need \nweigh towards its side; the less likely it is the plaintiff will succeed, the more the \nbalance need weigh towards its side.” Abbott Labs v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d \n6, 11 (7th Cir. 1992). \nA.   Plaintiffs Lack an Adequate Remedy at Law and Will Suffer \nIrreparable Harm if an Injunction Is Not Granted \n \n  Where, as here, deprivation of a constitutional right is alleged, “most courts \nhold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.” Ezell v. City of \nChicago, 651 F.3d 684, 699 (7th Cir. 2011) (quoting Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure §2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)). However, as set forth above, \nindividuals currently living in tent encampments impacted by the City’s planned \nconstruction will suffer severe harm if the City is not enjoined from enforcing its 30-\nday removal notice. They will be deprived of a safe community out of the weather; \nthey will be deprived of a space which highlights their plight. Further, many \nresidents will not even be able to relocate to shelters dispersed throughout the City, \neither because they are not eligible, or because there are not sufficient beds.  \nB.   The Balance of Harms Weighs in Favor of Granting Plaintiff \nthe Relief Requested \n \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 17 of 33 PageID #:512\n  There is no evidence that the public interest will be harmed if the Court \ngrants the preliminary injunctive relief they have requested. First, the public has a \npowerful interest in protecting constitutional rights that is well served by granting \ninjunctive relief here. See, ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589-90 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(“[T]he public interest is not harmed by preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of a \nstatute that is probably unconstitutional.”) Second, there is no reason to believe \nthat there is any risk to public safety posed by allowing the people currently living \nunder the viaducts to either remain where they are or move their tent encampment \nto the Stewart School site. As set forth in the attached declarations, the existing \nencampments are long standing communities that have not posed any danger to the \ncommunity in which they are located. Likewise, the Stewart School site currently \nstands vacant and unused. Allowing Plaintiffs to relocate to that site would pose no \nobstruction of the public way or other public safety risks.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For all of the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this \nHonorable Court grant a preliminary injunction barring the City from enforcing the \n30-day notice until such time as at least one of the following conditions is met:  \na.  the public assembly permit for Plaintiffs to establish a tent community \nat the Stewart School site is granted (even if on a temporary basis, \npending final resolution of this case); \nb.  Plaintiffs and others affected by the Order are provided permanent \nhousing; or \nc.  The parties are able to agree upon an alternative location that both \nprovides a safe place for Plaintiffs and others affected by the removal \nnotice to stay, and has similar visibility to the current viaduct site \nand/or the Stewart School site. \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 18 of 33 PageID #:513\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Alan Mills \n/s/ Molly Armour \n/s/ Jeffrey Frank \n/s/ Adele D.

Schenkier \nCITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF  ) \nADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS, CITY OF  ) \nCHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF  ) \nTRANSPORTATION, and CITY OF  ) \nCHICAGO,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER' \nThis lawsuit centers on the plight of homeless residents of the City of Chicago (\"the \nCity\"),  specifically  those  who  have  at  some  point  resided  in  the  City's  Uptown \nneighborhood.  From  July  through  September  2016,  twenty  to  thirty  homeless  people \nresided in tents in front of a former elementaty school at 4525 North Kenmore Avenue \n(referred to herein as \"Stewart Mall\") in Uptown. On September 26, 2016, the City fenced \noff Stewart Mall, and some of the homeless people who had been living there relocated \ntheir  tents  under  the  Lake  Shore  Drive  (\"LSD\")  viaducts  at  Wilson  and  Lawrence \nA venues in Uptown. Over the next year, the number of homeless people living under the \nviaducts fluctuated. By mid-September 2017, approximately 20 to 25 people lived in tents \nunder the viaducts. \n10n July 5, 2017, by consent of the parties and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Local Rule 73.1, this \ncase was assigned to this Court for all proceedings, including entry of final judgment (doc. # 18). \n\nIn March 2017, plaintiff Andy Thayer, a 30-year resident of Uptown who is  not \nhimself homeless, filed a \"notification of public assembly\" with the Chicago Department \nof Transportation (\"CDOT\"), pursuant to Municipal Code of Chicago (\"MCC\") § 10-8-\n334, on behalf of himself and plaintiff Uptown Tent City Organizers (\"UTCO\") (Compl., \n,  7; doc.# 1: Notice ofRemoval, Ex. A: 04/17/2017 Admin. Decis. at 6-8)_2 Mr. Thayer \nsought permission to \"erect a tent city\" on Stewart Mall for approximately seven months \nbecause the City needed to perform construction work on the viaducts (Jd.).3  The City \ndenied Mr.  Thayer's request,  and the denial was  affitmed in  a written decision by  an \nAdministrative Law Judge  (\"ALJ\")  on April  17,  2017  (Compl., ,, 30-31;  04117/2017 \nAdmin. Decis. at 6-8). Mr. Thayer and UTCO sought administrative review in state court, \nand on June 15, 2017, defendants removed the case to federal court. \nPlaintiffs did not challenge the removal of their administrative review complaint to \nfederal court. Rather, on August 1, 2017, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding to \ntheir claim for administrative review claims alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment, \nFirst Amendment, and the Illinois Homeless Act (doc. # 23: First Am. Compl., ,, 72-86). \nPlaintiffs assetied that this Comi had federal question jurisdiction over the federal claims \nunder 28 U.S.C.  § 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over the \nstate law claims (Jd., ,, 2-3). Before construction work on the viaducts was due to begin, \nplaintiffs moved to enjoin the City from beginning construction until they were granted a \npermit to assemble their tents on Stewart Mall, were provided permanent housing, or were \ngiven an alternative safe and visible location to set up their tents  (doc.  # 25:  Mot.  for \n2Piaintiffs initially referred to UTCO as \"Tent City Alternative to LSD Viaducts.\" On September 14, \n2017, this Court granted plaintiffs' motion to change the plaintiff's name in this case to UTCO (doc. # 39). \n3The parties all agree the viaducts were in need of repair. \n2 \n\nPrelim. Inj. at 4-5). On September 15, 2017, after a hearing, this Court denied plaintiffs' \nmotion for preliminary injunction (doc. # 43).  On September 18, 2017, the City began \nconstruction on the viaducts, and the tent residents were forced to vacate those locations. \nAfter  this  Court's  decision  denying  their  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction, \nplaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"). Plaintiffs contend that the \nCity's ordinances and actions violated:  (1) their right under local law to obtain a City \npetmit to erect and maintain tents on Stewart Mall (doc. # 48: Compl., Count I); (2) the \nFirst Amendment's guarantee of free speech and assembly (Jd., Count II); (3) the Eighth \nAmendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment (Jd.,  Count III); (4) the \nFourth Amendment's prohibition  against  illegal seizure  (Id.,  Count  IV);  (5)  the  Fifth \nAmendment's prohibition against taking private property without just compensation (Id., \nCount V); and (6) the Illinois Homeless Act (Jd., Count VI). \nDefendants have filed a motion to dismiss Counts II through VI of the Complaint \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 1) on the ground that plaintiffs lack standing \nto assert their claims, and under Rule  12(b )( 6)  for failure to  state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted (doc.# 56: Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss). The motion is now fully briefed. \nFor the reasons that follow, we grant defendants' motion to dismiss. We find that neither \nplaintiff has standing to assert the claims in Counts III through VI, and we dismiss those \nclaims under Rule 12(b )(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have standing \nto assert the claim in Count II, but the Court grants defendants' motion to dismiss Count II \nunder Rule  12(b)(6). As there is  no federal claim remaining in the case, we relinquish \njurisdiction over the local law claim in Count I pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). \n3 \n\nI. \nBefore addressing any challenge to plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim, \nthe Court must answer \"the threshold question\" of whether plaintiffs have standing to \nbring the claims they  assert.  Taylor v.  McCament,  875  F.3d 849,  855  (7th Cir.  2017). \nStanding is '\"an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of \nArticle III.\"' Swanigan v.  City of Chicago, 881  F.3d 577, 583  (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting \nLujan v. Defenders ofWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992); U.S. CONST. ati. III,§ 2, cl. 1). \n\"Standing has three elements: 'The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) \nthat is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to \nbe redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"' Matushkina v. Nielsen, 877 F.3d 289, 292-\n93  (7th Cir.  2017) (quoting Spokeo,  Inc.  v.  Robins,_ U.S._, 136  S.Ct.  1540,  1547 \n(20 16) ). \"When there are multiple plaintiffs[, a ]t least one plaintiff must have standing to \nseek each form  of relief requested in the  complaint.\" Town  of Chester,  NY  v.  Laroe \nEstates,  Inc.,  _  U.S.  _, 137  S.  Ct.  1645,  1651  (2017).  Challenges  to  standing  are \nappropriately addressed by a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(l) for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. Swanigan, 881 F.3d at 582. \nA. \nWith regard to Mr. Thayer, plaintiffs agree that he does not have standing to assert \nthe claims in Counts III through VI (doc. # 66: Pls.' Resp. at 2), and defendants do not \nchallenge his standing to asseti the claim in Count II (Defs.' Mem. at 4). We agree that \nMr. Thayer has standing to asseti that his First Amendment rights were violated in Count \nII.  In the Complaint, plaintiffs (including Mr. Thayer) contend that \"they are in fear of \nbeing ticketed [and] arrested\" if they set up a tent community (Compl.,, 75). Assuming, \n4 \n\nsolely for the purpose of considering standing, that erecting tents  constitutes protected \nspeech or expressive conduct (a question we address below, see pp.  17-20), Mr. Thayer \nhas  alleged  \"a  concrete  and  particularized  chilling  effect\"  from  the  City's  conduct \npreventing him from doing so. Bell v. Keating, 697 F.3d 445, 454-55 (7th Cir. 2012); see \nalso  Hoover  v.  Wagner,  47  F.3d  845,  847  (7th  Cir.  1995)  (\"Arrest,  prosecution,  and \nconviction are tangible harms,  and so  is  abandoning one's constitutional right of free \nspeech in order to avert those harms\"). And, the alleged chilling effect could be redressed \nby a decision in plaintiffs' favor. Therefore, Mr. Thayer has standing to assert the claim in \nCount II. See also Six Star Holdings,  LLC v.  City of Milw., 821  F.3d 795, 803 (7th Cir. \n20 16) (holding that the plaintiff had standing where it refrained from protected speech in \nresponse to the city's unconstitutional ordinances). \nB. \nThe  matter  of UTCO's  standing to  assert  the  claims  in the  Complaint requires \nadditional analysis. Defendants challenge UTCO's standing to assert each of the claims in \nCounts II through VI, while plaintiffs maintain that UTCO has standing. \nIt is UTCO' s burden -- as the party now seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction -- to \nestablish that the jurisdictional requirements have been met. Ctr. for Dermatology & Skin \nCancer,  Ltd.  v.  Burwell,  770  F.3d  586,  588-89  (7th  Cir.  2014).  \"In order to  survive \ndismissal for  lack of standing,  the plaintiffs'  complaint must contain sufficient factual \nallegations of an injury resulting from the defendants' conduct, accepted as true, to state a \nclaim for relief that is plausible on its face.\" Diedrich v.  Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, 839 \nF.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing Spokeo, 136 S.Ct. at 1548). \"District courts deciding \nsuch motions must accept as  true all material allegations of the complaint, drawing all \n5 \n\nreasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, unless standing is challenged as a \nfactual matter.\" Laurens v.  Volvo Cars ofN. Am., LLC, 868 F.3d 622, 624 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(internal quotations omitted). \nIn this case, defendants do not challenge UTCO's standing as a factual matter (i.e., \nwith documentation disputing UTCO's standing). We thus begin by setting forth the well-\npleaded allegations in the Complaint that bear on the matter ofUTCO's standing. \n1. \nPlaintiffs allege UTCO is  \"an unincorporated association, the members of which \ninclude individuals currently residing on the streets and other non-permanent locations, \nprimarily  using personally-owned tents  for  shelter,  and supportive  housed community \nmembers, primarily based in the Uptown neighborhood\" (Compl., ~ 6). UTCO's objective \nis  \"to raise awareness about the plight of homelessness across the city of Chicago, to \nprovide  services  for  homeless  individuals,  and to  advocate  for  those  who  have  been \nexcluded from mainstream society\" (Id.).4 \nBetween July and September 2016, some 20 to 30 homeless persons created a \"tent \ncity\"  on  Stewart Mall (Compl., ~ 17).  \"Many of the tents\" were orange-colored tents \nprovided by UTCO (!d., ~ 19). The tents provided homeless individuals with safe shelter \nand drew attention to the lack of affordable housing options in Uptown (!d., ~ 18). People \nput up signs near the tents \"educating people about police harassment and announcing \nupcoming protests and marches\" and sometimes handed out informational leaflets (!d., ~ \n19). \n4The Complaint alleges that UTCO's mission is to champion the cause of the homeless in various ways \n(Compl., ~ 6). The Complaint does not define the term \"homeless\". While the meaning of that term may appear self \nevident, we note that the Illinois Homeless Act, which plaintiffs assert as the basis for one of their claims, defines \n\"housing status\" as \"the status of having or not having a fixed or regular residence, including the status of living on \nthe streets, in a shelter, or in a temporary residence.\" 775 ILCS § 45/IO(b). \n6 \n\nIn late September 2016, Stewart Mall was fenced off and the homeless who were \nencamped  in  that  location  were  forced  to  move  (Compl.,  ,  20).  \"Many\"  of these \nindividuals set up tents under the LSD viaducts at Wilson and Lawrence Avenues (Id.,, \n21). \nIn March 2017, plaintiffs sought a permit to \"erect a tent city\" on Stewart Mall \nbecause construction was due to begin on the viaducts (Compl., ,  24).  Stewart Mall is \npublic land located across the street from  Chicago  City Alderman James Cappleman's \noffice  and \"highly visible\" to people on Broadway Avenue (Id.,  ,, 16-17). Plaintiffs' \npurpose in requesting the permit was \"two-fold: to provide an alternative location to live \nfor the homeless people living in tents under the Wilson and Lawrence viaducts; and to \nerect a tent city  in a highly visible location in order to protest the  lack of affordable \nhousing in the City of Chicago\" (Id.,, 24). \nOn  September  17,  2017,  with  construction  on  the  viaducts  due  to  begin  the \nfollowing  day,  homeless  individuals  living  in  tents  under  the  viaducts  -- numbering \nbetween 20 and 25  -- moved their tents and belongings to an area west of the Wilson \nviaduct with the help  of housed UTCO  members  (Compl., ,, 44-46).  \"Many\" of the \nhomeless individuals had posted signs outside their tents with messages, such as \"Homes \nNot Shelters\" or \"Stop Harassing the Homeless\" (Id., ,  55). The next morning, City of \nChicago police officers ordered that the individuals remove the tents or risk arrest and \nconfiscation of the property (Id ., ,, 48-49). Chicago police officers informed individuals \nthat unattended tents and possessions would be moved to 850 West Wilson (Id., ,, 53-54), \nwhich is about one-third of a mile from the Wilson A venue viaduct. That afternoon, \"the \ntent encampment moved\" a short distance away (ld.,, 56). \n7 \n\nOn the morning of September 19,  2017, Chicago Police officers again threatened \narrest and confiscation if the tent encampment did not move (Compl., ~ 58).  Chicago \npolice officers went tent-to-tent to inform people they would have to move, and to ask if \nthey needed medical attention (Id.,  ~ 61).  One Chicago police officer marked tents for \nremoval  with  blue  masking tape  after the  warnings  were  given  (Jd.).  Chicago police \nofficers stated that unattended items would be tagged: sanitation workers confiscated one \nunattended tent, and the remaining individuals moved the tents across the sidewalk to land \nowned by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (Id., ~~ 63, 65). An employee of \nthe Water Reclamation District told the individuals they had to leave, and that evening \nmost of the  people  -- with the  assistance  of housed UTCO  members  -- moved their \nbelongings to an \"abandoned\" private lot nearby (Id., ~~ 66-67). \nThe next day, a Chicago police commander informed the individuals remaining in \nthe tents that they were trespassing and would be subject to arrest if they did not move, or \nif they tried to set up a tent encampment elsewhere in Uptown (Compl., ~~ 70-74). Tyler \nDean Hamlin, an UTCO member (plaintiffs do not allege whether he is homeless), refused \nto  leave and was  arrested for trespass (Id.,  ~ 73).  In addition, plaintiffs allege that the \nChicago police commander stated that items left on the public way would be confiscated \n(Id., ~ 74). \n2. \nPlaintiffs contend that they have adequately alleged that UTCO has standing to sue \nm  its  own  right.  They  assert  that  UTCO  suffered  a  direct  injury  from  defendants' \nchallenged conduct because the City \"has seized and threatened to  seize the tents and \nother  materials  UTCO  provided,\"  which  directly  injured  UTCO  \"because it  needs  to \n8 \n\nfundraise to attempt to replace at least some of the confiscated property\" (Pls.' Resp. at 4). \nIn addition, plaintiffs contend that dispersal of the tent encampment made \"it much more \ndifficult, and in many instances impossible, for UTCO to perform its mission as it cannot \nreadily find the people it is  attempting to serve,\" and UTCO expended time and assets \nmoving homeless people who were displaced (!d.).  Defendants dispute that UTCO has \nadequately alleged \"that it, as an organization, has been harmed by any action of the City\" \n(Defs.'  Mem.  at  5).  For the following  reasons,  we find  that UTCO had not plausibly \nalleged that it suffered an injury in fact, and thus, UTCO does not have standing to sue in \nits own right. 5 \nAs explained above,  to have standing a plaintiff must allege that it suffered an \n\"injury in fact,\" meaning '\"an invasion of a legally protected interest' that is 'concrete and \nparticularized'  and  'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"' Matushkina, \n877 F.3d at 293 (quoting Spokeo,  136 S.Ct. at 1548). An \"injury is  concrete because it \n'actually exist[s],' and it is particularized because it 'affects [the plaintiff] in a personal \nand individual way.\" ld. For an organization to have standing to sue in its own right, the \norganization must allege that it -- rather than only its members -- suffered a concrete and \npatiicularized injury. Milw. Police Ass 'n v.' Flynn, 863 F.3d 636, 639 (7th Cir. 2017). \nHere, plaintiffs do not adequately allege that UTCO itself suffered an injury in fact. \nAlthough they plead that UTCO provided \"many\" of the tents used by the homeless in \nUptown (Compl., 'if  19), plaintiffs allege only that one unattended tent was confiscated, \n5We  note that defendants argue,  at the threshold,  that the alleged injuries UTCO identified should be \ndisregarded because they are improper \"attempts to amend its pleading with arguments in its response brief' (doc.# \n70: Defs.' Reply at 1). We decline to read the Complaint so narrowly. \"Rule 8(a)(3) requires the plaintiffto identify \nthe remedy sought, but it does not require detail about the nature of the plaintiffs injury.\" Dieffenbach v. Barnes & \nNoble, Inc., 887 F.3d 826, 828 (7th Cir. 2018). Thus, we address on the merits plaintiffs' claims of direct injury to \nUTCO. \n9 \n\nand the allegations do not tie UTCO to that tent in a concrete or particularized manner. \nPlaintiffs do not allege that UTCO provided the one confiscated tent, that the owners of \nthe  confiscated  property  were  members  of UTCO,  or  that  the  tent  was  confiscated \npermanently and could not later be reclaimed by the owner. Despite an allegation that one \nunidentified officer stated generally \"[i]f there is nobody here,  it's garbage,\" the Court \ncannot reasonably infer from the Complaint that the one confiscated tent was permanently \ndisposed  of,  because  plaintiffs  allege  that  the  removed  property  was  visibly  tagged. \nMoreover, UTCO's description of its alleged injury -- a \"need[] to fundraise to attempt to \nreplace  at  least  some  of the  confiscated property\"  (Pls.'  Resp.  at  4)  -- sounds  more \nspeculative and hypothetical than actual or imminent. For these reasons, plaintiffs have \nnot adequately plead that UTCO itself suffered a concrete and particularized injmy from \nthe alleged removal of one unattended tent and certain unspecified personal items. \nLikewise, UTCO's alleged need to expend additional time and assets moving and \nlocating  homeless  people  who  had  been  displaced  does  not  constitute  a  sufficiently \nconcrete  and  pmiicularized  injmy  to  UTCO.  \"[O]rdinary  expenditures  as  pmi  of an \norganization's  purpose  do  not  constitute  the  necessmy  injury-in-fact  required  for \nstanding.\" Plotkin v.  Ryan, 239 F.3d 882, 886 (7th Cir.  2001). In Plotkin, the Seventh \nCircuit held that while  the Better Government Association had \"been instrumental  in \nadvancing government reforms in Illinois by using investigators and attorneys along with \njournalistic techniques and litigation to expose corruption,\" it did not have \"standing as an \norganization, apati from  its members, simply by reason of its  expenditure of time and \nmoney  in  pursuing the  alleged  fraud.\"  !d.  The  Seventh  Circuit  explained that  \"good \nintentions are not enough for federal standing.\" !d. \n10 \n\nThe  reasonmg  m  Plotkin  is  applicable  here.  While  UTCO's  mission  to  help \nhomeless people in Chicago -- specifically in the Uptown neighborhood -- is laudable, any \nadditional efforts or expenditures it must make to find homeless people or help them move \nare \"ordinary expenditures as part of an organization's purpose.\" Plotkin, 239 F.3d at 886. \nMoreover, UTCO does not identify any particular individual it has had difficulty locating \nsince the tent encampment was dispersed. Where an organization asserts it has standing to \nsue on its  own behalf, \"[a]n abstract interest in a matter never has been considered a \nsufficient basis for the maintenance of-or the continuation of-litigation in the federal \ncourts.\" Muro v.  Target Corp., 580 F.3d 485, 491  (7th Cir. 2009). See also Flynn,  863 \nF.3d at 639 (\"an interest in the underlying law does  not equal an injury\" for standing \npurposes). Therefore, UTCO has not alleged the necessary injury-in-fact required for it to \nasseti standing to sue on its own behalf. \n3. \nPlaintiffs also asseti that UTCO has associational standing, or standing to sue in a \nrepresentative  capacity  on  behalf of its  members.  An  organization  has  associational \nstanding if \"(1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) \nthe interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (3) neither \nthe claim assetied nor the relief requested requires the patiicipation of individual members \nin the lawsuit.\" Flynn, 863  F.3d at 639. Plaintiffs contend that UTCO has associational \nstanding because \"[a]t least one ofUTCO's members suffered direct harm from the City's \npolicies and conduct (e.g., seizure of unidentified homeless UTCO members' belongings, \narrest  of UTCO  member,  general  displacement  of various  UTCO  homeless  members, \netc.)\" (Pls.' Resp. at 6). \n11 \n\na. \nUTCO has associational standing to assert the First Amendment claim in Count II of \nthe Complaint, because Mr. Thayer has standing to assert it. The Complaint alleges Mr. \nThayer is  a member of UTCO and shares the same goals  as  UTCO, so \"the first and \nsecond prongs of the associational standing test are easily met.\" Flynn, 863 F.3d at 640. In \naddition, the third requirement for associational standing \"is made simple where, as here, \nthe organization seeking standing is joined in suit with its members who have Article III \nstanding.\" !d. Thus, UTCO has associational standing to assert the claim in Count II. \nb. \nHowever, like Mr. Thayer, UTCO does not have associational standing to assert the \nclaims in Counts III through VI. \"In part because of the difficulty of verifYing the facts \nupon  which  such  probabilistic  standing  depends,  the  [Supreme]  Court  has  required \nplaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to identity members who have suffered the \nrequisite harm.\" Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009). It is not enough \nto  establish organizational standing with \"speculation\" of a \"statistical probability that \nsome of [its]  members are threatened with injury\"; rather, plaintiff organizations must \n\"make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or \nwould suffer harm.\" !d. at 497-99. \"Standing ... is not an ingenious academic exercise in \nthe conceivable but requires a factual showing of perceptible harm.\" !d. at 499 (internal \n· citations and quotations omitted). \nThe Seventh Circuit has not addressed the issue of associational standing where the \nplaintiffs do not identity any member of the plaintiff organization who allegedly suffered \n12 \n\nan injury in fact.6 However, other Courts of Appeals have held that where a complaint \nfails to identify a specific member who would be injured by the challenged government \naction,  the  plaintiff organization  lacks  standing to  sue  on behalf of its  members.  See \nGeorgia Republican Party v.  Sec.  &  Exch.  Comm'n,  888  F.3d  1198  (11th Cir.  2018); \nTenn.  Republican Party v.  Sec.  & Exch.  Comm 'n, 863 F.3d 507, 520-21 (6th Cir. 2017); \nOuachita Watch League v.  United States Forest Serv.,  858 F.3d 539,  542-43  (8th Cir. \n2017); Draper v.  Healey,  827 F.3d  1,  3 (1st Cir.  2016);  Swanson  Grp.  Mfg.,  LLC,  v. \nJewell, 790 F.3d 235, 244 (D.C. Cir. 2015); S.  Walk at Broadlands Homeowner's Ass'n, \nInc. v.  OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 184-85 (4th Cir. 2013).7 \nHere, the Complaint does not identify any specific member of UTCO that suffered \nor would suffer an injmy in  fact from the  claims in  Counts III through VI.  Only two \nUTCO  members  are  identified  by  name  in  the  Complaint:  UTCO's  co-plaintiff,  Mr. \nThayer, and Tyler Dean Hamlin. With regard to Mr. Thayer, plaintiffs have admitted that \nhe does not have standing to assert Counts III through VI (Pis.' Resp. at 2). Mr. Hamlin, \nfor his part, is only mentioned in paragraph 73 of the Complaint, which asserts that he is a \nmember ofUTCO and was arrested after refusing to heed an officer's waming that he was \ntrespassing  on  private  property  (Compl.,  ~ 73).  Plaintiffs  do  not  allege  whether  Mr. \nHamlin was housed or homeless, and like Mr.  Thayer,  if Mr.  Hamlin was housed, he \nwould not have standing to assert the claims in Counts III through VI of the Complaint. \n~evertheless, the Seventh Circuit has relied on Summers to hold that an environmental group did not \nhave associational standing where the interests alleged by its two identified members \"were too generalized\" \nto give rise to standing. See Pollack v. U.S. Dep 't Of Justice, 577 F.3d 736, 742-43 (7th Cir. 2009). \n7B  ut see Nat 'I Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, 800 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 20 15) (stating, in dicta, \nthat the court was \"not convinced that Summers ... stands for the proposition that an injured member of an \norganization  must  always  be  specifically  identified  in  order  to  establish  Article  III  standing  for  the \norganization.\"). \n13 \n\nMoreover, the Complaint fails to allege that UTCO members were among the homeless \nindividuals who were displaced when the Uptown tent community was dispersed. 8 \nIf any homeless UTCO member had suffered an injury in fact, we expect that by the \nsecond  amended  complaint  plaintiffs  would  have  identified  that  person.  Indeed,  as \ndefendants note (doc. # 70: Defs.' Reply at 4), two homeless individuals who had lived in \ntents under the Uptown viaducts (Carol Aldape and Thomas Gordon) are named plaintiffs \nin a pending lawsuit brought on behalf of themselves and a proposed class in the Circuit \nCourt of Cook County. See Aldape et al.  v.  City of Chicago, No. 2017 CH 12186.9  In \naddition, two other individuals who had lived in tents under the viaducts testified at the \npreliminary injunction hearing in this case: Joseph Munay, who testified that he was a \nmember of UTCO, and John Skulsky, who testified that he had attended several UTCO \nmeetings (doc.# 50: Tr. Prelim. Inj. Hearing at 52-53, 110-12). Plaintiffs' failure to plead \nthat \"at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm,\" Summers, 555 \nU.S. at 499, dooms their argument for associational standing to assert the claims in Counts \nIII through VI. \n4. \nFinally, plaintiffs attempt to demonstrate that UTCO can assert the claims in the \nComplaint under the  doctrine of \"third-party standing\" (Pls.'  Resp.  at 7-9).  However, \nthird-party standing is not an independent basis upon which UTCO can establish standing. \n8In fact, all of the allegations in the Complaint that refer to \"UTCO members\" distinguish \"homeless\" \npersons or residents from \"UTCO members\" (see Compl., ~~ 46, 52, 67-68, 71). Thus, we cannot plausibly \ninfer that the homeless people referred to in the Complaint were UTCO members. \n9Taking \"judicial notice of public court documents is appropriate when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss.\" Collins v.  Viti.  of Palatine, Illinois, 875 F.3d 839, 842 (7th Cir. 20 17). Likewise, judicial notice may be \ntaken when the Court rules on a Rule 12(b)(l) motion. See, e.g., Cause ofA  ction v. Chicago Transit Auth., 815 F.3d \n267,277 n.l3 (7th Cir. 2016). \n14 \n\nRather, the doctrine is a prudential presumption against recognizing standing. See Dunnet \nBay Canst. Co. v. Borggren, 799 F.3d 676, 695 (7th Cir. 2015). This presumption-- which \nis  that  a  litigant  \"cannot assert  the  legal  rights  or  interests  of third  patiies\"  -- is  an \nadditional  limitation  on  standing,  which  the  Comi  considers  only  if the  Article  III \nstanding requirements have been met.Id. at 695. Because neither plaintiffhas satisfied the \nconstitutional requirements  of standing for the claims in Counts  III through VI  of the \nComplaint, plaintiffs' attempt to assert third-party standing fails. \nEven  if plaintiffs  could  satisfy the  constitutional  requirements  for  standing,  the \nCourt would not apply an exception to the presumption against third-party standing here. \nIn deciding whether the presumption against third-party  standing  has  been overcome, \ncomis consider whether the litigant \"is fully, or vety nearly, as effective a proponent of \nthe right\" as the third party, and whether \"there is  some genuine obstacle\" to the third \nparty's ability to  asseti his  or her own right.  Singleton v.  Wulff,  428 U.S.  106,  114-16 \n(1976).  Here,  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  allege  a  \"genuine  obstacle\"  to  the  ability  of \nhomeless  people  to  asseti the  claims  in  Counts  III  through VI  that plaintiffs  seek to \nchampion. They cite to the Comi's observation that the homeless population is \"far from \nstatic,\" and note that \"a specific individual may be living in a tent one day, staying in a \nshelter another night, sleeping on someone's couch a third night, and back on the streets \nthe fomih night\" (Pls.' Resp. at 9, citing Defs.' Mem., Ex.  1 (09/15117 Tr.) at 6:14-15). \nFrom this, plaintiffs claim that \"[l]ocating one individual who would remain unhoused for \nthe  entire  course  of this  case  would  prove  difficult  at  best\"  (Pls.'  Resp.  at  9).  This \nargument misses the mark for three reasons. \n15 \n\nFirst,  the  Court's comment was  made  in the  context of the  fluid  nature  of the \nhomeless population living in tents under the viaducts, and was not a statement about the \nduration of an individual's homeless  status  (09/15/17 Tr.  at 6: 14-19). Second,  in each \nscenario  set  forth  in  plaintiffs'  memorandum,  the  individual  described  would  be \n\"homeless\" under the Illinois Homeless Act, which defines housing status as \"having or \nnot having a fixed or regular residence, including the status of living on the streets, in a \nshelter, or in a temporary residence.\" 775 ILCS 4511 O(b ). Third, the specter of a homeless \nperson losing that status during the pendency of a lawsuit he or she has brought has not \nbeen an impediment to other cases brought by specific homeless persons, including the \ncase pending in state court in Chicago and the cases plaintiffs cite that have been brought \nby homeless people in courts in other cities. See Lavan v.  City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d \n1022, 1023 (9th Cir. 2012); Jones v.  City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), \nvacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007); Pottinger v.  City of Miami, 810 F. Supp.  1551, \n1553 (S.D. Fla. 1992). \nIn sum, neither plaintiff in this case has standing to assert Counts III through VI of \nthe  Complaint.  Therefore,  the  Court  grants  defendants'  motion to  dismiss  Counts  III \nthrough VI of the Complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. \nThe  dismissal  of these  counts  is  without  prejudice.  \"A  suit  dismissed  for  lack  of \njurisdiction cannot also be dismissed with prejudice; that's a disposition on the merits, \nwhich only a court with jurisdiction may render.\" Collier v. SP Plus Corp., 889 F.3d. 894, \n897 (7th Cir. 20 18) (internal quotations and citations omitted). See also Lennon v.  City of \nCarmel, Indiana, 865 F.3d 503, 509 (7th Cir. 2017) (\"a dismissal with prejudice acts ... as a \ndisposition on the merits, which a court without the power to hear a case may not issue\"). \n16 \n\nII. \nWe next address whether the claims plaintiffs assert in Count II of the Complaint \ncan survive defendants' Rule 12(b )( 6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncan  be  granted.  In  Count  II,  plaintiffs  contend  that  defendants  violated  their  First \nAmendment rights to free speech and assembly through \"MCC § 10-8-334 and 10-28-010 \nas  applied  to  them\"  and  \"the  City's  disruption  and  eviction  of tent  cities  beginning \nSeptember 17, 2017 and continuing through the present day\" (Compl., ~~ 126-128).10 \nOn a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion, \"we construe the complaint in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, accepting as true all well-pleaded facts alleged, and drawing all possible \ninferences in the plaintiff's favor.\" Cannici v.  Vill.  of Melrose Park, 885 F.3d 476, 479 \n(7th Cir.  2018) (internal quotations  and citations omitted).  To survive a Rule  12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \"A claim has \nfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability \nrequirement,'  but it  asks  for  more than  a sheer possibility that a  defendant has  acted \nunlawfully.\" Id.  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). \n10lt is well-settled that the First Amendment's prohibition against government infringement on the \nfreedom of speech is applicable to States and municipal governments vested with state authority through the \nFourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Reedv. Town ofGilbert, Ariz.,_ U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 2218,2226 (2015). \n17 \n\nA. \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs fail to state a claim because plaintiffs' conduct - \nseeking to establish a tent city -- is not protected expression under the First Amendment \n(Defs.' Mem. at 6). It is plaintiffs' burden to show they engaged in speech or conduct that \nwas constitutionally protected. Consolino v.  Towne,  872 F.3d 825, 829 (7th Cir. 2017). \nWhether plaintiffs have met that burden is a question of law for the court to decide. See, \ne.g., Forgue v.  City ofChicago, 873 F.3d 962,966 (7th Cir. 2017). \nPlaintiffs allege that they had two purposes for seeking to create a tent city: ( 1) \"to \nprovide an alternative location to live for the homeless people living in tents under the \nWilson and Lawrence viaducts\"; and (2) \"to protest the lack of affordable housing in the \nCity  of  Chicago\"  (Compl.,  ,  24).  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  tents  constituted \n\"quintessential acts of speech\" because they \"had signs posted on them stating 'Homes \nNot Shelters,' 'Stop Harassing the Homeless,' and other similar messages\"' (Pls.' Resp. at \n12).  In addition, plaintiffs argue that \"the tents were, in themselves, symbolic speech\" \nbecause  they  used  \"the  physical  act  of occupying  space\"  to  \"spread  [their]  political \nmessage\" (!d.), and they would be \"highly visible\" on Stewart Mall (Compl., ,, 16-17). \nTo determine whether pmiicular conduct is sufficiently expressive to implicate the \nFirst Amendment, we consider whether \"[a]n intent to convey a pmiicularized message \nwas present,\" and additionally, whether \"the likelihood was great that the message would \nbe understood by those who viewed it.\" Spence v.  Washington,  418 U.S.  405, 410-11 \n(1974). Plaintiffs allege that one of their two goals in erecting a tent city was to convey a \nmessage \"to protest the lack of affordable housing in the City of Chicago\" (Compl.,, 24) \nand \"to express a message to the rest of the city that there are people who need help\" \n18 \n\n(Pls.' Resp. at 14 ). Construing the Complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we \nfind that they have adequately alleged an intent to convey a patiicularized message. \nHowever,  the  intent  behind  plaintiffs'  conduct  is  not  enough  to  warrant  First \nAmendment protection. There must also be a \"great\" likelihood that \"the message would \nbe understood by those who viewed it.\" Spence, 418 U.S. at 410-11. The Supreme Court \nhas  \"rejected  the  view  that  'conduct  can  be  labeled  'speech'  whenever  the  person \nengaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\"' Rumsfeld v. Forum for A cad. \n& Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 65-66 (2006) (quoting United States v.  O'Brien, \n391  U.S.  367, 376 (1968)). Instead, the Supreme Comi has extended First Amendment \nprotection only to conduct that is \"inherently expressive.\" Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 66. For \nexample, in Texas v.  Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405-06 (1989), the Supreme Court held that \nthe \"expressive, overtly political nature\"  of burning an American flag  -- whose \"very \npurpose  .  .  .  is  to  serve  as  a  symbol  of  our  country\"  -- was  \"intentional  and \noverwhelmingly apparent\" with the Republic National Convention being held nearby. \nBy  contrast,  in  Rumsfeld, the  Supreme  Court held that  law schools'  conduct  m \ndenying  equal  access  to  military recruiters  on  campus  was  not  inherently  expressive, \nbecause the conduct was \"expressive only because the  law schools  accompanied their \nconduct with speech explaining it.\" Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 66. Otherwise, \"[a]n observer \nwho  sees  military  recruiters  interviewing  away  from  the  law  school  has  no  way  of \nknowing whether the law school is expressing its disapproval of the military, all the law \nschool's interview rooms are full,  or the military recruiters decided for reasons of their \nown that they would rather interview someplace else.\" Id.  The Supreme Court held that \n\"[t]he fact that such explanatory speech is necessary is strong evidence that the conduct at \n19 \n\nissue here is not so inherently expressive that it warrants protection under 0 'Brien.\" !d. \nThe  Seventh Circuit recently  held that for  conduct to  be considered \"inherently \nexpressive,\" it \"must comprehensively communicate its own message without additional \nspeech.\" Tagami v.  City of Chicago, 875 F.3d 375, 378 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing Rumsfeld, \n547 U.S. at 66). \"Put slightly differently, the conduct itself must convey a message that \ncan be readily 'understood by those who view[]  it.\"' Tagami,  875 F.3d at 378 (quoting \nJohnson, 491  U.S. at 404 and Spence, 418 U.S. at 411). In Tagami, the Seventh Circuit \nheld  that  the  plaintiffs  conduct  -- appearing  topless  in  public  -- was  not  inherently \nexpressive  conduct  entitled  to  First Amendment  protection  because  it \"did  not  itself \ncommunicate  a message  of political protest\" where  the  plaintiff alleged that  she  also \nvoiced her \"views that women, like men, should not be prohibited from appearing bare \nchested in public.\" Tagami, 875 F.3d at 378. \nIn this case, the conduct for which plaintiffs seek First Amendment protection is \nmore analogous to the conduct that was at issue in Rumsfeld and Tagami than the flag \nburning in Johnson.  Like the complaint in Tagami, the Complaint here alleges that the \nexpressive component of the tents was communicated by the signs attached to the tents \nand other written messages (Compl., ~~ 19, 55). Indeed, plaintiffs double-down on this \nallegation in their brief, arguing that their conduct meets the second prong of the test set \nfmih in Spence -- that there was a great likelihood their message would be understood by \nthose who viewed it -- because \"[p]asser-bys encountered the message and were handed \nleaflets\"  (Pls.'  Resp.  at  14).  Like  in  Tagami  and  Rumsfeld,  the  need  for  additional \nexplanatory speech is  \"strong evidence\" that erecting the tents was \"not so  inherently \nexpressive  that  it  warrants  [First  Amendment]  protection.\"  Tagami,  875  F.3d  at  378 \n20 \n\n(quoting Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 66). \nMoreover, plaintiffs here have admitted that one of their two purposes for creating a \ntent city was non-expressive: to provide shelter for homeless people. The Complaint does \nnot \"offer any facts from which it might reasonably be inferred that onlookers would have \nreadily  understood\"  that  in  addition  to  providing  homeless  people  with  shelter,  the \nplacement of tents (without more) was meant to express a political statement. Tagami, 875 \nF.3d at 378.  For this reason, we find unpersuasive plaintiffs'  attempt to  compare their \nconduct to sit-ins during the Civil Rights movement, and to overnight encampments that \ntook  place  on  public  lands  during the  \"Occupy movement\"  (Pls.'  Resp.  at  13).  The \nOccupy movement and sit-ins during the Civil Rights movement, unlike the instant case, \nhad a singularly expressive purpose to protest government policies. See, e.g., Dukore v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 799 F.3d 1137, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Thus, plaintiffs have failed to \nshow  that  erecting  a  tent  city  is  \"so  inherently  expressive  that  it  warrants  First \nAmendment protection.\" Tagami, 875 F.3d at 378. \nB. \nFurthermore, even if plaintiffs had adequately alleged that their attempt to establish \na  tent  city  constitutes  protected  First  Amendment  expression,  plaintiffs  have  not \nadequately alleged that MCC § 10-8-334 and § 10-28-010 violated the First Amendment \nas  applied  to  them  (Compl.,  ~ 126).11  MCC  §  10-8-334,  the  provision  under  which \nplaintiffs sought permission to erect a tent city, sets forth the requirements for having a \n\"public  assembly\"  in the  City  of Chicago,  which the  code  defines  as  \"a company of \npersons  collected  together  in  one  place  on  the  sidewalk,  or  any  organized  march  or \n11Piaintiffs do not assert that the ordinances on their face discriminate according to the content of speech. \n21 \n\nprocession of persons upon the sidewalk, which is reasonably anticipated to interfere with \nor impede the flow of pedestrian traffic ...\"  MCC § 10-8-334. Section 10-28-010 is the \nsection of the municipal code which sets forth the requirements to erect \"structures\" on \nand under \"public ways\" in the City. MCC § 10-28-010. Plaintiffs were denied a public \nassembly permit to erect a tent city on the ground that a  public way use permit was \nrequired (04/14/2017 Admin. Decis. at 6, 8). \n\"An as-applied challenge is one that charges an act is unconstitutional as applied to \na  plaintiffs specific  activities  even though  it  may be capable  of valid  application to \nothers.\" Surita v.  Hyde, 665 F.3d 860, 875 (7th Cir. 2011). Here, plaintiffs contend that \nthe City applied MCC § 10-8-334 to them in a way that violated their First Amendment \nrights, because the City has granted public assembly permits to other applicants for \"the \nerection of non-permanent structures as part of the assemblies that are dismantled at the \nend of the assembly,\" such as scaffolding and elevated stages for speakers (Compl., ~ 36). \nIn addition, plaintiffs contend that as applied to them, MCC § 10-28-010, et seq., violated \ntheir First Amendment rights, because to obtain a public way use permit, they would have \nto obtain approval from the 46th Ward aldetman, which plaintiffs maintain they would not \nreceive (!d.,~~ 37-38). \nWhile  the  First  Amendment  indeed  prohibits  viewpoint  discrimination  through \nselective enforcement of an otherwise facially neutral law, plaintiffs' allegations are too \nspeculative  to  support  a  plausible  claim  that  the  City  applied  the  ordinances  in  a \ndiscriminatory  manner  to  plaintiffs.  \"Granting waivers  to  favored  speakers  (or,  more \nprecisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but . \n. . this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears ...\"  \n22 \n\nThomas  v.  Chicago Park Dist.,  534 U.S.  316, 325  (2002) (holding that Chicago Park \nDistrict ordinance requiring a person to obtain a permit in order to conduct a public event \ninvolving more than 50 people was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to group \nseeking  to  hold  rallies  advocating  the  legalization  of marijuana).  \"[W]hen  someone \nchallenges a law as viewpoint discriminatory but it is not clear from the face of the law \nwhich speakers  will  be allowed to  speak,  he  must  show that he was  prevented from \nspeaking while someone espousing another viewpoint was permitted to do so.\" McCullen \nv.  Coakley,_ U.S._, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2534 n.4 (2014). \nA  recent Eighth Circuit opinion summarized the relevant rule well: \"To sustain an \nas-applied challenge based on viewpoint discrimination, [the plaintiff]  must establish a \n'pattern of unlawful favoritism' by showing that she 'was prevented from speaking while \nsomeone espousing another viewpoint was permitted to do so.'\" Phelps-Roper v. Ricketts, \n867 F.3d 883, 897 (8th Cir. 2017) (quoting Thomas, 534 U.S. at 325 and McCullen,  134 \nS.  Ct. at 2534). See also Brown v.  City of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d 263, 294 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(holding that \"[i]n order to establish municipal liability for  selective enforcement of a \nfacially  viewpoint- and  content-neutral  regulation,  a  plaintiff whose  evidence  consists \nsolely of the incidents of enforcement themselves must establish a pattern of enforcement \nactivity evincing a governmental policy or custom of intentional discrimination on the \nbasis of viewpoint or content\"). \nIn this case, plaintiffs offer only a conclusmy allegation that the City has granted \npublic assembly permits to other applicants for \"the erection of non-permanent structures \nas part of the assemblies that are dismantled at the end of the assembly\" (Compl., ~ 36). \nPlaintiffs do not allege that the City ever issued a public assembly permit that allowed \n23 \n\ntents or other non-permanent structures to be erected -- and in which people would live - \nfor a seven months-long period, as opposed to a permit allowing non-permanent structures \nto be erected for concerts, festivals or other activities lasting for no more than a few days. \nThus, plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that the City applied its regulations based \non  viewpoint  discrimination  as  opposed  to  any  number  of  non-discriminatory \nconsiderations, such as the public health and safety. See Thomas, 534 U.S. at 323. \nc. \nWe dismiss Count II with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted. \"Despite th[ e] generally liberal approach to pleading amendments, ... district \ncomis have broad discretion to deny leave to amend where there is undue delay, bad faith, \ndilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the defendants, or \nwhere the amendment would be futile.\" Mulvania v.  Sheriff of Rock Island County, 850 \nF.3d  849,  855  (7th  Cir.  2017).  In  this  case,  plaintiffs  have  already  amended  their \ncomplaint twice, and they have failed to cure deficiencies in their First Amendment claim. \nIn addition, in the latest Complaint, they have effectively plead themselves out of court on \ntheir First Amendment claim, because they allege that their conduct had a non-expressive \npurpose,  and  that  the  expressive  nature  of their  conduct  would  be  evident  through \nadditional speech. \nMoreover, plaintiffs did not seek leave to amend their complaint in their response to \nthe motion to dismiss (Pls.' Resp. at 35), and they have not given \"any indication to the \ncourt  how  they  might\"  cure  any  infirmities  in  the  allegations  of Count  II  of their \ncomplaint.  Haywood v.  Massage Envy Franchising,  LLC, 887 F.3d 329, 335  (7th Cir. \n20 18). In Haywood, the Seventh Circuit noted that in opposing the motion to dismiss, the \n24 \n\nplaintiff did not request leave to amend the complaint or \"suggest to the court the ways in \nwhich it might cure the defects\" in its pleading. Id. The Seventh Circuit held that \"courts \nare within their discretion to dismiss with prejudice where a party does not make such a \nrequest  or  showing.\" Id.  We exercise that discretion here,  and  dismiss  Count II with \nprejudice. \nIII. \nAll that remains of the Complaint is plaintiffs' state law claim in Count I. \"When a \ndistrict court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal claims, it cannot exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over any state claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367,\" because a court must \nhave original jurisdiction in order to  exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Mains v.  Citibank, \nNA., 852 F.3d 669, 679 (7th Cir. 2017). However, \"supplemental jurisdiction is possible\" to \nthe extent a court has original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the complaint. Id . \nIn Mains, the Seventh Circuit held that under Section 1367, \"the district court properly \ncould relinquish its [supplemental] jurisdiction over the state claims\" in the complaint, where \nthe district court properly dismissed some federal claims on the merits and others for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Mains, 852 F.3d at 679. By contrast, in Collier, the district court \nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the single federal law claim in a case that had been \nremoved from state court. Collier, 889 F.3d at 895-96. In those circumstances, the Seventh \nCircuit held that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) --which mandates that a case shall be remanded where \nit appears that the district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction -- required that the case be \nremanded to state court. Collier, 889 F.3d at 896-97. \nUnlike the case in Collier, we are not faced with a complaint over which we lack \nany subject-matter jurisdiction. Rather,  like the  case in Mains,  we have subject-matter \n25 \n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim for violation of the First Amendment in Count II, and \nwe  have  dismissed  that  Count  on  the  merits.  Because  the  Court  has  subject-matter \njurisdiction over the claim in Count II, we have supplemental jurisdiction over the state \nlaw claims in Count I if the claims in Counts I and II \"are so related . . . that they form \npart of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\" \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \nAs neither the statute nor Article III defines \"case or controversy,\" the Court asks \n\"whether the claims share a common nucleus of operative facts.\" See Prolite Bldg. Supply, \nLLC v. MW Mfrs., Inc.,_ F.3d _, 2018 WL 2316001, at *2 (7th Cir. May 22, 2018). We \nfind that they do. In Count I, plaintiffs allege the City improperly denied their application \nfor  a public assembly permit under MCC §  10-8-334 and erroneously determined that \nplaintiffs needed to obtain a public use permit under MCC § 10-28-010 (Compl., ~~ 34-\n36, 80-82). In Count II, plaintiffs plead that the City applied MCC §§ 10-8-334 and 10-28-\n010 to them in a manner that violated the First Amendment (!d.,~ 126). These claims rely \nupon \"a common nucleus of operative facts\": the actions plaintiffs allege the City took in \napplying the municipal regulations to plaintiffs' request for permission to erect a tent city. \nBecause the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the claim in Count I, Section \n1367(c)(3),  rather than  Section  1447(c),  provides  the  proper  course  of action for  the \ndisposition of Count I. Section 13 67 ( c )(3) provides that the district court may decline to \nexercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  a  claim  (for  which  it  has  supplemental \njurisdiction)  if \"the district  court has  dismissed  all  claims  over which  it has  original \njurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). As there are no remaining federal law claims in the \ncase, we decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in Count I, \n26 \n\npursuant to Section 1367(c)(3). We therefore dismiss Count I not on the merits, but in the \nexercise of our discretion to decline to retain supplemental jurisdiction over a local law \nclaim that can be addressed in state court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing  reasons,  the  Court (1)  grants  with prejudice defendants'  motion to \ndismiss  Count  II  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief can  be  granted  under  Rule \n12(b)(6); (2) grants without prejudice defendants' motion to dismiss Counts III, IV, V and VI for \nlack  of subject-matter jurisdiction  under  Rule  12(b)(l);  and  (3)  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § \n1367 (c  )(3 ), relinquishes jurisdiction over Count I. \nENTER: \n~QHE~ \n-\nUnited States Magistrate Judge \nDATE: June 5, 2018 \n27 ",

Schenkier, \nCITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF \nPresiding Magistrate Judge \nADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS, CITY \n \nOF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF \nTRANSPORTATION, and CITY OF \nCHICAGO, \n \n        Defendants. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ RULE 12(b)(1) AND 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTS II-VI OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \nDefendants City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings, the City of Chicago \nDepartment of Transportation, and the City of Chicago (collectively “Defendants” or the “City”), \nby their attorney, Edward N. Siskel, Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago, hereby move \nthis Court pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss Counts \nII-VI of the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Uptown Tent City Organizers and \nAndy Thayer (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).1  In support of their motion, the Defendants state as \nfollows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ lawsuit stems from ongoing construction of the Wilson and Lawrence \nAvenue viaducts under Lake Shore Drive and the City’s denial of a notification of public \nassembly for an area known as Stewart Mall.  Because the construction plans would displace \n                                                 \n1 This Rule 12 motion does not address Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, which seeks \nadministrative review of a decision by the Department of Administrative Hearings.  In accordance with \napplicable Illinois administrative review law, Defendants have previously answered that count by filing \nthe administrative record, and Defendants’ substantive response to the count consists of a separate \nresponse to the specification of errors contained in the count.  See ECF No. 54. \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:1048\nhomeless individuals who were staying at the viaducts, Plaintiffs sought the City’s approval to \nhold a public assembly at Stewart Mall for a period of nearly seven months – 24 hours a day – to \ninclude erecting tents where homeless individuals would reside.  Because Plaintiffs did not have \na required permit to erect structures on the public way, that portion of their assembly notification \nwas denied.  However, Plaintiffs were granted the right to assemble at Stewart Mall for the entire \ntime period they requested, just without the ability to erect tents. \n2.  After the City removed Plaintiffs’ administrative review claim to federal court, \nPlaintiffs filed a first amended complaint re-asserting their administrative review claim, and \nadding new claims under the First and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and a state \nlaw claim under the Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act.   \n3.  After being denied a preliminary injunction on their first amended complaint, on \nNovember 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, repleading each of the four \nclaims asserted in their first amended complaint, as well as adding new federal constitutional \nclaims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, relating to alleged actions taken by Defendants \nin the days following the commencement of construction. \n4.  To establish subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), a plaintiff has the \nburden to show that they have standing under Article III’s case or controversy requirement; it is \n“‘not a mere pleading requirement but rather an indispensable part of plaintiffs’ case[.]’”  Apex \nDigital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 572 F.3d 440, 443(7th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  Article III standing requires (1) an injury-in-\nfact to a legally protected interest, (2) a causal nexus whereby the injury is fairly traceable to \ndefendant’s actions, and (3) redressability of the injury by court action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-\n61.  An organization has standing to sue on behalf of others only when: (a) its members would \n2 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:1049\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires \nthe participation of the individual members of the lawsuit.  Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. \nCom’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  It is a plaintiff’s burden to establish standing.  Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561. \n5.  To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A complaint must contain more than “‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n555).  The defendant must be given “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Although well-pleaded factual allegations are presumed \ntrue for purposes of a motion to dismiss, legal conclusions and conclusory allegations that \nmerely recite the elements of a claim are not entitled to a presumption of truth.  Munson v. \nGaetz, 673 F.3d 630, 632 (7th Cir. 2012).  “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked \nassertions’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 557). \n6.  At the outset, Counts II-VI of the Second Amended Complaint should be \ndismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because Plaintiffs lack standing.  Plaintiff Thayer lacks \nstanding to assert Counts III-VI because (a) he has testified in this case that he is not homeless \nand (b) he has not alleged that any of his property was seized, searched or taken by Defendants.  \nPlaintiff UTCO lacks standing to assert Counts II-VI because it has failed to allege that it has \n3 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:1050\norganizational standing under Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Com’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 \n(1977).  But even if Plaintiffs had standing, their claims still fail on the merits. \n7.  Count II, which asserts a First Amendment violation, fails for several reasons.  \nFirst, erecting tents is not protected expression under the First Amendment.  But even if it was \nprotected expression, the City’s rejection of the request to erect tents, while providing Plaintiffs \nwith the right to assemble in the same place and time as they requested, is a reasonable time, \nplace and manner restriction.  The same holds true to the extent that individuals attempted to \nerect new tent encampments on the public way nearby the viaducts following the closure of the \nviaducts.  And the City, which is the only properly-named defendant on this count, cannot be \nheld liable for the decisions of its employees that prevented those tent encampments because \nPlaintiffs do not allege that such decisions resulted from a City policy, as required by Monell v. \nDept. of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658(1978).   \n8.  Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim (Count III) fails on its merits because no \naction by the Defendants has criminalized homelessness, and therefore no cruel or unusual \npunishment has been inflicted by Defendants.  Further, as to any decisions by City employees \nthat prevented new tent encampments nearby the viaducts, the City is not liable because \nPlaintiffs do not allege that such decisions resulted from a City policy, as required by Monell. \n9.  Count IV of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint purports to assert Fourth \nAmendment violations based on the alleged seizure of certain property by City employees in the \ndays following the commencement of construction.  This claim fails because Plaintiffs do not \nassert that their property was searched or seized, and they cannot vicariously assert Fourth \nAmendment claims on behalf of others.  Further, Plaintiffs have not established that any actions \n4 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:1051\nwere taken pursuant to a City policy, as required by Monell.  Moreover, to the extent that any \nproperty was seized, such seizure was reasonable, and therefore no warrant was required.  \n10.  Plaintiffs’ takings claim in Count V also the alleged seizure of certain property by \nCity employees in the days following the commencement of construction.  This claim fails \nbecause neither Plaintiff has claimed that their property was taken.  Further, Plaintiffs have not \nestablished that any actions were taken pursuant to a City policy, as required by Monell.  Further, \neven if Plaintiffs could overcome these hurdles, this claim should still be dismissed because it is \nnot ripe.  Plaintiffs have not made the required showing that a property owner has been denied \ncompensation for any property taken.  See Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. \nHamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 194-95 (1985). \n11.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ state law claim under the Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act \nin Count VI fails because they have not shown that homeless individuals were treated any \ndifferently than a non-homeless person , that any right to privacy under the Act was violated, or \nthat any adverse action was taken solely because people were homeless. \n12.  For the foregoing reasons, set forth more fully in Defendants’ accompanying \nMemorandum in Support, which is incorporated as if set forth fully herein, Counts II-VI of \nPlaintiffs’ Seconded Amended Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6) with prejudice. \n \n \n \n5 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:1052\nWHEREFORE, the Defendants respectfully request that this Court dismiss Counts II-VI \nof Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint and grant the Defendants such further relief as the \nCourt deems just and appropriate. \n \nDate:   January 19, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  EDWARD N.

Siskel, Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago, hereby move \nthis Court pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss Counts \nII-VI of the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Uptown Tent City Organizers and \nAndy Thayer (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).1  In support of their motion, the Defendants state as \nfollows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ lawsuit stems from ongoing construction of the Wilson and Lawrence \nAvenue viaducts under Lake Shore Drive and the City’s denial of a notification of public \nassembly for an area known as Stewart Mall.  Because the construction plans would displace \n                                                 \n1 This Rule 12 motion does not address Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, which seeks \nadministrative review of a decision by the Department of Administrative Hearings.  In accordance with \napplicable Illinois administrative review law, Defendants have previously answered that count by filing \nthe administrative record, and Defendants’ substantive response to the count consists of a separate \nresponse to the specification of errors contained in the count.  See ECF No. 54. \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:1048\nhomeless individuals who were staying at the viaducts, Plaintiffs sought the City’s approval to \nhold a public assembly at Stewart Mall for a period of nearly seven months – 24 hours a day – to \ninclude erecting tents where homeless individuals would reside.  Because Plaintiffs did not have \na required permit to erect structures on the public way, that portion of their assembly notification \nwas denied.  However, Plaintiffs were granted the right to assemble at Stewart Mall for the entire \ntime period they requested, just without the ability to erect tents. \n2.  After the City removed Plaintiffs’ administrative review claim to federal court, \nPlaintiffs filed a first amended complaint re-asserting their administrative review claim, and \nadding new claims under the First and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and a state \nlaw claim under the Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act.   \n3.  After being denied a preliminary injunction on their first amended complaint, on \nNovember 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, repleading each of the four \nclaims asserted in their first amended complaint, as well as adding new federal constitutional \nclaims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, relating to alleged actions taken by Defendants \nin the days following the commencement of construction. \n4.  To establish subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), a plaintiff has the \nburden to show that they have standing under Article III’s case or controversy requirement; it is \n“‘not a mere pleading requirement but rather an indispensable part of plaintiffs’ case[.]’”  Apex \nDigital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 572 F.3d 440, 443(7th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  Article III standing requires (1) an injury-in-\nfact to a legally protected interest, (2) a causal nexus whereby the injury is fairly traceable to \ndefendant’s actions, and (3) redressability of the injury by court action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-\n61.  An organization has standing to sue on behalf of others only when: (a) its members would \n2 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:1049\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires \nthe participation of the individual members of the lawsuit.  Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. \nCom’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  It is a plaintiff’s burden to establish standing.  Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561. \n5.  To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A complaint must contain more than “‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n555).  The defendant must be given “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Although well-pleaded factual allegations are presumed \ntrue for purposes of a motion to dismiss, legal conclusions and conclusory allegations that \nmerely recite the elements of a claim are not entitled to a presumption of truth.  Munson v. \nGaetz, 673 F.3d 630, 632 (7th Cir. 2012).  “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked \nassertions’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 557). \n6.

Plaintiff Thayer lacks \nstanding to assert Counts III-VI because (a) he has testified in this case that he is not homeless \nand (b) he has not alleged that any of his property was seized, searched or taken by Defendants.  \nPlaintiff UTCO lacks standing to assert Counts II-VI because it has failed to allege that it has \n3 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:1050\norganizational standing under Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Com’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 \n(1977).  But even if Plaintiffs had standing, their claims still fail on the merits. \n7.

Siskel, and Senior Counsel, \nKelley A. Gandurski, hereby remove this action from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, \nFirst Municipal District to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, \nEastern Division. \nRemoval is based upon federal question jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' Complaint for \nAdministrative Review (\"Complaint\") seeks review of claims arising under the U.S. \nConstitution.  In support of this Notice, the City states as follows: \nI.  Background \n1.  The Complaint was originally filed by Plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of Cook County, \nIllinois, First District, on May 17, 2017.  In the Complaint, the Plaintiffs allege that a final \nadministrative decision rendered on April 14, 2017, by the City of Chicago Department of \nAdministrative Hearings affects the rights of Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs desire a judicial review of \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 2 of 19 PageID #:2\nthat decision. Plaintiffs attach and incorporate a copy of the April 14, 2017 City of Chicago \nDepartment of Administrative Hearings decision to the Complaint as \"Exhibit 1.\" 1  Contained \nwithin the April14, 2017 Department of Administrative Hearings' decision is a \"Summary ofthe \nArguments.\"  In the final administrative order, the Administrative Law Judge held that: \n\"The Appellant sets forth various Constitutional arguments under the first (sic) \nand eighth (sic) Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as under Article 1 \nsection 5 of the Illinois Constitution and the Illinois Homeless Bill of Rights. \nThis body does not have jurisdiction to decide Constitutional issues and therefore \nthe Constitutional arguments were permitted to allow the parties to make and \npreserve the record for possible appeal.\" \nIn accordance with 28 U.S.C. §1446(a), a copy of all process, pleadings and orders received by \nthe City are attached hereto and incorporated herewith as Exhibit A. \n2.  The Complaint seeks judicial review of the April 14, 2017 final determination, which \ninvolved an appeal of a Notification ofPublic Assembly denial by CDOT2 At the request of \n• \nPetitioner Andy Thayer, a hearing was held on April 12, 2017, at the City of Chicago \nDepartment of Administrative Hearings, whereby Petitioner Andy Thayer presented testimony \nand evidence as to why CDOT's denial should be overturned.  The City also presented testimony \nand evidence as to the validity of the denial. \n3.  At the hearing, Petitioner alleged that the City denied the Notification of Public \nAssembly in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in that the denial violated \nhis right to free speech and assembly.  Additionally, Petitioner alleged that the City does not \nprovide alternative means of shelter for the City of Chicago's homeless population, thus \n1 Because the final administrative order is incorporated into Plaintiffs' Complaint, it is part of the pleading, and the \nfacts stated in the final administrative order are considered the same as having been alleged in the Complaint.  See \nFRCP 10 (c ), \"(c) ADOPTION BY REFERENCE; EXHIBITS. A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference \nelsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit \nto a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\"  See also, Ford v. University ofI llinois Board of Trustees, \n55 Il.App.3d 744, 747 (1st Dist. 1977) (\"Exhibits attached to the complaint become part ofthe pleadings ... and facts \nstated in such exhibits are considered the same as having been alleged in the complaint...factual matters in such \nexhibits which conflict with the allegations of a complaint negate such allegations.\"). \n2 The Municipal Code of Chicago § 10-8-334 governs Public Assemblies. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 3 of 19 PageID #:3\nsubjecting the homeless to Eighth Amendment violations prohibiting cruel and unusual \npunishment.  These issues were preserved in the final administrative order, which is attached to \nthe Complaint. \nII.  This Notice of Removal is Timely Filed \n4.  This lawsuit is a civil action within the meaning of the Acts of Congress relating to \nremoval of causes. \n5.  The City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings received a copy ofthe \ninitial pleading captioned \"Complaint for Illinois Administrative Review\" via certified mail on \nMay 23, 2017.  The City of Chicago Department of Transportation received a copy of the initial \npleading on May 23,2017. \n6.  The removal ofthis action to this Court is timely under 28 U.S.C. §1446(b) because this \nNotice of Removal is filed within thirty (30) days after May 23, 2017, which is the date \nDefendants first received the summons and complaint in this action. \n7.  The United States District Court for the N orthem District of Illinois, Eastern Division is \nthe proper place to file this Notice ofRemoval under 28 U.S.C. §1441(a) because it is the federal \ndistrict court that embraces the place where such action is pending. \nIII.  This Court has Federal Question Jurisdiction \n8.  Plaintiffs have requested a review of the administrative decision affirming the denial of \nthe Notification of Public Assembly and have raised First and Eighth Amendment U.S. \nConstitutional violations at the original hearing.  Those matters are preserved for review pursuant \nto the April 14, 2017 final administrative order.  Plaintiffs incorporated the final administrative \norder as part of their Complaint, which summarizes the U.S. Constitutional issues raised by \nPlaintiffs.  Because both state and federal courts have adopted the rule that exhibits attached to \n3 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 4 of 19 PageID #:4\nthe complaint become part of the pleadings, these U.S. Constitutional issues are now raised as \nallegations by Petitioner as if they were specifically set forth in the Complaint. \nAny review of the final administrative order will require a review of those U.S. Constitutional \narguments raised by Plaintiffs.  Therefore, federal question jurisdiction exists over Plaintiffs' \nclaims under 28 U.S.C. §1331 because the resolution ofthose claims will require adjudication of \nthose disputed questions involving the U.S. Constitution. \n9.  To the extent that the Complaint alleges statutory, state, municipal, common law or other \nnon-federal claims, this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over any such claims under 28 \nU.S.C. §1367 because those claims arise out of the same operative facts as Plaintiffs' U.S. \nConstitutional claims and \"form part ofthe same case or controversy under Article III of the \nUnited States Constitution.\"  28 U.S.C. §1367(a). \n10.  Because Plaintiffs' First and Eighth Amendment claims are raised, removal of this entire \ncause of action is therefore appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)(c). \nIV.  Consent of Defendants \n11.  All named Defendants to this action are actually one Defendant, the City of Chicago, a \nmunicipal corporation.  Ferguson v. Patton, 2013 IL 112488 (2013) (holding that City \ndepartments are organizational divisions of the City and do not enjoy independent legal status). \nTo that end, consent of other defendants is not applicable. \n' \nV.  Notice of Removal to the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, First District \n12.  Concurrently with this Notice of Removal, the City will file a copy of this Notice with \nthe Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, First District.  A copy of the written \nnotice of the Notice of Removal to Federal Court is attached hereto and incorporated herewith as \n4 \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 5 of 19 PageID #:5\nExhibit B.  In accordance with 28 U.S.C. §1446(d), the City will give written notice to Plaintiffs \nby contemporaneously serving this Notice of Removal on Plaintiffs. \n·13.  If an:y questions arise as to the propriety of this removal action, the City respectfully \nrequests the opportunity to present a brief and oral argument in support of its position that this \ncase is removable.  See Sierminski v.  Transouth Fin. Corp., 216 F.3d 945, 949 (11th Cir. 2000) \n(citing general rule that post-removal evidence in assessing removal jurisdiction may be \nconsidered by the Court and a district court may elicit or review evidence outside of the removal \npetition.) See also Harmon v. OKI Sys. 115 F.3d 477 (7th Cir. 1997) (where district court relied \nupon post-removal answers to interrogatories to determine whether removal jurisdiction was \nproper). \nVI.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that this civil action be, and is \nhereby, removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern \nDivision, that this Court assume jurisdiction of this civil action, and that this Court enter such \nother and further orders as may be necessary to accomplish the requested removal and promote \nthe ends ofjustice. \nJune 7, 2017 \nIs/  Kelley A.

Public Assembly Orgflnizer  ) \n) \nFINDINGS DECESJON AND OJU)ER \nThis matter comes before this Administrative Law Judge on the Public Assembly Organizer's \nappeal from the denial or a Notification of Public Assembly submitted on behalf of the Tent City \nAlternative to LSD Viaducts (hcreinaHcr \"Appellant\"). \nBACKGROUND \nOn March 30, 2017, at 2:55p.m., a Notification of Public Assembly was submitted by Appellant. \nAppellant's proposed Assembly \\.vas to commence on Friday, April 14, 2017, at l 0:00a.m. and \nend on Wednesday November 22, 2017 at 12:00 noon. The location of the Assembly is \ndescribed as the \"Pedestrhm Mall bel\\·VCen N. Kenmore AvchtJe at N. Brdad\\.., .. ay Avcmie·and N. \nKenmore Street \\1\\'here the pavement begins Y~ block south of W. Wilson Avenuc-4525 N. \nKenmore Avenue\". The Proposed Route on Sidewalk is stated as \"We. will erect tents on the \n' \npublic right of way of the pedestrian mall, but not on the sidewalks, but \\VC anticipate brief' \nobstructions of the public sidewalks as our people congregate and move tents\". The Estimated \nNumber of Participants is given as \"40\". \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 11 of 19 PageID #:11\nBy Jetter dated April 3, 2017, Mr. Michael Simm1, Assistant Commissioner, Public Way Permit \nDivision, Division of Infrastructure M anagcmcnt, for the City of Chicago's Department of \nTransportation (CDOT) advised Appellant that the submitted Notification was \"Denied\". The \nreason provided stated \"You did not provide the required Public Way Usc permits required under \nM.C.C. Section I 0-28-01 O(b)(l 0) with your notification for the erection of tents. Consequently, \nyou notification of a public assembly is denied as the stated purpose of the assembly is expressly \nfor an unlawful purpose prohibited under tl1e Municipal Code of Chkugo\". The Jcncr further \nprovided ''As an altcmate to your public assembly, you may engage in a public'assembly at your \nrequested Jocmion at the \"Pedestrian mall between N. Kenmore Avenue at N. Broadway Avenue \nand N. Kenmore Street where the pavement begins Y, block south ofW. Wilson Avenue-·-4525 \nN. Kenmore Avenue,\" for your requested date and time, Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10 ;00 a.m. to \nWednesday~ November 22, 2017, at 12;00 p.m. for any lawful purpose subject to reasonable. \ntime, place, and manner restrictions as may be applicahlc.\". \nOn April 6, 2017, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal of the denial of the Notification of \nPublic Assembly.  A hearing was conducted on April 12,2017. \nSUMMARY OF THE TESTIMONY \nThe Appellant requested a continuance for the purpose of preparing a response to the City's \nMotion to Dismiss that was filed and served upon Appellant on April 11, 2017. Disposition of \nthe Motion \\Vas reserved pending brief argument on the City's Motion. The City's Motion to \nDismiss was denied and therefore the Appellant's Motion to continue was unnecessary and also \ndenied. The Appellant's Motion to Suhpoena Michael Simon to provide testimony in support of \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 12 of 19 PageID #:12\nhis Affidavit and to be cross examined was denied as unnecessary to present evidence that is \nrelevant and relates to a contested issue in the c.-1se. \nThe City first called Luis Benitez to testify.  Mr. Benitez \\Vas questioned as to his employment \nhistory, educational background, and prolessionnllicenses and it was stipulated by Appellant that \nMr. Benitez was qualified as an expert witness in the field of structural engineering. After further \nquestioning Mr. Benitez opined that tents are structmcs~ that a permit is required to erect tents on \nthe public way; and that erecting tents on the public way without a Public Way Usc permit poses \na danger to public safety. Upon cross examination Mr. Beriitez staled that he k11ows of no \nhomeless individuals that have applied for and received Public Way Use permits, that he is mvarc \nof tents that have been erected on public property and under certain viaducts, and that he has no \nknowledge of citations issued by CDOT for problems with tents or ofhann to individuals \nconcerning tents. On redirect Mr. Benitez indicated that he is not involved '\"'ith CDOT citations \nand that citations arc issued by Public Way Inspectors. On re-cross Mr. Benitez stated that he has \nno knowledge of citations issued for violations for tents erected under the viaducts. The City then \nrested its case reserving the opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses. City's exhibits A, the resume \nof Luis Benitez, B, the Notification of Public A~sembly, C, the City's denial letter, and D, the \nAfl1davit of Michael Simon were marked as City's exhibits and admitted in evidence. \nThe Appellant first called Andy ·n1ayer to testify. Mr. Thayer \\.Vas questioned as to his \nemployment, his current housing status. and his history in submitting Notifications for Public \nAssemblies. Mr. Thayer stated that he is n member of an organization that advocates for the. \nrights of the homeless. Mr. Thayer was questioned concerning an incident at the mall in \nScpt~mber 2016 and Appellant offered several photos. The City objeetcd based on relevancy and \n_' , \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 13 of 19 PageID #:13\nthe OQicction was sustained. Further direct examination of Mr. Thayer revealed that he believes \nthat the homeless now living under the viaducts at Wilson and Lake. Shore Drive will be \ndisplaced by the reconstruction of the viaducts scheduled for this year and that there is very little \nspace for the homeless to stay. Mr. Thayer staled that he put the erection of tents in the \nNotification or Public Assembly because he wanted a safe place for the displaced homeless to go \nand be free from the interference of City workers. Mr. Thayer testified that the language of the \nordinance does not make specific reference to any erections on the public assembly or \nrestrictions as to what can be built or maintained as pm; of the public asscmb!y.' His direct \nexamination concluded ''vith his statement that he has not witnessed any danger to public safety \nat the Stewan School mall, the Wilson viaduct, or the Lawrence area. Upon cross examination, \nMr. Thayer states that there is no reference 10 10-28-010 in I 0-8-334 but there is reference to \nother laws, but not any dealing with graffiti, murder, or theft. Mr. Thayer also testified on cross \nexamination that no one f:i'om the City told him that the City was unable or unwilling to house \nthe homeless. Mr. Thayer acknowledged that the purpose of the Notification is because he and \nothers want to erect tents at 4525 N Kenmore for the homeless. He believes that there would be \nongoing obstructions of pedestrian traffic around the entrances as people move in and out. \nMr. Thayer testified that he has not nor does he know of anyone that has applied for a Publit; \nWay Use p\\-muit at the location. On redirect Mr. Thayer tcsti11cd that he is an advocate for the \nhomeless, that he is known to some City employees, that he has not been contacted by the City, \nthat he has mit been notilied thatlh~ ordinance reyuires a Public Way Use permit, that the \nwording of the ordinance docs not require it, and that the denial is the only notice he received. \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 14 of 19 PageID #:14\nThe City next called rcbullal witness Alisa Sanchez-Rodriguez. Ms. Sanchez-Rodriguez was \nquestioned as to her employment history and e~iucational background. Ms. Sanchez-Rodriguez \nstat~d that she is ctirrcntly employed by the City of Chicago's Department of Family and Support \nServices (DFSS) as the Deputy Commissioner for Homeless Programs. Under dire:.~ct \nexamination, Ms. Sanchez-Rodriguez testified as tCl the various programs the City has in place \nand is developing thnt provide support services for the homt:-lcss. Ms. Sanchez-Rodriguez further \ntestified that the main concerns for homeless t~ncampments known as tent cities is sanitation \nrelated. Watt'r. toilet facilities. and the aceumulation of garbage. She indicateel'ihat the City \noffers shelter to anyone who asks, that she knows of no instances where anyone has been denied \nshelter, and that if necessary the City will go to outside providers for additional space. City· \nexhibits E through J were marked and admitted as evidence. On cross examination Ms. Sanche:t. \nRodrigucz acknov. .r lcdged that diffL~rcnt methodologies are used for counting the number of \nhomeless but that the City uses the one day count which is the inethod approved by HUD. When \nasked the hypothetical question if the iota! number of known homeless requested housing could \nthe City provide shelter for them the witness answered no. Ms. Sanchc7.-Rodriguez ans\\vered \nfurther questions on cross concerning various exhibits. Finally. when asked if she knew of any \napplications from the homeless for a Public Way Use permit Ms. Sanchez-Rodriguez answered \nno. Petitioner's exhibits A through Ci were marked and admitted as evidence. \nNo further witnesses were called. \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 15 of 19 PageID #:15\nFlNDI Nc;s OF FACT \nl.  Appellant submitted the Notification of Public Assembly on March 30, 2017 at 2:55p.m. \n2.  The Municipal Code of Chicago section 10-8-334 governs Public Assemblies and defines \na Public Assembly in subsection (a) in pertinent part as \"a company of persons coJJected \ntogether in one place on the sidewalk, or any organized march or procession of persons \nupon the sidewalk, which is reasonably anticipated to interfere with or impede the flow of \npedestrian traffic ... \" \n3.  The Municip::1J Code of Chicago section 9-64-010 defines \"sidewalk\" ~s· \"that portion of a \npublic way hct'vvccn the curb, or the I<Heral lines of the roadway, and the adjacent \nproperty lines, intended for the usc of pedestrians\". \n4.  The Municipal Code of Chicago section 1- .4-090(f) defines public way as\" any sidewalk, \nstreet, alley, highway or other public thoroughfare\". \n5.  The Assembly was to start on Friday April J4 , 2017 at I 0:00a.m. and continue through \nWednesday November 22, 2017 at 12 noon. \n6.  The location and address of the Assembly was \"the pedestrian mall between N. Kenmore \nA venue at N. Broadway A venue and N. Kenmore Street where the pavement begins 1/2 \nblock south of W. Wilson Avenue-- 4525 N Kenmore\". \n7.  The proposed route on sidewalks was described as \"we will erect tents on the public right \nof way of the pedestrian mall, but not on the. sidewalks, but we anticipate brief \nobstructions of the public. sidewalks as our people congregate and move tents\". \n8.  The estim<tted number of participants was \"40''. \n9.  On April 3, 2017, a letter written by Michael Simon. the assistant Commissioner, Public \nWay Permit Division. Dcpartm~nt of Infrastructure Management was served on \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 16 of 19 PageID #:16\nAppellant and advised Appellant that th~ NotiJication of Public Assembly was denied \"as \nthe stated purpose ofthc Assembly is cxpn:ssly for an tmlawful purpose under the \nMunicipal Code of Chicago\" because no Public Way Use permits a~ req\\lircd undel· \nM.C.C. ScctiOil-10-28-01 O(b)(J 0) \\Vere snbmitted with the Notification. \n10.  The denial letter dated April 3, 2017 provided that as an nltcrnate Appellant may engage \nin a Public Assembly ut the exact same requested lo<.·ation and address for the exact same \nrequested date and time for any Jm.vful purpose sul~jcct to reasonable time, place, and \nJ11anner restricti(llis as ma)' be applicable.  · \n1 I.  On April 6, 2017 AppcJlant filed a timely Notice of Appeal with the Department of \nAdministrative Hearing. \n12.  The Municipal Code of Chic<:1go section I 0-8-334( c) provides that \"any public assembly \norganizer ':vho wishes to arpeal the commissioner's decision regarding an altemate date, \ntime, location or route may appeal by notifying the department ofadministn'ltive hearings \nof tl1e person's intent to appeal ... \" \n13.  I lind that the alternate date, time. Joc.ation or route as given in the denial Jetter from \nMichael Simon dated April 3, 2017 will to the extent practicable, have comparable public \nvisibility, and a similar route, location, and date to that of the proposed public assembly. \nSUMMARY OF TilE ARGUMI~NTS \nThe Appellant contends that the Notification of Public Assembly was wrongly denied because \nthe City is requiring Public Way Use Permits for the erection of tents that is not found in the. \nordinance governing Public Assemblies. The Appellant sets forth various Constitutional \narguments under the first and eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. ns vvcll as under \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/15/17 Page 17 of 19 PageID #:17\nArticle 1 section 5 of the 1llinois Constitution and the Illinois Homeless B'ill of Rights.

This  lawsuit  began  as  an  administrative  appeal  from  a  denial  of \nPlaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly pursuant to §10-8-334 of the Municipal \nCode of Chicago (MCC). However, Defendants removed the case to federal court as \nraising an issue of federal law. Therefore, the case is now more properly a federal civil \nrights claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs allege that the City’s refusal to approve Plaintiffs’ permit \napplication, in conjunction with the City’s removal of the homeless “tent city” located \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 2 of 37 PageID #:722\nunder the viaducts under Lake Shore Drive at Wilson Avenue and Lawrence Avenue \nand subsequent acts of the City denying plaintiffs any venue to establish their protest \nencampment, arresting and threatening to arrest those that do so, and threatening \nto seize plaintiffs’ personal property, violates the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; and Illinois Bill of Rights \nfor the Homeless Act, 775 ILCS 45/1 et. seq. (hereinafter Homeless Bill of Rights). \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys fees. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Jurisdiction  is  proper  in  this  court  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §1331 \nbecause this case alleges violations of Plaintiffs’ rights under federal law and under \n42 U.S.C. §1983. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state law \nclaims pursuant to 13 U.S.C. §1367. The Court has the authority to grant declaratory \nrelief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202. \n4.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), as all \nthe events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in Cook County. \n5.  The Court has authority to award attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§1988.  \nFactual Allegations Common to All Counts \nThe Parties \n6.  Plaintiff Uptown Tent City Organizers (“UTCO”) is an unincorporated \nassociation, the members of which include individuals currently residing on the \nstreets and other non-permanent locations, primarily using personally-owned tents \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 3 of 37 PageID #:723\nfor shelter, and supportive housed community members, primarily based in the \nUptown neighborhood. The objective of this organized collective is to raise awareness \nabout the plight of homelessness across the city of Chicago, to provide services for \nhomeless  individuals,  and  to  advocate  for  those  who  have  been  excluded  from \nmainstream society. As an organization, UTCO believes that ending homelessness is \na  political,  societal,  and  moral  responsibility  that  can  only  be  confronted  when \nhomeless individuals come out of the shadows and into open public space. \n7.  Plaintiff Andy Thayer is a 30-year resident of Uptown, a community \nactivist, and a member of Uptown Tent City Organizers.  \n8.  Defendant  City  of  Chicago  (City)  is  a  municipal  corporation,  duly \nincorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois and located in Cook County, \nIllinois. \n9.  Defendant Department of Administrative Hearings is a division of the \nCity of Chicago responsible for appeals from denials of permit applications, MCC §10-\n8-334. \n10.  Defendant  Chicago  Department  of  Transportation  (CDOT)  is  a \ndepartment of the City of Chicago responsible for issuing permits for public assembly \npursuant to MCC §10-8-334 and public use pursuant to MCC §10-28-010. \nHistory of Homeless Tent Encampments in Uptown and \nDefendants’ Harassment of Homeless Individuals \n \n11.  The city of Chicago, in general, and Uptown in particular, does not have \nenough shelter beds to house the homeless. Further, upon information and belief, \ncertain populations of homeless people, such as married couples without children, are \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 4 of 37 PageID #:724\nnot allowed to remain overnight together in any existing shelter. \n12.  Prior to August 17, 2015, homeless people had set up tent encampments \nand were sleeping in open public areas and on parts of public sidewalks located under \nthe Lake Shore Drive viaducts at Wilson and Lawrence Avenues in Uptown. The \nencampment did not block the public’s access to the public throughway.  \n13.  Prior to August 17, 2015, Defendant City of Chicago, acting through \nvarious  police  officers,  had  on  numerous  occasions  threatened  to  arrest  these \nhomeless people for sleeping on public sidewalks, or to confiscate or destroy their \ntents and other property. \n14.  On  the  night  of  August  17,  2015,  a  group  of homeless  and  housed \nUptown residents planned an overnight protest on the edge of the public park near \nthe Wilson Avenue Lake Shore Drive bridge viaduct.  \n15.  Members  of  the  Chicago  Police  Department  threatened  to  arrest \neveryone—homeless residents and protesters—when the park closed at 11 pm.  \n16.  As the viaducts under Lake Shore Drive began to fill, several homeless \npeople began to sleep in the public mall space in front of the now-shuttered Stewart \nElementary School, 4525 N. Kenmore Avenue (Stewart Mall). Stewart Mall is public \nland containing a publically accessible area located across the street from Alderman \nJames Cappleman’s office, and is highly visible by the thousands of people who use \nUptown’s major commercial street, Broadway, daily.   \n17.  From July through September 2016, 20 to 30 homeless residents erected \ntents and lived on the Stewart Mall, creating a tent city.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 5 of 37 PageID #:725\n18.  In addition to needing safe shelter, the Plaintiffs sought to erect tents \nat the Stewart Mall because it is highly visible to people frequenting the businesses \nin the Uptown community and a presence there would draw attention to the lack of \naffordable housing options and the lack of services available for people experiencing \nhomelessness. Occupation is the Plaintiffs’ chosen form of expression; reclaiming \npublic space in a stationary location over an extended period of time provides for \ngreater dissemination of its message and offers the only rebuff against pervasive \nattempts to silence it and relegate homeless individuals to the margins of society. \n19.  Many of the tents in the encampment were the same orange-colored \ntents, given out by UTCO. Press conferences were held under the viaducts and several \nmarches on issues of homelessness and affordable housing were also staged from that \nlocation.    The  tent  city  community  put  up  signs  educating  people  about  police \nharassment and announcing upcoming protests and marches.  At various times, \nUTCO homeless members who lived under the viaducts and at the Stewart Mall \nhanded out informational leaflets.  \n20.  On  September  26,  2016,  Morningside  Construction  Managers,  LLC \n(MCM)—with heavy police presence in tow and under the guise of a public way \npermit—fenced  off  the  Stewart  Mall,  evicting  the  homeless  and the  rest  of  the \nprotesters from the Stewart Mall. No construction occurred at the adjacent school, \nnor was any equipment staged in the Stewart Mall, during the entire period of the \nMCM permit. The MCM permit expired on March 18, 2017, and was not renewed. \n21.  Many  of  the  individuals  living  at  the  Stewart  Mall  encampment \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 6 of 37 PageID #:726\nrelocated to encampments under the Lake Shore Drive viaducts over Wilson and \nLawrence Avenues.  \nDefendants’ Denial of Plaintiffs’ Public Use Permit Application \n22.  Sometime during the winter of 2016–17, Plaintiffs learned of a plan by \nIllinois  Department  of  Transportation  to  reconstruct  or  otherwise  perform \nsubstantial repairs to the Lake Shore Drive viaducts over Wilson and Lawrence \nAvenues. \n23.  The City of Chicago stated that this reconstruction would require the \nhomeless people living under those viaducts to move. The City of Chicago had stated \nthat it is not required to find alternative housing for those people displaced by Illinois \nDepartment of Transportation’s project, nor did it intend to do so.  \n24.  As a response to this information, on March 7, 2017, Plaintiff Andy \nThayer (Thayer) on behalf of Uptown Tent Community Organizers (UTCO) filed a \nNotification of Public Assembly pursuant to MCC §10-8-334 for the Stewart Mall set \nto begin the day after the Morning Side Construction’s MCM permit expired. The \npurpose of requesting this permit was two-fold: to provide an alternative location to \nlive for the homeless people living in tents under the Wilson and Lawrence viaducts; \nand to erect a tent city in a highly visible location in order to protest the lack of \naffordable housing in the City of Chicago. \n25.  On March 15, 2017, the Chicago Department of Transportation denied \nThayer’s permit application, citing unspecified “safety” concerns to justify its tardy \nresponse to the application. Under MCC §10-8-334(b)(2), “[s]uch public assemblies \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 7 of 37 PageID #:727\nshall be allowed unless the commissioner notifies, in writing by mail, fax, or e-mail \nthe person or organization giving the notice, within two business days after receipt of \nnotice of the public assembly.” As permitted under MCC § 10-8-334, Thayer appealed \nthe City’s rejection.  \n26.  On March 22, 2017, two days before the appeals hearing was to take \nplace, Thayer received a call from Kelley A. Gandurski, Senior Assistant Corporation \nCounsel at the Chicago Law Department. She stated that MCM’s permit was “illegal” \nand that the City had forced MCM to remove the fencing and “no trespassing” signs \nblocking the Stewart Mall. On this basis, she requested that that Thayer withdraw \nhis appeal. Upon confirming that the Stewart Mall was indeed reopened, the next day \nThayer withdrew the appeal, noting in an email to Ms. Gandurski that any attempt \nto close off the Stewart Mall again to the public would be taken as a sign of bad faith \nand possible legal action. \n27.  Within two hours after Thayer withdrew the appeal, MCM again erected \nthe fences blocking the Stewart Mall. The next day, Thayer sent another email to the \nDepartment of Administrative Hearings requesting a new appeals hearing, which \nwas granted and set for March 30, 2017. Prior to the March 30 hearing, the fences \naround the mall were again taken down. On March 28, 2017, the City filed a Hearing \nMemorandum outlining the City's posture on the permit request. \n28.  At the March 30, 2017, hearing, the City successfully moved to dismiss \nthe hearing on the grounds of mootness, arguing that because the Stewart Mall was \nalready open and accessible to the public, Thayer’s public assembly permit was \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 8 of 37 PageID #:728\nunnecessary.  \n29.  With  the  appeal  of  the  original  permit  application  mooted,  that \nafternoon Plaintiffs filed a more narrowly tailored Notification of Public Assembly. \nThis permit notification was for a period of six months and included the use of tents \nby those assembled. On April 3, 2017, the City again denied Plaintiffs’ Notification of \nPublic Assembly. \n30.  Plaintiffs appealed and a full administrative hearing was held on April \n12, 2017. On April 11, 2017, less than 24 hours prior to the hearing, the City filed a \nwritten motion to dismiss arguing that Plaintiffs’ intention to allow for the erection \nof tents was an illegal, unpermitted act which should vacate the public assembly \npermit application without right of appeal. Plaintiffs’ counsel asked for a continuance \nto file a written response, but both the request for a continuance and to file a written \nresponse to the motion to dismiss were denied. \n31.  At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued that the City’s requirement to obtain a \npublic way use permits pursuant to MCC §10-28-010 for people to erect tents, which \ncan only be granted by passage of special ordinances by the City Council of Chicago, \nviolated the First and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the broader \npublic assembly protections of Illinois Article 1, the Illinois Homeless Bill of Rights \n(775 ILCS 45/1), and Chicago’s Public Assembly Ordinance (MCC §10-8-334).  \n32.  The City argued that a tent is a “structure” under subsection MCC §10-\n28-010(b)(10), and therefore, Plaintiffs were required to apply for a public way use \npermit rather than a public assembly permit. The City further argued that the denial \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 9 of 37 PageID #:729\nletter provided Thayer with an adequate time and place alternative as required under \nthe ordinance. \n33.  On April 14, 2017, Senior Administrative Law Judge Frank Lombardo \nissued the “Findings Decision and Order” (sic) affirming the City's denial of the \npublic assembly permit application. \n34.  MCC §10-8-334(b)(2) provides that “[s]uch public assemblies shall be \nallowed unless the commissioner notifies, in writing . . . that there is a significant \npublic safety issue, limited to those set forth for parades in Section 10-8-330(g)(1)–\n(4).” CDOT’s and the City’s notice of denial only stated there were “significant public \nsafety issues” but did not state what subsection of MCC §10-8-330(g)(1)–(4) was \napplicable nor did it specify what constituted the specific public safety issue. CDOT’s \nand the City’s failure to provide a legal notice of denial and the misapplication of \nMCC §10-8-334 to Plaintiffs resulted in a violation of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nand Illinois Article 1 rights.  Notably, in denying the second public assembly permit, \nthe City did not cite any safety issues. \n35.  MCC §10-8-334(b)(2) further provides that when an assembly permit is \ndenied,  the  City  shall  provide  “an alternate  date,  time, location or  route.   This \nalternate, to the extent practicable, shall authorize a public assembly that will have \ncomparable public visibility, and a similar route, location and date to that of the \nproposed public assembly.” The City’s alternative assembly offered the same dates \nand location, but not the same manner or public visibility of Plaintiffs’ planned public \nassembly. As applied to Plaintiffs, the City violated the public assembly ordinance in \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 10 of 37 PageID #:730\nviolation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment and Illinois Article 1.  \n36.  Nothing in the language of MCC §10-8-334 prohibits the erection of non-\npermanent  structures  as  part  of  a  public  assembly.  On  information  and  belief, \nsignificant  numbers  of  public  assemblies  include  the  erection  of  non-permanent \nstructures as part of the assembly that are dismantled at the end of the assembly. \nSuch structures include scaffolding for speakers and elevated stages, all erected on \nthe public way. On information and belief, none of the public assemblies containing \nsuch structures obtained public use permits. As applied to Plaintiffs, the City and \nCDOT’s requirement that Plaintiffs obtain a public use permit violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the First Amendment. \n37.  MCC §10-28-015 provides that applications for public use permits are \nsubmitted to the commissioner of business affairs and consumer protection.  MCC \n§10-28-015(c) provides “[i]f the commissioner finds that the applicant meets the \napplicable  requirements,  the  commissioner  shall  provide  the  application  to  the \nalderman  of  the  affected  ward.  Upon  passage  of  an  ordinance  approving  the \napplication, the commissioner shall issue the public way use permit to the applicant. \nIf approval by ordinance is withheld, the commissioner shall deny the application and \nshall notify the unsuccessful applicant in writing of the denial within ten business \ndays after the denial. \n38.  On information and belief, Alderman James Cappleman, Alderman of \nthe 46th Ward, where the Stewart Mall is located, would not submit an ordinance for \npublic use for an assembly of homeless people and their supporters to include tents \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 11 of 37 PageID #:731\nto the Chicago City Council. \n39.  The requirement that a public assembly with certain types of structures \nobtain  a  public  use  permit  pursuant  to  MCC  §10-8-334  and  10-28-010  et.  seq. \nconstitutes an express municipal policy of the City. Such policy subjects the homeless \nto citations for ordinance violations and possible arrest.  \n40.  As a result of Defendants’ denial of Plaintiffs’ application for a public \nuse permit, the present litigation was filed.  \n41.  On  August  27,  2017,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  for  a  Preliminary \nInjunction,  enjoining  the  Defendants  from  forcibly  removing  the  homeless  tent \nencampment from the viaducts of Wilson and Lawrence Avenues without a viable \nalternative location for the encampment to relocate. (Dkt. 25).  \n42.  The Plaintiffs sought and received a September 14, 2017 hearing (Dkt. \n34) on their motion for a preliminary injunction to preserve the tent communities \nbeneath Wilson and Lawrence Avenues.   \n43.  At this hearing, City representatives stated that the City did not have \nany intention to arrest homeless individuals or unlawfully dispose of their property.  \n44.  The  motion  was  denied  on  September  15,  2017,  with  eviction  to \ncommence on Monday, September 18, 2017.  \nPost-Injunction Hearing Evictions \n45.  By September 17, 2017, homeless residents who were previously living \nunder the Lawrence viaduct moved to the Wilson viaduct to live with the residents \nstill residing there. On this date, 20-25 homeless residents were still living in tents \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 12 of 37 PageID #:732\nunder the Wilson viaduct.  \n46.  On the afternoon of September 17, 2017, the 20-25 homeless residents \nand many housed UTCO members spent approximately 4-5 hours moving everyone’s \ntents and other belongings to relocate the protest encampment to a grassy strip west \nof the Wilson Avenue viaduct, between the southbound exit ramp of Lake Shore Drive \nat Wilson and the intersection of Wilson Avenue and North Marine Drive. No person’s \nbelongings were obstructing the sidewalk and, on information and belief, the specific \narea was west of the construction zone covered by the viaduct reconstruction permit. \n47.  On  September  18,  2017,  the  day  of the eviction from  the viaducts, \nChicago Police Department officers alleged that the new area of the encampment was \ncovered by the construction permit for the Lake Shore Drive viaducts and that \nencampment members would have to move again or risk arrest and confiscation of \ntheir possessions.  \n48.  Chicago Police Department officers ordered the dispersal of the tent \ncommunity at the new Wilson Avenue location, threatening arrest and confiscation \nof the homeless’ possessions if they failed to disperse.    \n49.  Around 7:00 AM on the morning of September 18, 2017, more than 15 \nChicago police officers assembled near the area where the tents had moved. A few \nhours later, approximately 40 police officers were present. The officers threatened to \nmove everybody and stated that they could not be there; once they were finished \nsecuring the viaduct, they told them they would move every person out of the area.  \nMany officers were standing in the viaduct where the tents had moved from, and \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 13 of 37 PageID #:733\nfences were put up around the area under the viaduct. Police officers then lined up in \na row on Wilson Avenue between the viaduct and Marine Drive behind some of the \ntents. When asked questions by homeless residents or community members present, \nthe officers would not respond. When the officers were asked to cite an ordinance, \nthey did not respond or give a reason. \n50.  During  this  time,  a  truck  from  Chicago  Streets  and  Sanitation \nDepartment was parked on the grass on the south side of Wilson Avenue.   \n51.  A Chicago Police Department SUV was parked at the intersection of \nWilson Avenue and Marine Drive to block cars from entering Lakeshore Drive at \nWilson Avenue. \n52.  Chicago Police Officer with star #66 walked toward a row of tents on the \nsouth sidewalk. Officer #66 sought to frustrate a number of local residents and UTCO \nmembers who were asking questions and filming what was happening. The officer \nstated that this was a permitted area due to the construction under the viaduct. When \nasked if people could move one block west out of the permitted area and be left alone, \nofficer #66 said they would have to check the permit. He also said that the area was \na public way. When asked where people should go, the officer responded by saying, \n“DFSS,” —the Chicago Department of Family Support and Services.  \n53.  Officer #66 walked up to the first tent in the line and unzipped the tent \nto look inside.  The Chicago Streets and Sanitation Department workers then lifted \nthe tent, collapsed it, and moved it across the sidewalk to drop it in the park.  The \nworkers announced that they would move the tents and possessions to 850 W. Wilson. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 14 of 37 PageID #:734\nThe workers then moved another tent and asked people to move off the sidewalk.  \n54.  Other Chicago police offers were acting in a similar manner.   \n55.  Many of the homeless residents had signs posted outside their tents \nstating “Homes Not Shelters,” “Stop Harassing the Homeless,” and other similar \nmessages. Many residents and bystanders chanted together as tents were being \nremoved: “Stop Harassing the Homeless.”  \n56.  In  response  to  the  threats  of  arrest  and  dispossession  of  personal \nproperty, on the afternoon of Monday, September 18, 2017, the tent encampment \nmoved a second time to the 4500 block of North Marine Drive, in the public way \nbetween the sidewalk and the curb and stayed the night there. At no point did the \nencampment block public access to the public way.  \n57.  Around 12:15 AM on the morning of September 19, 2017, an unknown \npolice officer told a man in a sleeping bag at the park that he would be ticketed if he \ndid not move.  The man stated that it was hard to move and Plaintiff Andy Thayer \noffered to help him. The officer stated that family services would be there in the \nmorning to help him get somewhere. The man replied that he had already spoken \nwith them. The man then moved his belongings with the help of bystanders.  \n58.  On Tuesday, September 19, 2017, Chicago Police officers stated that \npeople in the tent encampment on North Marine Drive would be subject to arrest and \ntheir possessions confiscated if they did not move. \n59.  Later in the early morning of September 19, 2017, DFSS workers came \nto tell people they could move to Pacific Garden Mission for shelter. Yet, this was not \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 15 of 37 PageID #:735\na viable option for many of the homeless residents there because: \na.  Homeless  individuals  without  funds  are  stranded  in  the \nneighborhood of the Pacific Garden Mission without the means to \nreturn to  their  neighborhoods where  they  have  access  to  social \nservices and medical care; \nb.  Pacific Garden Mission’s barracks environment is incompatible with \nthose individuals with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) from \nmilitary service. Approximately 10% of the homeless in Chicago are \nmilitary veterans; \nc.  Pacific Garden Mission is rife with bedbugs and other vermin, theft \nand sporadic violence; and \nd.  “The Gospel of Jesus Christ is preached faithfully four times daily, \nbefore meals and before bed.” (Pacific Garden Mission website) So \neven  those  who  arrive  after  the  evening  meal  are  subjected  to \nChristian preaching in violation of their First Amendment rights.  \n60.  Later, in morning of September 19, 2017, when housed UTCO and other \ncommunity organizers were no longer at the site, many police officers came and told \nall of the homeless residents that they had 15 minutes to move their belongings. \nChicago  Streets  and  Sanitation  Department  workers  also  arrived  and  brought \nmultiple trucks.   \n61.  Approximately six police officers began going tent-to-tent to tell people \nthat they had to move. They asked if people needed medical attention and cited MCC \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 16 of 37 PageID #:736\n§10-28-010 saying people can’t place any structure on the public way. One officer \nmarked tents for removal with blue masking tape after warnings had been given.   \n62.  When officers received no response at some of the tents visited, the \nofficers removed tarps or blankets covering the corresponding tents. The officers then \nunzipped the tents to look inside. Simultaneously, another officer kicked a protest \nsign regarding homelessness out of the way.  \n63.  An officer stated, “Everything will be tagged. If there is nobody here, it’s \ngarbage.” Two trucks for the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation were \nwaiting on Marine Drive behind the tents with many workers present. The Chicago \nDepartment of Streets and Sanitation confiscated one unattended tent that morning. \nThe workers were heard laughing as they removed the tent to place in the truck. They \nalso removed some other personal items.  \n64.  One of the homeless residents responded, “How many times are we going \nto have to move? 18, 20, 20, 25 times?” \n65.  On the afternoon of September 19, 2017, for the third time, homeless \nresidents packed their belongings. Residents moved across the sidewalk to a piece of \nland owned by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District located on the south side \nof West Wilson Avenue between Marine Drive and Clarendon Avenue.  Police officers \nstated that it was federal property, and thus it was up to another authority to \ndetermine whether people could stay on the land.   \n66.  In the evening of September 19, 2017, retired police officer and current \nMetropolitan  Water  Reclamation  District  employee  Ralph  Chiczewski  informed \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 17 of 37 PageID #:737\npeople at the third tent encampment that if they did not leave by 11 PM that evening \nthat they would be arrested and their possessions confiscated.  \n67.  Around 8:30 PM the evening of September 19, 2017, most of the people \non the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District property moved their belongings to \na fourth location on the 4900 block of North Sheridan Avenue. Many housed UTCO \nmembers came to help people move their tents and belongings for the fourth time in \nthree days. The new location was an abandoned lot with a broken fence and gate. \nHomeless persons and UTCO members repaired the fence and gate.  People then set \nup their tents and most went to sleep.   \n68.  Later,  on the  night of September  19,  2017,  police  officer  John Doe \napproached Plaintiff Andy Thayer and other UTCO members and stated that the \npolice would find out who the owner was, but that they couldn’t evict the tent city \nthat night.   \n69.  On September 20, 2017, representatives of Chicago Police Department \nordered plaintiffs to vacate the parcel claiming the owner had denied plaintiffs access \nto the parcel. The officers evicted everyone from the property, saying they had broken \nin. The police said there was a complaining witness but did not provide any name or \nmore information. Such representatives refused to provide plaintiffs with the name \nand contact information of the owner. \n70.  One of the police officers placed a “No Trespassing” sign on the fence \nthat had not been on the property the night before. More than ten (10) police officers \nwere in the area at this time.  \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 18 of 37 PageID #:738\n71.  The officers then told everyone that they had to leave immediately, \nstating, “If you go back on that property, you do not have permission. You’ll be subject \nto arrest.” The officers would not let anyone on to the property to help homeless \npersons pack their belongings. A housed UTCO member brought a moving truck to \nhelp the homeless move their possessions again.  \n72.  Simultaneously, one of the homeless women asked for water and began \nhaving a seizure from the stress of the events.   \n73.  Tyler Dean Hamlin, a UTCO member, refused to leave the parcel and \nwas arrested for trespass. \n74.  In the course of these interactions, Chicago Police Commander informed \nPlaintiffs that no protest tent encampment would be allowed anywhere in Uptown \nand  those  who  attempted  to  set  one  up  would  be  subject  to  arrest  and  their \npossessions  confiscated.  Further,  the  Chicago  Police  Commander  asserted  that \nanyone leaving their possessions on the public way would be subject to administrative \ncitation pursuant to MCC §10-28-070 and such possessions would be confiscated. \nIrreparable Injury to Plaintiffs \n75.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  unconstitutional \napplication of MCC §10-8-334 and 10-28-010 and violation of the Illinois Homeless \nAct, the rights of Plaintiffs have been interfered with, and they are in fear of being \nticketed, arrested, and deterred from exercising their constitutionally protected First \nAmendment rights. \n76.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  unconstitutional \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 19 of 37 PageID #:739\napplication of MCC §§10-8-334 and 10-28-010 and violation of the Illinois Homeless \nAct,  the  activities  of  the  Plaintiffs  have  been  criminalized  and  they  are  being \nsubjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment \nand subject to illegal seizures and takings of their personal property in violation of \nthe Fourth and Fifth Amendments. \n77.  Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable injury by Defendants’ actions and \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief. \n78.  Plaintiffs lack any adequate remedy at law. \n79.  The  balance  of  harms  weighs  in  favor  of  Plaintiffs  and  against \nDefendants, as the issuance of the injunctive relief will not adversely affect the public \ninterest. \nCOUNT ONE \nThe City’s Denial of Plaintiff’s Application \nWas Not Justified by the Law or the Facts \n \n80.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–77. Plaintiffs’ set forth the following Specification of Errors \ncommitted  during  Plaintiffs’  Administrative  Hearing  appealing  the  denial  of \nPlaintiffs’ notification of public assembly: \n81.  The  failure  of  the  Senior  Administrative  Law  Judge  (ALJ)  Frank \nLombardo to grant Plaintiffs’ motion to issue subpoenas for Michael Simon as a \nwitness in accordance with MCC §2-14-076(f) and 2-14-080. Transcript of the Appeals \nHearing, April 12, 2017, Case No. 17 PA 000002, page 11, lines 10-17. (hereafter, T. \nP__, L__). Defendants submitted an affidavit of Mr. Simon that stated that Plaintiffs \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 20 of 37 PageID #:740\nhad not applied for a public use permit pursuant to MCC §10-28-010. \n82.  Mr. Simon, the Assistant Commissioner in the Public Way Permits \nDivision of Public Way Infrastructure of the Chicago Department of Transportation, \nis the city official in charge of granting public use permits pursuant to MCC § 10-28-\n010. Plaintiffs sought to examine Mr. Simon under oath as to what constituted the \nspecific “public safety issue” which formed the basis of CDOT’s denial of the Plaintiffs’ \npublic assembly notification. Further, Plaintiffs sought to examine Mr. Simon as to \nthe process of obtaining public use permits that require an ordinance of the City \nCouncil  of  Chicago.  Plaintiffs  sought  to  incorporate  into  the  record  the  near \nimpossibility of obtaining a public use permit for anything other than a sidewalk café \nthat  results  in  the  de  facto  criminalization  of  the  homeless  organized  in  tent \nencampments. This form of criminalization is at the core of Plaintiffs’ arguments of \ncruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n83.  The denial of Plaintiffs’ motion was arbitrary resulting in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n84.  ALJ Lombardo’s denial of a motion for continuance by Plaintiffs in order \nfor Plaintiffs to respond in writing to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Defendants filed \na Motion to Dismiss on April 11, 2017, less than 24 hours before the administrative \nhearing.  This  motion  included  a  10-page  memorandum  of  law  and  10  pages  of \nexhibits.  T.  P  6,  L 10-24. Plaintiffs requested  a  continuance  to  respond  with  a \nmemorandum of law to rebut Defendants’ arguments. T. P 5, L 11-24, P 6, L 1-2, P 8, \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 21 of 37 PageID #:741\nL 12-18. Even though ALJ Lombardo denied the Motion to Dismiss (T. P 15, L 13), \nthe denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for a continuance denied Plaintiffs’ the ability to \nsubmit a memorandum of law which would be included as part of the record. Once \nagain, this prevented the record from including arguments, reasoning, and legal \nsupport for Plaintiffs’ position that the denial of the assembly permit violates the \nFirst,  Fifth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  and \nparallel provisions under the Illinois Constitution. \n85.  The denial of Plaintiffs’ motion was arbitrary resulting in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n86.  ALJ  Lombardo  overruled  Plaintiffs’  objection  as  to  Luis  Benitez’s \nqualifications to make a legal interpretation of MCC §10-28-010(b)(10). Mr. Benitez \nis the assistant chief engineer and chief bridge engineer for the Chicago Department \nof Transportation (CDOT) and was qualified as an expert with respect to structural \nengineering. T. P 25, L 4-18. Mr. Benitez was qualified to testify whether tents are \nstructures. Mr. Benitez was asked by Defendants for an interpretation of whether \ntents for the proposed homeless encampment are structures for purposes of MCC §10-\n28-010(b)(10). T. P 28, L 11-24; P 29, L 12-24. ALJ Lombardo overruled Plaintiffs’ \nobjection that this called for a legal conclusion by Mr. Benitez. T. P 30, L 1-11. \n87.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n88.  ALJ Lombardo overruled an objection by Plaintiffs that Mr. Benitez was \nnot qualified to make a legal conclusion that the term “structure” as defined in Code \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 22 of 37 PageID #:742\nSection 13-96-480(a) should apply to the term “structure” in MCC §10-28-010(b)(10). \nT. 32, L 3-18. \n89.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n90.  ALJ  Lombardo  sustained  an  objection  by  Defendants  to  part  of \nPlaintiffs’ opening statement that provided background information on the history of \nthe public assembly ordinance. T. P 50, L 13-24, P 51, L 1-4. Denial of presenting \nbackground information on the public assembly ordinance deprived Plaintiffs of \nentering  such  information  in  the  record  for  purposes  of  making  arguments  of \nviolations of the U.S. Constitution in subsequent proceedings. \n91.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n92.  ALJ Lombardo sustained an objection on relevancy grounds regarding \nthe  introduction of  evidence  of prior  public  assembly  notifications  for  the  same \nlocation (i.e. the Stewart Mall) as the notification of public assembly under appeal in \nthe hearing. ALJ Lombardo stated, “I’m not going to allow this evidence from a \nprevious hearing. It has no bearing on what the determination will be today.” T. P 53 \nL 9-24, P 53 L 1-12. The history of prior notifications of public assembly for the \nStewart  Mall  was  relevant  to  establishing  Plaintiffs  constitutional  speech  and \nassembly claims. \n93.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 23 of 37 PageID #:743\n94.  ALJ Lombardo sustained an objection to Plaintiffs laying a foundation \nfor the notification of public assembly at issue in the hearing. T. P 69, L 9-18.  \n95.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n96.  ALJ Lombardo denied the admission of exhibits presented by Plaintiffs \nbased on Defendants’ objection as to relevancy. T. P 77, L 18. Plaintiffs’ proffered \nexhibits were photographs of the prior homeless tent encampment at the Stewart \nMall.  Plaintiffs  sought  to  enter  the  photographs  into  evidence  for  purposes  of \nestablishing the public safety and accessibility of the Stewart Mall with a homeless \ntent encampment. T. P 74, L 5-18. Plaintiffs wanted the photographic evidence and \ntestimony related thereto entered into the record for purposes of appealing the permit \ndenial on constitutional grounds. \n97.  This arbitrary denial of the admission of Plaintiffs’ exhibits resulted in \nprejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n98.  ALJ Lombardo denied Plaintiffs’ objection on grounds of relevancy to \nquestions on cross-examination of Plaintiff Thayer whether he had asked Chicago \nofficials, prior to submitting the notification for public assembly, if the City of Chicago \nwas willing to house 40 homeless people. Plaintiffs objected that notification for a \npublic assembly does not require other inquiries of city officials. T. P 97, L 16-24; P \n98, L 1-19.  \n99.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 24 of 37 PageID #:744\n100.  ALJ  Lombardo  overruled  Plaintiffs’  objection  to  the  relevancy  of \nDefendants’ questions to Plaintiff Thayer in cross-examination as to the extent of his \ncontact with the homeless. Plaintiffs argued that the notification for public assembly \nwas by an organization of the homeless and Thayer’s contacts with the homeless was \nirrelevant. ALJ Lombardo overruled the objection based on the Defendants’ argument \nof developing the record as a defense for constitutional arguments of Plaintiffs on \nappeal,  even  though  the  Plaintiffs  were  denied  the  same  requests  for  entering \nevidence and testimony into the record. See other errors delineated above. T. P 101, \nL 13-24, P 102, L 1-19. \n101.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n102.  ALJ  Lombardo  overruled  Plaintiffs’  objection based  on relevancy  to \nquestions regarding Plaintiff Thayer’s attitude toward the project to convert the \nStewart School into market rate housing. T. P117, L 3-24. ALJ Lombardo also allowed \nthe follow up question to Plaintiff Thayer as to the location of the Stewart School in \nrelation  to  the  Stewart  Mall,  which  left  the  prejudicial  implication  that  the \nnotification for public assembly was a pretext to stop the Stewart School project. T. P \n119, L 2-18. \n103.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n104.  ALJ  Lombardo  permitted  extensive  testimony  by  Alisa  Rodriquez, \nDeputy Commissioner for the homeless programs of the City of Chicago Department \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 25 of 37 PageID #:745\nof Family and Support Services, with respect to services and programs provided by \nthe City of Chicago for the homeless population as well as testimony on the number, \ncharacteristics and condition of the homeless population in Chicago. T. P 129-161. \nPrior to cross-examination of Ms. Rodriquez by Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs noted to ALJ \nLombardo  that  Plaintiffs  “were  not  allowed  the  same  scope  of  questioning  [as \nconducted by Defendants of Ms. Rodriquez] when we were conducting our direct \nexamination of Mr. Thayer.” T. P 162, L 18-20. \n105.  ALJ Lombardo erred in not permitting the same scope of questioning \nMr.  Thayer  by  Plaintiffs  on  direct  examination  as  he  allowed  on  the  direct \nexamination  of  Ms.  Rodriquez  by  Defendants.  This  arbitrary  error  resulted  in \nprejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n106.  ALJ  Lombardo’s  interpretation  of  “structure”  to  include  tents  is \narbitrary and capricious and has no basis in law or fact. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA. Enter  an  order  reversing  the  decision  of  ALJ  Lombardo,  and  granting \nPlaintiffs’ application for an assembly permit for the Stewart Mall for the \nlocation and manner as applied therefore, to run for a period of six months \nfrom the date of issuance;  \nB. Enter judgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in bringing \nthis action; and  \nC. Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 26 of 37 PageID #:746\nCOUNT TWO \nViolation of the First Amendment  \n107.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–106. \n126.  MCC §10-8-334 and 10-28-010 as applied to Plaintiffs violate the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments and constitute an unconstitutional express municipal \npolicy of the Defendants.  \n127.  Additionally, the City’s disruption and eviction of tent cities beginning \nSeptember 17, 2017 and continuing through the present day violate the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to U.S. Constitution and constitute an unconstitutional \nmunicipal policy of the Defendants. \n128.  As applied, these provisions and the City’s conduct unconstitutionally \nabridge the Plaintiffs’ right to free speech and assembly. \n129.  As  applied,  these  provisions  are  not  narrowly  tailored  to  meet  a \nsignificant governmental interest. \n130.  There are no ample alternatives channels for communication of the \nPlaintiffs message. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Grant Defendants’ appeal to reverse the Department of Administrative \nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of Defendants’ Notification of Public Assembly and \ngrant  said  Notification  of  Public  Assembly  for  the  dates,  location  and \nmanner as applied therefore; \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 27 of 37 PageID #:747\nB.  Enter a declaration that MCC §10-8-320 and MCC §10-28-010 as applied to \nthe Plaintiffs violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nC.  Enter a declaration that Defendants’ disruptions and evictions of tent cities \nthroughout the city of Chicago violate the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  \nD.  Enter  a  permanent  injunction  barring  Defendants  and  their  agents, \nservants, employees and attorneys from applying MCC  10-8-320 and MCC \n§ 10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from erecting tents as \napplied for in the Notification of Public Assembly; \nE.  Enter  a  permanent  injuction  barring  Defendants  and  their  agents, \nservants, employees and attorneys from unconstitutionally disrupting and \nevicting Plaintiffs’ tent encampments. \nF.  Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants.  \nG.  Enter  judgment  for  reasonable  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  incurred  in \nbringing this action; and \nH.  Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of the Eighth Amendment \n131.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–130. \n132.  42 U.S.C. §11302 defines those who are homeless to include: (a) an \nindividual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; (b) \nan individual or family with a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 28 of 37 PageID #:748\nplace not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for \nhuman beings; (c) an individual or family living in a supervised publicly or privately \noperated  shelter  designated  to  provide  temporary  living  arrangements;  (d)  an \nindividual who resided in a shelter or place not meant for human habitation and who \nis exiting an institution where he or she temporarily resided; (e) an individual or \nfamily who will imminently lose their housing, including housing they own, rent, or \nlive in without paying rent, and are sharing with others; (f) an individual or family \nhaving a primary nighttime residence that is a room in a hotel or motel and where \nthey lack the resources necessary to reside there for more than 14 days; (g) lacks the \nresources or support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing; and (h) \nunaccompanied youth and homeless families with children and youth who have \nexperienced a long term period without living independently in permanent housing, \nhave experienced persistent instability as measured by frequent moves over such \nperiod, and can be expected to continue in such status for an extended period of time \nbecause of chronic disabilities, chronic physical health or mental health conditions, \nsubstance addiction, histories of domestic violence or childhood abuse, the presence \nof a child or youth with a disability, or multiple barriers to employment. \n133.  Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment are in accordance with 42 U.S.C. §11302. \n134.  Pursuant to this definition, the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless \nestimates that in 2015, there were 82,212 homeless Chicagoans, of which 67,414 were \n“doubled up,” (i.e. sharing housing with others due to loss of housing, economic \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 29 of 37 PageID #:749\nhardship, or similar reason), leaving approximately 14,798 individuals in shelters or \non the streets. \n135.  Of the homeless, approximately 35,480 individuals were part of 9,925 \nfamilies with children with 8,734 families (31,222 individuals) “doubled up” leaving \n1,191 families (4,258 individuals) living in shelters or on the streets. \n136.  Approximately  44%  of  homeless  families  served  by  the  emergency \nshelter system had lived “doubled up” in the prior year. \n137.  In 2015, Chicago had 1,701 emergency shelter beds, down 17.6% from \nthe 2,064 beds in 2014. \n138.  The lack of beds in shelters for the homeless population combined with \nthe application of City ordinances in a manner which prohibits homeless people from \nlegally sleeping on public land, results in the criminalization of homeless people \nbased solely on their status as being homeless. The criminalizing of the status of \nhomelessness,  rather  than  any  conduct  by  the  homeless,  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. \n139.  On  information and belief, the  City  of Chicago,  acting  through  the \nChicago Police Department has consistently and regularly threatened to arrest the \nindividual homeless Plaintiffs in this action, who are attempting to sleep in tents or \notherwise  attempted  to  force  them  to  move  their  tents  and  all  other  personal \npossessions,  and  in  some  instances  have  actually  confiscated  their  personal \npossessions, from the public way - all without a lawful basis for doing so. Such actions \nof the Chicago Police Department constitute policies of the City. \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 30 of 37 PageID #:750\n140.  The City’s denial of the permit, coupled with the declared policy of the \nnot  allowing  anyone  to  sleep  with  or  without  tents  in  the  public  way,  without \nproviding alternative housing for the Plaintiffs, violates the Eighth Amendment \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, by criminalizing the status of \nhomelessness. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Grant  plaintiffs’  appeal  to  reverse  the  Department  of  Administrative \nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of plaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly and \ngrant said Notification of Public Assembly for the location and manner as \napplied therefore, to run for a period of six months from the date of issuance; \nB.  Enter a declaration that MCC §10-8-320 and MCC § 10-28-010 as applied \nto the Plaintiffs violates the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nC.  Enter  a  a  permanent  injunction barring  Defendants  and  their  agents, \nservants, employees and attorneys from applying MCC § 10-8-320 and MCC \n§ 10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from erecting tents as \napplied for in the Notification of Public Assembly; \nD.  Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants. \nE.  Enter  judgment  for  reasonable  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  incurred  in \nbringing this action; and \nF.  Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 31 of 37 PageID #:751\nCOUNT FOUR \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment – Illegal Seizure \n \n141.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–140. \n142.  The  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  protects \nindividuals  from  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures  of  “their  persons,  houses, \npapers, and effects.”  \n143.  It is well recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects property as \nwell as privacy. Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56 (1992).    \n144.  A  seizure  of  property  occurs  when  “there  is  some  meaningful \ninterference  with  an  individual’s  possessory  interests  in  that  property.”  U.S.  v. \nJacobson, 466 U.S. 109 (1985).   \n145.  The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is applicable to the \nDefendants’  conduct  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution.  \n146.  Though this Court has not specifically held that an individual living in \na tent has an expectation of privacy in the tent of its contents, several other Courts \nhave found an individual does have an expectation of privacy in a tent which served \nas a residence. U.S. v. Gooch, 6F 3d 673 (6th Cir. 1993).  \n147.  Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the illegal removal \nof a trailer home constituted a seizure within the Fourth Amendment framework. \nSoldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56 (1992).    \n148.  At no to time relevant hereto did Defendants obtain a valid warrant or \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 32 of 37 PageID #:752\njudicial authority to remove or seize Plaintiff’s personal property. \nWHEREFORE, Planitiffs request that this Court: \nA.

The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is applicable to the \nDefendants’  conduct  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution.  \n152.  At all times relevant hereto, the Plaintiffs have had a vested property \nright in the tents, blankets, and other personal property in their possession while \nthey were living in public areas of the City of Chicago.  \n153.

Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \nCOUNT SIX \nState Claim: Violation of the Illinois Homeless Act \n154.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–153.  \n155.  The Illinois Homeless Act states in “Sec. 5. Legislative intent. It is the \nlong-standing policy of this State that no person should suffer unnecessarily from cold \nor hunger, be deprived of shelter or the basic rights incident to shelter, or be subject \nto unfair discrimination based on his or her homeless status. At the present time, \nmany persons have been rendered homeless as a result of economic hardship, a severe \nshortage of safe and affordable housing, and a shrinking social safety net. It is the \nintent of this Act to lessen the adverse effects and conditions caused by the lack of \nresidence or a home.” \n156.  The Illinois Homeless Act states that homelessness “means the status \nof having or not having a fixed or regular residence, including the status of living on \nthe streets, in a shelter, or in a temporary residence.” Illinois Homeless Act Sec. 10(b). \n157.  The rights of the homeless pursuant to the Illinois Homeless Act include: \na.  Sec. 10(a)(1): the right to use and move freely in public spaces, \nincluding but not limited to public sidewalks, public parks, public \ntransportation, and public buildings, in the same manner as any \nother person and without discrimination on the basis of his or her \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 35 of 37 PageID #:755\nhousing status; and \nb.  Sec. 10(a)(7): the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in his \nor her personal property to the same extent as personal property in \na permanent residence \n158.  The Defendants’ policies impede the ability of homeless Plaintiffs to \nmove freely in public spaces in violation of the Illinois Homeless Act. \n159.  The Defendants’ policies prohibit use of public spaces and violate the \nreasonable expectation of privacy of the homeless Plaintiffs in violation of the Illinois \nHomeless Act. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Grant  Plaintiffs’  appeal  to  reverse  the  Department  of  Administrative \nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of Plaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly and \ngrant  said  Notification  of  Public  Assembly  for  the  dates,  location  and \nmanner as applied therefore; \nB.  Enter a declaration that MCC §10-8-320 and MCC §10-28-010 as applied to \nthe Plaintiffs violates the Illinois Homeless Act; \nC.  Enter  a  a  permanent  injunction barring  Defendants  and  their  agents, \nservants, employees and attorneys from applying MCC §10-8-320 and MCC \n§10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from erecting tents as \napplied for in the Notification of Public Assembly; \nD.  Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs against Defendants. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 36 of 37 PageID #:756\nE.

This lawsuit began as an administrative appeal from a denial of \nPlaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly pursuant to § 10-8-334 of the Municipal \nCode of Chicago (MCC). However, Defendants removed the case to federal court as \nraising an issue of federal law. Therefore, the case is now more properly a federal \ncivil rights claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs allege that the City’s refusal to approve Plaintiffs’ permit \n1 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 2 of 23 PageID #:473\napplication, in conjunction with the City’s planned removal of the homeless “tent \ncity” located under the viaducts at Wilson Avenue and Lawrence Avenue under \nLake Shore Drive, violates the First, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution; Article 1, Section 5 of the Illinois State Constitution \n(hereinafter Illinois Article 1); and Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act, 775 \nILCS 45/1 et. seq. (hereinafter Homeless Bill of Rights). Plaintiffs seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages and reasonable attorneys fees. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n3.  Jurisdiction is proper in this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this case alleges violations of Plaintiffs’ rights under federal law and under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state law \nclaims pursuant to 13 U.S.C. § 1367. The Court has the authority to grant \ndeclaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n4.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as all \nthe events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in Cook County. \n5.  The Court has authority to award attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §1988.  \nFactual Allegations Common to All Counts \nThe Parties \n6.

(Uptown). \n7.  Plaintiff Andy Thayer is a 30-year resident of Uptown, a community \nactivist, and a member of Tent City Alternative to LSD. \n8.  Defendant Department of Administrative Hearings is a division of the \nCity of Chicago responsible for appeals from denials of permit applications, MCC § \n10-8-334. \n9.  Defendant Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) is a \ndepartment of the City of Chicago responsible for issuing permits for public \nassembly pursuant to MCC § 10-8-334 and public use pursuant to MCC § 10-28-010. \n10.  Defendant City of Chicago (City) is a municipal corporation, duly \nincorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois and located in Cook County, \nIllinois. \n11.  Defendant Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is a \ndepartment of the State of Illinois responsible, among other things, for maintenance \nand repair of the Lake Shore Drive bridges over Lawrence and Wilson Avenues in \nChicago. \nDefendants’ History of Harassment of the Homeless \n12.  Prior to August 17, 2015, homeless people had set up tent \nencampments and were sleeping on the sidewalks located under the bridges at \nWilson and Lawrence Avenues in Uptown. \n3 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:475\n13.  Prior to August 17, 2015, Defendant City of Chicago, acting through \nvarious police officers, had periodically threatened to arrest these homeless people \nfor sleeping on the sidewalk, or to confiscate or destroy their tents and other \nproperty. \n14.  On the night of August 17, 2015, an ad hoc group of homeless and \nhoused Uptown residents planned an overnight protest on the edge of the park near \nthe Wilson Avenue Lake Shore Drive bridge viaduct.  \n15.  Members of the Chicago Police Department threatened to arrest \neveryone—homeless residents and protesters—when the park closed at 11 pm.  \n16.  As the viaducts under Lake Shore Drive began to fill, several homeless \npeople began to sleep in the public mall space in front of the now-shuttered Stewart \nElementary School, 4525 N. Kenmore Avenue (Stewart Mall). Stewart Mall is \nlocated across the street from Alderman James Cappleman’s office, and is highly \nvisible by the thousands of people who use Uptown’s major commercial street, \nBroadway, daily.  In addition to needing safe shelter, the Plaintiffs sought to erect \ntents in an area that is highly visible to people frequenting the businesses in the \nUptown community to draw attention to the lack of affordable housing options and \nthe lack of services available for people experiencing homelessness. \n17.  From July to September 2016, 20 to 30 homeless residents erected \ntents and lived on the Stewart Mall, creating a tent city. \n18.  On September 26, 2016, Morningside Construction Managers, LLC \n(MCM)—with heavy police presence in tow and under the guise of a public way \n4 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:476\npermit—fenced off the Stewart Mall, effectively evicting the homeless and the rest \nof the public from the Stewart Mall. No construction occurred at the adjacent school, \nnor was any equipment staged in the Stewart Mall, during the entire period of the \nMCM permit. The MCM permit expired on March 18, 2017 and was not renewed. \n19.  Sometime during the winter of 2016–17, Plaintiffs learned of a plan by \nIDOT to reconstruct or otherwise perform substantial repair of the Lake Shore \nDrive viaducts over Wilson and Lawrence Avenues. \n20.  The City of Chicago stated that this reconstruction would require the \nhomeless people living under those bridges to move. \n21.  The City of Chicago has stated that it is not required to find \nalternative housing for those people displaced by IDOT’s project, nor does it intend \nto do so. \nDefendants’ Denial of Plaintiffs’ Permit Application \n22.  On March 7, 2017, Plaintiff Andy Thayer (Thayer) on behalf of Uptown \nTent Community Organizers (UTCO) filed a Notification of Public Assembly \npursuant to MCC § 10-8-334 for the Stewart Mall set to begin the day after the \nMCM permit expired. The purpose of requesting this permit was two-fold: to provide \nan alternative location to live for the homeless people living under the Wilson and \nLawrence bridges; and to erect a tent city in a highly visible location. \n23.  On March 15, 2017, CDOT denied Thayer’s permit application, citing \nunspecified “safety” concerns to justify its tardy response to the application. Under \nMCC § 10-8-334(b)(2), “[s]uch public assemblies shall be allowed unless the \n5 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:477\ncommissioner notifies, in writing by mail, fax, or e-mail the person or organization \ngiving the notice, within two business days after receipt of notice of the public \nassembly.” As permitted under MCC § 10-8-334, Thayer appealed the City’s \nrejection.  \n24.  On March 22, 2017, two days before the appeals hearing was to take \nplace, Thayer received a call from Kelley A. Gandurski, Senior Assistant \nCorporation Counsel at the Chicago Law Department. She stated that MCM’s \npermit was “illegal” and that the City had forced MCM to remove the fencing and \n“no trespassing” signs blocking the Stewart Mall. On this basis, she requested that \nthat Thayer withdraw his appeal. Upon confirming that the Stewart Mall was \nindeed reopened, the next day Thayer withdrew the appeal, noting in an email to \nMs. Gandurski that any attempt to close off the Stewart Mall again to the public \nwould be taken as a sign of bad faith and possible legal action. \n25.  Within two hours after Thayer withdrew the appeal, MCM again \nerected the fences blocking the Stewart Mall. The next day, Thayer sent another \nemail to the Department of Administrative Hearings requesting a new appeals \nhearing, which was granted and set for March 30, 2017. Prior to the March 30 \nhearing, the fences around the mall were again taken down. On March 28, 2017, the \nCity filed a Hearing Memorandum outlining the City's posture on the permit \nrequest. \n26.  At the March 30 hearing, the City successfully moved to dismiss the \nhearing on the grounds of mootness, arguing that because the Stewart Mall was \n6 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:478\nalready open and accessible to the public, Thayer’s public assembly permit was \nunnecessary.  \n27.  With the appeal of the original permit application mooted, that \nafternoon Plaintiffs filed a more narrowly tailored Notification of Public Assembly. \nThis permit notification was for a period of six months and included the use of tents \nby those assembled. On April 3, 2017, the City again denied Plaintiffs’ Notification \nof Public Assembly. \n28.  Plaintiffs appealed and a full administrative hearing was held on April \n12, 2017. On April 11, 2017, less than 24 hours prior to the hearing, the City filed a \nwritten motion to dismiss arguing that Plaintiffs’ intention to allow for the erection \nof tents was an illegal, unpermitted act which should vacate the public assembly \npermit application without right of appeal. Plaintiffs’ counsel asked for a \ncontinuance to file a written response, but both the request for a continuance and to \nfile a written response to the motion to dismiss were denied. \n29.  At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued that the City’s requirement to obtain \na public way use permits pursuant to MCC § 10-28-010 for homeless people to erect \ntents, which can only be granted by passage of special ordinances by the City \nCouncil of Chicago, violated the First and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution, the broader public assembly protections of Illinois Article 1, the \nIllinois Homeless Bill of Rights (775 ILCS 45/1), and Chicago’s Public Assembly \nOrdinance (MCC § 10-8-334).  \n30.  The City argued that a tent is a structure under subsection MCC § 10-\n7 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:479\n28-010(b)(10), and therefore, Plaintiffs were required to apply for a public way use \npermit rather than a public assembly permit. The City argued that the denial letter \nprovided Thayer with an adequate time and place alternative as required under the \nordinance. \n31.  On April 14, 2017, Senior Administrative Law Judge Frank Lombardo \nissued the “Findings Decision and Order” (sic) affirming the City's denial of the \npublic assembly permit application. \n32.  MCC § 10-8-334(b)(2) provides that “[s]uch public assemblies shall be \nallowed unless the commissioner notifies, in writing . . . that there is a significant \npublic safety issue, limited to those set forth for parades in Section 10-8-330(g)(1)–\n(4).” CDOT’s and the City’s notice of denial only stated there were “significant \npublic safety issues” but did not state what subsection of MCC § 10-8-330(g)(1)–(4) \nwas applicable nor did it specify what constituted the specific public safety issue. \nCDOT’s and the City’s failure to provide a legal notice of denial and the \nmisapplication of MCC § 10-8-334 to Plaintiffs resulted in a violation of Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment and Illinois Article 1 rights.  Notably, in denying the second \npublic assembly permit, the City did not cite any safety issues. \n33.  MCC § 10-8-334(b)(2) further provides that when an assembly permit \nis denied, the City shall provide “an alternate date, time, location or route.  This \nalternate, to the extent practicable, shall authorize a public assembly that will have \ncomparable public visibility, and a similar route, location and date to that of the \nproposed public assembly.” The City’s alternative assembly offered the same dates \n8 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:480\nand location, but not the same manner or public visibility of Plaintiffs’ planned \npublic assembly. As applied to Plaintiffs, the City violated the public assembly \nordinance in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment and Illinois \nArticle 1.  \n34.  Nothing in the language of MCC § 10-8-334 prohibits the erection of \nnon-permanent structures as part of a public assembly. On information and belief, \nsignificant numbers of public assemblies include the erection of non-permanent \nstructures as part of the assembly that are dismantled at the end of the assembly. \nSuch structures include scaffolding for speakers and elevated stages, all erected on \nthe public way. On information and belief, none of the public assemblies containing \nsuch structures obtained public use permits. As applied to Plaintiffs, the City and \nCDOT’s requirement that Plaintiffs obtain a public use permit violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the First Amendment and Illinois Article 1. \n35.  MCC § 10-28-015 provides that applications for public use permits are \nsubmitted to the commissioner of business affairs and consumer protection. MCC § \n10-28-015(c) provides “[i]f the commissioner finds that the applicant meets the \napplicable requirements, the commissioner shall provide the application to the \nalderman of the affected ward. Upon passage of an ordinance approving the \napplication, the commissioner shall issue the public way use permit to the \napplicant. If approval by ordinance is withheld, the commissioner shall deny the \napplication and shall notify the unsuccessful applicant in writing of the denial \nwithin ten business days after the denial.” \n9 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:481\n36.  On information and belief, Alderman James Cappleman, alderman of \nthe 46th Ward in which the Stewart Mall is located, would not submit an ordinance \nfor public use for an assembly of homeless people including tents to the Chicago \nCity Council. \n37.  The requirement that a public assembly pursuant to MCC § 10-8-334 \nwith certain types of structures obtain a public use permit pursuant to MCC § 10-\n28-330 et. seq. constitutes an express municipal policy of the City. Such policy \nsubjects the homeless to citations for ordinance violations and possible arrest.  \n38.  The City of Chicago, in general, and Uptown in particular, does not \nhave enough shelter beds to house the homeless. Further, upon information and \nbelief, certain populations of homeless people, such as married couples, are not \npermitted in any existing shelter. \nIrreparable Injury to Plaintiffs \n39.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ unconstitutional \napplication of MCC §§ 10-8-334 and 10-28-010 and violation of the Illinois Homeless \nAct, the rights of Plaintiffs have been interfered with, and they are in fear of being \nticketed, arrested, and deterred from exercising their constitutionally protected \nFirst Amendment rights, and their rights to free assembly under Illinois Article 1. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ unconstitutional \napplication of MCC §§ 10-8-334 and 10-28-010 and violation of the Illinois Homeless \nAct, the activities of the Plaintiffs have been criminalized and they are being \nsubjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n10 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:482\n41.  As a direct and proximate consequence of Defendants’ \nunconstitutional application of  MCC §§ 10-8-334 and 10-28-010 and violation of the \nIllinois Homeless Act, Plaintiffs have suffered monetary damages in fines and court \ncosts and loss of possessions. \n42.  Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable injury by Defendants’ actions and \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief. \n43.  Plaintiffs lack any adequate remedy at law. \n44.  The  balance  of  harms  weighs  in  favor  of  Plaintiffs  and  against \nDefendants, as the issuance of the injunctive relief will not adversely affect the \npublic interest. \nCount One \nThe City’s Denial of Plaintiffs’ Application \nWas Not Justified by the Law or the Facts \n45.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–44. Plaintiffs’ set forth the following Specification of \nErrors committed during Plaintiffs’ Administrative Hearing appealing the denial of \nPlaintiffs’ notification of public assembly: \n46.  The failure of the Senior Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Frank \nLombardo to grant Plaintiffs’ motion to issue subpoenas for Michael Simon as a \nwitness in accordance with MCC §§ 2-14-076(f) and 2-14-080. Transcript of the \nAppeals Hearing, April 12, 2017, Case No. 17 PA 000002, page 11, lines 10-17. \n(hereafter, T. P__, L__). Defendants submitted an affidavit of Mr. Simon that stated \nthat Plaintiffs had not applied for a public use permit pursuant to MCC § 10-28-010. \n11 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:483\n47.  Mr. Simon, the Assistant Commissioner in the Public Way Permits \nDivision of Public Way Infrastructure of the Chicago Department of Transportation, \nis the city official in charge of granting public use permits pursuant to MCC § 10-28-\n010. Plaintiffs sought to examine Mr. Simon under oath as to what constituted the \nspecific “public safety issue” which formed the basis of CDOT’s denial of the \nPlaintiffs’ public assembly notification. Further, Plaintiffs sought to examine Mr. \nSimon as to the process of obtaining public use permits that require an ordinance of \nthe City Council of Chicago. Plaintiffs sought to incorporate into the record the near \nimpossibility of obtaining a public use permit for anything other than a sidewalk \ncafé that results in the de facto criminalization of the homeless organized in tent \nencampments. This form of criminalization is at the core of Plaintiffs’ arguments of \ncruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n48.  The denial of Plaintiffs’ motion was arbitrary resulting in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n49.  ALJ Lombardo’s denial of a motion for continuance by Plaintiffs in \norder for Plaintiffs to respond in writing to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nDefendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on April 11, 2017, less than 24 hours before \nthe administrative hearing. This motion included a 10-page memorandum of law \nand 10 pages of exhibits. T. P 6, L 10-24. Plaintiffs requested a continuance to \nrespond with a memorandum of law to rebut Defendants’ arguments. T. P 5, L 11-\n24, P 6, L 1-2, P 8, L 12-18. Even though ALJ Lombardo denied the Motion to \n12 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:484\nDismiss (T. P 15, L 13), the denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for a continuance denied \nPlaintiffs’ the ability to submit a memorandum of law which would be included as \npart of the record. Once again, this prevented the record from including arguments, \nreasoning, and legal support for Plaintiffs’ position that the denial of the assembly \npermit violates the First, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and parallel provisions under the Illinois Constitution. \n50.  The denial of Plaintiffs’ motion was arbitrary resulting in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n51.  ALJ Lombardo overruled Plaintiffs’ objection as to Luis Benitez’s \nqualifications to make a legal interpretation of MCC § 10-28-010(b)(10). Mr. Benitez \nis the assistant chief engineer and chief bridge engineer for the Chicago \nDepartment of Transportation (CDOT) and was qualified as an expert with respect \nto structural engineering. T. P 25, L 4-18. Mr. Benitez was qualified to testify \nwhether tents are structures. Mr. Benitez was asked by Defendants for an \ninterpretation of whether tents for the proposed homeless encampment are \nstructures for purposes of MCC § 10-28-010(b)(10). T. P 28, L 11-24; P 29, L 12-24. \nALJ Lombardo overruled Plaintiffs’ objection that this called for a legal conclusion \nby Mr. Benitez. T. P 30, L 1-11. \n52.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n53.  ALJ Lombardo overruled an objection by Plaintiffs that Mr. Benitez \nwas not qualified to make a legal conclusion that the term “structure” as defined in \n13 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:485\nCode Section 13-96-480(a) should apply to the term “structure” in MCC § 10-28-\n010(b)(10). T. 32, L 3-18. \n54.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n55.  ALJ Lombardo sustained an objection by Defendants to part of \nPlaintiffs’ opening statement that provided background information on the history \nof the public assembly ordinance. T. P 50, L 13-24, P 51, L 1-4. Denial of presenting \nbackground information on the public assembly ordinance deprived Plaintiffs of \nentering such information in the record for purposes of making arguments of \nviolations of the U.S. Constitution in subsequent proceedings. \n56.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n57.  ALJ Lombardo sustained an objection on relevancy grounds regarding \nthe introduction of evidence of prior public assembly notifications for the same \nlocation (i.e. the Stewart Mall) as the notification of public assembly under appeal \nin the hearing. ALJ Lombardo stated, “I’m not going to allow this evidence from a \nprevious hearing. It has no bearing on what the determination will be today.” T. P \n53 L 9-24, P 53 L 1-12. The history of prior notifications of public assembly for the \nStewart Mall was relevant to establishing Plaintiffs constitutional speech and \nassembly claims. \n58.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n14 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:486\n59.  ALJ Lombardo sustained an objection to Plaintiffs laying a foundation \nfor the notification of public assembly at issue in the hearing. T. P 69, L 9-18.  \n60.  This arbitrary sustaining of Defendants’ objection resulted in prejudice \nto the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n61.  ALJ Lombardo denied the admission of exhibits presented by Plaintiffs \nbased on Defendants’ objection as to relevancy. T. P 77, L 18. Plaintiffs’ proffered \nexhibits were photographs of the prior homeless tent encampment at the Stewart \nMall. Plaintiffs sought to enter the photographs into evidence for purposes of \nestablishing the public safety and accessibility of the Stewart Mall with a homeless \ntent encampment. T. P 74, L 5-18. Plaintiffs wanted the photographic evidence and \ntestimony related thereto entered into the record for purposes of appealing the \npermit denial on constitutional grounds. \n62.  This arbitrary denial of the admission of Plaintiffs’ exhibits resulted in \nprejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n63.  ALJ Lombardo denied Plaintiffs’ objection on grounds of relevancy to \nquestions on cross-examination of Plaintiff Thayer whether he had asked Chicago \nofficials, prior to submitting the notification for public assembly, if the City of \nChicago was willing to house 40 homeless people. Plaintiffs objected that \nnotification for a public assembly does not require other inquiries of city officials. T. \nP 97, L 16-24; P 98, L 1-19.  \n64.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n15 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:487\n65.  ALJ Lombardo overruled Plaintiffs’ objection to the relevancy of \nDefendants’ questions to Plaintiff Thayer in cross-examination as to the extent of \nhis contact with the homeless. Plaintiffs argued that the notification for public \nassembly was by an organization of the homeless and Thayer’s contacts with the \nhomeless was irrelevant. ALJ Lombardo overruled the objection based on the \nDefendants’ argument of developing the record as a defense for constitutional \narguments of Plaintiffs on appeal, even though the Plaintiffs were denied the same \nrequests for entering evidence and testimony into the record. See other errors \ndelineated above. T. P 101, L 13-24, P 102, L 1-19. \n66.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n67.  ALJ Lombardo overruled Plaintiffs’ objection based on relevancy to \nquestions regarding Plaintiff Thayer’s attitude toward the project to convert the \nStewart School into market rate housing. T. P117, L 3-24. ALJ Lombardo also \nallowed the follow up question to Plaintiff Thayer as to the location of the Stewart \nSchool in relation to the Stewart Mall, which left the prejudicial implication that \nthe notification for public assembly was a pretext to stop the Stewart School project. \nT. P 119, L 2-18. \n68.  This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to \nthe Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n69.  ALJ Lombardo permitted extensive testimony by Alisa Rodriquez, \nDeputy Commissioner for the homeless programs of the City of Chicago Department \n16 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:488\nof Family and Support Services, with respect to services and programs provided by \nthe City of Chicago for the homeless population as well as testimony on the number, \ncharacteristics and condition of the homeless population in Chicago. T. P 129-161. \nPrior to cross-examination of Ms. Rodriquez by Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs noted to ALJ \nLombardo that Plaintiffs “were not allowed the same scope of questioning [as \nconducted by Defendants of Ms. Rodriquez] when we were conducting our direct \nexamination of Mr. Thayer.” T. P 162, L 18-20. \n70.  ALJ Lombardo erred in not permitting the same scope of questioning \nMr. Thayer by Plaintiffs on direct examination as he allowed on the direct \nexamination of Ms. Rodriquez by Defendants. This arbitrary error resulted in \nprejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing. \n71.  ALJ Lombardo’s interpretation of “structure” to include tents is \narbitrary and capricious and has no basis in law or fact. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Enter an order reversing the decision of ALJ Lombardo, and granting \nPlaintiffs’ application for an assembly permit for the Stewart Mall for the location \nand manner as applied therefore, to run for a period of six months from the date of \nissuance; \nB.  Enter judgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in \nbringing this action; and \nC.  Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \n \n17 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 18 of 23 PageID #:489\nCount Two \nViolation of the Eighth Amendment \n72.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–71. \n73.  The lack of beds in shelters combined with the application of City \nordinances in a manner which prohibits homeless people from legally sleeping on \npublic land, results in the criminalization of homeless people based solely on their \nstatus as being homeless. The criminalizing of the status of homelessness, rather \nthan any conduct by the homeless, violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on \ncruel and unusual punishment. \n74.  On information and belief, the City of Chicago, acting through the \nChicago Police Department has consistently and regularly threatened to arrest the \nhomeless Plaintiffs in this action, or otherwise attempted to force them to move \ntheir tents and all other personal possessions, and in some instances have actually \nconfiscated their personal possessions, all without a lawful basis for doing so. Such \nactions of the police constitute policies of the City. \n75.  The City’s denial of the permit, coupled with the plan by the City and \nIDOT to reconstruct the Wilson and Lawrence bridges, without providing \nalternative housing for the Plaintiffs, who include individuals living under those \nbridges, violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual \npunishment, by criminalizing the status of homelessness. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.   Grant plaintiffs’ appeal to reverse the Department of Administrative \n18 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:490\nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of plaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly and grant said \nNotification of Public Assembly for the location and manner as applied therefore, to \nrun for a period of six months from the date of issuance; \nB.   Enter a declaration that MCC §10-8-320 and MCC §10-28-010 as \napplied to the Plaintiffs violates the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nC.   Enter a preliminary and then a permanent injunction barring \nDefendants from beginning repairs or otherwise taking action to evict the people \nliving under the Lake Shore Drive bridges over Lawrence and Wilson Avenues until \nalternate living arrangements are made for them; and barring Defendants and their \nagents, servants, employees and attorneys from applying MCC § 10-8-320 and MCC \n§ 10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from erecting tents as applied for \nin the Notification of Public Assembly; \nD.   Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants for \nmonetary damages to be determined at trial; \nE.   Enter judgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in \nbringing this action; and \nF.   Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \nCount Three \nViolation of the First Amendment  \n76.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–75. \n77.  Chicago Municipal Code sections 10-8-334 and 10-28-010 as applied to \n19 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:491\nPlaintiffs violate the First Amendment and constitute an unconstitutional express \nmunicipal policy of the Defendants. \n78.  As applied, these provisions unconstitutionally abridge the Plaintiffs’ \nright to free speech and assembly. \n79.  As applied, these provisions are not narrowly tailored to meet a \nsignificant governmental interest. \n80.  There are no ample alternatives channels for communication of the \nPlaintiffs message. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.   Grant Defendants’ appeal to reverse the Department of Administrative \nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of Defendants’ Notification of Public Assembly and grant \nsaid Notification of Public Assembly for the dates, location and manner as applied \ntherefore; \nB.   Enter a declaration that MCC § 10-8-320 and MCC § 10-28-010 as \napplied to the Plaintiffs violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nC.   Enter a preliminary and then a permanent injunction barring \nDefendants and their agents, servants, employees and attorneys from applying \nMCC § 10-8-320 and MCC § 10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from \nerecting tents as applied for in the Notification of Public Assembly; \nD.   Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants for \nmonetary damages to be determined at trial; \n20 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:492\nE.   Enter judgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in \nbringing this action; and \nF.   Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \nCount Four \nState Claim: Violation of the Illinois Homeless Act \n81.  Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations \nset forth in paragraphs 1–80. \n82.  The Illinois Homeless Act states in “Sec. 5. Legislative intent. It is the \nlong-standing policy of this State that no person should suffer unnecessarily from \ncold or hunger, be deprived of shelter or the basic rights incident to shelter, or be \nsubject to unfair discrimination based on his or her homeless status. At the present \ntime, many persons have been rendered homeless as a result of economic hardship, \na severe shortage of safe and affordable housing, and a shrinking social safety net. \nIt is the intent of this Act to lessen the adverse effects and conditions caused by the \nlack of residence or a home.” \n83.  The Illinois Homeless Act states that homelessness “means the status \nof having or not having a fixed or regular residence, including the status of living on \nthe streets, in a shelter, or in a temporary residence.” Illinois Homeless Act Sec. \n10(b). \n84.  The rights of the homeless pursuant to the Illinois Homeless Act \ninclude: \n  Sec. 10(a)(1): the right to use and move freely in public spaces, including but \nnot limited to public sidewalks, public parks, public transportation, and public \n21 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:493\nbuildings, in the same manner as any other person and without discrimination on \nthe basis of his or her housing status; and \nSec. 10(a)(7): the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her \npersonal property to the same extent as personal property in a permanent residence \n85.  The Defendants’ policies impede the ability of homeless Plaintiffs to \nmove freely in public spaces in violation of the Illinois Homeless Act. \n86.  The Defendants’ policies prohibit use of public spaces and violate the \nreasonable expectation of privacy of the homeless Plaintiffs in violation of the \nIllinois Homeless Act. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.   Grant Plaintiffs’ appeal to reverse the Department of Administrative \nHearings’ affirmation of the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of \nTransportation’s denial of Plaintiffs’ Notification of Public Assembly and grant said \nNotification of Public Assembly for the dates, location and manner as applied \ntherefore; \nB.   Enter a declaration that MCC § 10-8-320 and MCC § 10-28-010 as \napplied to the Plaintiffs violates the Illinois Homeless Act; \nC.   Enter a preliminary and then a permanent injunction barring \nDefendants and their agents, servants, employees and attorneys from applying \nMCC § 10-8-320 and MCC § 10-28-010 in a manner prohibiting Defendants from \nerecting tents as applied for in the Notification of Public Assembly; \nD.   Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants for \n22 \n\t\r  \n\nCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/01/17 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:494\nmonetary damages to be determined at trial; \nE.   Enter judgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in \nbringing this action; and \nF.   Grant Plaintiffs any and all other relief as law and justice demand. \n \nDated:  August 1, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Alan Mills_____________ \n \n/s/ Molly Armour_________ \n \n/s/ Jeffrey Frank__________ \n \n/s/ Adele D.
