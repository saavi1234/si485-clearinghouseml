          "description": "CLERKS NOTICE REGARDING CHANGE OF LOCATION FOR JUDGE GILLIAM:Effective March 2, 2017, Judge Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr.'s courtroom and chambers will be located in the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and United States Courthouse, Courtroom 2, 4th Floor, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA 94612. On or after March 2, 2017, all filings for matters pending on Judge Gilliam's docket, all court appearances, and all deliveries of chambers copies of documents must be made at the Oakland Courthouse. The days and times for law and motion calendars and all currently scheduled proceedings remain unchanged.Please note that all of Judge Gilliam's case files will be moved to the Oakland Courthouse; therefore, all case numbers assigned to him will be changed slightly to reflect the correct location. Previously, all case numbers started with 3 to indicate the San Francisco office (Example: 3:15-cv-1129-HSG). As of March 2, 2017 all of Judge Gilliam's case files will begin with 4 to indicate the Oakland office, but everything else will stay the same (Example: 4:15-cv-1129-HSG). When e-filing, using the short case number format will always avoid problems when searching for the correct case: 12-12345 (YY-NNNNN).For information on the Oakland Courthouse please go to: http://cand.uscourts.gov/locations-oakland (mclS, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 3/1/2017) (Entered: 03/01/2017)"

    "summary": "<p>On April 19, 2016, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit organization concerned with technology-related civil liberty issues, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the United States Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552. The case was assigned to Judge Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr.</p>\r\n<p>It was public knowledge that the government had attempted to compel third parties to assist in surveillance activities, such as when the FBI publicly demanded court orders requiring Apple to create a backdoor to the iPhone. The Electronic Frontier Foundation sought to learn about the government&rsquo;s efforts to obtain non-public court orders. The Foundation had filed a Freedom of Information Act request on March 7, 2016, seeking documents pertaining to requests for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to compel third parties to provide access to their customers&rsquo; encrypted communications or to provide other technical assistance in gaining access to private communications. When the Justice Department withheld the requested documents, the Foundation filed this lawsuit for an injunction requiring the Department to produce all such documents created between 1978 and June 1, 2015.</p>\r\n<p>In the fall of 2016, both parties moved for summary judgment. While these motions were pending, the Justice Department worked to process the original Freedom of Information Act request. A year later, after the parties acknowledged that the scope of their dispute would not be known until the document production process was complete, the court denied both summary judgment motions as moot on September 29, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2017, January 31, 2018, and August 22, 2018, the Justice Department released a total of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/J52Y-AQJK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73 documents</a>, out of 79 identified as responsive to the Foundation&rsquo;s request. The Department claimed that the remaining six documents, opinions written by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, were classified and exempt from disclosure.</p>\r\n<p>Both parties filed new motions for partial summary judgment in the fall of 2018. The Foundation argued that the Justice Department could not legally withhold the remaining documents: although the six documents were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, they were also subject to Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, which required the declassification of certain opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2019, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the Justice Department. 376 F.Supp.3d 1023. Although Section 402 might require the government to declassify the opinions, that statute created no private right of action to enforce the requirement. The court found that it would be inappropriate to use the Freedom of Information Act to enforce Section 402, and therefore declined to even address whether Section 402 actually required the government to declassify the opinions. It found that the Justice Department had provided sufficiently detailed factual information to support its exemption claims, and that the Foundation had failed to overcome the presumption of good faith to which the Department was entitled.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2019, the parties filed a joint status report, notifying the court that aside from attorneys&rsquo; fees, no dispute remained to be resolved. The parties submitted a proposed judgment in favor of the Justice Department as to its responses to the Foundations&rsquo;s requests. They also requested that the court order the parties to provide a status report, due by May 9, 2019, regarding their efforts to resolve the dispute over attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>Upon receipt of the status report on May 10, 2019, the court extended the deadline for notifying the court of the status of the parties&rsquo; efforts to finalize the agreement concerning attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs to June 10, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2019, the parties submitted a joint status report indicating that the parties finalized their agreement concerning attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs and have signed a settlement agreement. The parties jointly agreed to dismiss the case on July 3, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The DOJ contended that the remaining six documents were exempted from disclosure under FOIA exemptions.

Nos. 66, 68 \n \n12  Defendant. \na \ntr in  \nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Pending before the court is the motion for partial summary judgment filed by Defendant \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  U.S. Department of Justice, Dkt. No. 66, and the cross-motion for partial summary judgment filed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by Plaintiff Electronic Frontier Foundation (โEFFโ), Dkt. No. 68.  For the following reasons, the \nS d nr\nee 17  Court GRANTS Defendantโs motion and DENIES Plaintiffโs motion. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  I.  BACKGROUND \n19  On April 19, 2016, EFF filed this action under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ), \n20  5 U.S.C. ยง 552, seeking release of records concerning applications to the Federal Intelligence \n21  Surveillance Court (โFISCโ) and related opinions and orders.  Dkt. No. 1 (โCompl.โ) ยถ 1. \n22  According to the Complaint, FISC reviews applications from the government concerning \n23  national security surveillance.  Id. ยถ 7.  Historically, FISC opinions and appellate decisions by the \n24  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (โFISCRโ) were ex parte and classified.  Id. \n25  ยถ 8.  However, the USA FREEDOM Act, which was passed in the wake of the September 11th, \n26  2001 terrorist attacks, required a declassification review of โsignificantโ FISC and FISCR \n27  decisions.  Id. ยถยถ 9โ12.  Plaintiff alleges that recently the government has been using court orders \n28  to pressure private companies to provide access to encrypted communications, as was allegedly \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 2 of 18\n \n1  done following the San Bernardino shootings.  Id. ยถยถ 14โ18.  Through this FOIA action, Plaintiff \n2  โseeks to inform the public about the extent to which the government has used FISA and the FISC \n3  to compel private companies into providing assistance that would undermine the safety and \n4  security of millions of people who rely on software and the devices that run them, such as the \n5  iPhone, every day.โ  Id. ยถ 19. \n6  Currently at issue is one FOIA request:  a request for all decisions, orders, or opinions \n7  issued by FISC or FISCR between 1978 and June 1, 2015, that include a significant construction \n8  or interpretation of any law, including a significant construction of a โspecific selection termโ \n9  under the USA FREEDOM Act.  See id. ยถ 31; Dkt. No. 68 at 3.  The government identified \n10  seventy-nine (79) responsive FISC opinions, and eventually agreed to release seventy-three (73) of \n11  those opinions, in full or in part.  Dkt. No. 68 at 3โ4.  The remaining six opinions are the subject \n12  of these cross motions for summary judgment.  The government contends that these six documents \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  are exempted from disclosure under FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), and 7(E).  Dkt. No. 66 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  at 1.  Plaintiff argues that the USA FREEDOM Act requires the government to conduct a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  declassification review and either declassify and release the six opinions, or create an unclassified \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  summary of each of the opinions.  Dkt. No. 68 at 2.  Plaintiff contends that because the \nS d nr\nee 17  government has not complied with the declassification requirements, it has failed to meet its \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  burden under FOIA to withhold the six documents.  Id. at 7.  Plaintiff articulates a single claim for \n19  relief:  violation of FOIA for wrongful withholding of the six undisclosed agency records.  Compl. \n20  ยถยถ 38-41.       \n21  II.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \n22  Summary judgment is proper when a โmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \n23  any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \n24  A fact is โmaterialโ if it โmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.โ  Anderson \n25  v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute is โgenuineโ if there is evidence in the \n26  record sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving party.  Id.  The \n27  Court views the inferences reasonably drawn from the materials in the record in the light most \n28  favorable to the nonmoving party, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. \n2 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 3 of 18\n \n1  574, 587โ88 (1986), and โmay not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations,โ \n2  Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997), overruled on other grounds by Shakur v. \n3  Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 884โ85 (9th Cir. 2008).  If a court finds that there is no genuine dispute of \n4  material fact as to only a single claim or defense or as to part of a claim or defense, it may enter \n5  partial summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   \n6  With respect to summary judgment procedure, the moving party bears both the ultimate \n7  burden of persuasion and the initial burden of producing those portions of the pleadings, \n8  discovery, and affidavits that show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. \n9  v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Where the moving party will not bear the burden of proof on \n10  an issue at trial, it โmust either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving \n11  partyโs claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an \n12  essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.โ  Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000).  Where the moving party will bear the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  burden of proof on an issue at trial, it must also show that no reasonable trier of fact could not find \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in its favor.  Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325.  In either case, the movant โmay not require the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  nonmoving party to produce evidence supporting its claim or defense simply by saying that the \nS d nr\nee 17  nonmoving party has no such evidence.โ  Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 210 F.3d at 1105.  โIf a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, the nonmoving party has no obligation \n19  to produce anything, even if the nonmoving party would have the ultimate burden of persuasion at \n20  trial.โ  Id. at 1102โ03.   \n21  โIf, however, a moving party carries its burden of production, the nonmoving party must \n22  produce evidence to support its claim or defense.โ  Id. at 1103.  In doing so, the nonmoving party \n23  โmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.โ  \n24  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 586.  A nonmoving party must also โidentify with \n25  reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes summary judgment.โ  Keenan v. Allan, 91 \n26  F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996).  If a nonmoving party fails to produce evidence that supports its \n27  claim or defense, courts enter summary judgment in favor of the movant.  Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. \n28  at 323. \n3 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 4 of 18\n \nA.  FOIA \n1 \nFOIA, codified as 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, โwas enacted to facilitate public access to Government \n2 \ndocuments.โ  Lahr v. Natโl Transp. Safety Bd., 569 F.3d 964, 973 (9th Cir. 2009) (quotations \n3 \nomitted).  The goal of FOIA is to โensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a \n4 \ndemocratic society, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to \n5 \nthe governed.โ  Id.  (quotations omitted).  At the same time, FOIA contemplates that the \n6 \ngovernment may have legitimate reasons for withholding some information from the public.  Id.  \n7 \nAccordingly, FOIA โrequires federal agencies to make Government records available to the \n8 \npublic, subject to nine exemptions for specific categories of material.โ  Milner v. Depโt of Navy, \n9 \n562 U.S. 562, 564 (2011).  These nine FOIA exemptions are โexplicitly made exclusive and must \n10 \nbe narrowly construed.โ  Id. at 565 (quotation omitted). \n11 \nA defendant agency โmust show that its search for responsive records was adequate, that \n12 \na \ntr in any claimed exemptions actually apply, and that any reasonably segregable, non-exempt parts of \nuoro 13 \nC tfila records have been disclosed after redaction of exempt information.โ  Light v. Depโt of Justice, 968 \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo F. Supp. 2d 11, 23 (D.D.C. 2013); accord Lahr, 569 F.3d at 973; Pac. Fisheries, Inc. v. United \niD tc 15 \n sir States, 539 F.3d 1143, 1148 (9th Cir. 2008).  The agency bears the burden to show that it has \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr complied with its obligations under FOIA.  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  โ[G]overnment agencies \nee 17 \nth\nintr seeking to withhold documents requested under the FOIA have been required to supply the \nUo\nN 18 \nopposing party and the court with a โVaughn index,โ identifying each document withheld, the \n19 \nstatutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure of the particular \n20 \ndocument would damage the interest protected by the claimed exemption.  The purpose of the \n21 \nindex is to afford the FOIA requester a meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an \n22 \nadequate foundation to review, the soundness of the withholding.โ  Wiener v. F.B.I., 943 F.2d 972, \n23 \n977โ78 (9th Cir. 1991) (citations and quotations omitted). \n24 \nFOIA cases are typically decided on motions for summary judgment because the facts are \n25 \nrarely in dispute.  See Minier v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 88 F.3d 796, 800 (9th Cir. 1996).  On a \n26 \nmotion for summary judgment, a district court analyzes the withholding of documents de novo.  5 \n27 \nU.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  FOIA permits a district court to enjoin a defendant agency from \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 5 of 18\n \n1  withholding agency records or to order a defendant agency to produce any improperly withheld \n2  records.  Id. \n3  B.  USA FREEDOM Act \n4  The USA FREEDOM Act was signed into law on June 2, 2015.

H.R. \n7  Rep. No. 114-109, at 6 (2015).  Relevant here, Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act (โSection \n8  402โ), codified as 50 U.S.C.A. ยง 1872, requires conditional declassification of certain FISC and \n9  FISCR opinions: \n \n10  Declassification Required.--Subject to subsection (b), the  Director of \nNational Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall \n11  conduct a declassification review of each decision,  order, or opinion \nissued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  or the Foreign \na  12  Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (as defined in section \ntr in 601(e)) that includes a significant construction or interpretation of any \nuoro 13  provision of law, including any novel or significant construction or \nCfi\n tla interpretation of the term `specific selection term', and, consistent \nciC 14  with  that  review,  make  publicly  available  to  the  greatest  extent \nrts fo practicable each such decision, order, or opinion. \niD tc 15 \n sir Pub.

L. No. 114-23, ยง 402(c) (2015); 50 U.S.C. ยง 1872(c). \n2 \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n3 \nThe pivotal issue here is whether Section 402 bars Defendant from relying on FOIA \n4 \nExemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the six FISC opinions, because, as Plaintiff alleges, there is no \n5 \nevidence that a declassification review was conducted, as required by Section 402.  Dkt. No. 68 at \n6 \n7.  Put another way, the Court must decide whether it can essentially enforce the declassification \n7 \nmandate under Section 402 through a FOIA action.  This may include determining whether the \n8 \nUSA FREEDOM Act applies retroactively.  See Dkt. No. 66 at 19โ25; Dkt. No. 68 at 11โ14.  If \n9 \nSection 402 does not prevent the government from relying on the FOIA exemptions, then the \n10 \ninquiry is whether the government properly withheld the six opinions and whether the Vaughn \n11 \nindex it provided was sufficient to satisfy FOIA requirements.   \n12 \na \ntr in A.  FOIA AND THE FREEDOM ACT \nuoro 13 \nC tfila The parties agree that Section 402 creates no private cause of action to enforce the \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo declassification of FISC opinions.  See Dkt. No. 66 at 16; Dkt. No. 70 at 4.  Plaintiff contends that \niD tc 15 \n sir because the government did not submit evidence that it has performed the declassification review \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr required by Section 402, then either (1) the six opinions are improperly classified and not subject \nee 17 \nth\nintr to withholding under FOIA Exemptions 1 or 3, or (2) the Vaughn index provided by the \nUo\nN 18 \ngovernment is inadequate to serve as a โdeclassification summary,โ because it does not provide \n19 \nthe information required in Section 402.  See 50 U.S.C.A. ยง 1872(c)(2)(A) (stating that summary \n20 \nโshall include, to the extent consistent with national security, a description of the context in which \n21 \nthe matter arises and any significant construction or interpretation of any statute, constitutional \n22 \nprovision, or other legal authority relied on by the decision.โ).     \n23 \nAlthough Plaintiff presents a creative argument, the Court agrees with Defendant that \n24 \nPlaintiff cannot enforce Section 402 through this FOIA action.  See Dkt. No. 69 at 2.  While courts \n25 \nhave not addressed this specific issue, the Court is persuaded by the decisions of courts \n26 \ninterpreting FOIAโs relationship with other disclosure statutes.  See, e.g., Minier, 88 F.3d at 799.   \n27 \nIn Minier, plaintiff sought disclosure from the Central Intelligence Agency (โCIAโ) under \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 7 of 18\n \n1  FOIA of information regarding a potential CIA agentโs alleged involvement in President John F. \n2  Kennedyโs assassination.  88 F.3d at 799.  The CIA denied plaintiffโs request under FOIA \n3  Exemptions 1 and 3.  Id. at 800.  The plaintiff did not contest the applicability of the exemptions, \n4  but instead attempted to circumvent them by arguing that the President John F. Kennedy \n5  Assassination Records Collection Extension Act of 1994 (the โJFK Actโ) mandated disclosure of \n6  the requested information under FOIA.  Id. at 802.  The JFK Act provides that โall Government \n7  records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of \n8  immediate disclosure.โ  Id. (citing JFK Act ยง 2(a)(2)).  Congressโs enactment of the JFK Act in \n9  part was a response to FOIA โprevent[ing] the timely disclosure of records relating to the \n10  assassination of President John F. Kennedy.โ  Id. (citing JFK Act ยง 2(a)(5)).    \n11  The Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffโs argument (and noted that the D.C. Circuit and \n12  First Circuit rejected similar arguments), reasoning that the JFK Act explicitly provided that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  โ[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to eliminate or limit any right to file requests ... or seek \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  judicial review of the decisions pursuant to [FOIA].โ  Id. (citing JFK Act ยง 11(b)) (brackets in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  original).  โHad Congress intended the JFK Act to alter the procedure for reviewing FOIA \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  requests, presumably it would have expressly said so.โ  Id.; see also Assassination Archives and \nS d nr\nee 17  Research Center v. Department of Justice, 43 F.3d 1542, 1544 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (โThere is no \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  evidence that Congress intended that the JFK Act standards be applied to FOIA review of \n19  documents involving the Kennedy assassination.โ).  Therefore, even though it was โundoubtedly \n20  true that the JFK Act was motivated by less than adequate FOIA responses to Kennedy \n21  assassination record requests,โ the purpose was to require agencies to release information relating \n22  to the Kennedy assassination, not to override the ability of the government to claim proper FOIA \n23  exemptions.  Minier, 88 F.3d at 802; see also Assassination Archives, 43 F.3d at 1544 (โCongress \n24  evidently hoped that prompt administrative application of the Actโs broader criteria for release \n25  would moot considerable FOIA litigation and would benefit those FOIA requesters who had long \n26  sought access to assassination records.โ). \n27  While the USA FREEDOM Act does not explicitly refer to FOIA, the JFK Act is similar in \n28  that it mandates disclosure of records that the FOIA exemptions may protect from disclosure.  See \n7 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 8 of 18\n \n1  JFK Act ยง 2(a)(2) (requiring disclosure of records concerning the assassination of President John \n2  F. Kennedy); 50 U.S.C.A. ยง 1872(a) (requiring disclosure of FISC opinions that are declassified).  \n3  Both statutes also have their own mechanism for review:  under the JFK Act, the Assassination \n4  Records Review Board evaluates the documents to determine whether they qualify as \n5  assassination records, see Assassination Archives, 43 F.3d at 1543, and under the USA \n6  FREEDOM Act, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, \n7  conducts a declassification review to determine if FISC documents were properly classified.  50 \n8  U.S.C. ยง 1872.  Absent clear evidence that Congress intended Section 402 to be applied when \n9  reviewing FOIA exemptions, the Court will not impute such an intent to hybridize two statutory \n10  schemes.  See Assassination Archives, 43 F.3d at 1544 (โWe thus find no statutory warrant for \n11  creating a private right of action to enforce the JFK Act, either directly by implying such a cause \n12  of action, or through the subterfuge of judicially hybridizing the two acts.โ).  The purpose of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Section 402 was to allow for more transparency of FISC and FISCR opinions by requiring the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to release information that they \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  determined were not classified, not to override โthe ability of the government to claim proper \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  FOIA exemptions.โ  See Minier, 88 F.3d at 802 \nS d nr\nee 17    The Court is also persuaded by Defendantโs argument that Plaintiffโs theory would \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  require the Court to mandate a remedy that lies outside of FOIA.  Dkt. No. 69 at 5.  Although \n19  Plaintiff contends it is only requesting that the Court โinterpret Section 402, not enforce it,โ Dkt. \n20  No. 70 at 3, Plaintiff plainly seeks to enforce Section 402โs requirements.  If the Court finds that \n21  the USA FREEDOM Act imposes additional requirements that Defendant failed to satisfy when \n22  claiming FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, then according to Plaintiff, Defendant must either release the \n23  opinions, or include unclassified summaries as part of its Vaughn Index to reasonably justify \n24  withholding them.  Dkt. No. 70 at 7.  Assuming there is no dispute as to whether these six \n25  opinions were properly classified, Plaintiff would have the Defendant provide the unclassified \n26  summaries as part of its Vaughn index.  Dkt. No. 68 at 17.  But the content of the unclassified \n27  summaries is different than what is required under FOIA.  Under FOIA, a Vaughn index requires \n28  the government to โidentify[] each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a \n8 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 9 of 18\n \n1  particularized explanation of how disclosure of the particular document would damage the interest \n2  protected by the claimed exemption.โ  See Freedom of the Press Found. v. United States Depโt of \n3  Justice, 241 F. Supp. 3d 986, 996โ97 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (quotations omitted).  The unclassified \n4  summaries, by contrast, require a statement by the Attorney General that summarizes the actual \n5  construction or interpretation of any law and a description of the context, which are not required \n6  under FOIA.  See 50 U.S.C. ยง 1872(c).  The Court agrees with Defendant that using FOIA to \n7  enforce Section 402 would require the Court to impose remedies outside of FOIAโs requirements.  \n8  Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 152 (โThe [FOIA] Act \n9  does not obligate agencies to create or retain documents; it only obligates them to provide access \n10  to those which it in fact has created and retained.โ). \n11  Plaintiff relies on two cases for its proposition that the Court may interpret the USA \n12  FREEDOM Act to determine whether information is properly withheld under FOIA.  See Dkt. No. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  68 at 8 (citing Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011) and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Long v. U.S. I.R.S., 742 F.2d 1173 (9th Cir. 1984)).  Both cases involve interpretation of a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  statutory or executive order authority proffered by the government as justification for FOIA \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  withholding.  These cases are distinguishable from this action.  In Long, the statue at issue, section \nS d nr\nee 17  6103 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act (โERTAโ), was a nondisclosure statute amended for the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  specific purpose of targeting two previous FOIA cases that sought disclosure of the same \n19  documents.  742 F.2d at 1176 (โIt is clear from the legislative history of the amendment that \n20  Congress was targeting these [two previous FOIA cases].โ).  The Ninth Circuit held that section \n21  6103 qualified as an exemption statue under FOIA Exemption 3, because Exemption 3 was \n22  โdesigned to give effect to just such explicit nondisclosure statutes as section 6103.โ  Id. at 1178.  \n23  The Long court also found it persuasive that section 6110, another section in the ERTA, had its \n24  own set of procedures for disclosure requests, indicating that Congress intended section 6110 to be \n25  excluded from FOIA.  Id.  Section 6110 was, like the JFK Act and Section 402, a disclosure \n26  provision rather than a nondisclosure provision.  See 26 U.S.C. ยง 6110(a) (โExcept as otherwise \n27  provided in this section, the text of any written determination and any background file document \n28  relating to such written determination shall be open to public inspection at such place as the \n9 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 10 of 18\n \n1  Secretary may by regulations prescribe.โ).  The Long court found that the absence of similar \n2  procedures in section 6103 reflected Congressโs intent that section 6103 would fall within the \n3  FOIA regime.  742 F.2d at 1178.  In contrast, this action concerns the opposite situation:  Plaintiff \n4  seeks the disclosure of documents under Section 402 despite FOIA exemptions protecting them \n5  from disclosure.  The Court finds that Section 402 is more similar to the disclosure statute of \n6  section 6110 of ERTA than to section 6103.1 \n7  Accordingly, the Court finds that it does not have the authority to engraft Section 402โs \n8  declassification mandate in evaluating whether Defendant has properly asserted FOIA exemptions.  \n9  As such, the Court does not need to address the issue of whether Section 402 applies \n10  retroactively.2   \n11  B.  FOIA EXEMPTIONS \n12  Having reached the conclusion that Section 402 does not impose additional requirements \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  in a FOIA action, the Court now turns to whether the government properly withheld the six \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  documents under FOIA exemptions.  To properly withhold the documents, the government bears \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the burden of showing that โits search for responsive records was adequate, that any claimed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  exemptions actually apply, and that any reasonably segregable, non-exempt parts of records have \nS d nr\nee 17  been disclosed after redaction of exempt information.โ  Light, 968 F. Supp. 2d 11 at 23.  Plaintiff \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  does not challenge the adequacy of the governmentโs search, but does dispute whether the \n19  government has demonstrated the latter two requirements.  See Dkt. No. 66 at 4.   \n20   โFOIAโs strong presumption in favor of disclosure places the burden on the government to \n21  show that an exemption properly applies to the records it seeks to withhold.โ  Hamdan v. U.S. \n22  Depโt of Justice, 797 F.3d 759, 772 (9th Cir. 2015).  When a government agency seeks to withhold \n23 \n                                                 \n1 ACLU is similarly distinguishable.  In ACLU, the D.C. Circuit held that it was proper for the \n24 \ngovernment to interpret executive orders to determine the classification of certain documents, \nsince that is exactly what FOIA Exemption 1 requires the government to do.  628 F.3d at 619โ25; \n25 \nsee 5 U.S.C. ยง 522(b)(1) (preventing disclosure of documents โspecifically authorized under \ncriteria established by an Executive order to be kept secretโ). \n26 \n2 Although the Court need not address this issue, the Court notes that a district court in the District \nof Columbia has held that Section 402 does not apply retroactively.  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. \n27 \nDepโt of Justice, 296 F. Supp. 3d 109, 127 (D.D.C. 2017) (โWhat is more, the FREEDOM ACT \nwas enacted in June 2015โwell after the reports at issue here were createdโand there is nothing \n28 \nto indicate that Congress intended the statute to apply retroactively to prior FISC decisions.โ) \n10 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 11 of 18\n \n1  documents under FOIA exemptions, courts have required the agency โto supply the opposing \n2  party and the court with a Vaughn index, identifying each document withheld, the statutory \n3  exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure of the particular document \n4  would damage the interest protected by the claimed exemption.โ  Wiener, 943 F.2d at 977.  The \n5  purpose of a Vaughn index and any accompanying affidavits is to โafford the FOIA requester a \n6  meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an adequate foundation to review, the \n7  soundness of the withholding,โ and thus partially restore the adversary process to judicial review \n8  of the agencyโs decision.  Id. at 977โ78.  โSpecificity is the defining requirement of the Vaughn \n9  index.โ  Id. at 979. \n10   โWhere the government invokes FOIA exemptions in cases involving national security \n11  issues, [courts] are required to accord substantial weight to the agencyโs affidavits.โ  Hamdan, 797 \n12  F.3d at 769 (quotations omitted).  A court must be mindful of its โlimited institutional expertise on \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  intelligence matters, as compared with the executive branch.โ  Id. at 770.  However, the affidavits \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  still โmust describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemptions, and show \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that the justifications are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of \nS d nr\nee 17  agency bad faith.โ  Id. at 769 (quotations omitted).  โ[A]n agencyโs justification for invoking a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible.โ  Id. at 774 (quotations omitted).  \n19  โIf the affidavits contain reasonably detailed descriptions of the documents and allege facts \n20  sufficient to establish an exemption, the district court need look no further.โ  Lane v. Depโt of \n21  Interior, 523 F.3d 1128, 1135โ36 (9th Cir. 2008) (quotations omitted).   \n22  Here, Defendant is withholding the following six documents in their entirety under the \n23  following FOIA exemptions: \n \n24 \nDoc. #  Document Type  Exemption \n25  1  FISC Supplemental Order  1, 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(E) \n2  FISC Primary Order  1, 3, 6 \n26 \n3  FISC Amendment to Primary Order  1, 3, 6 \n4  FISC Primary Order  1, 3, 6 \n27 \n5  FISC Supplemental Opinion  1, 3, 6 \n28  6  FISC Order  1, 3 \n11 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 12 of 18\n \n1  Dkt.

The main \n3  thrust of Plaintiffโs arguments regarding Exemptions 1 and 3 is that Defendant did not comply \n4  with the USA FREEDOM Act, the same contention that the Court rejected above.  See Dkt. No. \n5  68 at 15 (โThe government cannot show that the Six Opinions have been properly classified to \n6  Exemption 1โs standard because they have not demonstrated that they have complied with USA \n7  FREEDOM Actโs declassification review requirements.โ); 16 (โWith respect to [Exemption 3 \n8  statutes,] USA FREEDOM, however, not only authorizes the Director of National Intelligence to \n9  disclose the records at issue here, but requires him to disclose them โto the greatest extent \n10  practicableโ or to certify that they cannot be disclosed and to create a declassified summary of \n11  them.โ)  The Court now addresses whether Defendant properly withheld the six documents under \n12  the FOIA exemptions.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  i.

Disclosure of these \n23  identities would alert these targets to take countermeasures to avoid surveillance and could also \n24  provide adversaries with valuable insight into the intelligence communityโs methods.  Id.  ยถยถ 27โ\n25  28.  Ms. Gaviria elaborates that the documents also include information that contain the specific \n26  type of communication and data collected by the intelligence community, its methods, and its \n27  limitations, disclosure of which would neutralize the intelligence communityโs core mission by \n28  allowing adversaries to identify and counteract those methods.  Id.  ยถยถ 30โ39.  The six documents \n13 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 14 of 18\n \n1  also contain identities of entities that aid the intelligence community under FISA orders; if \n2  disclosed, adversaries could avoid detection and the intelligence community could lose \n3  information crucial to the national security and defense of the United States.   Id.  ยถยถ 40โ44.  \n4  Finally, the withheld information includes docket numbers and dates, disclosure of which would \n5  allow adversaries to deduce when collection may or may not be occurring.  Id.  ยถยถ 45โ47.  The \n6  Gaviria Declaration concludes that the national security of the United States could be exposed to \n7  grave damage should the above information be disclosed.  Id.  ยถยถ 27โ47.  \n8  The Gaviria Declaration provides sufficient detail regarding the withheld information to \n9  make the Exemption 1 classification plausible.  See Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 770.  It does not attempt \n10  to categorize distinct information into a single general justification, but gives thorough \n11  explanations demonstrating how national security could be compromised if the information is \n12  disclosed.  Recognizing the Court's โlimited institutional expertise on intelligence matters,โ see \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 770, the Court accords substantial weight to Ms. Gaviriaโs representation \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that โdisclosure of this information could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage, and in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  some instances, exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.โ  See \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Gaviria Decl. ยถ 30.  In the area of national security, โit is conceivable that the mere explanation of \nS d nr\nee 17  why information must be withheld can convey valuable information to a foreign intelligence \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  agency.โ  See Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 775.  Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant properly \n19  withheld information under Exemption 1. \n20  ii.  Exemption 3 โ Information Protected by Statute \n21  Defendant contends that the same six documents withheld in full are properly withheld \n22  under Exemption 3.  Exemption 3 protects information: \n \n23  specifically exempted from disclosure by statute ... if that statute \n(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a \n24  manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes \nparticular  criteria  for  withholding  or  refer  to  particular  types  of \n25  matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date of enactment \nof the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to the paragraph. \n26 \n5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3): Berman v. C.I.A., 501 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2007).  In determining \n27 \nwhether information has been properly withheld under Exemption 3, the Court asks โwhether the \n28 \n14 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 15 of 18\n \n1  statute identified by the agency is a statute of exemption within the meaning of Exemption 3,โ and \n2  โwhether the withheld records satisfy the criteria of the exemption statute.โ  Hamdan, 797 F.3d at \n3  776. \n4  According to Defendant, the government properly withheld the six documents under two \n5  statutes: (1) Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Agency (โNSAโ) Act of 1947, codified as \n6  50 U.S.C. ยง 3024(i)(1), and (2) Section 6 of the NSA Act of 1959, codified as 50 U.S.C. ยง 3605. 4  \n7  Dkt. No. 66 at 10โ11.  Section 102A(i)(1) of the NSA Act of 1947 requires the Director of \n8  National Intelligence to โprotect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.โ  \n9  50 U.S.C. ยง 3024(i)(1).  Section 6 of the NSA Act of 1959 states that โnothing in this chapter or \n10  any other law [ ] shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or any function of \n11  the National Security Agency, or any information with respect to the activities thereof.โ  50 U.S.C. \n12  ยง 3605.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Court is similarly satisfied that the withheld records would disclose intelligence \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  sources, methods, and information about the function and activities of the NSA.  The detail \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  provided under Exemption 1 demonstrates that the government also properly withheld the six \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  opinions under Exemption 3.  Because each of the categories of information described in \nS d nr\nee 17  Exemption 1 relates to NSAโs intelligence gathering activities, that information falls within \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Section 102A(i)(1) and Section 6 of the NSA Acts and are properly withheld under Exemption 3.5   \n19  iii.  Segregability  \n20  FOIA requires that โ[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to \n21  any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this \n22  subsection.โ  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b).  โThe burden is on the agency to establish that all reasonably \n23  segregable portions of a document have been segregated and disclosed.โ Pac. Fisheries, 539 F.3d \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4 Plaintiff does not contest that either of these laws is a statute of exemption within the meaning of \nExemption 3, but rather alleges that the USA FREEDOM Act controls and mandates disclosure.  \n26 \nDkt. No. 68 at 16.  For the reasons already discussed, the Court disagrees. \n5 The Court need not address the applicability of Exemptions 7(A) and 7(E), because it has found \n27 \nthat Defendant properly withheld the six documents in full under Exemptions 1 and 3.  Plaintiffโs \ncursory briefing also suggests that the applicability of these exemptions is not a pivotal issue here.  \n28 \nSee Dkt. No. 68 at 17 n.8.  \n15 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 16 of 18\n \n1  at 1148.  Nevertheless, the agency is also โentitled to a presumption that [it] complied with the \n2  obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.โ  Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d \n3  1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  Similarly, the Court โmay rely on an agencyโs declaration in making \n4  its segregability determination.  Agency affidavits that are sufficiently detailed are presumed to be \n5  made in good faith and may be taken at face value.โ  Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 779.  The Court โneed \n6  not conduct a page-by-page review of an agencyโs work.โ  Id. \n7  The Court finds that Defendant has met its burden through its tailored explanations of the \n8  withheld documents.  The Gaviria Declaration states that these six documents were โreviewed by \n9  multiple agencies initially as part of either the second or third batch of documents released in this \n10  case in September 2017 and January 2018,โ demonstrating that Defendant conducted several \n11  reviews of the documents in question.  Gaviria Decl. ยถ 54.  Ms. Gaviria represents that the \n12  multiple agencies, in preparing for Defendantโs motion for partial summary judgment, reviewed \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the documents โline by line,โ demonstrating that there was an extensive and thorough review \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  process.  Id. ยถ 55.  Defendant also provided a description as to why it withheld particular \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  documents and how information could be deduced if certain information was redacted instead of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  fully withheld.  Id. ยถ 56.   \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffโs only argument in response is to compare Defendantโs actions here with previous \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  cases that Defendant was involved in.  Dkt. No. 68 at 22โ23.  The Court is not persuaded.  For \n19  one, the procedural history here indicates that Defendant has gone back to re-evaluate previously \n20  withheld FISC opinions and released part of those documents in good faith.  Dkt. No. 68 at 3โ4.  \n21  Plaintiff asks the Court to make an inference about Defendantโs current actions based on a \n22  different set of circumstances, but Plaintiffโs speculative suggestion is not enough to overcome the \n23  presumption of good faith. Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 779.  The Court thus finds that Defendant has \n24  adequately shown that it โproperly withheld and segregatedโ the documents in question.  See \n25  Freedom of the Press, 241 F. Supp. 3d at 1004.   \n26  iv.  Vaughn Index \n27  In a FOIA action, because only the withholding party will have access to all the facts, \n28  district courts have required that the withholding party supply the court and opposing counsel a \n16 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 17 of 18\n \n1  โVaughnโ index, โidentifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a \n2  particularized explanation of how disclosure of the particular document would damage the interest \n3  protected by the claimed exemptions.โ  Wiener, 943 F.2d at 977.  Defendant submitted a chart \n4  listing the six withheld documents with the type of FISC order or opinion, the number of pages, \n5  the exemptions, and confirmation that each document was entirely withheld.  Dkt. No. 69 at 18.  \n6  This chart is meant to be read in conjunction with the Gaviria Declaration and the Hardy \n7  Declaration.6  See Dkt. No. 66-1.  Plaintiff contends that Defendantโs Vaughn index is deficient, \n8  even apart from Section 402โs requirements.  Dkt. No. 68 at 19โ20.     \n9  The Court finds that the Vaughn index is adequate.  The substance of the Declarations was \n10  detailed and specific, unlike the index that the Ninth Circuit found deficient in Wiener.  Compare \n11  943 F.2d at 978โ79 (finding โboilerplateโ explanations and categorical descriptions, such as \n12  โInformation of this category is either specific in nature or of a unique character, and thereby \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  could lead to the identification of a source,โ inadequate for Vaughn index), with Gaviria Decl. ยถ 41 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (โConfirming or denying a relationship between a specific Intelligence Community element and a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  specific entity that is required by FISA order to provide assistance to the Government would \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reveal to foreign adversaries whether or not that Intelligence Community utilizes particular \nS d nr\nee 17  intelligence sources and methods and [ ] would compromise actual sources and methods.โ), and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Hardy Decl. ยถ 14 (โI can state that Document 1 contains fairly detailed, non-public descriptions of \n19  the specific target of a national security investigation, facilities the target was using, and specific \n20  sensitive techniques used by the target โฆ disclosure of [certain statutory] language would tend to \n21  disclose both the type of target subject to the surveillance as well as the nature of the \n22  surveillanceโ).  Unlike the affidavits in Wiener, the Gaviria and Hardy Declarations do not include \n23  boilerplate or categorical descriptions but instead provide sufficient detail for the Court to \n24  adequately review the โsoundness of the withholding.โ  See at 943 F.2d at 977.    \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n6 All references to the โHardy Decl.โ or โHardy Declarationโ are to the Declaration of David M. \n27 \nHardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Information Management \nDivision, attached as Exhibit B to Defendantโs motion for partial summary judgment, filed on July \n28 \n26, 2018.  See Dkt. No. 66-1. \n17 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 74   Filed 03/26/19   Page 18 of 18\n \nv.  In Camera Review \n1 \nThe Court may review documents in camera to determine whether exemptions have been \n2 \nproperly asserted.  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  In camera inspection, however, should โnot be \n3 \nresorted to lightly,โ Lewis v. IRS, 823 F.2d 375, 378 (9th Cir. 1987), and is โdisfavoredโ where \n4 \nโthe government sustains its burden of proof by way of its testimony or affidavits.โ  Lion Raisins \n5 \nv. Depโt of Agric., 354 F.3d 1072, 1079 (9th Cir. 2004).  โIn camera inspection is particularly a \n6 \nlast resort in national security situations like this caseโa court should not resort to it routinely on \n7 \nthe theory that it canโt hurt.โ  ACLU v. Depโt of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 626 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  The \n8 \nCourt finds that in camera review is unnecessary here as Defendant already provided sufficiently \n9 \ndetailed factual information in support of its exemptions in the Gaviria and Hardy Declarations.  \n10 \nAs discussed, Plaintiff has failed to overcome the good faith presumption to which the \n11 \ndeclarations are entitled.  Hamdan, 797 F.3d at 770. \n12 \na \ntr in IV.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) reviews applications from the \n18 \ngovernment concerning national security surveillance. Since its creation in the 1970s, the FISCโs \n19 \nrole has gradually expanded. Where the court focused initially on granting applications to conduct \n20 \nsurveillance  on  particular  targets,  it  is  now  increasingly  asked  to  decide  the  legality,  and \n21 \nconstitutionality, of entire programs of government surveillance.  \n22 \n8.  In the past, the FISC typically considered government applications ex parte, and its \n23 \nopinions and orders were, almost without exception, classified. Appellate rulings on the FISCโs \n24 \ndecisions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) are similarly classified. \n \n25 \nAs the effect of the FISC and FISCRโs decisions expanded, the ex parte and classified nature of their \n26 \nopinions proved increasingly problematic: the public was prevented from understanding how these \n27 \nfederal courts were interpreting surveillance laws and the Constitution, often in ways that implicated \n28 \n    -2-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 3 of 8\n \n1 \ncitizensโ rights.  \n2 \n9.  After  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  the  FISC  and  FISCR  were \n3 \nincreasingly called upon to decide significant or novel questions of federal or constitutional lawโin \n4 \nsecret. This resulted in the creation of a vast body of secret federal surveillance law.  \n5 \n10.  The tension between our democratic traditions of openness and access to the courts \n6 \nand the growing body of secret surveillance law culminated in the Guardian newspaper disclosing a \n7 \nthen-classified order of the FISC in June 2013. The disclosure touched off a years-long debate about \n8 \nthe nature, scope, and propriety of our nationโs national security surveillance laws.   \n9 \n11.  That debate spurred the passage, in June 2015, of the USA FREEDOM Act, Pub. L. \n10 \n114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (June 2, 2015) (โUSA Freedomโ), which implemented a series of national \n11 \nsecurity surveillance reforms. \n12 \n12.  One  aspect  of  USA  Freedomโs  reforms  included  the  required  declassification  of \n13 \nโsignificantโ FISC and FISCR decisions. Specifically, Section 402(a) of USA Freedom states that: \n14  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  in  consultation  with  the  Attorney \nGeneral, shall conduct a declassification review of each decision, order, or \n15  opinion issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review (as defined in section 601(e)) \n  16  that includes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of \nlaw, including any novel or significant construction or interpretation of the \n17  term  โspecific  selection  termโ,  and,  consistent  with  that  review,  make \npublicly  available  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  each  such  decision, \n18  order, or opinion. \n19  13.  Both before and since enactment of the USA Freedom, Plaintiff EFF has endeavored \n20  to inform the public about the FISCโs role in national security surveillance by requesting, through \n21  FOIA, certain FISC opinions and orders. \n22  U.S. Government Seeks Court Orders to Compel Access to Encrypted Communications  \n23  14.  As the public debated national security surveillance reform, the government quietly \n24  began  increasing  pressure  on  companies  to  provide  access  to  encrypted  communications  or  to \n \n25  provide other types of technical assistance to access private communications. \n26  15.  For example, one news report indicated that the government had considered taking \n27  Apple, Inc. (โApple\") to court after the Department of Justice obtained a court order requiring the \n28  company to provide real-time access to its customersโ encrypted iMessages. Apple represented it \n    -3-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 4 of 8\n \n1 \nwas  unable  to  comply  with  an  order  it  had  received  because  it  could  not  decrypt  the \n2 \ncommunications.

Then, in February, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) obtained a court order \n5 \nrequiring Apple to write software and digitally sign it so that the FBI could defeat built-in security \n6 \nmeasures on an iPhone. Apple contested the order. Eric Lichtblau & Katie Benner, Apple Fights \n7 \nOrder to Unlock San Bernardino Gunmanโs iPhone, The New York Times (Feb. 17, 2016). \n8 \n17.  Although the examples described in Paragraphs 16 and 17 occurred in traditional \n9 \nfederal courts, the FISC also has jurisdiction to consider compelled technical assistance. The Foreign \n10 \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (โFISAโ), 50 U.S.C. ch. 36, allows the government to seek technical \n11 \nassistance from third parties with respect to any application it seeks or order or opinion it receives \n12 \nfrom the FISC. See, e.g., 50 U.S.C. ยง 1805(c)(2)(B).  \n13 \n18.  News outlets have reported that the government has sought FISC orders and opinions \n14 \nthat required private companies to turn over their source code so that the government can identify \n15 \nand  exploit  vulnerabilities  for  its  own  surveillance  purposes.  Zack  Whittaker,  US  Government \n16 \n  Pushed Tech Firms to Hand Over Source Code, ZDNet (March 17, 2016).  \n17 \n19.  Plaintiff EFF seeks to inform the public about the extent to which the government has \n18 \nused  FISA  and  the  FISC  to  compel  private  companies  into  providing  assistance  that  would \n19 \nundermine the safety and security of millions of people who rely on software and the devices that \n20 \nrun them, such as the iPhone, every day. \n21 \nPlaintiffโs FOIA Requests \n22 \nPlaintiffโs FOIA for FISC orders requiring technical assistance of third parties \n23 \n20.  In a letter dated October 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed a FOIA request with the National \n24 \nSecurity Division of Defendant DOJ (Oct. 8 FOIA). The request sought: \n \n25 \nโข Any applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (โFISCโ) \nthat included requests for technical assistance under the Foreign Intelligence \n26 \nSurveillance Act (โFISAโ), 50 U.S.C. ch. 36. \n \n27 \nโข Any written FISC opinions or orders regarding any applications submitted \nto the court that included requests for technical assistance under FISA.  \n28 \n    -4-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 5 of 8\n \n \n1 \nโข Any related briefing or correspondence with the FISC, its staff, or any \nthird  party  (including  but  not  limited  to  Apple,  Inc.  and  its  attorneys) \n2 \nconcerning applications submitted to the court that included requests for \ntechnical assistance under FISA. \n3 \n21.  In the Oct. 8 FOIA, Plaintiff also sought expedited processing of its request as well as \n4 \nthe media fee waiver and public interest fee waiver.  \n5 \n22.  On November 23, 2015, Defendant acknowledged Plaintiffโs Oct. 8 FOIA request via \n6 \ne-mail and granted its requests for expedited processing and fee waivers.  \n7 \n23.  On December 16, 2015, Defendant provided its final response to the Oct. 8 FOIA via \n8 \nletter. In DOJโs final response, Defendant stated โwe understand your request to be limited to \n9 \napplications,  orders,  and  related  briefs  and  correspondence  specifically  concerning  requests  for \n10 \ntechnical assistance ordering the decryption of, or assistance in decrypting, encrypted electronic \n11 \ncommunications.โ  \n12 \n24.  Defendant further stated:  \n13 \nWe have processed your request and identified no responsive applications \n14  to the FISC. Relatedly, we have also not identified any FISC opinions, FISC \norders, or briefing regarding such applications. We have identified two \n15  items of potentially responsive correspondence. We have determined that \nboth of these records are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of \n  16  Information Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1). \n17  25.  On January 22, 2016, Plaintiff filed an administrative appeal of Defendantโs final \n18  response via mail and Defendantโs online FOIA portal. Plaintiff appealed on grounds that Defendant \n19  had failed to conduct an adequate search for records responsive to its Oct. 8 FOIA request and that \n20  Defendant had improperly withheld records under FOIA. Plaintiff sought expedited processing of its \n21  administrative appeal. \n22  26.  On February 1, 2016, Defendant acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffโs administrative \n23  appeal via email.  \n24  27.  On February 11, 2016, Defendant sent Plaintiff a second acknowledgement of its \n \n25  administrative appeal via email. In that correspondence, Defendant granted Plaintiffโs request for \n26  expedited processing of the administrative appeal. \n27 \n28 \n    -5-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 6 of 8\n \n1 \n28.  On April 4, 2016, Defendant denied Plaintiffโs administrative appeal via a letter that \n2 \nstated it was โaffirming, on partly modified grounds,โ the agencyโs initial denial of Plaintiffโs Oct. 8 \n3 \nFOIA. \n4 \n29.   In denying the administrative appeal of Plaintiffโs Oct. 8 FOIA, Defendant stated that \n5 \nif Plaintiff was โdissatisfied with my action on your appeal, the FOIA permits you to file a lawsuit in \n6 \nfederal district court in accordance with 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).โ Thus, Plaintiff has exhausted all \n7 \napplicable administrative remedies. \n8 \n30.  Defendant continues to wrongfully withhold the requested records from Plaintiff. \n9 \nPlaintiffโs FOIA request for significant or novel FISC opinions and orders \n10 \n31.  In a letter dated March 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed another FOIA request with the National \n11 \nSecurity Division of the DOJ (March 7 FOIA). The request sought: \n12  โข  Any  โdecision,  order,  or  opinion  issued  by  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \n13  (as defined in section 601(e)),โ issued from 1978 to June 1, 2015, โthat \nincludes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law, \n14  including any novel or significant construction or interpretation of the term \nโspecific selection term.โโ USA FREEDOM Act, Pub. L. 114-23, ยง 402(a) \n15  (2015), codified at 50 U.S.C. ยง 1872(a). \n \n16  โข  Any  โdecision,  order,  or  opinion  issued  by  the  Foreign  Intelligence \n \nSurveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \n17  (as defined in section 601(e)),โ issued from June 2, 2015 to present, โthat \nincludes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law, \n18  including any novel or significant construction or interpretation of the term \nโspecific selection term.โโ USA FREEDOM Act, Pub. L. 114-23, ยง 402(a) \n19  (2015), codified at 50 U.S.C. ยง 1872(a). \n20  32.  Plaintiffโs March 7 FOIA request also sought the media fee waiver and public interest \n21  fee waiver.  \n22  33.  By letter dated March 14, 2016, Defendant acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffโs March \n23  7 FOIA request. \n24  34.    On March 25, 2016, the parties discussed ways Defendant could prioritize its review \n \n25  of FISC opinions responsive to Plaintiffโs second request. By email on April 5, 2016, Plaintiff \n26  provided various suggestions for prioritization of opinions and orders that should be declassified and \n27  released.  \n28 \n    -6-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 7 of 8\n \n1 \n35.  As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to respond \n2 \nsubstantively to Plaintiffโs March 7 FOIA request. \n3 \n36.  As the statutory time period by which Defendant must respond to Plaintiffโs March 7 \n4 \nFOIA request has passed, Plaintiff has exhausted all applicable administrative remedies. \n5 \n37.  Defendant continues to wrongfully withhold the requested records from Plaintiff. \n6 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n7 \nViolation of the Freedom of Information Act for Wrongful Withholding of Agency Records \n8 \n38.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-37.   \n9 \n39.  Defendant has wrongfully withheld agency records requested by Plaintiff by failing to \n10 \nconduct an adequate search for records responsive to Plaintiffโs request, by failing to produce all \n11 \nrecords in the agencyโs possession responsive to Plaintiffโs request, and by failing to adequately \n12 \nsegregate responsive from non-responsive records. \n13 \n40.  Plaintiff  has  exhausted  applicable  administrative  remedies  with  respect  to \n14 \nDefendantโs wrongful withholding of the requested records. \n15 \n41.  Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief with respect to the release and disclosure of the \n16 \n  requested documents. \n17 \nREQUESTED RELIEF \n18 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court: \n19 \n42.  order Defendant and its components to process immediately the requested records in \n20 \ntheir entirety; \n21 \n43.  order Defendant to disclose the requested records in their entirety and make copies \n22 \navailable to Plaintiff; \n23 \n44.  order Defendant to waive all fees associated with the processing and release of the \n24 \nrequested records; \n \n25 \n45.  provide for expeditious proceedings in this action \n26 \n46.  award Plaintiff its costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in this action; and \n27 \n47.  grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n28 \n    -7-   \n  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF   \n  THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n \n \n\n \n \nCase 4:16-cv-02041-HSG   Document 1   Filed 04/19/16   Page 8 of 8\n \n \n1 \nDATED:  April 19, 2016 \n2 \n  By   /s/ Mark Rumold    \n3        Mark Rumold \n      Nathan D.
