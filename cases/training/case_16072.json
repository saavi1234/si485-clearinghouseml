    "summary": "<p>Pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") conducted an investigation of conditions at the Nim Henson Geriatric Center (\"Henson\"), a county-operated skilled nursing facility in Jackson, Kentucky.  The investigation resulted in a findings letter being sent to Breathitt County's judge executive on March 6, 2003.  The letter stated that in June 2002, DOJ and certain of its expert consultants toured the facility, interviewed administrators, residents and staff, and reviewed medical and other records.  The DOJ's investigation led it to conclude that certain conditions at Henson violated residents' federal constitutional and statutory rights.  According to the DOJ, residents at Henson suffered from deficiencies in the following areas:  1) general medical care, 2) chemical restraints, 3) wound and nutritional care, 4) restorative care, 5) psychiatric care, and 6) incident management and quality assurance.</p><p>The findings letter described that the DOJ investigators determined that the facility's medication management practices; its medical notes and documentation; and its oversight and management of medical care did not meet generally accepted standards of care.  Among the identified systemic deficiencies were unjustified use on residents of polypharmacy and psychotropic medications, inadequate monitoring of medications' effects, and failure to re-evaluate the continued necessity or dosage units of certain drugs.  The investigation found poor or absent (i) physician-pharmacist consultations, (ii) medication policies and guidelines, (iii) diagnosis and treatment of underlying disorders (rather than symptoms), (iv) medical notes and documentation, and (v) oversight and management of medical care.</p><p>The facility employed sedation for reasons not associated with a medical condition, and the intermediate care unit within the facility provided substandard wound assessment, identification, care and tracking.  Failure to appropriately respond to instances of weight loss and overuse of feeding tubes reflected poor nutritional care at the facility.  Henson's failure to provide active (as opposed to passive) group activities, an absence of functional furniture, and care plans that failed to include restorative interventions addressing preventable declines in residents' functioning were other shortcomings described in the findings letter.  Particularly in the intermediate care unit, DOJ found that the nursing staff lacked a systematized approach to resident assessment and to the provision of early intervention regarding significant changes in resident status. Additionally, at least half of the residents sampled were receiving psychiatric care that substantially departed from generally accepted standards. No psychiatric and no behavioral professionals were available to the facility; physicians and nurses at the facility had no training in geriatric psychiatry generally, or in treating individuals experiencing dementia or depression; and residents who badly needed acute psychiatric care were rarely transferred to psychiatric hospitals. Henson's incident management efforts failed to pull relevant disciplines together to identify and provide needed supports and services to prevent falls and injuries. Likewise, the facility lacked an effective quality assurance system to track significant trends and events and ensure that proper corrective action occurs. Regarding discharge planning, the DOJ found that Henson's staff did not adequately evaluate or assess residents for their discharge potential.  It failed to have its treatment professionals periodically assess whether community-based treatment was appropriate.  These latter inadequacies violated the Americans with Disabilities Act-imposed obligation to treat residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to their individual needs.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 12132 and 42 C.F.R. ยง 35.139(j).</p><p>The DOJ findings letter proposed remedial actions to remedy the multiple deficiencies, invited the county to address the issues, and alerted the county to the possibility of a CRIPA lawsuit brought by the United States to compel remedial action.</p><p>On February 17, 2004 the United States filed a complaint against Breathitt County, Kentucky, and Breathitt County Geriatric Corporation for violating CRIPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง1997, within the Nim Henson Nursing Home for the violations noted in the findings letter above. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants failed to protect residents from harm and, further, failed โto provide adequate medical, nursing, nutritional, wound, restorative, and psychiatric care to residentsโ in the nursing home. Moreover, the complaint alleged that the defendants failed to continually assess whether the treatment needs of residents were being met. </p><p>On February 19, 2004, a settlement agreement was entered with the court. Through the settlement agreement the parties agreed to the following terms:  Defendants would ensure that residents shall be promptly assessed, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and, when necessary, reassessed, diagnosed, and treated with current, generally accepted standards of care, including documentation adequate to withstand clinical scrutiny. Defendants would develop policies to fully monitor medication distribution, and the effects of medications on patients. Defendants would keep accurate, current, complete, and organized medical documentation. Defendants would cease using restrictive controls and chemical restraints except in narrow situations. Defendants would create and maintain a documentation system, as well as a formulary, for patient wound care. Furthermore, defendants would ensure that nurses knew โthe wound status of each resident in their care.โ Defendants would monitor the weight and nutrition of residents and ensure that necessary interventions occurred. Defendants would ensure residents are able to have the highest quality of life possible and develop a restorative care plan for all residents. Defendants would provide necessary psychiatric care for residents. Defendants would investigate and follow up on all โunusual incidentsโ or incidents involving injury. Defendants would routinely assess residents to see if community placement is necessary. Defendants would provide the United States Department of Justice with status report within 90 days and provide continual, unrestricted access to buildings and facilities, staff, residents, and records relating to the settlement agreement, staff, or residents </p><p>Two years after the settlement agreement, the government found that the Nim Henson Nursing Home had been complying with all the terms of the settlement agreement. As a result, the case was dismissed.</p>",

      "title": "Re: Nim Henson Geriatric Center",
      "text": "March 6, 2003 \nMr. Lewis H. Warrix \nCounty Judge Executive \nBreathitt County \n1137 Main Street \nJackson, KY  41339 \nRe: Nim Henson Geriatric Center \nDear Mr. Warrix: \nOn March 20, 2002, we informed Breathitt County that we were investigating conditions \nat Nim Henson Geriatric Center (โNim Hensonโ), in Jackson, Kentucky, pursuant to the Civil \nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (โCRIPAโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997.  In June 2002, we visited \nNim Henson. At an exit interview conducted on the last day of the visit, we verbally conveyed \nour preliminary findings to the facilityโs administrative personnel.  Consistent with the \nrequirements of CRIPA, we are now writing to apprise you of our findings. \nAs a threshold matter, we wish to acknowledge, and express our appreciation for, the \ncooperation and assistance provided to us, particularly by the facilityโs administrator, Mr. Phillip \nLitteral, and Director of Nursing, Ms. Patricia Lutes.  We hope to work with Breathitt County \nand Nim Henson administrators and staff in the same cooperative manner in addressing the \nproblems that we found. Further, we note that it was apparent that many Nim Henson staff are \ndedicated individuals who are genuinely concerned for the well-being of the persons in their care. \nWe conducted our investigation by reviewing medical and other records relating to the \ncare and treatment of individuals; interviewing administrators, staff and patients; and conducting \nan on-site review of the facility.  Our findings are supported by the assessments contained in our \nexpert consultantsโ reports. \nAt the time of our visit, Nim Henson had a bed capacity of 122; its actual census was 104. \nThe facility is divided between a โskilledโ care unit and an โintermediateโ care unit.  The skilled \ncare unit has 44 beds, 42 of which were occupied when we visited.  The remaining 78 beds are \non the intermediate care unit, 62 of which were occupied during our tour.  In addition t \nresidentsโ rooms, the facility has one large dining room, a โFloridaโ room designated for resident \nactivity, such as group programs and rehabilitation services, and a large activity annex in the rear \nof the building. \n\n-2ยญ\n\nResidents of state and county-operated facilities have a right to receive adequate health \ncare, along with habilitation, and other supports and services, to ensure their safety and freedom \nfrom unreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their ability to exercise their liberty \ninterests.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Similar protections are accorded by \nfederal statute. See, e.g., Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396; 42 C.F.R. Part \n483 (Medicaid Program Provisions); 42 U.S.C. ยง 135li-3; 42 U.S.C. ยง 483 Subpart B (Medicare). \nThe County also is obligated to provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to \nindividual residentsโ needs. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (โADAโ), 42 U.S.C. \nยง 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130 (d); see Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \nI.  Facility Conditions \nAreas in which the facility appears to be performing reasonably well include cleanliness \nin the kitchen and throughout the facility, the adequacy of staffing, and dietary supports. \nHowever, in the areas of general medical care, chemical restraints, wound and nutritional care, \nrestorative care, psychiatric care, and incident management and quality assurance, Nim Henson \ndoes not provide levels of care that are consistent with the Constitution or statutory or regulatory \nrequirements. Our findings, the facts supporting them, and the remedial steps that we believe are \nnecessary are set forth below. \nA.  General Medical Care \nAs a nursing home, Nim Henson is required to provide medical, nursing and related \nservices to โattain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well \nbeing of each resident.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1396r(b)(4)(A).  Nim Henson is not meeting these \nstandards. More particularly, its medication management practices; its medical notes and \ndocumentation; and its oversight and management of medical care do not meet generally \naccepted standards of care.  These deficiencies place residents at risk of harm. \n1.  Medication Management \nGenerally accepted standards of care dictate that use of medications, especially those \nhaving potentially harmful side effects, be clinically justified.  This is particularly true when \ndrugs are used in combinations that increase the risk of harm and when drugs are used that pose \nparticular risks for the elderly.  Generally accepted standards of care also dictate that, for drugs \nhaving therapeutic ranges, below which the drug is ineffective and above which it is potentially \ntoxic, monitoring be conducted pursuant to generally accepted protocols to ensure that the drug is \nhelping, not harming, the patient.  Generally accepted  standards of care further dictate that \nconsideration routinely be given to whether continued use of drugs, and the amounts in which \nthey are consumed, remains appropriate, or whether the drugs can be tapered down or replaced \nby others having fewer adverse side effects.  As a general matter, none of these standards of care \nis adhered to at Nim Henson. The facility has virtually no medication management, and many of \nits residents are harmed or placed at risk of harm every day as a result. \n\n-3ยญ\n\na.  Lack of Clinical Justification for Prescribed Medications \nAt the time of our review, 40 percent of the Nim Henson residents were receiving more \nthan nine medications, and several residents were actually receiving 15 to 25 separate \nmedications. In many, if not most, instances, the residentsโ medical records contained no clinical \njustification for these medications, and frequently certain medications appeared to be prescribed \ninappropriately.  \nOften, powerful psychotropic medications were administered to patients based solely on \nnursesโ observations that they were โagitated.โ  Agitation, although a potential symptom of \nmultiple medical problems, including both psychosis and physical pain, is not itself a disease or \ndisorder, and does not alone provide a clinical justification for psychotropic medications. \nPhysicians routinely issued standing daily orders for certain medications that ordinarily would be \ngiven on an as-needed basis. \nb.  Unjustified Use of Polypharmacy \nThe use of more than one medication from the same class (polypharmacy) can be \nappropriate in some cases but must always be clinically justified.  At Nim Henson, many patients \nwere subjected to multiple psychotropic, anticholinergic, and/or benzodiazepine medications \nwithout clinical justification. Psychotropic medications can irreversibly cause uncontrollable \nmuscle spasms, muscular rigidity, restricted speech and movement, and agitation, among other \nside effects.  They also can cause swallowing difficulties, a particular concern at Nim Henson, \nbecause, as discussed below, an unusually high percentage of its residents are fed through \ngastrointestinal feeding tubes.  Anticholinergic medications can cause mental confusion, \nespecially in the elderly, as can benzodiazepines, which can be  addictive.  Each of these classes \nof medication can have great therapeutic value, but if used inappropriately can cause great harm. \nWhen, as at Nim Henson, multiple drugs within and among each of these classes of medication \nare prescribed to a resident without clinical justification, there is a significant likelihood that that \nresident is being seriously harmed.  Certainly, a high number of Nim Henson residents displayed \nsymptoms consistent with many of the harmful side effects of polypharmacy, particularly \nmuscular rigidity, swallowing difficulties, restricted speech and movement, and mental \nconfusion. \nc.  Inadequate Monitoring to Ensure Medications are Therapeutic \nMany medications commonly used at Nim Henson, such as valproic acid, Phenobarbital, \nDilantin, Tegretol, and Digitalis, must be monitored to ensure that their dosages are neither \nsubtherapeutic, and ineffective, nor toxically high.  According to the facilityโs consulting \npharmacist, Nim Henson has no policies regarding the monitoring of such medications; \nmonitoring is a matter left to each physician.  This, in itself, is problematic.  In any event, our \nchart review found little evidence that monitoring of these drugs was occurring at appropriate \nintervals, and we found several patients who were receiving subtherapeutic levels of mood \n\n-4ยญ\n\nstabilizers and antidepressants, such as resident K.D.,1 whose lithium and valproic acid levels had \nbeen documented as low on January 20, 2002, without a physicianโs order to increase them, and \nresident P.D., whose Zoloft level was also subtherapeutic.  Further, although many Nim Henson \nresidents are on Lipitor, their charts do not indicate that their cholesterol or serum lipids are \nmeasured.  Dosing of Aricept (used to treat Alzheimerโs disease) at a much less than \nrecommended amount was common, rendering the medication useless. \nd.\t Lack of Appropriate Consideration for Patientsโ Medication \nRegimen \nWe saw little evidence that Nim Henson physicians periodically reevaluated the \ncontinued necessity of certain drugs or drug dosage levels when symptoms of the condition for \nwhich the medication ostensibly had been prescribed had not arisen for extended periods of time \nand when alternative, less harmful medications were available.  More fundamentally, based on \nour chart review, and with more than 40 percent of its residents prescribed nine or more \nmedications and many receiving 15 to 25 drugs, it appears that the physicians frequently add \nmedications with scant consideration of the impact on the existing pharmacological mix.  In \nparticular, they did not appear routinely to consider whether changes in the existing drug regimen \nwere warranted. \nFor example, T.I.โs medications include phenobarbital, propranolol, valproic acid, iron, \nClaritin, Miacalcin, Oscal, Colace, Macrobid, Toprol, Isordil, Lipitor, Plavix, Ranitidine, \nDulcolax, Darvon, and Lactulose.  Many of these medications appear to be duplicative; in the \nabsence of clinical justification for them in T.I.โs chart, such duplicative medications are \nunwarranted. \nI.N.โs medications include thiothixine, Estrace, Claritin, Dulcolax, nitroglycerine, \nTylenol, Glucophage, insulin coverage, digoxin, Lasix, nitropaste, Inderal Zoloft, Lipitor, \npropylthiouracil (PTU), Aricept, Ditropan, Metformin, Oscal, Coumadin, and Actos.  Few of \nthese medications were justified in the medical record.  The use of thiothixine (Navane), an anti \npsychotic medication, without justification, is of special concern. \nS.T.โs medications include Micalin, Prozac, methocarbamol, milk of magnesia, Tylenol, \nmeclizine, Mylanta, Darvocet, Protonix, Claritin, Cozaar, Flovent, Lasix, potassium, Serevent \ninhaler, Glyburide, iron, and vitamin C.  This is a complex medication regimen that is not \nclinically justified in the residentโs medical notes. \nSome medications used at Nim Henson are especially  problematic, such as \nPhenobarbital. This is a sedating, potentially addictive, barbiturate, the use of which is not \nrecommended in the elderly.  An unusually high number of Nim Henson residents were \n1To protect their privacy, we do not refer to residents by their actual initials.  We will \ntransmit separately a schedule that will enable the facility to identify these individuals. \n\n-5ยญ\n\nprescribed this medication, although most individuals with seizure disorders today are treated \nwith other, less potentially harmful medications.  The facilityโs consulting pharmacist offered no \njustification for the high Phenobarbital use, other than that these patients were all on \nPhenobarbital when she began consulting to the facility.  Certainly, we saw no evidence that \nattempts had been made to switch residents to less harmful alternatives. \ne.  Poor Physician-Pharmacist Consultation \nA contributing factor to the facilityโs medical management difficulties is the lack of \neffective consultation between the facilityโs consulting pharmacist and the physicians who treat \nits residents. Although the pharmacist reportedly reviews each patient chart once a month and \nmakes medication recommendations in the chart, she stated that she rarely meets or \ncommunicates directly with the medical director or physicians.  Further, she told us that her \nrecommendations were often ignored.  Our own chart review indicated that, at least in the case of \nN.C., the treating physician either did not see or chose to ignore each of the pharmacistโs monthly \nmedication recommendations that we reviewed. \nf.  Lack of Adequate Medication Policies and Guidelines \nIn addition to policies and procedures regarding the monitoring of medication blood \nlevels, referred to above, Nim Henson lacks adequate policies and guidelines regarding use of \npolypharmacy, reduction or replacement of older, more harmful \nmedications, and reduction or elimination of unnecessary medications. \ng.  Inadequate Consideration of Etiologies \nIn the absence of clinical direction from the medical director or facility policies and \nprocedures, the physicians have focused on treating symptoms identified by facility staff, rather \nthan diagnosing and treating the underlying sickness or disorder.  This is especially apparent in \nthe excessive number of residents receiving valium, and other sedatives not recommended for the \nelderly, because of problems with โagitation.โ  \n2.  Medical Notes and Documentation \nNim Hensonโs medical documentation is unreliable.  The facility lacks records through \nwhich it can accurately track wounds for residents on its intermediate care unit, and there \ntypically is little documentation supporting the use of psychotropic and other medications. \nPhysicianโs notes often are seriously deficient.  \nA comparison of resident โcondition changeโ reports, documented by nurses in their \nnotes, with physician entries for the same time period indicates that physician assessments are \noften incomplete or inaccurate.  For instance, during the period in which nurses filed three \nโcondition changeโ notifications regarding developments in I.N.โs medical status, the treating \nphysician entered four sets of notes (on December 12, 2001, February 10, 2002, April 10, 2002, \n\n-6ยญ\n\nand June 10, 2002).  Apart from a date change, the physicianโs assessments of I.N.โs condition \nwere word-for-word identical, and nowhere in them did the physician address the medical \nchanges that prompted the nurses to prepare the three condition change reports.  In our chart \nreview, we found numerous examples in which physician notes were identical, or nearly \nidentical, over extended periods.  For instance, the May 31, 2002 and June 12, 2002 physician \nnotes in K.I.โs chart were identical, the monthly physician notes in H.M.โs chart for a six-month \nperiod were basically the same, and the notes in P.I.โs chart for December 1, 2001, February 2, \n2002, April 2, 2002, and June 2, 2002 were exactly the same.  \nFurther, a physician acknowledged to us at the facility that he assesses patients without \nrecording notes on their condition.  Although the physiciansโ notes should provide a reliable \nguide as to residentsโ condition and symptoms, and should provide a reliable basis for diagnoses \nand corresponding treatments, physician notes at Nim Henson do not.  Without reliable \ndocumentation, it is impossible, over time, to track changes in medical status, assess the accuracy \nof diagnoses, and evaluate the efficacy of treatments.  Nim Hensonโs medical documentation \ndeficiencies constitute a substantial departure from generally accepted standards of care that \nexpose Nim Henson residents to actual harm or significant risk of harm.  These deficiencies are \nparticularly troubling in light of the fact that the facility exercises no oversight, either by peers or \nthe medical director, of physician care. \n3.  Oversight and Management of Medical Care \nGenerally accepted standards of care dictate that nursing home residents receive accurate \nand timely assessments, proper diagnoses of the etiology of the assessed conditions, treatment \nbased on the diagnoses, monitoring of the individualโs condition and the treatmentsโ efficacy, \nand, as appropriate, revised diagnoses and treatment.  Without such elements of care, nursing \nhome residents are at risk of inadequate medical care.  As discussed above, each of these \nelements of care at Nim Henson has significant shortcomings, a fact that indicates that a \nfunctioning, competent medical director is not in place at Nim Henson. \nThe current Nim Henson medical director has retired from the active practice of medicine \nand is available to the facility for one half-day a week.  In interviews, he indicated that he had \ntaken the position of medical director reluctantly and that he had no particular expertise in \ngeriatric medicine, or in the supervision and management of physicians.  He acknowledged that \nhis current contractual arrangement with the facility keeps his involvement there extremely \nlimited and that he has essentially no leadership or quality assurance role.  Instead, his duties, as \nhe described them, were โreactiveโ and were limited to assisting in locating physicians for Nim \nHenson residents who lacked them. He acknowledged that there is little, if any, interdisciplinary \ninvolvement in the treatment of Nim Hensonโs residents and that the physicians work \nindependently of one another.  In fact, he stated that unless someone brings a problem to his \nattention, he does not know whether the facilityโs medical care is sufficient. \nNim Henson effectively has no functioning medical director.  Its medical services are \ndevoid of supervision and quality assurance checks.  The primary care physicians, none of whom \n\n-7ยญ\n\nhave had formal training or prior experience in geriatric medicine, do not receive adequate \nguidance.  These deficiencies heavily contribute to the significant problems in medical care at \nthis facility that expose its residents to actual and potential harm. \nB.  Chemical Restraints \nFacility staff expressly stated to us that it was often necessary to keep residents sedated to \navoid potential staff injuries. One nurse we questioned about the appropriateness of a medicine \nthat is identified by a nationally recognized standard, the so-called โBeerโs List,โ as inadvisable \nfor use in the elderly, replied that the drug was nevertheless warranted for one elderly resident, \nbecause without it, โhe would come alive.โ During our visit, we saw numerous residents who \nappeared to be heavily sedated.  Medicating residents for reasons not associated with a medical \ncondition is a violation of federal regulations and does not comport with generally accepted \nstandards of care. This practice constitutes impermissible chemical restraint, and it is harming \nmany Nim Henson residents.  Staff concerns for safety are certainly appropriate, but there are \nviable alternatives to overly sedating residents with medications that are dangerous to the elderly. \nC.  Wound Care \nWounds in nursing homes are common and include skin tears, pressure ulcers, surgical \nwounds, and wounds related to vascular disease.  Pressure sores are an important and universally \naccepted indicator of the quality of skin care.  The facilityโs wound care policy appeared to be \nadequate. Further, from our review, it appeared that wound care on the facilityโs skilled \nnursing unit was generally adequate, although this was not true for the facilityโs intermediate care \nwing.  \nOn the skilled nursing unit, treatments that we observed were performed using accepted \ninfection control techniques, respecting resident dignity, and utilizing currently accepted wound \ncare practices. Pressure relief surfaces appeared to be appropriate, and wound tracking sheets \nwere utilized to document weekly size and appearance of wounds.  Although the care of pressure \nulcers on this unit seemed to be good, it appeared that inadequate care was provided to one \nresident, whose recent surgical wound bore obvious signs of infection. \nOn the intermediate care unit, we randomly selected for review two residents who were \nidentified by the facility as having Stage I pressure ulcers, which are characterized by a persistent \narea of nonblanchable skin redness. We found that each resident actually had Stage II ulcers, \nwhich involve a partial loss of skin layer that presents clinically as an abrasion, blister, or shallow \ncrater.  Even after we notified staff of the further deterioration of these residentsโ skin, the \nmedical chart for one them was not updated to indicate that he had experienced any skin \nbreakdown. \nThese residentsโ continued skin breakdown appeared to be caused, at least in part, by the \nfacilityโs failure to provide them with any preventative devices, such as anti-pressure mattress \noverlays, or to position them properly.  In fact, eight hours after we first notified the facility of \n\n-8ยญ\n\nthese residentsโ Stage II ulcers, neither of the residents had received anti-pressure relieving \nsupports. One resident appeared to have been left lying in the same position in which we found \nhim, with his weight still bearing on his wound.  Further, although the responsible nursing staff \nthen on duty should have been monitoring both of these residents carefully, that staff clearly did \nnot even know that either resident had developed any skin breakdown.  \nWhen we asked why one resident had not been repositioned after we had alerted staff to \nhis condition, we were told that he does not stay in position and โrolls back over.โ  It later \nbecame apparent that at least four residents on this unit who were considered to be high-risk for \nskin breakdowns were not repositioned in accordance with the facilityโs own policy or  generally \naccepted standards of care, and a family member of a resident told us that he had developed a bed \nsore, which the family first discovered, because he was not properly repositioned. \nThe intermediate care unit lacked wound tracking sheets or any other system through \nwhich it could identify, assess and monitor wounds.  Further, it appeared from interviews of \nnurses on this unit that, generally speaking, they could not identify residents who had wounds, \nresidents who were at risk of wound development, and residents who required frequent \nmonitoring for repositioning. \nD.  Nutritional Care \n1.  Weight Loss/Gain \nParticularly in the elderly, significant changes in weight are often an indication of, and \ncontributor to, significant  changes in general health.  Adequate weight monitoring is an essential \ncomponent of nursing home health care.  Generally speaking, Nim Henson is properly \nmonitoring and developing appropriate nutritional interventions for its residents.  \nCommendably and importantly, it appeared from our review that residents were weighed \nand reweighed appropriately.  Also, the dietician was notified promptly of weight loss/gain and \nrecommended appropriate nutritional interventions.  Further, it appeared that residents were \nbeing served the proper diet, with thickened liquids and โself-helpโ feeding devices, as \nappropriate.  The facilityโs โRed Napkinโ program was useful in assisting staff in identifying \nresidents targeted due to recent weight loss. \nHowever, issues involving tube-fed residents, discussed below, suggest that there are \nsome problems in the area of nutrition. The facility also is not systemically tracking, through \nfood intake records, residents who have sustained weight loss.  It also did not consistently notify \nphysicians or responsible parties of significant changes in weight.  Further, the facility did not \nreliably update care plans to describe the interventions for the weight loss or gain.  \nMost fundamentally, in the 15 charts that we reviewed of residents who had experienced \nsignificant weight loss during the month of our tour, there was no evidence to suggest any \nphysician involvement in determining the cause of the weight loss, such as presence of infection, \n\n-9ยญ\n\npsychotropic or other medications, or psychosocial factors.  This absence of physician input \nunacceptably places residents at significant risk of harm, as it leaves potentially unaddressed the \nroot causes for the change in weight. \n2.  Use of Gastrostomy Feeding Tubes \nThe decision to insert a feeding tube into a resident should involve the resident, family, \nphysician, nutritionist, nurse, and speech therapist.  Investigation of a residentโs condition should \ninclude the extent and cause of the swallowing disorder, the potential for improvement through \nstrengthening exercises of the torso, and the need for special diets. Medications warrant \nparticular consideration, because medications such as psychotropics can cause or exacerbate \nswallowing problems.  General psychosocial factors must also be reviewed, as the personโs mood \nand sense of wellbeing will inevitably contribute to a willingness and ability to eat. \nAn overuse of feeding tubes is an indication that a facility is failing adequately to handle \nresidentsโ weight loss, decline in physical function, and slowness in eating.  Tube feeding tends \nto be the easiest and most convenient manner by which to deal with these issues.  Thus, when a \nnursing home has a comparatively high rate of feeding tube use and lacks clinical justification for \nthat high rate, the implication arises that decisions are being made for the convenience of staff \nrather than in the interests of the residents. \nNim Henson fails to provide adequate assessments of and interventions for residents \nexperiencing swallowing difficulties.  A significant number of residents are placed on feeding \ntubes without clinical justification, under questionable circumstances.  Sixteen percent of Nim \nHensonโs residents have gastronomy tubes.  As the facilityโs speech therapist acknowledged to \nus, this is an unusually high figure.  Although the characteristics of a particular nursing homeโs \nresidents may justify a high percentage of feeding tube use, such justification was not apparent at \nNim Henson. \nOur interviews with staff revealed minimal direct communication between the physicians, \non one hand, and the speech therapist, dietician and nurse, on the other, regarding decisions \naround tube feeding.  To the contrary, these interviews made clear that the physicians decide to \ninsert gastrostomy feeding tubes into Nim Henson residents without receiving the input of other \nrelevant disciplines. Our chart review of selected tube-fed residents also did not reveal an \nadequate interdisciplinary investigation of poor oral intake.  Finally, it was clear from our \nconsultantsโ face-to-face examinations of selected tube-fed residents that the use of the \ngastrostomy tube was, at best, sometimes highly questionable. \nK.I. provides a telling example.  Her medical chart contains a June 7, 2002 note by the \nspeech therapist that the resident โswallows okay,โ and numerous physiciansโ notes over the \nseven months immediately preceding our visit contain similar assessments.  Remarkably, when \nwe met with K.I., she offered us candy bars and proceeded to eat one, herself โ- with no \ndifficulty.  Obviously, K.I.โs physician was not actively engaged in determining this residentโs \nnutritional needs, and her use of a feeding tube was unjustified. \n\n-10ยญ\n\nE.  Restorative Care \n1.  Physical Environment \nDuring our tour, staff appeared to be kind, respectful and friendly, and they answered call \nbuttons promptly.  The facility was generally neat and clean.  Residents were out of bed and \ninvolved in activities. Most residents were dressed and wearing shoes.  These observations \nreflect positive staff-patient interactions and good restorative care, although they are tempered \nsomewhat by comments that we received from family members of various residents to the effect \nthat the facility had โreally cleaned up its actโ in anticipation of our visit. \n2.  Active Treatment \nFederal regulations recognize the critical importance that activities and mental \nstimulation play in maintaining good  health among nursing home residents.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. \n483.15(f)(โfacility must provide for an ongoing program of activities designed to meet . . . the \ninterests and the physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each residentโ).  The activities \nthat we observed did not meet resident needs.  In the same vein, we understand that the facility \nintentionally congregates residents of varying cognitive abilities to stimulate lower-functioning \nresidents. This essentially passive practice, which is not used in conjunction with active \ninterventions, does little to help the more cognitively impaired and, rather than motivate higher-\nfunctioning residents, is likely to foster despair and depression. Group activities can meet \nimportant rehabilitative goals, but only if those activities are reasonably targeted to the \nparticipantsโ abilities and needs. Nim Hensonโs group activities are not. \nAlso, more than half of Nim Hensonโs residents eat their meals in their rooms.  Providing \nin-room dining occupies a significant portion of the nursing staffโs workload and keeps staff \nfrom care-related activities. This practice also limits social opportunities for residents and \nignores a major opportunity to provide rehabilitation in the practical, meaningful context of \ncoming to the dining room and eating with others.  \nThe facility lacks adequate functional furniture, such as dining room chairs and recliners, \nthus relegating many residents to their wheelchairs.  This shortcoming predisposes residents to \nfunctional decline, falls, poor posture, contractures, and skin breakdown. \n3.  Care Planning \nOur review of 15 patient charts indicated that the plan of care for each resident accurately \nreflected the results of the facilityโs assessment of that resident.  Further, each care plan that we \nreviewed addressed the residentsโ needs, strengths and preferences, as identified in the residentโs \nassessment. However, one out of every three care plans that we reviewed failed to provide \nrestorative interventions addressing preventable declines in the residentโs functioning, \npredisposing residents to loss of function, contractures, worsening incontinence and/or \nbehavioral difficulties.  That is, in a high number of reviewed care plans, Nim Henson did not \n\n-11ยญ\n\nprovide appropriate supports and services to address preventable declines in its residentsโ \ncondition, predisposing them to harm.  Further, the facilityโs use of chemical restraints appeared \nto increase with residentsโ loss of function, and the reviewed charts indicated that, in such \ninstances, social work and related disciplines did not develop individualized alternatives to the \nchemical restraints. \n4.  Interventions Regarding Change of Status \nThe certified nursing aids (โCNAsโ)with whom we spoke demonstrated an understanding \nof the residentsโ direct care needs and restorative care.  They also demonstrated that they knew \nthe residentsโ preferences and routines. The nurses we spoke with demonstrated an \nunderstanding of general resident information and needs. \nHowever, particularly on the intermediate care unit, it was evident that staff often did not \nidentify and respond to significant changes in residentsโ health status.  As indicated above, nurses \nwe spoke with there were not able to properly assess skin breakdowns.  They often were unable \nto identify where pertinent data were located or which residents were presenting clinically \nsignificant problems.  \nOne of the nurses we spoke with was unaware that a resident for whom she had \nresponsibility appeared to be excessively sedated, and she did not appear to recognize that his \nsedated condition constituted a change of status that she should bring to the attention of the \nresidentโs physician. \nNurses were slow to detect, and then act on, a resident who had recently returned from the \nhospital and appeared to be excessively lethargic and impaired.  The residentโs oral intake of \nfood and liquids also appeared low. After our team identified this resident to nursing staff, we \nwere notified that she had been transferred to a hospital emergency room with a diagnosis of \nprobable CVA (stroke) and dehydration. \nParticularly on the intermediate care unit, nursing staff does not have a systematized \napproach to resident assessment and the provision of early intervention regarding significant \nchanges in resident status.  The process by which nurses communicate changes in resident \nclinical status is weak. Nurses do not clearly understand their role in assessing for and reporting \nclinical changes to the physicians, especially regarding medication side effects, functional \ndecline, new onset incontinence, and behavioral exacerbations. \nF.  Psychiatric Care \nNim Hensonโs residents have a right to adequate health care, including appropriate \npsychiatric supports and services.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324; 42 C.F.R. ยง 1396.  Many of \nNim Hensonโs residents suffer from dementia, depression, or other psychiatric disorders, yet the \nfacility provides essentially no effective psychiatric treatment for them.  These residents either \nare untreated or treated incorrectly, leaving their distress unchecked and sometimes worsened. \n\n-12ยญ\n\nDuring our tour, we reviewed 14 residents chosen randomly from a list of residents \nhaving multiple psychiatric diagnoses and/or receiving multiple psychotropic medications.  From \nour chart review and interviews of these residents, at least three displayed an immediate, unmet \nneed for aggressive psychiatric interventions, including possible hospitalization; the primary \nintervention for acute psychiatric or behavioral episodes for another two was sedation; another \nappeared to be excessively sedated when we spoke with her; another displayed a significant, but \nunaddressed, tremor and other side effects of psychotropic medications; and another was \nreceiving sub-therapeutic doses of an antidepressant.  Thus, at least half of the residents sampled \nwere receiving psychiatric care that substantially departed from generally accepted standards. \nAs with the facilityโs medication management practices generally, its management of \npsychotropic medications is poor.  Further, no psychiatric and no behavioral professional is \navailable to the facility; physicians and nurses at the facility have no training in geriatric \npsychiatry generally, or in treating individuals experiencing dementia or depression; and \nresidents who badly need acute psychiatric care are rarely transferred to psychiatric hospitals. \nAlso, as noted above, physicians at the facility tend to prescribe medications for presenting \nsymptoms rather than to address the underlying cause.  Thus, residents in acute distress are \nsedated, in violation of federal regulations and generally accepted standards of care, instead of \nreceiving appropriate psychiatric or behavioral supports to address the cause of the distress. \nG.  Incident Management and Quality Assurance \n1.  Incident Management \nNim Hensonโs management meets monthly to review all incidents.  Further, falls are \ntracked according to time and location through an analysis of incident reports and post-fall \nassessments.  The reports often identify interventions, which appear to be immediately \nimplemented.  The interventions, however, are inadequate.  \nThe most frequent intervention, even with residents who are cognitively impaired, is to \nโremind to use the call bell.โ The inadequacies of this approach are self-evident and underscore \nthat the primary deficiency of the facilityโs falls management practices is its failure to anticipate \nand limit foreseeable incidents. \nIn this regard, the facility does not perform individualized assessments to develop \ntreatment plans to prevent the reoccurrence of falls and similar incidents.  Further, as indicated \nabove, it does not provide a comprehensive restorative program to maximize resident function \nand thereby decrease risk of falls and injury.  It also does not conduct quality control \nenvironmental rounds to identify and correct potential threats to resident safety.  Most \nfundamentally, Nim Henson does not pull  relevant disciplines together to identify and provide \nneeded supports and services to prevent falls and injuries.  Consequently, post-fall assessments \ndo not address root causes of falls, such as incontinence, medications, medical problems, \nfunctional decline, seating and/or presence of illness.  Accordingly, interventions are not \n\n-13ยญ\n\nadequate. \nFor instance, a major intervention for bed falls at Nim Henson is the use of fully elevated \nside rails (โfull side railsโ). One night when we toured the facility, 62 out of 104 residents were \nin beds with full side rails in place.  Nursing home residents are prone to becoming entangled in \nthe full side rails and injured, and residents often attempt to climb over the rails to exit the bed, \nfalling in the process to the floor.  Many of the residents whom we observed with full side rails \nwere cognitively impaired, which increases their susceptibility to injury.  \nFull side rail use, as a fall intervention, is a substantial departure from generally accepted \nstandards of care and exposes residents to risk of harm.  Further, full side rails are restraints and \nshould be planned for as such. See 42 C.F.R.   ยง 483.13(a). Failure to do so violates federal \nregulations, which require that all restraints be addressed in the individualโs plan of care, along \nwith identified alternatives to the restraint, and that restorative care be provided to eliminate the \nneed for the restraint. \nNim Hensonโs primary intervention (used greater than 80 percent of the time) for falls \nfrom chairs is chair alarms. Because of their extensive use, alarms sound so frequently at the \nfacility that staff tend to ignore them, rendering them ineffective. \n2.  Quality Assurance \nIt is standard practice in facilities like Nim Henson to have a quality assurance program \nthat:  (1) actively collects data relating to the quality of services, (2) assesses these data for \ntrends, (3) initiates inquiries regarding problematic trends and possible deficiencies, (4) identifies \ncorrective action, and  (5) monitors to ensure that appropriate remedies are achieved.  It is \napparent from its difficulties in most of the foregoing areas, especially medication management, \nthat Nim Henson lacks an effective quality assurance system that can track significant trends and \nevents and ensure that proper corrective action occurs.  This systemic weakness leaves its \nresidents vulnerable to risk of harm. \nH.  Most Integrated Setting \nNim Hensonโs treatment professionals do not assess residents to determine whether their \ncontinued stay at the facility, rather than in more integrated settings, is appropriate.  This is \ncontrary to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  See 42 C.F.R. ยง \n35.139(j)(public entities must provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nneeds of the individual); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999) (public entity is required to \nprovide community-based treatment when the entityโs treatment professionals have determined \nthat community placement is appropriate, the affected person does not oppose such treatment, \nand the placement can be reasonably accomodated).  In failing to have its treatment professionals \nperiodically assess whether community-based treatment is appropriate, Nim Henson improperly \nconstrains the possibility of any its residents being served in a more integrated setting. \n\n-14ยญ\n\nII.  Minimum Remedial Measures \nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the constitutional and federal \nstatutory rights of Nim Henson residents, Nim Henson should implement promptly, at a minium, \nthe following measures. \nA.  General Medical Care \nNim Henson residents should be promptly assessed, diagnosed, treated, monitored and, as \nmonitoring indicates is necessary, reassessed, diagnosed and treated, consistent with current \nstandards of care, including with documentation adequate to withstand clinical scrutiny. \n1.  Medication Management \nEvery Nim Henson resident should receive prescription medications only after first \nhaving been thoroughly evaluated/worked up and diagnosed according to generally accepted \nstandards of care, including with sufficient documentation to withstand clinical scrutiny, and \neach medication similarly should be clinically justified as an appropriate treatment for the \ndiagnosed medical condition for which it is prescribed.  More particularly, Nim Henson should: \na.  develop and implement adequate policies and protocols regarding: \n(i)  blood level monitoring for medications such as                     \nanticonvulsants, lithium and digitalis; \n(ii)  medication side effect monitoring; \n(iii)  use and monitoring of medications that are problematic for \nthe elderly, such as benzodiazepines and anticholinergic \nmedications; \n(iv)  long-term use of medications for conditions when the \nrelevant symptoms are unchanged over long periods of \ntime; and \n(v)  use of as-needed (i.e., โPRNโ) sedatives and analgesics. \nb.  undertake a thorough evaluation/workup of all current residents \nand determine whether there is a clinically justifiable, current \ndiagnosis for each medication that each individual receives. \nc.  ensure that all remaining medications are prescribed at optimum \ntherapeutic levels and that all polypharmacy is clinically justified. \nd.  monitor all medications for efficacy, side effects and continued \nappropriateness; and modify medication usage as monitoring \nwarrants. \n\n-15ยญ\n\ne.\t conduct chart reviews to ensure that, on an ongoing basis, all \nmedications are clinically justified and are prescribed consistent \nwith applicable facility policies and protocols. \nf.\t ensure that its Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (โP&T \nCommitteeโ), with input from its medical director, pharmacist, \npharmacy consultant, and administration, promptly provides \nguidance to its physicians regarding \nthe use of polypharmacy and the use of medications \ncontraindicated in the elderly. \ng.\t ensure that, either through the P&T Committee or otherwise, the \npharmacist, pharmacy consultant, and physicians communicate \ndirectly and regularly regarding the appropriateness of medications \nused, alone or in combination, on facility residents, and regarding \ndevelopments in medications. \n2.  Medical Notes and Documentation \nMedical notes and documentation should be accurate, current, complete and organized in \na manner allowing relevant information to be quickly identified. \n3.  Oversight and Management of Medical Care \nNim Henson should retain a well-qualified medical director who would be responsible for \nmaintaining a consistent level of adequate medical care throughout the facility.  More \nparticularly, Nim Henson should ensure that the medical director will: \na.\t dedicate sufficient time to the facility to provide adequate oversight \nand management of medical care at the facility.  \nb.\t establish a medical quality assurance program that: \n(i)  actively collects data relating to the quality of medical \nservices; \n(ii)\t assesses these data for trends; \n(iii)\t initiates inquiries regarding problematic trends and possible \ndeficiencies; \n(iv)\t identifies corrective action; and \n(v)\t monitors to ensure that appropriate remedies are achieved. \nc.\t establish a system to track errors in the administration of medicine. \nd.\t establish uniform medical care policies and protocols, particularly \n\n-16ยญ\n\nregarding medication usage, nutrition and wound care, to ensure \nthe consistent provision of medical care. \ne.\t take an active role in chart review and quality assurance in medical \ndocumentation. \nf. \t ensure the provision of appropriate specialized medical services, \nsuch as psychiatric, neurologic, dental, opthalmologic, podiatric \nand dental care. \ng.\t take an active role in staff education regarding critical issues such \nas psychiatric symptoms, medication side effects, nutrition, \ninfection control, and wound care. \nB.   Chemical Restraints \nAny device, procedure or medication that restricts, limits or directs a person's freedom of \nmovement (including, but not limited to, powerful sedatives) (\"Restrictive Controls\") should be \nused only when less restrictive measures have been unsuccessfully attempted and not as a \nsubstitute for treatment of the underlying causes of the condition provoking the Restrictive \nControls. More specifically, Nim Henson should: \n1.\t comply with 42 C.F.R. ยง 483.13 and other federal regulations that prohibit \nthe use of physical or chemical restraints not required to treat a residentโs \nmedical condition. \n2.\t provide meaningful activities, restorative care and psychosocial supports \nto minimize the occurrence of disruptive or dangerous behavior. \n3.\t eliminate use of all Restrictive Controls except: \na.\t when treatment strategies have been considered and attempted and \nwould not protect the person or others from harm; \nb.\t other less intrusive or restricted methods have been ineffective; and \nc.\t as a temporary, planned intervention in a plan of care, in which the \nunderlying cause of the condition leading to Restrictive Controls \nhas been clinically determined, or on an emergency basis, when an \nunexpected crisis situation occurs in which a person poses an \nimmediate risk of harm to self or others. \n4.\t develop and implement a policy on Restrictive Controls that comports \n\n-17ยญ\n\nwith federal regulations and generally accepted standards of care. \nC.\t Wound Care \nNim Henson should ensure that wounds are promptly detected, closely monitored and \nproperly treated, consistent with current  standards of care, including with documentation \nadequate to withstand clinical scrutiny.  More particularly, Nim Henson should: \n1.  establish a facility-wide system for wound tracking that would include: \na.\t timely and accurate wound statistics; \nb.\t a master list, updated at least daily, of residents with wounds \n(including pressure ulcers, surgical wounds and skin tears), \nidentifying preventative measures, sites, stages, and treatments; \nand \nc.\t quality assurance evaluations of wound treatments and outcomes, \nincluding incidences of facility-acquired wounds and stages, \nwound statistics, and staff compliance with facility wound care \npolicies and protocols. \n2. \t ensure that all staff responsible for resident care are competent in pressure \nulcer prevention and staging. \n3. \t ensure that nursing staff know the current wound status of each resident in \ntheir care, promptly communicate changes in wound status to the \nresidentโs physician and promptly document such changes. \n4. \t establish a wound care formulary. \nD.  Nutrition \nNim Henson should ensure that, in addition to properly monitoring its residentsโ weight, \nit provide residents, especially those with swallowing difficulties, appropriate dietary and \nnutritional interventions. More particularly, Nim Henson should: \n1.\t systemically track, through food intake records, residents who have \nsustained weight change. \n2.\t consistently notify physicians and responsible parties of significant \nchanges in weight. \n3.\t ensure that, for residents experiencing significant weight change: \n\n-18ยญ\n\na.\t a comprehensive investigation of the extent and cause of the \nresidentโs condition is performed that includes consideration of \npotentially reversible or treatable factors, such as medications, \nenvironmental conditions, disease state, sensory loss, cognitive \nstatus and mood; \nb.\t the potential for improvement be fully considered before a feeding \ntube is used; \nc.\t ensure that staff responsible for resident care know the indications \nthat justify the use of tube feeding; \nd.\t ensure appropriate interdisciplinary participation in identifying \ninterventions for the weight change, and particularly in the decision \nto insert a feeding tube into a resident, including participation from \npersons such as the resident, the residentโs family, the physician, \nthe nutritionist, the nurse, and the speech therapist; \ne.\t ensure that the considerations leading to use of feeding tubes are \nfully documented in the residentโs chart; \nf.\t ensure that residents with a feeding tube are reviewed on an \nongoing basis to determine whether the tube can be discontinued; \ng.\t reliably update care plans to describe interventions for the weight \nchange; \nh.\t ensure that direct care staff are competent in implementing the \nweight change interventions identified in the care plan; and \ni.\t monitor, and revise, as necessary, the weight change interventions. \nE.  Restorative Care \nNim Henson should assist its residents to โattain or maintain the highest practicable \nphysical, mental and psychosocial well-being.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395i-3(b)(4)(A).  More particularly, \nit should: \n1. \t develop and implement restorative care plan policies and procedures that \nare consistent with federal regulations, see, e.g., 42 C.F.R.ยง 483.25, \naddressing change in resident condition. \n2. \t develop and implement a plan for each resident to provide restorative care \n\n-19ยญ\n\nbased on the residentโs assessed needs.  At appropriate intervals, reassess \neach residentโs need for: mobility, continence, and Activities of Daily \nLiving (โADLโ) support, activities that promote self care, seating supports, \nand meaningful activities.  Update the plan based on this assessment. \n3. \t provide furniture and seating supports adequate to permit residents to \ntransfer out of wheelchairs and so-called Geri-chairs (chairs on rollers, \nwith side-arm and other supports, intended for use by a geriatric \npopulation) to facilitate resident physical functionality. \n4. \t ensure that nurses and Nim Henson staff responsible for resident care are \ncompetent in: \na.\t identifying significant age-related changes; \nb.\t functional assessment and restorative care; \nc.\t basic elements of common pathology and physical assessment; \nd.\t medication effects and side effects; and \ne.\t facility policies and procedures regarding change of condition. \nF.   Psychiatric Care \nAs part of its obligation to provide its residents with adequate health care, Nim Henson \nshould provide its residents with adequate psychiatric supports and services.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396r(b)(4)(A). Nim Henson residents should receive psychotropic medications only after \nhaving been thoroughly evaluated and diagnosed according to current standards of care, \nincluding with sufficient documentation to withstand clinical scrutiny.  More particularly, Nim \nHenson should: \n1.\t obtain sufficient psychiatric services, consultative or otherwise, to meet \nthe ongoing psychiatric needs of Nim Hensonโs residents.  \n2.\t develop or procure standard psychological and psychiatric assessment and \ninterview protocols for reliably reaching a psychiatric diagnosis for    \nindividuals who are elderly.  Use these protocols to assess each person \nupon admission for possible psychiatric disorder(s). \n3.\t ensure that all staff directly interacting with residents display at least a \nbasic competence in providing appropriate supports for persons \nexperiencing depression and/or dementia. \n\n-20ยญ\n\n4.\t as to all residents receiving psychotropic medications, undertake a \npsychiatric consult to ensure that all such medications are appropriate and \nare specifically matched to current, clinically justifiable diagnoses. \n5.\t obtain informed consent or proper legal authorization prior to \nadministering psychotropic medications and other invasive treatments. \nG.  Incident Management and Quality Assurance \nIncidents involving injury and unusual incidents should be reliably and accurately \nreported and investigated, with appropriate follow-up.  More particularly, Nim Henson should: \n1.\t address the root causes of falls and other injuries to minimize their \noccurrence, and provide appropriate, individualized interventions. \n2.\t replace unwarranted use of full side rails with less harmful interventions \nfor falls. \n3.\t ensure that incidents involving injury and unusual incidents are tracked \nand analyzed to identify root causes. \n4.\t ensure that analyses are transmitted to the relevant disciplines and direct-\ncare areas for responsive action, and responses are monitored to ensure \nthat appropriate steps are taken. \n5.\t ensure that assessments are conducted to determine whether root causes \nhave been addressed and, if not, ensure that appropriate feedback is \nprovided to the responsible disciplines and direct-care areas. \nH.  Most Integrated Setting \nNim Henson should ensure that its treatment professionals periodically and reliably assess \nits residents to determine whether community placement is appropriate for any of them.  If \ntreatment in a more integrated setting is determined to be appropriate, then such treatment should \nbe provided, if the affected person does not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be \nreasonably accommodated. \n* * * * \nWe hope to work with the County in an amicable and cooperative fashion to resolve our \noutstanding concerns regarding Nim Henson. \nWe will forward our expert consultants' reports under separate cover.  Although their \nreports are their work - and do not necessarily represent the official conclusions of the \n\n-21ยญ\n\nDepartment of Justice - their observations, analyses and recommendations provide further \nelaboration of the relevant concerns, and offer practical assistance in addressing them.  We hope \nthat you will give this information careful consideration and that it will assist in facilitating a \ndialogue swiftly addressing areas requiring attention. \nIn the unexpected event that the parties are unable to reach a resolution regarding our \nconcerns, we are obligated to advise you that the Attorney General may initiate a lawsuit \npursuant to CRIPA, to correct deficiencies or to otherwise protect the rights of Nim Henson \nresidents, 49 days after the receipt of this letter.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1997b (a)(1).  Accordingly, we \nwill contact County officials soon to discuss in more detail the measures that the County must \ntake to address the deficiencies identified herein. \nSincerely, \nRalph F. Boyd, Jr.   \nAssistant Attorney General \ncc: \t Brendon Miller, Esq. \nBreathitt County Attorney \nMr. Philip Litteral \nAdministrator \nNim Henson Geriatric Center \nGregory F. Van Tatenhove \nUnited States Attorney for \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky ",

At  that \ntime  the  Parties may  agree  to  continue  or  terminate \nthis  settlement  agreement.  If the  Parties  do  not \nagree,  the  burden  shall be  on  DOJ  to  demonstrate  that \nDefendants  are  not  in  compliance  with  some  provision  of \nthis  settlement  agreement.
