    "summary": "<p>On January 15, 2009, the United States Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The United States sued South Carolina, as the owner and operator of the C.M. Tucker, Jr. Nursing Care Center, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. </p><p>The Department of Justice conducted an investigation of Tucker pursuant to CRIPA beginning in 2006. In a findings letter of May 6, 2008, the Department of Justice found that certain conditions and practices “substantially departed” from professionally accepted standards of care, exposing residents to significant harm and risk of harm and violating residents’ statutory and constitutional rights. Specifically, Tucker notably departed from professional standards of care in the development and review of healthcare plans; proper diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness and proper use of psychotropic medication; management of pain and suffering; safety and fall prevention; nutrition and hydration; and safe and sanitary living conditions. As a result of these deficiencies, Tucker residents “suffered preventable injuries, illnesses, and deaths.”</p><p>The findings letter described Tucker as an “atypical nursing facility” in that nearly all of its residents have one or more psychiatric diagnoses, many patients having previously been patients in the State psychiatric hospital system. The inadequate mental health care was found especially egregious considering the population at Tucker. Despite nearly all residents having one or more psychiatric disorders, only about half of residents had been appropriately assessed by psychiatrists. Further, the investigation found inadequate psychiatric staffing to meet the needs of the population. Psychoactive medication was used inappropriately, with little to no monitoring of dose, drug interactions, or adverse side effects. Tucker failed to address behavioral issues in an organized fashion, and the inadequate behavioral programming was considered an “especially acute deficiency” given the high percentage of Tucker residents with psychiatric diagnoses exhibiting behavior problems. </p><p>Further, Tucker Center failed to properly conduct assessments to ensure that residents were receiving treatment, supports and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The investigation identified residents who had not been evaluated for lower levels of care and possible community placement, finding that there “should be more people ready for community placement.”  </p><p>The findings letter set out minimal remedial actions to remedy the deficiencies, invited the state to address the issues, and alerted the state to the possibility of a CRIPA lawsuit brought by the United States to compel remedial action. While the Department of Justice indicated that the facility had begun to take some remedial steps, it filed its complaint and the parties jointly moved for settlement the day the complaint was filed. </p><p>The parties entered a Memorandum of Agreement and moved to conditionally dismiss the action, conditioned upon the Tucker Center achieving substantial compliance with the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement. The Agreement’s contained substantive requirements addressing: 1) timely assessments and care planning; 2) nutrition and hydration care and aspiration prevention; 3) mental health assessments, psychiatrist staffing to ensure adequate psychiatric services, and proper use of psychoactive medications; 4) pressure sore prevention and treatment measures; 5) pain management and end-of-life care; 6) fall prevention and protection from other harm; 7) meaningful activity programming; 8) environmental conditions, improving food services, laundry sanitation, housekeeping, and infection control; and 9) serving residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to residents’ needs. </p><p>District Judge Matthew J. Perry approved the terms of the agreement and conditionally dismissed the case on February 17, 2009. The Department of Justice monitored South Carolina’s compliance with the requirements of the Memorandum of Agreement, and the court retained jurisdiction over the implementation and enforcement of the measures for two years.</p><p>On February 15, 2011, Judge Perry finalized and closed the settlement. The case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

      "title": "CRIPA Investigation of C.M. Tucker, Jr., Nursing Care Center in Columbia, South Carolina",
      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - RFK \nWashington, DC  20530 \nMay 6, 2008 \nThe Honorable Mark Sanford \nGovernor of South Carolina \nOffice of the Governor \n1100 Gervais Street \nColumbia, SC  29201 \nRe:\t CRIPA Investigation of C.M. Tucker, Jr., Nursing Care\nCenter in Columbia, South Carolina \nDear Governor Sanford: \nI write to report the findings of the Civil Rights\nDivision’s investigation of conditions and practices at the C.M.\nTucker, Jr., Nursing Care Center (“Tucker” or “the facility”) in\nColumbia, South Carolina.  On July 25, 2006, we notified you of\nour intent to conduct an investigation of Tucker pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"),\n42 U.S.C. § 1997.  As we noted, CRIPA gives the Department of\nJustice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of\nconduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory\nrights of nursing home residents who are served in public\ninstitutions. \nIn November and December 2006, we conducted on-site\ninspections of Tucker with expert consultants in the areas of\nprotection from harm, environmental health and safety, geriatric\nmedicine, psychiatry, and nursing.  Before, during, and after our\nsite visits, we reviewed a wide variety of relevant facility\ndocuments, including policies and procedures, and other records\nrelating to the care and treatment of Tucker residents.  During\nour visits, we also interviewed Tucker administrators,\nprofessionals, staff, and residents.  In keeping with our pledge\nto share information and to provide technical assistance where \n\n- 2 -\n\nappropriate, we conveyed our preliminary findings to counsel for\nthe South Carolina Department of Mental Health (“SCDMH”) and\nTucker administrators and staff at the close of each of our on-\nsite visits.1 \nAt the outset, we would like to express our appreciation to\nthe State of South Carolina (“State”) and to Tucker staff and\nadministration for their complete cooperation and assistance\nthroughout our investigation.  We are confident that this \ncooperative relationship will help ensure an efficient resolution\nto this investigation. \nConsistent with the statutory requirements of CRIPA, we now\nwrite to advise you of the findings of our investigation, the\nfacts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are\nnecessary to remedy the deficiencies we have identified.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997b.  As described more fully below, we conclude\nthat numerous conditions and practices at Tucker violate the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of its residents.  In \nparticular, we find that residents of Tucker suffer significant\nharm and risk of harm due to inadequate nursing, medical, and\nmental health care; inadequate nutrition and hydration;\ninadequate behavioral programming; inadequate medical and nursing\ndocumentation; inadequate protection from harm; inadequate\nactivities; failure to serve residents in the most integrated\nsetting; and inadequate sanitation.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU.S. 307 (1982); Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1395, 1396r, and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483\nSubpart B (Medicaid and Medicare Program Provisions).  As a \nresult of these deficiencies, Tucker residents have suffered\npreventable injuries, illnesses, and deaths.  In addition, we\nfind that the State fails to provide services to certain Tucker\nresidents in the most integrated setting, as required by the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et\nseq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S.\n581 (1999). \nI.  BACKGROUND \nTucker is a public nursing home operated by SCDMH.  Tucker \nprovides long term care to persons who have been approved by the\nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Regional\nOffice, and approved by an Admissions Committee based on \n1  In addition, we re-visited Tucker, without experts, in\nSeptember 2007, for the purpose of introducing additional DOJ\nstaff to facility officials. \n\n- 3 -\n\nestablished criteria for skilled and intermediate nursing care.\nWhile the population is currently approximately 400 persons, the\nfacility is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (“CMS”) to serve up to 560 residents.  Tucker includes \nthree pavilions which are located on a campus in downtown\nColumbia.  The John M. Fewell Pavilion (“Fewell Pavilion”) opened\nin 1970; the E. Roy Stone Veterans’ Pavilion (“Stone Pavilion”)\nopened in 1971; and the Frank L. Roddey Pavilion (“Roddey\nPavilion”) opened in 1983.  The facility has two separate\nlicensures under Medicare:  one for the Roddey Pavilion and one\nfor the Fewell and Stone Pavilions, collectively.  Stone Pavilion \nprimarily serves veterans.  Tucker is an atypical nursing\nfacility in that nearly all of its residents have one or more\npsychiatric diagnoses.  Tucker is the nursing home of last resort\nfor hundreds of patients with long-term psychiatric illnesses.\nMany Tucker residents were previously patients in the State\npsychiatric hospital system. \nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  INADEQUATE NURSING, MEDICAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE \nAt issue is whether the State is providing Tucker residents\nwith care and treatment in accordance with its constitutional and \nfederal statutory obligations.  Residents of publicly-operated\ninstitutions, such as Tucker, have a Fourteenth Amendment due\nprocess right to adequate health care.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n315 (adequate medical care required in institutions housing\nindividuals with developmental disabilities); Patten v. Nichols,\n274 F.3d 829, 842 (4th Cir. 2001) (Youngberg establishes right to\nadequate medical care in institution for individuals with mental\nillness); Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178, 1187 (W.D.\nN.C. 1988), aff’d 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990)(finding breach of\nprofessional standards where state failed to periodically monitor\nadverse side effects of medication). \nFederal regulations specify the generally accepted\nprofessional standards for health care in nursing homes.2 \nFederal regulations require that each resident of a nursing home\nhas a right to “necessary care and services to attain or maintain\nthe highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-\nbeing in accordance with a comprehensive assessment and plan of \n2  Generally accepted professional standards include those\npromulgated by the National Hospice and Palliative Care\nOrganization, the American Cancer Society, and the American\nGeriatrics Society. \n\n- 4 -\n\ncare.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.25.  Residents also have the right to an\non-going re-evaluation of their health conditions.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.20.  Generally accepted professional standards require that\nlicensed physicians and nurses understand the basic principles of\nmedicine applicable to the population they serve.  As such,\nprofessionals at Tucker have a responsibility to understand the\nunique diagnostic and treatment requirements of geriatric\nresidents. \nTucker fails to provide residents with adequate nursing,\nmedical, and mental health care, including psychiatric services.\nOur investigation revealed that these deficiencies have resulted\nin harm and, in some cases, death to residents.  In each area,\nthe care provided at Tucker substantially departs from generally\naccepted professional standards of practice and federal\nregulations.  Specifically, Tucker fails to:  a) provide adequate\nmental health assessments and diagnoses; b) provide adequate\ntreatment for dysphagia; c) provide and monitor adequate and\nappropriate pharmacotherapy, including psychoactive medication;\nd) provide adequate psychiatric services; f) provide adequate\ntreatment for pressure sores; g) provide adequate palliative and\nend-of-life care; and h) conduct adequate death reviews.  These \ndeficiencies place residents’ health in serious jeopardy. \n1.  Inadequate Mental Health Assessment and Diagnosis \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require nursing homes to establish a comprehensive care\nplan for each resident that specifically addresses individualized\nneeds, including mental health needs.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20.\nAssessments must be conducted upon admission and periodically\nthereafter to ensure that there is a comprehensive, accurate, and\nstandardized record of each resident’s functional capacity.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20; see also In re Involuntary Discharge or\nTransfer of J.S., 512 N.W.2d 604, 609 (Minn. Ct. App. 1994) (“A\nnursing facility must initially and periodically conduct a\ncomprehensive assessment of each resident’s functional\ncapacity.”).  These assessments are then used by staff to develop\na comprehensive care plan specific to the needs of each resident.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(a)(1).  Adequate assessments include\nmeasurable objectives and timetables to assist the clinical and\nmental health staff in ensuring that all of the residents’ needs\nare met in a timely manner.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20(k)(i).\nPhysicians are required by federal regulations to take an active\nrole in the care of each resident by reviewing, at each visit,\nthe resident’s total program of care, including medications and\ntreatments.  42 C.F.R. § 483.40(b).  The care plan must be \n\n- 5 -\n\nperiodically reviewed and revised, using the results of the\nresident’s regular assessments, to assure continued accuracy.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(k)(2)(iii).\n Nursing homes must provide resident-centered services which\nare individually tailored to meet the needs of each resident.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.25.  In order for this to successfully occur and\nbe consistently maintained, interdisciplinary teams must know\neach resident’s strengths, ambitions, preferences, and needs.\nThis knowledge requires a relationship with the resident, annual\nassessments of the resident’s status, and a plan of care which is\nproactively responsive to the resident’s changing needs.  Among\nother things, the plan should describe the services to be\nfurnished in order to provide the resident with “the highest\npracticable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being ...”\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(k)(1)(i). \nWe found that Tucker fails to adequately assess and care for\nresidents’ individual needs.  This is especially evident in the\nlack of adequate assessment of mental illness.  This issue is of \ngreat concern because, remarkably, nearly all residents whose\ncharts we reviewed were noted to have one or more psychiatric\ndiagnoses.  This is far in excess of what is expected in a\ntypical nursing home, but not completely unexpected in a nursing\nhome such as Tucker that is a residence of last resort for \nhundreds of residents with long-term psychiatric illnesses. \nWe found that only approximately 50 percent of Tucker\nresidents had been appropriately assessed by psychiatrists,\ndespite the fact that nearly 100 percent of residents have one or\nmore psychiatric diagnoses.  A significant number of residents at\nTucker were diagnosed with non-specific psychiatric illnesses,\nsuch as “psychosis not otherwise specified,” “unspecified non-\npsychotic mental disorder,” and, in one particularly egregious\nexample, “organic brain syndrome,” a diagnosis universally\nconsidered to be outdated and too non-specific to be meaningful.\nA non-specific diagnosis frequently leads to incorrect treatment\nwhich, in turn, can lead to serious injury or death. \n2.  Inadequate Treatment for Dysphagia \nGenerally accepted professional standards for the evaluation\nof dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing, commonly seen in nursing\nhome residents)3 include an assessment of the resident’s ability \n3  Dysphagia is often caused by strokes, neurodegenerative\nconditions, and diseases of the esophagus, but can also be a \n\n- 6 -\n\nto chew food, drink fluids, and swallow safely.  If dysphagia is\npresent, nursing homes must provide appropriately textured foods\nand other necessary interventions to protect the resident from\nchoking hazards, malnutrition, and dehydration. \nWe found a high prevalence of swallowing disorders at\nTucker.  We found a pattern of residents experiencing dysphagia\nfor a long period before their symptoms were identified or\naddressed.  We found that Tucker’s nursing staff fail to\nrecognize critical changes in residents’ medical status, such as\nsignificant weight loss, malnutrition, and dehydration, in a\ntimely manner.  We also found that Tucker’s nursing staff fail to\nalert attending physicians so that treatment options can be\ntimely considered.  Both doctors and nurses fail to follow up on\nrequired health care interventions to determine whether they are\nimplemented and effective.  This failure places residents at risk\nof serious, even life-threatening, harm.  For example: \n•\t A.A., a 59-year-old man suffering from dysphagia, showed\nsymptoms of significant weight loss and swallowing\ndifficulties.4  His physician ordered a swallowing analysis,\nbut no evaluation was completed for two months.  In that \nperiod, A.A. continued to receive food in a texture and\nconsistency that he was unable to chew and ingest safely.\nOn the day after the swallowing evaluation, which determined\nthat he needed to have pureed food and thickened liquids,\nA.A. was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia5 at the local \nhospital, and died four weeks later.  His inadequately and\nuntimely assessed swallowing problems, improper diet, and\nuntreated loss of 20% of his body weight over a four month\nperiod may have contributed to his death by depriving him of\na safe method by which to eat, the muscle strength and \nsecondary result of side effects of medications, particularly\npsychotherapeutic medications, as well as by malnutrition and\ndehydration. \n4  Throughout this letter, we refer to Tucker residents by\ninitials.  To protect their privacy, we have changed their\ninitials.  We will provide a key to the residents’ actual names\nunder separate cover. \n5  Aspiration pneumonia is a lung infection caused by\ninhaling foreign particles, usually food or liquids, into the\nlungs.  Aspiration pneumonia is often caused by a compromised\nswallowing mechanism common among elderly people and people\nsuffering from neurological disorders or injury, such as stroke. \n\n- 7 -\nstamina needed to adequately chew and swallow safely, and,\nultimately, the ability to cough effectively to clear his\nlungs and recover from the aspiration pneumonia. \n•\t Similarly, it took four weeks after a doctor’s order to\nconduct A.B.’s swallow evaluation.  During that period, no\nnurses charted any progress notes regarding A.B.’s\nswallowing problems, even after the physician identified\nthem.  When it was finally conducted, the swallow study\nrecommended that thickened liquids would be safer for him to\nswallow than textured or pureed foods.  However, nursing\nstaff failed to monitor whether he consumed the thickened \nfluids.  Shortly thereafter, A.B.’s laboratory tests\nrevealed severe dehydration that would not likely have\noccurred if he had consumed sufficient fluids.  A.B. died \none month later of aspiration pneumonia. \n•\t Resident A.C. was supposed to receive thickened liquids\npursuant to a diet order, but apparently did not receive\nthem.  Laboratory tests verified that A.C. was dehydrated.\nFor four days after receiving the lab results, licensed\nnurses failed to enter any information about A.C.’s\ndehydration on his chart.  A.C. was sent to the hospital in\ncritical condition, and died four days later. \n3.  Inappropriate Use of Psychoactive Medication \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require that nursing home residents be free from\nunnecessary drugs, which are defined as any drug that is used in\nan excessive dose, for an excessive duration, without adequate\nindications for its use, without adequate monitoring, or in the\npresence of adverse consequences indicating that the dose should\nbe reduced or discontinued.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(1); see also,\nTalbot v. Lucy Corr Nursing Home, 118 F.3d. 215 (4th Cir. 1997).\nWith respect to psychoactive drugs, Tucker must ensure that\nresidents who have not previously used psychoactive drugs are not\ngiven them unless the drugs are necessary to treat a diagnosed\nand documented condition.  The regulation also requires that\nresidents taking psychoactive drugs receive gradual dose\nreductions and behavioral interventions in an effort to \ndiscontinue the drugs, unless clinically contraindicated.  Id. \nWe found that the psychoactive medication practices at\nTucker substantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards.  In our review, we found that there was very little\nindication in the records that medical providers and nurses\nactually considered psychoactive drug side effects in evaluating \n\n- 8 -\n\nresidents’ changed conditions.  We reviewed several charts where \nthe relationship between increases in psychoactive drug dosages\nand changed clinical condition was obvious, yet nurses failed to\ndocument any observations or assessments after the dose was\nchanged.  Notably, Tucker was cited for deficiencies under this\nregulation in the September 21, 2006 survey conducted by the\nCenters for Medicaid/Medicare Services (“CMS”). \nWe also found numerous instances where residents were \nprescribed psychoactive drugs absent an appropriate psychiatric\ndiagnosis, where no apparent effort had been made at dose\nreduction, and where little or no monitoring had been undertaken\nof the appropriateness of the dose, drug interactions, or\nadverse side effects.  For example: \n•\t Resident A.D. was diagnosed with hypotension (low blood\npressure) and was known to have a history of falls.  She was \nprescribed a high dose of a psychoactive drug that,\naccording to our expert consultant, should never be used in\nthe geriatric population because it can cause orthostatic\nhypotension,6 a major cause of falls in the geriatric\npopulation.  Despite A.D.’s medical history and history of\nfalls, she was administered this drug for over two years.\nIn addition, there was no evidence in A.D.’s chart that any\nefforts were made to reduce the dosage, as required by\nfederal regulations. \n•\t Resident A.E. was on two psychoactive drugs for over one\nyear without adequate monitoring for side effects.  We found \nno evidence of attempts to reduce or eliminate these drugs.\nThe medications, when used together, can cause serious side\neffects, including severe agitation. \n•\t Residents A.F., A.G., and A.D. were given antidepressants\nwith no diagnoses of depression.  In resident A.D.’s case,\nthe antidepressant was prescribed for sleep, which,\naccording to our expert, is an inappropriate use of this\npowerful drug. \n•\t At Tucker, anticonvulsants are routinely prescribed as mood\nstabilizers, psychoactives to control anxiety, and\nantidepressants for sleep problems, often without a clear\nrationale, and thus inappropriately. \n6  Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden temporary drop in\nblood pressure upon standing up, and is common in elderly people. \n\n- 9 -\n\n•\t The psychoactive drug Seroquel is widely prescribed at\nTucker, even for diabetic residents who are having problems\ncontrolling their blood sugar; a well-known side effect of\nSeroquel is to raise blood sugar levels. \n4. \t  Inadequate Psychiatric Services \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require nursing homes to provide sufficient specialized\nservices, including psychiatric services, to meet the needs of\nresidents with mental health problems.  42 C.F.R. § 483.45;\nOr. Advocacy Ctr. V. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003);\nsee also, Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2000).\nWe found that Tucker does not provide adequate psychiatric\nservices to its residents. \nWe found that Tucker residents are not receiving psychiatric\nconsultations on a timely basis.  Moreover, when residents do\nreceive psychiatric consultations, it typically takes up to two\nweeks for the recommendations resulting from the consultations to\nbe implemented in residents’ treatment plans.  The generally\naccepted professional standard of care requires response to\nrecommendations within 24 hours.  Similarly, psychiatrists’ notes\nare often not placed in the resident’s chart for up to two weeks;\nthe generally accepted professional standard dictates that the\npsychiatrist’s note be placed in the chart immediately following\nthe evaluation.  These deficiencies create a serious risk of harm \nfor residents, as, during the significant period of delay, the\nresident is receiving no mental health treatment, or inadequate\ntreatment. \nIn addition, our expert noted that, at the time of the tour,\nTucker did not provide psychiatric staffing adequate to meet the\nneeds of its population.  The clinical psychiatric staffing level\nat the time of our tour was limited to 12 hours per week.  This \ninsufficient staffing translates to only one brief visit every\nthree months, per resident, which is grossly inadequate.  We \nunderstand that Tucker intends to increase staffing by the\naddition of a psychiatric resident and/or fellow rotating through\nTucker.  Even this additional proposed psychiatric staffing is\ninsufficient.  Tucker needs one or more additional full-time \nequivalent psychiatrist positions. \n5.  Inadequate Treatment for Pressure Sores \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require that nursing homes ensure that “[a] resident\nwho enters the facility without pressure sores does not develop \n\n- 10 -\n\npressure sores unless the individual’s clinical condition\ndemonstrates that they were unavoidable.”  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(c)(1); see also, Crestview Parke Care Center v.\nThompson, 373 F.3d 743, 745 (6th Cir. 2004).  Federal regulations\nand generally accepted professional standards also require Tucker\nto take steps to prevent and treat pressure sores, including\nkeeping the resident’s skin clean and dry, monitoring the\ncondition of the skin to detect the earliest sign of a pressure\ninjury, and repositioning the resident at regular intervals.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.25(c).  With proper attention, most pressure\ninjuries are widely considered to be avoidable. \nWe found that Tucker substantially departs from the standard\nof care for avoiding pressure sores.  Several Tucker residents \nsuffered severe stage IV pressure sores7 that should have been \nprevented with appropriate care, including regularly turning and\nre-positioning the resident. \nFor example, one week after a resident A.H. began treatment\nwith 5 mg. of Haldol (the maximum dosage recommended in long term\ncare facilities is 3 mg. per day), he developed a stage II\npressure sore that progressed to a stage IV sore that took six\nmore months to heal.  It is likely that medical staff did not\nrecognize that this resident’s mobility was impaired by the\nsedating effect of the high dose of Haldol, and therefore did not\nreposition him sufficiently to avoid the pressure sore. \nWe understand that Tucker is beginning to make improvements\nto prevent and treat pressure sores with pressure-relieving beds\nand by hiring a full-time certified wound-ostomy-continence\nnurse.  These steps are commendable. \n6.  Inadequate Palliative and End-of-Life Care \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require nursing homes to assess residents for pain as\npart of the comprehensive care planning process.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.20(d).  Generally accepted professional standards of care\nfor the management of pain and other distressing symptoms at the\nend-of-life include:  development of an educational program for \n7  Pressure sores are labeled in four stages that relate\nto their depth.  Stage I represents the most superficial pressure\ninjury, whereas stage IV represents a full thickness skin loss\nwith damage extending into muscle, tendon or bone.  Full \nthickness pressure sores, stages III and IV, take months to heal\nor may never heal. \n\n- 11 -\n\nnurses and other medical care providers with an emphasis on pain\nassessment and treatment; use of standardized pain assessment\ntools; familiarity with opiate drug dosing and titration; use of\npalliative interventions, particularly medications, for treatment\nof such end-of-life symptoms as nausea, anxiety, and delirium;\nand, a focus on symptom management. \nTucker residents are not adequately treated for pain and\nend-of-life symptoms.  Orders for pain medication, nausea\ncontrol, and terminal agitation/anxiety medications were absent\nor inadequate in a majority of the cases reviewed.  Tucker \nmedical staff appear to lack knowledge of basic end-of-life\nmanagement principles.  In one egregious case, as a result of\ninadequate pain medication, a resident was found “groaning, in\nthe fetal position” as death approached.  Another resident, dying\nof metastatic colon cancer, vomited blood several times in the\nhours before his death, but no nausea medication was requested by\nthe nurse on duty.  Moreover, even though a tranquilizer had been\nordered for this resident, it was not administered, a violation\nof generally accepted professional standards. \n7.   Inadequate Death Reviews \nGenerally accepted professional standards dictate that\nhealthcare facilities typically conduct management reviews of\ncare whenever a resident dies in order to analyze the adequacy of\ncare provided and to develop strategies to improve medical\nperformance in future cases.  Tucker mortality reviews,\nconducted by a nurse practitioner, are inadequate and do not\nuncover quality of care problems that need to be addressed.  In \nour sample of 12 reviews, not one review found any contributory\ndeficiencies of health care.  However, there were several\ninstances where we found that care was deficient.  For example,\nresident A.I. died, after being transferred to an acute care\nhospital, from complications of an infected, dislodged\ngastrostomy feeding tube.  During the four days prior to his\nhospitalization, Tucker staff failed to assess whether the tube\nwas properly placed, even though there was obvious leakage from\nthe site of the incision and redness had been present for the\nprior 11 days.  Infection of the G-tube site likely contributed\nto the resident’s death.  If Tucker medical staff had properly\nassessed this resident’s condition when leaking was first\nobserved, steps could have been taken to treat the problem.  The \ndeath review of this case did not comment on the lack of \nassessments of the G-tube site. \n\n- 12 -\n\nAdditional death reviews that we read similarly failed to\nidentify basic care deficits such as the absence of licensed\nnurse charting for many days prior to a resident being\n“discovered” to be critically ill, hospitalized, and dying within\na period of days.  In many cases, resident records reflect that\nnurses failed to assess residents prior to sending them to the\nhospital.  These failures were not identified by the death\nreviews or raised as issues to be addressed in medical staff \nmeetings.  The following examples illustrate these deficiencies: \n•\t Resident A.C. was admitted to a local hospital intensive\ncare unit from Tucker in critical condition from sepsis8 and \naspiration pneumonia.  Tucker documents indicate that A.C. \nwas not receiving thickened liquids to assist in proper\nhydration.  A.C.’s condition appears to have worsened,\nthough during A.C.’s last four days at Tucker, nurses\napparently charted nothing regarding A.C.’s clinical\ncondition.  A.C. was subsequently sent to an emergency room\nwithout explanation, and died four days later. \n•\t According to Tucker records, A.J. was sent from Tucker to a\nlocal hospital due to “acute onset of dyspnea.”9 \nUltimately, the hospital concluded that A.J. suffered from\nacute respiratory failure from sepsis.  A.J. died less than \n24 hours after transfer from Tucker.  Our review of Tucker’s \nrecords did not yield evidence that Tucker staff adequately\nidentified, diagnosed, or treated A.J.’s sepsis.\nAccordingly, the hospital’s discovery of A.J.’s condition\nwas too late to preserve A.J.’s life. \nIn a number of the charts of deceased residents that we \nreviewed, the death certificate did not accurately reflect the\ncause of the resident’s death.  One Tucker physician told us that\nbecause information about the actual deaths at the local hospital\nwas unavailable to him, he bases his certification of the death\non his general knowledge of the resident.  We noted two Tucker \n8  Sepsis is a medical term used to describe infection.\nWhile most cases of sepsis are treatable, if unchecked, sepsis\ncan be fatal. \n9  Dyspnea is a term that generally identifies the symptom\nof shortness of breath, and is often the product of another\nillness. \n\n- 13 -\n\ndeaths certified to be from “inanition”10 from end stage\nAlzheimer’s disease, one after only three weeks in Tucker\nresidence and the other from septic shock.  In neither case was \nthere documentation that those residents had Alzheimer’s or that \nthey had regressed severely as implied by the term inanition.\nTucker’s failure to accurately determine the cause of its\nresidents’ deaths limits its ability to adequately evaluate how\nTucker’s health care services addressed the condition that caused \nthe death. \nB.  INADEQUATE NUTRITION AND HYDRATION \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards of care require that adequate food and fluids be\nprovided to nursing home residents.  Federal regulations require\nthat the facility provide each resident with “a nourishing,\npalatable, well-balanced diet that meets daily nutritional and\nspecial dietary needs of each resident.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.35.\nRegulations also require “sufficient fluid intake to maintain\nproper hydration and health.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(j). \nOur review found that Tucker residents do not consistently\nreceive appropriate therapeutic diets.  Nurses do not verify diet\norders with the physician’s order; ensure that proper diets are\nserved;11 or accurately chart meal consumption.  For example,\nresident A.C. should have received thickened liquids, but the\ndietitian observed that he was not receiving them.  For four \ndays, no licensed nurse charted any notes about his condition or\nmeals.  Laboratory tests showed that he became dehydrated, likely\nbecause he could not swallow unthickened liquids.  He was \nhospitalized in critical condition with sepsis (a system-wide\ninfection) and aspiration pneumonia, and died four days later. \nAt Tucker, nursing assistants are responsible for providing\nnutritional supplements and charting their consumption, but fail\nto do so on a regular basis.  Tucker’s systemic failure to\ndocument true consumption of meals, fluids, and supplements was\nobserved in every unit during our visit.  Nursing personnel\nroutinely fail to assess for basic health issues, such as weight\nloss and diet, and do not consistently bring such concerns to the\nattention of physicians.  As a result of these practices, Tucker \n10  Inanition refers to pronounced weakness, extreme weight\nloss, and decreased metabolism due to prolonged severe\ninsufficiency of food (starvation). \n11  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(i),(j). \n\n- 14 -\n\nresidents have experienced avoidable episodes of malnutrition and\ndehydration that frequently have resulted in serious outcomes,\noften including the placement of feeding tubes that otherwise\nwould not have been necessary. \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require that facilities provide sufficient fluids to\nmaintain proper health and hydration.12  At Tucker, dietitians do\nnot adequately calculate residents’ fluid needs and communicate\nthat information to nursing staff.  Tucker’s nurses do not \nadequately monitor residents’ hydration status.  In some cases,\nneither the dietitians nor the nurses recognized that the\nresident was at risk for dehydration.  One resident, who\nexperienced weight loss, dysphagia, and recurring urinary tract\ninfections over a three month period, had no chart notes on her\nfluid consumption for three days.  The next day, she was\nhospitalized and found to be severely dehydrated with a fluid\ndeficit of over six liters.  In every record we reviewed related\nto hydration problems, nurses charted inaccurately that adequate\nfluids were consumed.13  In most of these cases, there was no\ndocumentation that the physician was alerted to any possible\ndehydration problem. \nGenerally accepted professional standards to address weight\nloss require an evaluation of the resident, looking at potential\ndisease processes, functional problems, and medication side\neffects.  Tucker’s failure to evaluate weight loss for possible\nunderlying and potentially remediable causes places residents at\nrisk of harm.  For example, A.K., a resident who had previously\nbeen diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis (“TB”), experienced a\n15 lb. weight loss during a two month period in which he was\ntreated three times for a respiratory infection.  Despite the\nhistory of TB, no chest x-rays were done.  His weight loss was\nnot addressed by his medical caregivers.  He was then \nhospitalized, diagnosed with an active case of TB, and died.  Had \nhis staff completed an adequate case review and analysis of his\nweight loss, it is probable that the diagnosis of active TB would\nhave been made sooner, possibly averting his death from a\ntreatable condition. \n12  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(j). \n13  If adequate fluids were consumed, dehydration would not\noccur. \n\n- 15 -\n\nWe also found examples in which residents who were losing\nweight were not seen by the dietician for four to six weeks.  In \none egregious case, resident A.L., who had experienced weight\nloss, was not seen by a dietician for nearly seven weeks.\nAccording to our consultant, the generally accepted professional\nstandard of care for residents experiencing weight loss is to\nhave the dietician’s input in assessing the nutritional problem,\nas well as to assist in the ongoing care.  This requires that,\nfor residents in the acute phase of significant weight loss, a\ndietician see the resident weekly or bi-weekly, with a reduction\nin frequency once the resident stabilizes. \nC.\t INADEQUATE BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMMING \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards require that nursing homes provide adequate treatment\nand services to correct an assessed difficulty with mental or\npsychological adjustment.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(f).  Nursing homes\nare also required to provide behavioral interventions for\nresidents using psychoactive drugs.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(l).  We \nfound that the behavioral program at Tucker is inadequate and\nsubstantially departs from generally accepted professional\nstandards.  This deficiency is especially acute given the high\npercentage of residents with psychiatric diagnoses who are\nexhibiting behavior problems at Tucker. \nTucker does not have a formal behavioral program.  Although\nthere are two full-time psychologists available, it does not\nappear that Tucker addresses behavioral issues in an organized\nfashion.  For example, there appears to be no formal behavior\nprogram for residents diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, placing\nresidents at heightened risk for the use of physical or chemical\nrestraints to control behavior, and placing them at heightened\nrisk of physical assault by other residents who may become\nfrustrated at their repetitive speech or wandering.  The \nfollowing example illustrates the inadequacy of the behavioral\nsupport program at Tucker: \n•\t Resident A.M. has a documented history of attempting to\nswallow non-food items.  Accordingly, A.M. was placed under\na one-on-one intensive staffing assignment during a\nparticular course of scalp treatment that required her to\nwear a plastic shower cap.  Reportedly, A.M. had tried\nseveral times to take the shower cap off her head and\nswallow it.  Despite A.M.’s clear risk of choking, Tucker \n\n- 16 -\n\ndid not assess A.M. for pica14 and did not provide her with\na behavioral support to help ensure her safety in the\nfuture.  Moreover, the one-on-one intensive staffing\nassignment ended as soon as A.M.’s scalp treatment was over,\nleaving A.M. exposed to further risks of her pica condition. \nD.  INADEQUATE MEDICAL AND NURSING DOCUMENTATION \nTucker fails to ensure that residents’ medical records \ncompletely and accurately reflect their care.  This is a \nsubstantial departure from federal regulations and generally\naccepted professional standards.  Federal regulations require\nthat clinical records be complete, accurately documented, readily\naccessible, and systematically organized.  42 C.F.R. § 483.75(l);\nid. at § 483.20.  The records should be sufficiently detailed to\nprovide for continuity of care.  Our investigation revealed\nnumerous instances of inadequate or absent documentation by\nmedical and nursing staff, leading to harm or the risk of harm to\nTucker residents. \nFor example, we found a widespread pattern of omissions\nwhere documentation of nutritional supplementation was concerned.\nOur nurse consultant reviewed 15 resident charts that lacked \ndocumentation that such nutrition was ever provided, even though\nit had been ordered by the physician, including the charts of\nresidents A.M., A.N., A.O., A.P., A.Q., A.R., A.S., A.T., A.U.,\nA.V., A.A., A.W., A.X., A.B., and A.Y.  Our physician consultant\nfurther noted that in all cases reviewed where residents were \nsubsequently determined to have severe dehydration, documentation\nin the chart inaccurately reflected that fluid intake had been\nadequate. Clearly, the failure to provide nutritional supplements\ncreates an unreasonable risk of harm by creating or exacerbating\nweight loss and, as noted above, deaths due to inadequate\nnutrition and hydration have been documented at Tucker.\nAccording to our physician consultant, either nursing assistants\nare not charting truthfully, or are not being adequately\nsupervised by licensed staff. \nIn addition, we found multiple examples where the record\nindicated that residents had not been given full baths or sponge\nbaths over a one week period.  Nursing staff indicated that the\npractice at Tucker was to bathe residents twice a week, but when \n14  Pica is the medical term for eating substances that\nare non-nutritive (e.g. pencils, glass, and plastic).  While \ncommonly seen in young children, pica may be of particular\nconcern in adults, especially among seniors. \n\n- 17 -\nasked for documentation of this in the medical record, nurses\nwere unable to find the required documentation. \nWe found that, in addition to lapses in completing medical\nrecords, Tucker also failed to provide training on the importance\nof record-keeping to staff.  We learned that only 176 out of\napproximately 250 nursing assistants at Tucker had been trained\non the use of a newly revised form being used in residents’\ncharts. \nE.  INADEQUATE PROTECTION FROM HARM \nTucker residents have a right to “conditions of reasonable\ncare and safety.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.  Applicable\nMedicaid regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards dictate that a “resident has the right to be free from\nverbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, corporal punishment,\nand involuntary seclusion.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(b).  The facility\nmust “develop and implement written policies and procedures that\nprohibit mistreatment, neglect, and abuse of residents and\nmisappropriation of resident property.”  Id. at § 483.13(c).\nFinally, a critical component in a system to keep residents safe\nis an effective incident management system for reporting and\ninvestigating incidents involving injuries to residents, tracking\nand trending these incidents, and implementing and monitoring\ncorrective action to avoid future incidents.  Id. at § 483.13\n(c)(2),(3).  Specifically, this regulation states that the\nfacility must: \nensure that all alleged violations involving\nmistreatment, neglect, or abuse, including injuries of\nunknown source, and misappropriation of resident\nproperty are reported immediately to the administrator\nof the facility and to other officials... [and] must\nhave evidence that all alleged violations are\nthoroughly investigated, and must prevent further\npotential abuse while the investigation is in progress. \nId. \nTucker residents are not adequately protected from harm.  In \nparticular, Tucker fails to:  (1) protect residents from injury\ndue to falls; (2) monitor and control use of certain restraints;\n(3) protect residents from abuse and neglect and investigate\nthose incidents that do occur; and (4) employ appropriate quality\nassurance to monitor all these areas. \n\n- 18 -\n1.  Lack of an Adequate Fall Prevention Program \nTucker staff fail to protect residents adequately from the\nrisk of falling.  The injuries that can result from falls,\nparticularly fractures, pose a serious risk to elderly persons.\nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional standards\nrequire nursing homes to assess residents for risk of falls, make\nappropriate diagnoses related to fall risk, develop appropriate\ncare plans to mitigate risk of falls, and supervise residents\nadequately to protect them from falling.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(h);\n483.20(a-k); accord, Asbury Center v. U.S. Dept. of HHSCMM, 77\nFed.Appx. 853, 2003 WL 22290204 (6th Cir. 2003) (unreported). \nThere were 278 falls reported at Tucker in the six months of\ndata provided prior to our tour.  Although Tucker policy does not\nspecifically define a “fall,” Tucker’s interpretation appears to\nbe appropriate and includes circumstances in which a resident\nfalls out of bed, is pushed to the floor by a peer, is found on\nthe floor without staff directly observing how he or she got\nthere, or deliberately seats him or herself on the floor. \nOf the 278 falls recorded by Tucker staff, 183 of them, or\n66 percent, were not witnessed by staff.  On 10 of the living\nunits we reviewed, at least 75 percent of residents’ falls were\nnot witnessed.  In five of those units, every fall went \nunwitnessed.  The high percentage of unwitnessed falls at Tucker\nis alarming, and reflects an unacceptable lack of supervision.\nMoreover, many of the falls resulted in significant injuries.\nFor example: \n•\t A.Z. was found lying on a hallway floor, complaining of\nright leg pain.  It was discovered that he had a fractured \nright hip. \n•\t B.A. was found on the floor in the doorway of his room.  He \nhad been complaining of leg pain since the previous day.\nB.A. suffered a fractured right lower leg. \n•\t A.N. was found lying face-down on the floor.  She sustained \na two and a quarter inch cut requiring six sutures above her\neye. \n•\t B.B. was also found lying face-down on the floor with a pool\nof blood around her head.  She sustained a left shoulder \ndislocation and a wound to her head. \n\n- 19 -\n\n•\t B.C. was discovered to have a fractured right ankle after\nbeing found on the floor and complaining of right ankle\npain.  The origin was never determined. \n•\t A.J. was found on the floor in a peer’s room with a bleeding\ncut above his eye.  The injury required five sutures to\nclose. \nMoreover, Tucker lacks a formal program to evaluate\nresidents who have fallen.  While Tucker’s “falling star” program\n(which identifies residents with an increased fall risk) is\ncommendable, generally accepted professional standards and\nfederal regulations require Tucker to implement a comprehensive\nassessment process each time a resident falls.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(h); 483.20(a-k).  Tucker’s staff fails to do so. \nFurther, the nursing home lacks a multidisciplinary falls\nreduction team.  Falls reduction teams investigate falls and make\nrecommendations to reduce recurrence.  Both processes are\nnecessary in order to identify risk factors and implement\nindividualized preventative measures. \n2.\t Inappropriate Restraint Use and Inadequate\nRestraint Monitoring \nUnder federal regulations and generally accepted\nprofessional standards, Tucker residents must not be subjected to\nany physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of\ndiscipline or convenience unless the restraints are required to\ntreat the resident’s medical symptoms.  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(a);\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 316.  Because Tucker fails to provide\nindividualized behavioral support programs, Tucker instead uses\nrestraints inappropriately to control residents’ behavior.  Thus,\nrestraints are used for the convenience of staff and not for \nemergency intervention to protect individuals from risk of harm,\nin violation of residents’ federal rights. \nThe use of mechanical restraints is excessive at Tucker. \nStrikingly, mechanical restraint use increased exponentially\nduring the latter half of 2006.15  Our record review further \nrevealed that Tucker staff members either neglected to report all\nrestraint use to us, or simply do not understand what constitutes \n15  The use of mechanical restraints at Tucker increased \nsteadily from less than 10 in March 2006 to almost 160 by\nDecember of that year.  These figures do not include the use of\nphysical and chemical restraints, the frequency of which we could\nnot determine from the documentation provided by the facility. \n\n- 20 -\n\na restraint.  Therefore, many restraints commonly used at Tucker\ngo unreported because they are mistakenly not considered\nrestraints by facility staff.  These practices constitute\nsignificant departures from generally accepted professional\nstandards. \nTucker apparently considers only mechanical protective\ndevices like bed rails, trunk restraints, and restrictive chairs\nto be restraints.  In providing pre-tour documents to us, the\nfacility omitted restraint data to account for its use of all\nphysical, mechanical, and chemical restraints for behavioral\npurposes.  Tucker, in fact, uses sedatives and hypnotics,\nphysical holds, and posey jackets to restrain residents, but does\nnot include these uses in its restraint data.  Indeed, when\nquestioned, the facility inaccurately reported to us that it does\nnot use chemical restraints at all.  In the course of our review,\nhowever, we learned from a number of incident and security\nreports that physical and chemical restraints are being used on\nTucker residents. \nFor example, the October 2006 security log indicates that\nresident B.D. was physically restrained on seven separate\noccasions while injections of sedatives or hypnotics were given;\nsecurity also documented that it stood by while these injections\nwere given seven additional times that month.  Tucker officials \nfailed to recognize these as episodes of physical and chemical\nrestraint, however, and therefore failed to otherwise account for\nthem.  We found a number of other episodes of chemical restraint\nin our review.  For instance, after attempting to elope on\nNovember 11, 2006, resident A.E. was given a 2 mg injection of\nAtivan, an antianxiety medication in this case used to treat\nacute agitation.  This chemical restraint was not identified on \nthe psychoactive medication reports we were provided, but a\nnumber of other such chemical restraints were.  These included,\nin the months of October, November, and December alone, one or\nmore chemical restraints ordered for residents A.E., B.E., A.B.,\nA.Q., A.F., and B.F. \n3.\t Inadequate Abuse/Neglect Prevention and\nInvestigation \nTucker fails to provide its residents with adequate\nprotection against abuse and neglect as required by federal\nregulations and generally accepted professional standards.16  See \n16  As with restraint use, we were unable to definitively\ndetermine the number of incidents of abuse and neglect during the \n\n- 21 -\n\n42 C.F.R. § 483.13(b)(c); see also, Liberty Commons Nursing &\nRehab Ctr. - Johnston v. Leavitt, 241 Fed. Appx. 76, 78 (4th Cir.\n2007).  First, autonomy is imperative to conducting\ninvestigations and monitoring restraint practices.  However, at\nTucker, the administrators who conduct these investigations are\nalso responsible for managing residential and clinical services.\nAs investigations and restraint monitoring implicate resident\nrights and protection from harm issues, they should be conducted\nby staff who have no vested interest in the outcome of the\nevaluations.  Second, allegations of abuse or neglect are neither\nconsistently reported nor thoroughly investigated at Tucker.  See \n42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c)(2).  This lack of reporting and\ninvestigation is not only in contravention of generally accepted\nprofessional standards and federal regulations, but it is also\ninconsistent with Tucker’s own policies.  The following examples\nare illustrative: \n•\t On April 19, 2006, resident B.G. reported that a staff\nmember hit her while trying to help her out of bed.  The \nfacility classified this incident type as “behavioral,” and\nno subsequent investigation was ever conducted. \n•\t In June 2006, resident B.H. reported that a staff member had\n“cursed him out” after he requested that his sheets be\nchanged.  The incident was never investigated, apparently\nbecause B.H. had “a history of accusing staff of abuse on\nnumerous occasions.” \n•\t On October 14, 2006, a staff member alleged that another\nstaff member had stolen a resident’s cigarettes.\nApparently, no investigation was initiated. \n•\t On November 25, 2006, resident B.H. was reportedly sexually\ninappropriate with an unidentified female resident.  There \nis no evidence that this allegation was further\ninvestigated. \nWhere Tucker does investigate incidents, the investigations\nare often flawed.  Tucker’s investigations are inadequate both in\ntheir execution and follow-through.  These deficiencies are due \nin large part to the lack of investigator training for Tucker\nadministrators responsible for conducting the investigations. \nsix-month period covered by our document requests.  Documents \nprovided before and during the tour reflected differing numbers\nof such incidents, and Tucker administrators were unable to\nexplain the discrepancy or tell us which figure was accurate. \n\n- 22 -\n\nAdministrators receive no specialized training in conducting an\ninvestigation; their training is limited to abuse prevention\ntraining, a curriculum provided to all employees. \nFurther, although the State conducts a parallel criminal\ninvestigatory process through the South Carolina Law Enforcement\nDivision (“SLED”), Tucker defers its internal investigation and\nany ensuing necessary corrective action until after SLED has\ncompleted its investigation and determined whether to proceed\nwith criminal charges.  Even after Tucker finalizes its own \ninvestigation, the facility does not take corrective action to\naddress all individual and systemic issues identified by the SLED\ninvestigation.  These practices substantially depart from\ngenerally accepted professional standards. \nIn some instances, these deficient practices expose\nresidents to the risk of significant harm.  For example, in\nFebruary 2006, resident B.I. struck a staff member several times\nwhile being assisted with his shower.  One staff member reported\nthat two other staff retaliated against B.I., punching him\nrepeatedly about the back, chest, shoulder, and face.  During\nsubsequent exams, staff found a bleeding scratch on B.I.’s face\nand bruises on his upper chest and stomach.  The SLED \ninvestigation revealed that the two alleged perpetrators\nwitnessed (by signature) each other’s preliminary statements,\nobtained immediately after the incident, and also witnessed five\nother staff members’ statements, including one person identified\nas a potential witness.  Tucker failed to conduct its \ninvestigation in a manner consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  After Tucker received the SLED \ninvestigation results and was notified that criminal charges had\nnot been initiated, the facility simply concluded that the\nallegation was unsubstantiated and returned the staff to regular\nduty.  The facility failed to separately interview alleged\nperpetrators, witnesses, and reporting staff in order to prevent\ncollusion, as is generally accepted practice.  The facility also\nfailed to identify and address critical information uncovered in\nthe SLED investigation, such as the particular nature of B.I.’s\ninjuries and the fact that one alleged perpetrator admittedly\nalways wore large rings on both hands which would have explained\nthe nature of B.I.’s injuries. \nMoreover, corrective actions taken by the facility were\ncounterintuitive.  Although Tucker’s investigation exonerated\nboth staff members, the staff members were required to attend\nadditional abuse training, formally cautioned that the\nappropriateness of their actions remained questionable, and one\nof the alleged perpetrators was reassigned to another building. \n\n- 23 -\n\nIt is not clear how these actions were consistent with Tucker’s \ndetermination that the allegations were unsubstantiated.\nFurther, one of the alleged perpetrators was instructed to\nconduct a class for other staff on techniques for assisting\ncombative residents.  It is a substantial departure from\ngenerally accepted professional standards for a staff member\nwhose actions in this regard are questionable to be training\nothers. \n4.  Lack of Adequate Quality Assurance \nTucker does not systemically ensure provision of quality\nservices as required under federal regulations, and in violation\nof generally accepted professional standards.  See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.75(o); see generally 42 C.F.R. § 483.25.  That said, Tucker\ndoes have a quality assurance (“QA”) department that, with the\nproper modifications, appears to have the capacity to adequately\nmonitor quality of care issues. \nWe found that Tucker quality assurance staff members do not\nfully understand or utilize the quality assurance tools available\nto them.  For example, when questioned, facility officials were\nconfused about the policies and procedures in a number of\nimportant areas, including those governing data collection and\nretrieval, elopement, and restraints.  Moreover, quality\nassurance staff members were unaware of the existence of certain \ntypes of documentation that would aid the self-evaluation\nprocess.  For example, Tucker quality assurance staff was unaware\nof the existence of an elopement form used by the unit staff to\nreport missing residents. \nIn addition, QA practices at Tucker are compromised because\nthe QA director is also an administrator in charge of residential\noperations.  This duality of roles contaminates the objectivity\nof the QA process.  Tucker’s QA department should be managed by\nsomeone who is separated from clinical and residential service\ndelivery, but has equal status in the administration hierarchy. \nOur review also revealed significant concerns in the area of\ndata management.  As previously discussed, Tucker provided us\nwith inconsistent information on the number of investigations\ninto allegations of abuse and neglect during a given six-month\ntime frame.  Facility officials could not account for or resolve\nthe discrepancy.  This lack of reliable data was not limited to \ninvestigations, however.  In the course of our review, we\ndiscovered discrepant data regarding medications, allegations of\nabuse or neglect, and restraint and fall reporting.  This lack of \n\n- 24 -\nreliable data make trend tracking and analysis, necessary to\nquality improvement, virtually impossible. \nF.\t INADEQUATE ACTIVITIES \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards recognize the critical importance that activities and\nmental stimulation play in maintaining good psychological health\namong nursing home residents.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.15(f); Talbot, supra.  Nursing homes like Tucker “must\nprovide for an ongoing program of activities designed to meet ...\nthe interests and the physical, mental, and psychosocial well-\nbeing of each resident.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.15(f)(1). \nWe found that Tucker offers substandard activity programs to\nits residents.  Activity programs at Tucker are not varied and\nhave not been adjusted to meet the diverse needs of the resident\npopulation.  We found that activities provided for residents with\npsychiatric diagnoses, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, were\ninadequate.  We encountered several instances where Alzheimer’s \nresidents were sleeping, watching TV, or otherwise not being\nproperly engaged. \nWhile Tucker has psychologists and activity managers on\nstaff, currently the target for resident participation is one to\ntwo activities per week.  This target appears overly general,\nwoefully infrequent, and not based on each resident’s\ncomprehensive assessment.  One or two activities per week is\ninsufficient to ensure residents’ psychological good health.\nMoreover, Tucker’s activity planning process failed to show that\nactivities were tailored to meet the needs of specific\npopulations.  For example, no tailored activities appear to have\nbeen provided for such groups, generally, as residents with\nHuntington’s Chorea. \nG.\t FAILURE TO SERVE RESIDENTS IN THE MOST INTEGRATED \nSETTING APPROPRIATE TO RESIDENTS’ NEEDS \nSouth Carolina fails to serve Tucker residents in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs in violation of\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  See 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(d) (public entities must provide services in the\nmost integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified\nindividuals).  The preamble to the ADA regulations defines “the\nmost integrated setting” to mean a setting “that enables\nindividuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled \npersons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App.\nA at 450. \n\n- 25 -\n\nIn construing the anti-discrimination provision contained\nwithin the public services portion (Title II) of the ADA, the\nSupreme Court held that “[u]njustified [institutional] isolation\n... is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.”\nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999).  Specifically, the\nCourt established that States are required to provide community-\nbased treatment for persons with disabilities when the State’s\ntreatment professionals have determined that community placement\nis appropriate, provided that the transfer is not opposed by the\naffected individual, and the placement can be reasonably\naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the\nState and the needs of others with disabilities.  Id. at 602,\n607. \nFurther, with the New Freedom Initiative, President George\nW. Bush announced that it was a high priority for his\nAdministration to tear down barriers to equality and to expand\nopportunities available to Americans living with disabilities.\nAs one step in implementing the New Freedom Initiative, on June\n18, 2001, the President signed Executive Order No. 13217,\nentitled “Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with\nDisabilities.”  Specifically, the President emphasized that\nunjustified isolation or segregation of qualified individuals\nwith disabilities in institutions is a form of prohibited\ndiscrimination, that the United States is committed to community-\nbased alternatives for individuals with disabilities, and that\nthe United States seeks to ensure that America’s community-based\nprograms effectively foster independence and participation in the\ncommunity for Americans with disabilities.  Exec. Order No. \n13217, §§ 1(a)-(c), 66 Fed. Reg. 33155 (June 18, 2001).  The \nPresident directed the Attorney General to “fully enforce”\nTitle II of the ADA, especially for the victims of unjustified\ninstitutionalization.  Id. at § 2(c). \nThe State appears to be failing to comply with the ADA in\nthat it is neglecting to place certain persons now living at\nTucker in the most integrated setting appropriate to their\nindividualized needs.  We would expect a facility of this size to\nhave a greater number of residents ready for community placement.\nOur expert was surprised to learn that there was no process in\nplace to refer such residents to the Palmetto Senior Care\nprogram, a Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”)\nwhich accepts persons who would otherwise have no options for\ncommunity placement other than a nursing home.  Tucker personnel\nmay be unaware of the availability of the program and\nconsequently are not thinking in terms of less-restrictive \n\n- 26 -\n\nplacements, which in turn suggests to us that there may be many\nmore residents at Tucker who would qualify for less-restrictive\nplacement. \nEven our brief review revealed these two illustrative \nexamples wherein Tucker residents did not require the level of\nnursing care provided at Tucker, and could be appropriately\nplaced in a less restrictive setting: \n•\t Resident B.J., 66, admitted to Tucker in February 2006 with\na diagnosis of schizophrenia and depression but intact\ncognition, threatened suicide because of a desire to go\nhome.  His tranquilizer dose was increased, but there was no\ninvestigation of possible community placement. \n•\t Resident B.K., 78, was admitted from her own home in April\n2006, with mild dementia and depression.  According to\nTucker records, she developed “visual hallucinations” which\nwere treated with psychoactive drugs.  The psychiatrist\ndetermined later, however, that the visual disturbances B.K.\nwas experiencing were side effects resulting from recent eye\nsurgery, and the psychoactive medication was discontinued.\nAccording to our expert, this resident was very high-\nfunctioning and needed no assistance with any of her\nactivities of daily living.  However, her niece did not want\nher removed from Tucker until she had had a second cataract \noperation.  This resident should clearly have been evaluated\nfor placement, and placed, at a lower level of care. \nH.  INADEQUATE SANITATION \nTucker is required by federal regulations and generally\naccepted professional standards to provide residents with\nadequately prepared meals and a clean environment.  42 C.F.R. \n§§ 35, 65, 70.  We found deficiencies in food service, infection\ncontrol, and housekeeping.\n With respect to food service, we found that Tucker fails to\nserve food at proper temperatures on a consistent basis.  Food \nmaintained at inadequate hot or cold temperatures poses a\nsignificant health risk of food-borne illnesses to Tucker\nresidents.  In addition, we observed many of the food trays to be\ngrossly unsanitary.  Many are covered with a layer of dark soot\nor film, and are worn beyond their ability to be adequately\ncleaned and sanitized.  This issue was previously brought to the\nfacility’s attention in the September 21, 2006 survey conducted\nby CMS. \n\n- 27 -\n\nWe also found that Tucker provides inadequate infection\ncontrol.  Specifically, we are most concerned about the risk of\nbacterial infection Tucker residents may face due to inadequate\nand unsanitary laundry practices.  The laundry machines used at\nTucker are domestic-type washers and dryers, which cannot achieve\nadequate temperature, wash, and rinse cycles required for\nadequate nursing home sanitation.  Moreover, we observed the\nwashers and dryers being overloaded with laundry.  This further \nexacerbates the risk of resident pathogen infection due to\ninadequate sanitation.  Given that methicillin-resistant \nstaphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) has been identified at Tucker, the\nrisk to residents for infection is unacceptably high.17  This risk \nmay be heightened by the fact that Tucker’s policies do not\nadequately address pathogen infection control. \nFinally, we found that Tucker’s housekeeping practices are\ninadequate.  We found that some of the utility closets were used\nto store flammable materials, creating a fire hazard and\naccompanying risk of harm to residents.  Overall facility\ncleanliness was lacking.  The problems were particularly acute at\nFewell and Stone.  We were especially concerned after observing\nthat medical equipment used by Tucker residents (e.g.\nwheelchairs, IV poles, recliners, and blue floor mats) were\ngenerally unclean.  Staff reported that the cleaning supplies\nused at Tucker are diluted as a cost-savings measure.  Improper\ndilution of cleaning supplies poses a substantial risk of harm to\nTucker residents, as it may lead to an increased risk of disease\noutbreaks due to incomplete eradication of pathogens. \nIII.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies and protect the\nconstitutional and statutory rights of Tucker residents, the\nState should implement promptly, at a minimum, the following\nmeasures set forth below: \nA.  NURSING, MEDICAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE \n1.  Mental Health Care Assessments and Diagnoses \nTucker should ensure that its patients receive accurate,\ncomplete, and timely mental health assessments and diagnoses,\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards, and \n17  MRSA is potentially dangerous drug-resistant bacteria\nthat can cause serious systemic illness, permanent disfigurement,\nand death. \n\n- 28 -\nthat these assessments and diagnoses drive treatment\ninterventions.  More particularly, Tucker should: \na.\t Develop and implement comprehensive policies\nand procedures regarding the adequate\ndiagnosis of mental illness and the timeliness\nand content of initial psychiatric assessments\nand ongoing reassessments. \nb.\t Ensure that initial mental health assessments \ninclude a plan of care that outlines specific\nstrategies, with rationales, including\nadjustments of medication regimens and\ninitiation of specific treatment\ninterventions. \n2.  Dysphagia \nTucker should ensure that residents suffering from dysphagia\nare adequately treated.  At minimum, Tucker should: \na.\t Observe and document residents’ symptoms of\ndysphagia, and alert attending physicians in a\ntimely manner so that treatment options can be\nconsidered. \nb.\t Perform physician-ordered swallow evaluations\nin a timely manner. \nc.\t Follow up on health care interventions to\ndetermine whether the treatments are properly\nimplemented and effective. \n3.  Psychoactive Medication \nTucker staff should ensure that residents remain free from \nunnecessary psychoactive drugs unless necessary to treat a\ndiagnosed and documented condition.  Tucker must also ensure that \nresidents using psychoactive drugs receive gradual dose\nreductions, where appropriate.  More particularly, Tucker should: \na.\t Ensure that all psychoactive medications are: \ni.\t prescribed in therapeutic amounts; \nii.\t tailored to each patient’s individual\nsymptoms; and \niii.  properly documented. \n\n- 29 -\n\nb.\t Ensure that the psychiatric progress note\ndocumentation includes: \ni.\t the rationale for the choice and \ncontinued use of drug treatments; \nii.\t careful review and critical assessment \nof the side effects of all medications \nand the use of this information in \ntimely and appropriate adjustment of\nregular drug treatment. \n4.\t Psychiatric Services \nTucker must ensure that residents receive adequate, timely\npsychiatric evaluations and consultations.  At minimum, Tucker\nshould: \na.\t Ensure that psychiatric assessments and\nreassessments are completed within time-frames\nthat reflect the resident’s needs. \nb.\t Implement recommendations resulting from\npsychiatric consultations in a timely manner. \nc.\t Adequately document psychiatrist notes in\nresidents’ charts in a timely manner. \nd.\t Provide sufficient psychiatrist staffing to\nensure residents receive adequate psychiatrist\nservices. \n5.\t Pressure Sores \nTucker must ensure that residents do not develop pressure\nsores, where avoidable.  In particular, Tucker should: \na.\t Adequately document the development of\npressure sores. \nb.\t Document, where applicable, interventions\nattempted and reasons why the development of\npressure sores were unavoidable. \nc.\t At the earliest sign of pressure sore\ndevelopment, document and implement\nindividualized treatment plans to combat the\ndevelopment or further deterioration of\npressure sores. \n\n- 30 -\n\n6.\t Palliative and End-of-Life Care \nTucker must ensure that its residents receive comprehensive\ncare for pain and end-of-life symptoms.  At minimum, Tucker\nshould: \na.\t Implement policies and procedures to ensure\nthat residents receive adequate assessment and\ntreatment for pain, particularly at the end-\nof-life. \nb.\t Adequately ensure that staff are trained in\npalliative and end-of-life care, consistent\nwith generally accepted professional\nstandards. \n7.\t Death Reviews \nTucker must conduct quality management reviews of care\nwhenever a resident dies to determine the adequacy of care\nprovided and develop care improvement strategies.  At minimum,\nTucker should: \na.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive death\nreview system consistent with generally\naccepted professional standards of care. \ni.\t Collect information related to the \nadequacy of the treatments, services,\nand supports provided by Tucker,\nincluding hospital information, if\navailable and appropriate; \nii.\t Analyze the information collected in\norder to identify strengths and\nweaknesses within the current system;\nand \niii.  Identify and monitor implementation of\ncorrective and preventative actions to\naddress identified issues and ensure \nresolution of underlying problems. \nB.\t NUTRITION AND HYDRATION \nTucker must provide adequate nutritional management\nservices, including: \n1.\t Conduct adequate nutritional assessments of\nindividual residents’ specific nutritional needs; \n\n- 31 -\n2.\t Ensure that residents receive appropriate diets,\nas medically necessary; \n3.\t Monitor residents’ nutritional status, weight, and\nfood intake, as medically necessary; \n4.\t Ensure that residents who need assistance in \neating are assisted by adequately trained staff; \n5.\t Ensure that residents are not exposed to undue\nrisk of aspiration pneumonia; and, \n6.\t Provide residents with adequate amounts of fluids\nto ensure proper hydration. \nC.\t BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMMING \nTucker must develop an adequate behavioral intervention and\nassessment program.  At minimum, Tucker should: \n1.\t Provide adequate and appropriate behavioral\nservices in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards. \nD.\t DOCUMENTATION \nTucker should adequately document treatment provided for its\nresidents.  At minimum, the Tucker should: \n1.\t Adequately document nutritional supplementation; \n2.\t Adequately record residents’ bathing; and \n3.\t Adequately train staff regarding the importance of\nrecord keeping. \nE.\t PROTECTION FROM HARM \nTucker should provide its residents with a safe and humane\nenvironment and protect them from harm.  At a minimum, Tucker\nshould: \n1.\t Fall Prevention \na.\t Create or revise, as appropriate, and\nimplement an incident management system that\ncomports with generally accepted professional\nstandards; \n\n- 32 -\n\ni.\t Create or revise, as appropriate, and\nimplement comprehensive, consistent\nincident management policies and\nprocedures that provide clear guidance\nregarding documenting requirements and\nthe categorization of incidents,\nincluding falls, restraints, and\nallegations of abuse and neglect; \n2.  Restraint Use and Monitoring \na. \t Develop a policy and procedure that adequately\ndefines what constitutes a restraint; \nb.\t Require all staff to complete successfully\ncompetency-based training in the revised\nreporting requirements; \nc. \t Ensure that restraints are not used for the \nconvenience of staff; \n3.  Abuse/Neglect Prevention and Investigation \na.\t Create or revise, as appropriate, and\nimplement policies and procedures addressing\nthe investigation of serious incidents, such\nas abuse and neglect.  Such policies and\nprocedures shall include requirements that\nsuch incidents are to be thoroughly\ninvestigated by unbiased staff members, and\nthat the investigations will include\nconsideration of staff’s adherence to \nprogrammatic requirements; \nb.\t Monitor the performance of staff charged with\ninvestigative responsibilities and provide\ntechnical assistance and training whenever\nnecessary to ensure the thorough, competent,\nand timely completion of investigations of\nserious incidents; \nc.\t Develop and implement a reliable system to\nidentify the need for, and monitor the\nimplementation of, appropriate corrective and\npreventative actions addressing problems\nidentified as a result of investigations; and \nd.\t Review, revise, as appropriate, and implement\npolicies and procedures related to the \n\n- 33 -\ntracking and trending of incident data,\nincluding data from the abuse and neglect\nallegations, to ensure that appropriate\ncorrective actions are identified and \nimplemented in response to problematic trends. \n4.\t Quality Assurance \na.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive quality\nimprovement system consistent with generally\naccepted professional standards of care.  At a \nminimum, such a system should: \ni.\t Collect information related to the \nadequacy of the provision of the\nprotections, treatments, services, and\nsupports provided by Tucker, as well as\nthe outcomes being achieved by patients; \nii.\t Analyze the information collected in\norder to identify strengths and\nweaknesses within the current system;\nand \niii.  Identify and monitor implementation of\ncorrective and preventative actions to\naddress identified issues and ensure \nresolution of underlying problems. \nF.\t ACTIVITIES \nTucker should provide adequate activities for its residents.\nAt minimum, the facility should: \n1.\t Provide sufficient and meaningful activities for\nall residents, and make efforts to get residents\ninvolved in activities. \n2.\t Ensure that nursing staff monitor, document, and\nreport accurately and routinely, patients’\nparticipation in behavioral programming activities\nand on patients’ responses, or lack thereof, to\nbehavioral interventions. \n\n- 34 -\nG.\t SERVING RESIDENTS IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING \nAPPROPRIATE TO RESIDENTS’ NEEDS \nTucker should provide residents with the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to their needs, in compliance with the ADA.\nAt minimum, Tucker should: \n1.\t Ensure staff adequately review the level of\nnursing care each resident requires, so as to\nensure that the proper level is applied. \nH.\t SANITATION \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies in food service and\nsanitation, the Tucker should implement promptly, at a minimum,\nthe following measures set forth below: \n1.  Provide each resident with safe food services; \n2.  Provide adequate infection control; and \n3.  Provide adequate housekeeping services. \n* * * \nPlease note that this findings letter is a public document.\nIt will be posted on the Civil Rights Division’s website.
