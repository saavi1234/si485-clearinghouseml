On February 10, 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit against Morgan County, TN, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, which was assigned to Judge James H. Jarvis. The DOJ alleged that Morgan County “failed to provide [detainees] adequate security, medical and mental health care, fire safety, sanitation, or access to courts.” This lawsuit followed a 1997 investigation of Morgan County Jail that “found that the jail was unsanitary, dangerously understaffed, and lacked basic medical and mental health care systems,” and that there had been “escapes, suicide attempts, and sexual assault and harassment of female inmates by jail staff and inmates.” (<a href=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/February/064cr.htm>Department of Justice Press Release, 2/10/2000</a>).</p><p>The case was filed under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997 et seq. It is unknown what sort of relief was sought, but it was likely injunctive or injunctive-like relief as authorized by § 1997a ordering Morgan County to improve the jail. Morgan County demanded a jury, but Judge Jarvis granted the DOJ’s motion to strike their jury demand. A trial date was set for April 9, 2001, but prior to trial, the DOJ and Morgan County filed a joint motion for conditional dismissal, and filed a settlement agreement on June 27, 2000.</p><p>The settlement “provided for renovation or construction of the Jail to eliminate suicide hazards, provide sufficient living space for inmates, and improve fire safety, general safety and sanitation; hiring and training of additional staff; maintenance of contracts to provide adequate medical, dental and mental health services; improvements in inmate access to legal materials, privacy and protections from harassment for female inmates, as well as new policies and procedures to prevent sexual misconduct by staff.”(CRIPA Activities in FY 2000). </p><p>On June 28, 2000, Judge Jarvis granted the motion for a dismissal conditioned on Morgan County’s compliance with the settlement. The case was moved to the inactive docket, although the Court retained jurisdiction. </p><p>On July 17, 2006, the DOJ moved to dismiss the case, stating in their motion that based on compliance reports, documents, and expert consultants, including on-site observations and interviews of incarcerated individuals, Morgan County was substantially complying with the terms of the settlement.</p><p>Judge Jarvis dismissed the case with prejudice on July 20, 2006. The CRIPA spreadsheet, which the Clearinghouse obtained through a FOIA request, says that the matter closed on July 28, 2006. </p>",

Before the lawsuit went to trial, the parties were able to reach a settlement agreement, and the case was conditionally dismissed in 2000.

Introduction and Overview\nThe Attorney General has authority to investigate conditions in public residential facilities (1) and to take appropriate\n action if a pattern or practice of unlawful conditions deprive persons confined in the facilities of their constitutional or\n federal statutory rights pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997- 1997j\n (2). Protecting the rights of institutionalized persons is an important part of the Department's civil rights law\n enforcement effort. From May 1980, when CRIPA was enacted, through September 2000, the Department investigated\n conditions in 344 jails, prisons, juvenile correctional facilities, mental retardation and mental health facilities, and\n nursing homes. As a result of the Department's CRIPA enforcement, tens of thousands of institutionalized persons who\n were living in dire, often life-threatening, conditions now receive adequate care and services.\nThe Attorney General has delegated day-to-day responsibility for CRIPA activities to the Special Litigation Section of\n the Civil Rights Division. During fiscal year 2000, the Section was active in CRIPA matters and cases involving more\n than 187 facilities in 33 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the\n Northern Mariana Islands, and the Territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands. (3) The Section initiated investigations of\n nine facilities, continued its investigations of 57 additional facilities, and monitored the implementation of consent\n decrees, settlement agreements, and other court orders involving 123 facilities. The Attorney General filed three CRIPA\n suits involving seven facilities during the fiscal year. All of these suits were settled during the fiscal year. One case was\n litigated in a month long trial in the Middle District of Florida during the fiscal year. In addition, the Section resolved\n one institutional matter with an out of court settlement. During fiscal year 2000, the Section closed investigations of\n two facilities and joined with defendants to dismiss five cases involving thirteen facilities.\nIn keeping with the statutory requirements of CRIPA and the Attorney General's initiative, the Section engaged in\n negotiations and conciliation efforts to resolve a number of CRIPA matters both before and after filing CRIPA cases.\n The Section maximized its impact and increased its efficiency by continuing to focus on multi-facility investigations\n and cases, obtaining widespread relief whenever possible.\nII. Filing of CRIPA Complaints/Resolution of Lawsuits\nA. Cases Filed\n1. On December 7, 1999, the Department filed a complaint in United States v. Maricopa County (D. Ariz.) regarding the\n provision of medical and mental health services to 7,000 inmates of the Maricopa County Jail which is comprised of\n five facilities. Simultaneously, the parties filed a settlement agreement that provided for hiring of additional medical\n and mental health staff; improved medical evaluation services both for intake and routine care; additional space for the\n provision of medical services; an improved distribution system for medications and monitoring of possible side effects;\n creation of an Infection Control Committee; and improved quality assurance mechanisms to assess the quality of\n medical and mental health services provided at the facilities.\n2. On February 10, 2000, the Department filed a complaint in United States v. Morgan County, Tennessee (E.D. Tenn.)\n concerning conditions of confinement at the Morgan County Jail. This action followed unsuccessful attempts to resolve\n the investigation of this facility. On June 27, 2000, the parties filed a settlement agreement. It provided for renovation\n or construction of the Jail to eliminate suicide hazards, provide sufficient living space for inmates, and improve fire\n safety, general safety and sanitation; hiring and training of additional staff; maintenance of contracts to provide\n adequate medical, dental and mental health services; improvements in inmate access to legal materials, privacy and\n protections from harassment for female inmates, as well as new policies and procedures to prevent sexual misconduct\n by staff.\n3. In December 1999, the United States was requested by the court expert in Williams v. Stalder (E.D. La.), which\n involved Louisiana prisons, to evaluate the adequacy of services at the recently-opened Jena Juvenile Justice Center, a\n juvenile facility run by Wackenhut Corporation on behalf of Louisiana, and report to the court. The United States\n uncovered life-threatening conditions at the facility for about 240 youth and reported those conditions to the court in",
