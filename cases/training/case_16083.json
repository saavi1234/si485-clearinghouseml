TSHVs served as care facilities for veterans in need of intermediate or long-term rehabilitation, medical, or nursing care. During the underlying investigation, which began in February 2007 and occurred with the full cooperation of the State, the DOJ conducted tours of TSHVs and consulted with experts in the fields of geriatric care and nursing home administration. Plaintiff found that a number of conditions in the facilities violated residents' federal rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff made a number of factual allegations about the inadequacy of the care provided at TSHVs, including that the State engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to provide adequate nutrition, psychiatric care, end-of-life care and pain management, and that the State did not maintain a safe environment in the TSHVs. Plaintiff brought claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Social Security Act. Acting under the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act (42 U.S. § 1997), plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>After the DOJ made a report of its findings to the State, the parties agreed to settle pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement. Accordingly, after negotiations, the parties jointly filed a Stipulated Settlement Agreement on the same day plaintiff filed its Complaint. The parties indicated that since the DOJ made a report of its findings to the State, the State had already made significant efforts to improve the areas of concern. </p><p>The terms of the Settlement Agreement provided that defendants would conduct assessments and create and implement protocols to ensure the following: 1) proper nutrition and hydration of TSVH residents; 2) safe feeding plans for those at risk of aspiration; 3) the provision of adequate and appropriate psychiatric and psychotropic care; 4) the provision of adequate end-of-life care and pain management; and 5) adequate fall prevention measures. The Settlement Agreement was to remain in effect for eighteen months, or until the State had achieved and maintained compliance for at least six months. </p><p>Simultaneously, the parties moved for conditional dismissal. Judge Daniel Breen granted their motion to dismiss, with the Court reserving jurisdiction only for enforcement of the Agreement. </p><p>The case closed in 2010 upon termination of the 18-month-long Agreement. </p>",

The DOJ found that the State had failed to provide adequate nutrition, psychiatric care, and safe conditions for residents at the TSHVs, and brought claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Social Security Act. \r\n\r\nThe court immediately approved of the Settlement Agreement, which required the State to improve all conditions giving rise to the allegations and maintain adequate safety, healthcare, and nutrition for residents. Also on January 9, the court granted the parties' conditional motion to dismiss the case. The Agreement was in effect for 18 months, and the case is now closed. \r\n\r\nThe case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.  ",

      "text": "MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE\n \nOF TENNESSEE REGARDING THE TENNESSEE STATE VETERANS’ HOMES\n \nI.  INTRODUCTION\n \n1.   This Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) is entered into by\n \nthe United States and the State of Tennessee (“State”).  This MOA\n \naddresses certain aspects of the United States’ investigation\n \ninto the conditions of care and treatment of the residents in the\n \nTennessee State Veterans’ Homes in Humboldt and Murfreesboro,\n \nTennessee (collectively, “TSVHs”), pursuant to the Civil Rights\n \nof Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. \n\n2.  The United States’ investigation began on February 12,\n \n2007, when the United States notified the State, pursuant to\n \nCRIPA, that it was initiating an investigation into the\n \nconditions of care and treatment of TSVHs residents.\n \n3.  As part of the investigation, the United States toured\n \nthe TSVHs in April, May, and July 2007.  On February 5, 2008, the\n \nUnited States notified the State of the findings of its\n \ninvestigation, and thereafter, conducted another tour of the\n \nfacilities in October and November 2008.\n \n4.  This MOA addresses certain concerns raised by the United\n \nStates in its February 5, 2008 findings letter.\n \n   5.  It is the position of the United States that the care,\n \nliving conditions, and the treatment of TSVHs’ residents\n \nimplicate rights of these residents that are secured or protected\n \nby the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the\n \nUnited States.\n \n\n-2­\n6.  The State does not agree that conditions at the TSVHs\n \nimplicate constitutional rights for the residents of the TSVHs. \n\nNothing in this MOA in any way impacts the State from raising\n \nsuch a defense in any legal proceeding.\n \n7.  The parties entering into this MOA recognize, that\n \nsince the initiation of this investigation, the State has made\n \nefforts to improve the care it provides to TSVHs residents.\n \n8.  The parties agree to the provisions set forth in this\n \nMOA to ensure that these ongoing improvements continue to be\n \nimplemented and maintained at the TSVHs.  This MOA provides for\n \nactions, practices, and procedures that the State agrees to\n \nimplement.\n \n9.   Each and every provision of this MOA is entered into by\n \nclear agreement of the parties.\n \n10.  In entering into this MOA, the State does not admit any\n \nviolation of state or federal law, and this MOA may not be used\n \nas evidence of liability in any legal proceeding.\n \n11.  The provisions of this MOA are a lawful, fair,\n \nadequate, and reasonable resolution of part of this\n \ninvestigation.\n \n12.  The purpose of this MOA is to achieve the substantive\n \noutcomes set forth within this MOA.\n \n13.  This MOA is binding on the State and its agencies\n \nand/or departments that may have an effect, either directly or\n \nindirectly, either currently or in the future, on the operations\n \nof the TSVHs.\n \n\n-3­\n14.  This MOA is not intended to impair or expand the right\n \nany person or organization to seek relief against the State, or\n \nits officials, employees, or agents for their conduct or the\n \nconduct of State employees; accordingly, this MOA does not alter\n \nlegal standards governing such claims, including those under\n \nTennessee law.\n \nII.
