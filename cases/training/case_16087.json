    "summary": "<p>On July 20, 1988, women incarcerated at the Nebraska Center for Women (NCW) filed a grievance with the prison's superintendent alleging that they received unequal treatment in the programs and services as compared to men incarcerated at various other prisons around Nebraska. Specifically, the plaintiffs claims revolved around access to courts, visitation opportunities, recreation time, education and vocational training, pay, library facilities, mental health programs, and general health care. When the superintendent failed to adequately address the women's concerns, they filed a pro se class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska. After counsel was appointed to represent the women, they filed an amended complaint and a motion for class certification. The proposed class consisted of \"all female prisoners confined at [NCW] as of January 1, 1988, and all female prisoners who will be confined at NCW until the conclusion of this lawsuit.” </p><p>In April 1989, Judge Warren K. Urbom certified the class. The plaintiffs filed a second and third amended complaint in June 1989 and September 1990, respectively. On January 29, 1991, Judge Urbom granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on some Eighth Amendment claims, and also found that claims against defendants in their official capacities were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Four claims remained after Judge Urbom's order: <ol></p><p>  <li>An Equal Protection claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the defendants did not maintain \"parity\" in the programs and services at female prisons as compared to male prisons.</li></p><p>  <li>A claim alleging that the defendants violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 by failing to provide equal programs and services as compared to male prisons.</li></p><p>  <li>A Fourteenth Amendment due process claim 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the defendants infringed upon the plaintiffs' right of access to courts by providing inadequate legal assistance.</li></p><p>  <li>An Eighth Amendment claim 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical and dental needs.</li></p><p></ol>The remaining claims proceeded to trial. The defendants' liability was bifurcated from their damages; the liability aspects proceeded to a 19-day trial held in July and August of 1992. On June 21, 1993, Judge Richard Kopf issued an opinion. 824 F. Supp. 1374. He ruled that the plaintiffs succeeded in proving an Equal Protection violation with regards to the defendants administration of employment opportunities, education and vocational programs, law library access, medical and dental care, mental health care, and recreation options. The only Equal Protection claim that failed was alleged unequal visitation practices. Judge Kopf also ruled that the plaintiffs succeeded on their Title IX claims with regards to educational programs, and their Fourteenth Amendment due process claim with regards to law library access. However, Judge Kopf found in favor of the defendants on the Eighth Amendment medical care claims after determining that the defendants did not have the requisite culpable state of mind.</p><p>The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal arguing that the district court incorrectly applied the law with regards to the Equal Protection claims. On August 10, 1994, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's decision after finding that the female plaintiffs were not similarly situated to the male prisoners for the purposes of prison programs and services. 31 F.3d 72. The Eighth Circuit found that the complaint did not allege disparate funding between female and male prisons, so any discrepancy in programming was due to administrative decisions about how to utilize the allocated funds. The plaintiffs appealed the Eighth Circuit's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Court denied certiorari. 513 U.S. 1185.</p><p>After the Eighth Circuit issued their opinion with regards to the Equal Protection claims, the district court reversed its judgment on the Title IX claims, too. 887 F. Supp. 1281. Because the female and male facilities were not similarly situated for comparison in the Equal Protection context, they also could not form the basis of a Title IX claim, either.</p><p>On October 13, 1995, after holding a second trial to determine damages on the sole remaining claim of inadequate access to the law library, Judge Kopf awarded the plaintiffs $2.00 in nominal damages. 902 F. Sup. 1036. Judge Kopf found that the defendants did not act recklessly or with callous indifference toward the plaintiffs, and therefore declined to award punitive damages. Two months later, Judge Kopf found that the plaintiffs' counsel asked for reasonable attorneys' fees and awarded $40,642.44. 909 F. Supp. 1239.</p><p>The defendants appealed the district court's damages ruling to the Eighth Circuit. On February 25, 1997, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's finding on the access to to courts claim and vacated the award of nominal damages and attorneys' fees. 107 F.3d 609. The Eight Circuit found that the plaintiffs failed to show an actual injury, thereby precluding their ability to succeed on an access-to-courts claim. As the appeals court reversed the district court's finding with respect to this final claim, the last of the plaintiffs' surviving claims was denied. As such, because the plaintiffs last claims were similarly extinguished, the case ended. </p>",

By and large, the answer to that \nquestion is no. \nAlthough women prisoners are generally well treated by a very competent and extremely \ndedicated superintendent and staff at the one Nebraska prison for women, I find and \nconclude that in important respects regarding programs and services, both presently and in \nthe past, Nebraska has violated, and does now violate, the rights of women prisoners \nguaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I now \nset forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which have informed my decision.[2] \n\nI. Introduction \nA. Background \n1. \nIf you are a woman, if you break the law in Nebraska, and if you are required to serve a \nprison sentence, you will be sent to the Nebraska Center for Women (NCW). NCW is \nlocated in York, Nebraska, a small town in east central Nebraska located about 100 miles \nfrom Omaha, Nebraska, and about 50 miles from Lincoln, Nebraska. NCW is the only prison \nfor women in Nebraska. Thus, 1381*1381 no matter what your crime, and regardless of \nwhether you are classified as a minimum, medium or maximum custody inmate, you will do \nyour time at NCW. \nAlthough this case is not about ambience, in many respects NCW looks like a college \ncampus. The chief administrator at NCW is called a \"superintendent.\" There are no gun \ntowers. However, the \"campus\" is surrounded by a tall, barbed-wire fence. During the times \npertinent to this lawsuit, the population at NCW ranged from about 90 inmates to about 130 \ninmates and included inmates with minimum, medium, and maximum custody designations. \nIf you are a man and you break the law in Nebraska you could be sent to any one of a \nnumber of penal institutions to serve your sentence. Where you go generally depends on \nyour custody classification. \nYou could be sent to the Hastings Correctional Center (HCC) in Hastings, Nebraska. You \ncould be sent to the Omaha Correctional Center (OCC) in Omaha, Nebraska. You could be \nsent to the Lincoln Correctional Center (LCC) in Lincoln, Nebraska. \nIf you are a man, you could also be sent to the Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP) which is \nlocated in Lincoln, Nebraska, near LCC. NSP normally houses medium and maximum \ncustody inmates, but does not normally house minimum custody inmates. \nNSP looks like a traditional prison. Thick block walls or very tall fences with barbed wire \nsurround the prison. A number of gun towers overlook NSP. During the times pertinent to \nthis lawsuit, the NSP inmate population ranged from about 650 inmates to something less \nthan 800 inmates. The chief administrator at NSP is called a \"warden.\" \nAll prisons in Nebraska are run by a state agency known as the Department of Correctional \nServices (DCS). DCS is located in Lincoln, Nebraska. The chief administrator of DCS is \ncalled a \"director.\" The director of DCS has the power to set policy. The director assigns \nand reassigns superintendents and wardens. \n2. \nBy January, 1988, some of the women inmates at NCW were upset. They perceived an \ninequality in the treatment they received compared to the treatment male inmates received. \n\nSpecifically, the women were concerned about programs — such as education — and \nservices — such as the law library. The NCW inmates corresponded with an inmate who \nserved as a legal aide at NSP, and that correspondence evidently did not alleviate the \nconcerns of the NCW inmates. Believing they were being treated unfairly, the women \nprepared a written grievance and circulated it among the other inmates at NCW. The \nsuperintendent of NCW became aware of the grievance while it was being circulated. \nIn late January, 1988, the superintendent had a meeting with certain DCS staff members \nand the heads — wardens and superintendents—of all the adult prisons in Nebraska. This \nwas a regularly scheduled meeting. At the meeting, the NCW superintendent told those in \nattendance, among other things, that the inmates at NCW had corresponded with the legal \naide at NSP, that the women were concerned about the perceived inequality of certain \nprograms provided for the women when compared to what the men received, and that the \nsuperintendent expected a grievance to be filed. He also warned of the possibility of federal \nlitigation. \nThe director of DCS was not present at the meeting in late January, 1988. But, as was the \nnormal practice, the director received what were in essence minutes of the meeting. The \nannouncement of the NCW superintendent about the inmate grievance was described in the \nminutes. \nIn early March, 1988, more than half the inmates at NCW signed a grievance and delivered \nit to the superintendent at NCW. The grievance was long and detailed, but essentially \ncomplained that the women were not receiving parity of treatment in programs and services \nas compared to male inmates. \nThe NCW superintendent acknowledged receipt of the grievance, but refused to deal with it \nbecause, according to the superintendent, it required certain comparisons \nwhich 1382*1382 the NCW staff could not make. The superintendent suggested to the NCW \ninmates that they submit the grievance to the director of DCS. \nThe NCW inmates submitted the grievance to the director of DCS in early March, 1988. \nLegal counsel for DCS looked into the grievance and prepared a draft letter in response to \nthe grievance for signature by the director. In the latter part of March, 1988, the director of \nDCS had a meeting with the heads of all the adult prisons and certain DCS staff members. \nThe grievance was discussed. It was agreed that the letter drafted by counsel should be \nsent in response to the grievance. Soon thereafter, in March, 1988, the letter was sent to \nthe inmates at NCW. \nThe response of the director of DCS was long and detailed, like the grievance of the NCW \ninmates. In most important respects, the letter response denied any inequality. In three \nimportant respects — lack of equal pay, lack of visitation for orientation inmates, and lack of \ninmate training regarding legal research — the director promised some relief. Relief was \ngranted in other minor respects, such as equalizing when the lights had to be turned off. \nThe director also informed the inmates that a \"task force\" had been established to assure \nconsistency. \n\nBy mid-July, 1988, the promised equal pay had not come about. By mid-July, 1988, no \nNCW inmate had completed training in legal research. There is a dispute as to whether the \norientation visitation policy had changed by mid-July, 1988. The NCW inmates had heard \nnothing from the \"task force.\" \nB. Procedural History \n1. \nThe initial complaint in this case was filed pro se by certain NCW inmates on July 20, \n1988.[3] (Filing 2.) The case was assigned to the Honorable Warren K. Urbom, who was \nthen a United States District Judge in active service. \nIn October, 1988, counsel was appointed to represent the pro se plaintiffs. (Filing 5.)[4] In \nJanuary, 1989, counsel filed an amended complaint, (Filing 12), and a motion for \nclassaction certification. (Filing 13.) \nJudge Urbom granted the class-action motion, and certified the class this way: \"The class \nshall consist of all female prisoners at [NCW] as of the filing of this action and all women \nwho will be confined at NCW up until the conclusion of this lawsuit.\" (Filing 19, ¶ 2 of the \norder.) The plaintiffs then moved to clarify the class certification because one of the plaintiffs \nhad been released from NCW a few days prior to suit being filed. (Filing 21.) \nThe class was redefined on April 19, 1989, to \"include all female prisoners confined at \n[NCW] in York, Nebraska (NCW) as of January 1, 1988, and all female prisoners who will \nbe confined at NCW until the conclusion of this lawsuit.\" (Filing 26, ¶ 2, at 2.) The phrasing \nof the last order was that of United States Magistrate Judge Piester, based upon his \nunderstanding of what the parties had agreed to. (Id.) For practical purposes, the court \ncertified the class as all women who were NCW inmates at any time on or after January 1, \n1988, through the conclusion of this case.[5] \n1383*1383 A second amended complaint (Filing 31) was filed June 15, 1989, and a third \namended complaint (Filing 333) was filed September 6, 1990. The normal pleading practice \nfollowed. A very extensive pretrial conference order (Filing 409) was entered October 23, \n1990. \nIn the pretrial conference order the parties agreed that the following may be accepted as \nestablished facts for purposes of this case only: \n1. The plaintiff Cheryl Klinger was an inmate assigned to the Nebraska Center for Women \nfrom October 26, 1987, to July 11, 1988. \n2. The plaintiff Linda Lange was an inmate assigned to the Nebraska Center for Women \nfrom October 21, 1987, until October 12, 1989. \n3. The plaintiff Stacy Finn was an inmate assigned to the Nebraska Center for Women from \nDecember 28, 1987, to December 14, 1989. \n\n4. The plaintiff Gweniver Lay was an inmate assigned to the Nebraska Center for Women \nfrom February 9, 1988, through November 28, 1988, and from June 16, 1989, through \nAugust 28, 1989. \n5. The defendant, Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, is and was, at all times \nrelevant to the third amended complaint, the state agency in charge of matters involving the \ncontrol and operation of Nebraska's correctional facilities. \n6. The defendant, Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, operates the Nebraska \nState Penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska, and the Nebraska Center for Women in York, \nNebraska. \n7. The Nebraska State Penitentiary houses only male inmates. \n8. The Nebraska Center for Women houses only female inmates. \n9. The defendant, Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, receives federal funds to \noperate some educational programs in the Nebraska correctional facilities. \n10. The defendant, Frank Gunter, was the director of the Nebraska Department of \nCorrectional Services until February 24, 1990, and was an employee of the State of \nNebraska, in that capacity. \n11. The defendant, Harold Clarke, has been the director of the Nebraska Department of \nCorrectional Services since August 27, 1990, and is an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n12. The defendant, Larry Tewes, was the acting superintendent of the Nebraska Center for \nWomen from August 4, 1988, to January 5, 1989, and was an employee of the State of \nNebraska, in that capacity. \n13. The defendant, Victor Lofgreen, was the superintendent of the Nebraska Center for \nWomen until August 3, 1988, and was an employee of the State of Nebraska, in that \ncapacity. \n14. The defendant, Larry Wayne, has been the superintendent of the Nebraska Center for \nWomen since January 5, 1989, and is an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n15. At all times relevant to the third amended complaint, the superintendent of the Nebraska \nCenter for Women was and is responsible for the custody, control and correctional \ntreatment of persons committed to that correctional facility and for the general \nadministration of that correctional facility in accordance with the laws and the Constitution of \nthe United States. \n16. The defendant, Margrett Wehland, is and was at all times relevant to the third amended \ncomplaint, a medical nurse at the Nebraska Center for Women and an employee of the \nState of Nebraska. \n17. The defendant, Judith Danielson, is and was at all times relevant to the third amended \ncomplaint, a psychologist at the 1384*1384 Nebraska Center for Women and an employee of \nthe State of Nebraska. \n18. The defendants, Frank Gunter and Victor Lofgreen, are sued solely in their individual \ncapacities. \n19. The defendant, Harold Clarke, is sued solely in his official capacity. \n20. The defendants, Larry Wayne, Margrett Wehland, and Judith Danielson, are sued in \nboth their official and individual capacities. (Filing 409, at 2-4.) \nOn November 6, 1990, Judge Urbom denied defendants' motion to decertify the class, \nholding that the class was properly certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2). (Filing \n435.) \n\nOn January 29, 1991, Judge Urbom granted in part and denied in part a motion for \nsummary judgment filed by the defendants. (Filings 486 and 487.) In so doing, Judge \nUrbom noted that this suit essentially involved the claim that \"defendants have illegally \ndiscriminated against [plaintiffs] on the basis of their gender by providing [programs and \nservices] that are inferior to those offered to male inmates at [NSP].\"[6] (Filing 486, at 1.) \nJudge Urbom denied the motion for summary judgment in all but the following respects: (1) \nhe granted summary judgment for all defendants in their official capacities as to claims \nagainst them for damages to the extent barred by the Eleventh Amendment; (2) he granted \nsummary judgment for defendant Lofgreen, who had been an NCW superintendent, as to \nclaims for injunctive relief because Lofgreen was no longer the superintendent at NCW; (3) \nhe granted summary judgment as to all individual defendants for Eighth Amendment claims \nof deliberate indifference to serious mental health needs; (4) he granted summary judgment \nregarding Judith Danielson for any Eighth Amendment claims of deliberate indifference of \nany kind; and (5) he granted summary judgment as to the fifth cause of action dealing with \ninstitutional rules and regulations and the sixth cause of action dealing with conspiracy \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1985. (Filing 486, at 2-11; Filing 487.) \n2. \nDue to the extensive (and sometimes bitter)[7] discovery phase of this case, and the busy \nschedule of Judge Urbom,[8] the case was not finally set for trial until July 27, 1992. As trial \ntime approached, Judge Urbom was required by the Speedy Trial Act to try a number of \ncriminal cases at the same time this case had been set for trial. Thus, upon a request for \nreassignment by Judge Urbom, this case was assigned to me by Chief Judge Strom on \nJune 19, 1992. (Filing 584.) With the parties agreeing that the liability phase of trial would \nbe bifurcated from the remedy and damage phase of trial, trial of this case commenced on \nJuly 27, 1992. \nThe net impact of Judge Urbom's ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary \njudgment in part was that trial was limited to four liability issues. Broadly, and generally \nstated, those issues were: \n(1) Were the female inmates at NCW discriminated against because of their sex in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by a quantitative or qualitative \nlack of \"parity\" in programs and services as compared to the male inmates at NSP; \n(2) Were the female inmates at NCW discriminated against because of their sex in violation \nof Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, by a quantitative \nor qualitative lack of \"parity\" in educational programs receiving federal \nfinancial 1385*1385 assistance as compared to the male inmates at NSP; \n(3) Were the female inmates at NCW denied their right of access to the courts under the \nFourteenth Amendment because of the alleged inadequacy of the law library and the \nalleged lack of trained and independent inmate legal aides at NCW; \n\n(4) Were the female inmates at NCW denied their right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment because of the alleged deliberate indifference to \ntheir serious medical and dental needs. \nThe liability phase ended after 19 trial days. A briefing and oral argument schedule was \nestablished. The matter was finally submitted to me in late October, 1992. \nI turn now to the four liability issues. \nII. Equal Protection \nThe plaintiffs do not claim that the segregation of men and women in Nebraska prisons \nsolely because of their gender is per se violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.[9] In fact, plaintiffs describe a similar decision in Michigan as an \n\"otherwise justifiable legislative decision to house the sexes separately.\" (Pls.' Post-Trial Br. \nat 17.) Rather, the plaintiffs claim that segregated women at NCW are not provided with \nsubstantially equivalent opportunities compared to the male inmates at NSP, and it is this \nfailure to provide \"parity\" of treatment which is said to violate the Equal Protection Clause. \nThe challenged programs deal with employment/economic concerns, educational/vocational \ntraining concerns, concerns about the law library, concerns about medical and dental \nservices, concerns about mental health services, recreation concerns, and concerns about \nvisitation. \nA. The Proper Test \nModern equal protection doctrine is based upon three types of judicial scrutiny: the rational \nbasis test, the heightened scrutiny test, and the strict scrutiny test. Note, Women's \nPrisons, 94 Yale L.J. at 1185-86. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants agree that the strict \nscrutiny test is not applicable here since it is employed in cases involving race, not \nsex. Id. at 1186-87 n. 22. Therefore, I must first determine whether to apply the rational \nbasis test or the heightened scrutiny test.[10] \n1. Rational Basis \nIf the governmental purpose of treating males and females at NSP and NCW differently is \nintended to address the \"fact\" that such persons are not \"similarly situated\" because \nattributes not solely associated with gender may legitimately permit (if not require) \ndifferences in treatment, then different treatment of men and women at NSP and NCW is \njustified under the Equal Protection Clause, as a general principle, so long as the fact of \n\"dissimilarity\" is true. Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 354, 99 S.Ct. 1742, 1747, 60 \nL.Ed.2d 269 (1979) (\"In cases where men and women are not similarly situated, however, \nand a statutory classification is realistically based upon the differences in their situations, \nthis Court has upheld its validity.\"). \nIn Parham, the Court upheld a statute that required unmarried men, but not unmarried \nwomen, to legitimate their children in order to sue for the wrongful death of the children. The \n\nCourt found: \"The fact is that mothers and fathers of illegitimate children are not similarly \nsituated.\" Id. at 355, 99 1386*1386 S.Ct. at 1747. The Court believed this \"fact\" to be true \nbecause \"[u]nlike the mother of an illegitimate child whose identity will rarely be in doubt, \nthe identity of the father will frequently be unknown.\" Id. The Court found that the purpose \nbehind the statute — avoiding false claims by men for the wrongful death of children — was \nnot based upon an invidious premise. Id. at 355 & n. 7, 99 S.Ct. at 1748 & n. 7. \nAssuming dissimilarity in fact, the only remaining inquiry would be whether the means used \nto further the purposes behind the differences in treatment are rationally related to the \ngovernmental objective. Parham, 441 U.S. at 357, 99 S.Ct. at 1748 (\"Having concluded that \nthe Georgia statute does not invidiously discriminate against any class, we still must \ndetermine whether the statutory classification is rationally related to a permissible state \nobjective.\"). Having concluded that the purpose of the classification was not based upon \nfactors exclusively related to gender, but rather was based upon the difficulty in proving \npaternity as opposed to the difficulty in proving maternity, the Parham Court then inquired \nwhether the means used were rationally related to the purposes of the classification. Since \nthe means used — requiring men to acknowledge paternity — were rationally related to the \npurposes behind the differences in treatment — avoiding false claims by men — the rational \nbasis test was satisfied. \nThe \"rational basis\" test tolerates seemingly unwise decisions by the political branches of \ngovernment because of the Constitutional preference for democratic solutions as opposed \nto judicial ones. So long as there is no overarching constitutional reason to interfere — such \nas discrimination based upon characteristics that the victim can do nothing about, like race \nor gender — democratic, rather than judicial, solutions are to be preferred. As the Court \nstated: \"`The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even \nimprovident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and the judicial \nintervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political \nbranch has acted.'\" Parham, 441 U.S. at 351, 99 S.Ct. at 1746 (quoting Vance v. \nBradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 942-43, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)). \n2. Heightened Scrutiny \nThe Supreme Court has also stated that if the classification is based upon gender alone, \nthen an \"`exceedingly persuasive justification' [is] needed to sustain the genderbased \nclassification.\" Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 731, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 3340, \n73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982). Thus, if women at NCW are treated differently than men at NSP \nbecause they are women, a much more searching analysis is required. \nIn Hogan, the Court was confronted with the admissions policy of a nursing school that \nprohibited men from attending. The justification for the single-sex admission policy was the \nassertion that the state should be allowed to compensate for discrimination against women. \nThe Court first held that the party seeking to uphold the classification based upon gender \nmust carry the burden of showing two things. Id. at 724-25, 102 S.Ct. at 3336-37. The \nclassification must be shown to serve an important governmental objective. Id. at 724, 102 \nS.Ct. at 3336. If the classification is shown to serve an important governmental objective, \n\nthe discriminatory means chosen must be substantially related to the achievement of the \nobjective. Id. at 725, 102 S.Ct. at 3336. \nThe Court held that the state can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise \ndiscriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefitted by the classification \nactually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification. Id. at 728, 102 S.Ct. at 3338. The \nCourt then concluded that the nursing school failed to prove the first part of the test — the \nclassification was not shown to be based upon an important governmental objective. The \nCourt found this to be true because women had not in fact been disadvantaged by \ndiscrimination in the nursing field, and rather than compensating for discriminatory barriers \nfaced by women, the policy of excluding males furthered the stereotypical 1387*1387 view of \nnursing as women's work. Id. at 729, 102 S.Ct. at 3338. \nThe Court also found that the nursing school failed to satisfy the second part of the test; that \nis, the nursing school failed to establish that the policy of excluding men was substantially \nand directly related to the proposed compensatory purpose. Id. at 730, 102 S.Ct. at 3339. \nThe Court reached this conclusion because of the inconsistent policy of allowing men to \naudit nursing classes. Id. at 731, 102 S.Ct. at 3339-40. The Court was thus persuaded that \nthe \"record in this case is flatly inconsistent with the claim that excluding men ... is \nnecessary to reach any of [the nursing school's] educational goals.\" Id. at 731, 102 S.Ct. at \n3340. \n3. Heightened Scrutiny is the Proper Test \n(a) \nMost of the cases involving women's prisons have used the \"heightened scrutiny\" test. See, \ne.g., Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1455 (D.C.Cir.1989) (applying the heightened \nscrutiny test to prison policy of incarcerating female offenders outside of the District of \nColumbia, but finding that the test was satisfied, even though similarly situated males were \nincarcerated closer to the District of Columbia, because the difference in treatment was \nbased upon the need to respond to severe overcrowding problems and was not based upon \noutmoded concepts of the role of women in contemporary society); Canterino v. \nWilson (Canterino I), 546 F.Supp. 174, 209-12 (W.D.Ky.1982) (applying the heightened \nscrutiny test, and holding, among other things, that the state was required to show, but \nfailed to show, that disparate treatment of female inmates, which resulted in inferior \nprograms in areas of vocational education, training, and pay, was substantially related to \nimportant governmental objective); Glover v. Johnson, 478 F.Supp. 1075, 1079-83 \n(E.D.Mich.1979) (Glover I) (applying the heightened scrutiny test, and holding, among other \nthings, that state prison authorities must provide women inmates with treatment and \nfacilities that are substantially equivalent to those provided male inmates, but such \nauthorities offered women inmates markedly poorer educational and vocational programs in \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause).[11] \nThe most thoughtful analysis of why heightened scrutiny is appropriate in cases such as this \nis found in Judge Starr's[12] opinion in Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1453-1456. In Pitts, 1388*1388 the \ncourt applied the heightened scrutiny test because: (a) women offenders, because they \n\nwere women, were imprisoned considerably farther from the District of Columbia than \nsimilarly situated males, and were thus \"substantially burdened\";[13] (b) although courts \nshould be loath to substitute their judgments for that of prison officials, see Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (\"[w]hen a prison regulation \nimpinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests.\"), any case touching upon prisons necessarily \nimplicates Turner's concerns; (c) Turner applies to cases involving prison security or the \nday-to-day operation of prisons and the challenged policy did not involve either security \nconcerns or the day-to-day operation of prisons; (d) facial gender discrimination traditionally \nhas summoned heightened scrutiny because such distinctions are often based upon \ninaccurate stereotypes which increase the danger that the state has chosen means which \nare not related to legitimate state interests; and (e) heightened scrutiny is properly \nemployed where equal protection claims are at issue, as opposed to assertions of individual \nrights, because the right sought to be enforced is the right to be treated equally as opposed \nto challenges to limitations on personal rights which are often inherently limited by \nincarceration. \nThe court was careful to point out, however, that heightened scrutiny does not allow courts \nto disregard the special difficulties facing prison administrators. Id. at 1455. In this regard, \nthe court emphasized that the heightened scrutiny test did not eliminate an appreciation of \nthe difficulties that prison administrators face or the considerable limits of judicial \ncompetency. Id. \nApplying Pitts to this case, I am satisfied that heightened scrutiny is appropriate in this case \nas there is no doubt that women are incarcerated at NCW because of their gender and not \nfor some other reason. There is only one prison for women in the State of Nebraska. \nWhether a woman is convicted of writing bad checks or of murder, she will find herself at \nNCW when sentenced to prison. Men, on the other hand, could be sent to a variety of \ninstitutions depending upon a variety of penological goals — from security to programming. \nAs a consequence, despite the fact that nongender-related reasons may exist to justify \ntreating female prisoners differently from male prisoners, the fact remains that female \nprisoners, as a result of their gender alone, can receive only the programs available at \nNCW. Therefore, if the programming at NCW is comparatively inferior to programs at NSP, \nthe female recipients may receive poor programming because of their gender and not for \nsome nongender-related reason. \n(b) \nAt my request, the parties have devoted a great deal of effort to addressing the question of \nwhether the female inmates at NCW are \"similarly situated\" to their male counterparts at \nNSP.[14] As noted in the foregoing discussion of Parham, the Supreme Court has stated that \nwhere factors other than gender alone distinguish one class from another, the proper test to \nemploy is the so-called rational basis test. Parham, 441 U.S. at 354, 99 S.Ct. at 1747. I \nhave concluded that the inmates at NCW are \"similarly situated\" with the inmates at NSP for \nequal protection purposes for the following reasons. \nFirst, while inmates at NCW span the security continuum — from minimum to medium to \nmaximum — and inmates at NSP tend 1389*1389 to be at higher security levels — medium \n\nand maximum — inmates at both institutions are nevertheless inmates. At the most basic \nlevel, the inmates at both facilities are in similar situations — confined as a result of a \ncriminal conviction. \nSecond, since NCW spans the security continuum and houses maximum custody inmates, \nand since NSP also houses maximum custody inmates, it is likely that the court will be \ncomparing populations, aside from gender, which are classified as roughly comparable by \nthe State of Nebraska. In this regard, since there is no segregation between minimum \ncustody inmates and maximum custody inmates at NCW, minimum custody inmates receive \nthe same type of treatment as maximum custody inmates. Thus, it is not inconsistent to \ntreat both institutions as having roughly comparable populations. Stated another way, \nfemale minimum custody inmates are treated essentially the same as female maximum \ncustody inmates. Therefore, if it is appropriate to compare institutions housing female \nmaximum custody inmates with institutions housing male maximum custody inmates, then \nthe existence of lower custody status inmates at NCW is irrelevant. \nThird, as the court found in Glover I, \"I find no evidence on this record that the [State] views \nits general purpose in administering the [challenged] programs differently at [the female \nprison] than at male institutions.\" Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1082 (emphasis in original) \n(footnote omitted). In other words, although the state may have segregated men from \nwomen, there is no evidence to suggest the state thought that as a general matter the \npurposes of incarceration were different for men than for women. As a consequence, other \nthings being roughly equal, it is not inappropriate to consider NSP inmates and NCW \ninmates as \"similarly situated\" for equal protection purposes because the Nebraska \nlegislature has not defined different general purposes for the incarceration of offenders on \nthe basis of gender. \nFourth, much of the defendants' argument—that female inmates at NCW are not similarly \nsituated to their male counterparts at NSP[15] — is premised on a prior case from this court \ninvolving security and privacy issues. In point of fact, the United States Court of Appeals \nhas upheld a finding by this court that men and women incarcerated at NSP and NCW are \nnot \"similarly situated\" and, therefore, the Equal Protection Clause was not violated when \nthe State of Nebraska afforded lesser privacy protections to men as opposed to \nwomen. Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1103 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that differences in \nprivacy protections afforded male and female inmates in Nebraska prisons did not violate \nthe Equal Protection Clause because male and female inmates were not \"similarly situated\" \ndue to differences in security concerns having to do with the kinds of crimes committed, \nlength of sentence, and frequency of violence, escapes and contraband), cert. denied, ___ \nU.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2807, 115 L.Ed.2d 979 (1991). \nWhile security issues are at the periphery of every prison case, the differences in treatment \nbetween men and women in this case cannot honestly be attributed to issues of \nsecurity.[16] Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1454 (opining that the challenged policy did not \"directly \nimplicate either prison security or control of inmate behavior, nor does it go to the prison \nenvironment or prison regime.\").[17] By and 1390*1390 large, the policies under challenge \nhere have nothing to do with security. On the contrary, if anything, the relative lack of \nsecurity concerns at NCW, compared with NSP, makes at least some of the differences in \nprograms inexplicable if based upon security concerns.[18] \n\nFifth, a good deal of the defendants' argument is nothing more or less than a restatement of \nthe decision to segregate men from women in the first instance. I do not make light of this \npoint. Indeed, the Pitts court recognized, as I must also, that the plaintiffs have not \nchallenged the decision to segregate men from women. \nNevertheless, as the Pitts court stated, \"the existence of the facial classification raises \nsufficient concerns to trigger heightened scrutiny.\" Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1459. If there really are \nrelevant differences[19] between the men at NSP and the women at NCW, the place to take \naccount of those relevant differences is in that part of the \"heightened scrutiny\" analysis \nwhich tries to determine whether there is a sufficiently strong relationship between an \nimportant governmental objective and the means chosen to further that objective such that it \ncan be said that the challenged policies are not \"the product of traditional stereotyping or \narchaic notions of `appropriate' gender roles.\" Id.[20] In so doing, the court will be forced to \narticulate, and therefore justify by the process of articulation, differences which are \n\"constitutionally relevant\": \nRather than avoiding the issue of differences, courts should confront it directly; if they \ndetermine that sex differences have a role in the equal protection analysis, they must \narticulate a standard of what constitutes a relevant difference. In so doing, the courts should \nbe cautious in their identification of constitutionally relevant differences. In particular, they \nshould be wary of differences resulting from past discrimination. At a minimum, the \n\"similarly situated\" analysis should not encompass socially constructed differences or \ndiscrimination will be self-perpetuating. \nNote, Women's Prisons, 94 Yale L.J. at 1186-87 n. 22. \nB. General Application of the Heightened Scrutiny \nTest \n1. \nIt is wise to restate what the heightened scrutiny test requires me to do. It 1391*1391 must \nfirst be determined whether, as a matter of fact, programs (in quantity or quality) are \nprovided male inmates at NSP which are not provided to female inmates at NCW such that \nit can be found that the women suffer a \"substantial burden.\" Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1453 & n. 4. \nIf so, the test then requires that I determine what the defendants \"specifically asserted [to \nbe] the governmental interest that supports the contested policies.\" Id. at 1456. Once \nhaving established what the stated objective is, the court is required to ascertain whether \nthe objective is \"important,\" meaning that it is constitutionally legitimate. Id. Having \ndetermined the objective of the contested policy, and presuming that the governmental \nobjective is \"important,\" the next step is to decide whether the means chosen to further the \nobjective are \"directly and substantially related.\" Id. \nIn summary, the framework may be stated this way: (a) determine whether there are \nprograms (means) afforded (in quantity or quality) to male inmates at NSP but not female \ninmates at NCW which place a \"substantial burden\" on female inmates (disparity); (b) if so, \nascertain whether there is an important governmental objective (objective) which underlies \n\nthe \"means\"; (c) if so, finally decide whether the \"means\" chosen to further the \ngovernmental \"objective\" are directly and substantially related to the \"objective\" (relationship \nof means to objective) such that the \"disparity\" may be overlooked. \n2. \nThere are two questions which can and should be addressed as a threshold matter. The \nfirst question is whether the court should examine each program separately, or whether the \ncourt should examine the institutions as a whole, to determine whether in fact females suffer \na substantial burden. In other words, a question is presented as to whether the court should \ncompare NSP with NCW generally, or whether the court should compare NSP with NCW on \na program-by-program basis. As part of the first inquiry, if the court is to examine the \nprograms separately, it must also determine what standards should be employed to judge \nwhether women suffer a substantial burden. Secondly, if the court believes a program-by-\nprogram analysis is required, the next question is whether the asserted important \ngovernmental objective is the same for each program. I turn to those threshold questions \nnow. \n(a) \nI think it appropriate to examine the contentions of the parties on a program-by-program \nbasis. Although the parties have provided me with general overviews of NCW as compared \nto NSP,[21] each party ultimately relies upon a program-by-program comparative analysis for \nthe contention that women either do or do not suffer a substantial burden. Indeed, one of \nthe pretrial conference orders in this case appears to require a program-by-program \nanalysis. (Filing 409, compare plaintiffs' controverted issues at page 63 and following with \ndefendants' controverted issues at page 4 and following.)[22] The parties primarily rely on \nsuch a program-by-program analysis in their posttrial briefs. More basically, it would simply \nbe impossible to judge the plaintiffs' equal protection claim and the defendants' response \nthereto in a coherent fashion by trying to evaluate NSP and NCW across the board.[23] I \nshall therefore examine the equal protection claim on a program-by-program basis by \nseparately comparing each challenged program 1392*1392 at NCW with a similar program at \nNSP to determine whether female inmates suffer a substantial burden as to a particular \nprogram. \nWhen making a program-by-program analysis to determine whether female inmates at \nNCW suffer a substantial burden, it is important to keep two things in mind. \nFirst, the Equal Protection Clause does not require that NSP and NCW have identical \nprograms, but rather programs which are \"substantially equivalent.\"[24] Glover I, 478 F.Supp. \nat 1079 (\"equivalent in substance if not in form\"); see also Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at \n210 (\"[T]he equal protection clause requires parity, not identity, of treatment.\"); Bukhari v. \nHutto, 487 F.Supp. 1162, 1171-72 (E.D.Va.1980) (quoting unreported decision of Barefield \nv. Leach, No. 10282 (D.N.M.1974), \"`what the Equal Protection Clause requires in a prison \nsetting is parity of treatment, as contrasted with identity of treatment, between male and \nfemale inmates ...'\" and ordering further hearing on female inmates' claim of disparity of \ntreatment between conditions of confinement in maximum security setting for women \n\ncompared to men) (emphasis in original). On the other hand, programs are not \n\"substantially equivalent\" solely because each institution has similar programs if the \n\"programs said to be available to the female prisoners are inferior in design, execution, or \nboth.\" Glover IV, 721 F.Supp. at 837. \nSecond, expenditures of money, while of general relevance, do not substitute for reasoned \nanalysis. Glover III, 855 F.2d at 288-89 (Engel, C.J., concurring and stating, \"[t]he very \ndifference between the sexes may mean in a given situation that the delivery of \nrehabilitative services may necessarily require the varied expenditure of monies because of \nnatural differences in the sexes or in their conditions of confinement.\"). \nWomen's prisons tend to have much smaller populations than male prisons,[25] but size has \nlittle constitutional relevance. Indeed, the argument that women's prisons are small and \ntherefore expensive to run \"is, frankly, not a justification but an excuse for the kind of \ntreatment afforded women prisoners.\" Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1078. Or, as stated \nin Canterino I, \"[i]t is well established that economic considerations alone cannot serve as \nan excuse for failure to meet constitutional standards.\" 546 F.Supp. at 207. \nWomen are not more expensive to incarcerate than men just because they are women. \nRather, since prisons for women are small, it is difficult to achieve economies of scale \nsimilar to those in the larger prisons housing men. In fact, Mr. Falconer, who prepared much \nof the defendants' cost data, said that due to \"the economies of scale\" he was not surprised \nby the difference in costs between institutions which house men and women. (5223:25.) He \nattributed the difference in costs primarily to the difference in number of inmates, not some \nattribute of womanhood: \nQ. I was just looking for what factors that you're aware of that make the per capita cost [for \na] female inmate at NCW higher than a per capita cost at NSP for example? \nA. It's numbers. Numbers of inmates. \nQ. That is primarily the difference is that right? \nA. Yes. \n(5226:1-7.) \nIndeed, the lack of economies of scale can be seen in administrative salaries \nmeasured 1393*1393 by inmate-to-staff ratios. Mr. Falconer testified that \"70 to 72 percent of \nour budget etc. in the Department of Correctional Services are staff related costs.\" \n(5226:12-13.) If this is true, and staff-to-inmate ratios mean anything, NCW is spending \nmuch more, relatively speaking, per inmate on its administrative staff than NSP, but NCW \nspent, relatively speaking, about the same per inmate as NSP on support staff, security \nstaff, and total staff. (Ex. 1378.) \nFor example, in 1992 the inmate-to-staff ratio for administration at NCW was 16.00 to 1, \nwhereas the same ratio for NSP was 49.44 to 1. (Ex. 1378.) The administration category \nincluded \"the superintendent or warden's staff, the assistant warden, the business manager, \nbusiness [sic], the accounting people.\" (5170:8-10.) In effect, NCW had more administrative \nstaff per inmate than NSP and, therefore, administrative costs per inmate must have been \nhigher at NCW. On the other hand, in 1992 support staff ratios were similar (NCW = 9.93 \n\nand NSP = 10.14), and total staff ratios were similar (NCW = 2.03 and NSP = 2.22).[26] (Ex. \n1378.) This same trend was generally true for the preceding years as well. \nAt least in terms of staff salaries, the data would suggest that spending, as measured by \ninmate/staff ratios, was about the same for NCW and NSP except in the area of \nadministration. Moreover, if it is true that it takes more money to obtain the same level of \nservices for females as compared to males due to the smaller total size of the female \npopulation and the concomitant loss of economies of scale, this data may also suggest that \nNebraska is not spending sufficient monies on the support staff and total staff who work in \nits female prison if women are to receive parity of treatment. \nThus, spending is not a very good measure of equivalency.[27] Accordingly, I have not \nconcentrated on spending data. \n(b) \nHaving determined that a program-by-program analysis is required, I pause to consider \nwhether the defendants assert the same or different important governmental objectives for \nany differences that may exist between the programs at NCW and NSP. If the same \ngovernmental interest is asserted for each program, I can make a threshold determination \nof whether, assuming that female inmates are substantially burdened, the governmental \ninterest underlying the burden is \"important.\" If the governmental objectives change from \nprogram to program, then a separate determination of whether the objective is \"important\" \nwould be required for each program. \nProbably because they do not agree that this case warrants \"heightened scrutiny,\" the \ndefendants did not prior to trial, during trial, or after trial clearly articulate what they believed \nthe important governmental interests were. Therefore, it is not clear what governmental \nobjective may undergird the differences, if there be differences, in the various programs.[28] \n1394*1394 However, I have been able to ascertain from the evidence one important \ngovernmental objective that is an ever-present theme of the defendants even though not \narticulated in relationship to the \"heightened scrutiny\" test of any particular program. \nDefendants argue that male and female inmates are initially segregated for security \nreasons, and thereafter female inmates are treated differently because they have different \nneeds than males. (Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 8 (\"The testimony of all of the experts in this case \nconfirmed that the profile and thus the needs of female inmates differ significantly from the \nneeds of male inmates.\").) \nThe defendants contend, and plaintiffs do not generally disagree,[29] that the evidence \nshows that most women come to prison with fewer resources than most men. (Compare \nDefs.' Post-Trial Br. at 8-11 with Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 19: \"Indeed the plaintiffs presented \nevidence of a female offender `profile' which pointed out some of the different correctional \nneeds of women as opposed to incarcerated men.\") The following is a general description \nof the evidence as to the profile of female and male inmates. \n\nMany female inmates are passive to the point of dysfunction as they enter prison. Many \nfemale inmates come to prison after living at a low income level prior to incarceration. \nFemale inmates tend to lack job training and job-related education. Female inmates have \nsevere confidence problems and suffer from low self-esteem. Most of the female offenders \nare single parents responsible for supporting themselves who do not have contact with the \nsignificant males in their lives after incarceration; thus, the separation of mother and child is \nespecially traumatic. Female inmates tend to have poor living skills and little exposure to \nemployment opportunities, resulting in poor work skills and habits. \nMen, on the other hand, come to prison with greater resources than women. Male inmates \ntend to have been employed \"on the outside\" in higher-paying jobs compared to women. \nThe problem of low self-esteem tends to plague men less than women. Men tend to be less \nactively dependent. Most male inmates do not have responsibility for child rearing. Most \nmales tend to be comparatively more employable than women. \nHaving noted these \"differences,\" and realizing, as the parties evidently do, that the \n\"differences\" are largely the product of societal gender bias,[30] the question becomes \nwhether these differences are relevant to a legitimate and important governmental objective \nregarding the treatment of women prisoners. I conclude that these differences are relevant \nand, in fact, provide a legitimate and important governmental objective. The differences \nestablish that if the State of Nebraska had an important governmental objective in treating \nwomen differently, the important governmental objective was the remediation of effects of \ngender bias suffered by female inmates prior to their entry into prison in order that the \nNebraska prison system might better address its statutory mission of preparing inmates for \n\"lawful community living.\" Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-901 (Reissue 1987).[31] \n1395*1395 This remedial need has been identified by others, including the American \nCorrectional Association (ACA). In the ACA's publication entitled Public Correctional Policy \non Female Offender Services the following is forcefully noted: \nBecause of their comparatively small numbers, female offenders — both adults and \njuveniles, accused and adjudicated — have been virtually ignored in the justice system. \nWhile data suggest that female offenders are very receptive to rehabilitation programs and \nsupportive services, they seldom have access to such programs, and certainly not to the \nrange of services available to male offenders. \nSome female facilities and programs are excellent. Many, however, have never received the \nresources they need to offer parity of programs and services and to provide the necessary \ntraining to their staff. As a result, many institutions have had to simply \"hold\" their female \ninmates, providing few opportunities to them for constructive change. \nJustice professionals and the public should be made aware of the profound need for parity \nof resources and services for females. \n.... \nMore than half of the nation's workforce is now female. Most women who are convicted of \ncrimes held jobs before their conviction, yet most also were earning incomes below the \npoverty level. The majority of these women were also the sole support for themselves as \nwell as their children. Adequate academic education programs and occupational \nassessment and training for female offenders is therefore a critical need. \n\nTo successfully compete in a demanding job market, female offenders should receive the \nopportunity for suitable training, based on their interests and abilities, in both traditional and \nnon-traditional vocations. Many female offenders also lack the relevant lifeskills necessary \nfor successfully managing a household and being independent in a competitive and costly \nsociety. Whether in an institution or under community supervision, females should have an \nopportunity to acquire and practice these skills through instruction, counseling, and gradual \nrelease programs such as furloughs and pre-release. Work release programs should be \navailable so that female offenders can apply their training in a structured and supportive \nsetting. \n(Ex. 292, at 29-30 (emphasis added).)[32] \nClearly, Hogan stands for the proposition that remediation of past discrimination against \nwomen[33] is an important and legitimate governmental objective (if remediation is the real \ngoal). As the Court stated in Hogan: \"In limited circumstances, a gender-based \nclassification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members \nof the sex that is disproportionately burdened.\"[34] 458 U.S. at 728, 102 S.Ct. at 3338. \n1396*1396 I therefore find and conclude that the State of Nebraska may justify differential \ntreatment of females at NCW on a program-specific basis if the means chosen are directly \nand substantially related to the objective of providing women with remedial assistance so \nthat they may be better able to engage in \"lawful community living.\"[35] Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-\n901. Although there may be other ostensibly important governmental objectives, I can find \nno other such objectives that span the entire range of programs at issue in this lawsuit. As I \nmake the program-by-program analysis, if it is apparent to me that another governmental \nobjective may exist as to a specific program, I shall endeavor to discuss the objective in \nrelation to the specific program. I turn now to the challenged programs.[36] \nC. Employment/Economic \n1. Burden \nThe plaintiffs argue that they have been denied an equal opportunity to make money while \nincarcerated and to acquire vocational skills on the job. The plaintiffs challenge (a) the pay \npolicy, (b) the hobbycraft policy, (c) the private venture policy, (d) the Cornhusker State \nIndustries (CSI) policy, and (e) the state-paid work assignment policy. At this point in the \nanalysis, the sole question is whether inmates at NCW are \"substantially burdened\" by any \nof the policies. \n(a) \nAs to the hobbycraft policy, the private venture policy, and the state-paid work assignment \npolicy, I find that the female inmates at NCW have not suffered a substantial burden by \nvirtue of disparity of treatment, in policy or practice, when compared to inmates at NSP. \n\nAs to the hobbycraft policy, plaintiffs essentially contend that they have less of a market to \nsell their hobbycraft than the men at NSP. At NSP, inmates apparently can take orders to \nproduce hobbycraft items, while at NCW, the crafts must be purchased from a display case. \nWhile the policies are different, as noted earlier, they need not be identical. At bottom, both \nmale and female inmates may sell their hobbycraft, and the slight difference in policy does \nnot warrant further analysis. Indeed, this is probably the type of day-to-day operational \nconcern in which the court ought not to involve itself. Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1454. \nAs to the private venture policy, (see generally Exs. 232, 274, and 1346B, Interrog. 9), \nsome elaboration is necessary. At various times, at both NSP and NCW, private companies \nhave located their businesses at the institutions. The inmates at both institutions were then \nemployed by the private ventures. For the inmates, the attractive thing about the private \nventure jobs was that they paid the inmates a higher wage compared to other jobs at the \ninstitutions. \nSince June, 1990, when a telemarketing firm left, there has been no private venture at \nNCW, while there has been a private venture, a sewing factory, at NSP. The present \nsuperintendent of NCW testified that NCW was in the process of negotiating with a new \nprivate venture firm in the hopes of attracting such a firm to NCW. \nThere is simply no evidence to suggest that the defendants have adopted a policy or \npractice of pursuing or encouraging private venture employment for the men but not the \nwomen. The defendants are not responsible for a private business decision to cease \nbusiness. Although the women are practically burdened, and perhaps substantially so, \nby 1397*1397 the lack of a private venture job opportunity, the burden has not been caused \nby the action or inaction of the defendants. Therefore, the plaintiffs have not been burdened \nfor purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. \nAs to state-paid work assignments, (see generally Exs. 54, 220, 227, 228, 233, and 234, \n412 and 1346A, Interrog. 9), the plaintiffs claim they are not given the same type and \nnumber of jobs. \"State-paid work assignments\" are jobs an inmate performs for the state \nand for which the state pays the inmate. I do not find that the female inmates are \nsubstantially burdened by any policy or practice regarding the state-paid work assignments. \nWhile there may have been more categories of assignments at NSP than at NCW from time \nto time, the general policy was to provide the same types of assignments to both sets of \ninmates, and differences in the categories of work available were largely inconsequential. \nWhile the state-paid work assignments at NCW appear to be menial, boring, and not \nrelevant to the real world (see generally the testimony of inmates Blank and Anthony), there \nis no reason to believe that the inmates at NSP are substantially better off regarding the \nquality of the state-paid work assignments they receive. The same is true for quantity. For \nexample, there was testimony from one female inmate (Anthony) that when she asked for \nadditional state-paid work, she received it. \nThe NCW inmates argue that some NSP[37] inmates (trustees) were permitted to leave the \nsecurity perimeter of NSP to perform their state-paid work assignments, but the NCW \ninmates (who had similar minimum custody status) were not. The extent of this disparity is \nnot clear from the record, but it does not appear to be significant qualitatively or \n\nquantitatively. At least some of the NCW inmates were permitted to leave the security \nperimeter, if only to take out trash as part of their jobs. As to this issue, I find that the \nburden, if any, is so minimal on this record as to be inconsequential, and, in any event, this \nis an area where legitimate security and day-to-day operational concerns, clearly outside \nthe competency of the court, are implicated. Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1454. \n(b) \nI believe discussion of the CSI policy should be deferred for consideration in the section of \nthis memorandum on Education/Vocational Training. \n(c) \nAs to the pay policy, I find that the female inmates have been substantially burdened by the \npay policy. Before May, 1989, when the policy changed, inmates at NCW were paid on an \nhourly basis for their state-paid work assignments. If they worked an hour, they were paid \nfor an hour's work. In contrast, male inmates at NSP were paid for a day's work even if they \nworked only 15 minutes. The net impact was that females received substantially[38] less pay \nthan males for comparable work. For example, Ms. Klinger testified that she would have \nmade $41.30 more in February, 1989, had she been paid like a man. It is clear that the \ndefendants knew of the disparity no later than March, 1988, when a grievance was \nsubmitted, and perhaps as early as January, 1988, and yet 14 months elapsed before there \nwas any change. \n2. Important State Objective \nHaving determined that females suffered a substantial burden as a result of the pay policy \nwhich compensated women less than men for the same work, I must now determine \nwhether there are important governmental objectives which are said to warrant the policy, \nbeyond the legitimate and important remediation justification previously discussed. \nOnce again, the defendants are not clear about what legitimate state objective \nundergirds 1398*1398 the pay policy. The defendants claim that the policy of paying females \non an hourly basis was consistent with a normal work environment and, therefore, it was \nappropriate to pay females less than males on an hourly basis. It also appears that the \ndefendants claim the only reason men were paid on a daily basis was because it would \nhave been too costly to maintain any other accounting system for men, whereas for women \nit was easier, apparently because of their smaller numbers, to account for their work on an \nhourly basis. \nAs to the justification that women, as opposed to men, should be paid on an hourly basis \nbecause such a schedule is more like a normal work environment, I find the justification a \npretext. Even if it is not a pretext, the justification is not a legitimate governmental objective. \nNCW could then and can now pay women on an hourly basis and still pay the women an \neffective hourly rate that is equal to men. For example, if men at NSP working at a particular \njob were ostensibly paid $1.00 per hour, but worked only 4 hours and yet got paid $8.00 for \n\ntheir work, the effective hourly rate for the men would be $2.00 per hour. NCW could have \ncompensated females at the same effective hourly rate as males without sacrificing the \nhourly rate concept. \nAs the Court stated in Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 283, 99 S.Ct. 1102, 1113-14, 59 L.Ed.2d \n306 (1979), if the goal can be accomplished without gender classification, the gender-based \ngoal itself is not legitimate[39]: \nWhere, as here, the State's compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by \na gender-neutral classification as one that gender classifies and therefore carries with it the \nbaggage of sexual stereotypes, the State cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of \nsex. And this is doubly so where the choice made by the State appears to redound — if only \nindirectly — to the benefit of those without need for special solicitude. \nI do not accept the argument that it was too expensive (at least until the pay policy was \nchanged) to account for the time actually spent by the men, but it was less costly to do so \nfor the women, and therefore it was permissible to pay women less than men. Generally, \ncost, like other administrative excuses, Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 211 n. 9, 97 \nS.Ct. 1021, 1029 n. 9, 51 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977), is not a good enough reason to discriminate \non the basis of gender. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 211 (\"A desire to preserve the state's \nlimited resources cannot be used to justify an allocation of those limited resources which \nunfairly denies women equal access to programs routinely available to men.\") (citation \nomitted) (emphasis in original); Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. at 1172. \n3. Relationship Between Objective and Means \nHaving previously determined that the defendants would have an important governmental \nobjective in providing remedial services to women at NCW for past gender discrimination, \nthe question becomes whether the means chosen — the pay policy — to further that \nobjective are directly and substantially related. \nAs the Pitts court recognized, where the challenged policy \"directly responds to and entirely \ncorrelates with the more pervasive gender classification existing in both federal and state \nprison systems,\" the challenged policy may be upheld,[40] unless the record shows the \nchallenged policy to be the product of traditional stereotyping or archaic notions of \n\"appropriate\" gender roles. 866 F.2d at 1459. The pay policy fails the Pitts test on both \ncounts. \nFirst, paying women less than men does not \"directly respond\" and \"correlate\" to \nthe 1399*1399 \"pervasive\" policy of segregation of women from men in prison.[41] It is as easy \nto segregate men from women in prison and pay them equally as it is to segregate men \nfrom women in prison and pay them unequally. \nSecond, paying women less than men for equivalent work is perhaps the hallmark of \ntraditional stereotyping and archaic notions of \"appropriate\" gender roles. Such a policy \nproclaims that women, because they are women, are worth less in the marketplace than \nmen. In fact, such a policy only serves to perpetuate such unfortunate notions, and conflicts \n\nwith the goal of providing remediation for the effects of gender bias suffered by female \ninmates prior to their entry into prison in order that the Nebraska prison system might better \naddress its statutory mission of preparing inmates for \"lawful community living.\" \nNeb.Rev.Stat. § 83-901 (Reissue 1987). \nI therefore conclude that there is no relationship between the important governmental \nobjective — remediation — and the means chosen — the pay policy. In fact, the objective \nand the means are contradictory. Thus, plaintiffs have established a violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause regarding the pay policy.[42] \nD. Educational/Vocational Training \n1. Burden \nThe plaintiffs challenge for lack of equality some of the educational and vocational training \npolicies at NCW as compared to NSP.[43] The challenges pertain to: (a) the postsecondary \nacademic policy, (b) the vocational training (including preemployment) policy, and (c) the \nprerelease education policy. I conclude that plaintiffs suffer, and have suffered, a substantial \nburden in all three areas, although I do not think the burden is quite as extensive as \nplaintiffs contend. Since all three areas are fairly complex factually, I shall discuss them \nseparately in some detail. \n(a) Academic \nThe challenge to the postsecondary academic policy involves both the lack of on-site \npostsecondary academic programs and the relative lack of quality of such on-site programs \nas were offered. The challenge also implicates restrictions regarding correspondence \ncourses. \n(1) \nI turn first to the challenge to the on-site programs or lack thereof. The postsecondary on-\nsite academic policy issue requires review of two separate time frames — before October, \n1990, and after October, 1990. \nBefore October, 1990, a male inmate at NSP could receive an accredited on-site post-\nsecondary education offered through South East Community College (SECC). (See \ngenerally Ex. 34, at 51-53.) Between 14 and 17 separate courses were offered. This course \nof study could lead the male inmate to a certificate, associate degree, or diploma in \nbusiness administration. \nDuring the same time frame, a female inmate could only receive college instruction by \ncorrespondence courses, (Ex. 34, at 52), which correspondence courses were also \navailable to men. This led Dr. Ryan, then a consultant to the State of Nebraska, and later an \nexpert witness for the defendants, to warn in May, 1989, that \"[t]he lack of opportunity for \ncollege courses for women is a matter which has been the subject of litigation in other \n\nstates.\" (Ex. 34, at 38.) Ryan concluded that Standard 020 of the Correctional Education \nAssociation which \"required institutions housing female inmates to \nprovide 1400*1400 educational programs\" had been violated. (Ex. 34, at 65.) \nIn this connection, defendants endeavored to prove that the lack of postsecondary \neducational offerings was the fault of the inmates, and, at least implicitly, no practice or \npolicy of the defendants burdened the inmates. Essentially, the defendants presented proof \nthat NCW inmates were offered the opportunity to sign up for college courses to be taught \nby instructors from Peru State College, but not enough students showed an interest in the \nprogram. \nI have carefully considered this evidence, but do not find it persuasive. First, the inmates \nwere led to believe that they had to pay $33.00 per credit hour in advance without financial \nassistance, with six hours required. (Ex. 5000G.) Second, the proposed teachers were \neither high school teachers or a disliked NCW staff member. I note that staff members at \nNCW were initially interested in the proposed program, but later refused to sign up in \nsufficient numbers as well. Third, the offerings by Peru State College were not as extensive \nas those offered at NSP, and the administrators of DCS were not involved in initiating or \narranging the proposed program. \nThere is simply no question that there were inmates at NCW who wanted to take college \ncourses for credit. There is also no question that there were women at NCW who were fully \ncapable of doing college-level work. For example, Ms. Lange had studied at the University \nof Nebraska and Northeast Community College before being imprisoned. Before arriving at \nNCW, Ms. Brown-Cortes had attended two colleges, and after leaving NCW, she completed \nthe environmental laboratory program at SECC. In my opinion, the fact that NCW \nsubsequently offered on-site college courses rebuts any claim that the failure to provide \ncollege courses was somehow based upon a lack of interested and able students. \nDefendants raise two related arguments in an effort to establish either that the females were \nless capable of doing college work than the males, or that the females would not stay at the \ninstitution long enough to do college work. I am not convinced by either argument. Each \nargument disregards the fact that NCW later elected to offer college courses taught by \nSECC, and this fact effectively rebuts the argument that the women were not capable or \nthat they would not stay long enough. Moreover, for the reasons indicated below, I am not \npersuaded that the facts support the defendants' arguments. \nDefendants argue in their brief that since \"60 percent of the NSP population had either 12 \nyears of education or a GED\" but the females at NCW on \"average tested [at a] grade level \nof approximately the seventh grade ... a rational basis exists for the emphasis on basic \neducation at NCW.\" (Defs.' Reply Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 20-21.) \nIt appears that the defendants are not factually correct in absolute or relative terms. For \nexample, while there is evidence that the average tested grade level for female inmates at \none point was 7.37, (Ex. 783), the trial testimony of Ms. Axdahl, the person responsible for \nacademic testing at NCW, was that the inmates at NCW tested near the ninth grade in \nschool (8.9), and, accordingly, scored well above the sixth-grade level which was the adult \nnational average for reading. In fact, in answer to one of my questions, Ms. Axdahl stated \n\nthat as a \"community of inmates [8.9 is] pretty good.\" (3227:21-25.) Significantly, she \nthought that 25 percent is \"probably [a] real close estimate\" for the number of inmates who \ncould do college work at NCW. (3213:10-14.) \nAlso, defendants place a great deal of stock in the fact that apparently 60 percent of the \nmale inmates at NSP had a GED or had been in school for 12 years. (Ex. 448, Education at \nAdmission.)[44] However, it is incorrect 1401*1401 to compare years of school attended with \ntest scores — the former simply measures the number of years in school and the latter \nachievement. Unless one knows the tested grade level of the male inmates, no realistic \ncomparison of abilities can or should be made. The evidence does not reveal the tested \ngrade level for male inmates. \nStill further, the evidence relied upon by defendants, (Ex. 783), also reveals that on average \nthe females attained the 11th grade prior to commitment. Accordingly, the difference in \ngrade levels attended (12th grade vs. 11th grade) between the two inmate populations is \ninsignificant (assuming the doubtful utility of that comparison in the first place).[45] \nDefendants next argue that because the average length of stay of the female inmates was \nless than 13 months, (Ex. 783 (12¾ months)), whereas the average length of stay for the \nmales was 54 months, most of the women would not benefit from college course work. Thus \nit is argued that defendants had a reason for not providing on-site college course work to \nthe females. I conclude that the \"average length of stay\" figures are also of doubtful utility. \nAt the outset, it is difficult to understand the argument of the defendants since male \ninmates, regardless of length of stay, could enroll in college work. Thus, it is difficult to \nunderstand the rationale for denying females the opportunity to do college work based upon \na factor that was not employed for males. In this regard, the defendants have shown me no \ncomparative data from which I could conclude either that NSP provided course work only to \n\"long-time\" inmates or, conversely, that NSP's experience with \"short-time\" inmates in \ncollege classes was not satisfactory. Therefore, the \"length-of-stay\" argument is \nspeculative. \nFurther, the difference in \"length of stay\" between NCW inmates and \"medium\" custody \nNSP inmates was small. The \"medium\" custody male group at NSP was probably \"most \nlike\" the females at NCW. For example, in June, 1990, (Ex. 1385), the data showed: (a) \ninmates staying 24 months or less: NSP (medium) 70.7% vs. NCW 82.4%; (b) inmates \nstaying 18 months or less: NSP (medium) 61.5% vs. NCW 74.3%; (c) inmates staying 12 \nmonths or less: NSP (medium) 50.6% vs. NCW 66.9%. Even if one looks at the maximum \ncustody inmates at NSP, one out of five inmates stayed 12 months or less. Id. Indeed, \nnearly 40% of the NSP maximum custody inmates stayed 24 months or less. Since college \ncourse work was offered to these male inmates regardless of \"length of stay,\" it seems fair \nto conclude that \"length of stay\" was not a factor in offering college work at NSP. \nAlso, Dr. Ryan, who found that NCW violated an educational standard regarding \"equity,\" \n(Ex. 34, at 65), observed that in 1989 female inmates at NCW had sentences ranging from \none year to life, (Ex. 34, at 49), and that the female inmates had no on-site college courses. \n(Ex. 34, at 53.) In contrast, she also observed that at one male institution with lower custody \nstatus inmates, (all minimum), and where the inmates had an average length of stay of \n\nabout 18 months, (Ex. 34, at 48), 93 males were enrolled in 18 college courses. If 93 \ninmates at OCC enrolled in 18 college courses, then it is apparent that the \"short length of \nstay\" for the males (18 months) was not an inhibiting factor.[46] This 1402*1402 being true for \nOCC, with lower custody status inmates than NCW, there is no reason to believe that it \nwould not also have been true for NCW, given the average length of stay of about 13 \nmonths. Indeed, the data shows that slightly more than 25% of the females stayed longer \nthan 18 months, and nearly 1 out of 5 female inmates stayed longer than 24 months. (Ex. \n1385.) Thus, a significant number (25%) of the female population at NCW stayed longer \nthan the average inmate at OCC, yet OCC, like NSP, and unlike NCW, offered on-site \ncollege work to its males with little evident difficulty.[47] \nThe failure to offer on-site postsecondary education at NCW substantially burdened inmates \nat NCW. \n(2) \nAfter October, 1990, the women at NCW were offered on-site courses taught by SECC \ntoward a certificate in secretarial technology, but not a degree or diploma. It is noteworthy \nthat this offering took place about the same time this case was first set for trial. The \nsoftware to run the computers necessary to teach at least an important portion of the \nsecretarial technology courses for college credit was not available at the time trial started in \nJuly, 1992. Indeed, when Mr. Bomberger testified on August 4, 1992, he stated: \"We are in \nthat process now.\" (1982:5-10.) In fact, Bomberger indicated that the reason the business \nadministration courses could not be offered at NCW as at NSP was because of the lack of \nsufficient computers: \nQ. Is there a reason why you did not [offer] the business administration program that you \nhad at NSP at NCW? \nA. At the time, the business administration program had two computer classes in the first \ntwo quarters that we were offering and with only two computers, it would have been difficult \nto offer a business program. \n(1973:2-8.) \nDuring this same time frame (after October, 1990), NSP was offering the same business \nadministration program to males that it had offered prior to October, 1990. As noted earlier, \nthat program offered not only certificates, but also degrees. \nAfter college courses were offered at NCW, the women were still substantially burdened as \ncompared to male inmates at NSP regarding postsecondary education. First, the courses \nwhich were offered at NCW could not lead to a degree, while the men could obtain a degree \nat NSP. Second, without adequate computer resources, the courses which were offered \nwere not adequate when compared to the evident availability of operational computers at \nNSP. \nAs to the first point, defendants argue that there is no burden on the females regarding the \nlack of a degree program because few inmates (perhaps no more than 17) stay more than 3 \n\nyears at NCW. Defendants also argue that since no one has yet completed the certificate \nprogram at NCW it is advisable to wait to offer a degree program. \nI am not persuaded. Given the small number of inmates at NCW, 17 inmates constitute a \nfairly large percentage of the total population. In fact, it appears that one out of five inmates \nstay longer than 24 months. (Ex. 1385.) In this regard, there is no showing that more than 3 \nyears is required to complete a program leading to a degree (like most community colleges, \nSECC does not offer a bachelors degree). Finally, the testimony of defendants Director \nClark and Assistant Director Tewes that they will consider a degree program after an NCW \ninmate completes the certificate program disregards (and tends to perpetuate) the historical \ndisparity which existed at NCW. \nThe defendants have no convincing response as to the question of burden and the lack of \ncomputers. \nPlaintiffs also argue that they are burdened because the secretarial course is a \"traditionally \nfemale\" course of study. Implicitly, plaintiffs argue that they are burdened because they lack \nthe same program in business administration as the males at 1403*1403 NSP. However, I do \nnot find that the offering of secretarial technology but not business administration was a \nsubstantial burden, even though that course of study may properly be classified as \ntraditionally female. As noted earlier, NCW was not obligated to offer identical programs. \nIn this case, a crude needs assessment was conducted, and that needs assessment \nestablishes, to my satisfaction, that the secretarial technology course was responsive to \nmany of the felt needs of the inmates. (Ex. 766.) Although it can be persuasively argued \nthat the study was not the reason the secretarial course was in fact offered, the secretarial \ncourse is nonetheless responsive, particularly given the good participation rate of the \nfemale inmates. I also note that the SECC representative frequently surveys the NCW \nstudents to determine their needs with the result that some business administration courses \nare now being offered. Finally, I note that many of the secretarial technology classes are \ntransferable as part of a basic curriculum in a variety of other SECC programs (including \nbusiness). \n(3) \nI turn next to the issue of burden regarding correspondence courses. Inmates at NSP could \ntake correspondence courses for college credit, with some limited screening to insure the \nstudent had a chance at success, but there were no special prerequisites. On the other \nhand, inmates at NCW (at least up until SECC came on campus) were required to take and \ncomplete extensive prerequisites consisting of independent study course work in one of four \nareas, which was graded by the ABE/GED teachers, in addition to writing a paper based \nupon library materials the staff had compiled. The NCW prerequisites were required even if \nthe inmate had done prior college work. \nFor example, Ms. Vrtatko testified that she attempted to take a correspondence course. She \nwas informed that she had to take and complete certain high school courses. At first she \ntook what courses she thought were required. She was then informed that she would have \nto take biology. She took and passed the biology course. She was then required to write a \n\nresearch paper. At that point, Vrtatko became frustrated, did not do the research paper, and \nthus could not take the correspondence course. No more than four or five women were able \nto take correspondence courses from 1986 through 1990. \nThe prerequisites to the college correspondence courses, particularly during the time there \nwere no on-site college courses taught at NCW, substantially burdened the female inmates \ngiven the fact that there were no similar prerequisites for males at NSP. There has been no \nconvincing explanation as to why the inmates at NCW were required to take and pass the \nprerequisites when the males at NSP were not. \n(4) \nIn summary, in the academic area I find and conclude that: \n1. Prior to October, 1990, the failure to offer on-site postsecondary education at NCW \nsubstantially burdened inmates at NCW, given the fact that such offerings were available to \nmales at NSP; \n2. After October, 1990, the failure to offer on-site postsecondary education to females at \nNCW which would lead to a degree and the failure to have a sufficient number of \noperational computers substantially burdened the female inmates, given the fact that male \ninmates at NSP could pursue on-site degree programs with operational computers; \n3. Although traditionally female in nature, the secretarial technology course at NCW did not \nsubstantially burden females at NCW because it was generally responsive to surveyed \ninmate needs, the SECC representative frequently surveys inmate needs, some business \ncourses are now being offered, and some of the courses which are offered constitute core \ncourses for other areas of study (including business); \n4. The prerequisites to the college correspondence courses, particularly during the time \nthere were no on-site college courses taught at NCW, substantially burdened the female \ninmates, given the fact that there were no similar prerequisites for males at NSP. \n (b) Vocational \n1404*1404\nI turn next to the challenged vocational training (including preemployment) policy. Once \nagain, the vocational training policy is made up of components, some of which changed \nover time. The components challenged by the plaintiffs are the so-called clerical arts \nvocational education program, and the CSI employment policy, including preemployment \ntraining. \n(1) \nTurning first to the clerical arts program, there are two time frames which must reviewed — \nbefore and after July 1, 1991. I turn first to the period before July 1, 1991. \nBefore July 1, 1991, NCW offered vocational education to its inmates through an \nunaccredited program entitled \"clerical arts\" and later \"business education.\" The \"clerical \narts\" program was the only vocational education program offered at NCW, with the \n\nexception of a horticulture program that was offered for about one year during 1990 and \n1991. The clerical arts program offered training to NCW females so they might work in an \noffice. The clerical arts program could not be taken for college credit. In contrast, males at \nNSP during this period of time could receive vocational training in either culinary arts or \nwelding. Those courses were taught by instructors from SECC. Unlike the NCW clerical arts \nprogram, the culinary arts and welding programs at NSP could be taken for college credit. \nThe female inmates complain that they were substantially burdened during this time frame \nbecause the \"clerical arts\" program was qualitatively poor, not taught by an accredited \ninstitution from which college credit could be received, stereotypical as compared with the \nprograms at NSP, and limited as to available options as compared to NSP. \nAs a general matter, I do not believe the inmates at NCW were burdened because the \nclerical arts program was qualitatively poor when compared with the vocational programs at \nNSP. By and large, the evidence reveals that the clerical arts program was based upon a \nsolid curriculum, was taught or supervised by good teachers (particularly Ms. Axdahl), and \nwas generally responsive to the needs of inmates who desired clerical arts vocational \ntraining. To the extent that the \"experts\" can be believed, they generally thought the \nvocational educational program at NCW, particularly in the later stages of its development, \nwas adequate. \nHowever, there is evidence to suggest that the clerical arts program, at least until about \nJuly, 1990, lacked sophisticated computer equipment, particularly software. And, unlike \n\"secretarial technology,\" which obviously sought to develop significant proficiency beyond \nthat necessary for an entry-level position, Ms. Axdahl testified that the goal of the clerical \narts program was more modest. She believed that the goal was to train the inmates for \nentry-level positions. Drawing from a conference with employers, Ms. Axdahl believed that \nfrom a vocational education perspective, learning \"very basic\" computer skills — \"knowing \nhow to turn off and on a computer, what a disc drive is, what a disc is, what a monitor is\" — \nwas the appropriate type of program. (3076:18-21.) Thus, it does not appear that the lack of \ncomputer equipment rendered the clerical arts program unable to satisfy its modest goals. \nThis being true, one should remember that the inquiry here for equal protection purposes is \non comparative quality. I am unwilling to conclude that because its goal was modest the \nclerical arts program was qualitatively poor as a result of lack of computer equipment when \ncompared with the culinary arts or welding programs, both of which also sought to provide \nentry-level training (when not taken for a college degree). \nI do believe, on the other hand, that the women at NCW were substantially burdened in two \nareas compared to the men at NSP. The men had the opportunity to pursue a varied \nvocational education program — culinary arts or welding. The women were limited to \nclerical arts, an admittedly traditional field for females. The men were taught through SECC \nand could receive college credit for their vocational training. In fact, they could receive \ndegrees from the programs. (Exs. 167 and 168.) The women were not taught by SECC and \ncould not receive college credit or degrees for their vocational training. With perhaps the \nexception 1405*1405 of a typing course, none of the \"clerical arts\" courses could be used for \nSECC credit when SECC started teaching \"secretarial technology.\" \nIn sum, during this time frame the women were burdened because they lacked the range of \noptions that were made available to the men in vocational education. They had only one \n\ncourse to choose from and they could not receive college credit (or a degree) for their \nvocational efforts.[48] \nDr. Ryan, who was, as noted above, a consultant to the State of Nebraska and later one of \nits expert witnesses in this case, opined in May, 1989, that the \"vocational program for \nfemale offenders was inadequate,\" (Ex. 34, at 69), inasmuch as \"there was only one \nvocational program for women and this was the traditional clerical arts or office \noccupations.\" (Ex. 34, at 65-66.) Dr. Ryan warned that the limited opportunity for women \n\"has been addressed in court cases in other states in which inequity for female inmates has \nbeen charged.\" (Ex. 34, at 38.) \nThe defendants do not address the significance of the inability of the females to pursue \ncollege credit for their vocational training. However, they do make a number of arguments \nsuggesting that women were not burdened by the limited opportunities for vocational \ntraining at NCW compared to what was available to the men at NSP. Those arguments are: \nNCW previously offered vocational programs (truck-driving and apprentice programs) but \nthe women were not interested; the women receive prevocational programs which are not \noffered to men; a greater percentage of women participate in vocational programs than \nmen, and men are idle and women are not; and per capita spending is greater for vocational \nprograms for women than it is for men. I turn to those arguments now. \nDefendants argue that NCW had offered truck-driver training (1978-1980) and apprentice \nprograms (the last inmate left the program in 1987) in the past. Defendants point out that \nnot enough female inmates successfully completed these programs for the programs to \nremain in place. From this fact, the defendants argue that the limited option (clerical arts) \navailable to the inmates at NCW was caused by lack of inmate interest in other types of \ntraining. I am not persuaded by the truck-driving and apprentice evidence. \nThe truck-driving evidence was sketchy at best. While there was evidence that few inmates \ncompleted the program, there was also evidence that a fairly large number of individuals \ntook the courses. Moreover, it is not surprising that few people would complete the truck-\ndriving program given the fact, as one expert noted, that it would be difficult to get a job \ndriving a truck with a felony criminal conviction. \nAs to the apprentice program, I think the evidence strongly suggests two things. First, the \napprentice program was probably too difficult (for males or females). Two, Dr. Ryan \nsuggested in 1989 that the apprentice program for females be reactivated, (Ex. 34, at 40), \nwhich further confirms the relative need at NCW for more vocational options. NCW did not \nsee fit to do so. \nMost importantly, the evidence shows that when NCW adopted the horticulture program as \nan alternative to clerical arts, the program was very successful. Thus, when NCW had a \nproperly designed course as an alternative for clerical arts the inmates were very interested. \nAs a consequence, the \"lack of interest\" argument is not persuasive. \nDefendants also argue that the women received \"prevocational\" training that was not \noffered to the men. By implication, the defendants seem to argue that this prevocational \n\ntraining should substitute for the lack of options at the vocational level. I am not persuaded \nby this argument either. \nThe prevocational training — one course in living skills and one course in parenting \n— 1406*1406 was excellent.[49] In fact, the parenting course—called by the acronym of \nMOLD for Mother Offspring Living Development — was a truly outstanding program by all \naccounts. But these courses were not vocational by definition. These programs addressed \nneeds, but not, at least directly, vocational needs. For comparative purposes, the relevant \nquestion focuses on the vocational opportunities for women compared to men, and not \nsome other opportunity no matter how otherwise significant.[50] \nTo the extent the defendants argue that the prevocational training precluded offering \noptions for vocational training to women, I find there is no credible evidence to support such \na contention. Indeed, the success of the horticulture program disproves such an argument. \nFinally, defendants rely upon statistics for their argument that the women are not burdened. \nThey argue that a greater percentage of women as compared to men received vocational \ntraining, and that the State of Nebraska spent more on a per capita basis for vocational \ntraining for females than for men. I am not persuaded by these statistics. \nAs to the fact that a larger percentage of women have taken advantage of the vocational \ntraining than men, such a statistic is not helpful because the order of magnitude is quite \nsmall. The statistic also fails to account for the differences between the programs at NSP \nand NCW. The statistic further fails to account for the large proportion of men who simply \nwould rather be idle. At most, the statistic may show that the women at NCW were more \nmotivated than the men at NSP to achieve vocational education. \nThe evidence reveals that about 14% of the women at NCW and 7% of the men at NSP \ntook advantage of vocational programs. (Ex. 34, at 50.) The order of magnitude between \nthe two percentage numbers tells me very little. When the numbers are scrutinized more \nclosely, they may in fact tend to confirm the disparity. \nFor example, 7% of 560 NSP inmates, (Ex. 34, at 47), is about 40 inmates, whereas 14% of \n112 NCW inmates, (Ex. 34, at 48), is about 16 inmates. Thus, about 2.5 times as many \ninmates participated in the two programs at NSP which offered college credit than \nparticipated in the one program at NCW which offered no college credit. If the statistic \nshows anything, it tends to show that the women were quite motivated to pursue fewer \noptions. \nMoreover, the programs at NSP take more time to complete than the clerical arts program \nat NCW. The clerical arts program involved attending class 2 hours a day and was \nessentially a self-study course. (Ex. 34, at 49.) The welding course was full time and lasted \nabout 9 months. (Ex. 34, at 47.) The culinary arts program was a full-time course and took \nabout a year to complete. (Ex. 34, at 47.) Thus, an NSP inmate would have to forego all \nother activities in order to pursue vocational education, whereas an NCW inmate would not. \nIt is not surprising, therefore, that relatively greater numbers of inmates at NCW could take \nadvantage of a course of vocational education in clerical arts which was much less \ndemanding from a time standpoint than the vocational courses at NSP. \n\nStill further, any comparison of inmate activity must take into account the fact that large \nnumbers of inmates at NSP simply did not want to be active. The warden at NSP testified. \nHe told me: \n[T]here's 25 to 30% of the population that aren't interested in working anywhere close to a \nsix or eight hour day and will work in some cases only because we have assigned them to \nwork. They are not given a choice, and that many of those simply want to do the minimum \nthey have to do in a given job so that they have 1407*1407 satisfied the minimum expected \nof them and be onto things they might otherwise be interested in. \n(5157:7-15.) \nIf 25% to 30% of the NSP inmates did not want to work anything close to a 6- or 8-hour day, \nthey clearly would have no interest in vocational education which required a full-time \ncommitment. Thus, the statistic offered by the defendants is misleading. \nThe warden's testimony also reveals the tenuous nature of the raw data offered by the \ndefendants. If one excludes 30% of the inmates from the calculation on inmate utilization of \nvocational programs at NSP, the percentage of male inmates using vocational programs \nincreases by over 45% — from about 7% of the population to about 10% of the \npopulation.[51] \nOf additional interest is the fact that the 30% of the male inmate population at NSP who do \nnot want to work anything close to a 6- or 8-hour day exceeds in number the total inmate \npopulation at NCW during the time the statistic was derived (168 vs. 112). Thus, on a given \nday, there are more inmates at NSP who do not wish to be busy than there are total \ninmates at NCW. Therefore, the fact that a relatively large percentage of female inmates \nwanted vocational education attests to the strong motivation of the females as compared to \nthe males. It is this motivation, not some perceived equality of programming, that probably \naccounts for the larger percentage of women than men pursuing vocational education. \nFor similar reasons, I discounted almost entirely the data on \"idleness.\" The defendants \nprovided statistical evidence that nearly 100% of the female inmates were busy during the \nday, while something approaching 60% of the male inmates at NSP were \"idle\" during the \nday. This survey, which appeared to be hurriedly prepared (conducted the day before the \nwitness testified at trial), was offered in an evident attempt to show that the females \nreceived more of all kinds of programming than the males, including vocational education, \njobs, schooling and the like. \nThe person who prepared the report stated that males who went to school half time and \nworked half time were counted in the statistic as \"idle.\" For purposes of the study, a male \ninmate would be \"active\" only if he went to school or a job full time (at least 6 hours), but he \nwould not be \"active\" if he went to a job half time and school half time. It is difficult to \ndetermine whether the witness followed the same methodology at NCW. \nI have two serious reservations about the validity of the \"idleness\" study. First, the study \ndoes not account for male inmates who do not want to be active (as much as 30% of the \npopulation at NSP). Second, the study uses an artificial definition of \"idle,\" counting as idle \n\ninmates who went to school half time or worked half time, or performed some combination \nof work and schooling. As to this second point, the number of inmates who worked or went \nto school on less than a full-time basis is not revealed by the study, but it may be as much \nas the majority of inmates. (\"Most people in the adult male institutions are in school one, \ntwo, three hours the majority, so they would not be included in those that worked six \nhours.\") (4230:25-4231:3.) \nI also note that this \"idleness\" data could be contradicted by Dr. Ryan's 1989 study. Dr. \nRyan found that at NCW no more than 16 inmates were working, and the number involved \nin full-time schooling was 12. (Ex. 34, at 49.) Thus, at NCW, during 1989, if one employed \nthe same methodology used by the defendants, 75% of the females were \"idle\" (28 divided \nby 112). Using Dr. Ryan's data again for NSP, one finds that NSP apparently provided full-\ntime jobs or full-time schooling for 247 inmates, or more than 8 times more opportunities for \nfull-time jobs or schooling than provided by NCW. (Ex. 34, at 47 (112 working at private \nventure, 100 working at CSI, 15 full time at school, 20 1408*1408 inmates full time at welding \nor culinary arts).)[52] \nMore fundamentally, the defendants' \"idleness\" data tells me almost nothing about whether \n\"idleness\" was a factor in programming decisions at NSP, NCW, or both. If the data tells me \nanything, it tells me that the women are motivated to take advantage of the programming \nmade available to them. \nI briefly turn next to the question of per capita spending. Defendants argue that the \nexpenditure per inmate for vocational education greatly favored females. (Ex. 1378.) But, as \nnoted previously, per capita spending is not a good measure of \"parity\" because of the \nrelatively small numbers of female inmates compared to male inmates. \nAs to the specifics regarding the cost of vocational education, these costs include expenses \nfor \"Living Skills\" and \"MOLD\" which I have previously found are not vocational in nature. As \na consequence, even setting aside the inherent difficulty of comparing costs given the \ndifference in size of the two institutions, the data includes costs for nonvocational programs. \nTherefore, the defendants' cost data wrongly inflates the per capita costs to an unknown \ndegree. \n(2) \nI next address the period of time from and after July 1, 1991. Due to a cut in budgets after \nJuly 1, 1991, all \"vocational\" programs at NSP were eliminated. The horticulture program at \nNCW was terminated, but NCW was allowed to keep its clerical arts/business education \nprogram. Apparently, NCW was allowed to keep its clerical arts/business education \nprogram because this program also served to provide \"preemployment\" training for workers \nwho were employed to provide data-entry services for CSI. \nAlthough plaintiffs fear that vocational education will be provided to male inmates through \n\"pilot\" projects at various CSI ventures, thereby denying the females equal opportunity for \nvocational education, there is no convincing evidence of such activity at present. \nAccordingly, since NCW maintained at least one vocational education program, and NSP \n\nnone, I find that the females were not substantially burdened for vocational education \npurposes after July 1, 1991. \n(3) \nThe NCW inmates challenge the way they are dealt with by the prison industries program \nknown as CSI when compared to how the NSP men are dealt with by CSI. CSI is operated \nby DCS. CSI is not a corporation but is treated \"as any other program within the \ndepartment.\" (5196:18-19.) In essence, CSI provides goods and services, produced through \ninmate labor, to other state agencies and subdivisions of state government. The female \ninmates complain that they are treated inequitably because they have fewer quality \noptions[53] for employment, and because they either were not provided with preemployment \ntraining or the training was relatively poor compared with that provided the men. \nIt is true that the men have a greater number of employment options through CSI than the \nwomen. At NSP, men could work at CSI shops dealing with furniture, welding, license plates \n(seasonal), braille, paint, soap and printing. At NCW, women could work at either a sewing \nshop or a data-entry shop. \nI am not persuaded that the women are substantially burdened simply because men have a \ngreater number of CSI shops to choose from. Unlike the situation in vocational education \nprior to July, 1991, where the women had no alternatives to clerical arts but the men could \nchoose between welding and culinary arts, in terms of CSI employment the women have \noptions (data entry and sewing), although the options are comparatively more limited than \nfor the men. \nRemembering that the Equal Protection Clause does not require identical programs, since \nwomen have options regarding CSI, the 1409*1409 question is not so much numbers but the \nquality of the options. Glover IV, 721 F.Supp. at 837 (refusing to judge parity regarding \nvocational programming on \"a `body count' of programs,\" but finding the quality was \ninferior). The evidence was sketchy at best as to whether the CSI jobs at NSP were better \nin terms of quality compared to the CSI jobs at NCW.[54] In fact, plaintiffs spend virtually no \ntime in their posttrial briefs telling me why, aside from counting jobs, the female inmates are \nsubstantially burdened in this area. Accordingly, I find and conclude that the women were \nnot substantially burdened by the number of CSI employment options or the quality of CSI \njobs at NCW as compared with NSP. \nI turn next to the preemployment aspect of CSI's presence at both prisons. It is clear that all \ninmates who work for CSI at either NSP or NCW receive some preemployment training. The \nplaintiffs argue that the preemployment aspect of the CSI operation, in essence, provides \nvocational education and that, comparatively, the females are substantially burdened by the \ndifferences in treatment. \nThe preemployment training at NSP is provided through SECC, and it is extensive and \ncomparatively sophisticated. (Exs. 264-274; 927-933.) The training is made up of five core \ncourses (orientation, mathematics, measurements, the \"worker,\" and safety) followed by \nspecific vocational courses (blueprint reading/drawing; wood furniture (power equipment); \n\nmetal furniture (including welding) and sewing). It takes about two weeks to complete this \ntraining. \nSECC described what it did for preemployment training this way: \nSOUTHEAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE \nCORRECTIONS DIVISION \nCORRECTIONAL INDUSTRIES PREEMPLOYMENT TRAINING \nMAY 22, 1990 \nUpon assignment as a STUDENT, individuals are registered on a registration form that \nspecifies that they are enrolling in a non-credit course of training. There are nine courses or \nbooklets offered to the enrollee: \n1. ORIENTATION \n2. MATHEMATICS \n3. MEASUREMENTS \n4. THE WORKER \n5. SAFETY \n6. BLUE PRINT READING/DRAWING \n7. WOOD FURNITURE (Power equipment) \n8. METAL FURNITURE (including Welding) \n9. SEWING (Jade/Lapen) \nThe first five basic core booklets are manditory [sic] for all students. One must take these \ncourses, in order to receive a certificate of completion. Enrollees are interviewed as to their \ndesire and purpose for joining the program ... what their expectations are, what goal they \nwant to achieve. \nThe new student is then given a brief oral history of Correctional Industries, summarizing \n[sic] highlightes [sic] and events that have taken place over the years. The changes that \nhave taken place in manufacturing, management, warehousing, and marketing. Class and \nshop routines are discussed ... times of arrival and departure; the signing in and out \nproceedure [sic]; location of class room toolroom [sic]; toilet faculity [sic]; smoking area; \ndrinking water; fire exits; along with areas off limits. \nStudents are assigned a SERIES # 1 Note Book containing: ORIENTATION, \nMATHEMATICS, MEASUREMENTS, and THE WORKING MAN plus SAFETY. The course \nis presented as an open entry open exit plan of study enabling each 1410*1410 person to \nproceed at his own pace. The introduction portion of the Orientation is in fact a reading test \nwhich can be taken either immediately after reading the introduction only or after reading \nthe complete booklet. \nAfter a student has taken SERIES # 1 and is interested in further study he is given SERIES \n# 2 which covers the balanced [sic] of core booklets i.e., \nBLUE PRINT READING \nWOOD FURNITURE \nMETAL FURNITURE \nSEWING \nIn conjunction with the core booklets the student is provided with various film strips and \nviedo's [sic] covering various aspects of proper tool use and safety. Plus, the program \nprovides the student with the exposure and access to various books for further reading and \nresearch if the student so desires. \n\n(Ex. 264.) \nFor NCW, there are two time periods that must be considered regarding preemployment \ntraining and the sewing factory — before and after July, 1991. Prior to July, 1991, there was \nno preemployment training of any formal nature. While there was a suggestion that the \nwomen who worked at the sewing factory received some sort of \"on-the-job\" training, it is \nclear that until the program was formalized, the women received substantially less training, \nparticularly in the five \"core\" areas, than the men at NSP received. \nAfter the summer of 1991, an administrative assistant for NCW was assigned to conduct the \ntraining, and NCW formally adopted a preemployment training program for the sewing \nfactory which utilized most of the same manuals as were used for the men at NSP. The \ntraining program at NCW is individualized with the NCW inmate working through the training \nmanuals obtained from NSP. A practical test on sewing is given after the manuals are \ncompleted. It is noteworthy that NSP has adopted the practical test on sewing for use in its \npreemployment course of study for sewing. \nI conclude that prior to July, 1991, the inmates at NCW who took jobs in the CSI sewing \nfactory were substantially burdened since they did not receive preemployment training of \nthe quality the men received at NSP. I conclude that after July, 1991, the women were not \nsubstantially burdened since they received preemployment training similar in quality to that \nreceived by the men. \nInsofar as preemployment training regarding the CSI data-entry program is concerned, it is \nlimited to typing instruction given by the business education department. As recounted by \nMs. Axdahl, the program is for those who cannot type, and the purpose of the program is to \nestablish basic typing skills: \nQ. And would you describe for us how that training for data entry occurs through the \nbusiness education department? \nA. Yes. When students, when inmates go [sic] are interested in data entry, they speak with \nMrs. Mary Mast and Mrs. Mast if she is interested in having that person and the person \ndoesn't possess adequate typing skills, can recommend that they go and participate in a \nmonth long program and sometimes the program is extended, but it's generally just a month \nto develop some basic typing skills in the business education department. \n(3085:19-3086:3.) \nRegarding preemployment training for the data-entry program, I conclude that the females \nat NCW are substantially burdened in that they receive no formalized preemployment \ntraining of any kind unless they need to know how to type. In any event, the females receive \nno training in the five \"core\" areas stressed in the preemployment training at NSP. The \nvalue of the \"core\" training for the females can be seen by the adoption of such training for \nthe females at the sewing factory. \nThe defendants argue that preemployment training is job-specific and therefore cannot be \ncompared between institutions, let alone between jobs. While defendants may be correct to \na degree, the factor common to all preemployment training through CSI is a series of five \n\n\"core\" courses that serve a distinct educational function which is not job 1411*1411 specific. \nIndeed, at NSP, CSI treats preemployment training in a \"generic\" way, regardless of the job \nsought, until the five core areas of study are completed. In this regard, I agree with the \nNCW inmates that the preemployment training given by CSI at NSP may properly be \nconsidered educational in nature. Note, for example, that CSI describes the prospective \nemployee not as an inmate or employee but as a \"student.\" The \"student\" receives \ninstruction in five core areas that are clearly educational in nature, and the \"core\" instruction \nculminates in a reading test. \n(4) \nIn summary, in the vocational area I find and conclude as follows: \n1. Before July 1, 1991, the females at NCW who were enrolled in the clerical arts program \nwere not substantially burdened because the program lacked sufficient computer capacity \nsince the goal of the program was modest (to provide entry-level skills) and, in this regard, \nthe vocational programs at NSP were of comparable quality (if not taken for a degree). \n2. Before July 1, 1991, the females at NCW were substantially burdened because they \nlacked the range of options that were made available to the men in vocational education in \nthat the women had only one course to choose from (clerical arts), and they could not \nreceive college credit or a degree for pursuing such a program. Whereas, the men had two \ncourses to choose from (culinary arts and welding) which could be taken for college credit, \nand a degree could be received for pursuing such a course of study. \n3. After July 1, 1991, since NCW maintained at least one vocational education program, and \nNSP none, the females were not substantially burdened for vocational education purposes. \n4. The women at NCW were not substantially burdened by the number of CSI employment \noptions or the quality of CSI jobs at NCW as compared with NSP inasmuch as the women \nhad options, albeit fewer in number than the men, and the jobs appeared to be of \ncomparable quality. \n5. Prior to July, 1991, the inmates at NCW who took jobs in the CSI sewing factory were \nsubstantially burdened since they did not receive preemployment training of the quality the \nmen received at NSP, but after July, 1991, the women were not substantially burdened \nsince they received preemployment training similar in quality to that received by the men. \n6. Regarding preemployment training for the data-entry program, the females at NCW are \nsubstantially burdened in that they receive no formalized preemployment training of any \nkind unless they need to know how to type, and, in any event, the preemployment training is \nnot of similar quality to that received by the men. \n(c) Prerelease \nThe female inmates challenge the so-called prerelease policy at NCW, claiming that as \ncompared to the program at NSP the program was either not offered at NCW, or if offered, \nwas deficient. Prerelease programs are programs designed to prepare an inmate for reentry \ninto society, and are considered by DCS to be academic and vocational in nature. (Exs. 183 \nand 1299.)[55] \n\nI turn first to the NSP prerelease program. Since Mike Smith, an SECC instructor, began \ndirecting the program in September, 1988, the prerelease program at NSP has involved 32 \nor 33 different study units. The study units consist of broad areas regarding general health \nand nutrition, mental health, transition to community, community resources, employment, \nand family transition. The prerelease program is not mandatory, but it is given to inmates \nwho wish to take the course. It is taught in a classroom by an instructor 4 days a week for \n2½ hours, with Friday used as a make-up day. The class is 5 weeks long, and is offered \nevery 45 1412*1412 days or so. An inmate becomes eligible when he has received a parole \neligibility or tentative release date which is six months to a year in the future. Mr. Smith \nbelieves the program reduces recidivism rates. For example, in one year the recidivism rate \nfor those who completed the program was 10%, while the general rate was 23%. \nWhen it is offered, the prerelease program at NCW consists of a six-week course of study \nwhich includes units on life on the street, job-seeking skills, the parole and pardon process, \nplanned parenthood (if not done by the medical department), community corrections (work \nrelease), money management (if the inmate has not taken the programs through MOLD), \nand self-esteem. The program was offered five times in 1988, twice in 1989, and then not \nagain for more than a year. The program was offered once more in June, 1990, January, \n1991, and October, 1991. As of the date of trial in July, 1992, the program had not been \noffered since October, 1991. Although the superintendent of NCW thought the program was \nimportant, Ms. Axdahl, the person who was responsible for the program, had so many other \nduties — education coordinator, recreation director (at times), law librarian (at times) and \nresource person for orientation — that she simply did not have time to offer the program on \na regularly scheduled basis. \nI do not believe the inmates at NCW have been substantially burdened by any qualitative \ndifferences in the prerelease programs as between NCW and NSP. While the programs are \ndifferent at the two institutions, from a qualitative standpoint I believe the program at NCW \nis sufficiently designed such that it is comparable to the NSP program. Indeed, Mike Smith \ntestified that some of the course work for the NSP program had been derived from the NCW \nprogram. \nOn the other hand, I think it clear that the NCW program has not been offered on a regularly \nscheduled basis since 1988. Accordingly, the NCW women have not known when the \ncourse would be offered, and for fairly large blocks of time — in some cases for more than a \nyear — the prerelease program was simply not made available to the inmates at NCW. \nThus, I find and conclude that the women at NCW have been substantially burdened since \nJanuary 1, 1989, by the failure of NCW to provide regularly scheduled prerelease programs \nto its inmates given the fact that NSP inmates were provided with regularly scheduled \nprerelease programs. \nThe defendants argue that the prerelease program at NCW must be viewed in light of the \nother programs at NCW such as the MOLD program. In other words, the defendants, in \nessence, argue that because of other programs at NCW the failure to provide regularly \nscheduled prerelease programming did not harm the NCW inmates. I am not persuaded. \nThe Department of Corrections, and indeed the staff at NCW, viewed prerelease programs, \nas such, as important for male and female inmates. The truth of the matter, according to the \n\nNCW superintendent, is that the prerelease program, as a separate program, \"was very \nimportant.\" (3786:914) (emphasis added).) \n2. Important State Objective \nHaving determined that females suffered a substantial burden as a result of the defendants' \neducational and vocational policies, I must now determine whether there are important \ngovernmental objectives which are said to warrant the challenged policies. Once again, the \ndefendants do not clearly articulate the important state objectives which justify the policies \nat issue. Accordingly, I conclude that the important state objective upon which the \neducational and vocational policies are founded is the objective of remediation and there \nexists no other asserted objective.[56] \n3. Relationship Between Objective and Means \nHaving previously determined that an important governmental objective exists in providing \nremedial services to women at NCW, the question becomes whether the \nmeans 1413*1413 chosen to further that objective are directly and substantially related. In \nthis instance, the \"means\" chosen are the academic and vocational policies found to have \nsubstantially burdened the female inmates at NCW. \nAs noted earlier, the Pitts court recognized that where the challenged policy \"directly \nresponds to and entirely correlates with the more pervasive gender classification existing in \nboth federal and state prison systems,\" the challenged policy may be upheld, unless the \nrecord shows the challenged policy to be the product of traditional stereotyping or archaic \nnotions of \"appropriate\" gender roles. 866 F.2d at 1459. Once again, the challenged \nacademic and vocational policies previously found to have substantially burdened the \nfemale inmates fail the Pitts test on both counts. \nFirst, and by way of example, denying women the opportunity to take on-site college \nclasses when their male counterparts have such opportunities cannot be said to \"directly \nrespond\" and \"correlate\" to the \"pervasive\" policy of segregation of women from men in \nprison. There is nothing about the need to segregate men from women in prison that \nrequires the state to provide unequal educational or vocational opportunities to women. \nSecond, to the extent the unequal academic and vocational policies are postulated upon the \nnotion that the \"special needs\" of women require the difference in treatment, I am satisfied \nthat such a notion is an afterthought, predicated, in any event, upon a stereotypical \nassumption about women. The defendants largely argue that the differences in treatment \nbetween the male and female inmates are products of the exercise of discretion of prison \nadministrators. In essence, the defendants argue that so long as female inmates were \nprovided some type of programming, the court should not interfere with the prison \nadministrators' exercise of discretion as to which programs should be offered inasmuch as \nwomen have special needs. \nFor example, in regard to vocational services the defendants argue: \"As long as prison \nadministrators provide vocational programming across the board, courts should not interfere \n\nwith prison administrators' discretion in determining the types of vocational program[s] to be \noffered at each institution.\" (Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 35.) The defendants seem to argue, \nalbeit implicitly, that the programming decisions for the women as compared to the men \nwere based upon \"different needs ... within the two institutions.\" (Id. at 24.) \nThere are two difficulties with this argument. To begin with, there is virtually no evidence to \nsuggest that the programming offered the women was the product of the exercise of \ndiscretion. What struck me over and over again was that female inmates were treated \ndifferently simply because it was assumed that the females required different treatment. \nVery little, if any, thought was given by the defendants as to whether women truly required \ndifferent academic or vocational policies compared to the men. While the defendants now \npoint to the differences in the inmate \"profiles,\" there is scarce evidence that these profiles \never motivated the defendants when making programming decisions. \nStill further, the fact that women may have \"special needs\" does not warrant the conclusion \nthat women have lesser academic or vocational needs. The defendants make much of the \nfact that the women are provided with programs designed to assist them in raising their \nchildren — the so-called \"MOLD\" and \"Living Skills\" programs — and seem to suggest that \nas a result of such programs the relative inequality of the academic and vocational policies \nshould be overlooked. The short answer to this argument is that the needs of the women in \nthe academic and vocational areas are simply not addressed by programs such as \"MOLD\" \nor \"Living Skills.\" \nAs noted earlier, it could scarcely be contended, for example, that programs designed to \nassist men in dealing with aggression are academic or vocational in nature, although surely \ncontrol of aggression may be a necessary ingredient for academic or vocational success. \nThe same is true of the \"MOLD\" or \"Living Skills\" programs offered to the women. \nTherefore, one cannot substitute one 1414*1414 program, such as MOLD, for another \nprogram, such as postsecondary education, on the theory that the former addresses the \nneed for the latter. \nMoreover, to the extent the defendants argue that NCW was required to stress basic \neducation due to the special needs of women compared to men, such an argument, as \npreviously indicated, is not factually supported in absolute or relative terms. For example, \nany comparison between the males at NSP and the females at NCW is premised upon a \nsignificant amount of \"missing data\" for the men; female inmates at NCW tended on \naverage to score better than the adult national average for reading; and about 25% of the \nwomen could do college work. Indeed, at OCC, where in 1989 levels of educational \nachievement were admittedly similar to those at NCW, the State of Nebraska offered on-site \ncollege courses, thereby suggesting that it is feasible to do for NCW inmates what was \nbeing done for inmates at NSP. \nThus, much of the defendants' argument is based upon views of the nature of women which \nare irrelevant (just because women need programs such as MOLD does not mean they do \nnot need equal academic or vocational programs) or inaccurate (women compared to men \nin either absolute or relative terms are as capable academically). Because the challenged \npolicies are built upon notions about women that are irrelevant and inaccurate, it is fair to \n\ninfer that there is no direct and substantial relationship between the means chosen and the \nobjective sought. \nIn summary, I find and conclude that the challenged academic[57] and vocational[58] policies \npreviously determined to have substantially burdened the female inmates are not directly \nand substantially related to an important governmental objective. As to these policies, the \nNCW inmates have therefore proven a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \nE. Law Library \n1. Burden \nThe NCW inmates claim they are substantially burdened as compared to the men at NSP \nby the following policies concerning the law library:[59] (a) law library restrictions on \nsegregation inmates; (b) law library restrictions on orientation inmates; (c) the hours the law \nlibrary is available to general population inmates; and (d) the contents of the law library. I \nshall address each complaint in turn. \n(a) Segregation \nThe evidence establishes that prior to and until November, 1989, the women inmates at \nNCW who were segregated[60] from the general population had no physical access to the \nlaw library, and they had to submit requests for materials to Ms. Axdahl, who in turn would \nhave other inmates, who were generally untrained, gather the materials. It is not clear what \ntype of access males at NSP were provided during this period of time, but it appears to \nhave been similar to that provided 1415*1415 the females. See Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 \nF.Supp. 1121, 1127-32 (D.Neb.1988) (finding similar restrictions on males). While the \nfemale inmates may have proven a violation of their right of access to the courts, they have \nnot proven that they were substantially burdened by the difference in treatment for equal \nprotection purposes. \n(b) Orientation \nThe orientation[61] inmates appear to have been restricted in the same manner as the \nsegregation inmates until November, 1989; that is, they had no physical access to the law \nlibrary and they had to submit requests for materials to Ms. Axdahl, who in turn would have \nother inmates, who were generally untrained, gather the materials. But the evidence is \nvague about precisely how the NSP inmates in orientation were treated during this time \nframe. Accordingly, I conclude that the NCW female inmates have not proven they were \nsubstantially burdened for equal protection purposes, although they may have established a \nviolation of their right of access to the courts. \n(c) Library Hours and Contents \n\nSince the challenges to the library hours and the contents of the library by the general \npopulation inmates are similar, I shall consider the challenges together. \nI reiterate that simply because the law libraries at the male and female institutions are \ndifferent in size or are operated differently does not mean that the women are substantially \nburdened for equal protection purposes. Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1096 (\"I do not believe \nthat because [the male prison] has a much larger library that Plaintiffs can fairly claim that \nthe State discriminates against them.\"). On the other hand, simply because the state \nprovides an otherwise constitutionally acceptable law library under Bounds for use by \nwomen does not mean that women are treated appropriately for equal protection \npurposes. Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. at 739-740. The relevant question, of course, is \nwhether the differences are significant enough that it may be said that women are \nsubstantially burdened for equal protection purposes. \nI have concluded that throughout the relevant time frame the women inmates have been \nsubstantially burdened with reference to issues concerning the law library. \n(1) \nPrior to November, 1989, the NCW law library was housed in a very small room. For \nexample, in order to do legal research one apparently had to \"stand in the aisle,\" (2717:6), \nbecause the only table was a small typewriter stand. The legal materials were not organized \nbut \"just were kind of piled all over.\" (2717:8-10.) After November, 1989, the law library was \nmoved to better quarters. The male inmates at NSP always had adequate quarters for a law \nlibrary. \nFor a substantial period of time, the law library at NCW did not contain the important tools \nfor basic legal research. Until \"either late in 1989 or early 1990,\" (1872:21), the NCW law \nlibrary did not contain a \"Shepard's\" citator[62] for Nebraska cases. It appears that the library \ndid not contain a \"Shepard's\" citator for federal cases until October, 1990. (Ex. 830.) During \nthis period of time, the only way to check the history of a case was to send a request \nthrough the mails to have it \"Shepardized\" by an inmate legal aide at NSP.[63] The request \nfirst had to go through a staff person at NCW and then to a staff person at NSP, who finally \nrouted the request to an inmate aide at NSP. \nDuring this period of time, as a practical matter, the female inmates had no timely method to \ndo basic research. Without a 1416*1416 method like Shepard's Citations for checking the \nhistory of a case, legal research of any quality was very difficult. Indeed, as of November 5, \n1991, the DCS library coordinator required that each Nebraska penal institution subscribe to \nShepard's Federal Citations, U.S. Citations, and Nebraska Citations. (Ex. 1115.) The \ninmates at NSP, in contrast, always had adequate research materials. \nFinally, throughout the relevant time frame, and at present, the women at NCW have had \nsignificantly less time to use the law library than the men at NSP. In fact, the women had \nonly about a third of the time which was available to the men. The general population \nwomen have been limited to using the law library as follows: one hour per day between 4:00 \np.m. and 5:00 p.m., Sunday through Saturday, and every other day from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 \np.m. Thus, the women have no more than 2 hours of scheduled law library time available to \n\nthem each day, and about half the time the females have only one hour per day of \nscheduled law library time. \nOn the other hand, the general population men at NSP have the opportunity to study at the \nlaw library as follows: more than 5 hours per day between 11:45 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., 1:00 \np.m. to 3:00 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 6 hours per day \nSaturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to noon, 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. to \n7:30 p.m. Thus, the men have a much greater opportunity to study during scheduled time at \nthe law library when compared to the women. \nAre these differences in scheduled hours significant? I believe they are. The NSP schedule \nprovides a great deal more flexibility during each day for an inmate to pursue his legal \nresearch. He can do legal research in the morning, afternoon, and early evening, seven \ndays a week. He can also count on at least two hours of uninterrupted time per day, seven \ndays a week, and perhaps as much as six hours per day. These factors make it much \neasier for the men to do legal research compared to the women. \n(2) \nThe defendants' response to these points is not clear, but basically it seems to be that the \nlaw library at NCW now meets the due process requirements of Bounds.[64] Even if true, \nsuch an assertion is simply not responsive to the equal protection challenge of the NCW \ninmates. \nThe defendants argue that the lack of Shepard's Citations did not burden the women \nbecause the women could get the material from the law library at NSP. I am not persuaded \nby this argument. \nAs I observed earlier, the mailing procedure required an inmate to disclose her research \nneeds to NCW and NSP staff members—people she might ultimately sue. More importantly, \nit is obvious to anyone who has done legal research that the process of having to submit \nmail requests for case history makes legal research cumbersome. \nLegal precedent develops in an incremental fashion. When one case is cited by a second \ndecision, appropriate methodology requires that the second decision be read and its history \nsearched. This may in turn require the process to be repeated over and over \nagain.[65] There is virtually no efficient way to write a mail request for all the needed case \nhistories at one time. \nThat NSP men were spared the difficulty of mailing requests for case histories, but NCW \nwomen were not, compels me to conclude that the women were substantially burdened \nduring the time the NCW library lacked the appropriate citation systems. \nThe defendants further argue that the differences between NSP and NCW regarding the \ntime when the law library is open for scheduled research are insignificant \nbecause 1417*1417 the women can ask for and receive extra time to study in the law library. \nI am not persuaded by this argument. \n\nThe \"extra time\" policy is not written. In fact, it appears to be quite new and perhaps even \nan accident.[66] Therefore, it is difficult for an inmate to know of its existence or see to its \nenforcement. Of course, such an unwritten policy is ripe for arbitrary enforcement. To the \nextent the policy does exist, the inmate is required to disclose, at least in a general way, \nwhy she needs the extra time. Still further, the policy is subject to the availability of NCW \nstaff to supervise the extra time, and staff availability generally has been a significant \nproblem. \nFinally, the defendants seem to argue that the women do not need the same type of \nscheduled hours because, unlike the men, few women use the law library. I am not \npersuaded by the defendants' statistics. The evidence is clear that the NSP men use the \nlaw library extensively; the evidence is also clear that since 1988, even when the NCW law \nlibrary was located in very cramped quarters with few tools for rudimentary research, the \nNCW inmates have doubled their usage from an average of 35 visits a month to an average \nof 80 visits a month. Given the differences in size of the inmate populations, it is not \nsurprising that there are more visits per month in absolute terms at NSP than at NCW. \nNevertheless, in absolute numbers, 80 visits per month represents more than half the \ninmate population at NCW. As a consequence, I do not believe defendants' assertion that \nthe women are not burdened by the comparative lack of time in the law library. \n(d) \nIn summary, I find that neither the segregation inmates nor the orientation inmates have \nbeen substantially burdened for equal protection purposes as result of the law library \npolicies because the men were treated in a similar fashion, or the record is unclear as to \nhow the men were treated. On the other hand, I conclude that the general population \ninmates at NCW have been substantially burdened by the law library policies in the \nfollowing particulars: (a) prior to November, 1989, the law library was housed in such a \nsmall room that it precluded meaningful use of the library, in contrast to the adequate \nfacilities enjoyed by the men at NSP; (b) prior to October, 1990, the law library did not have \nrudimentary research tools (Shepard's Citations), in contrast to the adequate materials \nenjoyed by the men at NSP; and (c) during all relevant times, and continuing to the present, \nthe scheduled hours for the NCW law library were less than 1/3 of the scheduled hours \navailable to the men at NSP. \n2. Objective and Relationship Between Objective and \nMeans \nThe defendants offer no insight into what important governmental objective undergirds the \nNCW law library policy aside from the remediation objective previously identified. \nFurthermore, the historic preference for segregating women from men in prison certainly \ndoes not compel, or support, a law library policy that burdens women. Finally, the \nimplication that women do not need law library facilities similar to those provided the men at \nNSP certainly smacks of archaic notions of gender roles. The plaintiffs have proven an \nequal protection violation.[67] \n\nF. Medical and Dental \n1. Burden \nThe women at NCW challenge the medical/dental care they are provided on equal \nprotection grounds.[68] They argue that (a) the medical facilities at NCW are comparatively \ninadequate; (b) the delivery of medical care through a physician is comparatively \ninadequate; (c) the delivery of appropriate emergency medical care is comparatively \ninadequate; and (d) the dental care provided 1418*1418 the female inmates is comparatively \ninadequate. I shall consider each challenge in turn.[69] \n(a) Facilities \nMen at NSP are fortunate to have a licensed hospital on grounds with 10 hospital rooms \nwith regular hospital beds. The hospital can, and does, hold specialty clinics in neurology, \northopedics, ophthalmology, and general surgery. The hospital is equipped with X-ray \nequipment. In contrast, the women at NCW have no similar on-grounds hospital facilities, \nalthough they have a small \"clinic\" suite. \nHowever, I do not think the lack of hospital facilities imposes a substantial burden upon the \nwomen because NCW is located very near a general hospital in York, Nebraska. The \nhospital is within 2 to 3 miles of NCW. York is a small town, and the hospital is within a very \nfew minutes of NCW by ambulance. There is no evidence that the York hospital is inferior to \nthe NSP hospital. And, there is very little evidence that NCW's reliance upon the public \nhospital results in unequal medical care for women inmates at NCW as compared to the \nmen at NSP. \n(b) Physicians \nThe NCW inmates complain that the medical care they receive is burdensome when \ncompared to the men at NSP because, unlike the NSP men, the women have no full-time \ndoctor. Specifically, the women complain that they have difficulty seeing the doctor because \nthe nurses stand in their way and the doctor is not present often enough. However, I do not \nbelieve the women are substantially burdened by any difference in the availability of a \ndoctor. \nSince 1988, a full-time doctor has been engaged to provide medical care at NSP, together \nwith another doctor who spends part of his time there. During this period of time, NSP also \nemployed at least one — and sometimes as many as two — physician's assistants.[70] NSP \ninmates are served by nurses 24 hours a day. \nThe evidence reveals that since 1988 a doctor has provided medical care at NCW one day \nper week for 4 hours, and on an asneeded basis thereafter. There is no coverage by a \nphysician's assistant. Currently at NCW, five registered nurses or licensed practical nurses \nprovide coverage between 6:45 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, \nand from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekends and holidays. Prior to September, 1990, the \n\nnursing coverage ended at 5:15 p.m. during the week, and there was no weekend \ncoverage. \nAt NCW, \"sick call\" is held each day. If an inmate wishes to be placed on sick call, she gives \nnotice of that request before 9:30 a.m. and is seen that day. A nurse holds the \"sick call\" \nand screens the inmate's problem. If the problem warrants the attention of the doctor, the \ninmate is seen by the doctor. The claimed inability to see a doctor is not peculiar to NCW; it \nalso exists at NSP due to the much greater number of inmates. A very similar routine is \nfollowed at NSP, except that sick call is held only 5 days a week, and it takes between 3 \nand 4 days to be placed on sick call, except in an emergency. \nBoth institutions use the same type of procedure for referral to a doctor. Furthermore, there \nis no convincing evidence that the lack of a full-time staff doctor at NCW, with its much \nsmaller population, results in poor care at NCW compared to the care received by the \ninmates at NSP. In this 1419*1419 connection, I was impressed by the fact that each female \ninmate receives a full medical examination upon entry into the institution, and an annual \nexamination is offered to each inmate. Also, each female inmate is seen by the doctor every \nthree months if she is taking prescription medication. I thus conclude that the inmates at \nNCW are not substantially burdened by the lack of a full-time, on-site doctor or the \nscreening methods used by the doctor at NCW. \nI recognize that the inmates at NCW gave me specific examples of what they consider to be \nthe poor care they received from the physician at NCW, ranging from the failure of the \ndoctor to treat inmate Danekas' spinal condition to the failure to treat another inmate's \nvenereal disease. The plaintiffs argue that because these women received treatment once \nthey went to their work-release assignments outside NCW, it must be inferred that the \nquality of treatment was, and is, significantly better at NSP since some NSP medical \npersonnel also serve certain work-release centers. However, I do not think such an \nargument is persuasive because the pertinent question is not what medical treatment men \nor women receive while on work release, but rather the comparative quality of the medical \ntreatment when both males and females are actually in prison. I am not willing to infer that \nbecause some women received good treatment from NSP doctors while on work release \nthe quality of care at NSP is substantially better than the care at NCW. \n(c) Emergency Medical Care \nAs to the issue of emergency medical procedures and the lack of around-the-clock medical \nservices, the evidence reveals that if a medical emergency occurs at NCW in the evening \nthere are no on-site medical personnel to assess and deal with the emergency. Rather, one \nof the nurses is contacted by telephone. \nAt NSP, there is a full-time medical staff person, such as a nurse, available at all times, day \nor night. The evening nurse is located at the NSP hospital, and while the nurse's primary \nresponsibility is at the hospital, in the event of a medical emergency the nurse is available \neither to examine the patient at the hospital or to go to the location of the injured or ill \ninmate. \n\nWhile the defendants argue that NCW does not need such coverage because of its small \ninmate population, I am persuaded that the women are substantially burdened by the lack of \ncoverage. DCS has admitted as much. In 1989, DCS noted this deficiency at NCW (as well \nas at OCC and HCC) in a budget request to the legislature, stating: \"There are no medical \npersonnel on duty during the evening or night shifts. This creates serious liability issues for \nthese institutions, and jeopardizes adequate response to medical emergencies.\" (Ex. 1305, \nat 9 (emphasis added).) \nNotwithstanding this point made to the Nebraska legislature, it was decided by the \nadministrators at NCW and DCS after the money was appropriated that additional nurses \nwould be hired to staff nursing positions during peak demand times, but not during the \nevening. OCC is apparently trying to hire nursing staff for an evening shift but has not been \nable to recruit a nurse. HCC evidently decided to elect the same nursing coverage as NCW. \nThe defendants point out that a similar situation existed at OCC and HCC — two other male \ninstitutions. While this may be true, it does not make the women any less burdened as \ncompared to the treatment the men receive at the comparable institution, NSP. Moreover, at \nNSP, LCC, and OCC, where most male inmates are incarcerated, DCS has provided, or is \nattempting to provide, 24-hour-a-day nursing coverage. Still further, there was no testimony \nabout the capability of OCC or HCC to respond quickly in the event of a medical emergency \neven without nursing coverage, while there was quite a bit of testimony about the \ncomparative situations at NSP and NCW. \nSome examples will serve to illustrate my concern. \nThe head nurse at NCW, Ms. Wehland, lives about 21 miles from NCW and another nurse, \nMs. Thomas, lives about 17 miles from NCW. In June, 1991, during a time when a nurse \nwas not on site at NCW, Kim Younger was stung by a bee. Because she was \nquite 1420*1420 allergic to bees, \"Kim started to have bad reactions,\" according to a guard. \n(Ex. 754.) One of the guards \"tried to take her vitals but she was having trouble breathing \nand ended up on the floor.\" Id. \nA lieutenant was called to attend to inmate Younger. He realized the situation was serious \nand called nurse Thomas on the telephone. Nurse Thomas instructed the lieutenant to give \nYounger a 50-milligram tablet of Benadryl, which he did. Younger had difficulty taking the \npill as her breathing was rapid. In fact, in a report later authored by the lieutenant, Younger \nwas described as having \"great difficulty breathing.\" (Ex. 751.) The lieutenant became \nconcerned about the telephone advice he had received from nurse Thomas: \"The concern \nwas that I guess I was not satisfied with what she had asked me to do with her which was \nadminister the 50 milligrams of Benadryl.\" (1109:18-21.)[71] As a result, he called nurse \nWehland. Wehland advised that Younger should be taken to the hospital, and, accordingly, \nYounger was transported to the hospital. Younger was described as being in \"bad shape\" \nby the guard who took her to the hospital. (Ex. 754.) Younger was kept overnight for \nobservation after being treated. \nI also recall the testimony of inmate Griffin. Although less dramatic than the Younger matter, \nshe testified about an incident that reveals the potential significance of the lack of 24-hour-\na-day medical staff to respond to serious medical problems. \n\nGriffin testified that she had a hernia operation after her child was born. The incision bled \nfrom time to time, requiring that it be examined and the dressing changed. Yet, without a \nnurse in the evenings, Griffin was left unattended by trained medical personnel, and her \nbleeding was apparently fairly severe: \nQ. And specifically what kinds of problems did you have? \nA. The staff members, the medical department would give me bandages to take back to the \nhall with me so that the staff could change it if it needed to be changed. \nQ. And did that happen during that week after you got back from the hospital? \nA. Yes. \nQ. After the surgery. And so it would be a staff person that change[d] [your bandage]? \nA. Yes. \n. . . . . \nQ. Ms. Griffin, did ... did any of the correctional staff at the Nebraska Center for Women \nprovide you any medical treatment after you got back from the hospital? \n. . . . . \nA. Yes. [The staff] would come in when I first started having the drainage real bad they \nwould come in and checked [sic] it then they went back out and made phone calls and they \nwould come back in and told me to make sure I went to sick call next morning then they \nwould change the bandage and look at the incision ... to make sure it wasn't ripping open or \nsomething. \nQ. During the time you were in your room after you got back from surgery, did this happen \nmore than once? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Do you know how many times it happened? \nA. [Two] maybe three [times]. \n. . . . . \nQ. Did you continue — do you continue to still have some problems with that area? \nA. Yes, I am. \n(1008:1-1009:18.) \nGriffin's medical records establish that while she may have been a chronic complainer, she \nalso had real problems with her incision which occurred in the absence of medical \npersonnel. For example, on April 30, 1990, a nurse noted in pertinent part: \"States she had \nquite a bit of oozing from incision last pm. Cleansed and dressed by [staff member] \nMoorehead last pm. Dime sized area 1421*1421 open base of incision. Intact now.\" (Ex. \n5141, Entry of 4/30/90.) On May 2, 1990, the nurse noted that Griffin brought in a washcloth \nthat appeared to be \"soaked\" in \"serosanguineous fluid.\" (Id., Entry of 5/2/90.) \nSerosanguineous fluid is a discharge of blood and serum. W. Nornette, Steadman's Medical \nDictionary at 1275 (4th Lawyers ed.). This evidently caused the nurse to send \"extra \ndressings ... to the hall.\" (Id.) Two weeks later, a doctor was required to drain the incision. \n(Id., Entry of 5/15/90.) On May 16, 1990, the dressing was changed by the nurse and \nadditional \"dressings sent to the hall.\" (Id., Entry of 5/16/90.) On May 17, 1990, the nurse \nnoted: \"Appears to have had a stitch work out of incision 1/3 of distance from top.\" \n(Id., Entry of 5/17/90.) \n\nIt appears that whether the problem is potentially life threatening, as in the case of inmate \nYounger, or merely potentially serious, as in the case of inmate Griffin, due to the lack of \ntrained on-site medical personnel, there are occasions during the evening when the NCW \ninmates are at greater risk than their fellow male inmates at NSP. Clearly, as the Younger \nincident reveals, phone consultation with a nurse who resides a significant distance from the \ninstitution is no substitute for on-site medical personnel when an emergency occurs. The \nState of Nebraska recognized this problem when DCS told the legislature in 1990 that the \nlack of such personnel at NCW \"jeopardizes adequate response to medical emergencies.\" \n(Ex. 1305, at 9.) Accordingly, the female inmates are substantially burdened by the lack of \ntrained medical personnel during the evenings as compared to their fellow inmates at NSP. \n(d) Dental Care \nThe inmates at NCW complain that while dental care is provided at NCW, it has been very \ndifficult to obtain in a timely fashion. The inmates at NCW are most concerned with the time \nframe between December, 1988, to August, 1990. \nFrom 1988 through August, 1990, a contract dentist provided dental care at NCW about 4 \nhours per week. No dental hygienist provided dental services during this period of time, so \nthe dentist was responsible for any cleaning. In the summer of 1990, the contract dentist's \nhours were increased to 8 per week. It also appears that during the summer of 1990 DCS \ndispatched additional dentists and hygienists to deal with a backlog at NCW. Although the \nprecise time is uncertain, sometime in 1992 a dental hygienist was also engaged to provide \nadditional services at NCW. \nDuring the relevant time frames, a dentist was engaged full time at NSP, and a dental \nhygienist was also engaged full time. NSP also has a dental laboratory which manufactures \ndental prostheses for all DCS institutions. \nWithout question, there was a backlog of dental work at NCW during the time frame \nbetween December, 1988, to August, 1990. This backlog was admitted, to one degree or \nanother, by the head nurse, the superintendent at NCW, and the DCS administrator who \ndealt with dental services. \nA crude statistical analysis would suggest that such a backlog was the inevitable result of \nthe lack of sufficient dental health personnel at NCW when compared with NSP. In 1988, \nthe average monthly inmate population at NCW was about 90 inmates and the average \nmonthly inmate population at NSP was roughly 650 inmates. The NCW dentist spent only \nabout 4 hours per week at the institution and he/she had no help from a dental assistant, \nwhereas at NSP, a full-time dentist and a full-time dental assistant were available each \nweek. Thus, even before the increase in the inmate population at NCW, which peaked in \n1990, the ratio of inmates to available hours of dental services was much more favorable at \nNSP than at NCW. \nFor example, if one compares only the hours per week that a dentist was available to the \ninmates (and excludes the assistant at NSP), and assumes a 40-hour week for the NSP \ndentist, on a weekly basis for each hour the dentist was available at NSP roughly 16.25 \ninmates would compete for an hour of that dentist's time if all inmates needed dental care \n\n(650 inmates divided by 40 hours).[72] 1422*1422 During the same time frame, and assuming \n4 hours were expended per week by the NCW dentist, on a weekly basis for each hour the \ndentist was available roughly 22.5 inmates at NCW would compete for an hour of that \ndentist's time if all inmates needed dental care (90 divided by 4 hours). Thus, the NCW \ndentist's services were spread much more thinly among the inmate population at NCW \ncompared with the services at NSP. The figure would be even more disproportionate if one \nfactored in the availability of a dental assistant at NSP and the lack of a dental assistant at \nNCW.[73] \nSome of the backlog dealt with relatively serious dental problems. For example, the medical \nrecords and testimony indicate that inmate Williamson had to wait over a year to address a \nsignificant dental problem. She was first examined in June, 1989. (Ex. 5139(a).) The dentist \nobserved \"alot of decay.\" (Id., Entry of 6/22/89.) Later that month, the dentist told the inmate \n\"we needed to start working on her ASAP.\" (Id., Entry of 7/27/89.) The dentist began work \non the problem in August, 1989, but could not complete the work. (Id., Entry of 8/10/89.) \nThe dentist noted at that time that the patient \"will be rescheduled ... she has a lot of decay \npresent.\" (Id.) The dental records indicate that Williamson was not seen by the dentist again \nuntil July, 1990, almost a year later. (Id., Entry of 7/12/90.) \nThe defendants do not deny that there was a backlog. Rather, they argue that there has \nbeen no violation of the Eighth Amendment. This argument is not responsive for purposes \nof equal protection analysis. I find that compared to the men at NSP the NCW inmates were \nburdened by a lack of timely dental care between December, 1988, to August, 1990. \n(e) \nIn summary, I find that the NCW inmates have not been substantially burdened by either the \nlack of medical facilities or lack of access to a doctor when compared to the male inmates at \nNSP. I also find that compared to their fellow inmates at NSP the NCW inmates were \nsubstantially burdened throughout the entire relevant time frame by the lack of trained \nmedical personnel during evenings and weekends. I further find that from December, 1988, \nto August, 1990, the NCW inmates were substantially burdened by the relative lack of timely \ndental care at NCW as compared to NSP. \n2. Objective and Relationship Between Objective and \nMeans \nThe defendants offer no insight into what important governmental objective substantiates \nthe NCW medical and dental policies found to have burdened the NCW inmates, aside from \nthe remediation objective previously identified. Clearly the remediation objective is not \nfurthered by such burdensome policies. Furthermore, the historic preference for segregating \nwomen from men in prison certainly does not compel, or support, medical and dental \npolicies that burden women. \nThe defendants suggest that the choice of whether or not to have on-site evening medical \nemergency coverage was the product of an exercise of discretion and imply that the court \n\nshould not second-guess the administrators' discretionary decision. While I am sensitive to \nthis point, I am not persuaded by the argument. \nInitially, it should be remembered that DCS publicly stated in a budget request to the \nlegislature that: \"This [lack of coverage] creates serious liability issues for these institutions, \nand jeopardizes adequate response to medical emergencies.\" (Ex. 1305, at 9.) I fail to see \nhow reliance upon the stated opinion of DCS could fairly be characterized as \"second-\nguessing.\" More importantly, this exercise of discretion, if it was one, suggests that the \ndefendants were willing to take risks with the NSP women that they were \nnot 1423*1423 willing to take with the NSP men (as well as the large majority of men in \ncustody under DCS control). I conclude, therefore, that the exercise-of-discretion argument \nmust be disregarded because it essentially devalues women inmates — a historic \ncharacteristic of gender discrimination. \nThe defendants further argue that the dental backlog was inadvertent and the result of a \nrapid increase in female inmates at NCW. From this point, the defendants assert that the \ndisparity was not a product of gender discrimination but an unanticipated function of growth. \nI am not persuaded by this argument because, as previously noted, prior to the increase in \nNCW's population, the inmate-to-available-dental-hour ratios greatly favored the NSP men. \nI do not believe, therefore, that the difference in treatment regarding dental services can be \nso easily explained away. \nIn summary, defendants' explanations fail to establish that the means chosen to implement \nthe important governmental objective are directly and substantially related. Accordingly, the \nplaintiffs have proven that the policies found to have substantially burdened the women \nviolate the Equal Protection Clause.[74] \nG. Mental Health \n1. Burden \nThe female inmates at NCW complain that their equal protection[75] rights were violated \nbecause: (a) compared to the inmates at NSP, there is, and was, a lack of effective \nsubstance abuse programming at NCW; (b) compared to the inmates at NSP, there is, and \nwas, a lack of effective \"straight\" treatment programming at NCW; and (c) compared to the \ninmates at NSP, there is, and was, a lack of inpatient[76] programming for NCW inmates. \n(a) Substance Abuse Treatment \nI shall leave the question of the unavailability of inpatient substance abuse treatment for \nconsideration in the portion of this memorandum which deals with inpatient treatment in \ngeneral. I thus concentrate here on the substance abuse treatment which does not require \nor warrant inpatient treatment. \nWhile Judith Danielson, the administrator of the mental health programs at NCW, was not a \ncredible witness,[77] I have concluded that the NCW women were not substantially burdened \n\nby the substance abuse programs (not requiring inpatient treatment) at NCW as compared \nto NSP. With the exception of a few months, both before August, 1988 (when the inmates \nwere under a case management system), and after August, 1988 (when the inmates were \nunder a unit management system),[78] the inmates at NCW have always had available to \nthem specific education and counseling regarding substance abuse problems from a \ncertified drug and alcohol counselor,[79] either through a staff person or through a contractor \n(NOVA). Whether given by an employee or through NOVA, the programs involved \neducation and group therapy regarding substance abuse. In May, 1989, Alcoholics \nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings were started 1424*1424 at NCW. In \nOctober, 1991, Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings were started. In April, 1992, relapse \nprevention groups were started. \nIn contrast, no treatment groups are held specifically to address substance abuse problems \nat NSP. However, NSP offers group therapy, and individual therapy as needed, to deal with \nthese and other problems. \nThe inmates at NCW point to various problems with the NCW drug abuse counseling such \nas the NOVA group voting to determine who could be in the group and the NOVA group \nbeing too full to accept all interested inmates. However, these problems, significant as they \nmight otherwise be, do not establish a burden when compared to the relative unavailability \nof specific substance abuse programming at NSP. \n(b) \"Straight\" Treatment \nSo-called \"straight\" treatment is the rendering of mental health services through testing and \ncounseling (in group or individual sessions) in other than an \"inpatient\" setting, but it does \nnot involve substance abuse treatment. I am persuaded that until August, 1990, when Deb \nFitzgerald was hired, the NCW inmates were substantially burdened when compared to the \nmen at NSP by the comparative lack of \"straight\" treatment.[80] After August, 1990, I am \nsatisfied that the inmates at NCW were not substantially burdened by a relative lack of \n\"straight\" treatment as compared to NSP, and plaintiffs do not seriously contend \notherwise.[81] \nJudith Danielson, an unlicensed psychologist,[82] was virtually the only person who provided \n\"straight\" treatment to NCW inmates with mental health problems until August, 1990, with \nthe exception of a contract psychiatrist one morning every other week: \nQ. Between January of 1988 and August of 1990, were you the only person providing \nmental health services to inmates at the Nebraska Center for Women? \nA. Yes. \n(2183:22-25.) \nNot only was Danielson in charge of mental health, but she was also in charge of inmate \norientation and classification as they came into the institution. Theoretically, Danielson was \nalso to provide group counseling and individual counseling sessions. \n\nIn contrast, at NSP it appears that the males could and did receive mental health counseling \nfrom a psychologist and four mental health counselors, as well as from at least one contract \npsychiatrist. This counseling was provided through group therapy sessions, with individual \ncounseling provided when necessary. \nWhile both NSP and NCW offered group counseling and individual counseling, it is clear \nthat from January, 1988, until August, 1990, the women were comparatively and \nsubstantially disadvantaged because Danielson was apparently too busy to perform \nher 1425*1425 counseling duties. A number of inmates testified that they asked for, but did \nnot receive, mental health counseling from Danielson. Inasmuch as Danielson's record-\nkeeping practices were terrible (she essentially admitted as much on the witness stand), it is \nvirtually impossible to clarify the quantity or quality of the counseling that Danielson may \nhave provided to the NCW inmates. \nAlthough Dr. Bohn later essentially denied that she meant it, after she took over the clinical \nsupervision of Danielson and after the additional counselor had been hired at NCW, Bohn \nadvised DCS that: \nHaving recently received a mental health counselor position to augment the services of the \nonly other mental health position at NCW, the staff Psychologist there, new treatment \nservices are in the initial stages of development. Since the Psychologist has the \nresponsibility for the orientation and initial classification of all female inmates admitted to \nNCW, little on-going treatment previously occured [sic]. \n(Ex. 1321, at 5 (emphasis added).) \nIndeed, Deb Fitzgerald testified that when she came to NCW Danielson complained of \nbeing \"overwhelmed by the job duties.\" (3417:14-17.) And even the defendants' expert \ntestified that NCW \"probably needed another person.\" (Ex. 5156, 103:10-11.) \nThe defendants argue that some counseling was provided at NCW by inmate case \nmanagers prior to the switch to unit management. However, this evidence is so unclear and \nundocumented that I am not persuaded by it. \nDefendants also argue that during this period of time the average cost per inmate for mental \nhealth was greater at NCW than at NSP. I have previously expressed my view that such \nstatistics are largely meaningless, and I shall not restate these views again. \nHowever, if these statistics show anything, they show that in 1989 and 1990 per capita \nspending on males at NSP and females at NCW was roughly similar,[83] and given the lack \nof an economy of scale at NCW, the fact that Danielson was the sole provider of \"straight\" \ntreatment in addition to her orientation and classification duties, and that she was \n\"overwhelmed,\" these statistics confirm what Dr. Bohn observed: Before the additional \ncounselor was hired, \"little on-going treatment previously occurred.\" \n(c) Inpatient Treatment \n\nThe females at NCW argue that they cannot practically receive inpatient treatment for \nserious mental health and substance abuse problems while the men at NSP can receive \nsuch treatment. The facts establish this point and cause me to conclude that the females \nare thus substantially burdened. \nDuring all relevant times, and up to the present, males at NSP (and males at other \ninstitutions) could receive specialized and intensive inpatient treatment in four areas: \nsubstance abuse, sexual offenses, serious mental illness, and social or developmental \nimpairment. (Ex. 1321, at 1-3.) These programs are housed at the Lincoln Correctional \nCenter (LCC), but NSP inmates can and do receive this special treatment. After treatment \nhas been completed, they return to NSP.[84] Each program is housed in what amounts to an \n\"inpatient\" setting like a hospital. \nThese programs are apparently quite successful. For example, relative to the mental health \nprogram and the socially and developmentally impaired program, Dr. Bohn observed that \n\"[b]ecause of the intensity of treatment delivered to these inmates, many are able to make a \nnear satisfactory adjustment to prison who otherwise would require interinstitutional transfer \nto the Lincoln Regional Center (LRC) [a state run mental institution].\" (Id. at 2.) \nAt NCW, in contrast, persons with serious substance abuse, mental health, sexual, \nor 1426*1426 social/developmental problems requiring inpatient care have no similar \nopportunity for such intensive treatment. The females are either not treated on an inpatient \nbasis or they are transferred out of DCS custody to a state mental institution quite distant \nfrom NCW.[85] This, and perhaps other problems, apparently caused Dr. Bohn to observe in \n1991 that there were serious questions of \"parity\" involved: \nAt the NCW as women inmates seek parity and equality with the mental health services \noffered to male inmates, additional resources will need to be developed to address the \ngrowing needs of these women. There also is a need for increased ability to treat women \nwith major mental and behavioral disturbances as evidenced by the necessity to transfer \nwomen to the Department of Public Institutions over the past year. \n(Ex. 1321, at 7 (emphasis added).) \nThe defendants seem to argue that similar inpatient programs at NCW are not needed \nbecause inmates with \"special needs\" can be specially treated at NCW, given its much \nsmaller inmate population, and thus the women are not burdened. I do not accept this \nargument. \nThe obvious reason that the inpatient programs are needed and work is due to \"the intensity \nof treatment delivered to these inmates.\" (Ex. 1321, at 2.) Or, as Dr. Bohn stated in \nreference to the substance abuse program, the benefit of an inpatient program is \"just more \ncomplete treatment.\" (2636:20.) There is no reason to suspect that women need less \n\"intensity of treatment\" or less \"complete treatment\" than do men. In fact, the evidence is to \nthe contrary. For example, Deb Fitzgerald, the NCW counselor, testified that various NCW \nwomen have severe substance abuse problems and could benefit from inpatient treatment. \n\nNeither do I think the availability of a transfer from DCS to HRC is a comparable solution, at \nleast on the record presented to me.[86] It is clear that the inpatient programs for the men are \nspecially designed to deal with the unique personalities of criminals. There is no evidence, \nor reason to believe, that a state mental hospital can provide an NCW inmate with \nspecialized care of the kind provided to NSP males through the inpatient programs at LCC. \nThis is undoubtedly why Bohn recognized the need at NCW \"for increased ability to treat \nwomen with major mental and behavioral disturbances.\" (Ex. 1321, at 7.) \nExamples will illustrate the point. The inpatient program for male prisoners with respect to \nsubstance abuse is specifically designed to deal with the \"larger problem, that being a \ncriminal personality in which responsibility is shunned and the rights of others not \nregarded.\" (Id. at 3.) The sex offender program deals with \"victims who later become \nperpetrators.\" (Id. at 3.) The mental health and social/developmental programs endeavor to \nassist the inmate \"to make a near satisfactory adjustment to prison.\" (Id. at 2.) \nIn conclusion, the NCW inmates are substantially burdened by the failure to provide them \nwith inpatient treatment comparable to programs available to NSP men. \n(d) Summary \nIn summary, I conclude that the NCW women were not substantially burdened by the \nsubstance abuse treatment available to them at NCW (excluding inpatient treatment). I also \nconclude that the NCW women were not burdened by the \"straight\" treatment afforded them \nafter August, 1990. I further find that the NCW women were substantially burdened by the \ncomparative lack of \"straight\" treatment prior to August, 1990, and the comparative lack of \ninpatient treatment throughout all relevant time periods. \n2. Objective and Relationship Between Objective and \nMeans \nOnce again, the defendants offer no insight into what important governmental \nobjective 1427*1427 substantiates the NCW \"straight\" treatment and inpatient treatment \npolicies found to have burdened the NCW inmates aside from the remediation objective \npreviously identified. Clearly the remediation objective is not furthered by such burdensome \npolicies. Furthermore, the historic preference for segregating women from men in prison \ncertainly does not compel, or support, mental health policies that burden women. Moreover, \nthe suggestion, as implicitly made regarding inpatient treatment, that women do not need \nthe same \"intensity\" of treatment as males devalues women and is characteristic of gender \nbias. \nThe NCW inmates have therefore proven a violation of the Equal Protection Clause with \nrespect to \"straight\" treatment, prior to August, 1990, and inpatient treatment, at all relevant \ntimes.[87] \nH. Recreation \n\n1. Burden \nThe NCW inmates claim a violation of the Equal Protection Clause for the following \nreasons: (a) compared to the NSP general population, the NCW general population is \ndisadvantaged from the perspective of the general recreational opportunities afforded them; \n(b) compared to the NSP general population, the NCW general population is disadvantaged \nin the art and hobbycraft area; (c) compared to the men at NSP, the NCW orientation \ninmates are disadvantaged because they must take their recreation at the same time they \nare permitted to go to the law library and because they must take their recreation indoors, \nand (d) compared to the men at NSP, the NCW segregation inmates are disadvantaged \nbecause of their limited recreation facilities. I turn to those issues now. \n(a) General Recreational and Art and Hobbycraft \nOpportunities \nI think it best to discuss the issues of general recreational opportunities and art and \nhobbycraft opportunities together. \nI conclude that the NCW women have been and are now substantially burdened compared \nwith their fellow NSP inmates in both the general recreational area and the art and \nhobbycraft area in the following ways: (1) in the number of hours of recreational, art and \nhobbycraft opportunities available to them, particularly when no activities coordinator was \nemployed,[88] and (2) in the number and sophistication of recreational, art and hobbycraft \nactivities available to them, particularly when no activities coordinator was employed. I do \nnot believe that the women are burdened because of the size of the respective gyms or \nbecause of any other differences in the plant or equipment for recreational, art and \nhobbycraft opportunities. \n(1) \nAt NCW, women have two hours on the weekends and between 1 and 2 hours during \nweekdays in which to use the gym and related recreation room. The men have much \ngreater access to their gym. The NSP gym is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. \nto 10:15 a.m., 12:00 noon to 3:15 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. to 7:45 p.m., for a total of 8 hours and \n45 minutes. On weekends, the men can gain access to the gym from noon until 3:15 p.m. \nand from 4:30 p.m. until 7:45 p.m., for a total of 6 hours and 30 minutes. \nA similar situation exists with regard to the \"yard\" at each institution. The \"yard\" includes \nthose areas where miscellaneous recreation facilities are located (e.g., ball diamonds). The \nyard is open to the women during the time they can obtain access to the gym. The men can \ngain access to the yard from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (except for \"count\" and meal times) \nduring daylight savings time, and from 7:30 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. during standard time. \nThe situation is similar in terms of the number of hours available to pursue art \nand 1428*1428 hobbycraft leisure-time activities. The art and hobbycraft area is only open to \nwomen during the time they can obtain access to the gym. On the other hand, the men at \n\nNSP can gain access to their art and hobbycraft area Tuesday through Saturday from about \n11:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. \nAs to the number of recreational, art and hobbycraft activities, defendants \"readily admit \nthat more recreational activities are scheduled at NSP than NCW,\" although the defendants \ndo not concede the relevance of the point. (Defs.' Reply Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 35.) As a \nmatter of fact, the disparity between the two groups is clear. \nFor example, the women have no outside team competition, no hobbycraft association, and \nlittle or no structured intramural activities. The men have a \"varsity\" sports program which \nhas competitions with outside institutions in softball, baseball, basketball, volleyball, and flag \nfootball. The men have a sophisticated hobbycraft association which promotes an equally \nsophisticated artistic, woodworking, and leathercraft program. The men have structured \nintramural activities in volleyball and basketball. \nThe defendants assert, in essence, that the women at NCW are not burdened because they \nare much less idle than the male inmates, and because NCW has always been responsive \nto the recreation needs of the women. \nI have previously discussed why I am not persuaded by the \"idleness\" data and shall not \nreiterate my position. Suffice it to say that the methodology employed appeared to be \nflawed (e.g., men who worked part time and were part-time students were treated as \"idle\"), \nand the data fails to account for the large number of men who wish to be idle (perhaps as \nmany as 30%). Thus, the argument that the women are not burdened because they are less \n\"idle\" than the men is built upon faulty data. \nEqually important is the fact that even if many of the men at NSP are idle, many others are \nnot.[89] For a man who is not idle, NSP provides a much better recreational program in terms \nof the number of hours of access and range of activities compared to a woman at NCW, be \nshe busy or idle. Perhaps this is only a different way of stating that the recreational policies \nat NSP appear to take into account the large number of male inmates who are busy, and, \nthis being true, the NCW policy which fails to similarly respond to the busy female inmate is \nburdensome by comparison. Thus, the \"idleness\" argument, even assuming the validity of \nthe underlying data, does not support the defendants' position. \nI am also not persuaded by the argument that NCW has been responsive to the recreation \nneeds of the inmates. It is suggested that whenever the female inmates requested \nrecreational activities such requests have generally been met. Initially, I do not believe that \nthis assertion is factually accurate because for a substantial period of time NCW did not \nhave a recreation coordinator; thus, the institution was simply not capable of knowing what \nthe inmates wanted or needed. Moreover, even if one accepts the assertion that the women \nhave not been demanding about their recreation needs, it is fallacious to assume that the \nfemale inmates at NCW do not want or need a program comparable to the NSP men, \nparticularly when the women have never had the opportunity to take advantage of \ncomparable programs. \n(2) \n\nAs to plant and equipment, I do not believe the women are substantially burdened. Although \nthe facilities are different at each institution, there is little reason to believe the differences \ncause any serious limitation in activities. For example, NCW has a gym, a ball diamond, a \ntennis court, a sand volleyball court, a \"music\" or recreational room adjacent to the gym, \nand an art room.[90] Recreational 1429*1429 equipment includes weight-lifting equipment, a \npool table, an exercise bike, a rowing machine, air hockey machine, \"foosball\" table, bats, \nballs, and the like. The art room includes wood materials, a router, a band saw, an engraver \ngun, and other tools such as \"X-acto\" knives. \n(b) Orientation \nThe NCW inmates complain that inmates who are in orientation have access to the \nactivities area between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and that this is the time they must also \nuse the law library. Furthermore, they complain that orientation inmates do not have access \nto outdoor recreation. They complain that male inmates who go through orientation do not \nhave to choose between exercise or the law library, and the male inmates also have \noutdoor exercise opportunities. \nIt appears to me that orientation inmates at NCW may now use the law library both during \ntheir one hour of recreation and/or for additional periods of time as needed. It also appears \nto me that orientation inmates may use the indoor recreation facilities, but that outdoor \nrecreation facilities are closed to the orientation inmates to avoid unnecessary contact with \nother prisoners during orientation. Since the orientation period is fairly short (normally no \nmore than 30 days), and the NCW orientation inmates are offered some recreational \nopportunities, I do not believe that the NCW inmates are substantially burdened when \ncompared to their male counterparts, even if I assume that the male orientation inmates \nhave somewhat more liberal recreation privileges while in orientation.[91] \n(c) Segregation \nThe NCW inmates complain that the inmates in segregation have limited recreational \nfacilities.[92] From my tour of NSP, the short answer to these allegations is that the \nsegregation recreation facilities at NCW are similar to those at NSP. Both are small, fenced \noutdoor \"yards.\" To the extent that during a short period of time (January through April, \n1990) NCW segregation inmates were confined to exercise indoors (in a hallway), but the \nmales at NSP were granted outdoor exercise privileges, I do not believe such a burden was \nsubstantial. \n2. Objective and Relationship Between Objective and \nMeans \nOnce again, the defendants offer no insight into what important governmental objective \nsubstantiates the NCW recreation programs found to have burdened the NCW inmates, \naside from the remediation objective previously identified. Clearly the remediation objective \nis not furthered by such burdensome policies. Furthermore, the historic preference for \nsegregating women from men in prison certainly does not compel, or support, recreation \n\npolicies that burden women. Moreover, the suggestion, as implicitly made regarding the \n\"idleness\" data, that a \"woman's work is never done\" and therefore she does not need or \nwant similar recreation opportunities is characteristic of gender discrimination. \nThe NCW inmates have therefore proven a violation of the Equal Protection Clause at all \nrelevant times with respect to the number of hours the recreational, art and hobbycraft \nfacilities are open to them, and as to the range of recreational, art and hobbycraft activities \nafforded them.[93] Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 215. \nI. Visitation \nThe NCW inmates contend that the institution's visitation policies violate their equal \nprotection rights for the following reasons: (a) the NCW general population inmates have \nless visiting time than the NSP 1430*1430 inmates, and (b) at one time the NCW orientation \ninmates effectively had no visitation privileges while their male counterparts at NSP did \nhave visitation privileges. \n1. Burden \n(a) \nWith regard to the claim of the general population inmates at NCW, I am not persuaded that \nthey are substantially burdened by the visitation policies at NCW, although the visitation \nprivileges at NSP are different. (Compare Ex. 403 (NCW OM) with Ex. 441 (NSP OM).) \nAt NCW, women can have general visitors between 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., Thursday, \nFriday, Saturday, and holidays. For a time, these visits could not exceed 20 hours per \nmonth. NSP inmates may have up to eight hours of visitation on the weekdays, or 4 hours \non weekends. In order to reduce weekend waiting lines, the NSP visitations must occur \neither on the weekdays or on the weekends, but not on both the weekdays and weekends. \nThere was no monthly limitation on NSP visits. At both institutions special visits can be \narranged (e.g., for those visitors who have to travel long distances), although the procedure \nwas less formal at NCW than at NSP. \nThe women inmates at NCW also have so-called MOLD visits where an inmate can visit \novernight with her minor child[94] on the grounds of NCW for a period of up to five 24-hour \nblocks of time each month.[95] In other words, an inmate mother can visit with her child for 5 \ndays each month, including having the child stay overnight. The NSP men have no similar \nvisitation privileges. \nThe fact that the males at NSP can have more hours of general visitation than the females \nat NCW if they visit on the weekdays does burden the females who do not have a similar \nbenefit, but the burden is not substantial. Moreover, the slight difference between the two \ngeneral visiting schedules is the type of day-to-day operational detail in which the court \nought not involve itself. Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1464. \n\n(b) \nAs to the visitation schedule for NCW orientation inmates, the policy has changed over time. \nSometime in the late spring or early summer of 1988,[96] the orientation inmates at NCW \nhad privileges similar to the general population inmates at NCW. Since I have found that the \ngeneral population inmates at NCW are not substantially burdened by the differences \nbetween the general visitation schedules at NCW and NSP, the orientation inmates at NCW \nare not substantially burdened either. I turn then to the point in time in 1988 when the \norientation inmates at NCW were subjected to a different visitation schedule. \nUntil the policy changed in the late spring or early summer of 1988, new NCW inmates were \nconsidered to be in a \"quarantine unit.\" (Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 57.) This meant that the \ninmates were not allowed to have visitors or use the telephone while they were in \norientation.[97] Orientation normally took 30 days to complete. NSP inmates who were \nundergoing orientation were not similarly restricted. \nThe inability to have visitation, coupled with the restriction on use of the telephone, \nconstituted a substantial burden to the female orientation inmates. For example, inmate \nKlinger testified that the lack of outside contact during her orientation was particularly \ntroublesome because she did not have the ability to make arrangements for her son in \nCalifornia or her property in California prior to incarceration. Even though the time in \norientation was relatively limited (in most cases 30 days or less), the burden was \ncomparatively 1431*1431 substantial because, except for the mail, the women were \neffectively shut off from family and friends, while the men were able to maintain contact with \ntheir families and friends. \n2. Important State Objective \nAlthough it is not characterized as such, the defendants essentially assert an additional \nobjective beyond the goal of remediation which is said to support the orientation policy. The \ndefendants suggest that there is a legitimate penological purpose for keeping inmates, \nregardless of gender, quarantined during orientation so as to ease the transition from citizen \nto inmate. As defendants put it, \"orientation is a quiet time when inmates are allowed to get \nacquainted with the institution and the institution gets acquainted with them.\" (Defs.' Post-\nTrial Br. at 57.) In essence, it is suggested that prison life can be such a traumatic shock \nthat unless an inmate is free from outside distractions during orientation, successful \ntransition from a free-will citizen to an inmate is not possible. There was evidence to support \nthe validity of this penological theory. I find and conclude that the objective of easing \ntransition to prison life is an important and valid objective of the state. \n3. Relationship Between Means and Objectives \nThe \"means\" — a quarantine — is directly and substantially related to the objective — \neasing transition to prison life. In fact, if one accepts the theory that prison life can be \nextremely traumatic, a \"quarantine\" may be virtually the only way such a trauma can be \n\navoided.[98] The more difficult question is whether the quarantine policy is a cover[99] for \ndiscrimination against women inasmuch as the men did not suffer under a similar policy. \nAlthough the question is not free from doubt, I conclude that the quarantine policy was not a \npretext for discrimination and that the policy was not based upon archaic notions about \nwomen. Unlike the unequal pay issue, very soon after DCS and NCW learned that the \npolicies were different at NCW as compared to the institutions which housed men, the policy \nwas changed and women were treated in a fashion comparable to men. Thus, since the \n\"quarantine\" policy is supported by a nongender-driven penological theory, a \"quarantine\" \nmay be the only way to implement the objective, and the policy was quickly changed so that \nmen and women would be treated in a comparable fashion once notice of the disparity was \ngiven, the plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause \nresulting from the disparity in visiting privileges for orientation inmates. \nIII. Title IX \nTitle IX of the so-called Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, prohibits \nsex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal assistance: \nNo person in the United States shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nIn Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-10, the court found that Title IX applied to prisons, stating \nthat the court \"cannot judicially impose a special exception to these statutes for correctional \ninstitutions.\" See also Beehler v. Jeffes, 664 F.Supp. 931, 940 (M.D.Pa.1986) (allegation of \nintentional discrimination by female inmates stated a claim under Title IX). The defendants \ndo not contend in their posttrial briefs that Title IX is inapplicable;[100] rather, defendants \nargue that 1432*1432 no violation, particularly no intentional violation, has been established. \nIn any event, I conclude that Title IX applies to prison educational programs receiving \nfederal financial assistance. \nThe parties have stipulated that DCS \"receives federal funds to operate some educational \nprograms in the [DCS] facilities.\" (Filing 409, Pretrial Conference Order, ¶ C at 3.) In \nparticular, the evidence reveals that DCS received federal financial assistance for its \nprerelease programs under the so-called Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied \nTechnology Education Act, previously known as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education \nAct, 20 U.S.C. § 2301, et seq. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the \"Perkins Act\"). \nFor example, exhibits 81 and 81A establish that DCS applied for and received $60,000 in \nfederal[101] monies under the Perkins Act in 1989.[102] In that application, (Ex. 81A), which \nwas signed by Director Gunter, it was stated that it was DCS's \"intention to continue the \ndevelopment and implementation of a uniform Pre-Release Program for all adult facilities.\" \n(Id. (emphasis added).) The application further represented that it was the intention of DCS \nthat \"all participants receive the same information and skills regardless of the facility in \n\nwhich they reside.\" (Id. (emphasis added).) One of DCS's objectives was to maintain \n\"uniformity of the Pre-Release program activities throughout the Department's adult \nfacilities.\" (Id. (emphasis added).) \nGunter and DCS gave certain \"assurances.\" The application submitted for the Perkins Act \nfunds represented, in pertinent part, that the \"applicant ... assures ... that\" the programs \nwould be \"open to both males and females\" and that the applicant would \"comply with all \napplicable federal ... laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination.\" (Ex. 81A, at 24.) \nA violation of Title IX has been established by virtue of my earlier prerelease equal \nprotection finding.[103] As previously stated, plaintiffs have established a denial of equal \nprotection of the laws from January 1, 1989, to the present by virtue of the failure of NCW to \noffer regularly scheduled prerelease programs to its inmates[104] when NSP inmates were \nprovided with such regularly scheduled prerelease programs. Accordingly, I find and \nconclude that plaintiffs have proven a violation of Title IX, by virtue of my previous finding \nrelative to the prerelease program, from at least January 1, 1989, to at least July 1, \n1991.[105] \n1433*1433 Defendants primarily argue that they should have no liability because the plaintiffs \nhave failed to prove intentional discrimination.[106] I am not persuaded by this argument. \nSetting aside for a moment the question of whether intentional discrimination is required in \norder to recover damages under Title IX, it is important to understand that there is a \ndifference between a cause of action and remedies for that cause of action. As the \nSupreme Court recently stated in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, ___ U.S. ___, \n___, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 1034, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992), \"`the question whether a litigant has a \n`cause of action' is analytically distinct and prior to the question of what relief, if any, a \nlitigant may be entitled to receive.'\" (quoting Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 239, 99 S.Ct. \n2264, 2274, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979)). Defendants cite no convincing authority for the \nproposition that intentional discrimination is an element of a cause of action under Title IX \nwhere the classification at issue is explicitly based upon gender. \nIn Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15, the court rejected the argument that intentional \ndiscrimination was required before a violation of Title IX was established when the \nchallenged classification is explicitly based upon gender. The court's reasoning in Canterino \nIII was that because the policy of classification in Kentucky was explicitly based upon \ngender (as it is in Nebraska) — that is, women were assigned to a particular prison because \nthey were women — intentional discrimination need not be shown to prove a cause of \naction under Title IX (or under the Equal Protection Clause). The court contrasted the \nsituation in Canterino III with situations where the classification was facially neutral, but \napplied in a discriminatory fashion. The court, citing Hogan, 458 U.S. at 718, 102 S.Ct. at \n3333, stated that: \"The Supreme Court does not require such an inquiry in the context of \nsex discrimination in cases attacking explicit gender-based classifications.\" Canterino \nIII, 564 F.Supp. at 714.[107] I believe the reasoning of the Canterino III court is sound.[108] \nPlaintiffs and defendants agree it is likely that intentional discrimination must be shown \nunder Title IX in order to recover damages. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, ___ \nU.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1035 (interpreting Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New \n\nYork City, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983) and stating that \"a clear \nmajority expressed the view that damages were available under Title VI[109] in an action \nseeking remedies for an intentional violation\"). If intentional discrimination is required in \norder to recover damages under Title IX, I find and conclude that plaintiffs have shown \nintentional discrimination.[110] \nIntentional discrimination can be shown in a number of ways. See, e.g., Village of Arlington \nHeights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-68, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563-65, 50 \nL.Ed.2d 450 (1977). \"Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole \ntouchstone of invidious ... discrimination.\" Id. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563. Discriminatory \npurpose is central to the inquiry, but the challenged action need not be motivated solely or \neven primarily by a discriminatory purpose. Id. \nIn this case, as demonstrated earlier, there has clearly been proven a \ndisproportionate 1434*1434 impact[111] upon the NCW females resulting from the gender \nclassification regarding the prerelease program specifically, and NCW programs generally. \nMoreover, it was established earlier, applying Hogan and Pitts, that the means causing the \nsubstantial burdens are premised upon stereotypical or archaic notions of women and are \nnot directly and substantially related to legitimate governmental objectives. Finally, as \ndemonstrated later in this memorandum, I have concluded that defendants Gunter and \nClarke, directors of DCS, displayed deliberate indifference to, or tacit authorization of, the \npractices which violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. I am thus firmly convinced \nthat intentional discrimination has been shown. \nIn sum, plaintiffs have proven a violation of Title IX, by virtue of my previous finding relative \nto the prerelease program, from at least January 1, 1989, to at least July 1, 1991.[112] \nIV. Access to the Courts and Medical Claims \nIn addition to the equal protection and related Title IX claims, plaintiffs assert claims \nregarding denial of access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment and deliberate \nindifference to serious medical needs under the Eighth Amendment. I address those \nseparate claims now. \nA. Access to the Courts \nThe plaintiffs assert the following claims regarding access to the courts under the \nFourteenth Amendment: (1) lack of physical access to the law library for inmates in \nsegregation and orientation denied those inmates access to the courts, and (2) the \ninadequate law library denied inmates access to the courts.[113] \nIt is helpful to restate certain facts with regard to both of the foregoing arguments: (1) until \nNovember, 1989, inmates in segregation or orientation were denied physical access to the \nlaw library; (2) during the time segregation and orientation inmates were denied physical \naccess to the law library, but before there was an inmate legal aide, they were required to \nsubmit their research requests to Ms. Axdahl, who would in turn have other inmates, who \nwere generally untrained, gather the materials and deliver them to the requesting inmate; \n\n(3) no inmate received training as a legal aide until August, 1988; (4) no inmate was \ndesignated as a legal aide until January, 1989; (5) prior to November, 1989, the law library \nwas housed in very small quarters which required that an inmate who desired to do legal \nresearch had to \"stand in the aisle\" as there was only a typewriter stand for a desk and the \nlegal 1435*1435 materials were not organized but \"just were kind of piled all over\";[114] (6) \nuntil late 1989 or early 1990, the NCW law library collection lacked a \"Shepard's citator\" for \nNebraska cases; (7) until October, 1990, the NCW law library lacked a \"Shepard's citator\" \nfor federal cases; and (8) during the time the NCW law library lacked \"Shepard's,\" an \ninmate who desired access to the citation system was required to submit a request to an \nNCW staff person, who in turn mailed the request to an NSP staff person, who in turn \ndelivered the request to an NSP legal aide, who responded to the request by copying the \nappropriate volume of Shepard's which was delivered to NCW for the NCW inmate. \nA brief overview of the law is also helpful. In 1977, the Supreme Court held that \"the \nfundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist \ninmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with \nadequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the \nlaw.\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at 828, 97 S.Ct. at 1498 (footnote omitted). \nIn a Report and Recommendation dated January 13, 1988, United States Magistrate Judge \nDavid L. Piester held that \"the simple fact is that if the state denies a prisoner direct physical \naccess to a law library, the state must provide that prisoner, no matter what his status, with \nassistance by trained, skilled, and independent legal personnel.\" Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 \nF.Supp. 1121, 1132 (D.Neb.1988).[115] In his report and recommendation, Judge Piester \ndetermined that a male inmate who was held in segregated custody was denied his right of \naccess to the courts because the inmate had neither direct physical access to the law \nlibrary nor the assistance of a trained inmate legal aide. Judge Piester determined that \nthe Bounds doctrine was not satisfied by allowing a prisoner to use requested legal \nmaterials in his or her cell because it was unrealistic to think a prisoner could know in \nadvance what materials he or she might need to consult. Judge Urbom adopted Judge \nPiester's recommendation on June 15, 1988. Id. at 1121-22. \nI now turn to the arguments of the NCW inmates. \n1. Segregation and Orientation Inmates \nInsofar as the segregation and orientation inmates are concerned, the NCW inmates have \nclearly established a violation of their right of access to the courts until January, 1989: \"The \nsimple fact is that if the state denies a prisoner direct physical access to a law library, the \nstate must provide that prisoner, no matter what his status, with assistance by trained, \nskilled, and independent legal personnel.\" Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 F.Supp. at 1132. It was \nnot until sometime in January, 1989, that a trained inmate legal aide was appointed to assist \nNCW inmates.[116] Thus, without direct access to the law library, and without the assistance \nof a legal aide who was trained, skilled, and independent, the segregation and orientation \ninmates were denied their right of access to the courts.[117] \n1436*1436 The defendants argue that since Ms. Axdahl had received some legal research \ntraining she served to provide the inmates with access to the courts because orientation \n\nand segregation inmates could request assistance from her. I am not persuaded by this \nargument. \nMs. Axdahl was an NCW staff member whose duties were many. For example, she was \ninvolved in education, orientation and recreation at NCW at various times. As such, she \nwould likely be a frequent target of inmate suits. Moreover, she would likely be viewed by \nthe inmates as an illicit source of information for other NCW administrators regarding \nconfidential inmate legal matters involving those same staff members. As Judges Urbom \nand Piester observed in Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 F.Supp. at 1132, in order to comply \nwith Bounds, the legal aide should be not only trained, but \"independent.\" Ms. Axdahl was \nsimply not independent; therefore, her availability did not satisfy the requirements \nof Bounds. \nAfter January, 1989, since the NCW inmates did have the services of a trained inmate legal \naide, NCW seemingly provided all that Bounds required. As Judges Urbom and Piester \nhave observed: \"There is no requirement ... that the state provide both trained legal \nassistance and adequate access to law libraries ... at least so long as either method alone \nis found adequate to satisfy the meaningful assistance requirement of Bounds.\" Reutcke v. \nDahm, 707 F.Supp. at 1131 n. 21 (citations omitted). \nAn inmate legal aide was available when the law library was open to conduct interviews with \nother inmates. There was no testimony that an NCW inmate requested the assistance of the \ninmate legal aide but failed to obtain such assistance. The present inmate legal aide \ncomplained that she sometimes had to conduct interviews over a number of days due to the \nlimited hours of the law library. But, being cognizant of the fact that NCW inmates concede \nthat the law library hours comport with the requirements of Bounds, there was no convincing \nevidence that this limited interview time substantially interfered with the ability of the legal \naide to do her work. I also note that inmate Lange testified that when she was an inmate \nlegal aide she was given extra time in the law library. \nFurthermore, DCS provides a 40-hour classroom course in legal research for all inmate \nlegal aides. The course is taught by the DCS librarian.[118] A video tape by DCS attorneys on \nbasic legal research is also available. The inmate legal aide works under the supervision of \nMs. Axdahl who, as noted earlier, has received training in legal research as well.[119] \nI am satisfied that the availability of and training for the inmate legal aides was sufficient to \nallow me to conclude that the provision of a trained legal aide constituted \"meaningful \nassistance\" under Bounds. Therefore, after January, 1989, and until November, 1989, the \ninability of the orientation or segregation inmates to gain physical access to the law library \ndid not violate Bounds because the inmates had the services of a trained legal aide. \nIn summary, for the time period prior to January, 1989, plaintiffs have proven a violation of \nthe right of access to the courts because segregation and orientation inmates were \naccorded neither access to the law library nor the assistance of a trained and independent \nlegal aide. For the time period after January, 1989, the right of access to the courts was \nprovided to NCW segregation and orientation inmates because they were afforded the \nassistance of a trained and independent legal aide. \n\n 2. Adequate Law Library \n1437*1437\nThe NCW general population inmates attack the law library, contending that it is inadequate \nfor a variety of reasons.[120] Once again, I must examine two time periods. \nPrior to January, 1989, I believe the NCW general population inmates have unquestionably \nestablished that Bounds was violated. During this time frame, as noted earlier regarding the \nsegregation and orientation inmates, the general population inmates did not have the \nassistance of trained and independent legal aides. Moreover, the law library was also not \nadequate. In order to do legal research, one had to \"stand in the aisle,\" (2717:6), because \nthe only table was a small typewriter stand. The legal materials were not organized but \"just \nwere kind of piled all over.\" (2717:8-10.) \nAfter Lange was appointed in January, 1989, she organized the library, and later that year \n(sometime prior to November, 1989) she moved the collection into a larger room. After \nLange organized it, the library was usable. \nStarting in January, 1989, I believe NCW complied with Bounds because a trained inmate \nlegal aide was made available to the general population inmates. As noted earlier, the \ninmate legal aides were made available to the inmates when the law library was open. \nIndeed Lange, the first legal aide, testified that she received extra time in the law library \n\"when I was a legal aide.\" (2773:1.) The inmate legal aides receive a fairly extensive \ntraining course in legal research from the DCS librarian or, in Lange's case, from Southeast \nCommunity College.[121] The NCW inmate legal aide was supervised by Ms. Axdahl, who \nhas also received legal research training. \nLange testified that after her training in legal research, \"I could help them look up a case.\" \n(2733:23-24.) At first Lange did not know how to use legal \"forms,\" but she developed a \nfamiliarity with a \"few\" forms for filing cases \"by trial and error.\" (2734:5-6.) In fact, the \ntestimony indicated that although the results were not satisfactory to her, Lange was able to \nfile suit in a variety of situations. As the Court stated in Bounds, \"our main concern here is \n`protecting the ability of an inmate to prepare a petition or complaint.'\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at \n828 n. 17, 97 S.Ct. at 1498 n. 17 (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576, 94 S.Ct. \n2963, 2984, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). Lange and the other legal aides had the basic ability to \nassist other inmates in preparing a petition or complaint. \nThus, whatever the problems with the law library, I believe NCW provided its inmates with \nthe minimum required by Bounds when it provided the inmates with trained and \nindependent legal aides starting sometime in January, 1989. \nIn summary, the NCW inmates have established that the general population at NCW was \ndenied their right of access to the courts until January, 1989, because the law library was \ninadequate and NCW provided no assistance from a trained inmate legal aide.[122] Starting \nin January, 1989, despite 1438*1438 problems with the NCW law library, the minimum \nrequirements of Bounds were satisfied when trained and independent legal aides were \nprovided.[123] \n\nB. Medical Claims \nThe plaintiffs assert a separate claim for an alleged violation of their Eighth Amendment \nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that \ndefendants have been deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of the NCW \ninmates. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 \n(1976). The plaintiffs argue that the \"systemic inadequacies in the medical and dental care \nprovided inmates at NCW generally\" justify a finding of an Eighth Amendment violation. \n(Pls.' Post-Trial Reply Br. at 37.) I disagree. \nAs noted earlier, I believe the plaintiffs have established a violation of their equal protection \nrights in the medical and dental area regarding the failure to provide medical coverage 24 \nhours a day and because of the inability, for a time, to provide timely dental care respecting \na dental-care backlog. Otherwise, I do not believe the NCW inmates have established that \ntheir equal protection rights have been violated. Although I agree that in these two important \nareas the women have been substantially burdened by the differences in treatment they \nreceived compared to the treatment received by the NSP men, the evidence falls short of \nestablishing sufficient \"systemic inadequacies\" such that it can be concluded that the \ndefendants were indifferent to the serious medical needs of the plaintiffs for Eighth \nAmendment purposes. \nIn Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 214-15, the court was confronted with a similar Eighth \nAmendment claim alleging \"systemic deficiencies.\" The evidence presented in Canterino \nI was that: \nMedical care at KCIW is provided by a consulting physician who spends two mornings per \nweek at the institution. In addition, there is one full-time resident nurse who has two \nlicensed practical nurses under her supervision. The physician is on call when he is away \nfrom the prison. Nursing coverage is from 8:00 a.m. to midnight Monday through Friday, \nand noon to 8:00 p.m. on weekends. KCIW also receives service from the South Oldham \nEmergency Medical Squad and a group of inmates who have completed emergency \nmedical technician training. A dentist visits KCIW one afternoon per week. \nThe infirmary at KCIW has 12 beds. As previously noted, this area is serving as overflow \nhousing for the A & O unit. Office space for the doctor and nurses is located next to the \ninfirmary. Due to overcrowding in A & O, double bunking has been resorted to in the \ninfirmary. \nThe medical records kept by the physicians list medication only, with no notation of history, \nphysical exams or diagnosis. Patients requiring specialty care or hospitalization are sent to \nUniversity Hospital in Louisville. The record shows that outside referrals are made on a \nregular basis. \nId. at 199-200 (citations to the record omitted). \nThe Canterino I evidence is, in most important respects, very similar to the evidence \npresented in this case. The Canterino I court concluded that no Eighth Amendment violation \nhad been established. Id. at 215. I come to a similar conclusion in this case. \n\nHowever, unlike Canterino I, where there was \"[n]o evidence ... that any female inmate had \nbeen denied treatment for a serious medical need,\" 546 F.Supp. at 200, there was troubling \nevidence in this case of either lack of treatment or delay in treatment respecting serious \nmedical or dental problems — the so-called \"bee-sting\" incident involving inmate Younger \nwho went into shock; the postsurgery troubles of inmate Griffin who had significant bleeding \nand related problems with her surgical incision; and the incident involving inmate Williamson \nwho 1439*1439 waited about a year to receive dental care, which, according to the dentist, \nrequired treatment \"ASAP.\"[124] See Johnson v. Lockhart, 941 F.2d 705, 707 (8th \nCir.1991) (stating that abdication of policy-making and oversight responsibilities by top \nprison officials can reach the level of deliberate indifference to prisoner's medical needs, \nand holding that the district court erred when it dismissed a complaint alleging that plaintiff \ndid not receive prompt surgery even though prison made doctors and 24-hour hospital \navailable to inmates). I turn to those incidents in relationship to the Eighth Amendment \nclaims. \nFirst, I consider the actions of defendant Wehland regarding these three incidents. As to the \nbee-sting incident, the specific actions of nurse Wehland are not attacked by the plaintiffs. \nClearly, she responded as soon as she was called on the telephone, and she responded \nappropriately and in a timely fashion. She directed that inmate Younger receive immediate \ntreatment at the hospital. The same is true of the incident involving inmate Griffin. To the \nextent that Wehland participated in any treatment that Griffin received, there is no claim that \nWehland failed to provide timely and appropriate treatment. Similarly, with regard to \nWilliamson, there is no claim that Wehland failed to provide either appropriate or timely \ndental care to the extent she was personally able to render care. Thus, with regard to the \nactual treatment these three NCW inmates received, to the extent Wehland was involved in \nthe treatment there is no basis to conclude that she \"consciously refuse[d] to take steps to \ndeal with the problem.\" Manual of Model Civil Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the \nEighth Circuit § 4.04, at 61 (Sept.1992) (Committee Comments) (defining deliberate \nindifference in context of claim for denial of medical care). Absent such evidence, there is \nno basis to hold Wehland liable under the Eighth Amendment for the specific treatment she \nprovided these three inmates. \nSecond, what the plaintiffs really attack is the failure of all the defendants to take prompt \naction to remedy the lack of around-the-clock medical care and the need for additional \ndental personnel to deal with the dental backlog. As evidence of the bad motive behind \nthese failures, plaintiffs point out that a DCS staff person informed the Nebraska legislature \nthat the lack of around-the-clock nursing coverage \"jeopardizes adequate response to \nmedical emergencies.\" (Ex. 1305, at 9.) Yet, when money was appropriated to serve that \nneed, the funds were used to engage nurses at other times. \nWhile I am very troubled by this evidence, I do not believe it permits me to conclude that \nany of the defendants intended by their actions, or inaction, to punish the NCW inmates. \nThe Supreme Court recently reiterated that in all Eighth Amendment cases the evidence \nmust establish \"the requisite culpable state of mind.\" Wilson v. Seiter, ___ U.S. ___, ___, \n111 S.Ct. 2321, 2323, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). In Wilson, the Supreme Court reversed the \ndecision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals applying a \"malicious cruelty\" standard to a \nconditions-of-confinement case, holding instead that such a claim should be judged under \nthe \"deliberate indifference\" standard. Id. ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2328. \n\nIn so holding, the Court took pains to advise that \"the Eighth Amendment itself ... bans only \ncruel and unusual punishment.\" Id. ___ U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 2325 (emphasis in \noriginal). Quoting Judge Posner with approval, the Court noted that \"`The infliction of \npunishment is a deliberate act intended to chastise or deter.'\" Id. (quoting Duckworth v. \nFranzen, 780 F.2d 645, 652 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 816, 107 S.Ct. 71, 93 \nL.Ed.2d 28 (1986)). And, the Court emphasized, quoting Judge Friendly, \"`The thread \ncommon to all 1440*1440 [Eighth Amendment prison cases] is that \"punishment\" has been \ndeliberately administered for a penal or disciplinary purpose.'\" Id. (quoting Johnson v. \nGlick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1032 (2d Cir.1973), cert. denied sub nom. John v. Johnson, 414 U.S. \n1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973)). The Court then made it clear that the \n\"deliberate indifference\" standard was to be applied in prison cases involving conditions of \nconfinement as well as medical care. Id. ___ U.S. at ___-___, 111 S.Ct. at 2326-2327. \nIn this case, both the failure to provide around-the-clock medical care and the failure to \nprovide sufficient dental personnel were founded upon considerations having to do with \ncosts and the allocation of resources. The defendants provided nursing coverage \nthroughout most of the day, but not the entire day. Instead of using the money appropriated \nby the Nebraska legislature to engage nurses during the entire evening, additional nurses \nwere hired to staff NCW at peak times. The defendants provided dental care — although \nnot enough dental care — to many NCW inmates each and every week. When the dental \nbacklog was belatedly recognized, dental personnel from NSP in Lincoln were sent to assist \nthe NCW dentist. Aside from the two areas found comparatively wanting, which resulted in \nthree serious incidents, in every other respect the NCW females were provided medical and \ndental care comparable to the NSP males. Thus, while the conduct was questionable at \nbest, there is no convincing evidence that the defendants objectively or subjectively \n\"intended\" to \"punish\" the NCW inmates by any action they took or failed to take. \nTherefore, I find and conclude that, notwithstanding the three serious incidents previously \nreferred to, the defendants lacked the \"requisite culpable state of mind,\" Wilson, ___ U.S. at \n___, 111 S.Ct. at 2323, which is necessary to prove that any of the defendants were \ndeliberately indifferent to the serious medical or dental needs of the NCW inmates. This \nbeing true, and since I am also satisfied that, as in Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 214-15, there \nare no \"systemic deficiencies\" rising to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation, I find \nand conclude that plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claim should be denied. \nV. Individual Defendants \nIt is necessary to determine whether the individual defendants have any liability to the \nplaintiffs, keeping in mind that the remedy phase of this case (including the question of \ndamages) has been deferred. Two issues are presented. First, did the plaintiffs prove some \nact or failure to act on the part of the individual defendants that renders them responsible for \nthe violations heretofore found to have occurred? Second, are the individual defendants \nentitled to qualified immunity? Moreover, since the answers to these questions depend, in \npart, upon the type of violation which has been proved, I shall further refine the analysis by \nreference to the type of violation which has been established. I turn to those questions. \nA. Personal Involvement of Individual Defendants \n\nThe remaining individual defendants held supervisory positions with DCS or NCW. The \npretrial conference order, (Filing 409, Uncontroverted Facts at 2-4), provides the following \ninformation: \nFrank Gunter, who is sued solely in his individual capacity, was the director of DCS until \nFebruary 24, 1990. Harold Clarke has been the director of DCS since August 27, 1990, and \nhe is sued solely in his official capacity.[125] Victor Lofgreen was superintendent 1441*1441 of \nNCW until August 3, 1988, and is sued solely in his individual capacity. Larry Tewes was \nthe acting superintendent of NCW from August 4, 1988, to January 5, 1989, but the pretrial \nconference order is silent as to the capacity in which he became a defendant. I conclude \nthat he was sued in his individual capacity as a superintendent of NCW.[126] Larry Wayne \nhas been the superintendent of NCW since January 5, 1989, and he is sued in his individual \nand official capacity. Margrett Wehland, a nurse at NCW, is sued in her individual and \nofficial capacity. \nTitle 42 U.S.C. § 1983 imposes liability for \"conduct which `subjects, or causes to be \nsubjected' the complainant to a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and \nlaws.\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 370-71, 96 S.Ct. 598, 603-04, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). \nHowever, a defendant who is a supervisory official is not legally responsible for the \nconstitutional violations when \"there [is] no affirmative link between the occurrence of the \nvarious incidents ... and the adoption of any plan or policy by [the defendants] — express or \notherwise — showing their authorization or approval of such misconduct.\" Id. at 371, 96 \nS.Ct. at 604. \nA prison official may be held responsible under § 1983 \"if culpability is established in one of \nthree ways: personal administrative involvement, personal knowledge, or through the \nbreach of a legal duty that proximately causes the injury.\" Johnson-El v. Schoemehl, 878 \nF.2d 1043, 1049-50 (8th Cir.1989) (citations omitted) (mayor could not be held liable for \nconditions at city jail in absence of allegations regarding some specific action or particular \nform of inaction on the part of mayor). See also Ouzts v. Cummins, 825 F.2d 1276, 1277-78 \n(8th Cir.1987) (finding that complaint failed to state a claim against warden arising out of an \nalleged beating of a prisoner by corrections officers where there was no allegation of prison \npolicy of, or deliberate indifference to, corrections officers beating prisoners); 1 M. Schwartz \n& J. Kirklin, Section 1983 Litigation § 7.11 (2d ed. 1991).[127] \n1. Equal Protection/Title IX Violations — Gunter and \nClarke \nI turn first to the question of liability on the part of the directors of DCS — Gunter and \nClarke[128] — with regard to the proven violations of the Equal Protection Clause and related \nclaims under Title IX.[129] There is sufficient evidence to hold Gunter and Clarke responsible \nfor these violations, and I am convinced that I should do so. \nI do not hold Gunter and Clarke vicariously responsible. Rather, I hold them responsible for \ntheir own acts or failures to act because there is convincing evidence that these men were \non notice of the constitutional violations, and, despite having the authority to make policy to \ncounteract the violations, failed to do so. See, e.g., Santiago v. Miles, 774 F.Supp. 775, \n\n790-91 (W.D.N.Y.1991) (holding that superintendent and deputy superintendent of prison \nhad actual or constructive notice of race discrimination between white and black prisoners \nin housing, job assignments and discipline, but failed to adequately eliminate such \nviolations; therefore, they had sufficient personal involvement to be held liable). As the court \nstated in Williams v. Smith, 781 F.2d 319, 323 (2d Cir.1986): \"A supervisory [prison] official \nmay be liable because he or she created a 1442*1442 policy or custom under which \nunconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed such a policy to continue.\" See also Martin v. \nSargent, 780 F.2d 1334, 1338 (8th Cir.1985) (noting that in order to survive motion to \ndismiss in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, prisoner need not plead more than that warden was \ndirectly involved in the decision). \nThese men had both the right and the affirmative responsibility to make policy for \ninstitutions which housed male and female prisoners. (Ex. 78 (copy of the laws of the State \nof Nebraska at pertinent times).) The pertinent Nebraska statutes provide, among other \nthings, that the Director \"shall ... [e]stablish and administer policies and programs for the \noperation of the facilities in the department and for the custody, control, safety, correction, \nand rehabilitation of persons committed to the department.\" Neb. Rev.Stat. § 83-173(3) \n(Reissue 1987) (emphasis added). The director is further authorized to \"[a]ppoint and \nremove the chief executive officer of each facility and delegate appropriate powers and \nduties to him or her.\" Id. at § 83-173(4). Clearly, the director of DCS had the power and \nobligation to make policy, the power to delegate powers and duties to the chief executive \nofficer of NCW, and the power to remove the chief executive officer of NCW if that executive \nfailed in his or her duties. \n(a) \nWith these duties in mind, I turn to the facts. On January 29, 1988, at a meeting of the \nheads of all adult institutions, Victor Lofgreen, superintendent at NCW, reported that the \nfemale inmates at NCW had corresponded with an inmate legal aide at NSP.[130] Lofgreen \nadvised the staff that the women had become aware of \"differences between the institutions \nin the fact that there is not a variety of vocational training and academic education available \nat [NCW] compared to what is available at the other institutions.\" (Ex. 463, at 2.) Lofgreen \nstated it was possible that NCW might be able to \"work something out\" with Peru State \nCollege; \"however, it would not be anywhere near as comprehensive as what [SECC] \noffer[s] here [NSP and LCC] or in Omaha [OCC].\" (Id.) Lofgreen warned that \"this will \nprobably be coming in the form of a grievance and that the legal aide at [NSP] is interested \nin filing suit with the Federal District Court on behalf of the female inmates.\" (Id.) \nGunter was absent from the meeting, but Gary Grammer, assistant director, was present. \nGrammer and an administrative secretary prepared a memorandum of the meeting dated \nFebruary 10, 1988, addressed to Gunter. (Ex. 463.) It is likely that Gunter received the \nmemorandum addressed to him, although he does not recall it. \nOn or about March 8, 1988, Lofgreen received a grievance from more than half the inmates \nat NCW complaining of the lack of parity between females and males in Nebraska prisons. \n(Ex. 9.) The grievance was quite detailed. Its preamble stated: \n\nThe women whose names appear below bring this grievance based upon what we feel is \nclear cut evidence of discrimination against women by administration at NCW. We feel that \nwe are discriminated against because we are women, because the number of women \nincarcerated in Nebraska is smaller than the number of men incarcerated in Nebraska, and \nbecause the Center is located in a rural area with no access to secondary educational \nopportunities. \n(Id. at 1.) \nThe grievance raised specific parity issues in nine single-spaced pages of text, (id. at 2-10), \nincluding concerns about: (1) vocational and academic programs; (2) inmate work and \nprogram assignments; (3) inmate wages; (4) medical and dental care; (5) mental health; (6) \ngrievance procedures; (7) rehabilitation opportunities; (8) inmate dress; (9) recreation; (10) \nlaw library and assistance in use of the law library; (11) classification; (12) visitation during \norientation; and (13) miscellaneous concerns. \nLofgreen received the grievance, but instead of responding to it himself, he \nadvised 1443*1443 the inmates: \"Most of the issues addressed in this grievance concern \ncomparisons in policy and practice between institutions of [DCS]. Because the NCW staff \ndoes not have the factual information to address these questions it is recommended that \nthey be addressed to the Director of DCS.\" (Ex. 9, at 11.) \nThe inmates then submitted a so-called \"step-2\" grievance to Gunter because the \"Chief \nExecutive Officer of said facility recommends that we address the Director of [DCS] about \nthis grievance.\" (Ex. 10, at 1.) The grievance presented to Gunter was identical to that \nsubmitted to Lofgreen. \nOn March 25, 1988, a meeting of the heads of the adult institutions was held. This meeting \nis memorialized in minutes dated March 29, 1988. (Ex. 37.) Gunter was present along with \nother DCS staff and the heads of all adult institutions.[131] Those present discussed the draft \nof a letter prepared for Gunter's signature by general counsel for DCS. It was agreed that \nthe letter should be sent as Gunter's response to the grievance. (Id. at 6.) Gunter concluded \nthe meeting with the following direction and appointment: \"Director Gunter stated this \ncommittee is appointed as the Task Force to maintain consistency in operations and \nprograms within the institutions and the review of this grievance is its first task.\" (Id.)[132] \nThe letter drafted for Gunter's signature,[133] dated March 15, 1988, denied the inmates' \nessential complaints. Concessions were made in a few areas.[134] For example, the letter \nstated that the \"inmate pay policy at NCW will be revised to promote consistency among all \ninstitutions.\" (Ex. 10, Attach. at 2.) The letter indicated that orientation inmates would be \naccorded visits and telephone privileges. (Id. at 3.) The letter also indicated that inmates in \ngeneral, including NCW inmates, who wished to become inmate legal aides would receive \ntraining \"in the coming months.\" (Id. at 4.) Other very minor concessions were made, such \nas formulating consistent policies about receiving stamps or when inmates had to turn off \ntheir lights. (Id. at 5.) \nAside from whatever investigation the DCS lawyer may have made between March 8, 1988 \n(the date of the grievance), and the date the response was drafted on March 15, 1988, \n\nGunter was aware of no other investigation to determine the validity of the complaints of the \nNCW inmates. Except for a conversation with Lofgreen about the orientation visitation issue \nand some unspecified general discussions, Gunter testified that he knew of no follow-up. \nGunter testified, somewhat evasively, as follows: \nQ. Did you appoint any person, direct anybody to do an investigation of this inmate \ncomplaint other than the investigation done by the counsel and reflected in the March 15, \n1988 letter? \n[Defense counsel]: Your Honor I will object on the basis of foundation could we have a time \nperiod. \nQ. Did you at anytime? \nThe Court: You may answer. You may answer. \nA. What was it again please? \n1444*1444 Q. Did you at anytime direct anybody to follow-up on this inmate grievance other \nthan the investigation done by the department counsel that is reflected in the March 15th \nletter? \nA. No I did not because they had the ability to get assistance in [their] investigations if need \nbe. \nQ. Isn't it a fact that after the investigation done by counsel and reflected in the response \nthat there was no further investigation done at anytime into that inmate complaint? \nA. Investigation? \nQ. Yes? \nA. Not to my knowledge was there an additional investigat[ion] that was conducted — as far \nas conversations with people about it, yes that did occur. \nQ. And there was — but it would have been conversation between whom? \nA. Superintendent [Lofgreen], myself and others that were responsible for different areas of \nthe grievance and that were members of the CEO team. \nQ. Was there ever any evaluation done or study done of this inmate complaint other than \nthe investigation done by counsel? \nA. I don't know. There [could] well have been at the institution, could well have been by one \nof the assistant directors or their staff. I do not know that that did not occur — they were well \naware [of] the grievance and I can't say that it did not occur because I was not involved at \nall levels of review. \nQ. But you are not aware that it ever occurred isn't that true? \nA. As far as any investigation is concerned. \nQ. Right? \nA. I have no knowledge of further investigation. \nQ. And there were no studies or further evaluations done unless the report by Dr. Ryan is in \nthat category[135] isn't that true? \nA. I don't know. \nQ. Okay. \nQ. You certainly didn't do any personally did you? \nA. That's correct. \nQ. And you didn't do any follow-up except what you've just testified to [here] today isn't that \ntrue? \nA. Yes. \n(4615:25; 4616:1-4618:3.) \n\nThere is little or no evidence that the \"task force\" made any effort to further evaluate the \ngrievance or examine \"consistency\" issues in general. Of the promised changes, only one \n— the orientation visitation and telephone policy — was made promptly and before suit was \nfiled. The pay policy was not changed until May, 1989. The promised inmate legal aide \ntraining did not come about until August, 1988, and an inmate legal aide was not formally \nappointed at NCW until January, 1989. \nSuit was filed in this case on July 20, 1988. Attached to the Complaint were pages 2-10 of \nthe original grievance. (Filing 2, Attach.) When Gunter was notified of the suit, he referred it \nto DCS counsel, but ordered no additional investigation. \nNearly 10 months after suit was filed, 14 months after Gunter denied the NCW inmate \ngrievance, and 16 months after Lofgreen reported that NCW could not provide comparable \neducational programming to the male institutions, Gunter received the May, 1989, Ryan \nreport. (Ex. 34.) The Ryan report specifically warned Gunter that the lack of college courses \nat NCW \"ha[d] been the subject of litigation in other states,\" (id. at 38), that a Correctional \nEducation Association standard regarding education for women had been violated, (id. at \n65), that the \"vocational program for female offenders was inadequate,\" (id. at 69), that \n\"there was only one vocational program for women and this was the traditional clerical arts \nor office occupations,\" (id. at 65-66), and that the limited opportunity for women for \nvocational training \"ha[d] been addressed in court cases in other states in which inequity for \nfemale inmates has been charged.\" (Id. at 38.) \n1445*1445 Gunter met with Ryan personally, but testified: \"I can't recall what we discussed\" \nand \"I don't recall reading [the report].\" (4619:1-7.) In any event, the Ryan report did not \ncause Gunter to do anything with regard to this suit. \nClarke became director of DCS in August, 1990. He was promptly substituted as a \ndefendant, in his official capacity. \nThere is little evidence that Clarke has done much to investigate the facts surrounding the \ngrievance of the NCW inmates since his appointment.[136] Soon after Clarke was appointed \ndirector of DCS, his deposition was taken. In that deposition he acknowledged that he had \n\"definite intentions\" to become familiar with the \"equity issue.\" (4890:4-15.) Yet, the only \nspecific things he did in this regard were to obtain a listing of programs at NCW and tour \nNCW as part of his general orientation as director of DCS. There was no testimony that \nClarke did anything concrete with the information he gathered from the list or the tour in \nterms of the complaints of the NCW inmates. \nClarke evidently relied upon what Gunter had done (or failed to do): \"I know that the \ndepartment has — this occurred again prior to my becoming director, the department took a \nlook at the issues raised in the lawsuit and the grievance, and took steps to address some \nconcerns.\" (4888:25-4889:3.) As to specifics, however, \"I could not testify to that.\" \n(4889:22.) \n(b) \n\nI turn next to an effort to place the foregoing facts in an appropriate framework. In a slightly \ndifferent context, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has set forth an \nappropriate framework to review this evidence. \nIn Jane Doe A v. Special Sch. Dist., 901 F.2d 642, 645-47 (8th Cir.1990), the court was \nconfronted with a § 1983 suit against a school superintendent and others arising from the \nalleged abuse of school children by a school bus driver. In that case, the court affirmed the \ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants. The court \nset forth a four-part test. \nThe court said the individual defendants were subject to liability if they: \"(1) received notice \nof a pattern of unconstitutional acts committed by subordinates; (2) demonstrated deliberate \nindifference to or tacit authorization of the offensive acts; (3) failed to take sufficient \nremedial action; and (4) that such failure proximately caused injury to the children.\" Id. at \n645. \nJane Doe A involved a case of so-called \"supervisory liability\" where the school \nsuperintendent was not actually involved in the unlawful conduct, but was alleged to be \nliable because of the conduct of a subordinate. This case is slightly different because it \ninvolves the programming at an institution — NCW — and not, at least primarily, the \nconduct of a particular subordinate. This case is also different because the inmates \nappealed directly to Gunter for help; therefore, his actions (or inactions) are directly \nimplicated. Moreover, this case is different inasmuch as the unconstitutional behavior \nimplicated policy issues normally dealt with only by administrators such as Gunter and \nClarke. Nevertheless, the framework set out in Jane Doe A would seem to be applicable.[137] \nFirst, it is beyond question that Gunter and Clarke received notice of a pattern of \nunconstitutional behavior at NCW. Lofgreen's warning in January, 1988, that, even if \nimproved, the academic and vocational programs at NCW would not be \"anywhere near as \ncomprehensive\" as those at NSP and other male institutions surely constituted such notice. \nThe March, 1988, grievance addressed 1446*1446 specifically to Gunter, but also presented \nat a meeting attended by Clarke, was explicit and detailed notice to the director of DCS that \nthere was an institution-wide denial of equal protection taking place at NCW which \nimplicated nearly every facet of prison life. This federal lawsuit, filed in July, 1988, and \nbased on the same grievance submitted to Gunter, was further notice. Moreover, Dr. Ryan's \nMay, 1989, report served not only to notify Gunter of the inequality in vocational and \neducational programs at NCW, but also to inform him that in other jurisdictions those \ninequities had resulted in litigation. \nSecond, I believe Gunter, and later Clarke, displayed deliberate indifference to, or tacit \nauthorization of, the unconstitutional practices.[138] For example, aside from the investigation \nby DCS counsel that evidently took not much more than seven days to complete, Gunter \ncaused little or no investigation to be made of the detailed grievance that implicated virtually \nevery facet of prison life at NCW. This is particularly noteworthy in light of Lofgreen's \nwarnings about the lack of comparability of the vocational and academic programs at NCW \neven if improved. \n\nFurthermore, although the inmates at NCW were informed of a \"task force,\" Gunter's \"task \nforce\" did nothing of substance to pursue the inmates' grievance even though \"review of this \ngrievance [was] its first task.\" After creating the \"task force,\" Gunter did nothing to invigorate \nit. Still further, of the significant reforms promised, only one was implemented in a timely \nfashion. There was little, if any, follow-up by Gunter. \nIndeed, it took the filing of this lawsuit before the NCW inmates obtained the promised equal \npay and training for inmate legal aides. Even the lawsuit did not prompt Gunter to \ninvestigate further, however. \nAfter this lawsuit was filed, Gunter met personally with Dr. Ryan. Dr. Ryan's report detailed \nserious problems of \"parity\" in the academic and vocational areas at NCW. Yet Gunter \ncould not recall what was discussed at the meeting, or even that he read the report. In any \nevent, Dr. Ryan's warnings did not prompt Gunter to act regarding the complaints of the \nNCW inmates. \nWhen Clarke became director, he had \"definite intentions\" to become familiar with the \n\"equity issues,\" but did not pursue the matter to any significant degree, apparently relying \nupon Gunter instead. \nAs the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has stated: \nProof of actual knowledge of constitutional violations is not ... an absolute prerequisite for \nimposing ... liability.... [R]eckless disregard on the part of a supervisor will suffice to impose \nliability.... Thus, the issue is not whether [the defendants] had actual knowledge of the \nviolations, but whether they knew or should have known of them.... \nA single incident, or a series of isolated incidents, usually provides an insufficient basis \nupon which to assign supervisory liability. However, as the number of incidents grow[s], and \na pattern begins to emerge, a finding of tacit authorization or reckless disregard becomes \nmore plausible. \nHoward v. Adkison, 887 F.2d 134, 138 (8th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). \nThird, it is clear that Gunter and Clarke failed to take sufficient remedial measures. Indeed, \nmore than four years after the NCW 1447*1447 inmate grievance was submitted, some of the \nunconstitutional practices still exist. \nFinally, there is no question that the failure to take adequate and timely remedial measures \nwas a proximate cause (if not the only cause) of the damage and injury suffered by the \nplaintiffs, and the class represented by the plaintiffs, from and after January, 1988. \n(c) \nLittle, if any, attention is given to these issues in the posttrial briefs submitted by the \ndefendants.[139] But, from the evidence presented at trial, Gunter and Clarke apparently \ncontend that they were not indifferent because: (1) the process of adopting and reviewing \nadministration regulations and operational memoranda indicated that they strove for \n\nconsistency; (2) the fact that all DCS institutions were accredited indicated that they were \nnot indifferent to parity issues; and (3) the regular meetings of the heads of all institutions \nindicated that the directors endeavored to provide consistency of treatment. In sum, the \ndirectors apparently argue that because they put procedures in place to assure consistency \nof treatment it is wrong to conclude that they were indifferent. I am not convinced. \nAs Clarke admitted: \"No one person in [DCS] is charged with ensuring that males versus \nfemales are equally situated in every aspect.\" (4861:16-18.) Thus, although there may have \nbeen a general concern about consistency, there was no specific compliance mechanism to \nassure parity of treatment between men and women. A general concern about consistency \ndoes not equate to a concern about parity. \nIndeed, the fact that Gunter appointed a \"task force\" is highly probative evidence that the \nsystems which were in place were not effective, and the fact that the \"task force\" did nothing \nis likewise highly probative evidence that the directors were indifferent to the parity \nproblems. Furthermore, the fact that Dr. Ryan found significant disparities in the educational \nand vocational programs at NCW compared to the male institutions is likewise highly \nprobative evidence that the touted mechanisms for consistency did not work. And, the fact \nthat Gunter did little or nothing in response to the report is highly suggestive of indifference. \nMoreover, the process of reviewing the administrative regulations of DCS and operational \nmemoranda of each institution was also quite obviously not intended to address parity \nconcerns. It is one thing to assure that NCW operational memoranda are consistent with \nDCS administrative regulations, and quite another to determine whether women at NCW \nare provided with parity of treatment compared to men at NSP. Indeed, there was no \nattempt to compare an operational memorandum from one institution with that of another \ninstitution. Therefore, the \"AR/OM\" review process could not realistically be relied upon by \nthe DCS directors to identify disparities in the treatment of women. \nInsofar as accreditation is concerned, I do not understand the accreditation process to \nprovide for a specific review of parity issues in the sense of a comparative analysis of \ninstitutions to assure parity of treatment. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the \ndirectors of DCS could reasonably expect the accreditation process to inform them of \ndisparities at NCW when compared to NSP. Simply put, the accreditation evaluators made \nno such study. \nAs for the meetings of the heads of the various prisons, those meetings would not have \ninformed the directors (or anyone else) of parity issues. In fact, Clarke admitted in a \ndeposition that these meetings did not even discuss or compare programs: \nI don't think we ever discussed or compared educational programs and for that matter any \nother programs. Basically the programs are set at the DCS level that we have in the \ninstitutions and the CEO is 1448*1448 basically [to] administer the program to the extent that \nDCS policy allows them to. \n(4895:5-18.) \n\nIn summary, I find that Gunter and Clarke were sufficiently personally involved that they \nmay be held accountable for the equal protection and Title IX violations found to have \nexisted. \n2. Equal Protection/Title IX Violations — NCW Staff \nAs to the remaining defendants— Lofgreen, Tewes, Wayne and Wehland — I do not \nbelieve they can be held personally responsible for the equal protection or Title IX \nviolations. \nWehland was the \"medical director\" or \"head nurse\" at NCW and, as such, had certain \nprogramming responsibilities for medical and dental services at NCW. I do not understand \nthe plaintiffs to claim that Wehland was so personally involved in the policy-making decision \nprocess that she would have liability for the equal protection or Title IX violations. If plaintiffs \ndo make such a claim, I do not find sufficient evidence to so conclude.[140] \nThe much more difficult question is whether the superintendents of NCW had sufficient \npersonal involvement to hold them responsible for the equal protection and Title IX \nviolations. Although not free from doubt, I conclude that these men did not have sufficient \npersonal involvement to be held responsible. \nIt would seem axiomatic that before the superintendents could be held liable for the equal \nprotection and Title IX violations, they must have had the ability to make a comparison \nbetween NSP and NCW and the power to change the situation when, and if, a disparity \nbecame evident. See, e.g., Slakan v. Porter, 737 F.2d 368, 373 (4th Cir.1984) (noting that \nstate law which establishes a prison administrator's legal duties provides \"a useful guide in \ndetermining who had the responsibility and capability to end the offensive practices\") \n(emphasis added); 1 M. Schwartz & J. Kirklin, Section 1983 Litigation § 7.11 at 386 & n. 334 \n(collecting cases). \nIn denying the superintendents' motion for summary judgment, Judge Urbom identified the \nissue early on: \"I find no evidence in the record as to the authority delegated to the \nsuperintendent at NCW. Whether defendants Tewes, Lofgreen or Wayne made policy \ndecisions which resulted in the alleged constitutional violations remains a disputed issue to \nbe resolved at trial.\" (Filing 486, at 6.) \nIt is clear to me that the superintendents rightly believed that the complaints of the NCW \ninmates implicated policy and fact questions beyond their authority. For example, when the \noriginal grievance was submitted to Lofgreen, he declined to rule, and instead referred the \ngrievance to Gunter: \"Most of the issues addressed in this grievance concern comparisons \nin policy and practice between institutions of [DCS]. Because the NCW staff does not have \nthe factual information to address these questions it is recommended that they be \naddressed to the Director of DCS.\" (Ex. 9, at 11.) There were good reasons for the refusal \nof the NCW superintendent to deal with the grievance. \nFirst, the power and authority of the NCW superintendent under Nebraska law is limited. \nThe superintendent is \"responsible to the director for the custody, control and correctional \n\ntreatment of persons committed to the department.\" Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-177 (Reissue \n1987). The director, and the director alone, sets policy. Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-173(3). It is the \ndirector who \"delegate[s] appropriate powers and duties to\" the facility heads. Neb.Rev.Stat. \n§ 83-173(4). \nThe evidence strongly suggests that the superintendents did not have the delegated \nauthority to make decisions about what programs to offer; rather, these decisions were \nmade at the DCS level. The evidence also strongly indicates that the facility heads were \ninstructed not to question programming decisions. \n1449*1449 For example, Clarke, who had been a facility head at NSP prior to becoming \ndirector, testified that \"[b]asically the programs are set at the DCS level that we have in the \ninstitutions and the CEO is basically [to] administer the program to the extent that DCS \npolicy allows them to.\" (4895:5-18.) As Clarke pointedly stated, \"[W]e did not question ... \nwhy.\" (4896:2-3.) \nMoreover, when Gunter appointed the \"task force,\" he made it clear that he did not want \none person to deal with these \"consistency\" issues: \"I didn't want [one] person to be the \nperson to say you can make an exception to this policy. I wanted it to be a group ... \n[decision].\" (4537:25-4538:2.) Once Gunter essentially denied the grievance and refused to \nchange most of the existing programs at NCW, the superintendents had no authority to \neven consider \"parity\" issues. \nI find and conclude that as a general matter Gunter did not delegate to heads of facilities the \npower to select or design programs, and superintendents were not to question programming \ndecisions. Moreover, with this case specifically in mind, I also find that Gunter explicitly \nrefused to delegate to the NCW superintendents the power to select or design programs or \nto deal with \"parity\" issues. \nSecond, the superintendents were ill-suited to deal with the far-reaching policy implications \nof the NCW grievance to the extent it required a comparison between institutions housing \nmales and females. Without an appropriate fund of knowledge about institutions other than \ntheir own, the NCW superintendents would have been hard pressed to realistically assess \nand deal with the claims of the female inmates even if they had the power to do so.[141] \nDirector Clarke testified that a \"particular superintendent is not positioned to know what's \noccurring in one facility vs. [another].\" (4896:23-25.) Larry Wayne, who I found to be both \ncredible and dedicated to the welfare of the prisoners at NCW, testified that while \"I'm in a \nvery good position to determine the quality of programming as offered to the female inmates \nin the institution where I'm chief executive officer,\" (3606:19-22), he was not in a position to \nensure parity of treatment because \"I'm not intimately familiar with the operations in other \ninstitutions where male inmates are housed.\" (3606:6-7.)[142] \nI find and conclude that the NCW superintendents are not personally responsible because \nthey lacked both the power and the information necessary to remedy the equal protection \nand Title IX violations.[143] \n\n3 Access-to-the-Courts Violations \nI have found that the plaintiffs were denied their right of access to the courts in two ways. \nFirst, I found that for the time period prior to January, 1989, plaintiffs have proven a violation \nof the right of access to the courts because segregation and orientation inmates were \naccorded neither direct access to the law library nor the assistance of a trained and \nindependent legal aide. 1450*1450 Second, I found that the general population at NCW was \ndenied the right of access to the courts until January, 1989, because the law library was \ninadequate and NCW provided no assistance from a trained and independent inmate legal \naide. The question remains which, if any, of the individual defendants are responsible for \nthese violations. \nSince these violations ended sometime in January, 1989, Wayne and Clarke can have no \nliability for denial of access to the courts. Wayne did not become superintendent of NCW \nuntil January 5, 1989. Clarke did not become director of DCS until August 27, 1990, and, as \nsubsequently noted, there is no evidence that the directors of DCS were aware of or \nsanctioned the access-to-the-courts violations at NCW. \nOn the other hand, Gunter, Lofgreen and Tewes were all \"on board\" during the pertinent \ntime frame. Gunter was director until February 24, 1990; Lofgreen was superintendent of \nNCW until August 3, 1988; and Tewes was acting superintendent from August 4, 1988, until \nJanuary 5, 1989. I must, therefore, examine their conduct with regard to the access-to-the-\ncourts violations. \nInsofar as Gunter is concerned, I do not believe he had sufficient personal involvement in \nthe access-to-the-courts violations to be held liable for them independent of liability for the \nequal protection violations. There is no claim that Gunter knew about the specific violations. \nThe grievance presented to Gunter in March, 1988, was phrased in terms of parity issues. It \ncomplained that the library hours were insufficient, that there was a lack of legal assistance \n\"in preparing documents, doing research, etc.,\" and that the activities director would not \nhelp the inmates with their legal problems. (Ex. 9.) Viewed in context, these were \ncomplaints about how the women at NCW were treated compared to male inmates. The \ngrievance did not specifically complain about the inadequate law library or the restrictions \non the use of the law library by inmates in segregation or orientation. \nAs noted above, it is fair to assess the equal protection and Title IX violations against \nGunter because he was specifically charged with handling those parity issues in the March, \n1988, grievance. However, it is an entirely different thing to hold Gunter responsible for \nspecific access-to-the-courts violations taking place at a specific institution when he had no \nknowledge of the violations and played no part in adopting or implementing the law library \npolicy which in part caused the violations.[144] \nInsofar as the segregation/orientation law library policy is concerned, plaintiffs argue that \nGunter had notice. It is true that the issues presented in Reutcke v. Dahm,[145] or very \nsimilar issues, were discussed in a meeting of institutional heads on January 29, 1988. (Ex. \n463.)[146] In that meeting, Dahm (the defendant in Reutcke) stated \"they would prefer inmate \nlegal aides be trained in some fashion\" and \"[t]hey do not like the idea of taking inmates out \n\nof segregation.\" (Id. at 1.) There followed a discussion about what type of training had been \ngiven. After that discussion, it was \"agreed that it would be nice to have whatever is done \nbe consistent throughout the Department.\" (Id.) The assistant director then agreed to set up \na meeting with DCS counsel to discuss \"litigation issues/concerns relative to \npersonal 1451*1451 liabilities.\" (Id.) As indicated previously, exhibit 463 was a memorandum, \nessentially minutes of the meeting, addressed to Gunter, dated February 10, 1988. It is \nlikely that Gunter received the memorandum, although he could not remember reading it. \nWhile this memorandum may have given Gunter actual notice of Reutcke, I do not believe \nthe memorandum gave him notice that NCW was not in compliance with Reutcke. Thus, I \ndo not think the memorandum can be used to establish that Gunter had notice of \nthe Bounds violation regarding segregation/orientation inmates at NCW such that he may \nbe held liable under the second part of the four-part supervisory liability test of Jane Doe \nA, 901 F.2d at 645-47. \nI turn next to the liability of Lofgreen and Tewes regarding the access-to-the-courts \nviolations. I have previously held that insofar as the equal protection violations and Title IX \nviolations are concerned, the NCW superintendents have no liability because they lacked \nboth the power and the knowledge to deal with issues of parity. The same is not true for \nNCW superintendents regarding the access-to-the-courts violations. \nQuite apart from whether the NCW superintendents had the power or knowledge to deal \nwith \"parity\" concerns, the NCW superintendents had the power and knowledge to provide \nmeaningful access to the courts for inmates in the prison they ran. Since it was their policies \nwhich ran afoul of Bounds, the superintendents are liable. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at \n1134 (quoting Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d at 1338: \"`[a] prison warden can be held liable for \npolicy decisions which create unconstitutional conditions,'\" and holding that Warden Dahm \nwas \"ultimately responsible for the policy of the institution concerning access to legal \nmaterials and assistance\"). \nThere is little doubt that the physical condition of the law library was a \"policy\" of the \nsuperintendents, particularly given the small size of NCW. Indeed, Wayne testified that as a \nmatter of \"law library policy\" he moved the law library when he became superintendent so it \n\"would be easier to find volumes and reference material they were seeking.\" (3755:1-\n11.)[147] \nThere is also little doubt that the restrictions on segregation and orientation inmates' \nphysical access to the law library was a \"policy\" of the superintendents. For example, \nformer inmate Younger testified that prior to 1988 Lofgreen personally denied her physical \naccess to the law library while she was in segregation.[148] According to Younger, Lofgreen \ntold her that \"under current programming there was no access for segregation inmates to \nlegal materials.\" (5464:15-16.) Tewes approved of this policy of denying physical access \nwhen he authorized segregation inmates to have law books in segregation. (Ex. 146.)[149] \nFinally, there is little doubt that the superintendents denied physical access to the law library \nfor segregation and orientation inmates when they knew that NCW had not appointed \ntrained inmates as legal aides. \n\nFor example, inmate Lange submitted a law library grievance to Lofgreen in June, 1988, \nwhich specifically alleged, among other things, that \"most of the inmates here do not know \nwhat they are doing\" and \"[w]e need some one [sic] to help the [inmates] use the library.\" \n(Ex. 47.) Shortly after Tewes arrived at NCW, he received a request by inmate Lange \n(originally addressed to Lofgreen) to write to an NSP inmate legal aide regarding legal \nmatters. (Ex. 48.) Tewes denied the request, telling Lange to write to legal counsel for DCS \n\"[i]f you are in need of addition [sic] legal counseling or training.\" (Id.) Moreover, during \nLange's legal aide 1452*1452 training in August, 1988, but before she was appointed, Tewes \ndenied Lange the opportunity to assist an inmate in segregation. (Ex. 80.) \nIn summary, superintendents Lofgreen and Tewes are liable for the access-to-the-courts \nviolations because it was their policies that violated Bounds. \nB. Qualified Immunity \nThe defendants raise the defense of qualified immunity. I am not persuaded by their \narguments. \nIn Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), the Supreme \nCourt held that \"government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are \nshielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly \nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have \nknown.\" Id. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738; Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638-41, 107 \nS.Ct. 3034, 3038-40, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). A decision as to whether a \"clearly \nestablished\" right has been violated requires an inquiry into both the particular acts or \nomissions complained of and the case or statutory law which would have given a \nreasonable person cause to know that such acts or omissions would violate a constitutional \nright. Myers v. Morris, 810 F.2d 1437, 1459 n. 16 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 828, \n108 S.Ct. 97, 98 L.Ed.2d 58 (1987). Qualified immunity will apply if it was not clear that the \nactions complained of would violate a constitutional right, or if the defendants could \nreasonably have believed that their actions would not violate such a right. See Robison v. \nVia, 821 F.2d 913, 920-21 (2d Cir.1987). \nAs to the equal protection claims, similar suits have been successfully brought in different \njurisdictions since 1974. See, e.g., Canterino I, 546 F.Supp at 209-12; Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. \nat 1171-72 (quoting Barefield v. Leach, No. 10282 (D.N.M.1974)); Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at \n1079-83. These cases have established the general rule that disparity between programs \noffered to female and male inmates violates the Equal Protection Clause. This rule is settled \nenough to deny the defendants qualified immunity as to the equal protection claims. \nSimilarly, the second cause of action, alleging a Title IX claim, turns on the question of \ngender parity in the context of prisons. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-10; Canterino \nIII, 564 F.Supp. at 714-715. See also Beehler v. Jeffes, 664 F.Supp. at 938-41. The \ncontours of Title IX in the prison context are sufficiently well established so as to deny the \ndefendants qualified immunity as to this cause of action. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-\n10; Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-715. See also Beehler v. Jeffes, 664 F.Supp. at 938-\n41. \n\nFinally, the claims regarding access to the courts involve well-established areas of the law \nof which the defendants should reasonably have known. Bounds stated in 1977 that \"[i]t is \nnow established beyond doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the \ncourts.\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at 821, 97 S.Ct. at 1494. In January and June, 1988, Judges \nUrbom and Piester observed in Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 F.Supp. at 1135, on facts very \nsimilar to the ones presented here, that \"even a cursory review of the preexisting \nconstitutional law demonstrates the unconstitutionality of such a policy as the one \nchallenged here.\" Therefore, qualified immunity is also denied as to these claims. \nVI. Conclusion \nBecause of the length of this opinion, it may be helpful to summarize my findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. Such a summary follows.[150] \nUNCONTROVERTED FACTS \n1. The plaintiff Cheryl Klinger was an inmate assigned to the Nebraska Center for Women \n(NCW) from October 26, 1987, to July 11, 1988. \n2. The plaintiff Linda Lange was an inmate assigned to NCW from October 21, 1987, until \nOctober 12, 1989. \n1453*1453 3. The plaintiff Stacy Finn was an inmate assigned to NCW from December 28, \n1987, to December 14, 1989. \n4. The plaintiff Gweniver Lay was an inmate assigned to NCW from February 9, 1988, \nthrough November 28, 1988, and from June 16, 1989, through August 28, 1989. \n5. The defendant, Nebraska Department of Correctional Services (DCS), is and was, at all \ntimes relevant to the third amended complaint, the state agency in charge of matters \ninvolving the control and operation of Nebraska's correctional facilities. \n6. The defendant, DCS, operates the Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP) in Lincoln, \nNebraska, and the NCW in York, Nebraska. \n7. NSP houses only male inmates. \n8. NCW houses only female inmates. \n9. The defendant, DCS, receives federal funds to operate some educational programs in the \nNebraska correctional facilities. \n10. The defendant, Frank Gunter, was the director of the DCS until February 24, 1990, and \nwas an employee of the State of Nebraska, in that capacity. \n11. The defendant, Harold Clarke, has been the director of DCS since August 27, 1990, and \nis an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n\n12. The defendant, Larry Tewes, was the acting superintendent of the NCW from August 4, \n1988, to January 5, 1989, and was an employee of the State of Nebraska, in that capacity. \n13. The defendant, Victor Lofgreen, was the superintendent of the NCW until August 3, \n1988, and was an employee of the State of Nebraska, in that capacity. \n14. The defendant, Larry Wayne, has been the superintendent of the NCW since January 5, \n1989, and is an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n15. At all times relevant to the third amended complaint, the superintendent of the NCW \nwas and is responsible for the custody, control and correctional treatment of persons \ncommitted to that correctional facility and for the general administration of that correctional \nfacility in accordance with the laws and the Constitution of the United States. \n16. The defendant, Margrett Wehland, is and was at all times relevant to the third amended \ncomplaint, a medical nurse at NCW and an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n17. The defendant, Judith Danielson, is and was at all times relevant to the third amended \ncomplaint, a psychologist at NCW and an employee of the State of Nebraska. \n18. The defendants, Frank Gunter and Victor Lofgreen, are sued solely in their individual \ncapacities. \n19. The defendant, Harold Clarke, is sued solely in his official capacity. \n20. The defendants, Larry Wayne, Margrett Wehland, and Judith Danielson, are sued in \nboth their official and individual capacities. \nPROCEDURAL MATTERS \n21. This court has jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants and the subject matter of \nthis action. \n22. The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and this action \nis brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985 and 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n23. This case was properly certified as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and \n23(b)(2). \n24. The class has been defined as \"all female prisoners confined at NCW in York, Nebraska \nas of January 1, 1988 and all female prisoners who will be confined at NCW until the \nconclusion of this lawsuit.\" \n25. For practical purposes, the class consists of all women who were NCW inmates at any \ntime on or after January 1, 1988, through the conclusion of this case. \n\n26. When Judge Urbom granted summary judgment, he terminated this case as against \nJudith Danielson. \n27. The defendant, Larry Tewes, is sued in his individual capacity, not his official capacity, \nand then only regarding his actions as the acting superintendent of NCW. \n1454*1454 28. Evidence regarding events which took place prior to January 1, 1988, if \notherwise relevant, is admissible despite the fact that the class definition period began \nJanuary 1, 1988. \nEQUAL PROTECTION GENERALLY \n29. The proper test to judge the defendants' actions insofar as the equal protection claims \nare concerned is the test set forth in Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724-725, 102 S.Ct. at 3336-\n37, sometimes called the \"heightened scrutiny\" test, because women are assigned to NCW \non the basis of their sex. \n30. Hogan requires proof of two things in order to sustain the validity of a gender-based \nclassification: (a) the classification must be shown to serve an important governmental \nobjective, and (b) the means chosen to further the objective must be directly and \nsubstantially related to achievement of that objective. \n31. Most of the cases involving women's prisons have employed the \"heightened scrutiny\" \ntest. Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1455; Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-12; Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at \n1079-83. \n32. According to Pitts, the Hogan test is applicable to cases involving equal protection \nchallenges based upon classifications which assign women to prison according to gender: \n(a) where the women are substantially burdened by the challenged policies or programs \ncompared to similarly situated males; (b) where the challenged policies or programs do not \nimplicate the concerns set forth in Turner, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d \n64, regarding prison security or the day-to-day operations of the prison; (c) because facial \ngender classifications have traditionally drawn heightened scrutiny; and (d) because \nheightened scrutiny is appropriate inasmuch as the right sought to be enforced is the right \nto be treated equally as opposed to a personal right which is often limited as an inherent \npart of incarceration. \n33. NCW inmates are similarly situated to male inmates at NSP because: (a) the inmates at \nboth places are incarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction; (b) both NSP and NCW \nhold prisoners of similar classifications—medium and maximum; (c) minimum custody \ninmates at NCW are treated essentially the same as higher custody classification inmates at \nNCW and thus the minimum custody classification is irrelevant for comparison purposes; (d) \nthe general purposes of the State of Nebraska in administering the challenged programs \nappear to be similar at both NCW and NSP; (e) Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d at 1102, is not \napplicable because that case involved programs which directly implicated security issues \nand this case does not; and (f) the fact that there may have been a justifiable reason for \nsegregating men from women in the first place does not render men and women dissimilarly \n\nsituated, and the proper place to consider the reasons for segregation is when a \ncomparison of the relationship between the objective and the means is made. \n34. Insofar as prisons for women and equal protection are concerned, NSP and NCW are \nnot required to have identical programs, but rather programs which are \"substantially \nequivalent\"; that is, equal protection requires parity of treatment. Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at \n1079; Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. at 1171-72. \n35. Programs are not substantially equivalent solely because each institution has similar \nprograms if the programs available to women are inferior in design, execution, or \nboth. Glover IV, 721 F.Supp. at 837. \n36. Expenditures of money do not substitute for reasoned analysis. Glover III, 855 F.2d at \n288-89 (Engel, C.J., concurring). \n37. Economic considerations, such as the lack of an economy of scale at prisons housing \nwomen, cannot serve as an excuse for a failure to meet constitutional standards. Glover \nI, 478 F.Supp. at 1078; Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 207. \n38. The difference in cost at NCW as compared to NSP is a function of the number of \ninmates, and not some attribute of womanhood. \n39. In every category except administrative, the inmate-to-staff ratios at NCW and NSP are \ncomparable, which suggests that given the lack of an economy of scale, NCW receives \ninadequate resources. \n1455*1455 40. Spending is not a very good measure of equivalency. \n41. Although defendants did not articulate what governmental objective might warrant \ndifferences in treatment as between the inmates at NCW and NSP, the evidence suggests \nthat the State of Nebraska has an important governmental objective in seeing to the \nremediation of effects of gender bias suffered by female inmates prior to their entry into \nprison in order that the prison system might better address its statutory mission of preparing \ninmates for \"lawful community living.\" Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-901. \nEMPLOYMENT/ECONOMIC PROGRAMS \nHobbycraft \n42. At NSP, inmates can take orders to produce hobbycraft items, but at NCW, the crafts \nmust be purchased from a display case. \n43. The differences in the hobbycraft policy are slight, do not substantially burden the NCW \ninmates, and involve day-to-day operational details in which the court ought not to involve \nitself — no equal protection violation has been established with regard to this policy. \n\nPrivate Venture \n44. Since June, 1990, there has been a private venture business employing inmates at NSP \nbut not at NCW. \n45. The defendants are not responsible for the decision of a private venture to leave NCW, \nand where there is no evidence to suggest that defendants adopted a policy or practice of \npursuing or encouraging private venture employment for men and not women, the \ndefendants are not liable for the lack of private venture employment opportunities — no \nequal protection violation has been established with regard to this policy. \nState-paid Work Assignments \n46. There have been more categories of assignments at NSP than at NCW, but the general \npolicy was to provide the same types of assignments to both sets of inmates. \n47. NSP inmates are not substantially better off than NCW inmates regarding either the \nquality or quantity of state-paid work assignments — no equal protection violation has been \nestablished with regard to this policy. \nPay Policy \n48. Before May, 1989, when the policy changed, female inmates at NCW were paid on an \nhourly basis for their state-paid work assignments, but male inmates at NSP were paid for a \nday's work even if they worked only 15 minutes. \n49. The cost justification for the disparity in the pay policy is not a good enough reason for \nthe evident discrimination. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 211. \n50. Paying women less than men is not related to the reason for segregating men from \nwomen; such a policy proclaims that women, because they are women, are worth less than \nmen; and the policy conflicts with any legitimate state objectives — an equal protection \nviolation has been established with regard to this policy. \nEDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS \nAcademic \n51. Prior to October, 1990, the failure to offer on-site postsecondary education at NCW \nsubstantially burdened inmates at NCW given the fact that such offerings were available to \nmales at NSP — men could literally go to college and women could not. \n52. After October, 1990, the failure to offer on-site postsecondary education to females at \nNCW which would lead to a degree, and the failure to have a sufficient number of \noperational computers, substantially burdened the female inmates given the fact that male \n\ninmates at NSP could pursue on-site degree programs with operational computers—men \ncan get college degrees using adequate computers in their courses and women can not. \n53. Although traditionally female in nature, the secretarial technology course at NCW did not \nsubstantially burden females at NCW compared to the business \nadministration 1456*1456 course at NSP because the NCW course was generally responsive \nto inmate needs; the representative from SECC frequently surveyed inmate needs; some \nbusiness courses are now being offered; and some of the courses which are offered \nconstitute core courses for other areas of study including business — no equal protection \nviolation has been established in this regard. \n54. The prerequisites to the college correspondence courses, particularly during the time \nthere were no on-site college courses taught at NCW, substantially burdened the female \ninmates, given the fact that there were no similar prerequisites for males at NSP who \ndesired to take college correspondence courses. \n55. The Peru State College offering did not establish that the female inmates at NCW were \nuninterested in postsecondary education because: (a) the inmates were led to believe that \nthey had to pay $33.00 an hour in advance without financial assistance; (b) the proposed \nteachers were either high school teachers or a disliked NCW staff member; and (c) the Peru \nState College offerings were not as extensive as those at NSP. \n56. The fact, if it is a fact, that 60 percent of the males at NSP had either 12 years of \neducation or a GED is not a valid reason for denying educational opportunities to the \nfemales at NCW because: (a) NCW inmates tested well above the adult national average \nfor reading; (b) 25 percent of the NCW women had the ability to do college work; (c) the \nevidence fails to reveal the tested grade level for males and thus no comparison between \nmales and females regarding achievement can be made; and (d) the difference in grade \nlevels attended (12th grade vs. 11th grade) between the two inmate populations is \ninsignificant. \n57. The average-length-of-stay data does not provide a valid reason for denying educational \nopportunities to the females at NCW because: (a) length of stay is not used to determine \neligibility for males at NSP; (b) the differences in average length of stay between NCW and \nNSP \"medium\" custody inmates are small; and (c) even if one concentrates on the average \nlength of stay for \"maximum custody\" inmates, one out of five males stays less than 12 \nmonths, 40 percent stay less than 24 months, and since college work was offered to these \ninmates regardless of \"length of stay,\" it is obvious that the \"length-of-stay\" justification is \nnot a good reason for denying educational opportunities to women. \n58. Dr. Ryan, who found that NCW violated an educational standard regarding \"equity,\" \nprovided data which indicated that males at OCC, who had similar levels of educational \nattainment compared to the women, but who had lesser security classifications, were \noffered college courses even though length-of-stay data for these males was similar to such \ndata for a large proportion of females, thus suggesting that the \"length-of-stay\" justification \nis not a good reason for denying educational opportunities to women. \n\n59. Regarding the programs described above which have been found to have substantially \nburdened the female inmates at NCW, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal educational opportunities for women; (b) \nto the extent that such unequal opportunities are postulated on the \"special needs\" of \nwomen, such notions are an afterthought, predicated on stereotypical assumptions about \nwomen which are inaccurate or irrelevant; (c) there is virtually no evidence that the \ndifferences in educational programming were the product of the exercise of reasoned \ndiscretion as opposed to being based on the untested assumption that women required \ndifferent treatment; (d) the fact that women may have \"special needs\" is not a reason to \nprovide them lesser educational opportunities; and (e) these programs are not directly and \nsubstantially related to an important governmental objective—an equal protection violation \nhas been established regarding these programs. \nVocational \n60. Before July 1, 1991, the females at NCW who were enrolled in the clerical arts program \nwere not substantially burdened because the program lacked sufficient computer capacity \nas the goal of the program was 1457*1457 modest (to provide entry-level skills), and the \nvocational programs at NSP were of comparable quality if not taken for a degree — no \nequal protection violation has been established in this regard. \n61. Before July 1, 1991, the females at NCW were substantially burdened because they \nlacked the range of options that were made available to the men in vocational education in \nthat: (a) the women had only one course to choose from during most of the period of time \n(clerical arts); (b) they could not receive college credit or a degree pursuing such a program; \n(c) even when horticulture was offered for approximately a year, such a program could not \nbe taken for college credit or a degree, whereas the men at NSP had two courses to choose \nfrom (culinary arts and welding) which could be taken for college credit and a degree could \nbe received for pursuing such studies. \n62. After July 1, 1991, since NCW maintained at least one vocational education program \nand NSP none, the females were not substantially burdened for vocational education \npurposes — no equal protection violation has been established in this regard. \n63. The women at NCW were not substantially burdened by the number of CSI employment \noptions or the quality of CSI jobs at NCW as compared with NSP inasmuch as the women \nhad options, albeit fewer in number than the men, and the jobs appeared to be of \ncomparable quality — no equal protection violation has been established in this regard. \n64. Prior to July, 1991, the inmates at NCW who took jobs in the CSI sewing factory were \nsubstantially burdened since they did not receive preemployment training of the quality the \nmen received at NSP. \n65. Regarding the CSI sewing factory and preemployment training, after July, 1991, the \nwomen were not substantially burdened since they received preemployment training which \nwas similar in quality to that received by the men — after July, 1991, no equal protection \nviolation has been established. \n\n66. Regarding preemployment training for the data-entry program, the females at NCW are \nsubstantially burdened in that they receive no formalized preemployment training of any \nkind unless they need to know how to type, and, in any event, the preemployment training is \nnot similar in quality to that received by the men. \n67. The fact, if it is a fact, that NCW offered a truck-driving course and apprentice programs \nin the past but few, if any, inmates completed the programs is not persuasive evidence that \nthe NCW inmates were not interested in vocational education options because: (a) the \nevidence about these past offerings is sketchy; (b) given the fact that it would be difficult to \nobtain a job driving a truck with a felony record, it is not surprising that few people \ncompleted the course; (c) the apprentice programs were probably too difficult for males or \nfemales; (d) Dr. Ryan evidently thought there was a sufficient need for options in that she \nrecommended that the apprentice program be reactivated, thereby confirming the need for \nmore vocational programs; and (e) when a properly designed course, such as horticulture, \nwas offered as an option, the program was very successful. \n68. While the prevocational courses offered by NCW known as Living Skills and MOLD \nwere excellent, these programs did not address the vocational needs of the women and \nthus cannot be considered a substitute for a vocational program. \n69. The fact, if it is a fact, that a greater percentage of women take advantage of vocational \ntraining at NCW compared to males at NSP is not persuasive evidence that the females are \nnot burdened by inferior vocational programs because: (a) the order of magnitude between \nthe statistics reveals little — 7% of 560 NSP inmates is 40 inmates and 14% of 112 NCW \ninmates is 16 inmates; (b) the NSP programs take more time to complete and thus it is not \nsurprising that a greater number of inmates at NCW could take advantage of vocational \nprograms; (c) 25% to 30% of the NSP inmates would rather be idle, and since the \npercentage figures concerning use of programs fail to account for the desire of a substantial \nproportion of NSP males to do nothing, the use data is misleading; (d) if one excludes the \nmales who do not want to be active, the percentage of males 1458*1458 using vocational \nprograms increases by over 45% to about 10% of the NSP population; (d) on any given day \nthere are more male inmates at NSP who do not wish to be busy than there are female \ninmates in total at NCW; and (e) the fact that a relatively large percentage of the females \nwanted vocational education attests to the motivation of the females and not some \nperceived equality of programs. \n70. The fact, if it is a fact, that fewer women are \"idle\" at NCW compared to men at NSP is \nnot persuasive evidence that the females are not burdened by inferior vocational programs \nbecause: (a) the survey was hurriedly prepared and may be grossly misleading since it \ncounts as idle NSP men who worked half time and went to school half time; (b) the \n\"idleness\" study may have counted as \"idle\" a majority of inmates at NSP who both worked \nand went to school; (c) the study does not account for the great number of men (25% to \n30%) who want to be \"idle\"; (d) the \"idleness\" data may be contradicted by Dr. Ryan's study \nin that if one took her data and applied the methodology used to obtain the \"idleness\" data, \n75% of the females were \"idle\"; and (e) there was no showing that the \"idleness\" data was a \nfactor in programming decisions at NSP or NCW. \n\n71. Even setting aside the inherent difficulty in comparing costs between institutions of \nsubstantially different sizes, the cost data put forth by defendants is not persuasive since it \nincludes costs for Living Skills and MOLD which are prevocational in nature, and thus the \ndefendants' cost data wrongly inflates to an unknown degree the per capita costs for \neducating females. \n72. Regarding the programs described above which have been found to have substantially \nburdened the female inmates at NCW, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal vocational opportunities for women; (b) \nto the extent that such unequal opportunities are postulated on the \"special needs\" of \nwomen, such notions are an afterthought, predicated on stereotypical assumptions about \nwomen which are inaccurate or irrelevant; (c) there is virtually no evidence that the \ndifferences in vocational programming were the product of the exercise of reasoned \ndiscretion as opposed to being based on the untested assumption that women required \ndifferent treatment; (d) the fact that women may have \"special needs\" is not a reason to \nprovide them lesser vocational opportunities; and (e) these programs are not directly and \nsubstantially related to an important governmental objective — an equal protection violation \nhas been established regarding these programs. \nPrerelease \n73. Prerelease programs are designed to prepare an inmate for reentry into society, are \nconsidered by DCS to be academic and vocational in nature, and are important because \nthere is evidence that such programs reduce recidivism. \n74. Prerelease was fairly raised as an issue in the pretrial conference order, but even if it \nwere not, I would grant leave to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 as it is clear that defendants \nwere not surprised by the issue. \n75. The prerelease programs at NCW and NSP are not identical, but from a qualitative \nstandpoint they are comparable. \n76. Prerelease programs have not been offered at NCW on a regular basis since 1988; as a \nresult, the NCW inmates have been substantially burdened since January 1, 1989. \n77. Programs like MOLD do not serve as a substitute for prerelease programs since \nprerelease programs, as such, were admittedly very important. \n78. Regarding the prerelease program described above which has been found to have \nsubstantially burdened the female inmates at NCW, (a) there is nothing about the need to \nsegregate women from men that requires or justifies unequal prerelease opportunities for \nwomen; (b) to the extent that such unequal opportunities are postulated on the \"special \nneeds\" of women, such notions are an afterthought, predicated on stereotypical \nassumptions about women which are inaccurate or irrelevant; (c) there is virtually no \nevidence that the difference in prerelease programming was the product of the \nexercise 1459*1459 of reasoned discretion as opposed to being based on the untested \nassumption that women required different treatment; (d) the fact that women may have \n\n\"special needs\" is not a reason to provide them lesser prerelease opportunities; and (e) this \nprogram is not directly and substantially related to an important governmental objective — \nan equal protection violation has been established regarding this program. \nLAW LIBRARY PROGRAMS \nSegregation and Orientation \n79. Prior to and until November, 1989, the women inmates who were segregated from the \ngeneral population had no means of physical access to the law library and had to submit \nrequests for materials to Ms. Axdahl, but males seem to have been similarly burdened \naccording to Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1127-32 — while the female inmates may have \nproven a violation of Bounds, 430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 they have not \nproven they were substantially burdened for equal protection purposes. \n80. Prior to November, 1989, the women inmates segregated from the general population \nbecause they were in orientation had no means of physical access to the law library and \nhad to submit requests for materials to Ms. Axdahl. It is unclear how the NSP males in \norientation were treated. While the female inmates may have proven a violation \nof Bounds, 430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72, they have not proven they were \nsubstantially burdened for equal protection purposes. \nFacilities, Research Materials and Hours \n81. Simply because law libraries at prisons housing males and females are different in size \nor are operated differently does not mean that the women are substantially burdened for \nequal protection purposes. Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1096. \n82. Simply because the state provides a law library acceptable under Bounds does not \nmean that women are treated appropriately for equal protection purposes. Canterino II, 644 \nF.Supp. at 739-40. \n83. Prior to November, 1989, the law library was located in such a small room that \nindividuals who wished to do research had to stand in an aisle, and the legal materials, until \nthey were organized, were \"piled all over\" in an unusable condition; accordingly, the NCW \ninmates were substantially burdened in comparison to the NSP inmates who always had \nadequate facilities and an organized law library. \n84. Until either late 1989 or early 1990, the NCW law library did not contain a \"Shepard's\" \ncitator for Nebraska cases, and until October, 1990, the NCW law library did not contain a \n\"Shepard's\" citator for federal cases; accordingly, the NCW inmates were substantially \nburdened in comparison to the NSP inmates who always had adequate research materials. \n85. Throughout the relevant time period, the NCW inmates had only about 1/3 of the time \navailable to the NSP men to use the law library; accordingly, the NCW inmates were \nsubstantially burdened in comparison to the NSP inmates. \n\n86. The fact, if is a fact, that the women could order research regarding Shepard's citations \nfrom the NSP law library does not lessen the burden on the NCW inmates occasioned by \nthe lack of Shepard's citations because: (a) the process required the women to disclose \ntheir research projects to NCW staff, unlike the male inmates at NSP; and (b) the process of \nusing Shepard's citations by mailing research requests is slow and cumbersome. \n87. The fact, if it is a fact, that the NCW inmates can ask for extra time to use the law library \ndoes not lessen the impact of the time restrictions on the NCW inmates because: (a) the \npolicy is new and perhaps an accident; (b) the policy is not written and is ripe for arbitrary \nenforcement; (c) the policy requires the NCW inmate to disclose why the extra time is \nneeded; and (d) the policy is subject to the availability of NCW staff, and staff availability \nhas been a significant problem. \n88. The fact, if it is a fact, that more men use the NSP law library than females use the \nNCW law library is not indicative that the 1460*1460 females are not burdened, inasmuch as \nNCW law library usage has doubled since 1988. \n89. With regard to the programs described above which have been found to have \nsubstantially burdened the NCW inmates, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal law library opportunities for women; (b) \nthe suggestion, implicit in the substantially unequal programs, that women do not need law \nlibrary facilities similar to those provided the men at NSP smacks of archaic notions of \ngender roles; and (c) the programs are not directly and substantially related to an important \ngovernmental objective—an equal protection violation has been established regarding these \nprograms. \nMEDICAL AND DENTAL PROGRAMS \nFacilities and Doctors \n90. While NCW relies upon the facilities of a local hospital and NSP has a hospital on its \ngrounds, the inmates at NCW are not substantially burdened by these differences because \nthere was no showing that the local hospital provided less than comparable care — no \nequal protection violation has been established regarding this program. \n91. While NCW does not have a full-time doctor, and NSP does have a full-time doctor, \nthere is no convincing evidence that the lack of a full-time doctor results in poor care \ncompared to the care received by the male inmates at NSP — no equal protection violation \nhas been established regarding this program. \n92. Both NSP and NCW use the same type of procedure for referral to a doctor — no equal \nprotection violation has been established regarding this program. \nEmergency Medical Coverage and Dental Care \n\n93. At NSP, there is a full-time nurse on duty around the clock, while at NCW there is no \naround-the-clock medical coverage on grounds; accordingly, the NCW inmates are \nsubstantially burdened by the lack of such coverage in the event of a medical emergency. \n94. The fact, if it is a fact, that the NCW nurses are available by telephone to consult in the \nevent of a medical emergency is not an adequate substitute for on-grounds nursing \ncoverage, as particularly evidenced by the incidents involving inmates Younger and Griffin. \n95. The fact, if it is a fact, that no around-the-clock nursing coverage exists at OCC and \nHCC does not disprove an equal protection violation because: (a) DCS is endeavoring to \nprovide such coverage for the great majority of male inmates in DCS custody; (b) there was \nlittle evidence about the ability of HCC or OCC to respond in the event of a medical \nemergency and thus no comparison can be made; and (c) the comparison institution is \nNSP, not OCC or HCC. \n96. From 1988 through August, 1990, a contract dentist provided dental care about 4 hours \nper week at NCW, whereas during this time frame, a dentist and a dental hygienist were \nengaged full time at NSP; inasmuch as there was a backlog of NCW patients needing \ndental care from December, 1988, to August, 1990, the resulting lack of timely dental care \nsubstantially burdened the NCW inmates, as particularly evidenced by the lack of treatment \nof inmate Williamson. \n97. The fact, if it is a fact, that the backlog in dental care did not amount to a violation of the \nEighth Amendment does not disprove an equal protection violation. \n98. The court does not second-guess DCS with regard to the need for around-the-clock \nnursing coverage inasmuch as DCS informed the Nebraska legislature that such coverage \nwas needed, and the willingness to risk the safety of NCW female inmates but not NSP \nmale inmates devalues the female inmates, which is an historic characteristic of gender \nbias. \n99. The fact, if it is a fact, that the NCW inmate population increased during part of the \nperiod of the dental backlog does not establish a noninvidious explanation for the dental \nbacklog since prior to the increase in population the inmate-to-available-dental-hour ratio \ngreatly favored the NSP men. \n100. With regard to the programs described above which have been found to \nhave 1461*1461 substantially burdened the NCW inmates, (a) there is nothing about the \nneed to segregate women from men that requires or justifies unequal medical or dental care \nfor women; (b) the willingness to take risks with the NSP women but not the NSP men \nregarding around-the-clock nursing coverage devalues women inmates, a historic \ncharacteristic of gender discrimination; and (c) the programs are not directly and \nsubstantially related to an important governmental objective — an equal protection violation \nhas been established regarding these programs. \nMENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS \n\nSubstance Abuse Treatment \n101. As to substance abuse treatment which does not require inpatient treatment, with the \nexception of a few months, NCW inmates have always had available to them specific \neducation and counseling regarding substance abuse problems from a certified drug and \nalcohol counselor, whereas at NSP, in contrast, no treatment groups are held specifically to \naddress substance abuse problems; accordingly, the NCW inmates are not substantially \nburdened by any differences in treatment — no equal protection violation has been \nestablished regarding this program. \nRegular or \"Straight\" Treatment \n102. Until August, 1990, when Deb Fitzgerald was hired, the NCW women were \nsubstantially burdened by the comparative lack of \"straight\" or regular treatment in that \nJudith Danielson was the only person at NCW who could provide such treatment and she \nwas too busy to do so, whereas the males at NSP were able to receive such treatment from \na psychologist and four mental health counselors. \n103. Indeed, the DCS chief of psychology described the situation at NCW as one where \n\"little on-going treatment previously occured [sic].\" \n104. The per capita cost figures do not disprove an equal protection violation, and, given the \nlack of an economy of scale at NCW, may tend to confirm the disparity. \n105. After August, 1990, when Deb Fitzgerald was hired, the NCW women were no longer \nsubstantially burdened by a lack of \"straight\" treatment — no equal protection violation has \nbeen established regarding this time frame. \n106. With regard to the program described above which has been found to have \nsubstantially burdened the NCW inmates, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal mental health care for women; and (b) \nthe program is not directly and substantially related to an important governmental objective \n— an equal protection violation has been established regarding this program. \nInpatient Programs \n107. During all relevant times, males at NSP could receive specialized and intensive \ninpatient treatment at a DCS facility, designed to address the special needs of prisoners, in \nfour areas: substance abuse, sexual offenses, serious mental illness, and social or \ndevelopmental impairment, but the females had no similar opportunities; accordingly, the \nNCW inmates were substantially burdened. \n108. At best, NCW inmates can receive treatment at a state mental hospital which is not \ncontrolled by DCS, and this transfer opportunity does not provide comparable treatment \nbecause: (a) NCW women cannot be treated for substance abuse at the state hospital; and \n\n(b) the programs at the state hospitals, unlike the DCS programs for males, are not \ndesigned to deal with the unique personalities of criminals. \n109. As the head of psychology for DCS observed: \"At the NCW as women inmates seek \nparity and equality with the mental health services offered to male inmates, additional \nresources will need to be developed to address the growing needs of these women. There \nalso is a need for increased ability to treat women with major mental and behavioral \ndisturbances as evidenced by the necessity to transfer women to the Department of Public \nInstitutions....\" \n110. The DCS program which serves NSP and other male inmates provides specialized and \nintense treatment, and there is no reason to believe that women inmates lack the need for \nsimilar treatment. \n1462*1462 111. With regard to the program described above which has been found to have \nsubstantially burdened the NCW inmates, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal mental health care for women; (b) the \nsuggestion, implicit in the unequal treatment, that women do not need the same intensity of \ntreatment devalues women and is characteristic of gender bias; and (c) the program is not \ndirectly and substantially related to an important governmental objective—an equal \nprotection violation has been established regarding this program. \nRECREATION \nHours, Numbers, and Sophistication of Programs \n112. At all relevant times, NCW women were substantially burdened compared with their \nfellow NSP inmates in both general recreational opportunities and art and hobbycraft \nopportunities in the following ways: (a) in the number of hours of recreational, art and \nhobbycraft opportunities available to the women, particularly when no activities coordinator \nwas employed, and (b) in the number and sophistication of recreational, art and hobbycraft \nactivities available to the women, particularly when no activities coordinator was employed. \n113. The men have much greater access to their gym. \n114. The men have much greater access to their \"yard.\" \n115. Defendants \"readily admit that more recreational activities are scheduled at NSP than \nNCW\" — in fact, the numbers and sophistication of such activities greatly favor NSP males. \n116. The assertion that women at NCW are not burdened because they are much less \"idle\" \nthan the NSP men is not persuasive for, among other reasons, even if one assumes the \nvalidity of the \"idleness\" data, many men at NSP are not \"idle,\" and for these men NSP \nprovides a much better recreational program than for similarly busy female inmates at \nNCW. \n\n117. Even if one accepts the assertion that the females at NCW have not complained, it is \nfallacious to assume that the inmates at NCW do not want or need comparable recreation \nprograms. \n118. With regard to the program described above which has been found to have \nsubstantially burdened the NCW inmates, (a) there is nothing about the need to segregate \nwomen from men that requires or justifies unequal recreational opportunities for women; (b) \nthe suggestion, implicitly made regarding the \"idleness\" data, that women do not want or \nneed similar recreational opportunities devalues women and is characteristic of gender bias; \nand (c) the programs are not directly and substantially related to an important governmental \nobjective — an equal protection violation has been established regarding these programs. \nPlant and Equipment \n119. Although the plant and equipment at NCW and NSP are different, the NCW women are \nnot substantially burdened by any differences as there is little reason to believe the \ndifferences cause any serious limitation in activities — no equal protection violation has \nbeen established in this regard. \nOrientation \n120. Orientation inmates at NCW may use the law library during their one hour of recreation \nand for additional periods of time as needed. \n121. The orientation inmates have access to indoor recreation but not outdoor recreation. \n122. Since the orientation period is fairly short (normally not more than 30 days), and the \nNCW orientation inmates are offered some recreational opportunities, the NCW inmates are \nnot substantially burdened when compared to their male counterparts, even if it is assumed \nthat the male orientation inmates have somewhat more liberal recreation privileges — no \nequal protection violation has been established in this regard. \nSegregation \n123. From my tour of the two facilities, it appears that the recreation facilities for inmates in \nsegregation are similar, and thus 1463*1463 the inmates at NCW are not substantially \nburdened by any difference in facilities for segregation inmates — no equal protection \nviolation has been established in this regard. \n124. To the extent that during a short period of time (January through April, 1990) NCW \nsegregation inmates were confined to exercise indoors (in a hallway), but the males were \ngranted outdoor exercise privileges, such a burden was not substantial — no equal \nprotection violation has been established in this regard. \nVISITATION \n\nGeneral Population \n125. At NCW, women can have visitors during four-hour blocks of time on Thursday, Friday, \nSaturday, and holidays; for a time, those visits could not exceed 20 hours per month. \n126. At NCW, women who are mothers can also have MOLD visits where the inmate visits \nwith her child on grounds overnight for a period of up to five 24-hour blocks of time each \nmonth; the NSP men have no similar visitation opportunities. \n127. NSP inmates may have up to 8 hours of visitation on weekdays or 4 hours on \nweekends, but in order to reduce visiting on weekends, an NSP inmate may not have \nvisitations on both weekdays and weekends. \n128. There was no monthly visitation limit for NSP inmates. \n129. The fact that males at NSP can have more hours of general visitation per week does \nburden the females, but the burden is not substantial and the differences involve operational \ndetail in which the court ought not to involve itself, Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1464 — no equal \nprotection violation has been established. \nOrientation \n130. Sometime after late spring or early summer of 1988, the orientation inmates at NCW \nhad privileges similar to the general population at NCW — since the general population is \nnot substantially burdened, the orientation inmates are likewise not substantially burdened \nby the same policy. \n131. Until the policy changed in late spring or early summer of 1988, the NCW orientation \ninmates, unlike NSP inmates in orientation, were not allowed to have visitors or use the \ntelephone; accordingly, the females at NCW were substantially burdened by the differences \nin visitation policies. \n132. There was a legitimate penological purpose in prohibiting orientation inmates of either \nsex from having visitations or using the telephone; that is, the state had a legitimate interest \nin easing the transition from citizen to prisoner. \n133. The means — a quarantine — is directly and substantially related to the objective — \neasing transition to prison life, and, since the NCW policy was changed soon after NCW \nlearned of the differences in treatment between males at NSP and females at NCW, the \noriginal NCW nongender-based policy was not a pretext for discrimination and was \nevidently not used because of some archaic notion about women — no equal protection \nviolation has been established in this regard. \nTITLE IX \n\n134. Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688, prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs \nreceiving federal assistance, and applies to prisons. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-\n10; Beehler v. Jeffes, 664 F.Supp. at 940. \n135. DCS received federal funds under the Perkins Act, 20 U.S.C. § 2301, et seq. \n136. The Perkins Act funds were used in DCS adult prison prerelease programs from at \nleast 1988 through at least July 1, 1991. \n137. DCS and Gunter gave assurances of nondiscrimination in an application for Perkins \nAct monies. \n138. Since plaintiffs have established a denial of equal protection of the laws from January \n1, 1989, to the present by virtue of the failure of NCW to offer regularly scheduled \nprerelease programs to NCW inmates, the plaintiffs have also proven a violation of Title IX \nfrom at least January 1, 1989, to at least July 1, 1991, because DCS received Perkins Act \nfunds for such prerelease programs. \n1464*1464 139. Setting aside the question of damages, defendants have cited no convincing \nprecedent for the proposition that intentional discrimination is an element of a cause of \naction under Title IX where the classification is explicitly based on gender; the precedent is \nto the contrary. Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15. \n140. It is likely, however, that intentional discrimination must be shown under Title IX in \norder to recover damages. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., ___ U.S. at ___, 112 \nS.Ct. at 1037. \n141. Intentional discrimination can be shown in a number of ways, and (a) disproportionate \nimpact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of invidious discrimination; and (b) \ndiscriminatory purpose is central to the inquiry, but the challenged action need not be \nmotivated solely or even primarily by a discriminatory purpose. Village of Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 265-68, 97 S.Ct. at 563-65. \n142. Intentional discrimination has been shown in this case because: (a) there has clearly \nbeen proven a disproportionate impact (substantial burden) upon NCW females resulting \nfrom the gender classification regarding the prerelease program specifically and NCW \nprograms generally; (b) applying Hogan and Pitts, it has been established that the means \ncausing the substantial burdens are premised upon stereotypical or archaic notions of \nwomen and are not directly and substantially related to legitimate governmental objectives; \nand (c) defendants Gunter and Clarke, directors of DCS, displayed deliberate indifference \nto, or tacit authorization of, the practices which violated the Equal Protection Clause and \nTitle IX. \n143. The Eleventh Amendment immunity of the State of Nebraska was abrogated regarding \nthe Title IX violation by the Civil Rights Remedies Equalization Amendment of 1986, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d-7. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at \n1036. \n\nACCESS TO THE COURTS \n144. In 1977, the Supreme Court held that \"the fundamental constitutional right of access to \nthe courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of \nmeaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate \nassistance from persons trained in the law.\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at 828, 97 S.Ct. at \n1498 (footnote omitted). \n145. In January and June, 1988, Magistrate Judge Piester and Judge Urbom found that \n\"[t]he simple fact is that if the state denies a prisoner direct physical access to a law library, \nthe state must provide that prisoner, no matter what his status, with assistance by trained, \nskilled, and independent legal personnel.\" Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1132. \n146. No showing of actual prejudice is required where the inmate establishes that the \nsystem of providing access to the courts is not in compliance with Bounds. Reutcke, 707 \nF.Supp. at 1129. \nSegregation and Orientation Inmates \n147. It was not until sometime in January, 1989, that a trained inmate legal aide was \nappointed to assist NCW inmates. \n148. The orientation and segregation inmates at NCW had no physical access to the law \nlibrary until November, 1989. \n149. A violation of Bounds has been established regarding the inmates who were in \nsegregation or orientation at NCW until January, 1989, since these inmates had no physical \naccess to the law library or the assistance of a trained legal aide — a violation \nof Bounds has been established for this period of time. \n150. The system of asking Ms. Axdahl for assistance was not an adequate substitute for a \ntrained inmate legal aide because she was not independent. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1132. \n151. After January, 1989, since NCW provided the assistance of a trained inmate legal aide, \nNCW provided all that Bounds required as there is no requirement that the state provide \nboth a law library and trained legal assistance, so long as either method alone is found \nadequate to satisfy the \"meaningful assistance\" requirement of Bounds. Reutcke, 707 \nF.Supp. at 1131 n. 21. \n1465*1465 152. The availability of and training for the inmate legal aide was sufficient to \nprovide \"meaningful assistance\" as required under Bounds, and, accordingly, after January, \n1989, there was no violation of Bounds insofar as the segregation and orientation inmates \nare concerned. \nGeneral Population \n\n153. Prior to January, 1989, plaintiffs have proven a violation of Bounds because: (a) no \ntrained and independent inmate legal aide had been appointed; and (b) the law library was \nnot adequate in that one had to \"stand in the aisle\" because the only table was a small \ntypewriter stand, and the legal materials were not organized but \"just were kind of piled all \nover.\" \n154. Although the Bounds Court considered the failure to include Shepard's Citations in the \ncollection list of a prison law library as a \"questionable omission,\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at 819-\n20 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. at 1493-94 n. 4, the Court did not conclude that such an omission \nestablished a violation of the right of access to the courts, and other courts have generally \nfound such an omission does not establish a constitutional violation. Lindquist, 776 F.2d at \n856. \n155. After January 1, 1989, an inmate legal aide was appointed and she organized the law \nlibrary. \n156. The inmate legal aide testified that after her training she could \"look up a case\"; she \ndeveloped a familiarity with a \"few\" forms for filing cases; and, although not satisfied with \nthe results, she was able to file suit in a variety of situations. \n157. The Court's main concern in Bounds was protecting the ability of an inmate to prepare \na complaint. Bounds, 430 U.S. at 828 n. 17, 97 S.Ct. at 1498 n. 17. \n158. After January 1, 1989, since a trained and independent legal aide was appointed, \ndespite the problems with the law library, the minimum requirements of Bounds were \nsatisfied — no violation of the right of access to the courts has been established for this \ntime frame. \nRelationship Between Equal Protection Claim and \nAccess Claim \n159. The NCW inmates do not contend that the number of hours the library was open \nviolated their right of access to the courts under Bounds, although they do claim that the \nfact that the library hours at NCW are less than 1/3 of the time available to the men at NSP \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. \n160. The position of the plaintiffs described in the preceding paragraph is not \ninconsistent. Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. at 740-41. \n161. Even though Bounds does not require NCW to provide both an adequate law library \nand trained inmate legal aides, the combination of an equal protection violation and the \nviolation of Bounds may justify a remedy greatly exceeding the minimum requirements \nof Bounds. Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. at 740-41. \nMEDICAL \n\n162. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants have been deliberately indifferent to the serious \nmedical needs of the NCW inmates, and have thereby violated the Eighth \nAmendment. Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292. \n163. In most respects, the facts of this case are similar to the facts in Canterino I, 546 \nF.Supp. at 199-201, and there, the court found no Eighth Amendment violation. Id. at 214-\n15. \n164. However, unlike Canterino I, there was troubling evidence in this case of either lack of \ntreatment or delay in treatment respecting serious medical needs, as evidenced by (a) the \n\"bee-sting\" incident involving inmate Younger who went into shock, (b) the postsurgery \ntroubles of inmate Griffin who had significant bleeding, and (c) the incident involving inmate \nWilliamson who waited a year to receive dental care which, according to the dentist, \nrequired treatment \"ASAP.\" Johnson, 941 F.2d at 707. \n165. Each of these incidents was serious enough so as to implicate the Eighth \nAmendment. Hudson, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1000. \n1466*1466 166. To the extent that she was involved in the actual treatment, the actions of \ndefendant Wehland (a nurse) were such that it cannot be concluded that she consciously \nrefused to take steps to deal with the problem. Manual of Model Jury Instructions for the \nDistrict Courts of the Eighth Circuit § 4.14, at 61. \n167. While there is cause for concern about whether defendants were deliberately \nindifferent, the evidence does not persuade me that any of the defendants subjectively or \nobjectively intended to punish the NCW inmates; accordingly, no Eighth Amendment \nviolation has been established. Wilson, ___ U.S. at ___-___, 111 S.Ct. at 2323-25. \nLIABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS \nPersonal Involvement \n168. The remaining individual defendants held supervisory positions with DCS or NCW. \n169. Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 imposes liability where there is an affirmative link between the \noccurrence of an incident of misconduct and the adoption of a plan or policy—express or \notherwise — showing the supervisory officials' authorization or approval of the \nmisconduct. Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 370-71, 96 S.Ct. at 603-04. \n170. A prison official may be held liable if culpability is established in one of three ways: (a) \npersonal administrative involvement, (b) personal knowledge, or (c) through breach of a \nlegal duty that proximately causes the injury. Johnson-El, 878 F.2d at 1049-50. \nEqual Protection/Title IX Violations — Gunter and \nClarke \n\n171. A prison official is responsible for his or her own acts or failures to act where the official \nis on notice of a constitutional violation and despite having the authority to counteract the \nviolation, fails to do so. Gunter and Clarke are liable. Santiago, 774 F.Supp. at 790. \n172. Both Gunter and Clarke, as directors of DCS, had the right and affirmative duty under \nstate law to make policy for all institutions housing prisoners in Nebraska, including the \npower to hire and fire superintendents at NCW and to delegate (or refrain from delegating) \npowers to such superintendents. Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-173. \n173. Pursuant to Jane Doe A, 901 F.2d at 645-47, the court should judge the actions of the \ndefendants based upon a four-part test causing an inquiry as to: (a) whether the defendant \nreceived notice of a pattern of unconstitutional acts committed by others; (b) whether the \ndefendant demonstrated deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the offensive \nacts; (c) whether the defendant failed to take sufficient remedial action; and (d) whether any \nfailure to take sufficient remedial action proximately caused the injury or damage. \n174. It is beyond question that Gunter and Clarke received notice of the unconstitutional \nviolations because: (a) in a memo in February, 1988, Gunter was told of superintendent \nLofgreen's warning of complaints by NCW inmates and the fact that NCW could not offer \nacademic and vocational programs \"anywhere near as comprehensive\" as those at NSP \nand other male institutions; (b) both Gunter and Clarke were present at a meeting in March, \n1988, when a very detailed grievance by more than half the inmates at NCW was submitted \ndescribing complaints about lack of parity in programs and services implicating virtually \nevery facet of prison life; (c) Gunter had further notice when the federal lawsuit was filed in \nJuly, 1988; and (d) Gunter received additional notice from a report authored by a DCS \nconsultant, Dr. Ryan, in May, 1989, which indicated that inequality existed in vocational and \neducational programs at NCW, and that such inequality had resulted in litigation. \n175. Gunter, and later Clarke, displayed deliberate indifference to, or tacit authorization of, \nthe offensive practices in that: (a) aside from an investigation by DCS legal counsel that \nevidently took not much more than seven days, Gunter caused little or no investigation to be \nmade of the detailed inmate grievance; (b) although the inmates at NCW were notified of \nthe formation of a \"task force,\" Gunter's task force did nothing of substance even though \n\"review of this 1467*1467 grievance [was] its first task\"; (c) after creating the task force, \nGunter did nothing to invigorate it; (d) Gunter promised the inmates certain reforms, but only \none was implemented in a timely fashion and it took the filing of a lawsuit before the \npromised equal pay and training for inmate legal aides was accomplished; (e) the filing of \nthe lawsuit did not prompt Gunter to investigate further; (f) although Gunter personally met \nwith Dr. Ryan, Dr. Ryan's report did not prompt Gunter to act; and (g) when Clarke became \ndirector he had \"definite intentions\" to become familiar with \"equity issues,\" but he did not \npursue the matter to any significant degree. Howard v. Adkison, 887 F.2d at 138. \n176. Gunter and Clarke failed to take sufficient remedial measures; indeed, more than four \nyears after the NCW inmate grievance, some of the offensive practices still exist. \n177. The failure to take adequate and timely remedial measures was certainly a proximate \ncause (if not the only cause) of the fact of damage and injury. \n\n178. The fact, if it is a fact, that there were procedures at DCS intended to assure \n\"consistency\" does not disprove deliberate indifference because: (a) as Clarke admitted, \nthere was no person responsible for parity at DCS; (b) the appointment of the \"task force\" is \nhighly probative evidence that existing systems were not effective; (c) the fact that the \"task \nforce\" did nothing is highly probative evidence that the directors were deliberately \nindifferent; (d) the Ryan report is highly probative evidence that the \"consistency\" \nprocedures were not effective; (e) the fact that the Ryan report did not prompt action is \nhighly probative evidence that the directors were deliberately indifferent; (f) the procedure \nfor reviewing DCS regulations and institutional operational memoranda did not involve \ncomparisons to determine whether women were receiving parity of treatment; (g) \naccreditation reviews did not involve comparisons of institutions to determine parity of \ntreatment; and (h) the meetings of the institutional heads were not intended, as Clarke \nadmitted, to discuss or compare programs. \nEqual Protection/Title IX Violations — Remaining \nDefendants \n179. Although Wehland was the \"head nurse\" and in that capacity had certain program \nresponsibilities, I do not understand the plaintiffs to claim that she was sufficiently \npersonally involved in the decision process so as to have liability for equal protection or Title \nIX violations — Wehland is not liable. \n180. In any event, the evidence is not sufficient to support a finding against Wehland; for \nexample, it was a DCS staff person who ultimately decided that nursing coverage would not \nbe provided 24 hours a day at NCW — Wehland is not liable. \n181. As to the superintendents, before they can have liability for the violations they must \nhave had the power and knowledge to deal with the violations — the superintendents are \nnot liable for the equal protection and Title IX violations. Slakan, 737 F.2d at 373. \n182. The power of the superintendents under Nebraska law is limited, Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-\n177, the director of DCS, and the director alone, sets policy, Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-173(3), and \nit is the director who delegates appropriate powers to the facility heads. Neb.Rev.Stat. § 83-\n173(4). \n183. The evidence strongly indicates that the superintendents did not have the delegated \nauthority to make decisions about what programs to offer, as Clarke, who had been a \nwarden before becoming director, stated: \"Basically the programs are set at the DCS level \n... [W]e did not question ... why.\" \n184. When Gunter appointed the \"task force,\" he did not want one person to authorize an \nexception to policy, and once Gunter essentially denied the NCW inmate grievance and \nrefused to change most of the existing programs at NCW, the superintendents had no \nauthority to consider \"parity\" issues. \n185. The superintendents were ill-suited to deal with far-reaching policy questions like \n\"parity\" because such questions required comparisons between institutions housing males \n\nand females, and as Clarke stated, a \"particular superintendent is not positioned to know \nwhat's occurring in one facility vs. [another].\" \n1468*1468 186. These factors — lack of power and knowledge — distinguish this case \nfrom Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15, insofar as the superintendents are concerned. \nAccess-to-the-Courts Violations \n187. Since the violations regarding access to the courts ended in January, 1989, Wayne \nhas no liability because he did not become superintendent until January, 1989. \n188. Since the violations regarding access to the courts ended in January, 1989, Clarke can \nhave no liability because he did not become director until August, 1990, and there is no \nevidence that the directors of DCS were aware of or sanctioned the access-to-the-courts \nviolations. \n189. Gunter is not liable for the access-to-the-courts violations because he did not have \nsufficient personal involvement in the violations; in particular, the March, 1988, grievance \nfrom the NCW inmates was phrased in terms of parity and did not specifically complain \nabout the inadequate law library or the restrictions on the use of the law library by inmates \nin segregation or orientation. \n190. While the issues presented in Reutcke v. Dahm, or very similar issues, were detailed in \na memorandum addressed to Gunter in February, 1988, the memorandum did not give \nGunter notice that NCW was not in compliance with Reutcke. \n191. This does not mean that Gunter escapes liability for an equal protection violation that \nalso constituted an access-to-the-courts violation; that is, Gunter is liable for the equal \nprotection violation regarding the law library because the library was poor compared to the \nNSP library; the issue of parity was Gunter's responsibility; he had specific notice of the \nclaim of inequality; and he did nothing of substance to deal with it. \n192. It is not inconsistent to also conclude that Gunter escapes liability because the law \nlibrary did not comply with Bounds, inasmuch as compliance with Bounds was the \nresponsibility of the individual superintendents and Gunter was not notified of the \nnoncompliance with Bounds. \n193. There can be more than one proximate cause of injury or damage and different liability \ntheories for each proximate cause. \n194. Since it was their policies which ran afoul of Bounds, Lofgreen and Tewes are liable for \nthe access-to-the-courts violations. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1134. \n195. There is little doubt that the physical condition of the law library was the \"policy\" of the \nsuperintendents, given the small size of NCW and the fact that Wayne recognized he was \ndealing with \"policy\" when he moved the library upon becoming superintendent so \"it would \nbe easier to find volumes and reference material they were seeking.\" \n\n196. There is little doubt that the restrictions on segregation and orientation inmates' \nphysical access to the law library was a \"policy\" of the superintendents; for example, inmate \nYounger testified that Lofgreen personally denied her access to the law library when she \nwas in segregation and Tewes approved a policy of denying physical access to the law \nlibrary when he authorized segregation inmates to have law books in segregation (a policy \nwhich also violated Bounds, according to Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1130). \n197. There is little doubt that Lofgreen and Tewes knew there were no trained inmate legal \naides, and they knew the inmates claimed to need help, as evidenced by (a) the Lange \ngrievance to Lofgreen in June, 1988, (b) the Lange communication form regarding writing to \nthe NSP legal aide answered by Tewes in August, 1988, and (c) the Lange correspondence \nabout assisting an inmate in segregation answered by Tewes in August, 1988. \n198. Lofgreen and Tewes are liable for the access-to-the-courts violations. \nQualified Immunity \n199. Government officials who perform discretionary functions are shielded from liability for \ncivil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Harlow, 457 U.S. at \n818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738; Creighton, 483 U.S. at 638-41, 107 S.Ct. at 3038-40. \n1469*1469 200. A decision as to whether a right is clearly established requires an inquiry into \nthe particular acts or omissions and the law which would have given a reasonable person \nnotice that such acts or omissions would violate constitutional rights. Myers, 810 F.2d at \n1459 n. 16. \n201. As to the equal protection claims, similar suits have been successfully brought in \ndifferent jurisdictions since 1974, and the law is settled enough to deny defendants qualified \nimmunity as to the equal protection claims. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-\n12; Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. at 1171-72 (quoting Barefield v. Leach, No. 10282 \n(D.N.M.1974); Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1079-83. \n202. The contours of Title IX in the prison context are sufficiently well established so as to \ndeny the defendants qualified immunity as to this claim. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 209-\n10; Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15; Beehler, 664 F.Supp. at 938-41. \n203. The claims regarding access to the courts involve well-established areas of the law, \nand therefore qualified immunity is denied as to these claims. Bounds, 430 U.S. at 821, 97 \nS.Ct. at 1494; Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1135. \nAccordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n(1) As to the defendants for whom the court has found no liability (Wayne, Wehland, and \nDanielson), the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska shall \n\nwithhold judgment pending conclusion of the remedial phase of trial regarding the remaining \ndefendants for whom the court has found liability; \n(2) Within ten (10) days of this date, plaintiffs' counsel shall confer with defendants' counsel \nand the chambers of Judge Kopf to schedule a telephone conference, and within ten (10) \ndays of this date plaintiffs' counsel shall initiate a telephone conference with the court and \ncounsel to discuss the remedial phase of trial; \n(3) During the telephone conference, counsel shall be prepared to discuss whether the \ncourt should permit an interlocutory appeal by either plaintiffs or defendants pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(b). \n[*] Editor's Note: In the original complaint, Victor Lofgreen was listed as the initial defendant; thus this case was \nknown and referred to as Klinger v. Lofgreen despite changes made in the caption in subsequent complaints. \n[1] Because of plaintiffs' lack of funds, the court reporter agreed to produce an unedited, computer-generated \ntranscript at a substantially reduced cost for use by the parties in preparation of their posttrial briefs. I have referred to \nthis unedited transcript in this memorandum. If an edited transcript is prepared for purposes of appeal, that transcript \nmay, of course, vary from the unedited transcript. The Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of \nNebraska shall file the unedited transcript with the exhibits in this case. \n[2] It is my intention that any finding of fact which is more appropriately considered a conclusion of law shall be so \nconstrued, and it is likewise my intention that any conclusion of law which is more appropriately considered a finding \nof fact shall be so construed. \n[3] After various amended complaints were filed, it is clear that the court has jurisdiction over the persons of the \ndefendants and it is equally clear that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3). This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985, and 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n[4] The law firm of Baylor, Evnen, Curtiss, Grimit & Witt represented the named plaintiffs and later the class. Three \nlawyers from the Baylor firm appeared at trial for the plaintiffs: Ms. Perry, Mr. Grimit, and Mr. Dudley. Appointed \ncounsels' service was of the very highest caliber, no doubt at great personal sacrifice to the lawyers, who, of course, \nwere not being paid. The court appreciates the willingness of counsel to accept the appointment in this case. \n[5] Defendants argue that the class does not consist of persons who were incarcerated at NCW after January 1, \n1988, but released before the conclusion of this lawsuit. Stated differently, defendants contend that the class includes \nonly those (1) who were incarcerated on January 1, 1988, or (2) who are incarcerated at NCW at the conclusion of \nthe lawsuit. I do not think this is a common-sense interpretation of the orders granting class certification, and I shall \nnot interpret the orders in the manner suggested by defendants. I note that to interpret the orders as suggested by \ndefendants might be to permit the defendants to control who is a member of the class since defendants may well \nhave had the capacity to influence who would be paroled. Moreover, Judge Urbom denied a motion to decertify the \nclass precisely because he believed some plaintiffs would come and go at NCW during the relevant time period and \nthus a classaction suit was particularly necessary: \"Numerous inmates will have come and gone from NCW during \nthe protracted time period required to complete the trial and appeal procedures of a case like this. Accordingly, I find \nthat, as to any given plaintiff, this case is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" (Filing 45, at 1 (emphasis \nadded).) It is thus difficult to believe that Judge Urbom meant to certify the class in the limited manner suggested by \ndefendants. \n[6] It has been my understanding that the comparison institution in this case was alleged by plaintiffs to be NSP and \nnot some other institution. Interestingly, although defendants now contend that the males at NSP are not \"similarly \nsituated\" to the NCW females for comparison purposes, the defendants successfully objected to certain discovery \nregarding other institutions, contending that such discovery was irrelevant. (Filing 488, at 4.) In any event, the \ncomparison institution has been understood by the court and counsel to be NSP and not HCC, LCC or OCC. \n[7] Unlike the protracted discovery proceedings in this case, the trial was characterized by civility and good humor on \nthe part of all the lawyers. \n\n[8] During this time, Judge Urbom took senior status, but he maintained a full caseload while awaiting appointment of \nhis successor. \n[9] Therefore, this court is not confronted with the question of whether prison segregation on the basis of sex alone \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, I have no occasion to consider whether such segregation is inherently \nunequal as it would be if the classification was based upon race. See Note, Women's Prisons: An Equal Protection \nEvaluation, 94 Yale L.J. 1182, 1189 (1985) (comparing Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. \n256 (1896) with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), supplemented, 349 \nU.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955)) [hereinafter referred to as Note, Women's Prisons]. \n[10] This, of course, assumes that there are, as a matter of fact, qualitative or quantitative differences between the \nprograms at NSP and NCW such that it may be said that women suffer a substantial burden. If there is no such \nburden, then there is no factual basis for the equal protection claim, and there is no reason to apply any test. The \nquestion of \"burden\" was hotly contested. \n[11] The history of the Canterino and Glover line of cases is complex. In this opinion, I have sometimes distinguished \nthe cases by the use of Roman numerals. Canterino v. Wilson (Canterino II), 644 F.Supp. 738 (W.D.Ky.1986), dealt \nwith the Equal Protection Clause in relation to law libraries. Canterino v. Barber (Canterino III), 564 F.Supp. 711 \n(W.D.Ky.1983), dealt with the liability of a prison administrator in relation to vocational courses. For additional rulings \nby the district court, see Canterino v. Wilson, 538 F.Supp. 62 (W.D.Ky.1982) (ruling on motion to intervene), \nand Canterino v. Wilson, 562 F.Supp. 106 (W.D.Ky.1983) (ruling on motion for supplemental relief). For rulings of the \ncourt of appeals, see Canterino v. Wilson, 875 F.2d 862 (6th Cir.) (affirming Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. 738), cert. \ndenied, Wilson v. Canterino, 493 U.S. 991, 110 S.Ct. 539, 107 L.Ed.2d 536 (1989); Canterino v. Wilson, 869 F.2d \n948 (6th Cir.1989) (vacating in part Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. 174, and holding that prisoners had no liberty interest in \nrelease programs and prisoners failed to prove denial of release programs was gender based). Glover v. Johnson \n(Glover II), 510 F.Supp. 1019 (E.D.Mich.1981), aff'd sub nom. Cornish v. Johnson, 774 F.2d 1161 (6th Cir.1985), cert. \ndenied, Johnson v. Manzie, 478 U.S. 1020, 106 S.Ct. 3334, 92 L.Ed.2d 739 (1986), set forth remedies. Glover v. \nJohnson (Glover III), 855 F.2d 277 (6th Cir.1988), dealt with the propriety of injunctive and related relief and \nremanded for further findings. See Glover v. Johnson (Glover IV), 721 F.Supp. 808 (E.D.Mich.1989) (on remand \nfrom Glover III). For other rulings by the district court, see Glover v. Johnson, 85 F.R.D. 1 (E.D.Mich.1977) (dealing \nwith class certification); Glover v. Johnson, 531 F.Supp. 1036 (E.D.Mich.1982) (dealing with attorney fees); Glover v. \nJohnson, 659 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Mich. 1987) (dealing with contempt), vacated by Glover III, 855 F.2d 277; Glover v. \nJohnson, 662 F.Supp. 820 (E.D.Mich.1987) (dealing with remediation costs). For a related opinion of the court of \nappeals, see Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703 (6th Cir.1991) (affirming in part and reversing in part contempt rulings \nin Glover IV and noting that the finding of equal protection violations was the law of the case). Suffice it to say that the \nvitality of the Canterino and Glover line of cases for the propositions cited throughout this opinion remains \nunchallenged. \n[12] Judge Starr subsequently became Solicitor General of the United States. \n[13] In Pitts, the court could easily find a disparity between male and female inmates which \"substantially burdened\" \nthe females. 866 F.2d at 1453 & n. 4. The fact of \"burden\" in this case is in dispute. \n[14] The plaintiffs contend that NSP, as opposed to some other male institution, is the proper comparison against \nwhich to judge the programs at NCW. (Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 28: \"NCW/NSP Parity Analysis\".) This case has \nproceeded on that assumption. (Filing 486.) As Judge Urbom noted in January, 1991, \"[t]he plaintiffs allege that the \ndefendants have illegally discriminated against them on the basis of their gender by providing educational and \nvocational services that are inferior to those offered to male inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP) in \nLincoln.\" (Filing 409, Mem. Order Defs.' Mots. Dismiss and Summ. J. at 1.) \n[15] It should be noted that the defendants concede that \"[b]ecause treatment for serious medical needs and access \nto the courts are constitutionally required, the profile of inmates and security concerns of the institutions are \nirrelevant.\" (Defs.' Reply Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 4 (discussing the \"similarly-situated\" issue).) This concession means \nthat for Fourteenth Amendment claims regarding access to the courts and for Eighth Amendment claims regarding \nmedical treatment — rights predicated upon substantive provisions of the Constitution — an inmate need not show \nthat she is \"similarly situated\" compared to some other inmate. \n[16] The inmate-to-staff ratios for men at NSP and women at NCW are similar. (Ex. 1378.) In 1992, the inmate-to-staff \nratio for security at NSP was 3.02, and for females the ratio was 3.03. (Ex. 1378.) One might have expected more \n\nsecurity staff at an institution housing men if security concerns were greater for male institutions as compared to \nfemale institutions. \n[17] The same could be said of administrative concerns. Once again, almost any prison case will have some potential \nimpact on day-to-day prison administration. The real question is whether the court's scrutiny broadly threatens to \nmicromanage a prison. In this case, the challenged conduct, while certainly having some impact on the minutia of \ndaily prison life, is programmatic in nature. Thus, the court's \"interference\" in such programs is properly focused on \npolicy rather than administration. It is therefore unlikely that the court will involve itself in questions having to do with \nthe \"daily oversight of inmate behavior.\" Id. While the danger of such inappropriate micromanagement is ever \npresent, the court, if it is sensitive to the potential, can properly apply heightened scrutiny without presuming to run a \nprison. \n[18] For example, the policy of paying women less than men for comparable work can hardly be justified by questions \nof security. \n[19] As one commentator has cautioned, \"[b]eliefs about women's nature encourage prison officials — nearly all of \nwhom are male — to deal with women in a protective, even infantilizing manner.\" Nicole Hahn Rafter, Address, 1987 \nA.B.A. Sec. Individual Rights and Responsibilities, 14 S.P.G. Hum.Rts. 2828 (LEXIS, JLR). This is not to say, \nhowever, that women may not have strikingly different needs from men, not based entirely upon gender, when they \nare imprisoned. \n[20] The proper point to recognize the historic separation of men from women in prison in the heightened scrutiny \nanalysis is where the court determines whether the means chosen to further the state's objective are substantially \nrelated. Pitts, 866 F.2d at 1458 (\"Our inquiry into the relation between the classification under challenge and the \ngovernment interest advanced to justify it begins by noting a pervasive characteristic of American prisons, namely, \nthe separation of inmates on the basis of gender.... We therefore assume for purposes of our analysis that these \ngeneral, widespread practices in American prison systems do not run afoul of constitutional demands.\"). The question \nbecomes whether the means chosen to further the state's objective \"directly responds to and entirely correlates with \nthe more pervasive gender classification existing in both federal and state prison systems.\" Id. at 1459. Even if the \nchallenged classification is consistent with gender segregation in general, the court must then also determine whether \nthe challenged policy (not the general policy of gender segregation) reflects invidious discrimination. Id. (\"Despite the \nclassification's relation to more general differential treatment, we must also ensure that the classification does not \notherwise reflect or stem from invidious discrimination.\"). \n[21] For example, at the defendants' request I toured both NSP and NCW. \n[22] Despite enormous effort on Magistrate Judge Piester's part, the parties could not even agree what the \ncontroverted issues in this case were. The principal pretrial conference order sets forth both plaintiffs' and defendants' \ncontroverted issues, and to some extent the statements of the issues are different. The pretrial conference order thus \nruns well over 70 pages, approximately 64 of which are devoted to setting forth what the parties believed were the \ncontroverted issues. (Filing 409.) \n[23] It must be admitted that any comparison between sex-segregated prisons is difficult at best precisely because of \nthe segregation based upon gender. Note, Women's Prisons, 94 Yale L.J. at 1196-97 & nn. 75-76. Yet by limiting the \nanalysis to the program level, some of the differences which exist between prisons that house male and female \ninmates can be ignored since many of those differences simply have nothing to do with the programs under scrutiny. \n[24] Terms such as \"substantially equivalent\" or \"parity\" are vague and therefore invite inconsistent application. Note, \nWomen's Prisons, 94 Yale L.J. at 1196 & n. 72. However, if a court accepts, as the plaintiffs do and as I think \nprecedent requires, the principle that the \"strict scrutiny\" test, normally applied in cases involving race, should not be \nemployed in equal protection cases involving gender-segregated prisons, there is probably no better concept than \n\"substantially equivalent\" or \"parity.\" Id. at 1196-1198. The concept of \"parity\" is endorsed by the American \nCorrectional Association: \"Correctional systems must be guided by the principle of parity. Female offenders must \nreceive the equivalent range of services available to other offenders.\" (Ex. 292, at 28 (Public Correctional Policy on \nFemale Offender Services).) It thus has a general meaning that is not foreign to prison administrators. \n[25] Note, Women's Prisons, 94 Yale L.J. at 1183 n. 6 (citations omitted). Depending upon the time period, NSP was \napproximately 5-7 times larger in terms of population than NCW. \n\n[26] As noted earlier, security staff ratios were also similar. \n[27] Per capita spending, standing alone, can also be very misleading. Education cost data used in this case provide \na good example. The cost per inmate for Adult Basic Education or General Educational Development (ABE/GED) in \nfiscal year 91/92 was $1,050 for females and $320 for males, if one simply took the total dollar figure for those \nprograms and divided by the average number of inmates at each institution. (Ex. 1378.) But if one looked at the cost \nper inmate graduating with a GED, it cost $7,640 for females and $9,832 for males for the same period of time. These \nfigures are calculated by using relevant education costs for fiscal year 1992 for each institution. At NSP, these costs \nwere $245,800, (5266:25; 5267:1-2), and at NCW, these costs were $129,885 (5264:19-25). The number of inmates \nreceiving their diplomas during the same period of time as the cost data is then determined for each institution. At \nNCW, 17 inmates received their diplomas during the relevant time frame. (3090:5-9.) At NSP, 25 inmates received \ntheir diplomas during the same time. (3040:8-10.) The cost data for each institution are then divided by the number of \ninmates at the institution receiving diplomas. \n[28] It is worth noting that, \"[o]nly when analysis rather than habit results in the implementation of ... programs will the \nState have met this burden as well.\" Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1082 n. 5. Because the defendants have not been \nwilling to expressly articulate what they believe the important governmental objective is behind differing treatment of \nNCW inmates, judgment could be entered in favor of the plaintiffs — assuming the difference in treatment imposed a \nsubstantial burden on the plaintiffs. The defendants would have failed on the first part of the Hogan test. However, I \nshall not do so, for the reason that at least from an evidentiary point of view the defendants may have (perhaps \ninadvertently) proven a legitimate governmental objective. \n[29] There is strong disagreement about the legal relevance of this information. \n[30] For example, plaintiffs' expert Ms. Goins testified during cross-examination that males, as they come into \ncorrectional facilities, have been employed at higher-paying positions than females. The defendants cite this \ntestimony with approval, suggesting that it \"reflects a societal disparity.\" (Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 9.) Ms. Goins stated: \n\"This is a society problem as well ... [O]ur prisons mirror ... the societ[y's] problems.... [I]n general, male inmates \nwould have been employed in the community above the rate of pay that a female would have [been paid].\" (684:12-\n18.) \n[31] Once again, the defendants have not attempted to expressly articulate an important governmental objective \nbecause the defendants do not think the Hogan \"heightened scrutiny\" test is applicable. By making the assumption in \nthe text, I am being generous since the defendants have failed to prove that the legislature of the State of Nebraska \nhad such a goal in mind for treating women differently than men. Hogan, 458 U.S. at 730 n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3339 n. \n16. See Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461, 101 S.Ct. 1195, 1199, 67 L.Ed.2d 428 (1981). \n[32] NCW was familiar with and consulted ACA \"standards\" (e.g., Ex. 25, at 6). In fact, all Nebraska prisons are \naccredited by the ACA. Although the foregoing statement is not an ACA \"standard\" as such, it does apparently \nrepresent the policy of the ACA. But since the foregoing statement was not a \"standard,\" the ACA evidently did not \nhave occasion to determine whether NCW was operated in conformity with the statement. I note that there is a \ngeneral ACA standard which requires institutions housing female inmates to \"provide essential equality with male \ninstitutions.\" (Ex. 40, at 87, Standard 2-4332.) As the ACA did not specifically compare NSP with NCW for purposes \nof accreditation to determine the issue of \"equality\" pursuant to standard 2-4332, I am not persuaded that the ACA \naccreditation means very much for purposes of this case. \n[33] The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that women have suffered discrimination. Hogan, 458 U.S. at \n728, 102 S.Ct. at 3338 (citing Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 97 S.Ct. 1192, 51 L.Ed.2d 360 \n(1977), and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 95 S.Ct. 572, 42 L.Ed.2d 610 (1975)). Thus, this point is not simply \nsome popular belief about women, but a judicially recognized fact of constitutional significance. \n[34] But, if the defendants are required to justify their actions for equal protection purposes on remediation goals, they \nmay \"hang by their own rope.\" As Hogan demonstrates, the state cannot advance a remedial goal as a legitimate and \nimportant objective, and then act inconsistently with that objective. 458 U.S. at 731, 102 S.Ct. at 3340. \n[35] There are thus two components to the goal. The first component is \"rehabilitation\" and the second component is \n\"remediation.\" \"Rehabilitation\" by itself probably would not be sufficient as there is no evidence that men need \nrehabilitation either less or more than women. \n\n[36] I pause here to comment on the expert witnesses. With few exceptions, I found the expert testimony from both \nsides to be generally uninformative. More often than not, the experts seemed to concentrate on generalities \n(sometimes providing homilies) rather than specifics. Perhaps the experts simply did not have a good grasp of the \nfacts. In any event, I do not mention this point to criticize capable counsel. Rather, I make this point as a fact finder \nwho found it annoying to have to sort out and understand a complex fact pattern with little help from the experts on \nthe specifics. I also make this point for such other judges as may review this opinion. I generally found the experts to \nbe lacking in credibility; consequently, sparse mention is made of the experts in this opinion. \n[37] The plaintiffs point to other opportunities available to male inmates at the Hastings Correctional Center (HCC). I \ndo not think the state-paid work assignment opportunities available to the male inmates at HCC are directly relevant \nsince the comparison institution is NSP. \n[38] \"Substantially\" is a relative term. To inmates with a limited opportunity to earn money, and then only at a nominal \nrate in most cases, a difference of a few dollars per month is meaningful. \n[39] For the same reason one could also conclude that the means adopted to further the goal were not directly and \nsubstantially related to the goal because the goal — payment on a hourly basis — could be accomplished without \ngender classification. \n[40] This point stands for the unremarkable proposition that if the challenged policy is a direct product of otherwise \nvalidly segregated prisons, one has less reason to be skeptical about the relationship between the means chosen to \nimplement the legitimate governmental objective. Location was the issue in Pitts, and by definition, prisons for \nfemales will always be located at different places than prisons for males. \n[41] The policy of segregating women from men in prison is thought to be founded upon four objectives: avoidance of \nthe cost of co-correctional facilities, provision for the special needs of women in prison (for example, maternity), \nprotection of the privacy rights of incarcerated women, and preservation of prison security. Note, Women's Prisons, \n94 Yale L.J. at 1198-1204. As noted earlier, cost is not a justification for unequal treatment. \n[42] All members of the class who were employed at NCW during the time frame covered by the disputed pay policy \nwould have been damaged by the policy. For the testimony of one or more inmates who testified that they were \nspecifically harmed, examine the testimony of Linda Lange. \n[43] Both institutions offer and offered so-called basic education programs such as Adult Basic Education (ABE) and \nGeneral Educational Development (GED), and plaintiffs do not challenge these programs. \n[44] It is interesting to note that this statistic is based upon \"missing\" data. For example, this statistic is based upon \nmissing data for \"149\" maximum custody inmates. (Ex. 448, Education at Admission, under \"Frequency.\") The total \npotential sample size for this statistic was 538 inmates in current custody at the maximum security unit. (Ex. 448, \ncompare total number under \"frequency\" (538) in Table \"current custody\" (maximum security) with total number under \n\"frequency\" (538) in Table \"education at admission\" (maximum security).) This means that out of a potential sample \nsize of 538 inmates, NSP lacked educational data for 28 percent of the maximum security inmates. A similar problem \nexists for medium security inmates where the total inmates in \"custody\" were 185, but NSP was \"missing\" data for 63 \ninmates for purposes of calculation of \"education at admission.\" (Ex. 448, compare total number under \"frequency\" \n(185) in Table \"admission type\" (medium security) with total number under \"frequency\" (185) in Table \"education at \nadmission\" (medium security).) NSP was missing educational data for about 34 percent of its medium custody \ninmates. With NSP missing educational data for well over 25 percent of the male inmates, it is difficult to give the \n\"60%\" figure relied upon by the defendants much credence. \n[45] It should also be emphasized that Dr. Ryan found in 1989 that at OCC 18 on-site college courses, (Ex. 34, at 52), \nwere offered to male inmates whose level of educational attainment was similar to the women. (Ex. 34, at 52.) \n[46] As I observed earlier, the same is true for levels of educational attainment where the OCC inmates and NCW \ninmates were found by Ryan to be similar, (Ex. 34, at 52), but OCC offered a substantial number of college courses \nto males. \n\n[47] Here it is appropriate to look at data from OCC, not because OCC was necessarily similar to NCW or NSP, but \nbecause it provides an opportunity to examine whether the \"length-of-stay\" data impacts male institutions where the \nlength of stay is relatively short. \n[48] Horticulture was offered at NCW for about a year in 1990 and 1991, but was terminated when budget cuts were \nimplemented, as will be discussed in a moment. In any event, when horticulture was offered, thereby providing the \nfemale inmates with a nonstereotypical additional vocational training option, the program was very well received. \nDuring the time horticulture was offered, the inmates did have two options for vocational education, but still would \nhave been burdened by the inability to receive college, credit or a degree in either vocational program. \n[49] There is no dispute about the fact that these programs were \"prevocational\"; in fact, that was the nomenclature \nused by the defendants. (Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 31 (\"The pre-vocational programs, MOLD and Living Skills, help \ninmates develop parenting skills and home economics skills.\").) \n[50] For example, no one would could reasonably contend that providing males with a course on anger control would \namount to providing them with vocational training, although anger control might otherwise be needed by males to \npursue a vocation. \n[51] Thirty percent of 560 inmates is 168 inmates. (560 - 168 7e 392.) Forty inmates in vocational programs divided \nby 392 potentially interested inmates yields a figure of about 10.2 percent. Thus, the exclusion causes the percentage \nof male inmates using vocational programs to rise from about 7 percent to 10.2 percent, or an increase of 45.7 \npercent. \n[52] Dr. Ryan did not count state-paid work assignments. \n[53] I do not understand the plaintiffs to argue that, as compared to the men, fewer jobs relatively speaking are \nprovided to the females by CSI. Indeed, about 35 NCW inmates have CSI jobs and about 108 NSP inmates have CSI \njobs. Given the fact that NSP is anywhere from 5 to 7 times larger than NCW in terms of inmate population, there is \nrough parity in the sheer numbers of jobs provided by CSI. \n[54] For example, there was a fair amount of testimony that the data-entry job involved only \"inputting\" such things as \nnames into a computer, and, therefore, the inmates did not learn much. On the other hand, there was very little \nevidence about whether the jobs for the males were much better. \n[55] Defendants complain that prerelease as such was not a matter controverted in the pretrial conference order and, \naccordingly, argue that I should not consider plaintiffs' claim. In my view, prerelease is a part of the academic and \nvocational policies challenged by the plaintiffs and is thus fairly raised by the order. Even if it were not, I would grant \nleave to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 as it is clear that the defendants were not surprised by the issue. \n[56] There are repeated references in the briefs to various administrative excuses for the comparative inequality, such \nas cost. But, as noted previously, these excuses do not constitute an important governmental objective. \n[57] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by the challenged policies, see generally the \ntestimony of Lange, Nancy Brown (Cortes), Vrtatko, Anthony, Rebecca Brown, Neely, Griffin, and Danekas. \n[58] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by the challenged policies see generally the \ntestimony of Klinger, Nancy Brown (Cortes), Vrtatko, Younger, Anderson, Danekas, Williamson, Anderson, Rebecca \nBrown, Batiste, Neely, Griffin, Danekas, and Smith. \n[59] The inmates also have a separate claim that, notwithstanding the claimed equal protection violation, they have \nbeen denied their constitutional right of access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bounds v. \nSmith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). Thus, the women argue that even if there was \nno equal protection violation, they have proven a constitutional violation in that they did not have meaningful access \nto the courts. See, e.g., Glover I, 478 F.Supp. at 1096-97 (the fact that the law library at the men's institution was \nlarger than the law library for the women did not establish an equal protection violation so long as the library for the \nwomen was adequate, but the women were nevertheless denied their right of access to the courts because an \nadequate library cannot provide meaningful access to the courts to a prisoner untrained in basic legal research \n\ntechniques). For the sake of clarity, I shall review these claims — equal protection and access to the courts — \nseparately. \n[60] This segregation was normally for disciplinary reasons. \n[61] As discussed in more detail later, NCW inmates in orientation were under a \"quarantine.\" \n[62] In 1977, the Supreme Court observed that Shepard's Citations is part of a minimum collection list for prisons \napproved by the American Correctional Association, American Bar Association, and the American Association of Law \nLibraries, although the Court did not find that the failure to include Shepard's Citations amounted to a constitutional \ndeprivation. Bounds, 430 U.S. at 819-20 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. at 1493-94 n. 4. \n[63] In this connection, the NSP men had at least four trained inmate legal aides, but the NCW women had only one \ninmate legal aide. In fact, the women had no legal aides until about January, 1989. The NSP law library also had a \nfull-time law librarian, whereas the NCW law library did not. \n[64] The defendants also seem to argue mootness as a result of the fact that the NCW library now has Shepard's \nCitations. Their argument in this regard is cursory. In any event, it seems to me that the present availability of a \ncitation system may effect the appropriate remedy, but it certainly does not mean that the past equal protection \nviolation may be disregarded. Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 713 (denying mootness defense). This is particularly true \nwhere, as in this class-action suit, the liability phase of trial has been bifurcated from the remedial stage of trial. \n[65] For example, the complex history of the Canterino and Glover cases would have been difficult to research by \nmail. \n[66] The extra-time policy appears to have resulted because \"[a]s of this present time there is no activities coordinator \nand Miss [Axdahl] has been working activities.\" (2104:25-2105:2.) Since Ms. Axdahl was in the area for activities, \nwhich is also near the law library, she was able in her administrative capacity to authorize a request for additional \ntime. \n[67] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by these policies, see generally the testimony \nof Klinger, Younger, Lange, Anderson, Wilson, and Neely. \n[68] The women also raise an Eighth Amendment challenge which will be considered separately. \n[69] The female inmates also complain about the medication procedures, used by NCW upon intake into the facility. \nSpecifically, they complain that the nurses fail to check with the doctor who issued the prescription as to the need for \nthe medication. Suffice it to say that for equal protection purposes the nurses' conduct at NCW — examining the \nprescription and then consulting, if necessary, with the NCW doctor — is not subject to attack for the reason that the \nevidence fails to reveal a substantial difference in treatment at NSP. This is not to condone, however, a nurse making \na medical decision without consultation with a doctor. Such a practice could implicate the Eighth Amendment. \n[70] Under Nebraska law, a physician's assistant is a specially trained person who, although not a doctor, is \nauthorized to \"perform medical services when he or she renders such services under the supervision of a licensed \nphysician.\" Neb. Rev.Stat. § 71-1,107.17 (Reissue 1990). The doctor need not be personally present at all times to \nsupervise the assistant. Id. \n[71] The lieutenant had reason for concern. Page 1745 of the Physicians' Desk Reference (1993 ed.) states that \nBenadryl may be used for \"anaphylactic reactions adjunctive to epinephrine and other standard measures after the \nacute manifestations have been controlled.\" (Emphasis in original.) \n[72] The evidence revealed that prison inmates as a class have poor dental health. Indeed, in a budget request DCS \nnoted: \"Inmates coming into Corrections generally have dental problems that far exceed those of the general \npopulation.\" (Ex. 1305, at 12.) \n\n[73] This crude statistical review does not prove the existence of a backlog or comparatively inferior dental care. As \nnoted previously, ratios of this kind can be quite misleading. However, in this instance, where a backlog was \nadmitted, this type of analysis is helpful in understanding why the backlog existed. \n[74] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by these policies, see generally the testimony \nof Griffin and Williamson. \n[75] Judge Urbom granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment claim regarding \nmental health services. (Filing 487.) Moreover, I believe that Judith Danielson, a psychologist at NCW, is no longer a \ndefendant in this case by virtue of Judge Urbom's granting of the motion for summary judgment since she appears to \nhave been named as a defendant regarding only the Eighth Amendment claims. I therefore find and conclude that \nJudith Danielson is no longer a defendant. \n[76] In this context, \"inpatient\" refers to a mental health or counseling program that provides treatment at the prison in \na closed environment and is somewhat similar to \"inpatient\" treatment at a hospital. \n[77] Danielson appeared to be uninformed and quite uninterested when she gave her testimony. \n[78] As I understand the differences in management style, under a case management system the inmate is primarily \nsupervised by a case manager, whereas under a unit management system the inmate is supervised by staff assigned \nto the living unit where the inmate resides. \n[79] Danielson was not involved in providing this counseling. \n[80] It is important to realize that 60% to 80% of the women inmates at NCW reported having been the victims of \nsexual or physical abuse, or both. Moreover, the evidence makes clear that female inmates especially need mental \nhealth services because of the psychological profiles of inmates at NCW. \n[81] Individual and group therapy is generally available without waiting lists at the present time. In addition to the \nprograms for substance abuse discussed previously, specific group therapy sessions now available include \"basic \ngroup\" (an introduction to the concept of criminal thinking), \"personality group\" (for those who have completed the \nbasic group), \"assertiveness training,\" and \"domestic violence.\" \n[82] Danielson was apparently \"supervised\" by a contract psychiatrist until Dr. Bohn, a DCS employee, assumed \nclinical supervisory responsibility over her in July, 1990. Danielson testified that she never submitted any periodic \nreports to the psychiatrist, and prior to clinical supervision by Dr. Bohn, Danielson reported to the assistant \nsuperintendent of NCW, who was also not licensed or certified. The supervising psychiatrist came to NCW once \nevery other week for a morning. It is interesting to note that the July 1, 1987, Operational Memorandum for NCW, \ndescribing the mental health programs at NCW, states that services \"are provided by qualified mental health \nprofessionals who are fully licensed in their respective disciplines.\" (Ex. 124, at 1 (emphasis added).) Danielson, \ntogether with Superintendent Lofgreen, appears to have authored the memorandum. (Id. at 9.) Danielson was not \nrequired by Nebraska law to be licensed as a psychologist because she worked for the state, Neb.Rev.Stat. § 71-\n1,207(2) (Reissue 1990), but she clearly was not \"fully licensed in [her] respective discipline\" either. \n[83] In 1989, per capita costs were about $286 at NSP and $345 at NCW, and in 1990, about $287 at NSP and $322 \nat NCW. \n[84] Although Dr. Bohn testified that no NSP inmates had received inpatient substance abuse treatment, she \nacknowledged that inmates at NSP were eligible for such treatment. In any event, it appears that Dr. Bohn was \nwrong. For example, in a memo she wrote in April, 1991, Dr. Bohn noted that two inmates were discharged to NSP \nafter receiving substance abuse treatment. (Ex. 1321, at 3.) \n[85] The women are generally transferred to the Hastings Regional Center (HRC), a state mental hospital \napproximately 60 miles west of NCW. The Hastings Regional Center is not operated by DCS. \n[86] In fact, NCW women are not transferred to HRC for substance abuse problems. NCW women simply have no \nopportunity for inpatient treatment of severe drug abuse problems. \n\n[87] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by these policies, see generally the testimony \nof Klinger, Vrtatko, Smith, Blank, Rebecca Brown, and Anderson. \n[88] It is clear that much of the disparity at NCW results from the failure to consistently employ a recreation \ncoordinator. Indeed, from January, 1988, until the time of trial in 1992, NCW was without an activities coordinator for \nabout 12 months. During this same period of time, NCW has had 4 different activities coordinators. \n[89] For example, as noted earlier, even the \"idleness\" data presented by the defendants showed that about 40% of \nthe NSP men were not idle. At any time during this litigation, 40% of the men at NSP would amount to more people in \nabsolute numbers than were imprisoned at NCW at any similar time. \n[90] For a time, NCW had no art room, but this was at a time when there was no activities coordinator. Any disparity \nin activities regarding art came about as a result of the failure to have an activities coordinator as opposed to the lack \nof plant and equipment. \n[91] It is not at all clear what recreation privileges the males actually have during orientation. \n[92] In their brief, the NCW inmates suggest a violation of the Eighth Amendment, although they acknowledge that no \nsuch violation was alleged in the complaint. Since no such violation was alleged in the complaint, and since no such \nviolation was set forth in the pretrial conference orders, and since I think the defendants would be unfairly surprised, I \ndecline to consider such allegations. \n[93] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by these policies, see generally the testimony \nof Lange, Batiste, and Danekas. \n[94] While not all inmates at NCW are mothers of minor children, a significant (although unquantified) percentage of \nthe inmates are mothers of minor children. \n[95] This policy and the related MOLD program have been recognized nationally. The NCW administration is justly \nproud of this recognition. \n[96] Although there is a dispute about when the policy actually changed, I was persuaded by the testimony of Ms. \nLohmeir, the supervisor who was responsible for staffing, that the change occurred during this time frame. \n[97] The inmates did, however, have mail privileges. \n[98] The \"quarantine\" policy is roughly like excluding visitors from seeing a hospital patient soon after surgery. \n[99] Even if not overtly intended as a cover, the policy could be based upon the archaic notion that women, due to \ntheir nature, are required to be treated in a paternalistic fashion and \"eased\" into prison, while men do not require \nsuch treatment. Whether overtly intended as a pretext or \"merely\" based upon archaic notions of gender, the policy \nwould fail. \n[100] Title IX is enforceable by persons impacted by the discrimination even though the statute may not explicitly \nauthorize such a suit. Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \n[101] Perkins Act money was administered by the Nebraska Department of Education (NDE), but as the grant \napproval letter of April 17, 1989, states, it was federal, not state, money that was being distributed: \"Your participation \nin the distribution process for federal Vocational Education funds is appreciated.\" (Ex. 81A, Letter of 4/17/89.) Indeed, \nthe application was on Perkins Act forms and explicitly requested \"federal funds\" under the Perkins Act. (Ex. 81A.) \n[102] It is not entirely clear how long Perkins Act monies were received and used for prerelease programs. In August, \n1992, one witness, an assistant director at DCS, testified that Perkins Act money was first used for prerelease \nprograms \"[a]pproximately four or five years ago.\" (1563:8.) The fiscal year ending in July, 1992, was the \"first \ncomplete year\" that Perkins Act money was not used for prerelease programs, but was entirely used for juvenile \nprograms. (1569:13-1570:4.) It thus appears that from at least 1988 through at least July, 1991, Perkins Act monies \nwere used in the prerelease programs. \n\n[103] Plaintiffs briefly argue that they have also proven that other federal funds were received in relation to other \nprograms for which an equal protection violation has been proved. While I think that may be true as a general matter, \nthe briefing is too sketchy for me to understand the ramifications of such a finding. Accordingly, I decline, at this point, \nto pass on these other arguments. \n[104] For example, inmate Danekas testified that she was paroled in May, 1991, without benefit of prerelease \ncounseling. She testified that her adjustment was difficult because \"all of a sudden you're on the other side\" and \n\"there is a whole lot of changes that you go through.\" (1178:12-16.) She ultimately returned to NCW. \n[105] July 1, 1991, appears to have been the last day Perkins Act monies were used for prerelease programs at any \ninstitution under DCS control. To the extent that DCS received Perkins Act monies thereafter (such as for use in the \njuvenile programs), defendants may be liable for the continuing discrimination in the prerelease programs (and \nperhaps others) despite the fact that the federal money was used for other purposes by DCS. See 20 U.S.C. § 1687 \n(definition of \"program or activity\"). I need not reach that issue now. \n[106] Defendants raise other arguments which warrant no discussion as they have essentially been dealt with in Part \nII of this opinion. To the extent the defendants believe that the § 1983 claims are \"subsumed\" in the Title IX claim, \nthat argument is premature and should be considered, if at all, during the remedy phase of this litigation. \n[107] The Canterino III court emphasized that the proof, as against one defendant, showed the defendant had given \nexplicit assurances of compliance with Title IX. Id. at 715. Such is also the case here with Gunter. \n[108] As I later find that plaintiffs have proven intentional discrimination, the significance of this finding may not be \ngreat. \n[109] As the Court noted, the \"analysis of Title IX and Title VI ... has developed along similar lines.\" Id. ___ U.S. at \n___, 112 S.Ct. at 1032. \n[110] Because of this finding, I need not, and do not, decide whether intentional discrimination must be shown where \nit is claimed that the Title IX regulations (see, e.g., 34 C.F.R. 106.1-106.71 (1989)) have been violated. \n[111] This is the equivalent of finding that the women were \"substantially burdened\" by the disparity in the programs. \n[112] The Eleventh Amendment immunity of the State of Nebraska was abrogated regarding the Title IX violation by \nthe Civil Rights Remedies Equalization Amendment of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. \nSchs., ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 1036 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(2)). This amendment was, by its terms, \neffective with \"respect to violations that occur in whole or in part after October 21, 1986.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(b). \nThus, I find and conclude that defendant DCS is liable for paying any judgment regarding the violation of Title IX. \n[113] The NCW inmates do not claim that the number of hours the library is open violates their Fourteenth \nAmendment right of access to the courts. They do, however, contend that the fact that the scheduled law library \nhours at NCW are less than 1/3 of the scheduled hours available to the men at NSP violates the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As noted earlier, I agree. Moreover, these positions are not inconsistent. For \npurposes of the access-to-the-courts claim, the question is whether the female inmates have meaningful access to \nthe courts, taking into consideration a variety of factors including, but not limited to, library facilities. For equal \nprotection purposes, the question is whether women, because they are women, should labor with less than 1/3 of the \nscheduled law library hours made available to men. In Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. at 738, Chief Judge Johnstone was \nconfronted with the State of Kentucky's motion to alter his previous orders. He had previously ordered Kentucky to \nprovide female inmates with law library facilities equivalent to the men, to expand the time the library was open, and \nto provide legal assistance to the inmates in areas of demonstrated need. Kentucky argued that it had complied \nwith Bounds and such compliance was all that was required. Judge Johnstone denied the motion, reminding \nKentucky that: \"this court relied, not only on Bounds, but on the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection \nguarantee.\" Id. at 740-41. The decision was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Canterino v. Wilson, 875 \nF.2d 862. \n[114] Soon after inmate Lange was appointed a legal aide in January, 1989, she began to organize the contents of \nthe library. \n\n[115] As Judges Urbom and Piester observed, no showing of actual prejudice is required where the inmate \nestablishes that the system of providing access to the courts is not in compliance with Bounds. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. \nat 1129. \n[116] The testimony indicated that Linda Lange took her training sometime in August, 1988, but it was not until \nsometime in January, 1989, that she was appointed a legal aide. Lange apparently sometimes acted informally as a \nlegal aide from August, 1988, until January, 1989, if an NCW staff person transmitted a request for assistance to her. \nLange did not begin to give orientation programs to the inmates on the law library until the \"first month\" of her \nappointment. (2731:6-9.) Without her formal designation as a legal aide, it is doubtful that other inmates knew they \ncould ask Lange for assistance. Moreover, in early August, 1988, Lange tried to give legal assistance to an inmate in \nthe \"hole,\" but was denied permission. (Ex. 80.) Still further, since Lange was not paid as an aide and would have \nhad to conduct her legal aide work in addition to her normal job responsibilities, her informal service was no \nsubstitute. \n[117] For the testimony of one or more inmates who have been harmed by these policies, see generally the testimony \nof Klinger, Younger, and Lange. The defendants object to the testimony of Younger to the extent that it relates to \nincidents which took place prior to January 1, 1988, the date established by the court as the beginning date for class \ncertification. In my view, January 1, 1988, established the beginning date for class certification, but it did not limit the \npresentation of relevant evidence regarding incidents which took place within the applicable statute of limitations \nperiod. Whether damages may be awarded to class members for incidents which took place earlier than January 1, \n1988, is a matter I shall defer until the remedy stage of this trial. \n[118] This training is also available to any inmate who wants to take the course even though she might not want to be \nan inmate legal aide. \n[119] Inmate Lange and Ms. Axdahl \"attended a quarter class at the penitentiary from [SECC] in legal research.\" \n(3114:4-8.) \n[120] The NCW inmates are, for example, quite concerned with the lack of Shepard's Citations during certain times. \nThe Supreme Court recognized in a footnote that Shepard's Citations was included in a minimum collection list for \nprison law libraries. Bounds, 430 U.S. at 819-20 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. at 1493-94 n. 4. Although the Court considered the \nfailure to include Shepard's Citations in the collection list a \"questionable omission,\" the Court apparently concluded \nthat such an omission did not establish a violation of the right of access to the courts. Since Bounds, the courts have \ngenerally found the failure to include Shepard's Citations in a prison law library to be a questionable, but not fatal, \nomission. See, e.g., White v. Batson, 907 F.2d 156 (9th Cir.1990) (Table, Text in Westlaw, No. 89-15689); Lindquist \nv. Idaho State Bd. of Corrections, 776 F.2d 851, 856 (9th Cir.1985). \n[121] The course appears to have been taught by instructors from the University of Nebraska College of Law library, \nand included about 30 hours of in-class work. (Ex. 50, Course Syllabus.) If the syllabus was followed, Lange would \nhave completed her training on August 15, 1988. The course was broad in scope and covered a wide variety of \nmatters. It appears to have been well designed to meet the needs of inmate legal aides. \n[122] For the testimony of an inmate who was harmed by this policy, see the testimony of Lange, particularly \nregarding her difficulty in preparing the grievance that led to this lawsuit. \n[123] Even though Bounds clearly does not require NCW to provide both an adequate law library and trained legal \naides, the combination of the equal protection violations that I have heretofore found, coupled with the violation \nof Bounds until January, 1989, may justify a remedy greatly exceeding the minimum requirements \nof Bounds. Canterino II, 644 F.Supp. at 740-41. I shall leave this question for resolution during the remedy stage of \nthe trial of this case. \n[124] These incidents are discussed in more detail in the preceding portion of this memorandum dealing with \nplaintiffs' equal protection claims, and I shall not restate these incidents in any detail here. In any event, I find that \neach of these three incidents satisfies the so-called \"objective\" component of an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel \nand unusual punishment; that is, each incident was sufficiently \"serious\" so as to implicate the Eighth \nAmendment. Hudson v. McMillian, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 995, 1000, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (explaining the \n\"objective\" component of Eighth Amendment claims). \n\n[125] As Judge Urbom found when he partially granted a motion for summary judgment in this case, the defendants \nwho are sued in their official capacity alone cannot have liability to respond in damages for the constitutional \nviolations because that would be the equivalent of suing the state in violation of the Eleventh Amendment. (Filings \n486 at 3 & 487, ¶ 3(a), (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102, 104 S.Ct. 900, 909, \n79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984)).) But such officials may be enjoined to prevent a violation of federal law even though such \nrelief may have a profound impact upon the state treasury. Nix v. Norman, 879 F.2d 429, 432 (8th \nCir.1989) (citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667-68, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1357-58, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974)). \nFurthermore, to the extent the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity has been abrogated regarding the Title IX \nclaim, there would appear to be no constitutional impediment to imposing any type of relief on a defendant sued in his \nor her official capacity for a violation of Title IX. \n[126] Tewes also was an assistant director at DCS before and after his tenure at NCW. I conclude that Tewes was \nsued only in his individual capacity because the third amended complaint discussed his conduct in relationship to his \ntenure at NCW. (Filing 333, ¶ 22.) \n[127] These same concepts would seem to apply to individual defendants charged with violating Title IX. Canterino \nIII, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15 (imposing liability on individual defendant for violations of the Equal Protection Clause and \nTitle IX). \n[128] As noted previously, since Clarke is sued in his official capacity, he cannot have liability to respond in damages \nexcept to the extent that the Eleventh Amendment immunity has been abrogated for violation of the Title IX claim. \n[129] Title IX violations regarding discrimination in educational matters are, of course, very similar in nature to the \nequal protection violations regarding educational matters. Canterino I, 546 F.Supp. at 210. \n[130] Lofgreen knew of the activity of these inmates because a guard had evidently been handed the inmate \ngrievance that was being circulated among the prisoners, and the guard had consulted Lofgreen. Although it is not \nentirely clear what actually happened, it is probable that the guard had been asked to assist in the circulation of the \ngrievance. \n[131] This included defendant Harold Clarke, who was then warden at NSP. \n[132] Although it is not entirely clear who made up this \"committee,\" it apparently included the heads of the adult \ninstitutions and the central office staff who were present on March 25, 1988: Gunter, deputy director Falconer, \nassistant director Grammer, personnel director Burger, and general counsel Camp. (Ex. 37.) Gunter testified his \nintention was that \"this committee of people which included CEO's, central office staff would be a group of people that \nwould determine consistency in the operations so that I didn't want a person to be the person to say you can make an \nexception to this policy. I wanted it to be a group ... [decision].\" (4537:22-4538:2.) \n[133] The letter was ultimately signed by an assistant director for Gunter, and Gunter acknowledged that the letter \nwas sent at his direction. Although it is difficult to read the date on \"Part B\" of the response to the grievance, it \nappears that Gunter's response was actually given on March 28, 1988. (Ex. 10.) \n[134] The letter concluded by adding: \"I have appointed a task force to monitor policies and procedures of this \nDepartment's adult institutions to help ensure that there is a reasonable basis for any inconsistencies in the policies \nand procedures enforced in those facilities.\" (Id. at 6.) \n[135] The evidence reflected that the Ryan study was not initiated as a result of the complaints by the NCW inmates, \nbut rather was a system-wide study. \n[136] Clarke clearly knew of the NCW grievance as he was at the March 25, 1988, meeting and was, if one believes \nGunter, appointed to the \"task force.\" \n[137] In cases where the defendant is not the person or entity who actually committed the unconstitutional act, the \nultimate concern of the lower federal courts is to comply with the Supreme Court's mandate in Rizzo v. Goode — that \nbefore liability is imposed a link must be established between the unlawful act and authorization or approval of the act \nby an otherwise passive defendant. The Jane Doe A approach is sensitive to the concerns of the Supreme Court \nin Rizzo. See also City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). \n\n[138] As previously discussed, I doubt that plaintiffs are obligated to prove discriminatory intent regarding the equal \nprotection violations or to obtain injunctive relief under Title IX inasmuch as the classification in this case is explicitly \nbased upon gender. Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15 (citing Hogan and holding that discriminatory intent need \nnot be proven in order to hold prison administrator liable under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX inasmuch as \n\"[d]efendants enforce a gender-based policy classifying all women prisoners to KCIW [the women's prison] where \nthey are offered inferior vocational programs.\"). It is likely that plaintiffs must show intentional discrimination to \nrecover damages for a proven violation of Title IX. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. \nat 1035; Beehler v. Jeffes, 664 F.Supp. at 940. If discriminatory intent is an element of liability, as noted earlier, I am \npersuaded that the findings I have made under the Hogan and Pitts heightened scrutiny test, coupled with the finding \nof deliberate indifference, are the equivalent of a finding of discriminatory intent. \n[139] In fact, with the exception of a brief discussion of the defense of qualified immunity, the defendants' posttrial \nbriefs are curiously silent on the question of the liability of the individual defendants. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, \ndevoted 45 pages of their first posttrial brief to this question. (Pls.' Post-Trial Br. at 124-169.) \n[140] DCS made the assignments of doctors, dentists, and nurses at NCW. For example, it was a DCS staff person \n(Whitson) who ultimately decided that nursing coverage would not be provided at NCW 24 hours a day. \n[141] This fact distinguishes Santiago v. Miles, 774 F.Supp. at 790-91. In that case, the prison wardens were held to \nhave known about race discrimination among prisoners in one institution. It is a very different matter to charge a \nsuperintendent of one prison housing females with knowledge about another prison housing males. \n[142] This is obviously not to say that the NCW superintendents were entirely ignorant of the policies and programs at \nthe male institutions. For example, Wayne had worked at NSP for a substantial period of time; Tewes worked at the \nDCS central office before going to NCW; and Lofgreen acquired knowledge about other institutions when he dealt \nwith specific inmate grievances. (See, e.g., Ex. 47.) However, if the parity issue was to be dealt with seriously, the \nfarreaching question required detailed knowledge of all the challenged programs and policies at all the DCS \ninstitutions. This is clearly why Lofgreen refused to deal with the \"parity\" grievance and instead referred it to the \nperson who had the responsibility to possess such knowledge — the director of DCS. \n[143] These factors distinguish Canterino III, 564 F.Supp. at 714-15. In that case, Superintendent Barber was held \nliable because he played a \"direct role in the provision of the vocational education programs for both men and \nwomen,\" and he gave express assurances of compliance with Title IX. Id. at 714 (emphasis added). In this case, \nGunter gave the express assurances of compliance with Title IX, (Ex. 81A), the NCW superintendents had no \nresponsibility for programming at NSP, and, at Gunter's direction, no one person was to deal with \"consistency\" \nissues. \n[144] This does not mean Gunter would escape liability for an equal protection violation that also constituted an \naccess-to-the-courts violation. Take, for example, the inadequacy of the law library. Gunter is liable for the equal \nprotection violation because the NCW law library was poor when compared to the NSP law library. The issue of \n\"parity\" was Gunter's responsibility. He had specific notice of the claim of inequality and did nothing of substance to \ndeal with it. It is not inconsistent to also conclude that Gunter escapes liability because the law library did not comply \nwith Bounds, inasmuch as compliance with Bounds was the responsibility of the individual wardens and Gunter was \nnot notified of the noncompliance with Bounds. Obviously, there can be more than one proximate cause of injury or \ndamage and different liability theories for each proximate cause. \n[145] Judge Piester issued a report and recommendation holding Dahm liable in the Reutcke case on January 13, \n1988. (Ex. 1379.) \n[146] This was the same meeting where Lofgreen gave notice about the activities of the NCW inmates respecting the \ngrievance. \n[147] Moreover, Wayne's conclusion that the law library needed to be moved is strong corroboration of the inmate \ntestimony about the inadequacy of the library until it was moved. \n[148] Younger indicated her reason for being in segregation was that \"the center believed I had been hurt by another \ninmate.\" (5463:13-14.) \n\n[149] This policy also violated Bounds for the reason that \"`[i]t is unrealistic to expect a prisoner to know in advance \nexactly what materials he needs to consult.'\" Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1130 (quoting Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d \n1080, 1110 (9th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1069, 107 S.Ct. 2462, 95 L.Ed.2d 871 (1987) and Williams v. \nLeeke, 584 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 2825, 61 L.Ed.2d 276 (1979)). \n[150] The foregoing is a summary and is not necessarily intended as a complete restatement of each finding of fact \nand conclusion of law. \n ",

Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Servs., 824 F.Supp. \n1374, 1434-1438, 1449-52, 1464-65, 1468 (D.Neb.1993) (Klinger I), rev'd on equal \nprotection grounds, 31 F.3d 727 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1177, \n130 L.Ed.2d 1130 (1995) (Klinger II).[2] \nI now issue my findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 52(a) on the issue of damages. In addition, I shall enter an order scheduling the \nfiling of an application for attorney fees and a response thereto. \n I. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law[3] \n1039*1039\nPrior Liability Determination \n1. To summarize and restate, in Klinger I I decided the following as to liability on the access-\nto-the-courts claim: \nA. In 1977, the Supreme Court in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, \n52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (footnote omitted) held that \"`the fundamental constitutional right of \naccess to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and \nfiling of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or \n\nadequate assistance from persons trained in the law.'\" Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at \n1464 (Finding and Conclusion (F & C) 144). \nB. In January and June, 1988, Magistrate Judge Piester and Judge Urbom found in Reutcke \nv. Dahm, 707 F.Supp. 1121, 1132 (D.Neb.1988) that \"`[t]he simple fact is that if the state \ndenies a prisoner direct physical access to a law library, the state must provide that \nprisoner, no matter what his status, with assistance by trained, skilled, and independent \nlegal personnel.'\" Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1464 (F & C 145). \nC. It was not until sometime in January, 1989, that a trained inmate legal aide was \nappointed to assist NCW inmates. Id. (F & C 147). \nD. The orientation and segregation inmates at NCW had no physical access to the law \nlibrary until November, 1989. (Id.) (F & C 148). \nE. A violation of Bounds had been established regarding the inmates who were in \nsegregation or orientation at NCW until January, 1989, since these inmates had no physical \naccess to the law library or the assistance of a trained legal aide. The Bounds violation \nended in January of 1989 when a trained and independent inmate legal aid was \nappointed. Id. (F & C 149). \nF. Prior to January, 1989, Plaintiffs had proven a violation of Bounds regarding general \npopulation inmates because: (a) no trained and independent inmate legal aide had been \nappointed; and (b) the law library was not adequate in that one had to \"stand in the aisle\" \nbecause the only table was a small typewriter stand, and the legal materials were not \norganized but \"just were kind of piled all over.\" As to general population inmates, this \nviolation ended in January of 1989 when a trained and independent inmate legal aid was \nappointed. Id. at 1465 (F & C 153). \nG. Since it was their policies which ran afoul of Bounds, Lofgreen and Tewes (former \nsuperintendents at NCW) are liable for the access-to-the-courts violations. Klinger I, 824 \nF.Supp. at 1468 (citing Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1134) (F & C 194). \nH. The physical condition of the law library was the \"policy\" of the superintendents. This is \nevident from the small size of NCW and the fact that Wayne (a superintendent of NCW who \nfollowed Tewes and Lofgreen) recognized that he was dealing with \"policy\" when he moved \nthe library upon becoming superintendent so \"it would be easier to find volumes and \nreference material they were seeking.\" Id. (F & C 195). \nI. The restrictions on segregation and orientation inmates' physical access to the law library \nwas a \"policy\" of the superintendents; for example, inmate Younger testified that Lofgreen \npersonally denied her access to the law library when she was in segregation and Tewes \napproved a policy of denying physical access to the law library when he authorized \nsegregation inmates to have law books in segregation (a policy which also \nviolated Bounds, according to Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1130). Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at \n1468 (F & C 196). \nJ. Lofgreen and Tewes knew there were no trained inmate legal aides, and they knew the \ninmates claimed to need help, as evidenced by (a) the Lange grievance to Lofgreen in \nJune, 1988, (b) the Lange communication form regarding 1040*1040 writing to the NSP legal \naide answered by Tewes in August, 1988, and (c) the Lange correspondence about \nassisting an inmate in segregation answered by Tewes in August, 1988. Id. (F & C 197). \nK. Under Bounds and Reutcke, the claims regarding access to the courts involved well-\nestablished areas of the law, and therefore defendants Lofgreen and Tewes were not \nentitled to qualified immunity. Id. at 1469 (F & C 203). \nMotion for Reconsideration \n\n2. On March 20, 1995, (Filing 703) this court gave all parties leave to file motions \n\"requesting that the court reconsider any of the findings and conclusion[s] set forth in ... \n[Klinger I] pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b)\" and the court further directed the parties to \"file \nsuch a motion, with a supporting brief, by April 10, 1995.\" \n3. On April 24, 1995, Defendants submitted a brief to the court wherein they stated: \"The \nCourt's opinion ... is clear and should stand on its own merits, as modified by the Court of \nAppeals.\" (Br.Opp'n Pls.' Mot.Am.Opinion Pursuant to FRCP 54(b) at 1.) In that same brief, \nDefendants noted that no motion for reconsideration had been filed by Defendants, id., and \nDefendants requested \"that this case proceed forward to the damage phase of the trial on \nthe only remaining issues — those related to the Plaintiffs' access-to-the-courts \nclaims.\" Id. at 8. \n4. Defendants never requested a modification of the court's earlier liability determination \nregarding access to the courts set forth in Klinger I until after the damage trial[4] was \nconcluded on September 18, 1995. \n5. On September 20, 1995, Defendants filed a motion (Filing 717) styled \"Motion to Alter or \nAmend Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\" alleging essentially two things. First, \nDefendants submitted that recent decisions from the United States Court of Appeals had \nclarified the law and established that Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proof on liability. \nSecondly, Defendants argued that evidence introduced at the damage phase of trial also \nrevealed that some of the court's earlier liability determinations were erroneous. \n6. Given the Court's earlier order of March 20, 1995 (Filing 703), the September 20, 1995, \nmotion (Filing 717) is untimely. \n7. Given the urging of Defendants in their brief of April 24, 1995, that the court not modify its \nprevious liability determination, Defendants' September 20, 1995, motion, coming after the \ndamage trial had been completed, would, if granted, unfairly surprise and prejudice \nPlaintiffs. \n8. None of the cases cited by Defendants in support of their September 20, 1995, motion \nmaterially changed the law insofar as liability is concerned, and all of the cases relied upon \nby Defendants were published substantially before trial on the damage phase began. See, \ne.g., Schrier v. Halford, 60 F.3d 1309 (8th Cir.1995) (July 27, 1995).[5] \n9. There is no factual merit to Defendants' claim that evidence adduced at the damage \nphase of trial materially contradicted the essential basis of the court's earlier access-to-the-\ncourts liability determination. For example: \nA. As to the issue of whether the law library was inadequate for general population inmates \nbecause the materials were disorganized and the library was too small, the law librarian[6] at \nNCW testified at the 1041*1041 damage phase of trial. She buttressed the previous liability \ndetermination, particularly as to the crowded and disorganized (\"piled all over\") condition of \nthe library. She testified that in the summer of 1988 the law library \"shelves are crowded. \nThere are materials on the floor because we were waiting. We know we need to move. It's \ngetting full. It's filling up.\" (D.T. 68:16-19). She also testified that \"books were placed on top \n\nof the other books\" (id. 47:10-11), there \"were some books stacked on the floor\" (id. 47:13-\n14), and, at least for books on the floor, the books \"may not have been in specific numeric \norder.\" (Id. 47:22). She further testified during the damage phase of trial that it would have \nbeen apparent to a first-time observer that something needed to be done in the summer of \n1988: \nTHE COURT: If someone new walked into that law library, never seen it before? \nTHE WITNESS: Yes. \nTHE COURT: Would it have been apparent to that person that something needed to be \ndone, that some change needed to be made? \nTHE WITNESS: Most likely. \nTHE COURT: And why do you say that? \nTHE WITNESS: Because of the crowded condition. \n(D.T. 69:12-20).[7] \nB. As to the issue of whether inmates in segregation and orientation were denied physical \naccess to the law library until 1989 when Wayne became superintendent[8] the librarian \ncorroborated this determination as well: \nQ. .... You said you didn't remember the time frame, but you remember sometime during \nLarry Wayne's administration when there was a formalized way for segregation inmates to \nget physical access to the law library? \nA. Yes. \nQ. And before that, there wasn't any routine plan for that? \nA. Well, the OM [operational memorandum] provides, the OM that was rewritten in '88, in \nSeptember of '88 does provide for that access, but there is nothing specific. \nQ. Right. And so and there wasn't any publication that you know of that the inmates could \nrequest that kind of physical access? \nA. Not that I recall.[9] \n(D.T. 61:7-20). \n10. The motion (Filing 717) styled \"Motion to Alter or Amend Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law\" should be denied. \nLiability Theory \n11. A complete and systematic denial of an inmate's constitutional right of access to the \ncourts is such a fundamental constitutional deprivation that it is injury in and of itself for \nliability purposes without a showing of actual injury or actual prejudice. Jones v. James, 38 \nF.3d 943, 945 (8th Cir.1994) (recognizing principle, but holding that inmate's claim — if he \nhad been allowed free 1042*1042 mailing privileges some attorney might have taken his \ncase — was too speculative); Hershberger v. Scaletta, 33 F.3d 955, 956 (8th \nCir.1994) (applying the principle, and upholding injunction barring postal charge for legal \nmail regarding inmates in segregation); Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1435 n. 115; Reutcke, 707 \nF.Supp. at 1129. \n12. On the other hand, if the alleged denial of the right of access to the courts does not \namount to a complete and systematic denial, then an inmate plaintiff must prove actual \ninjury or prejudice in order to establish liability. Schrier, 60 F.3d at 1313 (appointment of \nlawyer sufficient access to the courts to require inmate to show actual injury or \nprejudice); Hamm v. Groose, 15 F.3d 110, 112 (8th Cir.1994) (where inmate legal aides \n\nclaimed they were impeded in rendering assistance to illiterate inmates, but inmates had \naccess to the law library, the failure to assert actual injury or prejudice justified dismissal). \nDamage Theory \n13. There are three types of damages which are normally recoverable once liability has \nbeen established in a civil rights case such as this one: actual or compensatory damages, \nnominal damages, and punitive damages. Manual of Model Civil Jury Instructions for the \nDistrict Courts of the Eighth Circuit § 4.51 at 73 (West 1995) (Committee Comments). \n14. \"[A]ctual or compensatory damages are to `compensate persons for injuries that are \ncaused by the deprivation of constitutional rights,' and not `undefinable value of infringed \nright' or `presumed' damages.\" Id. (quoting Memphis Community Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 \nU.S. 299, 307, 309, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 2543, 2544, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986)). \n15. Actual damages, which may include out-of-pocket losses, other monetary losses, or \nlosses for personal humiliation, mental anguish and suffering, must, nevertheless, be the \n\"direct result\" of the \"conduct of the defendant\" in order to be recoverable. Id. § 4.51 at 72. \n16. Nominal damages are appropriate where the finder of fact is unable to place a monetary \nvalue on the harm suffered by the plaintiff. Id. § 4.52 at 74. See also Cowans v. Wyrick, 862 \nF.2d 697, 699 (8th Cir.1988). \n17. \"Presumed\" damages may be awarded as a substitute for actual or compensatory \ndamages only in those rare situations \"[w]hen a plaintiff seeks compensation for an injury \nthat is likely to have occurred but difficult to establish.\" Stachura, 477 U.S. at 310-11, 106 \nS.Ct. at 2544-45. \n18. \"Presumed damages\" have historically been limited to those classes of cases where the \nlaw, without requiring proof of damage, has inferred \"substantial money damages\" merely \nfrom proof of liability, such as where a person is wrongly prohibited from voting in a \nparticular election or in cases of actionable slander. Id. at 311-12 n. 14, 106 S.Ct. at 2545-\n46 n. 14. \n19. Although the \"precise impact Stachura will have on the availability of presumed \ndamages in section 1983 actions remains to be seen,\" 2 Joseph G. Cook & John L. \nSobieski, Jr., Civil Rights Actions ¶ 4.07 at 4-58.3 (1995), when one is dealing with the \nnormal type of case where \"damages are readily measurable,\" presumed damages are not \nappropriate. Lewis v. Harrison Sch. Dist. No. 1, 805 F.2d 310, 317 (8th Cir.1986), cert. \ndenied, 482 U.S. 905, 107 S.Ct. 2481, 96 L.Ed.2d 374 (1987) (\"Any door left open \nby Memphis [Stachura] is not for plaintiffs like Lewis, whose damages are readily \nmeasurable.\") (footnote omitted). \n20. Because there is no Eighth Circuit precedent authorizing \"presumed damages\" in a \ncase like this one, because historically presumed damages have not been awarded in \ncases like this one, and because actual or compensatory damages are normally \nmeasurable in cases like this one, a violation of the right to access to the courts, even if the \n\nviolation is complete and systematic, is not the type of injury where \"presumed damages\" \nmay be used as a substitute for actual or compensatory damages. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at \n1136. \n1043*1043 21. The purpose of punitive damages is to \"`punish the defendant for his willful or \nmalicious conduct and to deter others from similar behavior.'\" Id. (quoting Stachura, 477 \nU.S. at 306 n. 9, 106 S.Ct. at 2542 n. 9). \n22. Imposition of punitive damages requires a showing of reckless and callous indifference \nto the plaintiffs' rights. Manual of Model Civil Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the \nEighth Circuit § 4.53 at 76. \n23. Whether to award punitive damages, and the amount of those damages, is within the \nsound discretion of the factfinder. Id. \nLiability: General Population Inmates \n24. In general, for the time period prior to January, 1989, the plaintiffs proved a complete \nand systematic violation of Bounds regarding general population inmates because: (a) no \ntrained and independent inmate legal aide had been appointed; and (b) the law library was \nnot adequate in that it was too small and its collection was disorganized. \n25. In particular, the NCW law library at all pertinent times was so disorganized that the \ncondition of the law library amounted to a complete and systematic denial of access to the \ncourts under Bounds, even though the general population inmates at NCW had physical \naccess to the library. Simply stated, access to a disorganized pile of books stored in a small \nroom \"[b]arely big enough to turn around in\" (L.T. Vol. I, 143:9-10) is not access to a law \nlibrary. \n26. For example, Linda Lange, who later became the inmate legal aide, testified, in \nresponse to a question dealing with the organization of the library, that before she \norganized the law library in January of 1989 when she became the aide: \"I wasn't able to \nuse most of the stuff.\" (L.T. Vol X, 2638:9-12). Indeed, Lange testified that the first thing she \ndid when she was appointed inmate legal aide was to \"organize it,\" \"clean it up,\" and \"do an \ninventory.\" (Id. 2650:8-9.) Prior to this time \"[y]ou couldn't really organize it because the \nbooks were piled all over because there was no shelf to put them on, so they just stayed \npiled.\" (Id. 2650:11-13). \n27. The law library was so disorganized that it did not even contain accurate and upto-date \ncopies of the operational memorandum and administrative regulations that guided all \nNebraska prisons and DCS. (L.T. Vol. I, 147:4-16) (\"not in any particular sequence\" and \n\"outdated\"). For example, inmate Cheryl Klinger, who had experience as a legal secretary \n(id. 144:7-8; 145:11-13) and as a secretary for a parole administrator (id. 120:11-13), could \nnot \"match up\" operational memorandum and administrative regulations that were found in \nthe NCW library with copies of \"OMs\" and \"ARs\" received from other Nebraska penal \ninstitutions. (Id. 158:15-25; 159:1). This was especially significant to Klinger because she \nwas the person who drafted the grievance that prompted this lawsuit. (Id. 149:4-5). The \n\nability to make an accurate comparison of \"OMs\" and \"ARs\" was important to Klinger \nbecause it formed the basis for the grievance which alleged, among other things, that \nfemale inmates were treated less favorably than male inmates. (Id. 149:6-7; 158:15-18.) \nDamages: General Population Inmates \n28. Plaintiffs admit that they have no evidence that \"someone missed an appeal deadline or \nlost their case because of their inability to get into or have adequate assistance in the law \nlibrary.\" (D.T. 133:12-14). Plaintiffs have not proven that they suffered any out-of-pocket or \nother related monetary losses. \n29. While Plaintiffs proved that they suffered emotional distress resulting from the inequality \nin how female inmates were treated as compared to male inmates, Plaintiffs have not \npersuaded me that such emotional distress was caused in whole or in part by \nthe Bounds violation. Rather, I am persuaded that the female inmates suffered emotional \ndistress because of the equal protection violation committed by Gunter and Clarke, a \nviolation that has now been determined, by the court of appeals, not to have been \nproven. Klinger II. \n30. Because Plaintiffs, individually and as a class, are unable to show Lofgreen or Tewes \ncaused actual or compensatory damages, 1044*1044 and because this type of case is not \nthe type of case where presumed damages have been recognized, I shall award $1.00 as \nnominal damages to the general population inmates with respect to the complete and \nsystematic violation of Bounds because I am unable to put a dollar value on the harm \nPlaintiffs suffered. Hershberger, 33 F.3d at 956 n. 3; Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1136; Manual \nof Model Civil Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the Eighth Circuit § 4.52 at 74-75. \n31. The evidence establishes that neither Lofgreen nor Tewes was recklessly and callously \nindifferent to the rights of the general population inmates under Bounds. Moreover, in the \nexercise of my discretion, I do not believe that punitive damages are warranted insofar as \nthe general population inmates are concerned. \n32. Four examples will serve to illustrate why I do not believe that punitive damages are \nappropriate: \nA. The law librarian testified that plans were made as soon as it was apparent that the law \nlibrary was overcrowded to move the library and shelves were ordered for that purpose. \n(D.T. 69:25-71:9). The librarian further testified that it was the delay in receiving the shelving \nthat delayed the eventual move of the law library. (D.T. 70:17-71:3). She also testified that \nneither Lofgreen nor Tewes were indifferent to this problem. (D.T. 71:4-7). \nB. Because he was concerned that the inmates did not know how to use the law library, in \nthe spring of 1988 Lofgreen wrote to various law schools seeking information on \ncorrespondence courses which could be offered to NCW inmates to assist them in the use \nof the law library. (D.T. 75:10-77:6). This activity took place in April of 1988 (D.T. 75:22-\n76:5), prior to the NCW inmates' July 1988 suit in this case. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1382. \nThis conduct is inconsistent with the assertion that Lofgreen was recklessly and callously \nindifferent to the legal needs of the inmates. \n\nC. Tewes, who came from the DCS central office, was a temporary superintendent at NCW \nwho served the institution about five months. (D.T. 99:11-16.) He had no prior experience \nas a superintendent; in fact, he had never worked in a correctional institution prior to serving \nas temporary superintendent. (D.T. 99:20-22). Because Lofgreen apparently resigned \nunexpectedly, Tewes \"had no time to become oriented to\" the job at NCW, but rather \nstarted work the day after Lofgreen left. (Id. 100:22-101:3). Tewes also maintained many of \nhis responsibilities at the DCS central office acting as a program director. (Id. 100:9-21). \nTewes had little time or opportunity to familiarize himself with the problems at NCW, he had \nno experience in actually running a prison, and he was overworked. Accordingly, the lack of \ntime, experience, and opportunity for orientation suggests that Tewes was not motivated by \ncallous and reckless disregard of the inmates. \nD. Within approximately one month after Judge Urbom's adoption of Judge Piester's report \nand recommendation in Reutcke in June of 1988, Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1435, inmate \nLange was selected by Lofgreen as a potential inmate legal aide and her training was \nstarted. (D.T. 53:23-54:8). This relatively quick response by Lofgreen is not indicative of \nreckless and callous disregard by Lofgreen. While Lange completed her training in \nSeptember of 1988 when Tewes was the superintendent, she was not appointed as a legal \naide until January of 1989. The reasons for this delay, according to the law librarian, were \nbecause of various administrative concerns raised by the staff, including \"some misconduct \nreports that Ms. Lange had received.\" (D.T. 40:12-42:16). While the reasons for the delay \nare debatable, the explanation by the law librarian is inconsistent with the assertion of \nreckless and callous indifference on the part of Tewes, particularly given Tewes' lack of \nexperience, lack of orientation to his job, his temporary status, and the fact that he was \noverworked. \nLiability: Segregation and Orientation Inmates \n33. In general, for the time period prior to January, 1989, plaintiffs proved \na 1045*1045 systematic and complete violation of Bounds regarding segregation and \norientation inmates because: (a) no trained and independent inmate legal aide had been \nappointed; and (b) these inmates had no physical access to the law library. Moreover, for \nthe reasons articulated above, even if these inmates had physical access to the library, \nPlaintiffs would have nevertheless proven a complete and systematic violation \nof Bounds because there was no trained and independent inmate legal aide, and the law \nlibrary was not adequate in that it was too small and its collection was disorganized. \n34. To the extent that Defendants seriously argue that the policy of allowing inmates in \nsegregation or orientation to \"order\" law library books amounted to \"some access\" to the \nlaw library and thus there was no complete and systematic violation of Bounds, I reject the \nargument. If an inmate, who has no access to a trained legal aide, cannot physically go to \nthe law library, the process of \"ordering\" books from the law library is no substitute for \nphysical access to the library. This is particularly true for prisoners, like the vast majority of \nNCW inmates, who are poorly educated and untrained in the law. Moreover, this point is \neven more compelling where, as here, the law library was utterly disorganized. \n35. As the Fourth Circuit said in 1978, \"Simply providing a prisoner with books in his cell, if \nhe requests them, gives the prisoner no meaningful chance to explore the legal remedies \nhe might have.\" Williams v. Leeke, 584 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 442 \n\nU.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 2825, 61 L.Ed.2d 276 (1979). Indeed, it is \"unrealistic to expect a \nprisoner to know in advance exactly what materials he needs to consult.\" Id. Rather, such a \npolicy amounts to a complete and systematic denial of the right of access to the \ncourts. Reutcke, 707 F.Supp. at 1132 (\"The simple fact is that if the state denies a prisoner \ndirect physical access to a law library, the state must provide that prisoner, no matter what \nhis status, with assistance by trained, skilled, and independent legal personnel.\") (citations \nomitted); Watson v. Norris, 729 F.Supp. 581, 585-86 (M.D.Tenn.1989) (Tennessee \ncorrectional institution deprived inmates in segregation of their right of access to the courts \nby prohibiting physical access to prison library when prison policy allowed \"jailhouse lawyer\" \nto refuse, in his sole discretion, to help the segregated inmate). \n36. Schrier cannot fairly be read to require a different conclusion. \nDamages: Segregation and Orientation Inmates \n37. For the same reasons earlier stated regarding general population inmates, I award \nsegregation and orientation inmates $1.00 in nominal damages. \n38. For the same reasons earlier stated regarding general population inmates, I decline to \naward compensatory or actual damages, presumed damages, or punitive damages to the \nsegregation and orientation inmates. \nII. Attorney Fees Application \nNow that all liability and remedy issues have been resolved, it is necessary to set a \nschedule for the filing of an application for attorney fees. NELR §§ 54.3 & 83.14 (West \n1995). In this regard, the parties have advised me that: (a) all evidence on the issue of \nwhether this case was a catalyst for change regarding attorney fees was presented in the \ndamage phase of trial; (b) all other evidentiary matters regarding attorney fees can be \npresented by way of affidavit; (c) the plaintiffs should be given approximately 21 days to file \ntheir application and affidavits for attorney fees with supporting brief, and the defendants \nshould be given approximately 21 days thereafter to respond; and (d) neither party objects \nto the court withholding judgment until after resolution of the attorney-fee question. \nAccordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The motion (Filing 717) styled \"Motion to Alter or Amend Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law\" is denied; \n2. Plaintiffs are given until November 6th, 1995, to file their application and affidavits for \nattorney fees with supporting brief, 1046*1046 and Defendants are given until November \n27th, 1995, to respond; and \n3. Judgment shall be withheld until further order. \n\n[1] There is no basis for injunctive relief in this case because the violation ended in January of 1989, and there is no \nevidence or claim that such a violation is likely to reoccur. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1464-65. \n[2] For this court's ruling on remand from Klinger II on the issue of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (Title IX), see Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Servs., 887 F.Supp. 1281 \n(D.Neb.1995) (in light of the findings of Klinger II that men's and women's prisons in Nebraska were not factually \ncomparable, women were not denied equal education on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX) (Klinger III). \n[3] Any finding of fact that is more properly construed as a conclusion of law shall be so construed, and any \nconclusion of law that is more properly construed as a finding of fact shall be so construed. \n[4] As a matter of fact, after all the evidence was presented at the damage trial, counsel for the defendants stated \n\"that the effort we have made is not to relitigate.\" (One-Volume Damage Trial Transcript of Sept. 18, 1995, 130:18-\n19) (hereinafter \"D.T.\"). \n[5] For example, unlike Schrier, there was no issue in this case about whether NCW was constitutionally required to \nprovide a law library for medical malpractice claims even if the law library was otherwise adequate for other types of \nclaims. Rather, the plaintiffs' claim was, and the evidence showed, that the law library was inadequate for all legal \nresearch matters, including criminal, habeas corpus, and civil rights actions (as well as general civil matters) because \nthe library was too small and because it was disorganized. \n[6] Ms. Janice Axdahl, the librarian, was an extremely credible witness who was grossly overworked. As I noted \nin Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1436, \"Ms. Axdahl was an NCW staff member whose duties were many. For example, she \nwas involved in education, orientation and recreation at NCW at various times.\" \n[7] The librarian further stated that there was \"a\" chair and square table in the library in addition to a typewriter stand. \n(D.T. 69:6-11). While this testimony is slightly different than what I had earlier understood for purposes of the liability \ndetermination, as noted in the text, the librarian nevertheless confirmed at the damage trial that it was apparent that \nsomething needed to be done \"[b]ecause of the crowded condition.\" (D.T. 69:15-20.) In all material respects, the \nlibrarian's testimony at the damage phase of trial was entirely consistent with the inmate legal aide's liability phase \ntestimony. Linda Lange, the inmate legal aide, testified that the law library was inadequate because it was too small \nand the legal materials were not organized. (Liability Trial Transcript (L.T.) Vol. X, 2636:17-25; 2637:1-2638:12; \n2649:9-15; 2650:6-14). \n[8] During the liability phase of trial Wayne testified that \"[i]n the fall of 1989, I initiated a procedure by which women \nhoused in the segregation unit could have physical access to the law library at NCW.\" (L.T. Vol. XIII 3634:14-17). And \nWayne further stated that it was \"after I arrived at NCW [January 5, 1989], orientation women were provided access \nto the law library.\" (Id. 3638:16-18). \n[9] Thus, the actual practice did not change. \n ",

After holding a bench trial on liability issues, the district court \nissued an opinion in Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Servs., 824 F.Supp. 1374 \n(D.Neb. 1993) (Klinger I), rev'd, 31 F.3d 727 (8th Cir.1994) (Klinger II), cert. denied, ___ \nU.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1177, 130 L.Ed.2d 1130 (1995), and certified certain questions to this \ncourt for interlocutory review. On appeal in Klinger II, we reversed the district court's finding \nof an equal protection violation and remanded the case to the district court, which thereafter \nissued three more opinions. Id., 887 F.Supp. 1281 (D.Neb.1995) (Klinger III); id., 902 \nF.Supp. 1036 (D.Neb.1995) (Klinger IV); id., 909 F.Supp. 1329 (D.Neb. 1995) (Klinger V). \nFollowing the district court's entry of final judgment, the parties filed the present appeal and \ncross-appeal. 612*612 Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's judgment in favor of \ndefendants on plaintiffs' Title IX claim. For reversal, plaintiffs argue that the district court \nerroneously concluded that our decision in Klinger II required judgment in favor of \ndefendants on the Title IX claim. Individual defendants Victor Lofgreen and Larry Tewes \ncross-appeal from the district court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs on plaintiffs' access-to-\ncourts claim, for which defendants Lofgreen and Tewes were held personally liable to pay \n$2.00 in nominal damages and plaintiffs were awarded $40,642.44 in attorneys' fees and \nexpenses. For reversal, defendants Lofgreen and Tewes argue that (1) plaintiffs failed to \nestablish a constitutional violation as a matter of law because there was no complete and \nsystemic denial of access or because plaintiffs suffered no actual injury, (2) they are \nprotected by qualified immunity from personal liability for damages, and (3) the award of \nattorneys' fees and expenses is unreasonable under Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113 \nS.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). Upon careful review and for the reasons set forth below, \nwe now affirm the district court's judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' Title IX claim, \nreverse the district court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their access-to-courts claim, and \nvacate the award of attorneys' fees and expenses. \nBackground \nThe background facts of this case are set forth in detail in the district court's opinion \nin Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1380-86, and are partially and more briefly summarized in the \n\nremaining opinions cited above. For purposes of this appeal, the following is a summary of \nthe procedural history of this case. In 1988, four NCW inmates, acting pro se, initiated this § \n1983 action. The district court appointed counsel and certified the plaintiff class, which \nincludes all persons incarcerated at NCW on or after January 1, 1988. NCW is the only \nNebraska prison for women; accordingly, all women incarcerated in Nebraska are housed at \nNCW.[2] In their amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged that the educational and vocational \ntraining opportunities at NCW were inferior to those of male inmates at the Nebraska State \nPenitentiary (NSP). Consistent with plaintiffs' limited factual allegations, the district court \nconfined plaintiffs' equal protection and Title IX claims to a comparison between NCW and \nNSP. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1388 & n. 14. Plaintiffs also alleged, among other things, that \ndefendants had failed to provide NCW inmates with an adequate law library or assistance \nfrom persons trained in the law. \nAfter the district court granted partial summary judgment to defendants, the case proceeded \nto trial, which the district court had bifurcated into a liability phase and a remedial phase. \nFollowing a four-week trial on liability issues, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had \nproven an equal protection violation, a Title IX violation, and a deprivation of their right of \nmeaningful access to the courts. Id. at 1466-69. The district court found defendants Frank \nGunter and Harold Clarke personally liable for the equal protection and Title IX \nviolations, id. at 1466, and defendants Lofgreen and Tewes personally liable for the access-\nto-courts violation, notwithstanding their claims of qualified immunity, id. at 1468-69. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), the district court then certified to this court three issues of \nlaw related to the equal protection claim. On interlocutory appeal, this court reversed the \ndistrict court's finding of liability on the equal protection claim and dismissed that \nclaim. Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 734. This court reasoned that \"NSP and NCW are different \ninstitutions with different inmates each operating with limited resources to fulfill different \nspecific needs. Thus, whether NCW lacks one program that NSP has proves almost \nnothing.\" Id. at 732 (citation omitted). \"[C]omparing programs at NSP to those at NCW is \nlike the proverbial comparison of apples to oranges.\" Id. at 733. This court thus concluded \nthat plaintiffs' equal protection claim failed as a matter of law because inmates at NCW and \ninmates at NSP are not \"similarly situated.\" Id. \n613*613 After the case was remanded to the district court, plaintiffs sought permission to \nrecharacterize their equal protection claims as Title IX claims. Klinger III, 887 F.Supp. at \n1285. The district court instead sua sponte elected to reverse its earlier finding of a Title IX \nviolation. Id. The district court reasoned that the holding of Klinger II destroyed the probative \nforce of the evidence upon which it relied in deciding both the equal protection and the Title \nIX claims (i.e., the comparative inequality between NSP and NCW educational and \nvocational training programs). Id. \nThe case then proceeded to the second phase of the trial (the remedial phase) which, by \nthis time, had been narrowed to assessing damages resulting from the access-to-courts \nviolation. Following a bench trial, the district court set forth findings of fact and conclusions \nof law, Klinger IV, 902 F.Supp. at 1039-45, and established a schedule for resolving the \nissue of attorneys' fees, id. at 1045-46. On the access-to-courts issue, the district court \nfound that the general inmate population at NCW had been completely and systematically \ndenied meaningful access to the courts for the time period prior to January 1989. Id. at \n\n1043. However, because there was no evidence that anyone suffered any actual injury as a \nresult of the deprivation, and there was no evidence to show that defendants Lofgreen or \nTewes acted deliberately or with reckless indifference to the rights of the general population \nprisoners, the district court awarded only $1.00 in nominal damages. Id. at 1043-44. The \ndistrict court separately found that segregation and orientation inmates were also \ncompletely and systematically denied meaningful access to the courts. Id. at 1044-45. The \ndistrict court reasoned that, although those inmates theoretically could order law books, the \nprivilege was meaningless because those inmates were not provided any legal assistance \nor access to a law library. Id. at 1045. The district court then awarded the segregation and \norientation inmates $1.00 in nominal damages. Id. Citing Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 97 \nS.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), and Reutcke v. Dahm, 707 F.Supp. 1121 \n(D.Neb.1988), the district court also reaffirmed its earlier rejection of Lofgreen's and \nTewes's qualified immunity defense. Klinger IV, 902 F.Supp. at 1040 (citing Klinger I, 824 \nF.Supp. at 1469). \nFollowing the parties' submission of briefs on the attorneys' fees issue, the district court filed \na written decision awarding plaintiffs $37,084.92 in attorneys' fees and $3,557.52 in \nexpenses. Klinger V, 909 F.Supp. at 1342. The district court reasoned that, notwithstanding \nplaintiffs' recovery of only $2.00 in nominal damages, their success was not merely \ntechnical or de minimis and therefore they were not precluded from recovering attorneys' \nfees under Farrar v. Hobby. Klinger V, 909 F.Supp. at 1334. Thereafter, final judgment was \nentered. Plaintiffs timely appealed, and defendants cross-appealed.[3] \nDiscussion \nTitle IX claim \nPlaintiffs argue that the district court erred when it sua sponte reversed its finding of a \nviolation under Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a),[4] upon concluding that such reversal was \nmandated by our equal protection analysis in Klinger II. The district court reasoned as \nfollows. \n614*614 Because the Court of Appeals has held as a matter of law that \"comparing \nprograms at NSP to those at NCW is like the proverbial comparison of apples to \noranges,\" Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 733, the evidence in this case, when reexamined in light \nof Klinger II, fails to establish a Title IX violation. This is specifically true because (1) the \nevidence of discrimination, intentional or otherwise, and whether viewed in light of the Equal \nProtection Clause or Title IX, is largely (if not totally) dependent upon a factual comparison \nof NSP with NCW to the exclusion of all other Nebraska prisons, Klinger II, 31 F.3d at \n729; Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1384 n. 6 & 1388 n. 14; and (2) Plaintiffs do not claim that the \nallegedly inferior programs at NCW result from discriminatory funding, since Nebraska \nspends more money per capita at NCW than at any other adult prison in its system. Klinger \nII, 31 F.3d at 731 n. 2; Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1392-93. \nIn sum, if NSP is not factually comparable to NCW, then \"[d]ifferences between challenged \nprograms at the two prisons are virtually irrelevant because so many variables affect the \nmix of programming that an institution has.\" Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 733. Therefore, since the \nplaintiffs have presented no other relevant or persuasive evidence tending to prove a Title \n\nIX violation, it follows that the plaintiffs have failed in their burden to prove that the NCW \nwomen were denied educational opportunities in violation of Title IX \"on the basis of sex.\" \nKlinger III, 887 F.Supp. at 1286-87. \nWe agree with plaintiffs insofar as they assert that the standard for finding a Title IX \nviolation differs from the standard applicable to a constitutional equal protection claim. See, \ne.g., Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1226-27 (9th Cir.1994), citing Canterino v. \nWilson, 546 F.Supp. 174, 210 (W.D.Ky. 1982) (Title IX standard is \"equality\" as compared \nwith the equal protection standard of \"parity\"), vacated on other grounds, 869 F.2d 948 (6th \nCir.1989). In other words, plaintiffs are correct to assert that their failure to prove an equal \nprotection violation does not preclude their Title IX claim as a matter of law. See, \ne.g., Horner v. Kentucky High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, 43 F.3d 265 (6th Cir.1994) (reversing \ngrant of summary judgment for defendants on Title IX claim but affirming summary \njudgment for defendants on similar equal protection claim where facially neutral rule \ndisparately impacted boys' and girls' interscholastic athletic programs but there was no \nevidence of discriminatory intent). We further agree with plaintiffs' argument that the \n\"similarly situated\" requirement applied in equal protection cases does not apply to Title IX \nanalyses. Title IX provides, in pertinent part: \"No person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance, except that [listing exceptions].\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).[5] In our opinion, Congress \nhas indicated, by its enactment of § 1681(a) and by the specific language employed therein, \nthat female and male participants within a given federally-funded education program or \nactivity are presumed similarly situated for purposes of being entitled to equal educational \nopportunities within that program or activity. Because Title IX is only concerned with \nconditions of gender discrimination and inequality within federally-funded educational \nprograms or activities, the question of whether males, as a group, are otherwise similarly \nsituated 615*615 to females, as a group, need not be considered in this narrow context.[6] \nNevertheless, we disagree with plaintiffs' assertion that, in the present case, they may \nproperly assert a Title IX claim by comparing educational opportunities available to female \nprisoners at NCW with educational opportunities available to male prisoners only at NSP. \nTitle IX prohibits gender-based inequality or discrimination \"under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" Title IX's definition of \"program or activity,\" \n20 U.S.C. § 1687, provides in pertinent part: \nFor the purposes of this chapter, the term \"program or activity\" and \"program\" mean all of \nthe operations of — \n(1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or \nof a local government; or \n(B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each \nsuch department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the \nassistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government; \n.... \nany part of which is extended Federal financial assistance, except that [stating an exception \nthat does not apply in the present case]. \n\nThe legislative history of § 1687 contains the following explanation: \nFor education institutions, the bill provides that where federal aid is extended anywhere \nwithin a college, university, or public system of higher education, the entire institution or \nsystem is covered. If federal aid is extended anywhere in an elementary or secondary \nschool system, the entire system is covered. \nFor State and local governments, only the department or agency which receives the aid is \ncovered. Where an entity of state or local government receives federal aid and distributes it \nto another department or agency, both entities are covered. \n.... \nFor other entities established by two or more of the above-described entities, the entire \nentity is covered if it receives any federal aid. \nS.Rep. No. 100-64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n(Legislative History) 3, 6 (summary of the bill). In other words, the purpose of § 1687 was \n\"to make clear that discrimination is prohibited throughout entire agencies or institutions if \nany part receives Federal financial assistance.\" Id.[7] \nIn the present case, the subset of Nebraska prisons comprised of NCW and NSP, clearly \ndoes not constitute a \"program or activity\" within the meaning of § 1687. The Nebraska \nprison system as a whole, however, does qualify as a \"program or activity\" within the \nstatutory definition. See 20 U.S.C. § 1687(1)(A) (the term \"program or activity\" means \"all of \nthe operations of ... a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality \nof a State or of a local government\" which receives federal funds). It is undisputed that DCS \nis the recipient of federal funds. See Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1432 (noting parties' \nstipulation). \nIt is beyond controversy that male and female prisoners may lawfully be segregated into \nseparate institutions within a prison system. Gender-based prisoner segregation and \nsegregation based upon prisoners' security levels are common and necessary practices. \nWhen considering single-sex prisons, the only logical and workable application \nof 616*616 the definition of \"program or activity\" under Title IX requires comparison of \neducational opportunities for female and male prisoners within the entire system of \ninstitutions operated by a state's federally-funded correctional department or agency, taking \ninto account the objective differences between the male and female prison populations and \nsuch penological and security considerations as are necessary to accommodate in this \nunique context.[8] See Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d at 1228-29 (taking into consideration \ndifferences between circumstances of female and male prison populations in Oregon prison \nsystem and holding that \"[a]lthough the programs need not be identical in number or \ncontent, women must have reasonable opportunities for similar studies and must have an \nequal opportunity to participate in programs of comparable quality\"). This is not to say that \nno comparison can be made, consistent with Title IX, where there are significant differences \nbetween male and female prison populations within a state's correctional system, such as \nunequal population sizes and lengths of stay. Rather, equal opportunities must be afforded \nconsistent with those differences. See id. Because plaintiffs' comparison of the educational \nopportunities at NCW to those at NSP fails to provide a meaningful comparison of \neducational opportunities for male and female prisoners in the Nebraska prison system as a \nwhole, the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs' evidence was not sufficiently \n\nrelevant or persuasive to prove a violation of Title IX. See Klinger III, 887 F.Supp. at 1287. \nWe therefore affirm the district court's judgment on the Title IX claim. \nAccess-to-courts claim \nOn cross-appeal, defendants Lofgreen and Tewes argue that the district court erred in \nholding that plaintiffs had been denied meaningful access to the courts during the period of \nJanuary 1988 to January 1989. They refer to the Supreme Court's 1977 landmark decision \nin Bounds v. Smith, which essentially held that a state could afford prisoners meaningful \naccess to the courts by providing either access to an adequate law library or adequate \nassistance from persons trained in the law. 430 U.S. at 828, 97 S.Ct. at 1498. It is \nundisputed that NCW inmates were not provided any assistance from someone with legal \ntraining until January 1989. The issue in this case focuses on plaintiffs' access to an \nadequate law library. Describing the purported law library as \"a disorganized pile of books \nstored in a small room,\" the district court held that \"the NCW law library at all pertinent times \nwas so disorganized that the condition of the law library amounted to a complete and \nsystematic denial of access to the courts under Bounds, even though the general population \ninmates at NCW had physical access to the library.\" Klinger IV, 902 F.Supp. at 1043. Thus, \nthe district court found a constitutional violation notwithstanding plaintiffs' inability to show \nthat any NCW inmate was hindered or precluded from engaging in legal activity or suffered \na monetary loss as a consequence of the deprivation. Id. at 1043-45. Citing Jones v. \nJames, 38 F.3d 943, 945 (8th Cir. 1994), the district court explained \"[a] complete and \nsystematic denial of an inmate's constitutional right of access to the courts is such a \nfundamental constitutional deprivation that it is injury in and of itself for liability purposes \nwithout a showing of actual injury or actual prejudice.\" Klinger IV, 902 F.Supp. at 1041. \nDefendants Lofgreen and Tewes argue that the present case is more like Schrier v. \nHalford, 60 F.3d 1309 (8th Cir.1995), where this court held that actual injury or prejudice \nmust be shown if the denial of access is not complete and systemic. They suggest that \nthere was at least some access to a law library because the general population inmates had \naccess to the \"disorganized pile of books stored in a small room,\" and the segregation and \norientation inmates could request books. Lofgreen and Tewes also rely on the Supreme \nCourt's very recent decision in Lewis v. Casey, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d \n606 (1996), for the proposition that actual injury or prejudice must be shown even if the \ndenial of access is complete and systemic. \n617*617 Upon careful review, we hold that plaintiffs' access-to-courts claim fails as a matter \nof law under Lewis v. Casey, which was decided after the district court rendered its decision \nin the present case. In Lewis v. Casey, the Supreme Court held, based upon principles of \nstanding, that actual injury must be proven in order to prevail on an access-to-courts \nclaim. Id. at ___-___, 116 S.Ct. at 2179-80 (\"[i]nsofar as the right vindicated by Bounds is \nconcerned, `meaningful access to the courts is the touchstone' ... and the inmate therefore \nmust go one step further and demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or \nlegal assistance program hindered his [or her] efforts to pursue a legal claim\"). Accordingly, \neven though plaintiffs did show a complete and systemic denial of access to a law library or \nlegal assistance prior to January 1989, plaintiffs' claim fails as a matter of law because none \nof the inmates at NCW suffered actual injury or prejudice as a result of that denial of \naccess. See Klinger IV, 902 F.Supp. at 1043. We therefore reverse the district court's \n\njudgment on the access-to-courts claim and vacate the award of attorneys' fees and \nexpenses.[9] \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment in favor of defendants on \nplaintiffs' Title IX claim, reverse the district court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their \naccess-to-courts claim, and vacate the award of attorneys' fees and expenses. \n[1] The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska. \n[2] DCS also runs two co-ed work release centers which are not enclosed secured prisons and which the district court \ndetermined were not relevant to the issues in this litigation. See Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Servs., 887 \nF.Supp. 1281, 1282 n. 2 (D.Neb.1995). \n[3] After the parties filed their appeals, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was signed into law. Defendants \nrequested permission to file supplemental briefs addressing the applicability of the PLRA to the present case. \nPermission was granted. An amicus brief on this issue was also filed by the State of Missouri on behalf of numerous \nstates which support defendants' position regarding the applicability of the PLRA. In addition, plaintiffs and \ndefendants submitted letters to this court pursuant to Rule 28(j) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, bringing \nto our attention two recent Supreme Court decisions. Plaintiffs have cited United States v. Virginia, ___ U.S. ___, 116 \nS.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996), and defendants have cited Lewis v. Casey, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 \nL.Ed.2d 606 (1996). \n[4] 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, \nexcept that ... [listing exceptions which do not apply in the present case]. \n[5] To the extent that exceptions are to be recognized, Congress has specifically enumerated certain exemptions in \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2)-(9). Notably, the statute does not exempt correctional institutions, although it does expressly \nexempt — among other types of entities — religious schools, military schools, fraternities, sororities, voluntary youth \norganizations, and beauty pageants. \"When a statute lists specific exemptions, other exemptions are not to be \njudicially implied.\" Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1225 (9th Cir. 1994) (referring to exemptions in 20 U.S.C. § \n1687(a)(3)-(9)); see also Canterino v. Wilson, 546 F.Supp. 174, 210 (W.D.Ky.1982) (noting that Congress was \n\"certainly aware\" that non-discrimination statutes such as Title IX \"could result in administrative problems in many \nareas\" and, accordingly, some exceptions were made in 20 U.S.C. § 1687(a)(1)(9); under these circumstances, a \ncourt cannot impose a special exception for correctional institutions), vacated on other grounds, 869 F.2d 948 (6th \nCir.1989). \n[6] Accordingly, we disagree with the D.C. Circuit's assumption in Women Prisoners v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d \n910, 927 (D.C.Cir.1996), that \"the court's Title IX and equal protection analyses both depend on findings that [female \nprisoners and male prisoners to whom they were compared] were similarly situated.\" \n[7] The legislation was deemed to reverse the Supreme Court's decision in Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, \n104 S.Ct. 1211, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984), which had narrowed Title IX's application to only those specific education \nprograms and activities which directly received federal funds. See S.Rep. No. 100-64, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6 & \n11-16 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. (Legislative History) 3, 7-8 & 13-18. \n[8] In addition, co-ed institutions may not discriminate on the basis of sex in providing educational opportunities to \ninmates within a given institution. \n\n[9] Because we hold that the district court erred in finding that a constitutional access-to-courts violation had \noccurred, we need not address the issues of qualified immunity, the excessiveness of the award of attorneys' fees \nand expenses, or the applicability of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. \n ",

We are asked to determine \nwhether the district court properly applied the law in finding present and \npast 729*729 administrators of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services \n(Department) liable for violating the equal protection rights of female inmates (plaintiffs) in \nthe Department's prison system as to the provision of prison programs and services in this \nclass action suit. Because we hold that the plaintiffs are not similarly situated to male \ninmates at Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP) for purposes of prison programs and \nservices, we reverse the district court's order and dismiss the plaintiffs' equal protection \nclaim. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe Department is a Nebraska state agency that runs the state's ten correctional facilities. \nOf the ten facilities, Nebraska Center for Women (NCW) is the only one that exclusively \nhouses women. Besides NCW, the Department runs four facilities that house only men: \nNSP, the Lincoln Correctional Center, the Omaha Correctional Center, and the Hastings \n\nCorrectional Center. The Department also operates two institutions that house both men \nand women and three institutions for juvenile offenders. \nIn July 1988, four NCW inmates filed a pro se complaint in district court, alleging that the \nDepartment was treating male inmates more favorably than female inmates with regard to \nprison programs and services. In October 1988, the district court appointed counsel to \nrepresent the pro se inmates. Counsel filed an amended complaint alleging equal protection \nviolations and a motion for class certification. The district court certified a plaintiff class \nincluding \"all women who were NCW inmates at any time on or after January 1, 1988, \nthrough the conclusion of th[e] case.\" \nIn April 1989, the magistrate judge warned the plaintiffs to specify each male institution to \nwhich they sought to compare programs and services. In June 1989, the plaintiffs filed a \nsecond amended complaint, alleging that they receive inferior programs and services in \ncertain areas as compared to NSP inmates. Because of the way that the plaintiffs framed \nthe second amended complaint, discovery proceeded with NSP as the only comparison \ninstitution. In May 1990, after months of discovery, the plaintiffs sought leave to file a third \namended complaint broadening the comparison group and alleging that NCW inmates were \nsimilarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services to all male inmates in the \nNebraska system. The magistrate judge denied the plaintiffs' motion, concluding that \nbroadening the comparison group at such a late date would prejudice the defendants \nbecause twenty-nine depositions involving both lay and expert witnesses had already been \ntaken and the witnesses were asked to compare conditions at NCW only to those at NSP. \nThe magistrate judge also reasoned that the plaintiffs had been warned in April 1989 to \nspecify to which institutions they wanted to compare programs and services at NCW. The \ndistrict court agreed with the magistrate judge and thus limited the plaintiffs' comparison \ngroup to NSP. \nThe third amended complaint stated several claims. For purposes of this appeal, the only \nrelevant claim is the plaintiffs' claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that the Department \ndiscriminates against the plaintiffs on the basis of sex as to prison programs and services in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Specifically, the plaintiffs \nalleged that, compared to male inmates at NSP, inmates at NCW receive inferior \n\"vocational, educational and employment opportunities and programs, rehabilitation \nprograms, exercise and recreational programs and facilities, visiting privileges, legal \nprograms, medical, dental and psychological services, and treatment associated with \nsecurity classifications.\" I App. at 60. The plaintiffs named as defendants on the equal \nprotection claim are Frank Gunter, former director of the Department; Harold Clarke, current \ndirector of the Department; Victor Lofgreen, former superintendent of NCW; Larry Tewes, \nformer superintendent of NCW; and Larry Wayne, current superintendent of NCW. \nAfter the plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint, the defendants moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted partial summary judgment to the defendants, but found \nthat there were genuine issues of material fact as to several of the plaintiffs' claims, \nincluding the equal protection claim. 730*730 The district court bifurcated the trial into a \nliability phase and a remedial phase. The liability phase proceeded to trial on the plaintiffs' \nsurviving claims in July 1992. After a four-week trial, the district court found Gunter and \n\nClarke liable[1] for violating the plaintiffs' equal protection rights in over a dozen different \nways relating to the programs in the challenged areas. \nIn June 1993, the district court certified three controlling questions of law relating to the \nplaintiffs' equal protection claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). The controlling questions of law \ninclude: \n[1]. Did the court correctly determine that the female inmates at the Nebraska Center for \nWomen are similarly situated to the male inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary for \npurposes of the Equal Protection Clause regarding the programs and services challenged \nby the plaintiffs? \n[2]. Did the court correctly determine that \"heightened scrutiny\" as opposed to \"rational \nbasis\" scrutiny is the proper level of scrutiny to judge the equal protection claims of the \nfemale inmates at the Nebraska Center for Women and, if so, did the court correctly apply \n\"heightened scrutiny\" to the facts? \n[3]. Did the court correctly conclude that the Equal Protection Clause requires the State of \nNebraska to provide programs and services to female inmates at the Nebraska which are \n\"substantially equivalent\" to or in parity with the programs and services provided male \ninmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary and, if so, did the court correctly apply such \nconcepts to the facts? \nII App. at 512-13. We granted the defendants permission to file an interlocutory appeal \nunder § 1292(b). \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe defendants argue that the district court committed several legal errors in concluding \nthat they are liable for violating the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. Specifically, they assert \nthat the district court erred (1) in finding that the plaintiffs and NSP inmates are similarly \nsituated for purposes of prison programs and services, (2) in concluding that heightened \nscrutiny rather than deferential review under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, \n96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), applied to the plaintiffs' claim, and (3) in comparing programs at NSP \nand NCW on a program-by-program basis. We agree with the defendants that the plaintiffs \nand NSP inmates are not similarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services. \nThus, we reverse the district court's order finding the defendants liable and dismiss the \nplaintiffs' equal protection claim. \nA. The District Court's Opinion \nWe begin by summarizing the district court's opinion. The court began by discussing \nwhether to apply Turner rational basis review or heightened scrutiny to the plaintiffs' equal \nprotection claim. It concluded that heightened scrutiny was the proper test because \"there is \nno doubt that women are incarcerated at NCW because of their gender alone and not for \nsome other reason.\" Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Servs., 824 F.Supp. 1374, \n1388 (D.Neb.1993). \n\nThe court then determined that the plaintiffs are similarly situated to male inmates at NSP \nfor purposes of prison programs and services. First, it reasoned that the plaintiffs and NSP \ninmates are both prisoners incarcerated in Nebraska institutions. Second, the court found \nthat comparing programs at the two institutions was appropriate because the Department \nclassified NSP and NCW inmates as \"roughly comparable\" as to custody levels. Third, the \ncourt reasoned that the purposes of incarceration were the same for men and women. \nFourth, the court distinguished Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1103 (8th Cir.1990), cert. \ndenied, 501 U.S. 1209, 111 S.Ct. 2807, 115 L.Ed.2d 979 (1991), in which we held that NSP \nand NCW were not similarly situated for purposes of privacy rights because of different \nsecurity 731*731 concerns at the two institutions. Finally, the court concluded that the \nappropriate place to take into account differences between NSP and NCW was at the \nheightened scrutiny stage, and not at the similarly situated stage. \nThe court proceeded to compare programs and services at NCW with those at NSP on a \nprogram-by-program basis. It generally concluded that invidious sex discrimination existed \nwherever the plaintiffs receive a substantively inferior program or service as compared to \nNSP inmates, rejecting the reasons that the defendants proffered for the differences in \ntreatment. The court found that the plaintiffs suffered a \"substantial burden\" as to some \nnineteen programs and services and that the defendants had failed to show that such \ndiffering treatment was justified under heightened scrutiny. Thus, the court concluded, the \ndefendants violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. \nB. Equal Protection Analysis \nThe Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat similarly situated \npeople alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. \n3249, 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). Dissimilar treatment of dissimilarly situated persons \ndoes not violate equal protection. See Barket, Levy & Fine, Inc. v. St. Louis Thermal Energy \nCorp., 21 F.3d 237, 242 (8th Cir.1994). Thus, the first step in an equal protection case is \ndetermining whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that she was treated differently than \nothers who were similarly situated to her. See, e.g., Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, \n940-41 (5th Cir.1991). Absent a threshold showing that she is similarly situated to those \nwho allegedly receive favorable treatment, the plaintiff does not have a viable equal \nprotection claim. See id. at 941 (holding that black residents failed to state an equal \nprotection claim where they did not allege the existence of a similarly situated group of \nwhite residents who were treated differently). Thus, before we may reach the merits of their \nequal protection claim, we must determine if the plaintiffs and NSP inmates are similarly \nsituated. \nThe similarly situated inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiffs are similarly situated to \nanother group for purposes of the challenged government action. See More v. Farrier, 984 \nF.2d 269, 271 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 74, 126 L.Ed.2d 43 (1993). \nThus, because the similarly situated inquiry depends on what government action the \nplaintiffs are challenging, we must first precisely define the plaintiffs' claim. The third \namended complaint alleges that the Department provides the plaintiffs with programs and \nservices inferior to those that NSP inmates receive in twelve different areas. It does not \nallege, however, that NCW receives inadequate funding as compared to NSP or that the \ndefendants are responsible for the amount of funding that NCW receives. Thus, the \n\nplaintiffs do not claim that their allegedly inferior programs are a result of discriminatory \nfunding.[2] Because the complaint thus acknowledges that NCW receives sufficient funding, \nthe plaintiffs' claim must be that the Department made poor decisions at NCW with the \nlimited resources available as compared to the decisions it made at NSP. In other words, \nthe plaintiffs in essence claim that the Constitution requires the Department to allocate \nresources and select programming at NCW like it allocates resources and selects \nprogramming at NSP. \nIn light of the plaintiffs' claim, we hold that NCW inmates and NSP inmates are not similarly \nsituated for purposes of prison programs and services. First, it is important to understand \nhow different NSP and NCW are. Among Nebraska's five single-sex prisons, NCW houses \nthe fewest inmates. NSP, in contrast, houses about six times as many inmates as NCW. \nMoreover, the average length of inmate stay at NSP is two to three times as long as it is at \nNCW. On Nebraska's security scale of one to four, with level four being the least secure, \nNCW is classified as a level four institution, while NSP is classified as a level two institution. \nThe plaintiffs' witnesses also testified at trial that female inmates as a class have \nspecial 732*732 characteristics distinguishing them from male inmates, ranging from the fact \nthat they are more likely to be single parents with primary responsibility for child rearing to \nthe fact that they are more likely to be sexual or physical abuse victims. Male inmates, in \ncontrast, are more likely to be violent and predatory than female inmates. \nThus, the programs at NSP and NCW reflect separate sets of decisions based on entirely \ndifferent circumstances. When determining programming at an individual prison under the \nrestrictions of a limited budget, prison officials must make hard choices. They must balance \nmany considerations, ranging from the characteristics of the inmates at that prison to the \nsize of the institution, to determine the optimal mix of programs and \nservices. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85, 107 S.Ct. at 2259-60. Program priorities thus differ \nfrom prison to prison, depending on innumerable variables that officials must take into \naccount. In short, NSP and NCW are different institutions with different inmates each \noperating with limited resources to fulfill different specific needs. See Timm, 917 F.2d at \n1103. Thus, whether NCW lacks one program that NSP has proves almost nothing. \nIndeed, as between any two prisons, there will always be stark differences in programming. \nAssuming that all prisons start with adequate yet limited funding — as we must here, \nbecause the plaintiffs do not claim that NCW is subject to discriminatory funding — officials \nwill calibrate programming differently in each prison, emphasizing in one prison programs \nthat they de-emphasize in others. Thus, female inmates can always point out certain ways \nin which male prisons are \"better\" than theirs, just as male inmates can always point \nout other ways in which female prisons are \"better\" than theirs.[3] See Bills v. Dahm, No. \n4:CV93-3108 (D.Neb. Jan. 12, 1994), appeal docketed, No. 94-1300 (8th Cir. Feb. 2, 1994) \n(appeal of district court decision denying qualified immunity to Nebraska prison officials in \nmale inmate's action alleging that he was denied equal protection because NCW inmates \nare allowed overnight visits from their children but inmates at Lincoln Correctional Center \nare not) (argued June 6, 1994). Comparing an isolated number of selected programs at \nNSP and NCW is thus a futile exercise. At bottom, using an inter-prison program \ncomparison to analyze equal protection claims improperly assumes that the Constitution \nrequires all prisons to have similar program priorities and to allocate resources similarly. \nAlthough the comparison between programs at NSP and those at NCW is not legally \n\nirrelevant, it is sufficiently attenuated that we believe it taints an analysis of whether the \nDepartment violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. Cf. Timm, 917 F.2d at \n1103 (holding that NSP and NCW are not similarly situated for purposes of privacy rights \nbecause of differences in security concerns between the two prisons). \nMoreover, the Supreme Court's Turner decision counsels against holding that the plaintiffs \nand NSP inmates are similarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services. The \nplaintiffs' claim challenges the day-to-day administrative decisions of prison officials. \nIn Turner, the Court explained that \"`courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly \nurgent problems of prison administration.'\" 482 U.S. at 84, 107 S.Ct. at \n2259 (quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d \n224 (1974)). Because courts have little expertise in the \"inordinately difficult\" task of running \nprisons, courts should accord a high degree of deference to prison authorities. Id. at 85, 107 \nS.Ct. at 2259-60. Subjecting prison officials' decisions to close scrutiny \"distort[s] the \ndecisionmaking process\" and \"seriously hamper[s] [officials'] ability to ... adopt innovative \nsolutions to the intractable problems of prison administration.\" Id. at 89, 107 S.Ct. at 2262. \nAnalyzing this case using a program comparison between NSP and NCW, however, places \ndozens of substantive administrative prison decisions under close judicial scrutiny and \nsubjects them to after-the-fact second-guessing by a federal 733*733 court. Moreover, \ncomparing programs at NSP and NCW places the burden on prison officials to explain \ndecisions that resulted from the complicated interplay of many variables — some of which \nwere beyond their control — and thus are not susceptible to ready explanation. \nFinally, prison officials would be far less willing to experiment and innovate with programs at \nan individual institution knowing that a federal court could impose liability on the basis of a \nprogram comparison. Indeed, inmates would suffer because officials would likely provide \neach institution with the bare constitutional minimum of programs and services to avoid the \nthreat of equal protection liability. Cf. Bills, slip op. at 1-3. Thus, comparing programs at \nNSP and NCW results in precisely the type of federal court interference with and \"micro-\nmanagement\" of prisons that Turner condemned. \nThus, we hold that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs and NSP inmates are not similarly \nsituated for purposes of prison programs and services. Differences between challenged \nprograms at the two prisons are virtually irrelevant because so many variables affect the \nmix of programming that an institution has. Further, comparing programs improperly results \nin federal court scrutiny of prison officials' substantive administrative decisions. In short, \ncomparing programs at NSP to those at NCW is like the proverbial comparison of apples to \noranges. Thus, as their complaint is framed, the plaintiffs have failed to make the requisite \nthreshold showing that they are similarly situated to the group that they claim receives \nfavorable treatment. For this reason, the plaintiffs have not suffered an equal protection \nviolation because their programs in twelve areas are allegedly inferior to those that male \ninmates at NSP receive. See Barket, Levy & Fine, Inc., 21 F.3d at 242 (\"`Different treatment \nof dissimilarly situated persons does not violate the equal protection clause[.]'\" (quoting E & \nT Realty v. Strickland, 830 F.2d 1107, 1109 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 961, \n108 S.Ct. 1225, 99 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988))).[4] \nThe dissent would hold that NSP inmates and NCW inmates are similarly situated for \npurposes of prison programs and services and that an equal protection violation exists \n\nwherever NCW receives an inferior program as compared to NSP. Even assuming the \ninmates are similarly situated, however, that is merely the beginning of the analysis. A \nfundamental principle of equal protection is that the Constitution only prohibits intentional or \npurposeful discrimination by the state. Personnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, \n274, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293-94, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979). To prevail on a sex discrimination \nclaim, a plaintiff must show that the state discriminated against her because of her \nsex. Id. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296. Both the district court and the dissent make the erroneous \nassumption that any inferior programs that NCW inmates receive are necessarily a result of \nintentional sex discrimination. \n734*734 Indeed, the district court made no findings on whether the plaintiffs carried their \nburden of proving intentional discrimination nor did it mention that the plaintiffs carried this \nburden. Rather, the court generally shifted the burden to the defendants to justify \ndifferences in prison programming on sex-neutral grounds and thus disprove discriminatory \npurpose. See, e.g., Klinger, 824 F.Supp. at 1419 (holding that equal protection violation \nexisted where NCW lacked 24-hour medical services even though defendants proffered \nevidence that neither the Hastings Correctional Center nor the Omaha Correctional Center \n— two all-male institutions in the Nebraska system — had such services either). The district \ncourt's analysis effectively relieved the plaintiffs of their burden of persuasion on the \nultimate issue of discriminatory purpose. \nLikewise, the dissent and the district court both erroneously assume that this is a case \ninvolving a facial gender classification. There is simply no Nebraska statute or policy that \ndistinguishes on its face between men and women as to prison programs. Indeed, the \nstatutes relating to programming in Nebraska prisons are facially neutral. See Neb.Rev.Stat. \n§ 83-901 et seq. There is of course a facial classification in Nebraska prisons in that male \nand female inmates are segregated by institution, with the exception of the two integrated \ninstitutions. The plaintiffs, however, do not challenge this classification. The dissent and the \ndistrict court apparently reason that if women are sent to NCW because of their sex that the \nprograms they receive are necessarily based on their sex. \nThis conclusion is unwarranted. For example, NSP has 24-hour medical service available; \ntwo other all-male institutions and NCW lack 24-hour medical service. There is clearly no \n\"facial gender classification\" regarding 24-hour medical service where both male and female \nprisoners are in the group deprived of the program. Thus, determining whether the plaintiffs \nreceive inferior programs because of their sex or for some other reason requires looking \nbeyond the fact that female prisoners are segregated from men and examining the reasons \nbehind the defendants' programming decisions. For this reason, Feeney controls and the \ndistrict court erred in failing to make findings on discriminatory intent. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's order finding the defendants liable \nfor violating the plaintiffs' equal protection rights and dismiss the plaintiffs' equal protection \nclaim.[5] \nMcMILLIAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting. \n\nI respectfully dissent. The majority opinion artificially manipulates the Equal Protection \nClause requirement of \"similarly situated\" and misapplies Fourteenth Amendment standards \nat the expense of female inmates incarcerated at NCW. \nThe majority opinion errs in concluding that male inmates incarcerated at NSP are not \nsimilarly situated to female inmates incarcerated at NCW for purposes of comparing \ninstitutional programs and services.[1] On a general level, the female inmates at NCW and \nmale inmates at NSP are similarly situated for purposes of comparing the programs and \nservices offered to them because both groups of inmates are confined by the State of \nNebraska as a result of a criminal conviction. More importantly, they are similarly situated \nbecause the State of Nebraska and the Department of Corrections view the purpose of \nincarceration to be the same for all inmates regardless of gender: to enable inmates to seek \nreform within the institution and rehabilitate themselves to function in society as law-abiding \ncitizens. Irrespective of gender, the prison system strives to prevent revolving-door \nrecidivism. A close and 735*735 critical nexus exists between inmate rehabilitation and the \nprovision of recreational opportunities and educational and vocational training programs and \nservices to inmates within the prison system. It is unquestionable, with respect to the goal of \nrehabilitation, that female inmates at NCW and male inmates at NSP are similarly situated \nfor purposes of comparing programs and services. \nFemale inmates at NCW are also similarly situated to male inmates at NSP for purposes of \nprograms and services because they are equally as capable of participating in, and \nbenefitting from, the recreational, educational and vocational opportunities offered to their \nmale counterparts. See More v. Farrier, 984 F.2d 269, 271 (8th Cir.1992) (concluding \nwheelchair-bound inmates were similarly situated to ambulatory inmates for purposes of \nchallenging denial of in-cell cable television because they were as capable of participating \nin, and benefitting from, the challenged program). The female inmates incarcerated at NCW \nare for the most part poor, undereducated, and lack the vocational training necessary to \nbecome self-supporting. The female inmates' gender places them at the bottom of the list of \nthe unemployed and unemployables in this country. In other words, gender itself will \ndisadvantage the female inmates as they attempt to enter or re-enter the workforce. Clearly, \ntheir need for educational and vocational training to obtain employment and become self-\nsufficient upon release is equal to that of males at NSP, who are also in general poor, \nundereducated, and lack vocational training. All released ex-offenders, irrespective of \ngender, encounter enormous difficulty in securing employment. Plaintiffs are entitled to the \nsame opportunity as their male counterparts to learn marketable skills which will enable \nthem to obtain employment upon release from prison. \nFurther, the district court found that NCW and NSP house inmates with comparable custody \nclassifications: \n[S]ince NCW spans the security continuum and houses maximum custody inmates, and \nsince NSP also houses maximum custody inmates, it is likely that the court will be \ncomparing populations, aside from gender, which are classified as roughly comparable by \nthe State of Nebraska. In this regard, since there is no segregation between minimum \ncustody inmates and maximum custody inmates at NCW, minimum custody inmates receive \nthe same type of treatment as maximum custody inmates. Thus, it is not inconsistent to \ntreat both institutions as having roughly comparable populations. Stated another way, \n\nfemale minimum custody inmates are treated essentially the same as female maximum \ncustody inmates. Therefore, if it is appropriate to compare institutions housing female \nmaximum custody inmates with institutions housing male maximum custody inmates, then \nthe existence of the lower custody status inmates at NCW is irrelevant. \nKlinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Corrections, 824 F.Supp. 1374, 1389 (D.Neb.1993) (Klinger). \nNonetheless, the majority opinion holds that \"NCW inmates and NSP inmates are not \nsimilarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services\" because of different \ncharacteristics of male and female inmates and different circumstances surrounding their \nincarceration. Maj. op. at 731-32. The reasons cited by the majority opinion for the \npurported dissimilarity of male and female inmates include factors such as the shorter \naverage length of inmate stay at NCW (13 months) as compared to NSP (54 months). A \nclose examination of the record belies using length of inmate stay as a ground for \ndifferentiating between NCW and NSP for purposes of comparing programs and \nservices. Regardless of length of stay, male inmates at NSP, unlike their female \ncounterparts at NCW, are afforded the opportunity to participate in a wide gamut of \nvocational programs and enroll in post-secondary educational courses that can ultimately \nlead to a college degree. As the district court concluded, \"it is difficult to understand the \nrationale for denying females [these opportunities] based upon a factor that was not \nemployed for males.\" Klinger, 824 F.Supp. at 1401. No evidence was presented that NSP \nprovided the superior programs and services only to \"long-time\" male inmates or that, \nconversely, NSP's \"short-time\" male inmates did not benefit from the training. \nThe 736*736 \"length-of-stay\" argument is further belief by the district court's observation that: \nthe difference in \"length of stay\" between NCW inmates and \"medium\" custody NSP \ninmates was small. The \"medium\" custody male group at NSP was probably \"most like\" the \nfemales at NCW. For example, in June, 1990, (Ex. 1385), the data showed: (a) inmates \nstaying 24 months or less: NSP (medium) 70.7% vs. NCW 82.4%; (b) inmates staying 18 \nmonths or less: NSP (medium) 61.5% vs. NCW 74.3%; (c) inmates staying 12 months or \nless: NSP (medium) 50.6% vs. NCW 66.9%. Even if one looks at the maximum custody \ninmates at NSP, one out of five inmates stayed 12 months or less. Id. Indeed, nearly 40% of \nthe NSP maximum custody inmates stayed 24 months or less. Since college course work \nwas offered to these male inmates regardless of \"length of stay,\" it seems fair to conclude \nthat \"length of stay\" was not a factor in offering college work at NSP. \nId. \nThe majority opinion also finds dissimilarity because \"[a]mong Nebraska's five single-sex \nprisons, NCW houses the fewest inmates ... NSP, in contrast, houses about six times as \nmany inmates as NCW.\" Maj. op. at 731. The majority opinion's analysis is driven by the \nfact that the Department is operating under \"the restrictions of a limited budget ... and the \ndifference ... [in] institution size\" of NCW and NSP make them dissimilar for purposes of \ncomparing programs and services. Maj. op. at 731-32. \nIn Bukhari v. Hutto, 487 F.Supp. 1162 (E.D.Va.1980) (Bukhari), the plaintiff argued that her \nconditions of confinement in an all-female prison were inferior to those of male inmates in \nan all-male institution. The court recognized that the defendants \"must deal with the fiscal \n\nreality that providing for a wide range of programs for a smaller number of prisoners entails \na greater cost.\" Id. at 1172. Nonetheless, the court opined that \"such seemingly practical \nconsiderations may not be used to `justify official inaction or unwillingness to operate a \nprison system in a constitutional manner.'\" Id. (citations omitted); see also Califano v. \nGoldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 217, 97 S.Ct. 1021, 1032, 51 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977) (savings in time, \nmoney and effort do not justify gender-based discrimination). \nIn West v. Virginia Dep't of Corrections, 847 F.Supp. 402 (W.D.Va.1994) (West), the \nplaintiff, a female inmate at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, raised an equal \nprotection clause challenge to the establishment of a pilot boot camp program, which \noffered academic education, vocational assessment and life skills training, at a male-only \nprison, while no such pilot program existed at the female-only prison. In response to the \ndefendants' argument that the program in the men's prison was justified because of limited \nresources, and because problems were more pressing in male prisons, and it was more \ncost-effective to address those problems, the court held \"[i]f defendants' argument were \ncarried to its logical extension, then the same argument could be used to deny women \ninmates the opportunity for education, vocational training or rehabilitation. Surely such an \ninequitable distribution of resources is not contemplated by the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\" Id. at 407. \nIt is well-settled that financial hardship is not a defense to sex discrimination in \nprisons. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 633, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1330-31, 22 L.Ed.2d \n600 (1969) (while states have a valid interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of programs, it \nmay not accomplish such a purpose by invidious distinctions between classes of citizens). \nCost-driven differences in institution size and inmate length of stay do not constitutionally \njustify limiting NCW inmates' training to domestics and other \"women's\" occupations such \nas \"clerical arts\" and homemaking, providing inferior inmate pay, pre-employment training \nand prison law libraries, while denying them post-secondary education or vocational \ncourses that could lead to a college degree or college credit, and providing NSP inmates \nwith training in higher-paying, more technical, and more varied occupations, more \nsophisticated and accessible prison law libraries, and educational and vocational courses \nleading to attainment of a college degree or college credit. \n\"To be `similarly situated,' groups need not be identical in makeup, they need only \nshare 737*737 commonalities that merit similar treatment.\" Betts v. McCaughtry, 827 \nF.Supp. 1400, 1405 (W.D.Wis.1993). In the present case, female inmates at NCW do in fact \n\"share commonalities\" with male inmates at NSP that merit similar treatment in terms of \ntheir right and ability to receive educational and vocational programs and services. NCW \ninmates are equally as capable of participating in, and benefitting from, the academic, \nvocational and rehabilitative opportunities offered to the NSP inmates. NCW and NSP \ninmates are both incarcerated as the result of a criminal conviction, and the Department \nviews the purpose of incarceration for both classes of inmates to be the same regardless of \ngender. Further, NCW and NSP reflect comparable custody classifications, and the record \nreveals absolutely no evidence that concerns for institutional security justify offering \ndifferent programs and services at the respective institutions. \"On the contrary, if anything, \nthe relative lack of security concerns at NCW, compared with NSP, makes at least some of \nthe differences in programs inexplicable if based upon security concerns.\" Klinger, 824 \nF.Supp. at 1390. Nonetheless, due to their smaller numbers, predominantly non-violent, \n\nnon-predatory nature, and the fact that they are generally incarcerated for less serious \noffenses and for shorter time periods than their male counterparts, the majority opinion \nchooses to sanction constitutionally unequal treatment of female inmates at NCW and to \nneglect the rights guaranteed to them by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. The fact of incarceration and the particular exigencies of prison administration \ncannot justify programs and services provided female inmates that are markedly inferior to \nthose provided male inmates. \nThe majority opinion further confuses basic tenets of constitutional law in holding fatal to the \nplaintiffs' claim of gender discrimination the district court's failure to make \"findings on \nwhether the plaintiffs carried their burden of proving intentional discrimination\" and failure to \n\"mention that the plaintiffs carried this burden.\" Maj. op. at 734. Along this same vein, the \nmajority opinion mistakenly cites Personnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274, \n99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293-94, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979) (Feeney), to support its holding. \nEqual protection clause analysis distinguishes between facial classifications and non-facial \nclassifications. Non-facial classifications, such as the veteran-preference policy at issue \nin Feeney, are subject to heightened scrutiny only upon proof that they have a disparate \nimpact on a protected group and are motivated by a discriminatory intent. Id. at 272-74, 99 \nS.Ct. at 2292-94. By contrast, overt gender classifications of similarly situated people, such \nas the gender-based prison policy in the present case, are subjected to the heightened \nscrutiny set forth in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 \n(1976), under which the government bears the burden of establishing that the gender \nclassification has an important purpose and that the relationship between purpose and \nclassification is substantial. Intentional discrimination can be presumed where the \ngovernment fails to meet this burden. In Feeney, the Supreme Court opined that purposeful \ndiscrimination is \"`the condition that offends the Constitution,'\" 442 U.S. at 274, 99 S.Ct. at \n2293 (citations omitted), at least where a covert or overt gender-based classification \nis not in issue. In other words, \"purposeful discrimination is the subject of the \ninquiry absent a discernible, non-neutral legislative or administrative classification subject to \nthe important governmental interest/substantial relation test.\" Marshall v. Kirkland, 602 F.2d \n1282, 1299 (8th Cir.1979) (emphasis added). Cases involving an overt or covert gender-\nbased prison policy do not require explicit findings of intentional or purposeful \ndiscrimination, but rather are correctly analyzed by employing the important governmental \ninterest/substantial relation test to implicitly establish discriminatory intent. See, \ne.g., West, 847 F.Supp. at 405-07; McCoy v. Nevada Dep't of Prisons, 776 F.Supp. 521, \n523 (D.Nev.1991); Dawson v. Kendrick, 527 F.Supp. 1252, 1372 (S.D.W.Va. \n1981); Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. at 1171.[2] The 738*738 existence of intentional discrimination is \nintertwined with the heightened scrutiny framework. \"[E]vidence that invidious discrimination \n— the ultimate object of heightened scrutiny — produced or underlies the classification at \nhand would doom the [contested] prisoner policy [by] demonstrating its lack of direct and \nsubstantial relation to an important governmental interest.\" Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d \n1450, 1459 (D.C.Cir. 1989) (emphasis added). \nThe majority opinion correctly notes that the female inmates of NCW do not challenge the \nclassification by \"Nebraska prisons in that male and female inmates are segregated by \ninstitution.\" Maj. op. at 734. However, the majority opinion then erroneously concludes that, \nbecause the gender-based segregation of inmates is not directly challenged, a facially \n\nneutral policy is at issue, and Feeney and its requirement of express findings of \ndiscriminatory intent must control. \nPlaintiffs, as noted above, do not challenge the policy of incarcerating men and women in \nseparate institutions. They do assert, however, \"that the policy of housing men and women \nin separate institutions has been applied in such a manner as to relegate women to an \ninferior opportunity to take advantage of academic, vocational, and training \nopportunities.\" Canterino v. Wilson, 546 F.Supp. 174, 211 (W.D.Ky.1982), as amended, 562 \nF.Supp. 106, (1983) aff'd, 875 F.2d 862 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 991, 110 S.Ct. \n539, 107 L.Ed.2d 536 (1989). To state otherwise, the consequence of the gender-based \nprison segregation system in Nebraska is a gross inferiority in a host of opportunities for \nfemale inmates at NCW as compared to males at NSP. As such, Nebraska must show that \nthe disparate treatment of female inmates is substantially related to an important \ngovernmental interest. \"Where the actual consequence of a seemingly harmless \nclassification reveals disparate treatment, there is ample justification to treat the \nclassification and its consequence together in order to determine the `fit' between this end \nresult and the [governmental interest].\" Id. 546 F.Supp. at 211 (quoting Glover v. \nJohnson, 478 F.Supp. 1075, 1080 (E.D.Mich.1979) (Glover)). \nIn the present case, the district court astutely concluded that a facially gender-based policy \nexisted: \n[T]here is no doubt that women are incarcerated at NCW because of their gender and not \nfor some other reason. There is only one prison for women in the State of Nebraska. \nWhether a woman is convicted of writing bad checks or of murder, she will find herself at \nNCW when sentenced to prison. Men, on the other hand, could be sent to a variety of \ninstitutions depending upon a variety of penological goals — from security to programming. \nAs a consequence, despite the fact that nongender-related reasons may exist to justify \ntreating female prisoners differently from male prisoners, the fact remains that female \nprisoners, as a result of their gender alone, can receive only the programs available at \nNCW. Therefore, if the programming at NCW is comparatively inferior to programs at NSP, \nthe female recipients may receive poor programming because of their gender and not for \nsome nongender-related reason. \nKlinger, 824 F.Supp. at 1388 (emphasis added); accord Bukhari, 487 F.Supp. at 1171 (sex-\nbased, disparate treatment analysis applied to plaintiff's claim, inter alia, that the limited \nopportunity for education for female maximum security prisoners at all-female prison \ncompared to those opportunities for male maximum security prisoners at major male \nprisons violated equal protection clause); Batton v. North Carolina, 501 F.Supp. 1173, 1176 \n(E.D.N.C.1980) (where female inmates were incarcerated at all-female institution, rather \nthan any other prison operated by the Department, solely because of their gender, court \napplied facial-classification analysis to female inmates' equal protection claim that they \nallegedly received vocational training opportunities only in low-paying, traditionally female \njobs while male inmates 739*739 were afforded training in a wide variety of \noccupations); Glover, 478 F.Supp. at 1080 (given the inferior programs offered at female \nprison, the practical effect of housing women separately is to deny them access to the \nrange and quality of programs offered male inmates based solely on their gender).[3] \n\nIn the present case, the district court correctly reasoned that the offering of educational, \nvocational, and recreational programs only in the men's prison, without offering equivalent \nprograms in the women's prison, constituted a denial of benefits of a program because of \nsex. In a voluminous and comprehensive opinion, the district court weighed and analyzed in \ngreat detail the abundance of evidence which showed that the gender-based allocation of \nprograms and services sprang from indifference, bias, and stereotypical notions of women's \nrole in society. Contrary to the majority opinion's assertion, the district court did not assume \nany inferior program or service at NCW was the product of intentional discrimination. \nRather, the framework employed for determining whether an Equal Protection Clause \nviolation existed was to determine \nwhether there are programs (means) afforded (in quantity or quality) to male inmates at \nNSP but not female inmates at NCW which place a \"substantial burden\" on female inmates \n(disparity); if so, ascertain whether there is an important governmental objective (objective) \nwhich underlies the \"means\"; if so, finally decide whether the \"means\" chosen to further the \ngovernmental \"objective\" are directly and substantially related to the \"objective\" (relationship \nof means to objective) such that the \"disparity\" may be overlooked. \nKlinger, 824 F.Supp. at 1391. \nIn short, the district court correctly considered whether or not the facially gender-based \nallocation of programs and services constituted unconstitutional discrimination as defined by \nsuch leading cases as Craig v. Boren and Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. \n718, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1981) (Hogan). By analyzing whether or not the \nDepartment of Corrections' unequal allocation of programs and services responded \nsubstantially to an important governmental interest, the district court completed its task of \ndetermining whether or not invidious discrimination existed. The district court did not \nimpermissibly shift \"the burden to the defendants to justify differences in prison \nprogramming on sex-neutral grounds and thus disprove discriminatory purpose,\" as argued \nby the majority opinion, Maj. op. at 734, but rather, the district court correctly required the \ndefendants to \"carry the burden of showing an `exceedingly persuasive justification' for the \nclassification.\" Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724, 102 S.Ct. at 3336 (citing Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 \nU.S. 455, 461, 101 S.Ct. 1195, 1199, 67 L.Ed.2d 428 (1981); Feeney, 442 U.S. at 273, 99 \nS.Ct. at 2293). As noted above, the district court carefully reviewed the defendants' \nevidence and found that the defendants failed to show any exceedingly persuasive \njustification for the sex-based difference in treatment. \nI also agree with the district court's well-reasoned analysis regarding the remaining issues \npresented on appeal, and, accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the district court in all \nrespects. \n[*] Arnold, Chief Judge, McMillian and Beam, Circuit Judges, would grant the suggestion for rehearing en banc. \n[1] The court found Gunter liable in his personal capacity and Clarke liable in his official capacity. It also concluded, \nhowever, that Lofgreen, Tewes, and Wayne were not liable for the equal protection violations. For convenience, the \nopinion will refer to Gunter and Clarke as \"the defendants.\" \n[2] Nor could they make such a claim. Nebraska spent more money per capita on NCW than any other adult prison in \nits system. See IV App. at 739. \n\n[3] Indeed, the district court found that in several of the areas that the plaintiffs challenged, NCW inmates had better \nprograms than NSP inmates. See, e.g., Klinger, 824 F.Supp. at 1418 (daily access to physicians), 1423-24 \n(substance abuse treatment), 1430 (child visitation programs). \n[4] That the plaintiffs and NSP inmates are not similarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services does \nnot mean that female inmates are foreclosed from bringing equal protection claims challenging the state's treatment \nof them. As it is set forth in the complaint, the plaintiffs' claim here requires an inappropriate comparison of programs \nat NSP and NCW in twelve different areas. Some comparisons of the Department's respective treatment of male and \nfemale inmates, however, are appropriate. For instance, male and female inmates are similarly situated for purposes \nof the process by which the Department makes programming decisions. That is, instead of alleging differences in \nprograms between prisons, a proper equal protection claim may allege differences in the process by which program \ndecisions were made at the prisons. \nFor instance, if the Department selected vocational programs at men's prisons based on inmate surveys, but \nunilaterally selected such programs at NCW without consulting the inmates at all, NCW inmates would be able to \nmake the requisite threshold showing that they were treated differently than others similarly situated. Thus, male and \nfemale inmates are similarly situated at the beginning of the decisionmaking process, where infinite intervening \nvariables have not yet excessively tainted the comparison between prisons nor are officials' substantive \nadministrative decisions yet at issue. We need not elaborate on the details of pleading and proving such a claim here. \nSuffice it to say that the plaintiffs have not pleaded such a claim. \n[5] In light of our holding, we need not address the defendants' claim that Gunter is entitled to qualified immunity, \nalthough we believe it may have some merit. \n[1] The challenged programs and services encompass employment and economic concerns, educational and \nvocational training courses, concerns regarding the law library, medical and dental services, recreational \nopportunities, and concerns regarding visitation. \n[2] Eighth Circuit analysis is in accord. See, e.g., Navedo v. Preisser, 630 F.2d 636, 641 (8th Cir. 1980) (state statute \nwhich prohibited males over twenty-five years old from engaging in sexual intercourse with females sixteen years old, \nwithout punishing female over twenty-five years of age for engaging in sexual intercourse with males sixteen years \nold violated equal protection clause \"[b]ecause the state has failed to show that its gender-based classification \nsubstantially furthers the [governmental objectives of] prevention of physical injury, emotional trauma, or pregnancy \ncaused by sexual intercourse with an older person\"). \n[3] As observed by the court in Glover: \n[A] female in the State of Michigan will be sent to Huron Valley by reason of her gender alone, and will necessarily \nhave access only to these programs currently available at that location. A male prisoner, on the other hand, can be \nclassified or later transferred to a wide variety of prison facilities in the State and will have access to more program \nopportunities than his female counterpart. I conclude, therefore, that because of these limitations women as a group \nare treated differently than men as a group, and that these differences in treatment are directly related to gender. \nGlover, 478 F.Supp. at 1078. \n ",

Nebraska. \nDecember 15, 1995. \n1330*1330 1331*1331 Gail S. Perry and Stephanie F. Stacy, Baylor, Evnen, Curtiss, Grimit & \nWitt, Lincoln, NE, for plaintiffs. \nDon Stenberg, Attorney General, Laurie Smith Camp, Deputy Attorney General, Lincoln, \nNE, for defendants. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nKOPF, District Judge. \nPending before the court is Plaintiffs' application for attorney fees and expenses (filing 723), \nin support of which Plaintiffs have filed numerous affidavits and exhibits (filing 724). After \nconsideration of Plaintiffs' application and supporting evidence and Defendants' response \nthereto, I shall award Plaintiffs $37,084.92 in attorney fees and $3,557.52 in expenses. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural History \nThis case involved female inmates at the Nebraska Center for Women (NCW) who filed suit \nclaiming inequitable treatment in programs and services as compared with male inmates at \nthe Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP). After a month-long trial, I issued an opinion, Klinger \nv. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Services, 824 F.Supp. 1374 1332*1332 (D.Neb.1993) \n(Klinger I), which found: (1) when examined by reference to the \"heightened scrutiny\" \nstandard, female inmates at NCW were discriminated against because of their sex in many \n(but not all) program and service offerings as compared to male inmates at NSP, in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, id. at 1390-1431; (2) based \nupon the same NCW/NSP comparison which had been used for the equal protection \nanalysis, Plaintiffs established a violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (Title IX), because NCW did not offer regularly scheduled \nprerelease programs while NSP did, id. at 1431-1434; (3) the segregation and orientation \ninmates at NCW were completely and systematically denied their right of access to the \ncourts under the Fourteenth Amendment until January, 1989, because those inmates had \n\nno physical access to the law library or assistance from a trained legal aide, and NCW \ngeneral population inmates were completely and systematically denied the same right prior \nto January, 1989, because those inmates did not have access to a trained legal aide and \nthe law library itself was not adequate, id. at 1434-1438; and (4) NCW's medical and dental \npolicies did not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation, id. at 1438-1440. \nOn interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \nconcluded that the plaintiffs, NCW inmates, were not similarly situated to male inmates at \nNSP for purposes of prison programs and services; reversed Klinger I insofar as it found \nDefendants liable for violating Plaintiffs' equal protection rights; and dismissed Plaintiffs' \nequal protection claim. Klinger v. Department of Corrections, 31 F.3d 727, 729 & 731 (8th \nCir.1994) (Klinger II). Plaintiffs' petition for writ of certiorari was denied in Klinger v. \nNebraska Dep't of Corrections, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1177, 130 L.Ed.2d 1130 (1995). \nBecause judgment had not yet been entered and trial had been bifurcated between liability \nand remedy, I revised Klinger I pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) in Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't \nof Correctional Services, 887 F.Supp. 1281 (D.Neb.1995) (Klinger III). In Klinger III, I \nreversed my decision regarding Title IX in Klinger I because my Title IX findings in Klinger \nI were premised upon my determination that one could profitably compare NSP with NCW, \na determination explicitly reversed by the Eighth Circuit in Klinger II. Thus, I concluded \nin Klinger III that Plaintiffs failed to prove that NCW inmates were denied educational \nopportunities on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. Klinger III, 887 F.Supp. at 1287. \nAfter a bench trial on the issue of damages regarding my previous finding that former NCW \nsuperintendents Victor Lofgreen and Larry Tewes were liable for the above-described \naccess-to-the-courts violations, Klinger I at 1383 & 1452, I issued an opinion in Klinger v. \nNebraska Dep't of Correctional Services, 902 F.Supp. 1036 (D.Neb.1995) (Klinger IV). I \nawarded $1.00 in nominal damages to the NCW general population inmates, recognizing \nthat Plaintiffs were unable to show that Lofgreen and Tewes caused actual or compensatory \ndamages, that presumed damages have not been recognized in this type of case, that a \ndollar value could not be assigned to the harm Plaintiffs suffered, and that punitive damages \nwere not warranted. Id., at 1043-44. I also awarded $1.00 in nominal damages to the NCW \nsegregation and orientation inmates, again declining to award compensatory, actual, \npresumed, and punitive damages. Id., at 1045-46. I further ordered the filing of the \napplication for attorney fees, which is the matter now before me. \nB. Application for Attorney Fees and Expenses \nPlaintiffs' application for attorney fees and expenses (filing 723) requests a base lodestar \nattorney fee of $529,784.50 and $50,821.71 in expenses. The application is supported by \nthe following evidentiary materials: affidavit of Robert T. Grimit and exhibit; affidavit of Gail \nS. Perry and attached exhibits; affidavit of Stephanie F. Stacy; affidavit of David A. Dudley; \naffidavit of Susan L. Blackwell and attached exhibits; affidavit of Victor E. Covalt, III; affidavit \nof David R. Buntain; and 1333*1333 affidavit of Vincent Powers.[1] \n1. Request for Attorney Fees \n\nPlaintiffs' request for attorney fees in the amount of $529,784.50 was calculated by \nPlaintiffs' lawyers in the following manner. \nTotal time billed to this case by lawyers, law clerks, paralegals, and support staff— some 45 \nindividuals—from October 18, 1988, to October 31, 1995, was 9,591.6 hours. (Blackwell Aff. \n¶ 12(A) & Ex. K.) This sum was voluntarily reduced twice. First, the sum was reduced by \n1,098 hours to delete the work of non-primary timekeepers, such as lawyers who only \nworked sporadically on the case or clerical personnel. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 10 & 12(A)-(B) & \nExs. K, L.) While the time appearing on billing statements for all primary timekeepers[2] was \n8,493.6 (Blackwell Aff., Ex. L), this amount was reduced to 5,123.6 after the time entries for \nprimary timekeepers were divided into categories of 10 core legal activities such as \ndocument discovery, discovery disputes, settlement negotiations, depositions, and \nmotions/briefs. (Perry Aff. ¶ 22; Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 11 & Exs. A-J.) This reduction accounted \nfor duplication and removal from consideration of time spent on appeal (350.2 hours). \n(Blackwell Aff., Ex. M.) Time for telephone calls (216 hours), correspondence (177.4 hours), \nand time spent on preparation of the fee application (214.5 hours) was also excluded from \nthis initial hourly figure. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16, 17 & Exs. M, S.) \nThe \"lodestar\" was then determined by taking 5,123.6 hours for the 10 core legal activities \naccomplished by the primary time-keepers (Blackwell Aff., Ex. L) and adding 216 hours for \ntelephone calls, 177.4 hours for correspondence, and 214.5 hours for preparation of the fee \napplication. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16, 17 & Exs. M, S.) The total number of hours claimed to \nhave been reasonably expended on this case was 5,731.5. \nFor all tasks except telephone calls and correspondence, the hourly billing rate for each \nprimary timekeeper was then multiplied by the number of hours spent for that timekeeper. \n(Blackwell Aff., Exs. M, S.) These rates ranged from $150.00 per hour to $90.00 per hour \nfor lawyers, $50.00 per hour for the paralegal, and $35.00 per hour for the law clerks. (Id.) \nAn average hourly billing rate for all primary timekeepers of $105.00 per hour was multiplied \nby telephone and correspondence hours. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16.) \nThe total lodestar fee was thus calculated at $529,784.50 for 5,731.5 hours. (Blackwell Aff., \nEx. M.) This figure represents all work which counsel claim was reasonably done on the \ncase, excluding appeals. This figure does not represent work on the successful access-to-\nthe-courts claim only, as counsel argue they cannot break out the work done on the \nsuccessful claim only because the claims were so interrelated. (Perry Aff. ¶¶ 25-28.) \nHowever, counsel make a \"rough estimate\" that 20 percent of their time was spent on the \nsuccessful claim and closely related issues. (Perry Aff. ¶ 29.) \n2. Request for Expenses \nPlaintiffs also request $50,821.71 in expenses. This figure was calculated by dividing the \nentire original computerized billing statement (Blackwell Aff., Ex. P, at 397-472; summarized \nat Ex. Q) into seven general categories—collect calls from inmates, long distance charges, \nphotocopying, express mail, postage, Westlaw research, and deposition expenses. \n(Blackwell Aff., Ex. Q.) Telecopier expenses were not included, nor were other expenses \nnot fitting into the above seven categories. (Compare Blackwell Aff., Ex. P, at 397-\n472, with Ex. Q.) The firm's customary 20-cents-per-page charge for photocopying was \n\nreduced to 5 cents per copy, and the firm's usual markup for Westlaw research expenses \nwas not applied. (Blackwell Aff. ¶ 14.) The total figure reached for expenses in these seven \ncategories 1334*1334 was $21,160.03, to which was added Plaintiffs' expenses which \nformed the basis for their reimbursement from the Federal Practice Fund—expenses which \nmust be repaid in the event expenses are awarded in this court. (Perry Aff. ¶ 30; Blackwell \nAff., Ex. Q, at 3.) Plaintiffs calculate these Federal Practice Fund expenses as $29,661.68. \n(Blackwell Aff., Ex. Q, at 3 (subtracting expenses in seven categories from total expenses \nrequested); Ex. R (orders by Chief Judge Lyle E. Strom authorizing disbursement of \n$29,161.68 and $500 from Federal Practice Fund).) \nII. ANALYSIS \nA. Prevailing Party \nThis court has discretion to allow the \"prevailing party\" in this lawsuit a reasonable attorney \nfee as part of the costs. 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). \n[T]o qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the \nmerits of his claim.... [A] plaintiff \"prevails\" when actual relief on the merits of his claim \nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's \nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. \n.... \nA judgment for damages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies the \ndefendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of \nmoney he otherwise would not pay. \nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-13, 113 S.Ct. 566, 573-74, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). \nBecause \"the prevailing party inquiry does not turn on the magnitude of relief \nobtained,\" id. at 114, 113 S.Ct. at 574, it follows that \"a plaintiff who wins nominal damages \nis a prevailing party under § 1988.\" Id. at 112, 113 S.Ct. at 573. See also Milton v. Des \nMoines, Iowa, 47 F.3d 944, 945 (8th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., Milton v. Heller, ___ U.S. \n___, 116 S.Ct. 87, 133 L.Ed.2d 44 (1995); Casey v. City of Cabool, 12 F.3d 799, 804 (8th \nCir. 1993), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 325, 130 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994). \nTherefore, Plaintiffs' $2.00 award in nominal damages for access-to-the-courts violations \nmakes Plaintiffs prevailing parties for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nB. Nominal Damage Award as Technical or De Minimis \nDespite the fact a plaintiff may be a prevailing party, when a plaintiff's success is \"purely \ntechnical or de minimis, no fees can be awarded.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. at 116, 113 \nS.Ct. at 576 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The relevant indicia of success are: (1) the extent of \nrelief achieved as measured by the difference between the amount recovered and the \ndamages sought; (2) the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed; and \n(3) the public purpose or goal the litigation might have served. Id. at 120-23, 113 S.Ct. at \n578-79 (O'Connor, J., concurring). See also Jones v. Lockhart, 29 F.3d 422, 423-24 (8th \n\nCir.1994) (applying O'Connor factors in Farrar to prisoner civil rights case where Plaintiff \nalleged three Eighth Amendment claims and recovered $2.00 on one of the claims, with \ndefendants prevailing on all other claims; court found Plaintiff's victory \"though minimally \ncompensated, was not pyrrhic or technical.\"). Applying these factors to the present case, I \nconclude that Plaintiffs' success is not technical or de minimis. \n1. Difference Between Recovery and Relief Sought \nFirst, I cannot say that the difference between the amount recovered, $2.00, and damages \nsought was dramatic because Plaintiffs simply requested an award of \"compensatory and \npunitive damages.\" (Filing 333, at 19 (Pls.' Third Am. Compl.).) Compare Farrar, 506 U.S. at \n121, 113 S.Ct. at 578 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (17 million dollars sought; one dollar \nrecovered). \n2. Significance of Legal Issue \nSecond, like the court in Jones v. Lockhart, 29 F.3d at 424, I find that vindication of the \n\"fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts,\" Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, \n828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 1335*1335 (1977), is \"a significant legal issue in \ncontrast to the injury to a business interest alleged in Farrar.\"[3] Access to the courts has \nbeen described as \"perhaps the most cherished of all constitutional guarantees\" because \nwithout such access \"none of the other rights which the Constitution guarantees would be \nsecure.\" Vaughn v. Trotter, 516 F.Supp. 886, 900 (M.D.Tenn.1980). Thus, Plaintiffs' victory \non their access-to-the-courts claim involved enforcement of the one fundamental \nconstitutional right which is pivotal to the enforcement of all other rights, and is therefore a \nvictory on a significant legal issue. \n3. Public Purpose or Goal Served by Litigation \nFinally, this particular litigation served a public goal or purpose, as does civil rights litigation \nin general. \nA plaintiff bringing a civil rights action \"does so not for himself alone but also as a `private \nattorney general,' vindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\" \nJones v. Lockhart, 29 F.3d 422, 424 (8th Cir.1994) (quoting Casey v. City of Cabool, 12 \nF.3d 799, 805 (8th Cir.1993), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 325, 130 L.Ed.2d 285 \n(1994) (quoting Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966-\n67, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968))). \nThe content of Plaintiffs' access-to-the-courts claim suggests that Plaintiffs' main goal with \nrespect to this claim was to remedy the inadequate law library at NCW, correct the legal-\naide situation, and change Defendants' unconstitutional policies. During the course of this \nlitigation, that goal has been achieved. (Br. Supp. Pls.' Appl. Attorney Fees & Expenses, \nApp. A (timeline indicating corrective measures taken at NCW, as established by evidence, \nduring course of this litigation).) \"The chronological sequence of events is an important \n\nfactor in determining whether or not it can be inferred that the defendants guided their \nactions in response to plaintiffs' lawsuit.\" United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, 622 \nF.2d 342, 347 (8th Cir.1980) (noting that even though defendants made some efforts in \naddressing the alleged discrimination prior to the filing of the plaintiffs' lawsuit, certain \nevents took place after filing suit and efforts to address the discrimination increased sharply \nafter suit was filed). \nThe chronological events in this case lead to an inference, id., that Defendants guided their \nactions with respect to the NCW library in response to Plaintiffs' lawsuit. As the \"law library\" \ntimeline and overlay of Appendix A indicates, a number of pivotal changes regarding \nPlaintiffs' access-to-the-courts claim coincide with identifiable events in this litigation. For \ninstance, shortly after counsel was appointed (October 1988), the inmate legal aide position \nwas filled (January 1989) and the law library was moved and inventoried. One month before \nthe first scheduled trial date (December 1989), NCW segregation and orientation inmates \nwere given direct physical access to the law library, and the law library materials were \nexpanded to include the Shepard's citator. One month before the third scheduled trial date \n(November 1990), the NCW law library materials were expanded yet again to include the \nFederal Shepard's citator. (Br. Supp. Pls.' Appl. Attorney Fees & Expenses, App. A (\"Law \nLibrary\" timeline with \"Case Progression\" overlay and references to exhibits in evidence \nindicating corrective measures taken at NCW, as established by evidence, during course of \nthis litigation).) \nBased on this chronology, it is clear that this litigation served a public goal or purpose by \nensuring that the NCW law library complies with Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 \nS.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), and that NCW policies provide for adequate \naccess to the courts. \n4. Conclusion Regarding Victory as Technical \nTherefore, under the O'Connor test set forth in Farrar and adopted by the \nEighth 1336*1336 Circuit Court of Appeals, Jones v. Lockhart, 29 F.3d 422 (8th \nCir.1994), Plaintiffs' victory in this case was neither technical nor de minimis, entitling \nPlaintiffs to an award of attorney fees and expenses under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nC. The Lodestar \nIn what has come to be known as the \"lodestar,\" a reasonable attorney fee in § 1988 cases \nis the number of hours reasonably expended on the lawsuit, multiplied by a reasonable \nhourly rate. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 \n(1983). Courts are to look to the marketplace as a guide in determining what is a \n\"reasonable\" attorney fee. Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2470, \n105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989); Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547 n. \n11, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (reasonableness of requested rates is to be determined with \nreference to rates prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of \ncomparable skill, experience, and reputation). \n\nSubsumed within the lodestar calculation are the \"Johnson factors,\" derived from Johnson \nv. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974). Hensley v. \nEckerhart, 461 U.S. at 429-30 & 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. at 1937-38 & 1940 n. 9 (referring \nto Johnson factors, and noting that \"many of these factors usually are subsumed within the \ninitial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate\").[4] \nI now turn to calculation of the lodestar, specifically taking into account \nthe Johnson factors.[5] \n1. Calculation of Reasonable Hourly Rate \na. Customary Fees \nPlaintiffs' counsel's hourly billing rate for this litigation and other civil matters of similar size \nand complexity are as follows: \n       Robert T. Grimit      $150.00 \n       Gail S. Perry         $120.00 \n       David A. Dudley       $100.00 \n       Stephanie F. Stacy    $ 90.00 \n(Grimit Aff. ¶¶ 4, 7; Perry Aff. ¶¶ 5, 9.) Further, because it is the practice in the relevant \nmarket to bill clients for the services of paralegals and law clerks, counsel have set forth the \nfollowing billing rates for those individuals in this and similar litigation: \n       Paralegals            $ 50.00 \n       Law Clerks            $ 35.00 \nSee Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 286-88, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2470-72, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 \n(1989) (if practice in relevant market is to bill work of paralegals separately, that is what § \n1988 requires). (Perry Aff. ¶¶ 5, 11; Covalt Aff. ¶ 7.) \nAs evidenced by the affidavits submitted in this matter, these rates are well within the range \nof reasonableness for complex civil rights litigation in the Lincoln, Nebraska, area for \nattorneys with similar skill, experience, and ability. (Buntain Aff. ¶ 6; Covalt Aff. ¶ 6.) \nb. Skill, Experience, Reputation, and Ability of \nCounsel \nThe skill, experience, reputation, and ability of counsel in this case are outstanding. Robert \nT. Grimit has practiced law since 1964 and is a partner at the law firm of Baylor, Evnen, \nCurtiss, Grimit & Witt in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mr. Grimit has been 1337*1337 involved in \nvarious types of complex litigation, including civil rights litigation, and has practiced \nextensively in state and federal courts. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 2.) Mr. Grimit was actively involved in \ncivil rights litigation for a number of years, and is now serving in an advisory and \nconsultative capacity in such cases. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 2.) Among numerous other professional \n\naffiliations and special distinctions, Mr. Grimit has held several executive positions in the \nNebraska State Bar Association, including president, and is also a Fellow of the American \nBar Foundation. (Grimit Aff., Ex. A.) \nGail S. Perry, also a partner in the Baylor law firm, is rated \"AV\" by Martindale-Hubbell and \nis an active participant in the Nebraska State Bar Association, including election to a second \nterm in the NSBA House of Delegates commencing in 1995. Ms. Perry also serves on the \nFederal Practice Committee for the District of Nebraska. (Perry Aff. ¶ 2.) Ms. Perry's special \ndistinctions include membership in Phi Beta Kappa; authoring several articles dealing with \nlaw and psychology; serving as chair of the Allen Moot Court Board at the University of \nNebraska College of Law; and serving as judicial law clerk for United States Magistrate \nDavid L. Piester, where Ms. Perry gained substantial experience with inmate civil rights \nlitigation. (Perry Aff., Ex. A & ¶ 3.) Ms. Perry has performed civil rights defense work \nthroughout her legal career, and since becoming partner of her law firm in 1992, \napproximately one-third of Ms. Perry's work has consisted of such work (excluding time \nspent in the Klinger matter). (Perry Aff. ¶ 3.) \nDavid A. Dudley is a partner of the Baylor law firm, and is rated \"BV\" by Martindale-Hubbell. \n(Dudley Aff. ¶¶ 1-2.) Mr. Dudley graduated from the University of Nebraska College of Law \nwith distinction, and while in law school was a member of the Allen Moot Court Board; Order \nof the Barristers, a national oral advocacy honorary; and the National Moot Court Team. \n(Dudley Aff., Ex. A.) \nStephanie F. Stacy is now an associate with the Baylor law firm after having served as a \nlaw clerk for the firm while in law school at the University of Nebraska College of Law. \n(Stacy Aff. ¶ 1.) Ms. Stacy graduated from the College of Law with distinction and as a \nmember of the Order of the Coif. While in law school, Ms. Stacy was a member of the \nNebraska Law Review, the Allen Moot Court Board, and the National Moot Court Team; \nreceived American Jurisprudence Awards in four courses, among them Criminal Trial and \nPostconviction Procedure; and wrote a law review comment which was selected for \npublication. (Stacy Aff. ¶ 2.) Like Ms. Perry, Ms. Stacy served as a law clerk for United \nStates Magistrate David L. Piester for two years, during which she had intensive contact \nand involvement with inmate civil rights suits in federal court. (Stacy Aff. ¶ 3.) \nCounsel's reputation in the legal community for quality of work is excellent. (Buntain Aff. ¶ 4 \n(\"Robert T. Grimit and Gail S. Perry ... [are] very capable, skilled and accomplished trial \nattorneys\"); Covalt Aff. ¶ 4 (\"Robert T. Grimit, Gail S. Perry and David A. Dudley ... [are] \nexcellent trial attorneys\").) \nCounsel's performance in this particular case has been as superb as each attorney's \ncredentials. As I have previously noted, \"[a]ppointed counsels' service was of the very \nhighest caliber.\" Klinger v. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Services, 824 F.Supp. at 1382 n. \n4. \nc. Awards in Similar Cases \nWhile the requested hourly rates for David A. Dudley ($100) and Stephanie F. Stacy ($90) \nare well within the range customarily awarded by this court in civil rights litigation, and while \n\nthe requested hourly rates for paralegals ($50) and law clerks ($35) are actually lower than \nthat allowed for similar work in other civil rights cases, Tabech v. Gunter, 869 F.Supp. 1446, \n1456 & 1461 (D.Neb.1994) (attorney rate of $85-$105 per hour in civil rights cases of the \ntype involved in that case was reasonable; $55 allowed for paralegal and $45 for law clerk), \nthe hourly rates claimed for attorneys Robert Grimit ($150) and Gail Perry ($120) are \noutside this range. \nWhile the $85.00-$105.00 range may be reasonable for most civil rights cases, I believe the \nextraordinary nature of this case, as 1338*1338 well as the preeminence of the attorneys \ninvolved in this litigation, justify the higher rates of Mr. Grimit and Ms. Perry. This case was \nan extremely broad, unusually complex, institution-wide challenge to the constitutionality of \nNCW programs and services— a case which was made even more extraordinary by the \nbehavior of former defense counsel. \nUnfortunately, prior to the involvement in the case of Elaine Chapman and Laurie Smith \nCamp, counsel for the defense, this matter was often one of the most unpleasant cases in \nwhich I have ever been involved. In my professional opinion, during the time I have been \nengaged in the practice of law in Lincoln, Nebraska, our firm and its attorneys have never \nbeen treated worse by opposing counsel. \n(Grimit Aff. ¶ 10; see also Perry Aff. ¶ 23 (describing former defense counsel's conduct as \n\"zealous representation without a purpose\" which was \"a major distraction in this case and \npersonally stressful\").) \nAdding to the extraordinary nature of the case was the four-week trial, including some \nweekends; the management of voluminous exhibits; and the orchestration of numerous \ninmate and corrections witnesses who required extreme flexibility in a not-so-flexible court \nschedule. (Perry Aff. ¶ 13 & Ex. A (\"I can only describe it as ferocious, beyond any litigation \nI have observed, heard of, or been involved in [in] my [12-year legal] career\").) \nd. Nature and Length of Relationship with Clients \nCounsel in Klinger were appointed in 1988 and continue in 1995 to serve in that capacity, a \ntime period which equals what this court termed an \"extraordinary\" length of representation \nin Tabech v. Gunter, 869 F.Supp. 1446, 1458 (D.Neb.1994) (counsel appointed in 1987 to \nserve a large and diverse group of prison inmates for seven years; nature and length of \nrepresentation should be considered extraordinary in terms of responsibility to a large \nnumber of plaintiffs and the sheer duration of the case). \ne. Undesirability of Case \nPlaintiffs' counsel's appointment to this case is not one envied by other private attorneys \n(Powers Aff. ¶ 7; commenting on time required in such cases and fact that compensation \ngiven does not reflect inherent risks and loss of business) because prisoners can make \nunsympathetic plaintiffs and difficult clients, and the time required to ferret out potential \nclaims, conduct discovery, and present such cases in trial is extraordinary (Covalt Aff. ¶ 2). \nMany of counsel's regular clients reacted adversely to the Baylor firm's vigorous \n\nrepresentation of the Plaintiff inmates in this case, and the enormity of this case had a \nsignificant adverse impact on counsel's firm in terms of total time expended and the cash \nflow required to pursue the case. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 8.) Also added to the undesirability of the \ncase were counsel's time-consuming and unpleasant disputes with former defense counsel, \nas discussed above. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 10; Perry Aff. ¶ 23.) \nf. Loss of Other Employment \nThe affidavits submitted by Plaintiffs' counsel demonstrate that the time commitment \ninvolved in representing Plaintiffs in this complex litigation served to seriously reduce the \namount of time Plaintiffs' attorneys were able to spend on other billable accounts, \nparticularly during peak periods in the litigation. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 8; Perry Aff. ¶¶ 14-15; \nBlackwell Aff., Ex. N.) The amount of work performed by Plaintiffs' attorneys and their staff \non this case often required redistribution of workloads within the firm, causing an adverse \neffect on overall firm economics and on employee morale. (Perry Aff. ¶¶ 12, 14-16; Grimit \nAff. ¶ 8-9.) \ng. Time Limitations Imposed by Client or \nCircumstances \n\"Priority work that delays the lawyer's other legal work is entitled to some \npremium.\" Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d at 718. As discussed \nabove, counsel's other legal work was seriously delayed or redistributed in order to give \npriority to this case, particularly during peak litigation periods. (Grimit Aff. ¶ 8; Perry Aff. ¶¶ \n14-15; Blackwell Aff., Ex. N.) Further, the liability trial was uniquely intensive in terms of \nlength of trial days, number and management of exhibits, orchestration of inmate and \ncorrections witnesses, and the selective presentation of evidence required \nto 1339*1339 compress the trial into the four-week period allotted. (Perry Aff. ¶ 13.) \nh. Conclusion Regarding Rates \nConsidering the above factors, I conclude that the rates requested by Plaintiffs' counsel for \nall attorneys, paralegals, and law clerks are reasonable and should be adopted and used to \ncalculate the lodestar. \n2. Calculation of Hours Reasonably Expended \nThe manner in which Plaintiffs' counsel have calculated hours reasonably expended on this \nlitigation has been described in detail in section (B)(1), above. \na. Time and Labor Required \nAfter reducing the hours actually expended on this litigation as described in section (B)(1), \nabove, the total number of hours reasonably expended in representing Plaintiffs in this case \nis as follows for each primary timekeeper: \n\n    Robert T. Grimit           471.3 hours \n    Gail S. Perry            1,684.8 hours \n    David A. Dudley            955.7 hours \n    Stephanie F. Stacy         187.8 hours as attorney \n                                77.9 hours as law clerk \n    Susan L. Blackwell       1,543.9 hours \n    Kirsten L. Gregory         202.2 hours \n                             _____________ \n                             5,123.6 hours \n(Blackwell Aff., Exs. L & M.) Plaintiffs wish to add to these figures 216 hours for telephone \ncalls, 177.4 hours for correspondence, and 214.5 hours for preparation of the fee \napplication. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16, 17 & Exs. M, S.) An average hourly billing rate for all \nprimary timekeepers of $105.00 per hour was multiplied by telephone and correspondence \nhours, while each timekeeper's individual hourly rate was multiplied by the hours outlined in \nthe table above and by the fee-application hours. (Blackwell Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16 & Exs. L, S.) \nThus, the total number of hours claimed to have been reasonably expended on this case is \n5,731.5 and may be summarized as follows: \nRobert T. Grimit                 Total Hours \n   471.3 hrs.                       471.3 \nGail S. Perry \n  1,684.8 hrs. + 42.8 hrs. (fee \n  app.) =                         1,727.6 \nDavid A. Dudley                  Total Hours \n   955.7 hrs.                       955.7 \nStephanie F. Stacy \n  187.8 hrs. (atty.) + 71.1 hrs. \n  (fee app.) =                      258.9 \n  77.9 hrs. (law clk.)               77.9 \nSusan L. Blackwell \n  1,543.9 hrs. + 72.0 hrs. (fee \n  app.) =                         1,615.9 \nKirsten L. Gregory \n  202.2 hrs. + 28.6 hrs. (fee \n  app.) =                           230.8 \n                                  _______ \n                                  5,338.1 \nTelephone Calls                     216.0 \nCorrespondence                      177.4 \n                                  _______ \n                                  5,731.5 \nb. Novelty and Difficulty of Issues \nAlthough Plaintiffs' attorneys had familiarity with prisoner civil rights cases when they were \nappointed to represent Plaintiffs, this case, in addition to containing a myriad of \nconstitutional issues, involved many issues of first impression in this district. As such, the \n\ninvestigation, preparation, presentation, and briefing of this case required more time and \neffort on counsel's part than would be involved in a typical civil rights case. Johnson v. \nGeorgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d at 718 (cases of first impression require more \ntime and effort on attorneys' part). \nc. Conclusion Regarding Hours Reasonably Expended \nAgain considering the above factors, I conclude that the hours requested by Plaintiffs' \ncounsel for all attorneys, paralegals, and law clerks are reasonable and should be adopted \nand used to calculate the lodestar. \n3. Calculation of the Lodestar \nThe lodestar requested by Plaintiffs' counsel may be summarized as follows: \nRobert T. Grimit                              Total Fee \n  471.3 hrs. × $150 (rate) =                  $70,695.00 \nGail S. Perry \n  1,727.6 hrs. × $120 (rate) =               $207,312.00 \nDavid A. Dudley \n  955.7 hrs. × $100 (rate) =                  $95,570.00 \nStephanie F. Stacy \n  258.9 hrs. (atty.) × $90 (rate) =           $23,301.00 \n  77.9 hrs. (law clk.) × $35 (rate) =          $2,726.50 \nSusan L. Blackwell \n  1,615.9 hrs. × $50 (rate) =                 $80,795.00 \n1340*1340 \nKirsten L.

Reduction for Partial or Incomplete Success \nIn Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 \n(1983), the Supreme Court recognized that the product of hours reasonably expended on \nthe litigation times a reasonably hourly rate may be excessive if the plaintiff has achieved \nonly partial or limited success. \"There is no precise rule or formula for making these \ndeterminations. The district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be \neliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success. The court \nnecessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment.\" Id. at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. at \n1941. \na. Partial Success \n\"[W]here the plaintiff advances discrete, essentially unrelated claims, and prevails on some \nbut not others, it should not be compensated for work on the unsuccessful claims.\" Alan \nHirsch & Diane Sheehey, Awarding Attorneys' Fees and Managing Fee Litigation at 27-28 \n(Federal Judicial Center 1994) (footnotes omitted) (citing Hensley). \"However, in the \nmajority of cases, courts have rejected the contention that the lodestar should be adjusted \ndownward for unsuccessful claims, usually finding that the successful and unsuccessful \nclaims were legally or factually intertwined or that counsel devoted most of its time to the \nlitigation as a whole.\" Id. See Casey v. City of Cabool, 12 F.3d 799, 806 (8th Cir.1993), cert. \ndenied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 325, 130 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994) (when party prevails, fee \naward should not be reduced merely because party did not prevail on every theory raised in \n\nthe lawsuit; the \"dispositive consideration\" is \"whether the issues upon which plaintiff's \ncounsel spent time are interrelated to the central issues of the case\"). \nMany civil rights cases will present only a single claim. In other cases the plaintiff's claims \nfor relief will involve a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories. Much \nof counsel's time will be 1341*1341 devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it \ndifficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit cannot be \nviewed as a series of discrete claims. Instead the district court should focus on the \nsignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably \nexpended on the litigation. \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). \nThis case involved a central issue derived from a common core of facts and four related \nlegal theories — that is, the systematic constitutional inadequacy of most programs and \nservices offered to NCW inmates. The Klinger court essentially examined seven NCW \nprogram or service areas — ranging from employment and economic programs to the \nconstitutional adequacy of the law library and medical services — in deciding what was \nbasically one claim: whether such programs and services violated constitutional \nnorms. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1455-63 & 1464-66 (claims outlined). \nTherefore, Plaintiff's successful access-to-the-courts claim was factually and legally \nintertwined with Plaintiffs' other constitutional challenges to NCW programs and \nservices. See Hensley, 461 U.S. 424, 427 & 438, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1936 & 1942 (court found \nconstitutional violations in five of six general areas at state hospital unit for the involuntarily \nconfined — physical environment, individual treatment plans, least restrictive environment, \nprivileges, and seclusion and restraint; court found \"interrelated nature of the facts and legal \ntheories\"). Indeed, this is clearly not a case where \"counsel's work on one claim [was] \nunrelated to [her] work on another claim.\" Id. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1942. (Perry Aff. ¶ 27.) \nTherefore, I find that there is no justifiable basis for reducing the lodestar for partial success \nbecause the claims in this case were related, both legally and factually. \nb. Incomplete Success \n\"[E]ven if claims are closely related, or there is just one claim, a downward adjustment to \nthe lodestar may be appropriate if the plaintiff achieved only limited success. In such a \ncase, the gauge of success is the result of the lawsuit in terms of relief. ...\" Alan Hirsch & \nDiane Sheehey, Awarding Attorneys' Fees and Managing Fee Litigation at 29 (Federal \nJudicial Center 1994). \"The result is what matters.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at \n1940. \nI conclude that the lodestar must be dramatically reduced for incomplete success because \nPlaintiffs have not prevailed in six out of the seven program areas challenged, Klinger \nIV, 902 F.Supp. at 1042 & 1044 (damages trial only on finding that two defendants violated \nPlaintiffs' constitutional right to access to the courts; Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 97 \nS.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), violation proven as to general population and \n\nsegregation/orientation inmates), and because Plaintiffs were only about 50 percent \nsuccessful on their access-to-the-courts claim, Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1459 & 1464 \n(Plaintiffs proved Bounds violation, but did not prove equal protection violation); Klinger \nII, 31 F.3d 727 (8th Cir.1994) (Plaintiffs' equal protection claim dismissed). \nThus, the lodestar must be reduced as follows: \nLodestar:                          $529,784.50 \nExpenses:                          $ 50,821.71 \nReduction for Not Prevailing \non Six of Seven \nClaims:                            6/7 or 86% \nFurther Reduction for Prevailing \non Half of One \nSuccessful Claim:                  7% \nFinal Attorney Fees:    $37,084.92 \nFinal Expenses:                    $ 3,557.52[7] \nc. Conclusion Regarding Award \nI have therefore determined to award counsel for Plaintiffs the sum of $37,084.92 in \nattorney fees (seven percent of the lodestar of $529,784.50) and $3,557.52 in expenses \n(seven percent of the $50,821.71 in expenses 1342*1342 requested). This attorney fee \naward provides weighted effective hourly rates of approximately $6.47 for all timekeepers; \n$8.14 for lawyers; $2.45 for law clerks; $3.50 for paralegals; and $7.35 for telephone and \ncorrespondence tasks. \nI am as personally troubled by this award as anything I have ever done as a judge. In this \nage when lawyers are attacked for various and sundry reasons, some good, but most bad, \nthe conduct of appointed counsel in this case stands as a shining tribute to the legal \nprofession. Unfortunately, the law, at least as I read it, does not permit me to recognize in \nmonetary terms anything close to the value of the work these fine lawyers expended in this \ncase. I am truly sorry. \nE. Upward Adjustment \nBecause the court has used the reasonable hourly rates requested by Plaintiffs' counsel for \neach class of timekeepers, Plaintiff does not request an enhancement to produce a \nreasonable attorney fee. (Br. Supp. Pls.' Appl. Attorney Fees & Expenses at 36-37.) \nIT IS ORDERED: \n(1) Plaintiffs' motion (filing 723) requesting an award of attorney fees and expenses is \ngranted in part and denied in part, and the plaintiffs are awarded $37,084.92 in fees and \n$3,557.52 in expenses, for a total attorney fee award of $40,642.44; and \n\n(2) Final judgment shall be entered by separate document contemporaneously with the filing \nof this memorandum and order. \nJUDGMENT \nJudgment is entered in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendants Victor Lofgreen \nand Larry Tewes for $2.00 in nominal damages and attorney fees (and costs) of $40,642.44 \nregarding the access-to-the-courts claim, and as to all other claims Judgment is entered in \nfavor of the Defendants and against Plaintiffs, providing that Plaintiffs shall take nothing and \nthis case as to those claims is dismissed. \n[1] All affidavits and exhibits from these individuals are part of Filing 724, but this filing number will not be repeated for \nease of citation. \n[2] Primary timekeepers were senior partner Robert T. Grimit; partner Gail S. Perry; partner David A. Dudley; \nassociate Stephanie F. Stacy, who worked initially on the case as a law clerk; paralegal Susan L. Blackwell; and law \nclerk Kirsten Gregory. (Perry Aff. ¶ 6.) \n[3] Farrar involved coadministrators of decedent Farrar's estate who sought from Texas officials $17 million in \ncompensatory damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985 for the alleged illegal closure of a school that Farrar \nand his son operated. Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. at 105-06, 113 S.Ct. at 570. \n[4] \"Hensley makes clear that [the Johnson factors] matter only as they bear on the market rate or hours reasonably \nexpended, or, in rare cases, if they are a basis for adjusting the lodestar.\" Alan Hirsch & Diane Sheehey, Awarding \nAttorneys' Fees and Managing Fee Litigation at 19 n. 84 (Federal Judicial Center 1994). In reaching my decision, I \nhave considered each and every Johnson factor. These factors are: (1) time and labor required; (2) novelty and \ndifficulty of issues; (3) skill required; (4) loss of other employment; (5) customary fee; (6) whether fee is fixed or \ncontingent; (7) time limitations imposed by client or circumstances; (8) amount involved and results obtained; (9) \ncounsel's experience, reputation, and ability; (10) undesirability of case; (11) nature and length of relationship with \nclients; and (12) awards in similar cases. Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d at 717-19. \n[5] The sixth Johnson factor, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, will not be considered since there was no fee \nagreement between Plaintiffs and counsel because counsel was appointed by the court. (Br. Supp. Pls.' Appl. for \nAttorney Fees & Expenses at 16.) \n[6] The \"weighted effective rate\" for lawyers was calculated by multiplying the approved hours for each lawyer times \nthe market or approved rate for that lawyer. The totals for each lawyer were then added together, and that total was \nthen divided by the total number of hours attributed to lawyers as a class. The same procedure was followed for each \nclass of timekeeper. \n[7] A \"reasonable attorney's fee\" under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 \"must also take account of other expenses and \nprofit.\" Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2470, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989). Therefore, the \nexpenses requested must also be reduced by seven percent as part of the attorney's fee award. \n ",

The \nmotion seeks expansion of the non-final liability findings regarding Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (Title IX), set forth in my opinion in Klinger \nv. Nebraska Dep't of Correctional Services, 824 F.Supp. 1374, 1431-34 (D.Neb.1993) \n(Klinger I), rev'd on equal protection grounds, 31 F.3d 727 (8th Cir.1994) (Klinger II), cert. \ndenied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1177, 130 L.Ed.2d 1130 (1995). \nI shall deny the plaintiffs' motion. However, on my own initiative, pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 54(b), I will now revise Klinger I regarding the previous non-final Title IX \nliability determination. I do so because I believe that a good-faith application of Klinger \nII destroys the basis for my previous liability finding regarding Title IX even though Klinger \nII explicitly dealt with only a related equal protection question. Stated simply, I reverse \nmyself on the Title IX issue based upon the Court of Appeals' reasoning in Klinger II.[1] \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis case deals with women in prison at the Nebraska Center for Women (NCW), the only \nprison for women in Nebraska.[2] The women at NCW filed suit, claiming in essence that \nthey were not treated equitably in comparison with their male counterparts at the Nebraska \nState Penitentiary (NSP) in terms of programs and services. \nIn order to understand the issues that now confront me, it is necessary to have a clear \nunderstanding of both Klinger I and Klinger II. \n\nA. KLINGER I \nAs I indicated in Klinger I, that opinion dealt with four issues: \n(1) Were the female inmates at NCW discriminated against because of their sex in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by a quantitative or qualitative \nlack of \"parity\" in programs 1283*1283 and services as compared to the male inmates at \nNSP; \n(2) Were the female inmates at NCW discriminated against because of their sex in violation \nof Title IX ... by a quantitative or qualitative lack of \"parity\" in educational programs receiving \nfederal financial assistance as compared to the male inmates at NSP; \n(3) Were the female inmates at NCW denied their right of access to the courts under the \nFourteenth Amendment because of the alleged inadequacy of the law library and the \nalleged lack of trained and independent inmate legal aides at NCW; \n(4) Were the female inmates at NCW denied their right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment because of the alleged deliberate indifference to \ntheir serious medical and dental needs. \nKlinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1384-85. \nAfter a long bench trial on liability only, I issued a detailed set of findings of fact and \nconclusions of law with regard to the issue of liability. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1380-1469. I \ndid not, however, enter a judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Id. at \n1469. \nFirst, with regard to the equal protection claim, I initially found that \"the fact remains that \nfemale prisoners, as a result of their gender alone, can receive only the programs available \nat NCW.\" Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1388. I then determined that \"heightened scrutiny,\" \nrather than \"rational basis\" scrutiny, should be applied to this policy and the programs which \nflowed (or did not flow) from this policy.[3] Id. I next determined that it was proper to compare \nthe female inmates at NCW with the male inmates at NSP for purposes of determining \nwhether the female inmates were subjected to an equal protection violation because the two \ngroups were \"similarly situated.\" Id. at 1388-1390. Finally, I compared, on a program-by-\nprogram basis, the various program offerings (like educational programs) and service \nofferings (like medical services) at NCW and NSP and concluded that in many (but not all) \ncategories an equal protection violation had been proven when the programs and services \nwere examined by reference to the \"heightened scrutiny\" standard. Id. at 1390-1431. \nSecondly, with regard to the Title IX claim that the NCW women had been subjected to \ndiscrimination in educational programs receiving federal financial assistance, I initially \ndetermined that Title IX applied to prisons. Id. at 1431. I then determined that DCS received \nfederal financial assistance in the form of \"Perkins Act\" funds for operation of its \nprerelease[4] educational program at all the adult institutions under the control of DCS. I then \nfound that a \"violation of Title IX has been established by virtue of my earlier prerelease \nequal protection finding.\" Id. at 1432 (emphasis added). I also noted that Plaintiffs had \nargued that other federal funds were received in relation to other programs for which an \nequal protection violation had been proven, but I declined, \"at this point,\" to pass on these \nother arguments because the briefing was too sketchy. Id. at 1432 n. 103. \n\nSpecifically, I found that both NSP and NCW offered prerelease educational programs of \ncomparable quality, but Title IX, like the Equal Protection Clause, was violated because \nNCW did not offer regularly scheduled prerelease programs while NSP did. Id. at 1411-14 & \n1432. Also, I found that intentional Title IX discrimination had been proven. Id. at 1433-34. \nFor the finding of a Title IX violation, as well as the intentional Title IX violation, I relied, as \ndid the plaintiffs, upon the comparison of NCW to NSP that had been used for the \nequal 1284*1284 protection analysis. Id. at 1433-34.[5] \nThirdly, in addition to an equal protection violation regarding certain law library issues, id. at \n1414-17, I also found that the NCW inmates had been denied their Fourteenth Amendment \nright of access to the courts in two particulars. Id. at 1434-38. \nFourth, although I found an equal protection violation regarding certain medical and dental \npolicies, id. at 1417-23, I found these inadequacies did not amount to an Eighth Amendment \nviolation. Id. at 1438-40. \nFifth, in terms of ultimate liability, I found that: the directors of DCS had liability for the equal \nprotection and Title IX[6] violations, id. at 1441-44; the NCW staff had no liability for the \nequal protection and Title IX violations, id. at 1448-49; the directors of DCS did not have \nliability for the access-to-courts violations, id. at 1449-51; and two former superintendents of \nNCW had liability for the access-to-the-courts violation, id. at 1451-52. \nB. KLINGER II \nI certified three questions to the Court of Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Klinger \nII, 31 F.3d at 730. Those questions, summarized, were: \n(1) for equal protection purposes, were the inmates at NCW similarly situated to the inmates \nat NSP? \n(2) for equal protection purposes, was \"heightened scrutiny\" rather than \"rational basis \nscrutiny\" properly applied? \n(3) for equal protection purposes, did the State of Nebraska have an obligation to provide \nNCW inmates programs and services which are \"substantially equivalent\" to the male \ninmates at NSP? \nId. \nWith one judge dissenting, the Court of Appeals answered that the \"NSP inmates are not \nsimilarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services.\" Id. Accordingly, the court \nreversed \"the district court's order finding the defendants liable and dismiss[ed] the plaintiffs' \nequal protection claim.\" Id. The court did not squarely address the other certified questions. \nThe Court of Appeals was particularly persuaded that the inmates at NSP were not similarly \nsituated to the inmates at NCW because: (1) \"NCW houses the fewest inmates\"; (2) NSP \n\"houses about six times as many inmates as NCW\"; (3) \"the average length of inmate stay \n\nat NSP is two to three times as long as it is at NCW\"; (4) NSP has a higher security level \nthan NCW; and (5) \"female inmates as a class have special characteristics distinguishing \nthem from male inmates.\" Id. at 731-32. \nThe consequence of these differences to the Court of Appeals was two-fold. First, in terms \nof number of programs, \"whether NCW lacks one program that NSP has proves almost \nnothing.\" Id. at 732. Second, in terms of quality of programs, \"there will always be stark \ndifferences in programming,\" and the Constitution does not require \"all prisons to have \nsimilar program priorities and to allocate resources similarly.\" Id. \nIn summary, the Court of Appeals held that: \nDifferences between challenged programs at the two prisons are virtually irrelevant because \nso many variables affect the mix of programming that an institution has.... In short, \ncomparing programs at NSP to those at NCW is like the proverbial comparison of apples to \noranges. \nId. at 733. \nThe Klinger II majority then issued a rejoinder, id. at 733-734, to the dissent's point that \ninferiority of programs and services at NCW flowed from the facially non-neutral policy of \nsending women to one prison and men to a variety of prisons, and thus 1285*1285 it was \nproper to employ the level of scrutiny employed by the district court (heightened \nscrutiny). Id. at 737-739. The majority rejoined that intentional discrimination is what the \nConstitution seeks to prohibit, and that because there was a facially neutral policy regarding \nprograms, although there was a facially non-neutral policy of assigning women to the one \nprison for women[7], the district court and the dissent would improperly relieve the plaintiffs \nof proving intentional discrimination. Id. at 733-34. \nII. DISCUSSION \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) explicitly provides that in the absence of a judgment a \n\"decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and \nliabilities of fewer than all the parties ... is subject to revision at any time before the entry of \njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\" Because \nI did not enter a judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) and since the trial was bifurcated between \nliability and remedy, I therefore have the power to revise Klinger I pursuant to Rule 54(b). \nPlaintiffs assert that I should revise Klinger I to expand my opinion on Title IX so as to treat \nvirtually all of the equal protection violations as Title IX violations. After careful thought, I do \nnot believe I should do so. Indeed, I now believe that I must reverse, rather than amplify, my \nprevious decision regarding Title IX. I am so persuaded because Klinger II destroys the \nprobative force of the evidence — comparative inequality between NSP and NCW — that I \nrelied upon to find not only Equal Protection Clause violations, but also the Title IX violation. \nA. \n\nTitle IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal assistance: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.... \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). \nWhen the alleged lack of, or inferiority in, prison educational programs has been challenged \nunder Title IX, the few courts that have found violations of Title IX have been presented, as \na predicate to liability, with a comparison of either (a) all prisons in the system, see, \ne.g., Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1222 (9th Cir.1994) (comparing all adult Oregon \nprisons); Canterino v. Wilson, 546 F.Supp. 174, 191-92 \n(W.D.Ky.1982) (comparing 1286*1286 all adult Kentucky prisons), vacated on other \ngrounds, 869 F.2d 948 (6th Cir.1989), or (b) a comparison between similarly \nsituated prisons. See Women Prisoners of Dist. of Columbia Dep't of Corrections v. District \nof Columbia, 877 F.Supp. 634, 675-78 (D.D.C.1994) (comparing \"similarly situated\" women \nat Lorton Minimum Security Annex with \"similarly situated\" males at the Minimum Facility, \nand \"similarly situated\" women at the Correctional Treatment Facility with \"similarly situated \nmales\" at the Occoquan, Central, and Medium facilities; court found groups \"similarly \nsituated\" on basis of similar custody levels, sentence structures, and purposes of \nincarceration). \nEven when the courts have infrequently found a Title IX violation given comparisons \nbetween all prisons or similarly situated prisons, the courts have also been quick to caution \nthat: \"Prisons are different from other institutions to which Title IX applies. Security is an \nimportant concern. And sex segregation is the accepted norm.\" Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1228. \nIndeed, under the expansive interpretation of Title IX set forth in Jeldness where all Oregon \nprisons were examined, Title IX was not interpreted to \"require gender-integrated classes in \nprisons,\" id. at 1228, or to require \"[s]trict one-for-one identity of classes,\" id. at 1229, or to \nrequire \"as many classes in a small women's prison as in the larger men's prisons.\" Id. In \nfact, the Jeldness court made clear that under Title IX the \"programs need not be identical \nin number or content....\" Id. \nThus, one cannot draw the conclusion that differences in treatment occur \"on the basis of \nsex\" as proscribed by Title IX simply by proving that male inmates are treated differently, or \neven better, than female inmates in some educational circumstances. For if that conclusion \ncould properly be drawn, then Title IX would require that male and female prisoners receive \nvirtually identical treatment under all circumstances, regardless of the fact that \"[p]risons are \ndifferent from other institutions to which Title IX applies,\" regardless of the fact that \n\"[s]ecurity is an important concern,\" and regardless of the fact that \"sex segregation is the \naccepted norm.\" Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1228. No case has ever interpreted Title IX in such a \nfashion. \nAn example drawn from this case will illustrate the point. In this case, Plaintiffs chose[8] to \noffer evidence limited almost exclusively to NSP. I found in Klinger I that both NSP and \nNCW offered prerelease educational programs of comparable quality, but Title IX, like the \n\nEqual Protection Clause, was violated because NCW did not offer regularly scheduled \nprerelease programs while NSP did. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1411-14 & 1432. Both of \nthese findings were premised upon my determination, later explicitly reversed by Klinger \nII, that one could profitably compare NSP with NCW. \nIf NSP is not comparable, then the absence of regularly scheduled prerelease programs at \nNCW proves virtually nothing. Absent comparability between the institutions, differences in \nthe scheduling of prerelease programs at NSP and NCW may, for example, simply be a \nfunction of NCW having a small number of inmates whose time in prison is relatively short, \nthus impeding for non-gender-related reasons regularity in scheduling. If per capita funding \nis not discriminatory, if NSP is not comparable and if there is little or no evidence, as is this \ncase here, about how male inmates, in smaller all-male prisons, with short sentence \nlengths, are accorded prerelease programs, the court simply lacks any persuasive evidence \nupon which a conclusion can be predicated that the lack of regularly scheduled prerelease \nprograms at NCW occurs on the \"basis of sex,\" as Title IX explicitly requires. \nBecause the Court of Appeals has held as a matter of law that \"comparing programs at \nNSP to those at NCW is like the proverbial comparison of apples to oranges,\" Klinger II, 31 \nF.3d at 733, the evidence in this case, when reexamined in light of Klinger II, fails to \nestablish a Title IX violation. This is 1287*1287 specifically true because (1) the evidence of \ndiscrimination, intentional or otherwise, and whether viewed in light of the Equal Protection \nClause or Title IX, is largely (if not totally) dependent upon a factual comparison of NSP with \nNCW to the exclusion of all other Nebraska prisons, Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 729; Klinger I, 824 \nF.Supp. at 1384 n. 6 & 1388 n. 14; and (2) Plaintiffs do not claim that the allegedly inferior \nprograms at NCW result from discriminatory funding, since Nebraska spends more money \nper capita at NCW than at any other adult prison in its system. Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 731 n. \n2; Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1392-93. \nIn sum, if NSP is not factually comparable to NCW, then \"[d]ifferences between challenged \nprograms at the two prisons are virtually irrelevant because so many variables affect the \nmix of programming that an institution has.\" Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 733. Therefore, since the \nplaintiffs have presented no other relevant or persuasive evidence tending to prove a Title \nIX violation, it follows that the plaintiffs have failed in their burden to prove that the NCW \nwomen were denied educational opportunities in violation of Title IX \"on the basis of sex.\" \nB. \nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) I find and conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to prove a \nviolation of Title IX. Specifically, I find and conclude that there is no relevant or persuasive \nevidence that the women at NCW have been excluded from, denied the benefits of, or \nsubjected to discrimination regarding programs or services \"on the basis of sex.\" Therefore, \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), the contrary findings and conclusions expressed in Klinger \nI, 824 F.Supp. at 1431-34, 1463-64 (findings and conclusions numbered 134-143), and \n1466-67 (findings and conclusions numbered 171-178 to the extent related to Title IX) \nshould be stricken. \nAccordingly, \n\nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. Plaintiffs' Rule 54(b) motion (Filing 704) is denied; \n2. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), the court finds and concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to \nprove a violation of Title IX, as there is no relevant or persuasive evidence that the women \nat NCW have been excluded from, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination \nregarding programs or services \"on the basis of sex\"; \n3. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), the contrary findings and conclusions expressed \nin Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1431-34, 1463-64 (findings and conclusions numbered 134-\n143), and 1466-67 (findings and conclusions numbered 171-178 to the extent related to \nTitle IX) are stricken; \n4. Counsel for the parties are ordered to appear at a status conference in the chambers of \nthe undersigned on the 5th day of June, 1995, at 12:00 noon; \n5. Judgement is withheld. \n[1] In so doing, I hasten to add that I respectfully disagree with the majority opinion in Klinger II. However, my \ndisagreement is irrelevant. My job as a judge of an inferior court is to fairly apply the precedents of the superior \ncourts, whether I agree with them or not. See, e.g., Dronenburg v. Zech, 741 F.2d 1388, 1396 n. 5 (D.C.Cir.1984) \n(Bork, J.); Hillhouse v. Harris, 547 F.Supp. 88, 92-93 (W.D.Ark.1982) (R. Arnold, J., then United States Circuit Judge, \nnow Chief United States Circuit Judge, sitting by designation), aff'd, 715 F.2d 428 (8th Cir.1983). \n[2] Klinger II noted that the State of Nebraska also operated \"two institutions that house both men and women....\" 31 \nF.3d at 729. While Nebraska operates \"coed\" correctional \"institutions\" such as work release centers, the only \nNebraska prison for women is NCW. (See, e.g., Ex. 348, Administrative Regulation for the Department of \nCorrectional Services (DCS)). The mixed \"institutions\" that the Court of Appeals referred to \"hav[e] no security \nperimeter enclosure,\" (Ex. 348 ¶ I E at 3-4 and ¶ II F (Security and Custody Type)), and inmates at these centers are \npermitted to leave the institutions, even staying overnight with family members at times. Id. In fact, in support of an \nargument advanced by defendants I found that evidence of what occurred at these work release centers was \nirrelevant. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1418. \n[3] The plaintiffs did not attack the policy as being per se violative of the Constitution, and thus \"strict scrutiny\" was \nnot an issue. Id. at 1385 & n. 9. \n[4] \"Prerelease\" was a specific program designed to prepare inmates for reentry into society. Id. at 1411-12. I found \nthat an equal protection violation had been established \"since January 1, 1989, by the failure of NCW to provide \nregularly scheduled prerelease programs to its inmates given the fact that NSP inmates were provided with regularly \nscheduled prerelease programs.\" Id. at 1412. \n[5] I was also persuaded that the \"deliberate indifference\" of certain administrators to these differences between NCW \nand NSP helped to prove intentional discrimination. Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1434. If, however, those differences \narose in institutions which are not comparable, then the \"indifference\" of the administrators was, of course, probative \nof nothing. \n[6] The State of Nebraska through DCS also had liability for damages on the Title IX violation since Congress had \nexpressly abrogated the immunity of the states. Id. at 1434 n. 112. \n[7] With sincere respect for the Klinger II majority, this distinction seems very weak to me. It is precisely like the old \nargument that was used to uphold policies that previously prevailed in our public schools which proclaimed that all \nchildren are entitled to an equal education, but African-American children are only entitled to the education they \nreceive at all-black schools which they are required to attend because of their race. While the first policy is facially \n\nneutral, the second and operative policy is not. Moreover, if the majority was looking for written policies that explicitly \ntied programs to gender, the record contained such polices. (See, e.g., Ex. 348 (this regulation of DCS defines \nsecurity type, custody type, inmate type and program offerings at all adult institutions)). Insofar as NCW is concerned, \nthis regulation makes a \"permanent assignment\" of \"all adult female[s]\" to NCW and then lists the programs that are \navailable to them at NCW. (Ex. 348 ¶ II A at 4-5.) Pursuant to that regulation, the programs offered to NCW \nare explicitly different than the programs offered to the men at NSP (and elsewhere). (Compare Ex. 348 ¶ II A at 5 \n(NCW programs) with ¶ II B at 5 (NSP programs)). The purpose of Exhibit 348 was to assign inmates to \n\"appropriately designated security level institutions or facilities,\" not only to maintain \"control,\" but also to \"provide \nopportunities for productivity, growth and development of the individual inmate.\" (Id. (Purpose)). As a consequence, I \ncontinue to convinced that I was confronted with a non-neutral policy which tied programs and services to gender and \naccordingly required the type of scrutiny set forth in such cases as Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. \n718, 731, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 3340, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982). But, no matter what the proper level of scrutiny, it is a \ndifferent question as to whether NSP and NCW are sufficiently comparable that it makes sense to draw inferences \nfrom a comparison between the two institutions. Accordingly, the rejoinder in Klinger II ought not be confused with the \nbasic holding of Klinger II that NCW and NSP were not comparable. Compare Pargo v. Elliott, 49 F.3d 1355 (8th \nCir.1995) (reversing the district court's reliance upon Klinger II, reading Klinger II to be limited to the \"similarly \nsituated\" holding, and recognizing that traditional heightened scrutiny of gender-driven policies may apply in the \nprison context in the proper circumstance.) \n[8] Klinger II, 31 F.3d at 729 (recognizing that plaintiffs limited their comparison group to NSP, and then belatedly and \nunsuccessfully tried to expand the comparison group to all male inmates). See also Klinger I, 824 F.Supp. at 1384 n. \n6 & 1388 n. 14. \n ",
