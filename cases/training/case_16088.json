    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a Native American individual deprived of their right to practice their religion while incarcerated in a Texas prison. On April 13, 1995, a Native American individual incarcerated at the Mountain View Unit (MVU) of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiff sued both TDCJ-ID and MVU officials under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, Article 1 of the Texas Constitution and the Texas Tort Claims Act. Filed pro se and later represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the defendant&rsquo;s conduct violated the law, a preliminary injunction, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and any other reasonable relief. She claimed that defendants deprived her of religious items and restricted her participation in the MVU&rsquo;s weekly sacred pipe ceremony in violation of the law, the primary method by which she could pray and further her beliefs. The items were withheld on the basis that they presented a clear and present danger to prison security, which the plaintiff alleged was inaccurate. Conceding that prison security may nevertheless be a legitimate interest for defendants, the plaintiff claimed the restriction was still illegitimate, because it was greater than necessary to protect that interest.</p>\r\n<p>As litigation progressed, on July 24, 1995, defendants filed a motion for partial dismissal. While the motion was pending before the court, defendants filed another motion on August 7, this time seeking a protective order and to quash some of the plaintiff&rsquo;s discovery requests. This motion was granted in part and denied in part on October 16, and discovery was stayed pending a qualified immunity assessment for some defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Three days later, on December 18, the court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for partial dismissal, and the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims based on the Texas Tort Act were dismissed. The same day, the court entered a scheduling order setting discovery and other deadlines at various points in 1996.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery proceeded through 1996, and in September 1996, both parties submitted their expert witness lists. Though discovery was scheduled to end the first week of January 1997, the plaintiff filed a motion to continue discovery on January 6, 1997, which was granted, resetting the trial for May 1998. On March 4, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss all claims seeking monetary relief from the defendants in their official capacity, which was granted. Claims against two defendants, officials at the TDCJ-ID, were dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On May 6, 1997, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, and for a temporary restraining order (TRO) pending a hearing regarding the preliminary injunction. The court granted the TRO on May 27. Defendants were ordered to 1) revoke the restrictions on the plaintiff&rsquo;s participation in MVU&rsquo;s sacred pipe ceremony for ten days, and 2) allow the plaintiff to participate in three sacred pipe ceremonies. The court found that the harm to the plaintiff and the plaintiff&rsquo;s interest in practicing her religion outweighed defendants&rsquo; interests in security, as they had alternative, less restrictive methods of punishing her. The plaintiff&rsquo;s request for a preliminary injunction was denied on the basis that the restrictions placed on the plaintiff&rsquo;s participation in a weekly sacred pipe ceremony would expire on June 15, 1997. The court found that the plaintiff could not demonstrate irreparable harm after that date, and could request injunctive relief if defendants continued to impose similar restrictions after June 15.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Litigation continued, and on September 9, 1997, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. Two months later, on November 5, 1997, the plaintiff filed a second motion for a preliminary injunction, and requested attorneys&rsquo; fees a few days later. In an order issued on December 29, the court denied both the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction and request for attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, on January 29, 1998, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. However, instead of ruling on the motion, the court entered an order of dismissal on May 5, 1998, dismissing the case without prejudice based on representations that an amicable settlement was being negotiated privately between the parties. Reinstatement was allowed within ninety days if final approval of the settlement could not be obtained. After an extension of time was granted, on October 28, 1998, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the case with prejudice and it was dismissed, with all parties to bear their own costs. As is customary with confidential settlements, no settlement papers were filed with the Court and none are referenced on the docket. Litigation following this case suggests that as part of the settlement, the TDCJ&rsquo;s Chaplaincy Manual was revised to create an exception to the TDCJ tobacco ban for Native American believers at pipe ceremonies. The court granted the order, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. On October 28, 1998, the plaintiff agreed to a stipulation of dismissal which was granted, and the case was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.</p>",

Plaintiff further  alleges  that  defendants  has  denied  all her written  and \nspoken  requests,  as  well  as  her  \"Inmate  Grievances  I-127  & I-128\"  seeking  her \nrights  to practice her religious beliefs. \n4.  On  December  15th,  1993,  PLaintiff received  vias  the U.S.,  Mail,  a  small  pack \nage  of  \"Kinnickinnick''  (A  sacred herb  blessed  by  a  Spiritual Leader)  within com \npliance  with  the  existing I.O.C.,  in effect  at  that  time. \nHowever,  Plaintiff was  informed by  Ms.  Shelton,  a  Unit  Mailroon  Clerk,  that \nChaplain  T.  Crosby,  Unit  Chaplain,  denied  Plaintiff her right  to receive  the \npackage,  thereby violating  their own  I.O.C.,Policy and  depriving Plaintiff of \nher  rights  to practice her Native  American  religion,• and  worship  the  Creator \nin  the  ancestral Ways  of her  People. \n5.  Plaintiff herein would  likewise  show  this honorable  court  that  the  folmowing \nNative  American  Items  are  essential  to her  religious  beliefs: \n1.  Prayer  Pipe.  10.

The  Defendants  has  prohibited plaintiff from  freely  practicing her religion. \n9.  No  compelling  state interest  can  justify the defendants'  interference with \nplaintiffs'  religious  practice.  Prison  security does  not  require  the  defendants \nto deny  plaintiff her religious  items. \n10.  Defendants  conduct  has  deprived  plaintiff of her rights  to  the  free  exercise \nof religion  secured  to her  under  the  First and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution,  as  well  as  the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act  of 1993. \n11.  Even  if the  governmental  interest  is legitimate  and  substantial,  the  rest \nriction is  greater than necessary  to protect the  interest  involved. \n12.  Defendants  has  exhibited reckless  disregard for  plaintiffs'  rights,  and  has \nintentionally and  with deliberate  and  conscious  indifference violated  plaintiffs' \nrights  to religious  freedom. \nINTERFERENCE  WITH  RIGHTS  TO  RECEIVE  RELIGIOUS  ITEMS \n13.  Plaintiff has  ordered  religious  items  which  are  essential  to her  religious \nworship  to be  sent  to her  at her present residence. \n14.  Such  religious  items  has  been  wrongfully withheld  from  plaintiff by  defend \nants. \n15.  Such  materials/religious  items  have  allegedly been withheld  following  a  pur \nported  finding  that  the  items  would  pose  a  danger  to  the  security of  the  prison. \n16.  The  finding  that  such  items would  present  a  clear and  present  danger  to  the \nsecurity of  the  prison was  the  judgment  of defendants  which  was  based  upon  non \nexistent  evidence  to  support  such  finding.  The  decision was  not  made  by  an  im \npartial body  operating within  legal  guidelines  and  with  specific criteria. \n17.  The  items  was  withheld  from  plaintiff with  no  prior notice  or  opportunity \nfor plaintiff to be  heard  on  the matter. \n18.  Defendants'  conduct  deprived plaintiff of her rights  to freedom  of religion \nsecured  to her under  the  First and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution,  as  well  as  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration Act  of 1993. \n\n.. \nCase 4:95-cv-01080   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/95   Page 5 of 6\nTITLE  VI \n19.

The  defendants  is responsible  for  intentional discrimination,  or  in the  al \nternative,  the  facially neutral  practice has  produced  a  significantly adverse \nimpact  on  Ms.Yellowquill's  curtural  group. \nPENDANT  CLAIMS \nA)  FREEDOM  OF  RELIGION: \n22.
