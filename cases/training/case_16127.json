    "summary": "<p>On February 11, 1975, individuals who were incarcerated at an institution called the Central Mississippi Retardation Center (the “Center”) brought this class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against the Center and directors of the Board of Mental Health, Department of Mental Health, and State Hospital for the state of Mississippi. The plaintiffs, represented by a local community legal services group, sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Center housed hundreds of individuals as inmates (many of whom were children) and failed to provide them with adequate care and habilitation. According to the complaint, the Center had failed to ever be accredited by either of the two nationally recognized bodies that evaluate and accredit facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities; as a result the Center was ineligible to receive federal financial assistance. The complaint listed a wide array of substandard conditions including: minimal sunlight, fire hazards, almost no furniture, inadequate ventilation, understaffing, no formal habilitation programs, and heavily restricted visiting hours. Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the Center failed to separate inmates by age or by condition and required some inmates to perform labor without compensation. </p><p>The Plaintiffs argued (1) that these substandard conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and (2) that because the Defendants had both deprived the Plaintiffs of their right to treatment and habilitation and deprived them of an opportunity to challenge the conditions of their confinement, the Defendants had violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Defendants had violated their rights, a permanent injunction to prevent the Defendants from continuing to operate the Center unless it conformed to Constitutional standards, and class certification as “of all persons who are presently or may in the future be incarcerated in the Central Mississippi Retardation Center.” The case was assigned to Judge William Harold Cox.</p><p>In March 1975 the Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) for one of the class action representative plaintiffs. According to the complaint, this plaintiff—an inmate admitted at age 15—had never received any education services despite repeated requests, had no supervised activities and was forced to spend his days wandering from ward to ward, was required to work for minimal compensation, and was transferred to the maximum security unit of the Mississippi State Mental Hospital (as a punishment for fighting) without notice of the charges against him or an opportunity to challenge his transfer. On April 1, 1975, the Court granted the TRO for the duration of the litigation. Although the text of the restraining order is unavailable, it likely addressed these conditions. On the same day, the Court also granted class action certification. </p><p>The case proceeded to discovery, and in November 1975 the Court granted a motion filed by the Mississippi Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. for leave to participate as Amicus Curiae in the lawsuit. On February 18, 1977, the parties filed a joint motion for continuance with a memorandum of understanding. Because the Defendants agreed to make significant improvements to the Center that would moot or substantially narrow the issues, the Plaintiffs agreed to postpone the litigation. Specifically, the Defendants agreed in the memorandum to:</p><p><blockquote>1. Implement food and nutrition recommendations made by a consultant;</p><p>2. Hire a full time physical therapist and obtain necessary equipment;</p><p>3. Hire a full-time pharmacist and follow an individual prescription method of administering medication;</p><p>4. Create and implement full-day developmental programming for residents and review/revise habilitation plans for residents at least every six months;</p><p>5. Hire a full-time speech therapist; and</p><p>6. Maintain and make available the medical records of residents and provide written evidence of the need for transfer before transferring a resident to another facility;</p><p></blockquote>On May 29, 1980, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice. While there is no opinion available, the parties filed a joint motion for dismissal. So it appears that the Defendants took the actions required by the memorandum of understanding. The case is closed. </p>",

The Plaintiffs claimed that the conditions of confinement were so substandard that they amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights; they also claimed that the Center's procedures for intake and transfer of the inmates deprived the Plaintiffs both of their right to habilitation and their right to challenge their confinement, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights. Before the case went to the trial, the parties reached an agreement where the Defendants agreed to make significant improvements to the Center. The Court dismissed the case with prejudice three years later in 1980. ",

This  case  challenges  the  denial,  under  color  of \nstate  law,  of  constitutionally adequate  treatment  and \nhabilitative  services  to  inmates  at  the  Central  Mississippi \nRetardation  Center.  The  case  also  challenges  the  existence \nof  abusive  and  dangerous  conditions  at  the  Center which,  aside \nfrom  the  lack  of  treatment  and  habilitation,  are  harmful  to  the \nphysical  and  emotional  well-being  of  the  inmates. \n2.  The  case  arises  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  the  Civil  Rights \nu.s.c. \nAct  of  1871,  42  §1983.  A  declaratory  judgment  is  sought \npursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§2201-2202. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n3.  This  court  has  jurisdiction pursuant  to  28  u.s.c. \n§§1331  and  1343(3).  The  amount  in controversy  for  each  of  the \nnamed  plaintiffs  and  for  each member  of  their  class  exceeds \n$10,000,  exclusive  of  interest  and  costs. \nIII.  PARTIES \nA.

Plaintiff Doe  brings \nthis  action by  and  through  his  next  friends,  Ruby  Jones,  Samuel \nWilliams,  Michael  Raff,  and  Richard  Abraham. \n-2-\n\n5.  Plaintiff Richard  Roe  is  a  twenty-two  year  old \nresident  of Hinds  County,  Mississippi who  is  presently \nincarcerated  in  the  Central  Mississippi  Retardation  Center. \nPlaintiff Roe  brings  this  action  by  and  through  his  next \nfriends,  Robert  Thomas,  Jeanne  Barnard,  Patricia Derian. \n6.  Plaintiffs  John  Doe  and  Richard  Roe  sue  under \nfictitious  names  to  protect  their  true  identit ies.  It  is \nplaintiffs'  belief  that  the  use  of  their names  will  subject \nthem  to  humiliation,  intimidation  and  embarrassment.  Sealed \naffidavits  containing plaintiffs'  true  identities will be  filed \nwith  the  court  upon  request. \nB.  Class  Action \n7.  Plaintiffs  Doe  and  Roe  bring  this  action  on  behalf \nof  themselves  and,  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(1)  and  (b)(2)  of \nthe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  on  behalf  of  all  persons \nwho  are  presently or may  in  the  future  be  incarcerated  in  the \nCentral  Mississippi  Retardation  Center.  The  class  presently \nconsists  of more  than  850  persons  and  is  therefore  so  numerous \nthat  joinder  of  all members  is  impracticable. \n8.  The  claims  asserted by  plaintiffs  Doe  and  Roe  to \nreceive  adequate  treatment  and  habilitation  and  to  be  free \nfrom  abusive  and  harmful  conditions  present  questions  of  law \nand  fact which  are  common  to  all members  of  their  class.  The \nclaims  asserted by  plaintiffs  Doe  and  Roe  are  typical  of  the \nclaims  of  the  class.  Plaintiffs  Doe  and  Roe  have  no  conflict \nof  interest with  t he  members  of  their  class  and  plaintiffs  are \nrepresented  by  competent  counsel  who  are  experienced  in  the \nconduct  of  litigation  on  behalf  of  the  rights  of  the  mentally \nhandicapped.  Therefore,  plaintiffs  Doe  and  Roe  will  fairly  and \n-3-\n\nadequately  protect  the  interests  of  the  class. \n9.  The  prosecution  of  separate  actions  against  defendants \ncould  create  a  risk  of  inconsis.tent  or  varying  adjudications \nwith  respect  to  individual  class  members  which would  establish \nincompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  defendants.  Separate \nadjudications  with  respect  to  plaintiffs would  as  a  practical \nmatter  be  dispositive  of  the  interests  of  the  members oof  the \nclass.  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds \ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby making  appropriate \nfinal  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief with  respect  to  the \nclass  as  a  whole. \nC.  Defendants \n10.  Defendants  SETH  HUDSPETH,  A.B.  ALBRITTON,  DUANE \nBURGIS,  BERNICE  HALE,  L.G.  HOPKINS,  GWENDOLYN  LOPER,  GILBERT \nMACVAUGH,  JR.,  EUGENE  MCLEMORE  and  J .C.  WILLIAMSON  are  sued \nin  their  official  capacities  as  the  Chairman  and  Members  of \nthe  Mississippi  State  Board  of Mental  Health.  The  Board  has \nfinal  responsibility  for  administering,  through  the  State \nDepartment  of Mental  Health,  all  state  facilities  for  the \nill and  mentally  retarded,  including  the  Central Mississippi \nRetardation  Center. \n11.  Defendant  REGINALD  P.  WHITE  is  sued  in  his  official \ncapacity as  the  executive  director  of  the  State Department  of \nMental  Health.  He  is  the  chief  executive  and  administrative \nofficer  of  the  Department. \n12.  Defendant  PAUL  COTTEN  is  sued  in his  official \ncapacity as  the  Director  of  the  Division  of Mental  Retardation \nof  the  Department  of Mental  Health.  The  Division  is  responsible \nwithin  the  Department  for  all  activities  and  programs  concerning \nthe  mentally  retarded. \n-4-\n\n13.  Defendant  C.B.  NOBLIN  is  sued  in his  official \ncapacity  as  the  Director  of  the  Central  Mississippi  Retardation \nCenter.  He  is  responsible  for  the  overall  supervision  and \nadministration  of  the  Center  on  a  daily basis. \n14.  Defendant W.L.  JAQUITH  is  sued  in his  official \ncapacity  as  the  Superintendent  of  the  Mississippi  State Hospital \nin Whitfield,  Mississippi.  He  is  responsible  for  the  provision \nof  medical  and  dental  care  to  all  inmates  of  the  Central \nMississippi  Retardation  Center. \nIV.  STATEMENT  OF  THE  CASE \n15.  The  Central  Mississippi  Retardation  Center  (hereafter \n\"Retardation Center\")  was  opened  as  an  annex  to  the  Mississippi \nState Hospital  in  Mt.ssissippi  in 1962.  The  present \nresident  population  of  the  Retardation  Center  is  approximately \n850,  almost  300  of whom  are  children  of  school  age  or younger. \nIn  recent  years,  virtually all  new  admissions  have  been  children. \nAll  of  these  inmates  are  being  held  at  the  Retardation  Center \nwithout  the  care  and  treatment  which  they  desperately need  and \nunder  conditions  which  cause  serious  and  irreparable  harm  to \nthe:irphysical  and  emotional  well-being. \n16.  The  Retardation  Center  is  composed  of  twelve,  one \nfloor  brick buildings,  surrounded by  a  tall  cyclone  fence  with \nbarbed wire.  There  are  no  shade  trees  or bushes  inside  the  fence, \nand  the  grounds  are  bare  dirt. \n17.  Each  of  the  ten  residential  buildings  is  divided  into \ntwo  wards  with  a  central  nurses'  station.  In  each ward  there  are \napproximately  forty  iron  cots  arranged  in  three  lines.  The  cots \nare  less  than  two  feet  apart.  There  are  no  screens  or  curtains \nfor  privacy and  there  is  insufficient  space  to  store  the  inmates' \nclothing  and  personal  belongings .  The  walls  are  bare.  There  is \n-5-\n\n--...__. \nonly  one  door  to  each ward,  which  presents  a  fire  hazard when \nlocked.  Except  for  several  hard-backed  chairs,  there  are  no \ntables,  lamps  or  other  furniture  in  the  wards. \n18.  The  residential  buildings  have  virtually no  venti-\nlation.  During  the  summer,  the  wards  become  unbearably  hot, \ncausing  patients  to  have  convulsions.  The  residential  buildings \nare  not  adequately  heated  and  they  become  uncomfortably  cold \nduring  the  winter.  The  buildings  are  permeated  by  fecal  and  other \nhuman  odors.  / \n19.  Inmates  at  the  Retardation  Center  are  placed  in wards \nwithout  regard  to  their  illness,  degree  of  impairment,  dangerous-\nness,  physical  handicap  or need  for  attention.  Children  of  all \nages  are  kept  in adult wards.  As  a  result,  younger  and  more \ndocile  inmates  are  subjected  to  harrassment,  beatings  and  sexual \nassaults  by  the  more  aggressive  inmates. \n20.  The  Retardation Center  is  grossly understaffed and \nconsequently  is  unable  to  provide  even  minimally  adequate  super-\nvision  for  the  inmates.  Each  ward  building,  containing  eighty \nor more  inmates,  is  maintained  by  five  attendants  during  the  day \nand  three  during  the  night.  These  attendants  have  no  specialized \ntraining  to  enable  them  to  provide  care  and  treatment  to  the \nretarded  inmates,  and  the  Retardation  Center  provides  no  orienta-\ntion  or  staff  training  for  them.  There  are  no  trained personnel \nto  supervise  the  attendants  at  any  time.  Instead,  during  each \nshift,  there  is  a  single  nurse,  with  no  special  training  or \nexperience  in  the  care  of  retarded persons,  who  is  in  charge  of \nall  850  inmates. \n21.  Inmates  are  routinely  admitted  to  the  Retardation \nCenter without  any  evaluation  of  their needs,  including  the \npossibility of  less  restrictive  treatments  in  their  own  communitieq. \nMoreover,  contrary  to  accepted medical  practice,  the  Retardation \nCenter  does  not  attempt  to  develop  or  follow  an  individualized \n-6-\n\nhabilitation plan  identifying  the  specific  needs  of  each  inmate \nand  implementing  a  program  to  meet  these  needs.  To  serve  all \n850  inmates,  there  are  only  one  psychologist  and  one  medical \ndoctor,  who  are  shared with  the  Mississippi  State Hospital,  and \none  consulting psychiatrist,  who  has  an  additional  full-time \npractice  in Jackson.  The  Retardation  Center  does  not  maintain \nadequate  records  to  enable  it to  monitor  each  inmate's  progress \nand  development. \n22.  Almost  all  inmates  assigned  to  the  Retardation  Center \nare  capable  of  returning  to  their  own  families  and  communities  if \ngiven  suitable  training  and  educational  services.  The  educational \nand  vocational  services  available  at  the  Retardation  Center  are \nso  inadequate,  however,  that  the  abilities  of  many  inmates \nsubstantially deteriorate  during  their  incarceration,  and  a \nsignificant number  are  never  able  to  leave  the  institution. \nThere  is  no  library at  the  Center  and  only  two  small  classrooms. \nThere  are  only  five  special  education  teachers who  serve  a  total \nof  approximately  150  inmates  for  one  or  two  hours  a  day.  The \nremaining  700  inmates  receive  no  education  or  training  at  all. \nThere  are  only  five  occupational  therapists  for  the  entire  residen \npopulation.  There  is  one  physical  therapist,  who  works  with \napproximately  fifty profoundly  retarded  inmates. \n23.  Because  there  is  no  organized  program  for  them, \ninmates  at  the  Retardation  Center  spend  most  of  their  days  sitting \nalone  and  idle  in  the  wards  or wandering  around  the  grounds  and \nbuildings.  There are hardly  any  recreational  equipment  or  toys \nfor  young  children.  All  inmates  are  confined  to  their wards  at \n4  P.M.  each  day,  where  they must  remain,  regardless  of  the \nweather,  until  .the  next  morning. \ng!f.  Regular  contacts  with  an  inmate's  family  are  an \nessential  part  of  any  suitable habilitation program  if  the  inmate \nis  to  be  able  to  return  to  his  or  her  community.  Inmates  at  the \n-7-\n\nRetardation  Center,  however,  are  denied  access  to  a  telephone, \nand  visiting hours  are  so  restricted as  to  be  virtually unavail-\nable  to  working  parents  except  on  weekends .  Virtually no \ncommunication  between  staff and  parents  takes  place.  Parents \nare  not  informed  of  their  children's  diagnosis,  the  treatment \nprovided  to  them,  including medication,  and  their progress,  if \nany.  To  work  with  the  families  of  all  850  inmat es,  there  is \nonly  one  social worker,  who  is  shared with  the  Mississippi  State \nHospital. \n25.  Instead  of  individualized habilitation programs \ndesigned  to  educate  and  train  them,  inmates  at  the  Retardation \nCenter  are  subjected  to  numerous  cruel  practices which  are \ndirectly contrary  to  their habilitation.  Tranquilizing medication \nis  administered  to  almost  all  inmates  by  untrained  attendants \nor  sometimes  by  other patients,  although  the  use  of  such  drugs \non  retarded persons  is  contrary  to  accepted medical  practice. \nElectroshock  and  physical  restraints  are  also  used,  although \nthey  violate  every  standard  of  accepted  treatment  for  the  retarded \n26.  Inmates  at  the  Retardation  Center  are  routinely \npunished by  summary  confinement  for  indeterminate  periods  in \nsolitary \"punishment  rooms\"  which  have  no  toilet  or  sleeping \nfacilities.  Where  attendants  believe  that more  severe  punishment \nis  inmates  are  summarily  transferred  to  the  maximum \nsecurity unit  at  the  Mississippi  State Hospital,  where  they  are \nkept  with  inmates  who  have  been  transferred  from  the  State \nPenitentiary and  criminal  defendants  who  have  been  found  to  be \nincompetant  to  stand  trial.  At  no  time  before  or  after  the \ninstitution of  punishment  are  inmates  at  the  Retardation  Center \nprovided with  adequate  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge \nthe  punishment. \n27.  Inmates  at  the  Retardation  Center  do  not  receive \nregular medical  checkups  and  there  are  no  medical  personnel \nlocated at  the  Center.  Consequently,  all  but  the  most  aggravated \n-8-\n\nedical  needs  go  undetected  and  untreated.  There  is  one  dentist, \nshared with  the  State  Hospital,  who  is  responsible  for  more  than \n4000  inmates  at  the  two  institutions. \n28.  The  Retardation  Center  has  never  been  accredited by \nthe  Joint  Commission  on  Accreditation  of Hospitals  or  the \n!Accreditation  Council  for  Facilities  for  the  Mentally  Retarded, \nthe  two  nationally  recognized bodies  that  evaluate  and  accredit \nfacilities  for  the  mentally  retarded.  Because  of  the  substandard \nconditions,  the  Retardation  Center  is  not  eligible  to  receive \nfederal  financial  assistance  for  itself or  for  its  inmates. \n29.  While  most  inmates  remain  idle,  some  inmates  at  the \nRetardation  Center  are  required  to  perform  labor  involving \nmaintenance  and  operation  of  the  institution,  for which  they \nreceive  no  compensation  and  which  serves  no  habilitative  purpose. \nThese  chores  include  the  mopping  and  sweeping  of wards,  feeding \nand  bathing  other  inmates,  and washing  their  own  and  employee's \npersonal  clothes. \n30.  Plaintiff John  Doe  was  admitted  to  the  Retardation \nCenter  pursuant  to  an  order  of  two  physicians  of  Hinds  County \nwhen  he  was  seventeen years  old. \n31.  Although  he  has  been  incarcerated  at  the  Retardation \nCenter  continuously  for  more  than  three  years,  plaintiff Doe  has \nnever  received  any  psychological  evaluation  or  any  other  assess-\nment  of  his  needs.  The  Center  has  never  formulated  a  habilitation \nplan  for  him,  and  only  a  few  incomplete  records  have  been kept \nto  monitor  his  progress. \n32.  Plaintiff Doe  is  regarded  as  \"severely  retarded\"  by \nthe  Retardation  Center.  He  is  almost  never  permitted  to  leave \nhis  ward  and,  consequently,  he  receives  no  educational  services \nor physical  recreation  of  any  In  stead  of  improying, \nplaintiff Doe's  condition has  deteriorated  drastically since  he \n-9-\n\nentered  the  Retardation  Center.  At  the  time  of  his  placement, \nhe  could  speak many words,  could  communicate  his  needs,  dress \nhimself,  and  control  his  bodily  functions.  Now,  he  has  lost \nthese  abilities  completely. \n33.  Plaintiff Doe  has  been  subjected  to  serious  physical \nabuse  during  his  incarceration at  the  Retardation  Center,  includ-\ning  electroshock,  physical  beatings  and  excessive  and  unwarranted \ndrugs.  In November  1973,  his  mother  discovered  that  plaintiff \nDoe's  back was  covered with  large  red welts,  as  if he  had  been \nbeaten. by  a  belt.  In  January  1974,  she  took  him  to  the  University \nof Mississippi  Medical  Center  for  a  special  examination  because \nhe  seemed  unusually  sleepy  and  lethargic.  Doctors  at  the  Medical \nCenter  informed  her  that  he  had  received an  overdose  of  tran-\nquilizing  drugs. \n34.  Plaintiff Richard  Roe  was  admitted  to  the  Retardation \nCenter  pursuant  to  an  order  transferring  from  Ellisville Schoo \nwhen  he  was  fifteen years  old. \n35.  At  no  time  since  his  admission  has  the  Retardation \nCenter  developed  an  individualized habilitation plan  for  plaintiff \nRoe.  Although  he  has  received  a  score  of  61  on  an  I.Q.  test, \nwhich  is well  within  the  range  of  the  educable  mentally  retarded, \nplaintiff Roe  has  never  received  any  education  services  despite \nrepeated  requests  by  himself  and  his  parents  that  he  be  taught \nto  read  and write. \n36.  With  the  exception  of  a  short  outdoor  exercise  period \nduring  good weather,  plaintiff Roe  has  no  supervised  or planned \nactivities.  He  spends  most  of  his  days  wandering  from  ward  to \nward.  He  is  often  required  to  mop  and  sweep  his  ward  and  to  carry \nother patients  to  the  bath  or  toilet.  He  occasionally  receives \none  to  four  dimes  for  this  labor. \n-10-\n\n'----\n37.  In  1968  ,  plaintiff Roe  was  summarily  incarcerated \nin  the  maximum  security unit  of  the  Mississippi  State  Hospital. \nThe  action was  not  part  of  any  habilitation program,  but was \nsolely  to  punish  plaintiff Roe  for  fighting.  Plaintiff Roe  was \nnever  given  notice  of  the  charges  against  him  or  an  opportunity \nto  challenge  his  transfer  to  the  State Mental  Hospital. \n38.  Plaintiff Roe  has  also  been  subjected  to  physical \nbeatings  by members  of  the  Retardation  Center  staff. \nV.  CAUSES  OF  ACTION \n39.  By  confining  plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  their \nclass  under  the  abusive  and  harmful  conditions  existing  in  the \nCentral  Mississippi  Retardation  Center,  defendants  inflict  cruel \nand  unsual  punishment  upon  plaintiffs  and  their class  in violation \nof  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  and  42  U.S.C.  §1983. \n40.  By  fai ling  to  provide  plaintiffs  and  the  members  of \ntheir  class  with  adequate  care  and  habilitation  sufficient  to \nenable  them  to  lead more  useful  and  meaningful  lives  and  to \nreturn  to  society,  defendants  have  deprived  plaintiffs  and  their \nclass  of  the  right  to  treatment  and  habilitation  afforded  by \nthe  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution  and  42  U.S.C.  §1983. \n41.  By  failing  to  provide  plaintiffs  and  the  members  of \ntheir  class with  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  all  forms \nof  punishment  including  confinement  in  the  solitary punishment \nrooms  and  transfer  to  the  maximum  security unit  of  the  Mississippi \nState Hospital,  defendants  have  deprived plaintiffs  and  the  member, \nof  their  class  of  their  liberty without  due  process  of  law  in \nviolation  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  and  42  U.S.C.  §1983. \n-11-\n\nVI.  EQUITY \n42.  Unless  restrained by  this  court,  defendants  will \ncontinue  to  inflict  immediate,  serious  and  irreparable  harm \nto  the  physical  and  ment al  well-being  of  each  of  the  plaintiffs \nand  each member  of  their  class.  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate \nremedy  at  law. \nVII.  RELIEF \nerefore,  plaintiffs  pray  that  this  court: \n1.  Certify  this  action  as  a  class  action  pursuant \nto  Rule  23(c)(1),  F.R.  Civ.  P.; \n2.  Issue  a  declaratory  judgment  declaring  that \ndefendants  are  administering  the  Central \nMississippi  Retardation  Center  in  a  manner \nand  under  conditions  which  violate  the  Eighth \nand  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution; \n3.  Issue  a  permanent  injunction  enjoining  defendants, \ntheir  successors  in office,  their  agents,  employees, \nand  all  others  in active  concert  and  participation \nwith  them  from  continuing  to  operate  the  Central \nMississippi  Retardati on  Center  in  a  manner \nthat  does  not  conform  to  constitutional  standards \nof  delivering  adequate  care  and  habilitation  to \nits  inmates,  and  requiring  defendants  to  prepare \nwithin  a  reasonable  period  of  time,  a  compre-\nhensive,  specific  and  constitutionally accept-\nable  plan  to  provide  adequate  care  andhabili-\ntation  to  all  inmates  at  the  Central  Mississippi \nRetardation  Center; \n-12-\n\n-\n,, \n'---\" \n4.  Award  plaintiffs  reasonable  attorneys'  fees \nand  costs; \n5.  Grant  such  other  relief  as  may  be  fair and \nequitable. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nDAVID  SETH  MICHAELS \nBARRY  H.

J75-36 (C) \n) \n) \nSETH  HUDSPETH,  et  al. ,  ) \nDefendants  ) \nMEMORANDUM  OF  UNDERSTANDING \nTrial in this case having been  set for  February  22,  1977, \nthe  parties hereto,  by their undersigned counsel,  do  hereby  state: \nI.  That,  subject to  paragraph III,  infra,  plaintiffs  and \ndefendants  shall jointly request that the  Court continue the  trial \nof this action  until defendants  have  completed the  previously com-\nmenced repair  and renovation of the  10  residential cottages and \nthe  activity building of the  Central Mississippi Retardation  Center \n(hereafter  \"Hudspeth Center\"),  or  until July  1,  1978,  whichever \nis  earlier. \nII.  The  plaintiffs  have  agreed to join the  defendants in \na  request for  a  continuance of the  trial in consideration of the  defen-\ndants'  representations  that they  have undertaken or  plan to undertake \nthe  following  actions relating to conditions  at the  Hudspeth  Center: \n\nA.  FOOD  AND  NUTRITION  SERVICES \n(1)  Defendants  have  employed two  dietary consultants  who \nhave visited  the  Hudspeth Center and the  Mississippi  State  Hospital \nfor  purposes of making recommendations  as  to  the  management, \nprocessing and  delivery of food  at the  Hudspeth  Center.  The \ndefendants  expect to  receive  the  written reports and recommenda \ntions  of these  consultants by March  15,  1977.  Copies of these \nreports will be  provided to  counsel for  plaintiffs,  who shall submit \ntheir  response to  the  recommendations  within fifteen  days of receipt \nof them.  Defendants  will take  all reasonable  and necessary  steps \nto  implement the  recommendations of the  consultants by September \n30,  1977. \n(2)  Defendants  have  assessed their current budgetary \nsituation and will  make  the  necessary application to the  Budget \nand Accounting  Commission  to  enable them  to  employ a  full-time \ndietitian  at  the  Hudspeth Center  during the  current fiscal  year. \n(3)  All residents  are being fed  in a  sitting and upright \nposition  and will  continue  to  be  so fed. \n(4)  Defendants will  continue to  train residents to  use knives \nand forks  as  fast  as  possible. \nB.  PHYSICAL  THERAPY  SERVICES \n(1)  Defendants  have available  a  position for  a  full-time \nphysical therapist in the  current budget which they have been \nunable to  fill.  Defendants  will continue their  efforts  to  employ \na  physical therapist by  contacting any sources  suggested to  them \nby the  plaintiffs.  In addition,  defendants will  petition the  State \nClassification Commission to  increase the  salary schedule for \nphysical therapists to  make it competitive in the  Jackson Metro \npolitan area.
