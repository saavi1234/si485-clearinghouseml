In the absence of such relief, the parties will be ready to resume discovery as soon as the appeals are resolved, while granting the motion will cause additional delay. It is reasonable to require the defendants to take the steps necessary to avoid exacerbating the needless delays they have already caused. However, that result can be achieved by granting the alternative relief the defendants propose of a 45-day extension of the time to answer. There is no reasonable prospect of the appeals being resolved by the deadline the Batalla Vidal plaintiffs suggest (April 20, 2018). Accordingly, I deny the defendants' request for an indefinite stay, but grant their alternative request of a 45-day extension. The defendants' shall file their amended answers by May 29, 2018.

No later than September 22, 2017, the parties shall report their respective positions on the threshold question of whether discovery should proceed now or await the resolution of the defendants' anticipated motion for dismissal. By the same date, the parties shall submit their respective scheduling proposals in the event discovery is not stayed, as well as a proposed schedule for litigating any specific discovery disputes that the parties have identified as likely to arise. I will expect the parties to be prepared to discuss all matters relating to discovery at the next conference on September 26, 2017. In light of the fact that the parties to the Batalla Vidal action have agreed to the filing of a second amended complaint that will include claims that overlap with those already asserted in State of New York action, I encourage the plaintiffs' counsel in the latter case to participate in the meet-and-confer process in the former. Although issue has not yet been joined in the State of New York action, the participation of counsel from that case in the discovery planning process in the Batalla Vidal action will help to avoid needless burdens on the parties in each case. I therefore invite counsel for the parties in the State of New York action to appear at the conference in the Batalla Vidal action on September 26, 2017, and to participate in the discussion of issues relating to the discovery process.

    "summary": "<p>Sixteen states, led by the State of New York, filed this lawsuit against the federal government on September 6, 2017, in response to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum issued on September 5, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The states argued that ending DACA violated due process and equal protection rights, and also violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The states sought to enjoin the federal government from carrying out portions of the DHS memorandum and from using information about DACA grantees gathered in their applications to enforce immigration policy. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and assigned to Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis. </p><p>  </p><p>The complaint asserted that DACA helped its beneficiaries in several ways. First, since its inception in 2012, DACA protected approximately 800,000 young people from deportation. Second, DACA allowed individuals brought to the United States as children who met specific criteria to request deferred action for two years, subject to renewal. Indeed, the states pointed out that many of the grantees have spent most of their lives in the United States. Third, DACA allowed grantees to receive public benefits like social security, to enroll in higher education institutions, and to access other benefits like opening up a bank account and buying a car. And finally, the states noted that the federal government represented that it would not use the information obtained in the DACA application process to enforce immigration policy. </p><p>     </p><p>The states argued that these grantees would now lose their protections and be at risk of deportation, especially since they provided the federal government with sensitive information in their applications. In light of the DHS memorandum, the federal government planned to immediately stop accepting new DACA applications. Further, it only issued renewals for grantees whose terms expired before March 5, 2018, provided they apply for renewal by October 5, 2018. The states highlighted that in addition to the losses DACA grantees will suffer, state and local economies, as well as many higher education institutions, have come to rely on the skills and productivity of the grantees and will therefore also suffer. The states pointed out that over half of DACA grantees are of Mexican origin and thus ending DACA \"is a culmination of President’s Trump’s oft-stated commitments...to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\" Further, the states argued that the grantees' sensitive information is at risk since President Trump took \"affirmative steps to reduce the privacy protections applicable to DACA data\" with a January 2017 Executive Order directing all agencies to \"exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information\" Meanwhile, the states pointed out that the DHS Memorandum did not provide assurance to DACA grantees or direction to USCIS and ICE that this information could not be used for the purpose of immigration policy enforcement.  </p><p>  </p><p>Originally, the plaintiffs consisted of New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, District Of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia. Then Colorado joined as part of an amended complaint filed on October 4, which also claimed that the United States was equitably estopped from using or disclosing DACA beneficiaries’ personal information that it previously promised to keep confidential.   </p><p>                </p><p>On October 6, the United States filed a partial administrative record in the related case <a href = \"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a>, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0051-0008.pdf\">here</a>. The record included a series of government documents pertaining to DACA from its inception to the decision to rescind it. The <i>Batalla Vidal</i> plaintiffs then moved to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record, arguing that the defendants had not produced all of the documents leading to the rescission. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that they omitted documents that Acting Secretary Duke did not directly review. The judge in <i>Batalla Vidal</i> (also Judge Garaufis) granted the motion on October 19 and ordered the defendants to produce the full administrative record in both cases. </p><p>The defendants appealed to the Second Circuit, which granted an emergency motion for a stay of discovery and record supplementation in the district court pending consideration by the Second Circuit on October 20.</p><p>On October 27, the defendants filed a motion in the district court to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, arguing that the rescission was an enforcement action \"presumed immune from judicial review\" and that, alternatively, the government provided ample explanation for the rescission.</p><p>On November 9, 2017, the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims that policy changes in how information provided for DACA applications could be used violated due process and equitable estoppel. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs' claim that the government violated due process by failing to provide individualized notice of the rescission. In both cases, the court determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The court found, however, that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the DACA rescission. The court reserved ruling on the government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and denied all other parts of its motion. </p><p>  </p><p>On December 15, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the government from rescinding DACA. </p><p>  </p><p>Meanwhile, a series of entities filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs: United We Dream, over 100 companies, educational justice organizations, the Fred T. Korematsu Center for Law and Equality, law enforcement leaders, workers' organizations, legal services organizations, New York University, the Mexican government, dozens of religious organizations, immigration nonprofits, various U.S. cities and counties, and civil rights organizations.</p><p>  </p><p>On December 27, the Second Circuit lifted the stay on the district court's discovery orders. But the government still did not want to provide additional documents. It also wanted to appeal the district court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss. So, two days later, the government moved to stay further supplementation of the administrative record in the district court pending its appeal on the motion to dismiss. The district court granted the government’s motion to stay on December 30. It then certified the government’s interlocutory appeal on January 8. </p><p>On February 13, 2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a  preliminary injunction, reasoning that the government likely lacked a legally sufficient basis for ending the DACA program. The court found that while the government could end DACA, the question was if they had provided legally adequate reasons for rescission. The court found that the decision to end DACA was based on an erroneous conclusion that DACA was unconstitutional and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that this conclusion in turn relied on the \"plainly incorrect factual premise\" that courts have found the \"somewhat analogous\" Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program to have \"constitutional defects.\" The court also found that the purported reason for rescission was contradictory in that the government claimed DACA must end because it was unconstitutional, and yet also provided for a wind-down period in which certain DACA renewal applications would continue to be adjudicated. As a result, the court held that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and enjoined the government from ending the program on a nationwide basis pending the court's decision on the merits of the case.      </p><p>  </p><p>The government filed notice on February 20 that it had appealed the district court’s decision to issue a preliminary injunction to the Second Circuit. </p><p>On February 21, 2018, the Second Circuit again denied the defendants' request for a stay of the district court's discovery orders.</p><p>On March 29, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim that the rescission violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement for notice-and-comment, finding that the rescission memorandum was a general statement of policy exempt from the notice-and-comment requirement rather than a legislative rule. This finding led the court to further dismiss the plaintiffs' claim regarding Regulatory Flexibility Act violations since an RFA violation is contingent on a notice-and-comment requirement in the first place. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs' claim that the government changed its information-use policy but left the door open to other challenges of that policy. The court sustained the plaintiffs' equal protection claim that the rescission was motivated by racial animus against Latinos, finding that the plaintiffs adequately alleged the rescission created disparate impact. Further, the court found that while the plaintiffs may not have sufficiently alleged that Acting Secretary Duke or the Attorney General had discriminatory intent, they did sufficiently allege that President Trump may have had such intent and that his influence on the rescission could not be ignored. </p><p>  </p><p>The government promptly appealed the March 29 district court order denying its motion to dismiss. The Second Circuit decided to hear the government’s appeal in tandem with the appeal of the preliminary injunction and the appeal of the district court’s November 9, 2017, decision on the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and similar appeals in <i>Batalla Vidal</i>. </p><p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court agreed to hear three consolidated DACA cases: <i>Batalla Vidal</i>, <i>Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California</i>, and <i>Trump v. NAACP</i> (see related cases). </p><p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS’s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. </p><p>On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act and that the rescission was unlawful. 140 S.Ct. 1891. In accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision, the Second Circuit vacated the district court’s order granting preliminary injunction and affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s denial of the government’s motion to dismiss. </p><p>On July 28, 2020, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. </p><p>In response, on August 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting DHS Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. Accordingly, the plaintiffs alleged that the government’s implementation of the memorandum was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of DHS’ statutory authority, and that it violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Homeland Security Act, which prohibit agency action by unlawfully serving acting officials from taking effect. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the Acting Secretary was unlawfully serving in his position, to invalidate the memorandum, and to enjoin the government from terminating, amending, or interfering with DACA.</p><p>The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on August 28, 2020. Shortly thereafter, the government filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. On November 14, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion and denied the government’s cross-motion, finding that the Acting DHS Secretary was not lawfully serving in his position and thus that the government's implementation of the memorandum was arbitrary and capricious. 2020 WL 6695076. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed another partial motion for summary judgment on November 24, 2020. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion on December 4, 2020, vacating the memorandum issued by the Acting Secretary of DHS and ordering DHS to resume processing DACA applications and to notify the public accordingly. 2020 WL 7121849.  The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years.  On December 7, 2020 <a href = \"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca\">USCIS</a> updated their website and indicated that effective that day, USCIS would accept initial applications, extend one-year DACA renewals to two-years, and accept applications for advance parole.</p><p>As of December 19, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Duke (Sept. 5, 2017) (\"Rescission Memorandum\").\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 133   Filed 12/21/17   Page 7 of 25 PageID #: 6437\nmade available to all on equal teems.\" Id. at 222-223 (citing Brown v. Board ofE  ducation, 347\nU. S. 483, 493 (1954)) (emphasis added). If the Rescission Memorandum is enforced, hundreds\nof thousands of undocumented K-12 students will suffer irreparable educational injury and will\nbe deprived of the ability to obtain a K-12 public education on equal terins with their U.S.-born\npeers.\nPrior to the enactment of the \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" (\"DACA\")\nprogram, the educational prospects of undocumented children were significantly curtailed by\ntheir immigration status, which often prevented them from gaining access to many of the\nacademic resources available to their U.S.-born peers. The implementation of DACA in 2012,\nhowever, rapidly expanded undocumented young people's future opportunities, incentivizing\nthem to work harder, complete high school, and gain admission to colleges and universities.\nDACA has also allowed undocumented adolescents to take part in many rites of passage, such\nworking legally and securing an internship, which position students to pursue long term\neducational and career goals. Critically, DACA has eliminated the daily fear of arrest and\ndeportation among recipients. As a result, undocumented K-12 students have enjoyed better\nmental health, allowing them to focus on their studies rather than their worries and anxiety. If\nthe Rescission Memorandum is not enjoined, undocumented students will be stripped of many\nresources that supported their academic success in recent years, and schools across the nation\nwill face significant obstacles in educating and mentoring these students.\nDACA has also provided significant educational benefits to U.S.-born children. DACA's\nwork authorization allows parents who are DACA recipients to better provide for their families,\nhelping their children gain access to valuable educational resources. Additionally, parents who\nare not threatened with deportation are more likely than their undocumented counterparts to take\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 133   Filed 12/21/17   Page 8 of 25 PageID #: 6438\nadvantage of public benefits that help children thrive and succeed academically. DACA\nprovides psychological relief to children who previously lived in constant fear that their parents\nwould be deported, thereby improving their performance at school. Furthermore, thousands of\nK-12 students are currently taught by DACA-recipient teachers who bring unique skills to the\nclassroom. If the Rescission Memorandum is not enjoined, U.S.-born children of DACA\nrecipients will be snore likely to live in poverty and to suffer from mental health problems,\nimpairing their ability to succeed in school, and students who are taught by DACA-recipient\nteachers will be deprived of highly effective educators.\nA preliminary injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing the Rescission\nMemorandum is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to K-12 students and is in the public\ninterest.\nARGUMENT\nI.  ENDING DACA WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE EDUCATIONAL INJURY TO\nK-12 STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED DACA OR WHO\nWOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DACA\nIn Plyler v. Doe, the Court recognized that educating the next generation of adults is\n\"perhaps the most important function of state and local goverrunents.\" 457 U.S. at 222-223\n(citing Brown, 347 U.S. at 493). The Migration Policy Institute (\"MPI\") estimates that at least\n130,000 DACA recipients are currently in high school,3 and hundreds of thousands of\nelementary and middle school students will become eligible to receive DACA in coming years.4\nIf the Rescission Memorandum is not enjoined, these students will lose their motivation to\nsucceed academically, be ostracized from mainstream society, and will experience increased\n3 Jie Zong, et al., A ProTle of Current DACA Recipients by Education, Industry, and Occupation,\nMPI Fact Sheet, 4 (Nov. 2017).\n4 Randy Capps, et al., The Education and Worlc Profiles of the DACA Population, MPI Issue\nBrief, 3 (Aug. 2017).\n3\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 133   Filed 12/21/17   Page 9 of 25 PageID #: 6439\nmental health problems.  As a result, public schools across the country will encounter significant\nchallenges in fulfilling their duty to educate hundreds of thousands of K-12 students.\nA.  If the Rescission Memorandum Is Not Enjoined, Barriers to Higher\nEducation and Legal Employment Will Decrease Motivation and Academic\nEngagement Among K-12 Students Who Have Already Received DACA or\nWho Would Have Been Eligible to Receive DACA\nIn the pre-DACA era, undocumented young people were discouraged from excelling\nacademically because they faced substantial obstacles that foreclosed many of their post-high\nschool opportunities. For example, federal law prohibits undocumented students from receiving\nfederal financial aid, and state laws governing access to in-state tuition and state financial aid\nvary wildly.s Forced to work at low-paying jobs, and ineligible for much of the financial aid and\nscholarship money available to their peers, undocumented college students often found it\nimpossible to afford tuition.6 These students were also barred from participating in work-study\nprogams that offset college costs and provide entry-level professional experience, and they were\nexcluded from any college major or career that required \"hands on\" training in the form of\ninternships or other progra~ns.~\nEven those undocumented students who did manage to obtain some form of higher\neducation were often relegated to \"low-end service sector work,\" such as \"light manufacturing,\nconstruction, and private businesses, such as landscaping, housekeeping, and cleaning.\"8 These\njobs, which rarely matched the education or skill level of undocumented high school graduates,\nseldom provided benefits, opportunities for advancement, or job security.9 As a result,\n5I  h ave DACA andI  e c~n Use the FAFSA?

Encouraged by the prospect of working toward real careers, high\nschool-aged DACA recipients reported \"an immediate change in their motivation.\"25 Attending\ncollege and working in their \"dream fields\" suddenly became attainable goals.26 As one young\nwoman explained, \"My freshman year and my sophomore year, I did really bad, mostly because\nI was just not motivated because ...all of this is going to be worthless in the end. But then\nwhen DACA came out, I started doing a lot better....I   was super motivated.\"27 DACA has also\nallowed these students to come out of the shadows and take full advantage of the academic\nresources many U.S.-born students take for granted.\nThe release of the Rescission Memorandum has already led to decreased motivation and\nincreased absenteeism among immigrant students. Dr. Marguerite Getting, a pediatrician whose\npractice focuses on immigrant and low-income patients,28 described treating a 17 year-old\nDACA recipient who had intended to enroll in a nursing program, but is now reconsidering her\nplan because she does not know whether she will be able to obtain a job after graduating.z~  Dr.\n24 Interview of 18 Year-Old Female DACA Recipient from Delaware, Dec. 19, 2017.\nZS Roberto G.

In areas lacking reliable\npublic transportation, this could be tremendously isolating, making daily commutes to school\ndifficult and time consuining.35 Obtaining any official form of identification, in fact, posed a\nsignificant challenge for undocumented young people in the pre-DACA era, meaning visits to\n36\nlibraries and other educational institutions could be hampered by their immigration status.\nAs their friends strengthened their resumes and started saving for college through summer\njobs and internships, undocumented young people in the pre-DACA era were frequently forced to\nperform unskilled labor for low wages.37 Furthermore, because many financial institutions require\ncustomers to provide identification documents, young people without Social Security numbers\nwere often prevented from opening bank accounts, making saving for higher education, and paying\nfor college applications far more challenging.38\nDACA's work authorization allows undocumented young people to obtain jobs and\ninternships that provide entry level work experience, build resumes, and strengthen college\napplications.39 An 18-year old DACA recipient who is currently a freshman at her \"dream\"\nuniversity described how DACA's work authorization allowed her to obtain an internship with a\ncollege preparation leadership program.

One student explained:\nWhen that whole college process started, it definitely hit me hard. It\nwas just really frustrating. I felt like I had put so much work into\nschool,  into  studying,  into  making  good  grades. I went  into\ndepression .... I started thinking I'm never going to go anywhere\nand it's all because of some paper Id on't have. It was really rough.\nsl\nI was angry all the time.\nAnother young man described feeling despondent about his future after learning that he\nwas undocumented, stating, \"College and law school were definitely in my plans. But when my\nmom told me I wasn't legal, everything turned upside down.I   didn't know what to do. Ic ouldn't\nsee my future anymore.\"52 Even middle school students experienced the psychological effects of\nbeing undocumented.  An 18-year old young man recalled feeling discouraged in middle school\nbecause he worried that his immigration status would prevent him from attending college or\nhaving a career that interested him. Receiving DACA gave hi~n renewed his hope for the future\nand inspired hiin to work harder in school. 53 Similarly, aseventh-grade boy who dreamed of\nbeing a chef told one researcher that he felt \"[a] lot of stress, a lot of sadness\" because of the\neducational and professional roadblocks he expected to encounter.54 After this boy received\nss\nDACA a few years later, his mother reported that he was acting like a \"new person.\"\nso Rachel Siemons et al., Coming of Age on the Mnrgins: Mental Health and Wellbeing Among\nLatino Immigrant Young Adults Eligible.for Deferred Action. for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), 19\nJournal of Immigrant and Minority Health, 543-544 (2016).\ns~ DACA at Year Three, supra note 25, at 8.\n52 GONZALES, supra note 6, at 102.\ns3 Interview of 18 year-old Male DACA Recipient from Delaware, Dec. 20, 2017.\n54 DREBY, supra note 16, at 104.\nss \nId at 187.\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 133   Filed 12/21/17   Page 18 of 25 PageID #: 6448\nThe Rescission Memorandum has already had a substantial detrimental impact on the\npsychological well-being of DACA recipients and children who planned to apply for DACA.\nDr. Getting described treating a 16 year-old DACA recipient who attempted suicide after the\nTrump administration announced its plans to end DACA. She consistently earned good grades\nand had been excited to apply to colleges, but she became terrified of what was going happen to\nher if DACA ended.  She told Dr. Getting that she tried to end her own life she had listened to\nher mother cry herself to sleep every night for weeks, and she \"did not know what else to do.\"s~\nDr. Julie Linton, Co-Chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Immigrant Health Special\nInterest Group, described treating a 13-year-old boy shortly after the DACA rescission was\nannounced. The boy, who planned to apply for DACA when he turned 15, tearfully described\nhis anxiety to Dr. Linton and told her that he \"had no hope for the future.\"57 Dr. Janine Young, a\npediatrician whose practice focuses on recent immigrants and refugees, described treating a 17-\nyear-old female DACA recipient experiencing severe organ failure. In need of alife-saving\nsurgery and extensive follow up care, the patient became terrified that she would lose her\nmedical coverage when she turned 18 if DACA was rescinded.  She stopped eating, and her\nalready reduced weight plummeted. She became withdrawn in school and failed many of her\nclasses.

Dr. Linton described treating a 16 year-old female DACA recipient who had\nplanned to attend college and medical school. The patient explained that she was distressed\nbecause the end of DACA meant that she would no longer be able to \"pursue her dreams.\" She\n60\nreported that she could not sleep and that she was having trouble concentrating in school.\nDACA has provided significant psychological relief to current DACA recipients, along\nwith children who planned to apply for DACA, by alleviating their daily fear of deportation and\nexpanding their future opportunities. If the Rescission Memorandum is not enjoined, these\nstudents will experience significant health problems that will impair their academic performance.\nII.  ENDING DACA WILL IRREPARABLY HARM K-12 STUDENTS WHOSE\nPARENTS ARE DACA RECIPIENTS OR WHOSE PARENTS WOULD HAVE\nBEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DACA\nA quarter of DACA recipients are parents of U.S.-born children.61 If these parents lose\ntheir work authorization, they will be worse off financially and less equipped to provide their\nU.S.-born children with critical educational resources. Moreover, if DACA recipients lose their\nprotection from deportation, their children will experience increased stress and anxiety due to\nfears that their parents will be detained or deported. Because poverty and psychological stress\nare significant causes of poor academic performance and behavioral issues in children, the\neducational prospects of U.S.-born children of DACA recipients will be irreparably harmed if the\nRescission Memorandum is not enjoined.\ns9 Jonathan Blitzer, Undocurnentecl I~ninigrants Brace for the Trump Administration, The New\nYorker (Dec. 19, 2016).\nbo \nInterview of Dr. Julie Linton, Oct. 31, 2017.\n61 Samantha Michaels, 1 in 4 Dreamers are Parents of US Citizens, Mother Jones (Sept. 7,\n2017).\n14\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 133   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 25 PageID #: 6450\nA.  If the Rescission Memorandum is Not Enjoined, Adult DACA Recipients\nWill Have Greater Difficulty Providing for Their U.S.-Born Children,\nLeading to Poorer Academic Performance\nNo longer relegated to low wage, unskilled labor, DACA recipients have significantly\nincreased their earnings since the policy was enacted, and many have obtained jobs that provide\nbenefits such as health insurance and paid leave.62 If they lose their work authorization, these\nindividuals will once again be consigned to low paying jobs that require them to work long hours\naway from their children.63 As a result, these parents will be less capable of providing their\nchildren with critical resources that accelerate learning, such as educational toys and books, pre-\nkindergarten programs, technology, and tutors. Furthermore, being undocumented exacerbates\nthe \"economic stressors associated with parenting.'.'64 One-third of children born to\nundocumented parents live in poverty, compared with 18 percent of children with U.S. citizen\nparents,65 and the average income for families with at least one undocumented parent in 2007\nbb\nwas about 40%lower than that of U.S. citizen families.\nLiving in poverty puts children at a severe academic disadvantage. One study found that\nchildren who live in impoverished communities are four times more likely than their peers to be\nchronically absent from school.b~  As discussed above in Section II.A, erratic attendance is\ndirectly linked to poor academic performance.

Many are\nbilingual, allowing them to effectively communicate with both U.S.-born and immigrant\nstudents. See Dkt. 55-11 (17-CV-5228) (Decl. of Viridiana Carrizales) at ¶ 11. Moreover,\nDACA-recipient teachers \"serve as role models and navigators for students who face the\nintersecting challenges of poverty and undocumented status.\" Id. While all children benefit\nwhen schools employ teachers from diverse backgrounds, children of color consistently perform\nbetter when taught by teachers of color, leading to \"better attendance, fewer suspensions and\nhigher test scores.\"87 One DACA-recipient teacher in New Mexico explained his approach to\nteaching:\nI work to inspire my students to see themselves as agents of change,\nand to be proud of who they are.

They have lived most of their lives in the United States, typically with no memory of\nany other home. Only young people who have pursued education or served in our military, and\nhave no significant criminal record, are eligible for DACA status. Yet theynow face deportation\ntooftendangerous andunfamiliarplaces, oralife intheundocumentedshadows.\nAmici believe, on the basis of faith and morality, that these children and young adults\nmust be protected. Amici therefore offer this brief in support of the plaintiffs’ motions for\npreliminary injunctions in order to address how, in their view, the Government’s proposed\ntermination of DACA (the “Termination Memo”) would cause irreparable harm and constitute a\nsevere detriment to the public. Amici have firsthand knowledge of the valuable contributions to\nfaith and community made by DACA recipients and understand all too well the harm that the\ntermination of DACA would cause. For example, endingDACA would put Nancy, an Associate\nPastor at amicus St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in Long Beach, California, who came to the\nUnited States from Mexico at age seven, at risk of deportation. Amici detail the stories of Nancy\nand others like her in Section II(A) below to provide the Court with a sample of the lives that are\nat risk of being upended. Amici also know, because of their religious and charitable work in\nLatin America and other regions, the challenges and dangers these young people face if they are\ndeported.\nAmici also have a direct stake in these issues beyond their religious concerns and the\nprotection of their congregants. First, amici stand to lose the substantial benefits they currently\n4\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 10 of 26 PageID #: 6867\nenjoy as a result of the varied contributions that DACA recipients make to their congregations\nandinstitutions.\nSecond, if the Termination Memo is carried out and DACA recipients and DACA-\neligible individuals are forced into hiding, amici will suffer an impairment of their ability to\ncarry out their core mission to provide spiritual guidance and general assistance to people of all\nbackgrounds and faiths.\nThird, many amici have and will continue to offer sanctuary to those facing deportation.\nAmici’s churches, mosques, and synagogues are ostensibly designated by U.S. Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) as sensitive locations to be avoided by enforcement officials, but\nICE has shown a growing willingness to target and exploit, rather than avoid, sensitive locations.\nAmici will be on the front line of this conflict if DACA is rescinded: honoring their convictions\ntoprotect DACArecipients will risk ICEraids on oraroundtheirhouses ofworship.\nFor the reasons set forth herein and in Plaintiffs’ and other amici’s briefs, amici urge the\nCourt to grant the preliminary injunctions restraining the Termination Memo in its entirety,\nrather than allowing any aspect of the Termination Memo to go into effect. This is the\nappropriate remedy pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, as described in Section III\nbelow,andis necessarytoprevent irreparableharm.\nARGUMENT\nPlaintiffs have filed motions asking the Court to enter a preliminary injunction\nsuspending the Government’s planned termination of DACA. (See Dkt. 123 in Case No. 16-cv-\n4756 and Dkt. 96 inCase No. 17-cv-5228). As set forth therein, to succeed on their applications,\nPlaintiffs must show, inter alia, that the Government’s proposed actions would cause irreparable\nharm and constitute a severe detriment to the public. See, e.g., Pretty Girl, Inc. v. Pretty Girl\nFashions, Inc., 778 F. Supp. 2d 261, 264-65 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (Garaufis, J.). Amici endorse the\n5\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 11 of 26 PageID #: 6868\narguments set forth by Plaintiffs, and submit this brief to further illustrate the irreparable harm\nthat implementation of the Termination Memo would cause, and to set forth the parameters of\ntheappropriatereliefthis Court shouldgrant.\nI. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORT DACAAS AJUST\nRESPONSE TO AHUMANITARIANCRISIS\nAmici object to the Government’s arbitraryand ill-reasoned decision to rescind DACA on\nmoral, spiritual, and religious grounds. Although they represent different faiths and\ndenominations, amici are in unequivocal agreement that DACA is a force for good in our society\nthat should be protected. As amicus Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York explains,\n“DACA is an important first step to acknowledging and growing the human and social\ncontributions and needs of young immigrants and of our own communities.”1 Those who are\neligible for DACA or who already benefit from it “were brought to the United States” by their\nparents, “now have established roots, have built families, have contributed to their communities\nof faith, work, and family,” and their “energy, spirit, life, and heart are part of this nation, which\ncanonlybenefit from theircontinuedparticipation.”\nFor many amici, these convictions are deeply rooted in their faith and moral principles.\nTemple Sinai of Washington D.C., for example, believes that “as a Jewish institution, Biblical\ntexts and our Jewish history inform our position on modern day immigration policy. Leviticus\n19 explicitly says, ‘When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall do him no\nwrong.’” St. Luke’s Cathedral in Long Beach, California, similarly states that “for us, this is a\nbiblical rather than a political issue.” And as the Catholic mission Maryknoll attests,\n“recognizing the hardships and struggles of immigrant families, and the tremendous economic\n1 Quotes from amici or individual congregants herein are drawn from interviews conducted by counsel to provide\ntheCourtwithafullerunderstandingofhowDACAhasimpactedAmericanreligiouscommunities.\n6\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 12 of 26 PageID #: 6869\nand social contributions Dreamers make to the United States, we feel it is unethical to send\nDreamers backto countries theyhardlyknow, as well as asenseless loss toournation.”\nFor others still, supporting DACA is part of their social justice mission. Christ Church\nCathedral in Cincinnati has, in light of the Government’s immigration policy priorities, “focused\nits social justice concerns on matters of immigration and the impact that deportations or the\nrepeal ofDACAwill haveonGod’s children.”\nAmici and groups like them have, accordingly, objected vocally to the arbitrary repeal of\nthe DACA program. On September 5, 2017, when the Government announced its decision to\nterminate DACA, countless religious groups and leaders released statements of condemnation.\nThe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops publicly called the decision “reprehensible,”\n“unacceptable,” and “a heartbreaking moment in our history that shows the absence of mercy\nand good will.”2 The Council on American-Islamic Relations described the move as a “heartless\naction [that] will onlyserve to create fear and anxietyfor the Dreamers and their loved ones, and\nwill forcethem back tolivingintheshadows, renderingthem unable tocontributetoournation’s\neconomy.”3 And amici Union for Reform Judaism and Central Conference of American Rabbis\ndeclared it “morally misguided and poor public policy,” noting that “Judaism demands that we\nwelcomethestranger andcompels us toworkfor ajust immigrationsystem.”4\n2UnitedStatesConferenceofCatholicBishops,USCCBPresident,VicePresidentandCommitteeChairmen\nDenounceAdministration’sDecisiontoEndDACAandStronglyUrgeCongresstoFindLegislativeSolution,\nhttp://www.usccb.org/news/2017/17-157.cfm(Sept.5,2017).\n3CouncilonAmerican-IslamicRelations,CAIRCondemnsTrump’sTerminationofDACAProgramas‘Pandering\ntoAnti-ImmigrantExtremists’,https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14582-cair-condemns-trump-s-\ntermination-of-daca-program-as-pandering-to-anti-immigrant-extremists.html(Sept.5,2017).\n4ReligiousActionCenterofReformJudaism,ReformJewishMovementAssailsWhiteHouseTargetingof\nImmigrantYouth,https://rac.org/reform-jewish-movement-assails-white-house-targeting-immigrant-youth(Sept.5,\n2017).\n7\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 26 PageID #: 6870\nAmici agree wholeheartedly with these statements. Rev. Robin Hynicka of amicus Arch\nStreet United Methodist Church (“UMC”) in Philadelphia, for example, describes the\n“mythologysurroundingwhypeoplemigrate”as a campaignto“criminalizeimmigration” andto\npaint all immigrants as “bad,” when in fact the “the real reasons for these migrations are not\nlistened to, considered, or understood.” He explains: “From a faith perspective, we take a\nbaptismal vow that states we will resist evil, injustice, and oppression in any form in which it\npresents itself. The current immigration system and the move to end DACA create unjust\ncircumstances, made manifest in human suffering. The attempt to crack down on Dreamers is a\nserious, cynical, evil action that has nothing to do with safety or justice. We have a theological\nandmoral obligationtoopposetheseforces.”\nAmici include entities that have taken active steps to protect Dreamers. A nation-wide,\ninterfaith network of communities and congregations known as the New Sanctuary Movement,\nof which many amici are a part, have pledged to stand in solidarity with immigrants facing\ndeportation.5 These groups provide preparedness training and legal counseling and referrals;\naccompany individuals to immigration hearings; run awareness programs and panel discussions;\nand conduct advocacy aimed at supporting immigrant communities through the lens of faith.\nAmicus New Mexico Faith Coalition for Immigrant Justice, for example, provides these services\n“inorderto createbetter immigrationlaws and a morejust system that supports thewell-beingof\nall,” and employs two DACA recipients in their three-person office. Similarly, amicus New\nSanctuary Movement of Philadelphia is a network of diverse ministries that participate in\ntrainings, workshops, campaigns and events, and accompany families facing deportation. They\nbelieve that the Government’s actions “violate the fundamental teachings of the Judeo-Christian\ntraditions—to welcome the stranger and love your neighbor as yourself.” And amicus New\n5SeeSanctuaryMovement,http://www.sanctuarynotdeportation.org/.\n8\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 14 of 26 PageID #: 6871\nSanctuary Coalition of NYC is an interfaith network working “to reform immigration\nenforcement practices and policies, both locally and nationally, with a special focus on\npreserving family unity.” As explained below, many amici and congregations like them have\noffered themselves as places of sanctuary, providing shelter to those targeted for deportation\nactions.\nAmici thus oppose with deep conviction the Government’s arbitrarydecision to terminate\nDACA. As institutions of faith with a special interest in servicing vulnerable immigrant\npopulations, amici have direct knowledge of the harm that the Government’s actions will cause\ntothem andthepeoplewithwhom theylive,work,andworship.\nII. TERMINATIONOFDACAWILL CAUSE AMICI,THEIR\nCONGREGATIONS,ANDTHEIRCOMMUNITIES IRREPARABLE\nHARMAND POSES AGRAVE THREAT TO PUBLICWELFARE\nThe early and arbitrary termination of DACA will not only imperil Plaintiffs, it will\ndirectly harm amici and their congregants, clergy members, staff, clients, and communities.6 In\nthe words of amicus Church Council of Greater Seattle, “DACA-recipients are our brothers and\nsisters, relatives, service-providers, congregational members, initiators of small business, and\nprotectors of our communities and nation,” and the Government’s actions would “deprive\nhopeful and patriotic men and women of the opportunity to exercise their hopes and dreams, to\nthe detriment of the common good.” Like our society at large, faith communities, according to\nthe Albuquerque Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), “stand to lose\n6Ordinarily,apartyseekingapreliminaryinjunctionmustshowthatit—notathirdparty—willdirectlysufferharm\nifthe injunctionisnot granted.

First, DACA\nrecipients are vital members of amici’s congregations and workforces whose loss of status will\nnot only disrupt their lives, but harm amici who benefit from their participation. Second,\ntermination of the DACA program will impair the abilityof amici and other religiously-affiliated\norganizations to carry out their missions to help people of all backgrounds and faiths. Third, as\ninstitutions of faith and sensitive locations for immigration enforcement purposes, many amici\nface the grim prospect that following their spiritual calling to provide sanctuary for targeted\nDreamers will result in the religious entities themselves being targeted by immigration\nenforcement authorities, a concern that would increase dramatically with the termination of\nDACA.\nA.

Like many Dreamers, Nancy\ndid not know she was undocumented until her junior year of high school, when she applied to\ncollege and learned what a social security number was—and that she did not have one.

The Episcopal Church served as an\nextended familyduring her childhood, and bythe time she turned 17 Nancy led the largest youth\ngroup in the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. So great was her dedication that the Church\npaid for her tuition to college and seminary school, where she obtained a Master’s of Divinity\ndegree. After obtaining DACA status, Nancy was able to fulfill her dream of becoming an\nordained Episcopal minister. Today, Nancy is the associate rector at amicus St. Luke’s\nEpiscopal Church, and the Diocese of Los Angeles’s first Latina leader to have grown up in a\nSpanish-speaking Episcopal Church and gone on to pursue ordination. At St. Luke’s, she is\nactivelyinvolvedinimmigrants’ rights activism andeducationinitiatives.\nFor Nancy, the Government’s announcement on September 5, 2017 was “a moment of\ncomplete fear and hopelessness.” She and others like her have “made a life here, trusted the\nsystem and tried to do things the right way,” but now “run the risk that we will be hunted down\nandsent toacountrythat wedonot know.”\nRafael. Brought to Los Angeles at three years old, Rafael, an office assistant with\namicus New Mexico Faith Coalition for Immigrant Justice, was born in Guanajuato, Mexico.\nRafael’s parents, having risked everything to bring him to the United States, sought to instill in\nhim the values of hard work and education. They succeeded. Rafael completed a Bachelor’s\nDegree with a double major in History and Chicano Studies from California State University\nDominguez Hills while working full time to pay his tuition and support himself. After obtaining\nDACA status, Rafael went on to obtain a Master’s Degree in American Studies at the University\nofNewMexico,whereheis nowaPh.D.candidateandaninstructor.\n11\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 26 PageID #: 6874\nRafael’s parents also instilled in him the values of Catholicism. He believes that faith-\nbased organizations “fill the gaps of social justice and service that many times nation-states do\nnot offer.” As such, he works for amicus New Mexico Faith Coalition for Immigrant Justice as\nan office assistant. Rafael is proud to contribute to their work, which he sees as fulfilling\ncommunityneeds andanatural expressionofhis Catholicfaith.\nFor Rafael, the end of DACA represents drastic and dangerous change. It spells the end\nof access to the work that he loves and a halt to his career after graduation. Moreover, it means\n“going back to living in the reality of survival mode,” forever uncertain of his place and\npermanenceinhis ownhome,andwithout opportunitytoflourish and grow.\nAndrea. Andrea is a legal assistant at amicus American Friends Service Committee.\nAndrea was born and baptized in Ecuador, but brought to New Jersey by her parents when she\nwas a year and a half old. Andrea grew up in the Catholic Church. She went to Sunday school,\ntook First Communion, and received Confirmation at her church in the Newark area, where she\ncontinues tovolunteerin youth groups and forfundraisingactivities.\nAndrea’s parents, like many parents of Dreamers, prioritized her education. Knowing\nshe could not obtain financial aid, Andrea’s parents, both union members, carefullysaved. After\nAndrea earned a paralegal degree from community college, her parents put her through Rutgers\nUniversity’s undergraduate program. Nonetheless, until DACA, Andrea’s life was one of fear\nandconstraint.

After she obtained DACA status, she\nwas hired as a paralegal at a law firm, and was proud to have a job and a salary. Andrea’s dream\nis to go to law school in the United States. For her, the end of DACA puts her dream to a halt\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 26 PageID #: 6875\nand threatens to send her to Ecuador, a place she has never set foot since she was an infant. In\nthe face of this peril, Andrea maintains, “I love this country and I can’t imagine living\nelsewhere.”\n* * *\nThe harm that these individuals would suffer as a result of their loss of DACA status is\nreadilyapparent. See Nunez v. Boldin, 537 F. Supp. 578, 587 (S.D. Tex. 1982) (“Deportation to a\ncountry where one’s life would be threatened obviously would result in irreparable injury.”);\nKalaw v. Ferro, 651 F. Supp. 1163, 1167 (W.D.N.Y. 1987) (enjoining deportation proceeding\nand finding irreparable harm because “petitioner’s deportation would make her ineligible for any\nsubsequent application for legalization”). Amici would be harmed as well; not only do people\nlike Nancy, Rafael and Andrea contribute richly to religious and faith-based organizations\nthrough their own individual efforts, they serve as mentors and inspire others to give back to\ninstitutions from which they have benefitted. If the Termination Memo goes into effect, nearly\n800,000 Dreamers—many with stories similar to the three detailed above—will be forced out of\nthe country or into hiding. Amici will suffer incalculable harm if they are deprived of the\ncontributions andtalents ofthese youngcongregants andcommunitymembers.\nMoreover, as amici know from their work in other parts of the world, Dreamers deported\nwould face tremendous challenges and even physical danger. For example, Gerry Lee and\nothers from amicus Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns have lived and worked with\nimpoverished families in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries to which DACA\nrecipients face deportation. In Haiti, for example, “Maryknoll Sisters have witnessed the bare\nstruggle for post-disaster survival in the massive slums of Cite Soleil, where they help residents\nsubsist from gardens grown in discarded tires on turf fought over by rival gangs.” In El\n13\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 26 PageID #: 6876\nSalvador, a Maryknoll Lay Missioner witnessed “the anger and pain that pervades communities\npreyed upon by powerful gangs, where immediate survival forces youth to face grim choices\nbetween lives of drugs and guns—or escape.” In Guatemala, a Maryknoll Father reports on the\n“rising rates of femicide” and sums up what motivates millions of rural migrants in a single\nword: “desperation.” And along the U.S.-Mexico border, Maryknoll Missioners hear daily the\n“stories of desperation from the countries to which many Dreamers might be returned,” namely,\nthat “poverty, starvation, extortion, sexual assault, gang violence, and political oppression are\namong the conditions cited as triggers to leave.” In one such encounter in Nogales, Sonora, “a\nman travellingnorth with his son from Honduras merelypointed south and said, “There is no life\nthere anymore.” Children raised in America knowing no other country should not have to face\ndeportationintosuchconditions.\nB. Impairmentof Amici’s AbilityToCarryOutTheirMissions\nIt goes without saying that religious and faith-affiliated organizations such as amici play\na vital role in society. Countless lives have been uplifted and enriched by the spiritual guidance\nas well as the material and legal assistance these institutions provide. Immigrants and their\nfamilies—including children brought to this country at a young age—are among the groups that\nhave benefitted most from the support furnished by amici and similar organizations. By aiding\nsuch vulnerable individuals, faith-based organizations including amici have helped to make their\nentirecommunities more prosperous, unitedand civicallyengagedthantheyotherwisewouldbe.\nImplementation of the Termination Memo would undermine these efforts by making it\nvirtually impossible for amici to continue their outreach to Dreamers and their families, causing\namici irreparable harm. See Step by Step, Inc. v. City of Ogdensburg, 176 F. Supp. 3d 112, 135\n(N.D.N.Y. 2016) (finding irreparable harm to not-for-profit provider of mental health support\nservices because defendant city’s denial of zoning approval of housing for the mentally ill\n14\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 26 PageID #: 6877\ndeprived plaintiff of its abilityto pursue its mission); First Step, Inc. v. City of New London, 247\nF. Supp. 2d 135, 156-57 (D. Conn. 2003) (finding irreparable harm to not-for-profit group\ndedicated to assisting individuals with disabilities because “[b]y hindering First Step’s attempts\nto relocate to a building that is handicapped accessible and that would better accommodate the\nprograms First Step sought to offer, the defendants are preventing First Step from serving some\nclients anddiminishingthequalityand varietyof First Step’s programs, underminingFirst Step’s\npurpose of ‘educating and assisting individuals with disabilities to achieve independence and\nintegrateintothelargercommunity,’thus denyingit “theabilitytopursueits mission”).\nAmici cannot reach people in need if those people are hiding in the shadows or have been\ndeported. If the Termination Memo is implemented, amici and similarly-situated organizations\nwill losetheirabilitycarryout theircore missiontoassist thoseinthe greatest need ofhelp. This\nwill result in the needless suffering not only of at-risk individuals, but of their communities as a\nwhole.\nC. As Sensitive Locations for Immigration Enforcement Purposes, Some\nAmici Will be Called Upon to Provide Sanctuary While at the Same Time\nRiskingBeingTargeted forImmigration Raids\nFinally, religiously-affiliated organizations like amici occupya unique position in matters\nof immigration enforcement, particularly with respect to DACA. Pursuant to an October 2011\nmemorandum by then-ICE Director John Morton, ICE is not to engage in immigration\nenforcement actions such as arrests, interviews, searches, or surveillance at churches,\nsynagogues, mosques, or other houses of worship, unless exigent circumstances or other law\nenforcement purposes exist, or if prior approval is obtained (the “ICE sensitive locations\npolicy”).8 In 2016, while the prior administration was still in office, then-Secretaryof Homeland\n8MemorandumfromJohnMorton,Director,U.S.ImmigrationandCustomsEnforcementtoFieldOfficeDirectors,\nSpecialAgentsinCharge,andChiefCounsel(Oct.24,2011),https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ero-outreach/pdf/10029.2-\n15\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 26 PageID #: 6878\nSecurity Jeh C. Johnson publicly reiterated that “when enforcing the immigration laws, our\npersonnel will not, except in emergency circumstances, apprehend an individual at a place of\nworship, a school, a hospital or doctor’s office or other sensitive location.”9 The ICE sensitive\nlocations policyremains ineffect today,at least as anofficial matter.10\nThe ICE sensitive locations policyrecognizes that houses of worship are sacred spaces of\nsanctuary and peace, where community members can go and be without fear of harassment or\narrest. Many amici and others like them proudly fulfill that role and have pledged to offer their\nchurches, synagogues, and mosques as sanctuaries to those at risk of deportation. Temple Sinai\nDC, Christ Church Cathedral in Cincinnati, St. Luke’s in Long Beach, Arch Street UMC in\nPhiladelphia, Albuquerque Friends Meeting, the many members of amici New Sanctuary\nMovement of Philadelphia, New Mexico Faith Coalition for Immigrant Justice, and New\nSanctuary NYC, and others have publicly declared their status as sanctuary congregations.\nThese organizations maintain dedicated, furnished space for visitors who need protection, and\nrelyontheircongregants forsupport indoingso.\nIn each case, the decision to become a sanctuary congregation is made after careful\ndiscussion among congregations and communities, and reflects broad religious consensus on this\nissue. The Albuquerque Friends Meeting,for example,when called upontorespond toan urgent\nneed for sanctuarybya communitymember, convened their members and attenders. “Through a\nprocess of deep discernment together—and in commitment to our Quaker values of Equality and\nCommunity—we were led to a profound sense of Spiritual Unity, meaning we were ‘One in the\npolicy.pdf.

Many amici reported\nthat these decisions, while weighty, were not difficult to make. When Arch Street UMC was\ncalled upon to house a man in danger of immigration detention, “the conversation among the\ncongregation wasn’t ‘will we do this,’ but how?” They provided sanctuary to the man in\nquestionfor11months.\nUnder the current administration, however, the parameters and application of the ICE\nsensitivelocations policyis increasinglyindoubt. ICEhas alreadybeguntotarget areas adjacent\nto places of worship for enforcement actions, to worrisome effect. For example, earlier this year\non a freezing cold morning in Alexandria, Virginia, a dozen ICE agents surrounded a group of\nLatino men as they emerged from a church hypothermia shelter where they had spent the night.\nSix men were arrested and taken away in vans.11 After church leaders demanded and were\nrefused the names and locations of the men taken, Governor Terry McAuliffe and Senator Tim\nKaine both sent letters to ICE inquiring about the raid and their enforcement policies near\nchurches. ICE responded to neither.12 In suburban Illinois, ICE agents tricked a worshiper into\nleaving a church service—by texting him from his cousin’s cell phone about a fictional car\naccident—and arrested him at a neighboring McDonald’s. They arrived in unmarked cars and\nwore vests that said “Police.” A retired ICE supervisor, interviewed after-the-fact, praised this\nstrategyas “actually... quitecreative.”13\n11JulieCarey,NBCWashington,ICEAgentsArrestMenLeavingFairfaxCountyChurchShelter,\nhttps://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/ICE-Agents-Arrest-Men-Leaving-Alexandria-Church-Shelter-\n413889013.html(Feb.15,2017).\n12AlexEmmons,TheIntercept,TargetingaSanctuary:AfterICEStakesOutaChurchHomelessShelter,Charities\nWorryImmigrantsWillFearGettingHelp,https://theintercept.com/2017/02/27/after-ice-stakes-out-a-church-\nhomeless-shelter-charities-worry-immigrants-will-fear-getting-help/(Feb.27,2017).\n13OdetteYousef,WBEZ95.1Chicago,AmidDeportationPush,SuburbanChurchGrappleswithLoss,\nhttps://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/amid-deportation-push-suburban-church-grapples-with-loss/3d269fc3-\n04e7-4604-bae4-a376a37410c9(Feb.15,2016).\n17\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 23 of 26 PageID #: 6880\nICE has shown a propensity to target sensitive or controversial locations other than\nreligious institutions as well. In Charlotte, North Carolina, ICE conducted raids and arrests\nwithin two miles of a predominantly Latino elementary school.14 Students witnessed the arrests\nas they passed by in school busses.15 In El Paso, Texas, a Latina woman was taken into custody\nby ICE agents dressed in plain clothes after she left a courtroom in a county courthouse. The\ncriminal complaint filed against her indicates that ICE knew she was living at a domestic and\nsexual abuseresourcecenter.16\nThese incidents indicate that instead of abiding by the spirit of the sensitive locations\nmemorandum—that is, to avoid immigration enforcement at sensitive locations—ICE is using\nhouses of worship and other locations as lures for easy, unsuspected surveillance and arrest.\nThis puts amici in the untenable and unacceptable position of at once heeding their faith-based\ncalling to provide sanctuary while at the same time attracting the attention of those who would\ndo harm to the people amici seek to protect. This crisis of conscience has sewn fear and anxiety\namong amici and their congregants and supporters. These concerns will be greatly exacerbated\niftheTerminationMemo goes intoeffect andthe DACAprogram is terminated.\n14TinaVasquez,Rewire,HaveTrump’sMassDeportationsBegun?ImmigrationArrestsReportedAroundthe\nCountry,https://rewire.news/article/2017/02/10/trumps-mass-deportations-begin-immigration-arrests-reported-\naround-country/(Feb.10,2017).\n15QuéPasaMiGente,ArrestosdeICEcercadeescuelaelementaldemayoríahispana,\nhttps://charlotte.quepasanoticias.com/noticias/ciudad/local/arrestos-de-ice-cerca-de-escuela-elemental-de-mayoria-\nhispana(Feb.9,2017),translationavailableat\nhttps://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcharlotte.quepasanoticias.com%2F\nnoticias%2Fciudad%2Flocal%2Farrestos-de-ice-cerca-de-escuela-elemental-de-mayoria-hispana.\n16ABC-7KVIA,Whichplacesareconsidered‘sensitivelocations’?,http://www.kvia.com/crime/which-places-are-\nconsidered-sensitive-locations/338319025(Feb.16,2017).\n18\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 24 of 26 PageID #: 6881\nIII. THIS COURT SHOULD ENJOIN THE TERMINATION MEMO IN\nFULL AND NATIONWIDE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE\nPROCEDURES ACT\nAs illustrated by the stories detailed in the preceding sections, the Termination Memo\nwill cause irreparable harm to individuals from all walks of life and across the entire United\nStates. The Termination Memo will affect nearly 800,000 DACA grantees along with their\nfamily members, communities, and faith groups. In order to address fully the scope of the harm\nthe Termination Memo has inflicted and will continue to cause, this Court should enjoin\nimplementationoftheMemonationwideandinits entirety.\nContrary to the Government’s assertion, injunctive relief should not be limited to\n“particular individual Plaintiffs found to have cognizable claims.”17 The “systemwide impact”\nthe Termination Memo will have warrants a “systemwide remedy.” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S.\n343, 359 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a court determines that an executive\naction facially violates statutory constraints, a comprehensive injunction that sets aside the entire\naction is the “ordinaryresult.” Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399,\n1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (the “result is that [the action is] vacated—not that [its] application to the\nindividual petitioners is proscribed”) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is especially\nappropriate where, as here, Plaintiffs challenge not onlythe application of an action “in an illegal\nmanner on a particular occasion” but instead generally challenge the validity of a policy “of\nbroad applicability.” Id. (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n., 497 U.S. 871, 913 (1990)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting on other grounds)). Any other outcome would lead to the unjust result\nofhaltingtheTerminationMemo’s effects foronlya fractionofpersons impactedbyit.\n17 Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, (Case No. 16-cv-4756 Dkt. 95-1;\nCaseNo.No.17-cv-5228Dkt.71-1),at40.\n19\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 26 PageID #: 6882\nIn fact, a limited injunction of this nature would “merely . . . generate a flood of\nduplicative litigation.” Id.; see also Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir.\n1989) (“When a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary\nresult is that the rules are vacated—not that their application to the individual petitioners is\nproscribed.”). The Termination Memo is precisely the type of agency action of “broad\napplicability” that should be enjoined in total, not least in order to avoid unnecessary and\nrepetitive litigation and promote judicial economy. See National Mining Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409\n(refusal to sustain broad injunction where adversely impacted individuals can each challenge the\nagency action “is likely merely to generate a flood of duplicative litigation”). In the Batalla\nVidal case, a broad injunction would also eliminate the need to certify a class in order to grant\ncomprehensive relief. See Immigration Assistance Project of Los Angeles Cty Fed’n of Labor\n(AFL-CIO) v. INS, 717 F. Supp. 1444, 1447 (W.D. Wash. 1989), aff'd in part and rev’d in part,\n976 F.2d 1198 (9th Cir. 1992). Byenjoiningthe implementation of the Termination Memo in its\nentirety, this Court would ensure, in the most efficient manner possible, that all who are harmed\nbythis unlawful Government actionare abletoobtaintherelieftheydeserve.\nAccordingly, this Court should find that the Termination Memo is unlawful on its face\nand enjoin implementation of the Memo in full, not merely in its application to particular\npetitioners representedin this litigation.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, amici respectfully urge the Court to grant plaintiffs’ motions\nforpreliminaryinjunctions.\nDated: December22,2017\nNewYork, NewYork\n20\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170   Filed 12/22/17   Page 26 of 26 PageID #: 6883\nRespectfullysubmitted,\nPATTERSONBELKNAP WEBB&TYLER LLP\nBy: /s/ StevenA.Zalesin\nStevenA.

The decision to end DACA would impact individuals and families who reside in our\nparishes and broader communities. Ending residency for those currently protected by the\nDREAM Act would move our countryfurther awayfrom the principles of justice that we seek as\npeople of faith. We are committed, as people of faith, to working together with other responsible\nleaders to justly address the immediate needs of the people affected by this action and ensure\nlong-term solutions for communities impacted by exclusionary policies.

The curriculum that our community partners deliver to students\nintegrates Christian perspectives and teaching on leadership, diversity and community\ndevelopment. The Executive Order to end DACA has led more than 60 of our scholars and\nalumni to question their worth and their safety in this country. Deportation has ripped apart\nseveral of our scholars’ families. Our college partners are struggling to provide financial aid to\nthese scholars, and several scholars have dropped out of college because they can no longer\nafford it.

We seek to be Christ’s presence of mercy,\ncompassion, and hope in the communities we serve. The decision to end DACA would impact\nindividuals and families who reside in our parishes and broader communities.

Rev. Andrew M.L. Dietsche, who is our chief pastor. To Episcopalians\nit seems pretty clear what Christians are supposed to do. Jesus said “Thou shalt love the Lord\nthyGod with all thyheart, and with all thysoul, and with all thymind. This is the first and great\ncommandment.“Andthe secondis likeuntoit,Thoushalt lovethyneighboras thyself. Onthese\ntwo commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” The first thing, then, after love of\nGod—indeed the only thing— is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Not just some of them; not\njust theones wefeel comfortable with; not just theones who have thesame colored skinas us, or\nthe same sexual preferences, or who don’t smell; but every single one of them. In fact as\nEpiscopalians, we believe that no Christian life can be complete if the person living it does obey\nthis commandandact on it.\nTo end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals would endanger the lives of\nthousands of youngpeople and their families and run contraryto the faith and moral traditions of\nour country. It is unfair to threaten the well-being of youngpeople who arrived in our countryas\nchildren through no choice of their own. Ending DACA without a similar replacement program\nwill force these young people to face the future in this countrywith little access to education and\nemployment, and ultimately, could very well lead to sending them to countries where they did\nnot grow up, have few support structures, may not even speak the language and may be\nvulnerabletoviolenceandpersecution.

For 200 years, the Cathedral has\nworked in the Cincinnati community to combat poverty and has been involved, since its\nfounding, in issues of social justice. The Cathedral carries out its missions through community\ngrants, educational opportunities and direct mission work. For example, the Cathedral hosts\n“community forums” to educate the public on issues of social justice and also sponsors a 200 +\nperson dinner every Tuesday for our friends who make their homes on the streets, offering not\nonly food but also social services. Because of its tradition and continuing programs, the\nCathedral is interested in helping those who face the prospect of deportation without just cause.\nThe Cathedral is keenly aware of the perils faced by those who would be subject to such\n9\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 10 of 28 PageID #: 6893\ndeportation, including the breakup of families, the impact on economic well-being and the\ndangers faced in home countries.

One of those very current social issues regards the\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program of the federal government. FAN is\ndeeply concerned about President Trump’s decision to terminate this important protection\nprogram for those who came to this country as children by their parent(s) or family member\nmany years ago. It is morally reprehensible to think that these young people who know no other\ncountrythan the USA will be deported bynext March and sooner. We all know that deportation\nmeans imprisonment, separation from family, loss of employment and income, and will put their\nlives at risk as they are forcibly displaced to another country. FAN has advocated for those in\nthis program (Dreamers) for many years at the state and congressional level to receive equal\ntuition/scholarship opportunities for college and other government benefits. The Dreamers – as\nthey are known – love this country, contribute to our economy with their skills and talents, and\nhave–andwehopewill continuetomakeournationbetter,stronger, and moreequitable.\n30.FirstChristian Church (Disciples of Christ),SantaFe, New Mexico\nFirst Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Santa Fe, is a small, friendly church\ncommunity in the heart of Santa Fe.

We are\npassionate about being ecumenical, affirming, forgiving, cooperating, and allowing the freedom\nfor each person to develop their own understanding and relationship with God. Our vision is to\nbe a faithful, growing church that demonstrates true community, deep Christian spiritualityand a\npassion for justice. (Micah 6:8). The Disciples of Christ movement nationally and\ninternationally seeks to be a \"movement for wholeness in a fragmented world.\" As we strive to\nlive into our mission and vision for wholeness and welcome in a fragmented world, the\ntermination of the DACA program challenges our ability to welcome and unite our community.\nOur community has included many immigrants over the years, including DACA beneficiaries\nwhose lives have been stabilized by receiving legal recognition. The termination of the DACA\nprogram is an impediment to our free practice of religion as a welcoming congregation seeking\nto bridge divides and create wholeness.

Additionally, our denomination has consistently and historically expressed\nsupport for the values, safety, gifts, and perspectives of immigrants of all nations, and has called\nfor the ongoing support and protection of all DACA recipients. We sign onto this Amicus Brief\nin the spirit of Leviticus 19, which calls us not tooppress immigrants but to love each immigrant\nas ourselves, and in the Spirit of Matthew 25, in which Jesus reminds his disciples that when we\nwelcomeastranger, we welcomeJesus Christ himself.\n34.FirstUnitarian Congregational Societyin Brooklyn\nAs a member congregation in the Unitarian Universalist Association, the First Unitarian\nCongregational Society in Brooklyn (First U Brooklyn) is committed to: the inherent worth and\ndignity of every person; justice, equity and compassion in human relations; and the goal of a\nworld community with peace, liberty and justice and for all. Consistent with these principles,\nFirst U Brooklyn has declared ourselves a sanctuary congregation, invoking the millennia-old\ntradition of a house of worship offering a safe space and time for individuals in need. First U\nBrooklyn specifically offers safe space and time for immigrants and refugees to examine their\noptions andmakethesoundest decisions whenfacedwithpossibledeportation.\nBut Dreamers protected by DACA should have no need for sanctuary. Our country has\nalready recognized that it is just and appropriate to allow these young men and women, who\ncame to this country at an early age and in good conscience, to make a life for themselves in the\nUnited States, just as so many of our ancestors did. Terminating DACA now would\nunconscionably disrupt and threaten their lives and those of their families and loved ones.

Dreamers only want to work, go to school, and be family in a secure\ncommunity. They want to worship in safety. They want their children to get an education. They\nwant to be good neighbors. As an organization, we believe in the American Dream and we\nbelieve that ensuring Dreamers can participate in our communities not only helps them but helps\nthecommunities inwhichtheylive.\n39.IowaConferenceof theUnited Church of Christ\nThe Iowa Conference of the United Church of Christ is a regional association of 168\nUCC congregations.

Our rationale for this support is theological and practical: Hospitality and welcome\nfor neighbors – both long-time and newlyarrived – is fundamental to our values and our identity.\nOur congregations were mostly formed 140 to 175 years ago – many by immigrants. We are\nconvinced that the fabric of our communities is stronger today for the inclusion of those who\ncame here as “outsiders” over a century ago; similarly we believe that our communities will be\nstrengthened by the inclusion of immigrants newly in our midst, and are consequently strongly\nsupportiveofDACA.\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 28 PageID #: 6896\n40.IslamicSocietyof BaskingRidge\nThe Islamic Society of Basking Ridge is dedicated to providing Islamic religious,\neducational, cultural and social services to Muslims living or working in Somerset Hills, New\nJersey, and the surrounding areas; providing these services in an open, diverse, inclusive and\nmoderate environment, consistent with the Qur’an and Sunnah; and promoting interfaith and\nintra-faith dialogue in order to improve relations between Muslims and people of other faiths.\nWe strongly believe as part of our religious outreach that our laws must be applied fairly and\njustly to all communities.

LSSNY began in 1886 when 11 Lutheran\ncongregations in the New York metropolitan area created an orphanage for children affected bya\nsevere outbreak of influenza within the German communities of New York City. The agency\nwas among a group of Lutheran mission societies that served Lutherans who had immigrated to\nNew York. Over the years, LSSNY formed alliances with other Lutheran organizations and\nchurch bodies, and in the years since 1990 has expanded its programming to include community\nservices (immigration legal, refugee services, hunger prevention), supportive housing for\nformerly homeless individuals, and education services. Throughout this expansion, LSSNY’s\nmission has remained the same: “Called by God, we encourage people to reach their full\npotential.” LSSNY works with local community partners to understand the needs of our\nneighbors, and to bridge the gap between what any one individual can accomplish on their own,\nand what they can achieve with the supportive care of our services. LSSNY employs some 650\nemployees who work as counselors, teachers, caregivers and legal counsel, to strengthen the\nlives ofthoseweserve.\n45.Maryknoll OfficeforGlobal Concerns\nMaryknoll Office for Global Concerns is the justice and peace advocacy office\nrepresenting Maryknoll Missioners – Catholic priests, brothers, sisters and lay missioners- who\nwork with the poor and marginalized in 40 countries around the world. From their headquarters\nin Ossining, NY, Maryknoll Missioners have lived and worked with families in extreme poverty\nfor many years in countries where DACA recipients originate. Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers,\nSisters, and Lay Missioners have acquired a deep understanding of the dire social, economic and\nenvironmental conditions that Dreamers would face if they were deported, as well as intimate\n14\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 28 PageID #: 6898\nwitness to the fragility and insecurity of living in the shadows without documents in the US.\nDeporting Dreamers to their countries of origin, where most have only weak or distant ties,\nwould subject them to the same forces of poverty, violence, and instability their families\noriginally fled and from which millions more still flee. For these reasons we oppose the\ntermination of DACA and seek a resolution of Dreamers’ status that allows them a path to\ncitizenship.\n46.Metropolitan New York Synod of theEvangelical Lutheran Church inAmerica\nThe Metropolitan New York Synod is the regional expression of the Evangelical\nLutheran Church in America, a member church of the Lutheran World Federation—A\nCommunion of Churches. Lutherans are a diverse group of people, convinced that the Holy\nSpirit is leading us toward unity in the household of God. As Lutherans, we are worshipping\nGod, helping friends and neighbors, celebrating diversity, feeding the hungry, working for\njustice, and advocating for peace. When we serve others and address social issues that affect the\ncommon good, we live out our Christian faith. There are nearly 200 congregations across New\nYork City, Long Island, and in the counties of Westchester, Putnam, Orange, Rockland, Sullivan\nand Dutchess. The Rev. Dr. Robert Alan Rimbo serves as the Lutheran Bishop of the Metro\nNewYork area.\nThe Metropolitan New York Synod and, specifically, Bishop Robert Alan Rimbo, have\nbeen consistent supporters of Dreamers. The termination of the DACA program is, to say the\nleast, troubling. These people whom some now wish to deport from the only homeland they\nknow because of what can only be called the accidents of history and for no other reason – they\njust happened to be brought to our communities as their families searched for new hope – are\nmodel citizens. They are the kinds of people we want to have as neighbors: health care\nprofessionals, artists, teachers, friends, mechanics, the list seems endless, and now, for reasons\nbeyond our grasp theyare beingthreatened with deportation. We stand united against this and in\nsupport of DACA and the people it protects. We, as people of faith, are prompted to pray for\ngodly wisdom to prevail among the powers that be in our country, itself built on the hopes and\ndreams ofimmigrants.\n47.MuslimAdvocates\nMuslim Advocates is a national legal advocacy and educational organization that works\non the front lines of civil rights to guarantee freedom and justice for Americans of all faiths.\nMuslim Advocates advances these objectives through litigation and other legal advocacy, policy\nengagement, and civic education. Muslim Advocates also serves as a legal resource for the\nAmerican Muslim community, promoting the full and meaningful participation of Muslims in\nAmerican public life. The issues at stake in this case directly relate to Muslim Advocates’ work\nfighting for civil-rights protections for American Muslim communities, which includes\nimmigrants and persons who have benefited from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\nProgram.\n15\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 16 of 28 PageID #: 6899\n48.MuslimBarAssociation of New York\nMuslim Bar Association of New York (“MuBANY”) is one of the nation’s largest and\nmost active professional associations for Muslim lawyers.

We also provide charitable support in the form of\norganizing food drives and organizing relief for disaster victims. Through our work, we aim to\nassist people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds. We stress tolerance, education and humane\nsolutions to problems facing our communities. We support DACA as a just and proper response\nto a humanitarian issue that otherwise has and will continue to divide and disrupt families and\ncommunities.\n16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 28 PageID #: 6900\n52.Muslims for ProgressiveValues\nMuslims for Progressive Values is the oldest and only progressive and Muslim faith-\nbased human rights organization in the U.S. founded in 2007. We embody and advocate for the\ntraditional Quranic values of social justice, an understanding that informs our positions on\nwomen’s rights, LGBT inclusion, freedom of expression and freedom of and from belief. As an\norganization that promotes diversity and inclusivity, we find the termination of DACA cruel to\nfamilies andtheantithesis toAmerica's foundingvalues.\n53.National Council of Jewish Women\nThe National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) is a grassroots organization of 90,000\nvolunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values,\nNCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and\nfamilies and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.

Oppose intolerance and hate. Foster a climate of positive mutual acceptance\nand appreciation for all, regardless of their faith, race, or sexual orientation. Our guiding\nprinciples are to promote the adoption of the “Stand Up for the Other” pledge, especially among\nour own communities; encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration; respond to acts of\nintolerance, bigotry, terrorism, and hate; sponsor and participate in events consistent with our\nmission and promote each other’s events within our communities; and to promote other common\nactions consistent withourmission.\nOur “Stand Up for the Other” pledge leads us to support DACA and oppose its\ntermination just the same as we oppose bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia:\n“While interacting with members of my own faith, or ethnic, or gender community, or with\nothers, if Ihear hateful comments from anyone about members of anyother community, Ipledge\ntostandupfortheother andspeakuptochallengebigotryinanyform.”\n17\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 28 PageID #: 6901\n56.New MexicoConferenceof Churches\nThe New Mexico Conference of Churches is a statewide network of churches working\nfor the wellbeing of New Mexico’s peoples and environment.

Our member\ncongregations, and the communities in which they serve, include DACA recipients and their\nfamilies. Wecall forongoingsupport andprotectionofDACArecipients.\nByour baptism, we are united in Christ and called to care for the least of these (Matthew\n25:40) and to love our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:39). DACA recipients, immigrants,\nand refugees are our neighbors and we are compelled by our faith to seek and serve Christ in\neach person. We believe that justice and peace are served when the rights of all people—\nespeciallyvulnerable youngpeople,immigrants andrefugees--areprotected.\n57.New Mexico Faith Coalition forImmigrantJustice\nThe New Mexico Faith Coalition for Immigrant Justice is a faith based group that was\nformed over eight years ago as a response to attacks on our immigrant communities during the\nlast administration. Since its formation, the Coalition has been deeply committed to supporting\nthe immigrant families in New Mexico through the hardships of deportation and detention and\nhas been outspoken against unjust and inhumane immigration laws, advocating for laws that\nreflect the higher values of the dignity of the person, unity of the family, richness in diversity,\nand the freedom of the pursuit of purpose. Among the many services we provide to the\nimmigrant community are direct service: connecting families to legal and social resources, faith-\nbased community education of immigrant issues, border awareness programs, micro-loans for\nimmigration form submittals, court accompaniment for families, and refugee hospitality\nprogram: picking up and finding a place to stay for asylum seekers and asylees released from the\nCiboladetentioncenter.\nAs a small organization with 3 part-time staff, two who are DACAmented, our efforts to\nwork for immigrant justice and support the direct service needs of our migrant communities are\ninextricably tied to having a continuation of DACA or implementation of a Clean DREAM Act.\nWhilemanyofus who areallies have workedinthis fieldfor years ordecades, it is onlywith the\nparticipation and leadership of the affected communities, particularly those who are\nundocumented or under threat of immigration enforcement, that we can strive to create better\nimmigrationlaws and a morejust system that supports thewell-beingof all.\n58.New SanctuaryCoalition of New York\nTheNewSanctuaryCoalitionofNew Yorkis aninterreligious grass roots organizationin\nsolidaritywithfamilies andcommunities whoare strivingtokeeptheirlovedones together as we\nreimagine and implement ways to prevent and stop the detention and deportation of our loved\nones.\n18\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 28 PageID #: 6902\n59.New SanctuaryMovementof Philadelphia\nNew Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia (NSM) is an interfaith, multi-cultural\norganization that works to build community across faith, ethnicity and class in our work to end\ninjustices against immigrants regardless of immigration status, express radical welcome for all,\nand ensure that values of dignity, justice, and hospitality are lived out in practice and upheld in\npolicy. Working with 28 congregations, NSM has three programs: Education and Leadership\nDevelopment,Accompaniment,andGrassroots Organizing.\nNSM opposes the termination of DACA because it will have a disastrous effect on many\npeople in our member congregations and is a violation of our faith teachings. Terminating\nDACA not only impacts the 800,000 youth, but their parents and relatives. For example, we\nhave a member from Honduras who has lived in the US for 30 years. She left Honduras and her\nfamily because of the poverty in her country. She slowly brought her family here, where they\nnow have made a home. They are leaders in their church, have built families, and are all\ndedicated to improving their community. Two of her daughters have DACA, and the news of its\ntermination was a crushing blow for her. All that she has sacrificed, all the 16 hour days at a\nsewing factory were for her children to have a better life. With the termination of DACA, it\npulls awaythosedreams.\nWe work with the Latino and Indonesian community and have many DACA recipients\nwho are leaders in their congregations and their community. In the Indonesian congregations,\nDACA is important because almost all of the young adults in some of the churches are DACA\nrecipients. These recipients were brought here from Indonesia as children, many escaping anti-\nChristian persecution. They are college students, with a GPA of 3.5 or higher. They have jobs\nlike working as a bank teller, and lawyer's assistant. One of them even enlisted in the army and\nwithout DACA he wouldn't have that opportunity. Without DACA they would be stripped of\ntheir work permit and these bright minds aren't able to contribute to our society and economy.\nTheir future and ability to provide for their families would be taken away. Finally, NSM\nbelieves terminating DACA is immoral and violates the religious teachings to welcome the\nstrangerandloveourneighbor.\n60.New York Board of Rabbis\nThe New York Board of Rabbis (“NYBR”) is the largest and oldest interdenominational\nrabbinic organization in the world, representing the different streams of Jewish life in America.\nOur members serve communities in the Greater New York area and around the country.\nEstablished in 1881, the NYBR is the primary address for rabbis serving congregations,\norganizations, chaplaincies, communal service agencies, and schools. The Board seeks to\nenhance and expand the role of the Rabbinate for the betterment of the Jewish people and the\nworld at large by providing its members with a spiritual environment and opportunities to grow\nprofessionally, promoting religious pluralism, and building bridges across denominations with\nother faiths. We are a central convener of multi-faith dialogues to promote increased\nunderstandingofone anotherandpursueavenues ofcommonconcern.\nThe Jewish community is an immigrant community spanning the history of America.\nFrom the first Jewish settlers who arrived in New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan to the Jews\n19\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 28 PageID #: 6903\nwho have come to this great nation in recent years. We believe that America is a great nation\nbecause of its diversity and its robust immigrant history. The NYBR proudly collaborates with\nlegal and advocacy groups to support Dreamers and to keep our Nation's doors open to those\nwho seek refuge on our shores. Recently we partnered with UNICEF USA to help Syrian\nrefugees who are living in the United States. Our tradition teaches us to \"welcome the stranger,\"\ncreatedintheimageof Godandarespectedmemberofthehuman family.\n61.New York Conference United Church of Christ\nThe New York Conference United Church of Christ consists of over 270 local churches\nand 30,000 members, encompassing the entirety of New York State. The Conference is one of\nthirty-eight regional bodies of the United Church of Christ. We are committed to being led by\nthe Spirit to faithful witness, compassionate justice, and bold Christian leadership. Guided by\nthis mission, the ministries of the New York Conference, in all its settings, respond to the Still\nSpeaking God and the gospel call for peace and justice. Embracing the United Church of\nChrist’s vision of “A Just World For All,” we believe that the elimination of the Deferred Action\nfor Childhood Arrivals Program is contrary to our faith, which affirms the dignity and worth of\nall people regardless of countryof origin or extent of documentation. The gospel of Jesus Christ\ncompels us to extend an extravagant welcome to all, so that all may experience a “more and\nbetter life than they ever dreamed of” (John 10:10 The Message). The New York Conference\nsigns on to this brief in support of all the Dreamers who are not only members of our\ncongregations but ourneighbors andfriends.\n62.PacificNorthwestConferenceof theUnited Church of Christ\nThe Pacific Northwest Conference of the United Church of Christ (PNCUCC) is an\norganization of approximately 80 churches in Washington State, North Idaho and Alaska. Our\nConstitution and Bylaws open with this scriptural guidance; “The Lord has told us what is good.\nWhat God requires of us is this: to do what is just, to show constant love, and to live in humble\nfellowship with our God.” Out of this call from God, PNCUCC recently passed a resolution\ntitled “A Call to Become Immigrant and Refugee Welcoming as a Conference and in\nCongregations.” This resolution is based on the belief that every immigrant and refugee has\ninherent dignity and human rights; that every immigrant and refugee should be able to live in\nsafety, to live without fear, and have access to basic necessities and opportunities. Our churches\nlive this out through works of direct service, worship, and advocacy. The repeal of DACA\nwould mean the government would stand between us and those we are called to serve. It would\nmake it much more difficult, and in some cases impossible, for us to fulfill the mission we’ve\ndiscernedGodis callingus to.\n63.Presbyteryof New York City\nThe Presbytery of New York City began with immigrants who came to America more\nthan 350 years ago and remains the most diverse presbyteryin the United States. The Presbytery\ncontinues to aid and build up, and give hope to past and present immigrants and their children in\nour 100 congregations in the City of New York. The call to end DACA is unjust to people we\nknow in our congregations who have played by the rules previously asked and expected a more\nwelcoming path to American citizenship. Bible studies have dwindled; businesses have closed;\n20\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 28 PageID #: 6904\nDACA young adults have grown fearful and heard expulsive and assuming statements made to\nthem with no basis in fact. It feels to us as a people of faith like ethnic cleansing and a return to\nwhite nationalist rule that belies and interferes with our calling by God to minister to the\nsojourner, the immigrant, the refugee, the destitute, and to love all our neighbors as we love\nourselves.\n64.Queens Federation of Churches\nThe Queens Federation of Churches was organized in 1931 and is an ecumenical\nassociation of Christian churches located in the Borough of Queens, City of New York. It is\ngoverned by a Board of Directors composed of equal number of clergy and lay members elected\nby the delegates of member congregations at an annual assembly meeting. Over 390 local\nchurches representing every major Christian denomination and many independent congregations\nparticipate in the Federation’s ministry. Our ecumenical ministry in the nation’s most diverse\ncounty finds many congregations ministering to immigrants. Our concern to protect their God-\ngiven right to be in our part of the global household of God is paramount. Therefore, especially,\nwestronglysupport legal status forthosewhocametothis countryas children.\n65.Religious Institute\nFounded in 2001, the Religious Institute is a multi-faith organization dedicated to\nadvocating for sexual, gender, and reproductive health, education, and justice in faith\ncommunities and society. With a network of more than 8,500 religious leaders and people of\nfaith, the Religious Institute has a record of creating campaigns that mobilize thousands of\nreligious leaders and hundreds of faith communities. The Religious Institute also has long-\nstanding partnerships with graduate theological schools, denominations, religious organizations,\nand sexual, gender, and reproductive justice organizations . In all our work, we offer prophetic,\nmoral leadership at the intersection of religion and sexuality, gender, and reproductive health. As\npart of that prophetic leadership, we oppose the termination of the DACA program. We hold\nthat all people should be able to live and create families with dignity and respect, free from fear\nand state-based violence. The sacred worth of all people is inherent and in no waydependent on\nperformance,productivity, orso-called ‘economic value.’\n66.Romemu\nRomemu is a Jewish community that seeks to integrate body, mind, and soul in a\nprogressive, fully egalitarian community committed to tikkun olam, or social action, and to\nservice that flows from an identification with the sacredness of all life. As a spiritual community\ngrounded in the twin values of tikkun olam (social action) and a Divine connection meant to\ninspire us to live more holy and engaged lives, we feel that it is our duty and responsibility to\nspeak out against injustice. As a Jewish community engaged with our historical narratives, we\nknow that a large part of our own story has been shaped by being refugees and foreigners in\nstrange lands. It is for this reason that the most repeated injunction in the Torah is the\ncommandment to take care of and love the stranger. We know from our own families and\nhistorical stories what it is like to be strangers, and we are grateful and loyal to this country for\nthe opportunities and blessings that it has provided. We have an obligation as religious, moral,\n21\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 22 of 28 PageID #: 6905\nand compassionate individuals to make sure that America continues to be a place where those\nmarginalizedcanfindeconomicsecurity,freedom,andhope.\nFor all of these reasons and many more, we object to the repeal of the DACA program.\nAs a faith community, we must advocate for our at-risk brothers and sisters regardless of their\nreligion,ethnicity,or countryoforigin.Webelieveinequalityofopportunityfor all.\n67.SantaFeMonthlyMeetingof theReligiousSocietyof Friends (Quakers)\nDACA is important to our Meeting because as Quakers we are guided by the values of\nEquality and Community not only within our Meeting but also in the world around us. We care\nabout DACA recipients because they are threatened with an assault on their humanity—tearing\nthem away from their homes, often the only homes they know, uprooting them from their\nfamilies, jeopardizing their education and employment and denying them their fundamental\nhuman dignity. We cannot be faithful to the Light that Spirit has granted us and ignore what is\nbeingdoneinournametothesebrothers andsisters.\n68.Second Presbyterian Church,Albuquerque,New Mexico\nWe support the principles of universal human rights and believe there is an onus of\nsociety to support the most vulnerable members of society. We find this consistent with biblical\nethics and with ideals our country is founded on. Ending DACA would be an assault on\nvulnerable, contributing members of society and the consequences would be damaging to\nindividuals, families, andourcountry.\n69.Sikh Coalition\nThe Sikh Coalition is a community-based civil rights organization that defends civil\nliberties, including religious freedom, for all Americans. Our mission is to promote educational\nawareness and advocacy, and provide legal representation in moving towards a world where\nSikhs and other religious minorities may freely practice their faith without bias and\ndiscrimination. We are the largest community-based Sikh civil rights organization in the United\nStates. Since its inception on September 11, 2001, the Sikh Coalition has worked to defend civil\nrights and liberties for all people, empower the Sikh community, create an environment where\nSikhs can lead a dignified life unhindered by bias or discrimination, and educate the broader\ncommunity about Sikhism in order to promote cultural understanding and diversity. The Sikh\nCoalition has vindicated the rights of numerous Sikh Americans subjected to bias and\ndiscrimination because of their faith. Ensuring the rights of religious and other minorities is a\ncornerstone of the Sikh Coalition’s work, includingthe individuals who would be affected bythe\nrescissionofDACA.\n70.Sisterhood of SalaamShalom\nWe are the only national grassroots organization dedicated to building trust, respect and\nrelationships between Muslim and Jewish women.

Within our community we have a standing\nSOJAC (Social Action Justice Committee) and an Immigrant Rights Action Team that seek to\norganize our members in support of fair and just immigration policies and to stand up for\nimmigrant rights. We are active members of the Synagogue Coalition for Refugees and\nImmigrants, a coalition of New York synagogues fighting for the rights and dignity of refugees\nand immigrants. We believe that Dreamers contribute greatly to our society and believe they\nshouldbegiven apathwaytocitizenship.\n72.St.Andrew Presbyterian Church in Albuquerque,New Mexico\nOur congregation, founded in 1959, is part of the Presbytery of Santa Fe, Presbyterian\nChurch (U.S.A.). Our mission is to proclaim and live the Good News of Jesus Christ by:\nlistening to a loving God; celebrating our faith together; nurturing each other in Christian love\nand spiritual growth; working for social justice and peace; reaching out in compassionate\nservice; andbeingstewards ofall God’s gifts.\nIn March2017,St.AndrewPresbyterianChurch declareditselftobean allychurchtothe\nSanctuary Movement. Since then we have provided financial support and volunteers to the\nmovement, offered educational forums about immigration and participated in acts of public\nwitness in support of undocumented immigrants and immigration policy reform. We do so\nbecause as Christians we are called to love our neighbor as ourselves, and Jesus puts no\nlimitation on our love of neighbor. The undocumented young people who are covered under\nDACA are our neighbors. The repeal of DACA would tear apart their families and our\ncommunities, causingirreparableharm.\n73.St.Luke’s Episcopal Church in LongBeach\nSt. Luke’s Episcopal Church in Long Beach was the first parish to declare itself a\nsanctuary parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. St. Luke’s sees our commitment of\nstanding with the oppressed and fighting against systems of oppression as part of our baptismal\ncovenant. We welcome everyone equally and enthusiastically. Whatever religious background,\nage,race, gender,sexual orientation,oreconomic status, wewelcome all. Scriptureis clear that\nwe should welcome the stranger in our midst and love one another as ourselves. St. Luke’s\nstrives to be a beacon of hope to all immigrants and people who are marginalized by an unjust\nsociety.\n74.St.Mark’s Episcopal Church (Albuquerque,New Mexico)\nSt. Mark’s Episcopal Church is committed to pursuinghuman rights and social justice for\nall people residing in our country and for this reason we call for the ongoing support of DACA\n23\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 24 of 28 PageID #: 6907\nrecipients. It seems a cruel policychange to rescind protections and pathways to participation in\nour country for those who registered in good faith with our government. We believe that our\ndefining story and scriptures teach us to welcome the stranger and the sojourner in our land. We\nvalue the lives of immigrants and know that their contributions to our economy, culture and\nnational life are invaluable. We desire the continuation of DACA to ensure that these young\npeople will be given the opportunity to thrive in safety so that they may offer their perspectives,\ningenuity and creativity to our national life. Our baptismal covenant includes the vow to \"seek\nand serve Christ in all people, loving our neighbors as ourselves.\" DACA recipients,\nimmigrants, and refugees are our neighbors and we are compelled by our faith to seek and serve\nChrist in each one of them. Our baptismal covenant also includes the vow to \"strive for justice\nand peace and respect the dignityof everyhuman person.\" We believe that justice and peace are\nserved when the rights of all people--especially vulnerable people, including immigrants and\nrefugees, areprotected.\n75.St.Stephens’EpiscopalChurch in Boston\nSt. Stephens’ Episcopal Church of Boston, MA serves the South End/Lower Roxbury\nCommunity. We seek to meet the out-of-school time needs of young people and families in\nBoston and Chelsea. The decision to end DACA would impact individuals and families who\nreside in our parishes and broader communities. Ending residency for those currently protected\nby the DREAM Act would move our country further away from the principles of justice that we\nseek as people of faith. In addition, supporting those impacted bythe ending of the DREAM act\nwould add to our already demanding program load—thereby negatively affecting the entire\ncommunity. We add our voice to those asking the court to protect Dreamers by not to allowing\ntheterminationorderto gointoeffect.\n76.T’ruah:TheRabbinicCall forHuman Rights\nT’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights is a network of 1,800 rabbis and cantors\nfrom all streams of Judaism that, together with the Jewish community, act on the Jewish\nimperative to respect and advance the human rights of all people. Grounded in Torah and our\nJewish historical experience and guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we call\nupon Jews to assert Jewish values by raising our voices and taking concrete steps to protect and\nexpand human rights in North America, Israel, and the occupied Palestinian territories. T'ruah's\nsupport of DACA is based in Jewish tradition and history. The Torah teaches the obligation to\nlove the immigrant, just as God loves and cares for the immigrant: “The ger (immigrant) who\nsojourns with you shall be like a citizen unto you, and you shall love this person as yourself, for\nyou were gerim in the land of Egypt. I am Adonai, your God.” (Leviticus 19:34) The ancient\nrabbis taught that the city of Sodom was considered the epitome of evil because the residents\nmade laws prohibiting kindness to strangers. In addition, within the Jewish community, many\nfamilies are alive today because of the relatively open immigration policies of the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. And too many Jews died after being trapped in Europe when the borders\nclosed in 1924. We understand the crueltyof forcing Dreamers back to the countries where they\nwere born, but in many cases have never lived, and where — in some cases — their lives will be\nindanger.\n24\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 28 PageID #: 6908\n77.TempleIsrael of theCityof New York\nTemple Israel of the City of New York, founded in 1870, is a Reform Jewish synagogue\nthat welcomes all who choose to worship, study and celebrate within the Jewish community.\nLocated on the Upper East Side on 75th street between Park and Lexington Avenues, we are a\ndynamic, inclusive neighborhood community. As a family of families, we are committed to\nbuilding a diverse and inclusive congregation united by humanitarian values as expressed in our\nJewish religious, educational, justice and social activities, and through these activities to create a\nrich, vibrant Judaism that enriches the lives of our congregants and responds to the demands of\nmodernlife.\nTemple Israel of the City of New York stands on core Jewish values that affirm life and\nfreedoms. Our people have been immigrants and refugees in need of aid from our ancestral days\nto now, and across our world history one of the greatest homes we have ever found is the United\nStates of America. It is important to us that we keep America open as a land of opportunity for\nimmigrants and refugees as it has been a promised land for so many. With that, to take awaythis\ngreat land of freedom from someone who has grown up in this country, is at home in this\ncountry, would be shameful and un-American; it goes against what makes America great, and to\ngobackon this promise alreadymade makes it evenworse.The Torahtells us 36times to aidthe\nplight of the immigrant. Taking awaythe hand DACA has alreadyextended is detrimental to our\nneighborhood, our New York City, our state, and country. We would see it reinstated\nimmediately.\n78.TempleSinai (Washington,DC)\nTemple Sinai is one of the largest Reform Jewish congregations in the Washington, DC\narea. Organized in 1951, the congregation has over 1,200 member families. The Temple Sinai\ncommunity offers a great breadth of opportunities for participating in worship, programs, and\nservices for all ages, as well as a remarkable Religious education program and NAEYC-\naccredited Nursery School. The temple’s mission statement and core values incorporate the\nprimary reasons members belong to Temple Sinai – ritual observance, Jewish education, tikkun\nolam (repairing the world), belonging to a Jewish community and concern for Israel as a Jewish\nhomeland. Temple Sinai has a distinguished tradition in each of these areas, with our particular\nfocus throughthelens of Reform Judaism.\nTemple Sinai is committed to working on immigration issues in our country. Our own\nJewish historyof displacement as well as the Biblical injunction to “welcome the stranger” guide\nus in our work to welcome refugees, support those facing deportation, and strongly oppose the\nsuspensionofDACA.\n79.Town and VillageSynagogue,New York,New York\nTown and Village Synagogue is an egalitarian, traditional synagogue, affiliated with the\nConservative Movement. Located in lower Manhattan, NYC, T&V welcomes all people to\nshare in its activities irrespective of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or religion. In its\nstrategic plan T&V identifies as one of its \"Core Values\" Gemilut Hasadim (loving kindness)\n\"caring for one another; committed to social justice and Tikkun Olam (social responsibility);\n25\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 26 of 28 PageID #: 6909\nengaged with our local and global communities for the betterment of all.\" It is joining in this\nAmicus to fulfill the Biblical precept that there be \"one law for the citizen and for the stranger\nwhodwells among you\" (Exodus 12:49).\nT&V oppose changes to the DACA program that will affect those brought here as\nchildren, some of whom are still attending school or higher education, or currently work here\nand who have known no other home than the United States. If DACA were to be terminated,\nthese young people -- Americans in every respect but citizenship -- could be deported to\ndangerous countries they have never known, separated from their families, and forced to survive\nalone, many without even knowing the language. Members of the synagogue have attended\nworkshops to help immigrants get their affairs in order should they face sudden arrest or\ndeportationorders, as immigrationpolicies aresummarilychanged.\n80.TrinityChurch Wall Street\nTrinity Church Wall Street is a vibrant and growing Episcopal parish in Lower\nManhattan. Guided by our core values of faith, integrity, inclusiveness, compassion, social\njustice and stewardship, Trinity’s mission is to build our neighborhood, train leaders of Christian\ncommunities for the future, and help our partners become financially sustainable to support their\nministries. Trinity is committed to serving the most vulnerable in our neighborhood and to\nadvocating for justice on behalf of those whose voices are not heard, including immigrants and\n“Dreamers.” We support fairness and safety for immigrants, whose contributions are essential to\nourcityandournation,andinthat spirit,weopposetheterminationofDACA.\nWe are concerned that ending DACA will mean that vulnerable people in our\ncommunities will be deported to countries they have little experience of, leaving dependent\nfamily members here; will lead them to live outside of the legal protections of New York City\nout of fear for their own safety; and will cause them to avoid the police, hospitals, schools, and\nother services designed for individual and public safety. Furthermore, the repeal of DACA is a\nturning back of policy that asked undocumented people to register with the government in return\nfor a protected status. The fact that such registration is being used to target and deport them is a\nprofound betrayal of trust by the U.S. government that should give pause to any immigrant to\nthis countryofimmigrants.\n81.Union forReformJudaism,includingtheReformJewish Voiceof New York State\n82.Central Conferenceof American Rabbis\n83.Women of ReformJudaism\nThe Union for Reform Judaism, whose 900 congregations across North America includes\n1.5 million Reform Jews (including those that participate in Reform Jewish Voice of New York\nState), the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), whose membership includes more\nthan 2000 Reform rabbis, and Women of Reform Judaism that represents more than 65,000\nwomeninnearly500women's groups in North America and around theworld,come tothis issue\nrooted in both our Jewish tradition and our historical experience. Together, they lead us to\nsupport immigrationpolicythat is compassionate andfair.\n26\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 27 of 28 PageID #: 6910\n84.Unitarian UniversalistMass Action Network\nUnitarian Universalist Mass Action Network is a state action network that works in\ncoalition with interfaith partners and organizations led by those who are directly affected by\ninjustice. Our mission is to organize and mobilize Unitarian Universalists to confront\noppression. It is through oursocial justiceworkthat weliveourvalues and principles that define\nour faith. One manifestation of oppression in which we deeply engage is immigrant rights. The\nlevel of cruelty, ignorance and hateful attacks perpetrated on immigrant communities is an\noffensive affront to human values. We are dedicated to confrontingthese attacks on families and\nthe safety of our communities through building resistance networks. We support the DACA\nprogram and DACA recipients as part of our overall support for all immigrants. All families\ndeserve the right remain together. Young people who have grown up in the US, were educated\ninourschool systems andareintegral members ofour communities deservetohave apathwayto\na legal status that allows them to work and obtain a post-secondary education. UU Mass Action\nworks closely with many young leaders who have DACA status. Their families and friends are\nhere and the only country they know is the US. Deporting these young people to a country\nwhere they typically know no one puts their lives in danger. Tearing families apart and\nendangeringlives is immoral. Wewill not remainsilent andallowthis tooccur.\n85.Visitation BVMChurch in Philadelphia,Pennsylvania\nVisitation BVM is a multicultural Catholic parish located in the Kensington section of\nNorth Philadelphia. The majority of our parishioners come from Puerto Rico, the Dominican\nRepublic, México, Honduras, Ecuador and Vietnam. Our mission is to preach Good News to an\nimmigrant community who often struggle in their day to day living situations. These challenges\nhaveonlyincreasedover thepast year as someof ourmembers havebeen detainedordeported.\nMany of our young adults are protected by DACA, including our Pastoral Outreach\nAssistant. These young people call the United States their home. Somehave little to nomemory\nof the countries where they were born. They are in college or working as they strive to become\nproductive members of society. These Dreamers are nervous about their future and want to\nmaketheirfamilies andtheirlives hereinthe U.S.-thecountrytheycall home.\nOur church is a member of the New Sanctuary Movement and we were very involved in\nthe sanctuary effort of Angela Navarro two years ago. We provided spiritual and material\nsupport to her and her family over the months she was in sanctuary. The Archdiocese of\nPhiladelphia does not allow Catholic Churches to offer sanctuary so we collaborated with a\nneighboring Presbyterian Church. Our institution has not directly been the target of ICE raids\nbut theyhavetakenplace intheneighborhood.\n86.WestEnd Synagogue(New York City)\nWest End Synagogue is a Reconstructionist congregation, affiliated with the\nReconstructionist Movement. Located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, NYC, West End\nSynagogue is a diverse group of individuals and families committed to exploring Jewish life and\ncreating an intellectually challenging, spiritually vibrant, and mutually supportive community.\nUtilizing the principles of Reconstructionist Judaism, we celebrate the richness and diversity of\n27\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 170-1   Filed 12/22/17   Page 28 of 28 PageID #: 6911\nJewish tradition through study, prayer, meditation, music and tikkun olam, or acts of repairing\ntheworld.\nWest End Synagogue opposes changes to the DACA program that will affect those\nbrought here as children. Many of these children are attending school, pursuing higher\neducation, or working here and have known no other home than the United States. If DACA\nwere to be terminated, these young people—Americans in every respect but citizenship -- could\nbe deported to dangerous countries they have never known. They would be separated from their\nfamilies, and forced to survive alone, manywithout even knowing the language. As immigrants,\nor children and grandchildren of immigrants who fled oppression, we are particularlysensitive to\nthe situation of these young people who call the United States home. According to the Torah,\n“You shall treat the stranger as your own.” Maintaining the DACA program is a critical step in\nthis direction.\n87.Westminster Presbyterian Church ofSantaFé\nOur congregation is fully inclusive and affirming of all people regardless of nationality,\nimmigration status, ethnicity, social status or gender and sexual orientation, and a member of the\nPresbytery of Santa Fé and the Presbyterian Church (USA). Our denomination has consistently\nand historically expressed support for the values, safety, gifts, and perspective for immigrants of\nall nations, and has also called for the ongoing support and protection of DACA recipients. By\nsigning on to the Amicus Brief, we reiterate our belief that justice and peace are served when the\nrights of all people—especially vulnerable people, including immigrants and refugees, are\nprotected.\n28",

Amici are a leading national association of local law enforcement executives \nand current and former individual police chiefs, sheriffs, and law enforcement leaders.  Amici have \ndeep and wide-ranging expertise in local law enforcement and in cooperative federal-state law \nenforcement activities.  They are intimately familiar with the difficulties of performing critical law \nenforcement  functions  in  communities  where  immigrants  fear  the  police  and  therefore  are \nespecially vulnerable to exploitation and crime.  \n Amici’s  experience  in  keeping  their  communities  safe  has  taught  them  the  critical \nimportance of bringing immigrants and their families “out of the shadows” and into their broader \ncommunities.  Trust and cooperation are essential to public safety, and sound police work is \nundermined when undocumented immigrants fear interacting with law enforcement.  This fear, \nmoreover, leaves undocumented immigrants more vulnerable to crime and exploitation, leading to \nmore violence in the communities that amici are charged with protecting.  \nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program protects from deportation \nnearly 800,000 individuals brought to this country as children.  Under DACA, these individuals, \nwho have undergone background checks and lived continuously in the United States since 2007, \nhave been permitted to live, work, and study in this country without fear of deportation.  Amici \nhave witnessed firsthand how the DACA program has helped law enforcement officers to keep \ntheir communities safe by taking away the fear of removal from these nearly 800,000 individuals \nwho are active members of their communities.  A full list of amici is attached as Exhibit A.\n1 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 6605\nINTRODUCTION \nThe lessons that amici have learned in protecting their communities shed important light \non the issues raised in this case.  Community policing, a philosophy that calls for trust and \nengagement between law enforcement and those whom they protect, is vital to effective police \nwork and, in turn, to public safety.  That trust is undermined when undocumented individuals fear \ninteraction with the police, and law enforcement suffers as a result.  Extensive evidence shows \nthat, especially without programs such as DACA in place, undocumented immigrants—and their \nlawfully present family and neighbors—fear that turning to the police to report crimes or engaging \nwith the police as they investigate crimes will bring adverse immigration consequences.  As a \nresult,  immigrant  communities  are  less  willing  to  report  crimes  or  cooperate  with  police \ninvestigations.  This fundamental breakdown in trust poses a major challenge for police not only \nas they seek to protect communities but also as they attempt to allocate resources sensibly in the \ninterest of public safety.  \nDACA  ameliorates  these  problems  by  addressing  an  important  reason  that  many \nindividuals fear cooperating with law enforcement.  As experience with DACA has shown, when \nimmigrants are permitted to step out of the shadows, they are much more willing to work \ncooperatively with police.  As explained below, nearly two-thirds of DACA recipients reported \nbeing less afraid of law enforcement, and 59 percent indicated that they would report a crime now \nin a situation in which they would not have reported it before entering the program.  DACA further \naids  law  enforcement  by  facilitating  access  to  identification,  such  as  federal  employment \nauthorization documents.  Lack of identification in immigrant communities often leads to undue \nburdens on police, potentially turning a simple traffic stop into an hours-long detour to fingerprint \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 8 of 22 PageID #: 6606\nsomeone at the police station.  When police are able to identify victims, witnesses, and potential \nsuspects without those sorts of delays, valuable law enforcement resources are spared. \nDACA also benefits public safety by helping law enforcement to protect a population \nuniquely vulnerable to exploitation and violent crime.  Numerous studies show that undocumented \nindividuals’ fear of interactions with law enforcement makes them attractive targets for many \nforms of crime and abuse.  Undocumented immigrants, for instance, face increased wage theft and \nother forms of exploitation in the workplace.  With limited access to bank accounts (in substantial \npart because of their lack of identification), they have been dubbed by some as “walking ATMs” \nand are frequently targeted for robbery.  Undocumented individuals are also especially vulnerable \nto domestic abuse because they are often afraid to turn to law enforcement for help against abusive \npartners.  \nBy  eliminating  an  important  reason  to  fear  law  enforcement,  by  providing  work \nauthorization and access to identification, and by building trust between police and immigrants \nwith longstanding ties to the United States, DACA aids community policing and makes recipients \nless vulnerable to crime and exploitation.  In doing so, DACA provides vital support to police \ncharged with protecting everyone in their communities. \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  DACA Fosters Effective Law Enforcement.  \n \nA.  “Community Policing” Is Essential to Effective Law Enforcement. \n \nAs one major city police chief has explained, the experience of policing cities across the \ncountry has taught law enforcement officers that, “[t]o do our job, we must have the trust and \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 6607\nrespect of the communities we serve.”1  In order to stop crime, police officers “need the full \ncooperation of victims and witnesses.”2 \nThis common-sense philosophy has come to be called “community policing.”  Community \npolicing is an approach to policing whereby police officers engage communities in a working \npartnership to reduce crime and promote public safety.3  It thus requires police to interact with \nneighborhood residents in a manner that will build trust and improve the level of cooperation with \nthe police department.4  When that relationship of trust is missing—as it is when people believe \nthat contacting police could lead to deportation for themselves or others—community policing \nbreaks down and the entire community is left at greater risk of exploitation and violence. \nB.  DACA Promotes Cooperation with Law Enforcement. \nThe reality of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States poses \nsignificant challenges to effective community policing.   \nAccording to a Pew survey, 57 percent of Latinos in the United States indicate that they \nworry about deportation—of themselves, family members, or close friends—and 40 percent worry \nabout it “a lot.”5  This fear necessarily affects cooperation and communication with the police. \n                                                           \n1 Oversight of the Administration’s Misdirected Immigration Enforcement Policies: Examining the \nImpact of Public Safety and Honoring the Victims: Hearing Before the S.

Even when local authorities play no role in immigration enforcement, many immigrants \nstill associate police with immigration authorities, or expect police to inquire about immigration \nstatus.6  \nAs  a  result,  immigrant  communities  in  general,  and  undocumented  immigrants  in \nparticular, are less likely to trust and cooperate with local police.  In one survey of Latinos in four \nmajor cities designed to assess the impact of police involvement in immigration enforcement on \npublic safety and police-community relations, 70 percent of undocumented immigrants and 44 \npercent of all Latinos said they would be less likely to contact law enforcement authorities if they \nwere victims of a crime for fear that the police would ask them or people they know about their \nimmigration status; and 67 percent of undocumented immigrants and 45 percent of all Latinos said \nthey would be less likely to voluntarily offer information about, or report, crimes because of the \nsame fear.7     \n                                                           \nMeasures  at  ii  (Sept.  18,  2008),  http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php \n?ReportID=93. \n6 See, e.g., Police Exec.

In one study, two-thirds \nof the law enforcement officers polled held the view that recent immigrants reported crimes less \nfrequently  than  others.8    Those  surveyed  also  indicated  that  the  crimes  underreported  by \nimmigrants most often are serious ones, with domestic violence and gang violence at the top of \nthe list.9  The widely recognized fear among immigrants of interacting with law enforcement poses \na fundamental challenge for community policing.  Police cannot prevent or solve crimes if victims \nor witnesses are unwilling to talk to them because of concerns that they or their loved ones or \nneighbors will face adverse immigration consequences.  As the president of the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation has explained to Congress, “[c]ooperation is not forthcoming from persons who see \ntheir police as immigration agents.”10 Moreover, as cautioned by one official, “immigrants will \nnever help their local police to fight crime once they fear we have become immigration officers.”11 \nThe underreporting of crimes by recent immigrants is a problem for the criminal justice \nsystem.12  The most immediate consequence, of course, is that serious crimes go unreported and \nunpunished.  At a broader level, undercounting the incidence of crime in areas where immigrant \ncommunities  live  leads  to  the  under-allocation  of  law  enforcement  resources  to  those \n                                                           \n8 Robert C.

Instead, they \nwould retain greater freedom to cooperate in the protection of their communities without worrying \nabout how their good deed might be punished—for example, by causing them to be separated from \ntheir family members, siblings, or loved ones.  \nLessons learned from implementation of the Violence Against Women Act of 200018 are \ninstructive.    With  that  Act,  congress  created  the  U  visa  to  provide  immigration  relief  to \nundocumented victims of certain crimes.19  Like DACA qualification, a U visa allows recipients \n                                                           \n13 Id. \n14 Id. \n15 Id. \n16 Zenén Jaimes Pérez, United We Dream, A Portrait of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nRecipients:  Challenges  and  Opportunities  Three-Years  Later  23  (June  2015), \nhttp://unitedwedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DACA-report-final-1.pdf. \n17 Roberto G.

A recent study indicated \nthat U visa applicants and recipients, freed of the need to remain in the shadows, became far more \nlikely to cooperate with law enforcement in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of \ncrimes.21  Indeed, more than 99 percent stated that they were willing to cooperate with the police, \nand 70 percent were in fact asked to—and did—provide assistance related to crimes committed \nagainst them.22  That U-visa holders who seek lawful permanent residency are expected to provide \n“reasonably requested information and assistance” to law enforcement in connection with the \ncrimes that qualify them for immigration relief undoubtedly helps explain the especially high level \nof cooperation, but the protections offered by the U-visa are what enable that cooperation.23  \nAnother study revealed that three-quarters of law enforcement officers view U visas as beneficial \nin encouraging victims to come forward and report crimes.24 \nC.  DACA Aids Law Enforcement by Facilitating Access to Identification. \nA further benefit of DACA for effective policing follows from the greater availability of \nidentification.  Because most states do not issue driver’s licenses or other identification to \nundocumented immigrants, law enforcement often face serious difficulties reliably identifying \n                                                           \ntrafficking-other-crimes/victims-criminal-activity-u-nonimmigrant-status/victims-criminal-\nactivity-u-nonimmigrant-status (last updated Aug. 25, 2017). \n20 See id. \n21 See Leslye Orloff, Levi Wolberg & Benish Anver, Nat’l Ctr. on Domestic & Sexual Violence,  \nU-Visa Victims and Lawful Permanent Residency 5-6 (Sept. 6, 2012), http://www.ncdsv.org/ \nimages/NIWAP_U-VisaVictimsAndLawfulPermanentResidency_9-6-12.pdf.  \n22 Id.   \n23 See id. at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). As set forth supra, note 17, there is a similar \nresult from the DACA program, which involves no expectation of law enforcement cooperation.  \n24 Natalia Lee et al., Nat’l Immigrant Women’s Advocacy Project, National Survey of Service \nProviders on Police Response to Immigrant Crime Victims, U Visa Certification and Language \nAccess 21 (Apr. 16, 2013), available at http://www.niwap.org/reports/Police-Response-U-Visas-\nLanguage-Access-Report-4.6.13.pdf.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 6612\nundocumented community members.  Ready access to identification aids law enforcement in the \nmost basic of ways: if the police cannot verify who someone is, it becomes much harder to identify \nwitnesses and victims, investigate potential suspects, and perform critical tasks like searching for \na criminal history, investigating outstanding warrants, and determining whether someone poses a \nthreat.25 \nEven the simplest traffic stop can lead to an unnecessary waste of valuable law enforcement \nresources if an individual cannot be identified.  If an officer stops a motorist who does not have a \nlicense or other verifiable identification, the officer may have no other option than to arrest the \nindividual, bring him to the station, and obtain fingerprint information in order to identify the \nindividual.  As one police chief has explained, “[w]hen we stop cars and the driver doesn’t have a \ndriver’s license, there are very few options for the officers and troopers.”26  The only way to \nreliably identify the individual may be through fingerprints, requiring a detour to “jail so we can \nfind out who they are.”27  Another former police chief lamented the “manpower” required and time \nlost—“up to two to three hours to determine who an arrestee is”—which could be devoted to more \npressing law enforcement concerns.28 \nRecipients of DACA are eligible to apply for a federal employment authorization document \n(“EAD”).  The EAD comes in the form of a card issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n                                                           \n25 Police Exec.

Times, Dec. \n23, 2015 (describing municipal identification and stating, “[t]he mayor emphasized that the cards \nwere developed with input from the New York City Police Department and said the department \nhad been one of the biggest backers of the program. ‘They want every New Yorker on the street \nto have an ID card; it greatly improves the work of the NYPD,’ Mr. de Blasio said.”). \n26 See id. at 15-16. \n27 Id. at 16.  \n28 Id. at 15. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 6613\nServices,  and  includes  the  recipient’s  photograph.29    Individuals  who  receive  employment \nauthorization also are eligible to obtain a Social Security number and card.30  Because DACA has \nexpanded availability of identification, it has assisted law enforcement officers’ ability to identify \nthose whom they encounter.31  Instead of time-consuming, wasteful, and potentially antagonistic \nencounters with individuals who pose no public safety concern, police have more time to focus on \nhigher priorities in keeping their communities safe. \nII.  DACA Helps Law Enforcement Protect Vulnerable Individuals from Crime \nand Exploitation.  \n \nDACA has yielded another vital public safety benefit: protecting individuals who are \nattractive targets for criminals.  \nAs discussed above, undocumented immigrants as well as their families fear interactions \nwith police and are reluctant to report crimes when doing so is accompanied by the fear of removal. \nNo one knows this better than the predators who seek to take advantage of immigrant communities’ \nvulnerabilities.  These communities face a range of misconduct, from abuse by unscrupulous \nemployers to domestic and gang violence.32  “When immigrants come to view their local police \n                                                           \n29 See 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14); see also U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \nU.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., OMB No. 1615-0040, Instructions for I-765 Application \nfor Employment Authorization (Nov. 2015) (describing EAD as a “card” and requiring two \npassport-style  photos),  available  at  https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-\n765instr.pdf. \n30 See Soc.

In a number of studies, between 40 and \n80 percent of mostly undocumented immigrants reported being victims of wage theft.36  Many \nimmigrants also reported other types of worksite abuse.37  In one study, 32 percent of respondents \nsaid that they had suffered on-the-job injuries—and most of these individuals, after being injured, \nwere fired, not paid lost wages, or denied medical care by their employers.38 \nThe deportation threat dynamic fuels not only exploitation but also outright violence.  An \nadvocate reported that, when one worker attempted to collect wages his employer owed him, “[t]he \ncontractor raised his shirt and showed he had a gun—and that was enough. . . .

The worker left.”39  DACA recipients are currently eligible to receive work \nauthorization, and many are currently working or pursuing higher educational opportunities. \nRevocation of their work authorization will leave them more vulnerable to exploitation and even \nviolent crime.  \nThis same lawlessness plaguing undocumented communities extends well beyond the \nworkplace.  Nearly two-thirds of undocumented migrant workers participating in a Memphis study \nreported being the victim of at least one crime, most commonly theft or robbery.40  Respondents \nindicated that fewer than a quarter of these crimes were reported to the police, and only one was \nreported by the victim himself.41 \nAs this study suggests, robbery and similar crimes pose a particular threat to undocumented \nindividuals, who typically do not have bank accounts, in part because of their inability to obtain \ngovernment-issued identification.42  Moreover, many of these immigrants live in group apartments \nand are unable to store valuables in a safe place at home.43  As a result, undocumented immigrants \nare  known  to  carry  large  amounts  of  cash,  making  robbing  them  an  especially  lucrative \nproposition.  The risk to the perpetrators, meanwhile, is minimal because the victims are too afraid \nto report the crime to the police.  \n                                                           \n39 Id. at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n40 Jacob Bucher, Michelle Manasse & Beth Tarasawa, Undocumented Victims: An Examination of \nCrimes Against Undocumented Male Migrant Workers, 7 Sw.

Studies have shown that abusive partners may utilize the threat of deportation in order \nto maintain power and control over their victims.47  When the abusing partner has lawful status, \nfinancial dependence on that partner may similarly allow for the perpetuation of violence.48  \nSeventy  percent  of  participants  in  one  study  of  domestic  abuse  victims  said  that \nimmigration status was a major impediment to their seeking help or reporting their abuse to the \nauthorities and thereby permitting the violence to continue.49  In another study, the single largest \n                                                           \n44 See Fussell, supra note 34, at 604-05; S.

Lohman & Marta María Maldonado, \n‘‘He Said They’d Deport Me’’: Factors Influencing Domestic Violence Help-Seeking Practices \nAmong Latina Immigrants, 29 J. Interpersonal Violence 593, 601 (2013).  The latter study cited a \nparticipant who explained that a partner “beat me up and I could have called the police because \nthat was what I thought to do . . . but he threatened me . . . he told me that if I called the police I \nwas going to lose out . . . because they [police officers] . . . would . . . take me, because I didn’t \nhave legal documents.”  Id. \n48 See, e.g., Messing, supra note 47, at 330.  \n49 Reina, Lohman & Maldonado, supra note 47, at 600. \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 155   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 6617\nfactor independently affecting the rate at which battered immigrant Latina women called the police \nwas identified as immigration status.50  \nIn short, should DACA recipients lose their work authorizations and once again fear \nremoval from the United States, their lack of status will embolden exploitative employers and \ncriminals alike and thus diminish the safety of entire communities.  By permitting these young \nindividuals to live and work openly, DACA eliminates a significant barrier to an open and trusting \nrelationship with law enforcement.  Continuing DACA will enable police to better fight crime and \nserve all those whom they are charged with protecting. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ Motion, this Court \nshould grant the relief sought by the Plaintiffs. \nDecember 22, 2017      Respectfully Submitted, \n/s/ Caryn C.

SEIU’s \nmembers include foreign-born U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and undocumented \nimmigrants authorized to work in the United States. Many of SEIU’s members have mixed-\nstatus families. As described below, SEIU members will be directly affected by the termination of \nDACA. \nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO \n(AFSCME), is a union of 1.6 million members in the United States and Puerto Rico, both in the \npublic and private sectors, who share a commitment to service. AFSCME is participating in this \ncase to advance its mission of helping all working people, including immigrants and people of \ncolor, achieve the American dream regardless of their identity. AFSCME is proud to represent \nmembers  who  came  to  the  United  States  as  children  and  who  are  contributing  to  our \ncommunities, states and country.

UFW’s members  include  foreign-born  U.S.  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, immigrants authorized to work in the United States, and undocumented \nimmigrants. Many of UFW’s members have mixed-status families, and many farmworkers have \nchildren who qualify and would qualify as DREAMers under DACA. As described below, \nUFW’s members will be directly affected by the termination of DACA. \nThe  International  Union  of  Painters  and  Allied  Trades  (IUPAT)  is  a  labor \norganization comprised of approximately 140,000 members. Our members work as commercial \nand industrial painters, glaziers, drywall finishers, floor coverers, trade show workers and in \nmany other occupations.  IUPAT welcomes any person who does the work we do. Our members \nare of many races, practice many religions, were born in many countries, speak many languages \nand have different political views. They include beneficiaries of DACA and citizens or lawful \npermanent  residents  whose  family  members  benefit  from  DACA. They,  and  many  other \nmembers, will be directly affected by the termination of DACA. \n \n   \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 7 of 24 PageID #: 6633\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThrough  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  program,  law-abiding \nundocumented young people in the United States have been able to achieve a longstanding \ndream: to become productive members of the society in which they were raised. In just five years, \nDACA recipients have made invaluable contributions to the American labor force as doctors, \nlawyers,  community  health  workers,  janitors,  homecare  providers,  and  more.  They  are  the \nworking parents and siblings of 200,000 adolescent American citizens,1 providing what is often \ntheir family’s sole source of income. The question before this Court is whether the defendants’ \nabrupt termination of this program violates the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. \nAmici submit this brief to demonstrate how rescinding DACA jeopardizes its employed \nrecipients, their families, and the country in general, while doing little to address the need to \nreform our broken immigration system. It is conservatively estimated that DACA recipients \nwould increase the gross domestic product by $215 billion and tax revenues by $60 billion over \nthe next decade.2 Terminating DACA eliminates these gains. It also denies the recipients the \nsecurity and confidence in knowing that they will return home safely to their families every day—\na fear only amplified now that the government has gained their sensitive information through the \nprogram—and severely limits their educational and employment opportunities. Multiple studies \nestablish the obvious and acute negative consequences of living in such uncertain conditions and \nhow DACA has already provided observable relief from those consequences. The experiences of \nindividual union members shared below illustrate that research, demonstrating the real human \n                                                 \n1 Priscilla Alvarez, Will DACA Parents Be Forced to Leave Their U.S.-Citizen Children Behind?, The Atlantic, Oct. \n21, 2017, https://perma.cc/XD7H-282Q. \n2 Ike Brannon & Logan Albright, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA, Cato Institute (Jan. 18, \n2017), https://perma.cc/ZH57-8D98. \n3  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 8 of 24 PageID #: 6634\ntoll  that  rescinding  DACA  will  have  on  undocumented  young  adults,  their  families,  their \ncommunities, their workplaces, and the nation.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Rescinding DACA will adversely impact employers and the U.S. economy. \nRescinding DACA subjects 800,000 young people to deportation while reducing local, \nstate, and federal revenues and forcing employers to expend significant resources to hire and \ntrain new employees. \nThe most immediate costs are those imposed on the American workplace. One study \nestimates that for “every business day DACA renewals are halted, over 1,400 jobs [will be] lost” \nin the next two years.3 This places a substantial burden on employers and employees, considering \nhow even a short-term loss of DACA work authorization can seriously hinder a workplace. Take, \nfor example, the story of Dr. T.W. in Part III of this brief. As explained in greater detail below, \nDr. T.W. is a retired NFL athlete and fifth-year medical resident in Harvard’s orthopedic surgery \ndepartment. During his intern year, he was forced to abruptly stop working for a period of six \nweeks while waiting for the extension of his DACA authorization. This created a critical void that \nthrew his surgery team into disarray because his role could not be temporarily filled. In this way, \nrescinding DACA will cause employers to grapple with the loss of staff in which they have \ninvested  while  also  forcing  them  to  absorb  unnecessary  turnover  expenses—a  cost  that  is \nprojected to total $3.4 billion for the wholesale replacement of employed DACA recipients.4 \nTerminating DACA will also mean that $24.6 billion worth of Medicare and Social \nSecurity contributions will be lost over the next ten years, as well as most of the federal and tax \n                                                 \n3 Center for American Progress & FWD.us, Study: The Impact of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \nProgram Repeal on Jobs, FWD.us, 4 (Aug. 23, 2017), https://perma.cc/3X8Q-ZJSM. \n4 Jose Magaña-Salgado, Money on the Table: The Economic Cost of Ending DACA, Immigrant Legal Resource \nCenter (Dec. 2016), https://perma.cc/S4NY-V33Z. \n4  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 9 of 24 PageID #: 6635\nrevenues generated from the 91% gainfully employed DACA recipients.5 These effects will be \nparticularly burdensome for the six states that are home to 59% of the U.S. undocumented \nimmigrant  population:  California,  Texas,  Florida,  New  York,  New  Jersey,  and  Illinois.6  By \ncontrast, DACA implementation has entailed almost no direct cost to taxpayers because the \nprogram’s overhead is covered by the $495 fee paid by the applicants. \nIn addition, the federal government’s threat to deport DACA beneficiaries would lead to \na staggering result: a burden of $7.5 billion7 on taxpayers. The public-opinion evidence suggests \nthat the American people may at some level understand this stark cost-benefit calculus: 84% of \nDemocrats, 74% of Independents, and 69% of Republicans think that DACA recipients should \nbe able to stay in the country in some way, whether through citizenship or other means.8 Costly, \nineffective, and unpopular, the deportation of these American-raised young adults would not \nrepair our broken immigration system in any real way. \nII.  Terminating the DACA program inflicts irreparable harm on DACA \nrecipients and their families, including American-citizen children. \nUndocumented  immigrants  face  a  mountain  of  hardships.  They  suffer  poverty  rates \nnearly twice that of American citizens and have a harder time escaping those conditions because \nof their status.9 Employment opportunities are generally limited to low-wage jobs, but even that \ncan be difficult to access without a driver’s license. Most undocumented immigrants also lack a \nbank account and carry cash, since “financial institutions often request U.S. identification and a \n                                                 \n5 Id. \n6 Jens Manuel Krogstad, Jeffrey S.

Added to all these \nstressors is the constant fear of being deported that wreaks havoc on mental health, causing many \nundocumented immigrants to suffer from anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.   \nWhat makes DACA so significant is that, in just five years, it has led to improved \nsocioeconomic and health outcomes—including for American-citizen children. Researchers have \nfound that the odds of life in poverty in households headed by DACA recipients fell by 38 \npercent.11 The stories of K.R. and M.R., presented in Part III below, confirm this research. K.R. \nis a 30-year-old community-health worker who is the sole caretaker of her three American-citizen \nsiblings.  Because  of  DACA,  she  is  able  to  pay  rent  for  her  family,  attend  parent-teacher \nconferences for her younger siblings, and support her brother’s university tuition. M.R. also has \nthree U.S.-citizen siblings. DACA helped him obtain a driver’s license and secure employment as \na homecare worker so that he can help his parents financially support their family and also pick \nup his siblings from school. DACA has produced these kinds of tangible gains for the majority of \nits recipients. According to one survey, the program has led to new employment for 59 percent of \nbeneficiaries, 45% of whom also experienced salary growth.12 55% of recipients were also able to \npurchase a vehicle while more than 10% purchased their first home.13  \nLooking at improved health outcomes, a study from Stanford University found that since \n2012, the diagnoses of adjustment and anxiety disorders for the American children of DACA-\n                                                 \n10 Roberto G.

As Stanford researcher Jens Hainmueller noted, “It’s not every day that \npublic policy has such an immediate effect.”16 \nBut nothing more clearly illustrates the value of DACA to its recipients than the fact that \n78% of the law-abiding, American-raised young people eligible for the program have applied17—\nin spite of its hefty $495 fee and two-year limit. Ending DACA threatens all these advances, the \nimprovements to come, and the hopes of young people like the union members and affiliates \ndescribed below.  \nIII.  Union  members  and  their  family  members  have  become  vital  parts  of \nAmerican society as a direct result of the opportunities provided to them by \nthe DACA program. \nMillions  of  employees  nationwide  are  united  in  the  amici  unions,  and  many  union \nmembers and their families will be harmed by a repeal of DACA. The experiences of individual \nunion members and their family members confirm and illustrate the social science data cited \nabove.18 \n \n                                                 \n14 Jens Hainmueller et al., Protecting unauthorized immigrant mothers improves their children’s mental health, 357 \nScience 1041, 1043 (2017).  \n15 Id. \n16 Milenko Martinovich, Rescinding DACA protections on immigrant mothers could have negative health impacts on their \nchildren, Stanford study finds, Stanford News (Sept. 7, 2017), https://perma.cc/ZMT5-K2MB.  \n17 Jens Manuel Krogstad, DACA has shielded nearly 790,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation, Pew \nResearch Center (Sept. 1, 2017), https://perma.cc/A5NW-HKYD. \n18 The individuals whose stories are told here all consented to having their experiences recounted in this \nbrief.

His wife, a U.S. citizen, is an alumni member of SEIU’s Committee of Interns and \nResidents (CIR).   \nBorn in Nigeria, Dr. T.W. came to the United States at age three with his family. The \nfamily fled political unrest in Nigeria and settled in California. Dr. T.W’s only memories are of \nlife in the United States, and he grew up believing that with hard work and commitment, he \ncould do anything. “I saw only the American Dream and truly believed if I put forth effort and \ndetermination, there was nothing I could not do.” A brilliant student and a track, wrestling and \nfootball star in high school and at Stanford University, he graduated and spent several years \nplaying football on NFL teams. \nThroughout his childhood and early adult years, Dr. T.W. believed he was American. It \nwas only when he needed his passport to travel to Canada for a position with the Canadian \nFootball League that he learned that he was not a U.S. citizen. “In some ways, the fact that I \ndidn’t know my true immigration status freed me from the stress and obstacles imposed by \nundocumented status and allowed me to imagine limitless possibilities in my life.” \nAs  Dr.  T.W.’s  football  career  ended,  he  turned  to  his  other  passion:  medicine.  He \nexcelled in his studies at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, but recognized \nthat his undocumented status would prevent his acceptance to a medical residency program in \nthe United States. “DACA saved me, it rescued me, and allowed me to pursue my medical \nresidency at the Harvard Combined Orthopaedic Residency Program at Massachusetts General \nHospital. Thank God for DACA.”   \n8  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 24 PageID #: 6639\nA six-week lapse of his DACA status served as a reminder to Dr. T.W. of the critical \nimportance of DACA to his medical career. Dr. T.W. had to stop working for 6 weeks during his \nintern year while he waited for the extension of his DACA work authorization card. “The \northopedic surgery intern functions as a crucial member of a team, and when I wasn’t able to \nwork, I let my team down, my program could not fill the void, and I was sleepless with anxiety.  \nAll of a sudden it didn’t matter that I was a doctor. Without DACA I was thrust back into the \nstatus of an unwelcome, alien intruder.” \nDr. T.W. will continue his training in orthopedic surgery, joining a fellowship program \nnext year, and working in an orthopedic surgery practice. He intends to continue serving the \ncommunity and treating muscular injuries, broken bones and a wide range of conditions. \nIn June of 2017, Dr. T.W’s application for legal residency was approved. Although he no \nlonger relies on DACA, he values the program that was vital to his medical career and his life. \nP.V.: A dedicated public servant prosecuting crime for Travis County, Texas. \nP.V. is an Assistant County Attorney for Travis County, Texas, where Austin is located.  \nAs a dedicated public servant and an AFSCME Local 1624 member, he spends his workdays as a \ncriminal prosecutor protecting public safety by handling all sorts of criminal cases from running \nred lights to DUI’s.   \nP.V. came to the United States with his family from Mexico when he was three years old.  \nHe and his family settled in the Houston area, but his living situation was difficult when he first \narrived. His father found work as a bartender and his mother as a massage therapist, and the \nfamily lived with various aunts and uncles while they got their footing.   \nP.V. knew from a young age that he wanted to create a path to success in the United \nStates and he studied hard to make that dream a reality. He graduated from high school in 2010 \nand went on to study sport management at the University of Texas, where he graduated with \n9  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 14 of 24 PageID #: 6640\nhigh honors. At first, P.V. thought he wanted to pursue a career as a sports agent, “like Jerry \nMaguire”, he said, but then decided he enjoyed public service and instead went to law school at \nUniversity of Texas. He graduated from law school in 2016 and soon after passed the Texas bar.   \nP.V. is a DACA recipient and that status is what allows him to be a dedicated public \nservant and prosecuting attorney today. Without DACA, he would not be eligible to do the work \nhe does every day for Travis County.  P.V. is the first member of his family to go to college and \ngraduate school; the first member of his family to work as a professional. Without DACA, he \nwould be “unemployable” in most workplaces, and forced to work in the underground economy \ninstead. However, because of DACA, P.V. can do the job he loves, and contribute to the \neconomy by supporting himself, paying taxes, making contributions to the county retirement \nplan.   \nHe also knows that without DACA his community would suffer dire consequences. As a \nprosecutor, P.V.’s experience has taught him that without legal status, many immigrants refuse to \nreport crimes or avoid testifying when they are victims of assaults and other crimes for fear of \ndeportation enforcement. As an immigrant himself, he knows that many immigrant families’ \nconduit  to  law  enforcement  and  the  community  at  large  is  through  their  DACA  recipient \nchildren who serve as their “ambassadors”.   \nP.V. wants to continue to be a “positive agent of change in the criminal justice system”, \nbut he knows he cannot do so without DACA. The ability to achieve documented status through \nDACA is what gave him the confidence to go to law school in the first place, and make his family \nand community so proud. \nK.R.: A sister-turned-guardian putting food on the table. \nK.R. is a 30 year-old SEIU 521 member and shop steward who was brought to the \nUnited States from Mexico when she was five years old. During her 25 years of residence in \n1 0 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 24 PageID #: 6641\nCalifornia, she has attended school and college, worked in a community health center, and cared \nfor her three U.S. citizen siblings. \nDACA changed K.R.’s life. She was granted DACA status in 2013, and it came at a \ncrucial time in her life. K.R’s father had just passed away leaving her responsible for her three \nyounger siblings. Since K.R.’s mother had left the family many years earlier, K.R. assumed sole \nresponsibility for her siblings upon her father’s death. \n“All of my siblings were in high school or middle school at the time of my father’s passing.  \nI had to pay the rent and make certain there was food on the table. I had to attend parent-\nteacher conferences and make sure my teenage brothers were staying school and being good kids. \nHaving DACA made my life better in so many ways. It meant that I could get a job to pay for \nmy siblings’ needs. It also allowed me to have a job that paid for my brother’s tuition at \nSacramento State University. I’m so grateful to have DACA.” \nK.R.’s career goal was to become a lawyer and she attended college for two years, \nmajoring in criminal justice. Unable to afford tuition, she now works as a patient appointment \ncoordinator  at  a  community  health  clinic.  She  assists  low-income  patients  and  helps  them \nmanage the appointments they need for complex heart, diabetes and other health conditions.  \nSome of the patients K.R. works with have never seen a doctor before, and K.R. helps them \narrange services including medical and dental referrals and taxi vouchers. “I’m a good listener \nand I reassure patients so they will feel safe.”  \nK.R. is committed to working for the benefit of others. “It’s important to me to care for \nothers and make sure that we all work together.” \nE.M.: The father supporting his family and planning for college.  \nE.M. is a 31-year-old member of SEIU 32BJ who has lived in Washington, D.C. since he \ncame to the United States from Mexico in 1999.

He wanted to go to college but without immigration status, it didn’t \nseem possible.  \nA grant of DACA gave him hope. With DACA he has been able to “step out of the \nshadows,” participate in the community, and not be afraid of arrest and deportation. “I can’t \nstand the thought of being deported and leaving my kids alone.” \nDACA also inspired E.M. to consider once again taking college courses so that he could \nmove into a better job and then afford better housing. “I want to be able to afford a house so that \nmy kids can play in our own backyard.”  E.M’s kids are the world to him. “I want my kids to \ngrow up to be someone—I want them to go to college, have a good future and be better than I \nam. My seven-year-old son says he wants to be a doctor and he wants to buy me a big house. My \nkids are my motivation, they are my anchor, and they keep me fighting for a better future.” \nThe growth of gangs and cartels has increased dramatically since E.M. left his hometown \nof Puebla, Mexico in 1999. E.M.’s sister, his only close family member still in Mexico, warned \nhim “don’t you ever come back here, it’s too dangerous.”  \nAfter 18 years of living in the U.S. and contributing to his community through his work \nand union activities, E.M. believes that everything valuable to his life is in the U.S. “I’m not here \nto hurt anyone—I’m here to work hard and make a better life for me and my family—I don’t \nwant to go back to living in the shadows.” \n   \n1 2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 24 PageID #: 6643\nO.S.: 21 and “able to do normal things” like attend college. \nO.S. is a 21-year old citizen of Colombia, the nephew of a SEIU 1199 member, and a \nformer DACA beneficiary who is now a legal resident of the United States. He resides in Queens, \nNew York with his U.S. citizen wife, his brother, mother and grandmother.  \nO.S. has lived in New York City since he arrived in the United States with his family at \nage 8, more than 13 years ago. He always knew that he was undocumented, and as soon as the \nDACA program was created, O.S. applied and was granted DACA status. “Having DACA \nmeant that I was able to do normal things that other people my age were doing. I was a \nsophomore in high school and with DACA, I qualified to get my first job through the city \nSummer Youth Employment Program. DACA allowed me to feel more confident and more \ncomfortable. I didn’t feel ashamed and alien.” \nIn 2015, after O.S. graduated from high school in Queens, he enrolled in a bachelor’s \ndegree program at a campus of the City College of New York. In addition to his studies, O.S. \nworks  part-time  at  a  New  York  City  museum  and  part-time  at  a  pharmacy.  He  hopes  to \ncomplete his bachelor’s degree in 2 years and work in his field. \nO.S.  renewed  DACA  twice  and  remained  in  DACA  status  until  he  obtained  legal \nresidency last year through his marriage to a U.S. citizen. O.S.’s wife works with him at the \nmuseum and also attends a campus of the City College of New York. \n“Although I have a green card now, I’ll never forget how much it meant to me to receive \nDACA.

My own loving parents were so frightened that they might be deported leaving my \nbrother alone, that they gave up their parental rights in order to allow my U.S. citizen aunt to \nadopt us.

His favorite subject was math and he participated in the chess team in \nhigh school. At age 17, C.F. learned for the first time that he was undocumented when he sought \nto apply for a Social Security card.  \n“I felt like I was as American as anyone else and finding out that I was undocumented \nwas terrible for me. It changed my outlook and undermined my confidence.” C.S. felt that he \ndidn’t belong, that he was different, even in his own family. “I’m really close to my three U.S. \n1 6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 24 PageID #: 6647\ncitizen brothers. But finding out about my immigration situation made me feel like an outsider, \ndifferent and alone.” \nC.F. also worried that he couldn’t invest in his future, because as a person without \ndocuments, his future was uncertain. He feared he could be deported without warning. “My \nhopes for living the American dream—going to college, studying marketing, buying a home some \nday—the belief that I could succeed and a build a good life suddenly seemed impossible.” \nBut shortly after C.F. graduated high school, he heard about and applied for the DACA \nprogram. “DACA gave me permission to work, and with that permission I was able to get a \nsteady job and join the union. DACA gave me a chance and the hope for a better future.” With \nDACA,  C.F.’s  self-assurance  returned  and  he  began  participating  in  activities  to  help  his \ncommunity and in activities supporting his co-workers. “There are many people like me who just \nwant a chance to work hard and be part of the American dream. DACA gave me that chance.” \nV.S.: A+ student, psychology graduate, and caretaker of her American siblings.  \nV.S. was born in Mexico City and has resided in the United States since infancy. She is \nthe 23-year-old daughter of a SEIU 1021 member. Educated entirely in the United States, from \nelementary school through the university, she was granted DACA status in 2012. \n“DACA was a game changer for me. It gave me hope and allowed me to believe that I \nalways could be a little more. That I could graduate from the University of California, Santa \nCruz and be on the dean’s list, go to graduate school, and prepare for a career as an occupational \ntherapist. When my parents were forced to depart the U.S. a few months ago and I became the \nhead of my family, DACA kept my spirits up and helped me to trust that I would be able to \nsupport and care for my three younger U.S. citizen brother and sisters.” \nV.S. grew up with faith in the power of education and the value of community service. In \nhigh school she maintained a 4.0 average, organized a schoolwide activities committee, worked \n1 7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 22 of 24 PageID #: 6648\non the yearbook and volunteered at her at a nursing home, running activities, music lessons, \nexercise sessions and movie events for the elderly and fragile seniors. During her years at U.C. \nSanta Cruz, she studied psychology at the same time that she worked as a research assistant in a \nchild development lab, tutored over 40 students, and interned in a special program to advance \nand support diversity at the University. V.S. graduated in 2016 with a B.A. in psychology. \nV.S. plans to enter a master’s program and pursue a career in occupational therapy. “My \nmother is a nurse and I watched her care for her patients with compassion and diligence. She \ninspired me to become an occupational therapist and help patients overcome trauma. But until \nmy parents complete their immigration processing and are allowed to return to the U.S., I carry \nthe responsibility for my 12-year-old brother and my two U.S. citizen sisters, ages 16 and 21, on \nmy shoulders.  I have to make sure everything goes smoothly.” \nV.S. attends her brother and sister’s parent-teacher conferences and open house nights, \noversees their homework, and makes sure they get to school on time. She takes her brother and \nsister to the doctor, does the family grocery shopping and cooking, and handles the financial \nissues for her siblings and her parents. “We’re a close-knit family, and I can sense if my brother \nand sisters are upset. I know they’re going through a lot and I want to be there for them. Our \ncommunity, my mother’s union, and our church have been great to us.” \nV.S.’s 21-year-old sister is a senior at U.C. Santa Cruz but she comes home on the \nweekends. “I’m really close to my sister and I want to support her and help her as she faces her \nlast  year  of  college. She’s  a  human  bio  major  and  plans  to  go  to  med  school  and  be  a \npediatrician.” \n “I’ve always felt that I was an American,” she says. “But DACA has made me feel like \nmy dreams could come true and I could have a career that will allow me to give something back \nto my community and my country.” \n1 8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 158   Filed 12/22/17   Page 23 of 24 PageID #: 6649\nCONCLUSION \nThe plaintiffs’ request for declaratory and injunctive relief should be granted.  \n \n          Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Deepak Gupta     \nNicole G.

INTRODUCTION \nThe Government of the United Mexican States (“Mexico”) herein expresses significant \nconcern over the irreparable harm to its nationals, and the possible disruption that will occur to the \nextensive diplomatic and law enforcement collaborative relationship between the United States \nand Mexico, as a result of the rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”).1  \nMexico files the instant brief to underscore how the public interest and the U.S. Congress’s intent \nis best served by granting Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction.2   \nAs a  sovereign and independent State, Mexico has a legitimate interest in promoting the \nwell-being of its nationals who are residing in the U.S.—with over 11 million Mexican nationals, \nboth documented and undocumented, currently living in the United States.3  Nearly 79 percent of \nall  DACA  recipients—627,666  of  the  798,980  individuals  who  have  had  initial  DACA \napplications  approved—are  Mexican  nationals.4    Given  these  numbers,  DACA´s  rescission \ndisproportionately affects Mexican beneficiaries and Mexico is compelled to act on their behalf \nwithin all its means.  Mexico and the United States also engage in significant cooperation on issues \n                                                           \n1 See Red Earth LLC v. United States, 657 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2011) (setting forth the \nrequirement of demonstrating “irreparable harm absent injunctive relief” as a precondition to \nobtaining a preliminary injunction against government action).   \n2 See id. (establishing the requirement of demonstrating that “that the public’s interest weighs in \nfavor of granting an injunction.”). \n3  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  2015  American  Community  Surveys  (ACS), \nhttps://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/foreign-born/2014/cps2014/2014-year-\nof-entry-table2.17.xlsx (last visited Dec. 22, 2017); see also Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 64 \n(1941) (declaring that “[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all international relationships, \nrecognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, has to do with the protection of the \njust rights of a country’s own nationals when those nationals are in another country.”). \n4 See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Data Set: Form I-821D Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals, (Dec. 7, 2017) \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigrati\non%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performancedata_fy2017_qtr4.pdf \n(last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 10 of 29 PageID #: 6813\nof immigration, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and organized crime that will be adversely \naffected by DACA’s termination.5   \nEach nation, therefore, is strongly engaged in, and has a legitimate concern regarding, the \npolicies of the other in connection with immigration enforcement.  Mexico expressly and publicly \nacknowledges the sovereign right of every country to decide on the policies that should apply in \ntheir territory.  It also, however, respectfully asserts its legitimate, substantial, and compelling \ninterests to protect the rights of its nationals and to ensure that its diplomatic relations with the \nU.S. are not impacted by actions that may not comport with either U.S. law or international law.  \nII.  THE  RESCISSION  OF  DACA  WOULD  CAUSE  IRREPARABLE  HARM  TO \nMEXICAN NATIONALS THAT WAS NOT CONSIDERED BY DEFENDANTS \nWHEN RESCINDING DACA \n \n  Every DACA beneficiary has a compelling personal story and has become an important \npart of his/her community who is performing beneficial work for the U.S. while, at the same time, \nenhancing the development of commercial, economic, cultural, and scientific ties between Mexico \nand the United States.  As the New York Times recently explained, “a typical ‘Dreamer’ lives in \nLos Angeles, is from Mexico and came to the U.S. at 6 years old.”6  This brief begins by \nhighlighting the contributions of three DACA recipients to illustrate the type of irreparable harm \nthat will occur, and that Defendants failed to consider, when rescinding DACA.  \n  A.   Javier Alejandro Noris Guerrero \n  Javier Alejandro Noris Guerrero is a Mexican national who came with his parents to the \nUnited States through the southwest border without lawful immigration status when he was only \n                                                           \n5 Clare Ribando Seelke and Kristin Finklea, Cong.

So I ended up pursuing a career as a software \nengineer.”12 After working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, Javier moved to Brooklyn, \nNew York, where he works in venture capital, running a venture fund called ScienceVest that \ninvests in early-stage life science and frontier technology startups.13  These companies are working \non treatments for cancer and Alzheimer’s, as well as creating technologies such as artificial \nintelligence, robotics, and drones that could change these industries completely.14 \nAs a CEO of an investment fund, the repeal of DACA does not only affect Javier, it also \naffects the startups with which Javier works, as well as his ability to invest in them, and their ability \n                                                           \n7 Jonathan Inoa, He is an Executive, but His Future Depends Upon DACA, NY1 News (Mar. 8, \n2017), http://www.ny1noticias.com/nyc/noticias/noticias/2017/03/8/es-un-alto-ejecutivo-pero-su-\nfuturo-depende-de-daca- (last visited Dec. 22, 2017) \n8  Suzanne  Gamboa,  'Dreamers'  Fear  Trump  Immigration  Crackdown  As  DACA  Hits  5th \nAnniversary, NNC News (Jun.  15, 2017) https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/dreamers-fear-\ntrump-crackdown-daca-hits-5th-anniversary-n772451(last visited Dec. 22, 2017) \n9  FWD.US,  Glimpses  of  DACA:  In  their  Own  Words,  (Dec.  17,  2017) \nhttps://www.fwd.us/dacastories# (last visited Dec. 22, 2017) \n10 See Inoa, supra note 7.  \n11 See FWD.US, supra note 9. \n12 Id. \n13 Id.

Julio Ramos \nJulio Ramos is a Mexican national who came to the U.S. with his family and grew up in \nsouth Texas without lawful immigration status.30  At the age of 12, his mother was diagnosed with \nstage 3 breast cancer, and this experience motivated him to pursue a career as a doctor.31 For \nseveral years, he worked as a middle school biology teacher in Brownsville, Texas.32  Julio applied \nto medical schools in 2014 and 2016, and was accepted, but was unable to matriculate due to his \nundocumented status.33 Finally, in 2016, Julio was admitted into both the Stritch School of \nMedicine at Loyola University in Chicago and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in \nNew York City, two of the few medical schools in the nation that allow undocumented students \nwith DACA relief to attend.34 Julio now attends the Icahn School of Medicine, which awarded him \na combination of loans and scholarships to pay for his medical education.35  \nLike many DACA recipients, Julio’s unique background has allowed him to serve as a \ncultural bridge to improve relations between the United States and Mexico.  As Julio describes it, \n“[d]ue to my experiences, I am empathetic to the obstacles people face in accessing healthcare, \n                                                           \n30 New York Times Editorial Board, American Dreamers, New York Times (Jan. 3, 2017) \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/storywall/american-dreamers/stories/julio-ramos \n(last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n31 Id.  \n32 Reynaldo Leanos Jr., In the age of Trump, fewer lenders want to provide this med student with \nstudent loans, Public Radio International (May 17, 2017) https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-\n17/age-trump-fewer-lenders-want-provide-med-student-student-loans (last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n33 See New York Times Editorial Board, supra note 29. \n34 See Leanos Jr., supra note 28; Reynaldo Leanos Jr., Halfway through med school, undocumented \nstudents worry Trump will derail their progress, Public Radio International (Dec. 27, 2016) \nhttps://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-27/halfway-through-med-school-undocumented-students-\nworry-trump-will-derail-their (last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n35 Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 29 PageID #: 6818\nand this fuels my goal of providing care to those that are uninsured. I believe I can transform \ncommunities through medicine, but only if DACA continues.”36 \nDefendants’ rescission of DACA will irreparably harm Julio Ramos.  In addition to placing \nhim at imminent risk of removal, if Julio loses his employment authorization, it will become \nincredibly difficult, if not impossible, for him pay back the student loans he was already given to \nattend medical school.37 In addition, if Julio is not able to have work authorization by the time \nmedical school ends, it is unclear whether he would be allowed to join a residency program to \ncomplete his training.  Julio’s situation is not unique.  He is actually one of an estimated 70 DACA \nrecipients currently studying at medical schools in the United States.38  The rescission of DACA \nwould represent a significant loss of the educational resources that the United States has already \nexpended to train these talented future physicians to serve the American public. \nD.  Defendants’  DACA  Rescission  Memo  Irreparably  Harms  all  DACA \nRecipients by Exposing them to the Risk of Imminent Removal Regardless of \nthe Length of their Remaining DACA Approval Period \n  \n  Even if a substantial number of DACA recipients may not officially lose their DACA \nbenefits for several months or even longer, Defendants’ actions to terminate DACA have caused \na de facto instantaneous termination of DACA’s protections for all of its beneficiaries.  The \nprotections offered by DACA have now become illusory in a world where the overall program has \nbeen terminated and an increasing number of DACA beneficiaries are seeing their benefits revoked \nwithout due process based solely upon arrests that might occur for any reason whatsoever, \n                                                           \n36 See New York Times Editorial Board, supra note 29. \n37 Angilee Shah, Reynaldo Leanos Jr., et al., DACA recipients won’t go back into the shadows \nquietly, Public Radio International (Sep. 5, 2017) https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-08-30/daca-\nrecipients-won-t-go-back-shadows-quietly (last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n38 Mallika Kallingal and Michelle Krupa, She's undocumented and in med school.

And Defendants are actively promoting and encouraging more states \nand localities to pass laws such as SB 4.41  Defendants´ recent decisions and memoranda on \nimmigration enforcement  indicate that all undocumented individuals are  now  a priority  for \nremoval. With DACA’s rescission, the undocumented population has become a target for arrests \nand likely removal.  Mexico is therefore concerned that its nationals and individuals of Latino \nappearance will experience an enhanced risk of state-sanctioned acts of bias, discrimination, and \ndetention that did not exist prior to DACA’s rescission.  Arrests and detentions will likely arise \nbased on the mere appearance of the person that fits the typical profile of a DACA beneficiary42 \nwho encounters police, constituting a clear form of discrimination.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST WEIGHS STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF GRANTING \nPLAINTIFFS’  MOTIONS  FOR  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION  INSOFAR  AS \nDACA IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING CONGRESS’S INTENT IN ENACTING \nNAFTA AND MAINTAINING OPTIMAL FOREIGN RELATIONS BETWEEN \nMEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES   \n \nA.  Congress has Clearly Spoken and Expressed its Unambiguous Intent to Allow \nMexican  Nationals  with  the  Exact  Same  Education  and  Skills  as  DACA \nRecipients to Live, Study, and Work in the United States  \n \n  As indicated above, many DACA recipients (including all of the individuals discussed in \nthis brief) have received degrees from U.S. universities and are performing critical highly-skilled \ntasks as part of their employment.44  DACA has been enormously successful in encouraging what \nwas once the most vulnerable group of undocumented immigrants to fully participate and express \nthemselves within American society.  A critical point that is often overlooked in the DACA \ndiscussion is that, prior to the creation of DACA, Congress had already clearly and explicitly given \nits approval to providing any and all qualified Mexican nationals the ability to study at U.S. \nuniversities and to obtain highly-skilled employment in the U.S. without any caps or limitations \non the number of Mexican nationals studying or working in the United States.    \nAs an initial matter, Congress has explicitly stated in INA Section 101(a)(15)(F) that \nMexican nationals who are accepted at U.S. colleges and universities can obtain student visas to \nattend these schools.  Indeed, in FY 2015, 237,248 Mexican nationals were admitted into the U.S. \non student visas, and 96,401 Mexican nationals were admitted into the U.S. on F-3 nonimmigrant \n                                                           \n44 See Randy Capps, Michael fix, and Jie Zong, The Education and Work Profiles of the DACA \nPopulation, Migration Policy Institute (August 2017) at p. 6. http://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-\nsource/TrendTopic/Immigration/download.pdf?sfvrsn=0 \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 29 PageID #: 6821\nstatus, which allows Mexican nationals to continue to reside in Mexico while commuting to the \nU.S. to attend school. 45  \nMoreover, after a Mexican national successfully graduates from a U.S. university (or even \na university in Mexico), they are able to engage in highly skilled employment in the United States \nusing several visa categories, including the H-1B visa, the L-1 visa, and the optional practical \ntraining component of the student visa.46  And in addition to these visas that are available to foreign \nnationals from all over the world, Mexican nationals are given an additional visa that allows them \nto work in the U.S. under what is known as the TN nonimmigrant classification, which was created \nfollowing Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on \nDecember 8, 1993.47  There are no caps on the number of TN visas that can be issued,48 and \nMexican nationals can work on TN visas in three year increments and bring their spouses and \nchildren with them as well.49  There are currently sixty-three permissible occupations for TN visas \nthat are listed in Appendix 1603.D.1 to Annex 1603 of NAFTA.50  Consequently, for the large \npercentage  of  DACA  recipients  that  are  Mexican  nationals,  Congress  has  already  clearly \nenvisioned a scenario whereby those individuals could study, live, and work in the United States.   \n                                                           \n45  See  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Security,  U.S.  Nonimmigrant  Admissions,             \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/YRBK%202015%20NI%20Excel%20Supp\n%20Final_0.zip.  \n46 See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(L); and  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10) \n47 INA Section 214(e); 8 U.S.C. § 1184(e); see also U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nNAFTA Professional Workers from Canada or Mexico, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-\nnews/nafta-professional-workers-canada-or-mexico \n48 See id.

As stated above, Mexican \nnationals who are accepted at any U.S. college or university can readily obtain student visas to \nattend school in the United States.  A DACA recipient, however, is senselessly unable to fix their \nunauthorized status by obtaining a student visa to study at a U.S. university because the student \nvisa statute explicitly requires foreign nationals to have “a residence in a foreign country which he \nhas no intention of abandoning.”51 By definition, a DACA recipient cannot meet that statutory \ncriteria because the DACA memo stated that recipients must have “continuously resided in the \nUnited States” since June 15, 2007.52  Therefore, even though the Congress placed no cap on the \nnumber of Mexican nationals who can obtain student visas to attend U.S. universities, DACA \nrecipients are being punished and prevented from obtaining student visas solely because they were \nbrought to live in the United States through no fault of their own at a very young age.   \n  Similarly, any Mexican national with a college degree from either Mexico or the United \nStates can work in the United States on a TN-visa in one of sixty-three skilled occupations.  But \nagain, a DACA recipient, cannot obtain a TN-visa because they will be deemed inadmissible under \nSection 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as an alien who “has been unlawfully \npresent in the United States for one year or more.”53  By definition, any DACA recipient has to \nhave been physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012 and have had no lawful status \nat the time (hence making the universe of individuals with DACA status almost entirely populated \n                                                           \n51 See INA Section 101(a)(15)(F); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F). \n52 Mem. from Janet Napolitano, Sec’y of Homeland Security, to Alejandro Mayorkas, Dir., U.S. \nCitizenship  and  Immigration  Servs.,  Exercising  Prosecutorial  Discretion  With  Respect  to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children, June 15, 2012 \n53 See INA Section 212(a)(9)(B)(II); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(II). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 29 PageID #: 6823\nby people who are affected by what is known as the “10-year-bar” of inadmissibility).54  Therefore, \nthe only way a DACA recipient could ever obtain a TN-visa is to return to Mexico for 10 years \nand then apply for a TN-visa after the 10 years have elapsed (meaning that the individual would \nhave to voluntarily submit to a 10-year banishment to atone for the actions of their parents).55   \n  The purpose for creating the TN visa as part of NAFTA was to “reflect[] the preferential \ntrading relationship between the Parties.”56  NAFTA itself was designed to “strengthen the special \nbonds  of  friendship  and  cooperation,”  between  Mexico,  the  United  States,  and  Canada.57  \nSimilarly,  the  DACA  program  allows  young  and  talented  Mexican  nationals  to  serve  as \nspokespersons  and  ambassadors  for  mutual  understanding  between  the  U.S.  and  Mexico.  \nConsequently, preventing DACA recipients from engaging in the exact conduct that Congress \nspecifically authorized in the student visa, work visa, and TN visa statutes solely serves to unfairly \npenalize DACA recipients for the actions of their parents.   \nEven though Congress explicitly created programs for skilled Mexican nationals to be able \nto study at U.S. universities and work in the United States, Defendants’ actions are arbitrarily and \ncapriciously precluding DACA recipients from fulfilling Congress’s intentions.   This is contrary \nto the Supreme Court’s repeated pronouncement that “[V]isiting ... condemnation on the head of \nan infant is illogical and unjust. Moreover, imposing disabilities on the ... child is contrary to the \nbasic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual \n                                                           \n54 See Mem. from Janet Napolitano, supra note 60. \n55 The “10-year-bar” contained in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(II) of the INA is also another reason \nDACA recipients cannot obtain a student visa.  \n56 North American Free Trade Agreement, Article 1601, available at https://www.nafta-sec-\nalena.org/Home/Texts-of-the-Agreement/North-American-Free-Trade-\nAgreement?mvid=1&secid=8fd98e3e-4495-43a8-ba47-4a6955d6b5db#A1601  \n57  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement,  Preamble,  available  at  https://www.nafta-sec-\nalena.org/Home/Texts-of-the-Agreement/North-American-Free-Trade-\nAgreement?mvid=1&secid=b5b817ee-c48a-4dda-b8d9-c4564e34ac4b \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 29 PageID #: 6824\nresponsibility or wrongdoing.”58  The rescission of DACA also violates the Fifth Amendment’s \nequal protection clause because there is no rational basis for excluding DACA recipients from the \nimmigration outcomes available to similarly situated Mexican nationals.  And it is also a violation \nof DACA beneficiaries’ substantive due process rights to place their liberty at risk on the basis of \ntheir parents’ conduct.  Therefore, to the extent that most DACA recipients are Mexican nationals \nand that many DACA recipients are simply seeking to engage in occupations that are already \ncovered by the TN visa or other visa programs, the public interest favors granting Plaintiffs’ \nmotions for preliminary injunction because it simply places Plaintiffs in the same position that \nCongress had already contemplated they would be in but for their parents’ actions.  \nB.  Defendants’  DACA  Rescission  Memo  Harms  the  Public  Interest  by \nGenerating  Fear  and  Uncertainty  Amongst  DACA  Recipients  and  their \nFamilies, both in the United States and Mexico, and by Straining Mexico’s \nAvailable Consular Resources \n \nThe Government of Mexico has fifty consulates in the United States59 all charged with \nperforming duties such as helping Mexican citizens living or traveling in the U.S. who need \nassistance when dealing with U.S. laws and legal issues, or who need vital documents such as \npassports, identifications and birth certificates.60  Consular services include the following functions \ncontained in Article 5 of the Vienna Convention: (a) protecting the interests of Mexican nationals; \n(b) furthering the development of commercial, economic, cultural and scientific relations between \nMexico and the United States; (c) issuing passports and travel documents to Mexican nationals (d) \n                                                           \n58 Plyler v.

Consular officials also strengthen relations with local authorities, as well \nas business and community organizations in the region, and serve to promote Mexico as a country \nof economic, touristic, gastronomic, scientific, academic, cultural and artistic interest.  \n  Based on Mexico’s consultations with its consular officials stationed across the United \nStates and in New York, it is undeniable that Defendants’ DACA rescission memo is creating fear, \npanic, and uncertainty61 among Mexican nationals both nationwide and in New York regardless of \nimmigration status, as well as among Mexicans visiting the U.S. for both business and leisure \ntravel.62  This widespread concern is causing a disproportionate share of the time and resources of \nMexican consular officials to be focused on addressing the immigration enforcement concerns of \n                                                           \n61 See Mexican Embassy in Washington, Press Release Related to the announcement of the \ndecision of rescinding DACA, (Sept. 5, 2017) \nhttps://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/press-releases/press-releases-2017/1386-the-\ngovernment-of-mexico-deeply-regrets-the-cancellation-of-the-deferred-action-for-childhood-\narrivals-program-daca?platform=hootsuite (last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n62 National Public Radio, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of Latinos, (Oct. \n2017) “In contrast, the share of Mexicans who say they would work and live in the U.S. without \nauthorization has decreased from 20% two years ago to 13% now.

In addition, the Government of Mexico also operates the call center “Centro de \nInformación y Asistencia a Mexicanos” (hereinafter CIAM) to inform Mexican nationals about the \nprotection services provided by the Consulates along with other topics of interest concerning their \nrights in the United States.64  Beginning on September 5, 2017, the date of Defendants’ DACA \nrescission memo, CIAM has registered almost a 3000% increase in the number of calls from \nMexican nationals per month when compared to past months.65  This increase in calls is caused, \namong other issues, by the fear and uncertainty that Mexican nationals with DACA status have of \nbeing apprehended and removed.      \nBecause Mexico must expend significant consular resources to respond to the widespread \nfear and anxiety created by the rescission of DACA, the diplomatic relationship between Mexico \nand the U.S. is being improperly strained.  In weighing the public interest factors as required under \nWinter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), Mexico respectfully submits that the likely strain \ncaused to Mexican-U.S. relations by the rescission of DACA outweighs any harm that Defendants \nwould suffer if the preliminary injunction is granted.

Defendants’  DACA  Rescission  Memo  Harms  the  Public  Interest  by \nUndermining the Credibility of U.S. Promises to Foreign Nationals Regarding \nImmigration  which  Incentivizes  Undocumented  Immigration  and \nUnnecessarily Overwhelms all Available Mexican Immigration Enforcement \nResources  \n \n  When nearly 800,000 young adults applied for relief under DACA, they did so based on \nthe commitment given to them by the U.S.  government that their personal information would not \nbe used for immigration enforcement purposes.66  Now, the Trump Administration has stated that \nit  cannot  guarantee  that  DACA  application  information  will  not  be  used  for  immigration \nenforcement purposes.67  When the United States does not live up to its immigration commitments, \nthis undermines the credibility of the entire U.S. legal immigration system and encourages foreign \nnationals to enter the United States without authorization and remain in the shadows for fear that \ndisclosing their presence to immigration officials will only lead to imminent removal.  As a result \nof the U.S.’s failure to live up to its immigration commitments, Mexico is compelled to use its \nimmigration enforcement resources to manage transit flows of migrants who would otherwise have \nwaited at home and attempted to immigrate legally68, at the same time more Mexican nationals \ncould be removed after losing their deferred action.  This undermines the public interest by making \nit more difficult to combat undocumented immigration than would otherwise have been the case \nhad  the  DACA  memo  not  been  rescinded.    Therefore,  even  though  it  may  initially  seem \n                                                           \n66 See (Doc. 113-1) at pp. 28-33. \n67 Maryalice Parks, Geneva Sands, and Serena Marshall, Homeland security does little to ease \nnervous DACA recipients, ABC News (Sept. 28, 2017). http://abcnews.go.com/US/homeland-\nsecurity-ease-nervous-daca-recipients/story?id=50153287 (last visited Dec. 22, 2017). \n68 See Seelke and Finklea, supra note 4.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 29 PageID #: 6828\ncounterintuitive,  it  should  actually  come  as  no  surprise  that  unauthorized  immigration  has \nsignificantly increased since the date of Defendants’ DACA rescission announcement.69  \nD.

On October 11, 2017, the \nInter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) expressed its deep concern regarding the \ntermination of DACA based on the fact it will “jeopardize [DACA recipients’] ability in practice \nto ensure equal access to economic and social rights—including education, labor protections, and \nhealthcare—and legal guarantees, such as access to the courts.”70  The specific rights that the \nIACHR is most concerned about involve Articles II, XVII, and XXV of the American Declaration \nof the Rights and Duties of Man,71 as immigrant communities are reporting far fewer crimes due \nto fear that contact with police will lead to deportation.72   \n                                                           \n69  See  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  Southwest  Border  Migration  FY2018. \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration (stating that “CBP has seen an uptick \nin individuals month-to-month apprehended while trying to enter the country illegally in between \nthe established ports of entry . . .

In many \nfamilies, the DACA recipient is the main breadwinner and ending DACA causes entire families to \nsuffer, including mixed-status families that contain U.S. citizens in the household.74  \nThe ending of DACA is also in tension with Article 12 of the ICCPR, which declares that \n“no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country,” and Article 24 of the \nICCPR which states that “[e]very child has the right to acquire a nationality.”75 Many DACA \nrecipients pledge allegiance to the United States on a daily basis, are unable to recall any other \ncountry that they ever lived in, and are even unfamiliar with the language, culture, and institutions \nof their country of birth.  Many of these individuals lack a safety net in their country of birth \nbecause their presence was not registered there prior to their departure.

This regression of rights is a per se violation of their fundamental rights. \nWhen the United States does not act as the moral leader of the world in terms of living up \nto the highest ideals and spirit of its international commitments, it undermines its moral authority \nto persuade other countries to live up to their commitments.  Consequently, granting Plaintiffs’ \nmotions for preliminary injunction would serve the public interest by enabling the United States \nto restore its moral clarity regarding its treatment of its most vulnerable noncitizen population. \n  Granting Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction would also enhance the public \ninterest by enabling the Government of Mexico to promote cultural and educational ties with \nDACA recipients that enhance the relationship between Mexico and the United States.  Mexico \nactively engages in substantial cultural programming both in the U.S. and Mexico to promote \npositive dialogue between Mexicans and Americans.76  The rescission of DACA will frustrate the \nefforts of the Mexican Government to re-encounter and link with the young Mexican diaspora and \nto contribute to their full development for the benefit of both Mexican and American societies \ngiven that DACA recipients will no longer be able to freely live and work in the United States.  \nRestoring the DACA program will allow these young persons of Mexican heritage to serve as \ncultural ambassadors and to promote the values of diversity, tolerance, and cultural understanding \nthroughout the United States as Americans begin to see successful people in all fields and \noccupations from Mexico and other Latin American countries. \n \n \n                                                           \n76 See The U.S.- Mexico Foundation’s Dreamers Without Borders (DWB) program is the most \nprestigious binational educational and service program specially designed for young DACA \ndreamers https://www.usmexicofound.org/programs/daca-dreamers-delegations-to-mexico/ \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 28 of 29 PageID #: 6831\nCONCLUSION \nDue to irreparable harm that will be inflicted upon current DACA recipients and the \npossible disruption that might occur to the diplomatic relationship between the United States and \nMexico if DACA is rescinded, the Government of Mexico respectfully asks the Court to grant \nPlaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction and enjoin the termination of DACA pending further \nproceedings.  \n \nDated: December 22, 2017      Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Howard Sokol____________  /s/ Leon Fresco_____________ \nHOWARD SOKOL  LEON FRESCO \nHOLLAND & KNIGHT LLP  HOLLAND & KNIGHT LLP \n31 West 52nd Street, 12th Floor   801 17th Street, NW, Suite 110 \nNew York, NY 10019  Washington, DC 20006 \nTelephone: (212)513-3347  Telephone: (202)469-5129 \nEmail: howard.sokol@hklaw.com  Email: leon.fresco@hklaw.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae \nGovernment of the United Mexican States \n   \n \n      \n   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 168   Filed 12/22/17   Page 29 of 29 PageID #: 6832\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that, on December 22, 2017, I electronically filed a copy of the foregoing \nBrief Amici Curiae using the CM/ECF System for the United States District Court of Appeals for \nthe Eastern District of New York, which will send notification of that filing to all counsel of record \nin this litigation. \n \nDated: December 22, 2017  \n/s/Howard Sokol       \nHoward Sokol \n \nAttorney of Record for Amicus Curiae the \nGovernment of the United Mexican States \n                                                    \n \n21 \n ",

Many of amici’s \nclients are youth who were eligible for the recently rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (“DACA”) program.  Amici provide legal counseling to these youth to guide them \nthrough the intricacies of the immigration system.  As a result of their interaction with \nundocumented immigrants generally and DACA-eligible individuals in particular, amici \nunderstand the complex legal challenges now facing DACA grantees in light of the rescission of \nDACA and have observed the negative effects on their clients.3  They are well-positioned to \narticulate the nature of the irreparable harm at issue and the reasons an injunction serves the \npublic interest.4   \n                                                      \n1 The Court has granted amici’s motion for leave to file this brief.

This issue is addressed in an amicus brief to be filed by another set of amici.  See Mot. for Leave to File \nAmicus Br., Dkt. 176 in 16-CV-4756 and Dkt. 147in 17-CV-5228. \n4 Counsel for amici have interviewed and received information from the legal services organizations that are filing \n1 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 8 of 25 PageID #: 6664\n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe rescission of the DACA program announced by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) on September 5, 20175 causes real and imminent harm to young people who \nwere eligible for protection from deportation under DACA.  More than half of these DACA-\neligible individuals were six years old or younger when they first came to the United States; all \nwere younger than sixteen years old.  Results from Tom K. Wong et al., 2017 National DACA \nStudy, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS at 9 (Aug. 28, 2017) (“2017 National DACA Study”).6  \nThese young people now face a frightening and uncertain future in the United States, despite \nprior assurances by the government that by coming forward and applying for DACA, they would \nbe protected from negative immigration enforcement action. \nThe vast majority of DACA grantees will be left without any protection from deportation \n \nwhen their current status expires.  DACA grantees will also lose work authorization, leading \nthem to lose their jobs, health insurance, and countless other benefits.  Losing DACA will force \nmany of them into a life of hiding and constant fear of removal from the only country they have \never known.   \nThe decision to rescind DACA has intensified fear of accessing vital services in the \nimmigrant community.  As their DACA status expires, DACA recipients will join the ranks of \nimmigrants who have no protection against deportation and are afraid that if they go to school or \nwork, access medical services, or report a crime, they will become targets for deportation.  This \nfear is not only harmful to those directly affected but also dangerous for public health and safety.   \n                                                      \nthis brief.  Information throughout the brief that relates to these organizations’ clients was obtained through these \ninterviews and related requests for information.   \n5 Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C.

THE RESCISSION OF DACA CAUSES SIGNIFICANT HARM TO AMICI’S DACA CLIENTS, \nMOST OF WHOM HAVE NO VIABLE OPTION TO OBTAIN LEGAL IMMIGRATION STATUS \nAND AVOID DEPORTATION. \nThe rescission of DACA will put DACA recipients at risk for deportation and strip them \nof their eligibility for work permits.  Without DACA, most DACA recipients are ineligible for \nany protection from deportation under current law.  Indeed, DACA was only necessary because \nCongress failed to pass the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (“DREAM \n \nAct”),7 which would have created a path to citizenship for many DACA-eligible individuals, \ncommonly referred to as “Dreamers.”  The DREAM Act’s proponents sought to provide a much-\nneeded legal solution for undocumented young people who had been present in the United States \nfrom childhood, and, in some cases were not aware until adulthood of their lack of status.  \nProponents recognized that Dreamers grew up in the U.S. but had no other option for staying \nlegally in the United States.  Report and analysis of immigration and nationality law, 2. Senate \nJudiciary Subcommittee Holds Hearing on the DREAM Act, 88 No. 25 Interpreter Releases \n1594 (July 4, 2011).  Congress attempted (but failed) to pass legislation (including the DREAM \nAct) protecting this class of young immigrants approximately fourteen times since 2001, both as \nstand-alone legislation and as part of comprehensive immigration reform.8   \n                                                      \n7 H.R. 1842, 112th Cong.

See Memorandum \nfrom Secretary Janet Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, 2012).9  DACA granted a \nrenewable two-year period of deferred action (protection from deportation) and work \nauthorization.  Id.  Although DACA does not offer a path to legal status or citizenship, “it \nprovides tangible opportunities for young immigrants to participate more fully in our society and \neconomy.”  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA):  Funding Opportunities for \nPhilanthropy, Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees (Oct. 29, 2017).10  The \nDACA program allowed recipients to live without fear of deportation and to overcome many of \nthe hardships associated with undocumented status.  \n \nWhen their current period of deferred action expires, DACA recipients will be cast back \ninto legal uncertainty, without any protection from deportation.  Their loss is substantial and the \nconsequences are dire:  they will lose the ability to remain legally in the U.S. and will have no \nmeans of earning a living.  Most DACA recipients do not qualify for any form of immigration \nrelief, such as humanitarian-based forms of relief or family-based visas.  And for the few who \nmay qualify for other relief, successfully obtaining relief is nearly impossible under current \nimmigration law.  Thus, for the vast majority of DACA grantees, there is no other option and \nthey will become undocumented when their deferred status expires.   \n                                                      \n9 Available at https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-\nus-as-children.pdf. \n10 Available at \nhttps://www.gcir.org/sites/default/files/resources/GCIR%20DACA%20Funding%20Opportunities_1.pdf. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 11 of 25 PageID #: 6667\n \nA.  Most DACA Recipients Are Not Eligible for Humanitarian or Family-Based \nForms of Immigration Relief.   \nVery few DACA recipients are eligible for immigration relief under current law.  Amici \nroutinely screened DACA-eligible individuals for humanitarian and family-based forms of relief \nbefore providing assistance applying for DACA,11 but most DACA recipients had not suffered \nthe requisite trauma to qualify for humanitarian forms of relief, and did not qualify for family-\nbased relief.12  The majority of DACA recipients do not qualify for other immigration options, \nsuch as student or work visas, either.  Indeed, a 2014 study found that only 14.3% of DACA-\neligible young people potentially qualified for any other form of relief.  Tom K. Wong, et al., \nPaths to Lawful Immigration Status: Results and Implications from the PERSON Survey, 2 J. OF \nMIGRATION AND HUMAN SECURITY 4, 287-304 (2014).  The rescission of DACA therefore leaves \n  the vast majority of DACA recipients without any protection from deportation.  \nHumanitarian-based options are narrowly tailored forms of relief that typically require \nthat applicants suffered significant trauma in their country of origin or in the U.S.  For example, \nasylum and its related forms of relief require that applicants suffered or will suffer extreme harm \nin their countries of origin.13  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); INA § 101(a)(42)(A).14  Similarly, Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) confers status on young immigrants who have been abused, \nabandoned or neglected.  INA § 101(a)(27); 8 C.F.R. § 204.11.  “U” and “T” visas provide relief \n                                                      \n11 Ruling out other forms of relief was a crucial part of the DACA application process, as many other forms of relief, \nunlike DACA, confer a path to legal permanent residence and citizenship.   \n12 To qualify for family-based relief, applicants must be an immediate relative, defined as a spouse, unmarried child \nunder 21, or a parent (if the child is 21 years or older) of a U.S. citizen.  INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i).  Older and married \nchildren of U.S. citizens and spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents are also eligible for \nvisas, but are subject to numerical limitations each year.  INA § 203. \n13 Asylum applicants often seek withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture as well.  \nINA § 241(b)(3); Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \n1465 United Nations Treaty Series at 85 (Dec. 10, 1984), \nhttps://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-9&chapter=4&lang=en. \n14 The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) is comprised of a series of sections of Title 8 of the United States \nCode (“USC”).  Hereinafter, federal immigration statutes are only referenced to their INA classification. \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 12 of 25 PageID #: 6668\n \nfor victims of certain qualifying crimes and human trafficking, respectively, while the Violence \nAgainst Women Act (“VAWA”) allows certain battered spouses, children, and parents to petition \nfor legal status without the involvement of their abusive spouse, parent, or child.  INA § \n101(a)(15)(U) (U Visas); INA § 101(a)(15)(T) (T visas); INA § 245 (VAWA).15  But individuals \nwho spent most of their lives in the United States and have not experienced significant harm or \nviolence in their lives simply do not qualify for these forms of relief.   \nMost DACA grantees are not eligible for family-based immigration relief because they \ndo not have a qualifying relative.  Among the few DACA recipients who do have a qualifying \nrelative, many are not eligible to apply to adjust status from within the country because they last \nentered the country without permission.16  As a result, these DACA recipients would have to \nleave the country to apply for a family-based visa, and then would face strict bars to re-entry, due \n \nto their previous “unlawful presence” in the United States.17  INA § 212(a)(9)(B)-(C).  \nUndocumented immigrants who have accrued unlawful presence are barred from re-entry for \nthree years, ten years, or permanently, depending on their length of unlawful presence and \nnumber of entries.  INA §§ 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I)-(II) and 212(a)(9)(C).  Those who entered the \n                                                      \n15 Even in the rare situation that a DACA-eligible individual qualifies for an alternative form of relief, the waiting \ntime for that relief can be many years.  For example, the current waiting time for a U visa is approximately five to \nten years.  Even an interim work permit through a U visa application currently takes about three years to process, \nand individuals waiting for U visa approval have been subjected to enforcement by Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) during this waiting period.  Amici and others report that U visa applicants have been detained \nin recent months despite having a pending U visa applications.

Seventy-eight percent of DACA recipients are from Mexico.  \nThe government is currently processing visa petitions filed in March 1996 for unmarried Mexican sons and \ndaughters of U.S. citizens.  Visa Bulletin for October 2017, U.S. Dep’t of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (Sept. \n11, 2017), https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/bulletin/2018/visa-bulletin-for-october-2017.html. \n17 “Unlawful presence” is when an undocumented immigrant “is present in the United States after the expiration of \nthe period of stay authorized . . . or is present within the United States without being admitted or paroled.”  INA § \n212(a)(9)(B)(ii).   \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 25 PageID #: 6669\n \ncountry more than once without inspection and have been unlawfully present for a total of more \nthan one year are permanently barred.  INA § 212(a)(9)(C).   \nDACA recipients do not continue to accrue “unlawful presence” once their DACA \napplication is approved—but, once their DACA status expires, they will again accrue unlawful \npresence.  See United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, DACA Frequently Asked \nQuestions (“USCIS DACA FAQs”), Question 1.  Most DACA recipients have already accrued \nsome unlawful presence and are subject to time bars.  Accrual of “unlawful presence” for the \npurpose of the three and ten year bars begins once an undocumented immigrant turns 18.  INA \n§§ 212(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I).  Therefore, DACA recipients would have accrued “unlawful presence” \nbetween the time they turned 18 and the date they received protection from deportation, i.e., the \ndate their DACA application was approved.  Because the average age of a DACA grantee in \n \n2017 is 25 years old, and DACA was implemented in 2012, an average DACA grantee who \napplied for DACA as soon as it was available was 20 years old at the time of application and \nthus would have accrued two years of unlawful presence (from the time they were 18 in 2010 \nuntil they received the DACA grant in 2012).  See 2017 National DACA Study at 13.  This would \nresult in a ten-year bar to re-entering the United States.  INA §§ 212(a)(9)(B)(iii)(II).  Even the \nthree and ten year bars, in practice, are complete barriers to relief, because applicants would need \nto leave their families, jobs, schools, and for most, the only country they have ever known, in \norder to wait out the time-bar.  The standards for obtaining a waiver of unlawful presence are so \ndifficult to meet that even for the very few DACA recipients who might qualify for family-based \nadjustment of status, it is an illusory form of relief at best.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 14 of 25 PageID #: 6670\n \nB.  DACA Recipients Are Not Eligible for Relief Based on Their Length of Time \nin the U.S., No Matter How Well-Spent.  \nContrary to popular perception, there is no form of relief available to young immigrants \non the basis that they have lived in the United States for most of their lives, even if they have \nbeen exemplary members of the community and excelled academically.  DACA also did not \ncreate a “loophole” by which eligible young people could “cut in line” for relief for which they \nwould have had to wait longer if they had stayed in their home countries.  Rather, DACA \nprovided young people who were already here and had no viable recourse for immigration relief \nwith temporary work permits and protection from deportation.   \nPrior to immigration reform in 1996, immigrants in deportation proceedings could ask an \nimmigration judge to grant “suspension of deportation,” which took the “good moral character” \n  of an immigrant into account.18  This form of relief was only available if an immigrant was in \nremoval proceedings and would either endure extreme hardship if deported or had a U.S. citizen \nor a lawful permanent resident (“LPR”) family member who would endure extreme hardship if \nthe applicant were deported.  In 1996, Congress eliminated “suspension of deportation,” and \nreplaced it with a form of cancellation of removal that removed consideration of hardship to the \napplicant and imposed a higher burden on the applicant to show hardship to a U.S. citizen or \nLPR family member.19  INA § 240A(b); see Hernandez v. Gonzalez, 437 F.3d 341, 346-47 (3d \n                                                      \n18 “Suspension of deportation” required:  (1) continuous physical presence in the U.S. for at least seven years; (2) \ngood moral character during those seven years; and (3) that deportation would result in extreme hardship to the \napplicant or the applicant’s citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent, or child.  INA § 244(a) (1994) \n(repealed 1996).   \n19 Most applicants are unable to avoid deportation through cancellation of removal unless they can show that \ndeportation would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent or \nchild.  INA § 240A.  This standard is a very demanding one that generally requires a showing that a U.S. citizen or \nLPR family member suffers from a severe chronic medical condition and requires special medical attention and \nfinancial support.  See Ayeni v. Holder, 617 F.3d 67, 67, 73 (1st Cir. 2010) (upholding lower court decision that even \nevidence of petitioner’s inability to provide medical care for his children’s chronic and serious health issues, which \nincluded severe asthma, migraine headaches, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, did not meet hardship \nstandard).  Demonstrating that emotional harm will be caused by the separation of family members or financial \nhardship is insufficient.  Tejado v. Holder, 776 F.3d 965, 969 (8th Cir. 2015) (emotional harm); Gomez-Perez v. \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 25 PageID #: 6671\n \nCir. 2006) (noting the “practical effect . . . [is] that a far larger number of immigrants are now \nremovable under the new law, while a much smaller number are eligible for any form of relief \nfrom removal”).  As with “suspension of deportation,” only immigrants in removal proceedings \nand with a qualifying relative (hardship to the applicant is no longer sufficient) are able to seek \ncancellation of removal.  Given that most DACA recipients do not have a qualifying relative at \nall (Wong, Paths to Lawful Immigration Status), no less a qualifying relative who would endure \nextreme hardship, this option is inapplicable to most DACA recipients.  \nAs a result, for the vast majority of DACA recipients who do not qualify for humanitarian \nor family-based immigration relief, there is no procedure, other than DACA, to protect them \nfrom deportation. \nC.  Without DACA, Most DACA Recipients Will Become Undocumented and \n  Suffer Significant Related Harms. \nGiven the small number of DACA recipients who actually qualify for immigration relief \nand the legal hurdles faced by the small minority of those that do qualify, the reality is that most \nDACA recipients will become undocumented as a result of the Rescission Memorandum.  They \nwill not be able to work legally and will not have any protection from deportation—and will \nsuffer numerous harms as a result.  The elimination of DACA “reverberate[s] far beyond th[e] \nprivileges” of legally living and working in the United States.  Caitlin Dickerson, For DACA \nRecipients, Losing Protection and Work Permits Is Just the Start, The New York Times (Sept. 7, \n2017) (“Losing Protection”).20   \nThe positive impact of the DACA program—both to its recipients and to American \nsociety more generally—should not be underestimated.  “Since DACA began, thousands of \n                                                      \nHolder, 569 F.3d 370, 373 (8th Cir. 2009) (financial hardship).   \n20 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/daca-losses-immigration.html. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 16 of 25 PageID #: 6672\n \nDreamers have been able to enroll in colleges and universities, complete their education, start \nbusinesses that help improve our economy, and give back to our communities as teachers, \nmedical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs—all on the books.”  Letter from Secretary \nJeh Johnson, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., to Honorable Judy Chu, U.S. House of Rep. (Dec. \n30, 2016).21  After the implementation of DACA, approximately 80% of DACA grantees \nobtained driver’s licenses for the first time.  2017 National DACA Study at 9.  Many also \nobtained financial aid for higher education.  See Dickerson, Losing Protection.  Further, after \nreceiving DACA, approximately 65% of DACA grantees age 25 and under and approximately \n54% of DACA grantees over age 25 pursued educational opportunities they previously could not \npursue.  2017 National DACA Study at 7.  Approximately 70% of DACA recipients “earn[ed] \nmore money, which . . . helped [them] become financially independent.”  Id. at 3.  As the result \n \nof their employment, many DACA recipients also obtained employer-based health insurance.22  \nSee Jessica Ferger, Rescinding DACA Could Spur a Public Health Crisis, from Lost Services to \nHigher Rates of Depression, Substance Abuse, Newsweek (Sept. 6, 2017).23  These benefits that \nDACA recipients have relied on, benefits that many U.S. citizens “take for granted and cannot \neven imagine living without,” will disappear with the rescission of DACA.  Dickerson, Losing \nProtection.  For DACA recipients, this will result in undeniable harm as it will mean an inability \n                                                      \n21 Available at \nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response%20to%20Chu%2012.30.16.p\ndf. \n22 Rescinding DACA will also have a significant economic effect, as employers will have to terminate the employment \nof DACA grantees once their deferred status expires. This will result in a reduction in contributions made to Social \nSecurity and Medicare, both by the employee and employer, of approximately $39.3 billion over 10 years.

DACA recipients who are \nparents must choose whether to take their U.S. citizen children with them if they are deported, or \nface long-term and possibly permanent separation.  Priscilla Alvarez, Will DACA Parents Be \nForced to Leave Their U.S.-Citizen Children Behind?, The Atlantic (Oct. 21, 2017) (because of \nthe rescission of DACA, an estimated 200,000 children are now at risk of losing their DACA \nrecipient parents).24  If they decide to leave their U.S. citizen children in the U.S., they need to \nmake legal, practical, and financial arrangements for the care of their children.  DACA recipients \nwho may be subject to deportation must also spend time and resources to protect their property, \n \nassets, and finances in case they are deported.  These harms are not speculative.  A recent study \nprofiled a DACA recipient who “was born in Mexico, but came to the U.S. at the age of nine.  \nShe received DACA when she was studying for a master’s degree at Stanford.  She bought a \nhouse, married another DACA recipient, and has two children who are U.S. citizens.”  Julia \nCarrie Wong, Fear and uncertainty for Dreamers as DACA ends: “Where am I going to go?,” \nThe Guardian (Sept. 5, 2017).25  This DACA recipient is not eligible for immigration relief, so \nshe and her partner are having to consider options “to protect [their] daughters in case [they] are \ndeported.”  Id. at 2.  Amici are aware of countless similar situations among their clients, which \ncause a significant amount of stress and anxiety.   \n                                                      \n24 Available at https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/donald-trump-daca/543519/. \n25 Available at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/05/dreamers-daca-trump-ends-program-fears-for-\nfuture \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 25 PageID #: 6674\n \nThe rescission of DACA creates significant turmoil for DACA recipients and their \nfamilies, who have planned their futures around the promises of DACA.  Now, most will once \nagain become undocumented immigrants, with all the uncertainty and anxiety that entails, and \nwithout the ability to work legally, obtain health insurance, legally drive in many states, pay for \ncollege, purchase homes, and make plans for their lives.26    \nII.  THE RESCISSION OF DACA CAUSES FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT ACCESSING \nPUBLIC SERVICES, WHICH HARMS THE PUBLIC INTEREST. \nIn light of a political climate increasingly hostile to immigrants, intensified by the \nrescission of DACA, many in the immigrant community are understandably fearful of \ndeportation and afraid to access services.  When DACA protections expire, amici’s DACA \nclients will no longer be protected from deportation and, like other undocumented immigrants, \n  may be afraid to access services.  This situation endangers public health and safety.  \nA.  DACA Recipients and Other Immigrants Are Afraid to Access Health and \nOther Social Services, and to Attend School, Out of Fear of Deportation. \nIn the wake of recent increasing immigration enforcement activity and the Rescission \nMemorandum, there is evidence that anxiety is causing undocumented immigrants, including \nDACA recipients, to avoid utilizing health services and refrain from reporting crimes.  Some \nmembers of the immigrant community are even avoiding school and work.  For example, amicus \norganization Centro Legal de la Raza has a client whose family members stopped working \n                                                      \n26 DACA recipients are at even more risk than other undocumented immigrants because they provided personal and \nsensitive information to the government as part of the DACA application process, including addresses, employers, \nphotos, and fingerprints.  Now, the government has stated that although the personal information will not be \n“proactively provided” to other law enforcement entities and ICE, that may change and be “rescinded at any time \nwithout notice.” See USCIS DACA FAQs at Question 8; Richard Gonzales, DACA Recipients Worry What The \nGovernment Will Do With Their Private Information, NPR (Sept. 9, 2017), \nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/09/09/549678003/daca-recipients-worry-what-the-government-will-do-with-their-private-\ninformation.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 25 PageID #: 6675\n \nbecause of fear of workplace raids.  Several amici organizations have been providing “Know \nYour Rights” presentations in order to alleviate these concerns in the community. \nMany undocumented immigrants avoid visiting hospitals or clinics for fear of \ndeportation.   See Anna North, DACA helped some immigrants finally get health care.  Now they \ncould lose it, Vox (Sept. 28, 2017) (“DACA helped get health care”).27  For example, \nundocumented immigrant women may not access necessary prenatal health care, which can lead \nto a wide range of detrimental health outcomes.  North, DACA helped get health care.  \nAnecdotal evidence demonstrates that avoidance behavior, motivated by fear, abounds.  As one \nnon-profit organization observed, “[w]hat we’re finding and hearing from all over the country is \na huge concern about whether or not seeking routine care and preventative care as well as care \nfor their children, who may be documented, is going to put those families in jeopardy of \n \ndeportation . . . .  What we heard was a real significant uptick in no-show rates.”  Stephanie Kuo, \nUndocumented Immigrants Putting ‘Health On Hold’ Out Of Fear, Anxiety In Uncertain Times, \nHouston Public Media (Sept. 15, 2017).28  Indeed, fear of deportation is so strong that one \nundocumented immigrant woman stopped accessing and receiving cancer treatments because she \nwas terrified of being identified and detained if she continued using health services given reports \nof increased immigration enforcement.  Virginia Fay, Back Into the Shadows: Immigrants \nRetreat From Needed Services as Deportation Fears Loom, KQED News (June 15, 2017) (“Back \nInto the Shadows”).29  Amici have observed this phenomenon, as well.  Medical professionals \nhave informed amicus organization ILRC that undocumented immigrants treated in emergency \n                                                      \n27 Available at https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/28/16351866/daca-health-care-reproductive-health-\nundocumented-immigrants. \n28 Available at https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/09/15/237573/undocumented-immigrants-\nputting-health-on-hold-out-of-fear-anxiety-in-uncertain-times/. \n29 Available at https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/06/15/back-into-the-shadows-immigrants-retreat-from-needed-\nservices-as-deportation-fears-loom/. \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 25 PageID #: 6676\n \nrooms have failed to return to the hospital for critical follow-up treatment out of fear of \ndeportation.   \nUndocumented immigrants are also increasingly afraid to report crimes to law \nenforcement, fearing that any interaction with a governmental entity could lead to deportation.  \nPolice departments across the nation worry about how the increasingly fearful climate will affect \ntheir relationships with immigrant communities and their ability to solve crimes.  As one police \ncaptain explained, undocumented immigrants “will see law enforcement and the justice system \nas something that is now less accessible . . .  and potentially threatening . . . because they’re \nconcerned that the federal government will somehow get that information and use it to deport \nthem.”  Id.  Police in many major cities have observed significantly decreased reporting of sexual \nand domestic violence by Latina women during the first few months of 2017, compared to the \n \nsame time period in 2016.  Id. (sharp downturn in Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco); see \nalso Jennifer Medina, Too Scared to Report Sexual Abuse.  The Fear: Deportation, The New \nYork Times (Apr. 30, 2017) (sharp downturn in cities in Colorado and Maryland).30  Advocates \nreport that many domestic violence survivors who are undocumented are too afraid of contact \nwith police to seek life-saving restraining orders, report abuse, or seek U visas.  Fay, Back Into \nthe Shadows.  They further note that undocumented survivors are even afraid to stay at shelters.  \nId.  When “survivors do come in for help, they are often so scared that they won’t stay more than \na few days or a week.”  Id.  Amicus organizations report experiences with multiple clients who \nhave endured horrific domestic violence but are too afraid to report the abuse due to their \nimmigration status.  Some immigrants are even afraid to come to amici’s offices to be screened \nfor immigration relief, for fear of encountering ICE.   \n                                                      \n30 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/immigrants-deportation-sexual-abuse.html. \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 25 PageID #: 6677\n \nFear in the community has led to increased absenteeism among immigrant students in \nschools across the nation.

Some immigrant parents have even expressed fear of sending their children to school, \nin case “they’re taken in an ICE raid during the day and their children have no one to return \nhome to.”  Fay, Back Into the Shadows. \nImmigrant families are also reluctant to access social services due to fear of deportation.   \nSocial scientists have pointed out that “anti-immigrant sentiment and increased deportation \nactivity has had a long history of causing eligible families to drop out and shy away” from safety \nnet programs.  Annie Lowrey, Trump’s anti-immigrant policies are scaring families away from \nthe safety net, The Atlantic (Mar. 24, 2017) (“Trump’s anti-immigrant policies”).33  In many \n                                                      \n31 Available at http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/05/immigration-crackdown-taking-heavy-toll-on-california-\nstudents/?platform=hootsuite. \n32 Available at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/23/us-immigration-children-schools-trump. \n33 Available at https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/trump-safety-net-latino-\nfamilies/520779/?utm_source=nl-atlantic-weekly-032417. \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 22 of 25 PageID #: 6678\n \ncases, families eligible for these vital programs have mixed immigration status—for example, \n“undocumented parents with children with birthright citizenship.”34  Id.  Eligible mixed-status \nfamilies are declining to enroll in, or even un-enrolling from programs such as the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”)35 and Women, Infants, and Children (“WIC”), out of \nfear that enrollment will put undocumented family members at risk of deportation.36  Lowrey, \nTrump’s anti-immigrant policies.  Eligible families are withdrawing from other anti-poverty \nprograms as well.  Id.  For instance, Eisner Health, a health care provider, compared monthly \nenrollment averages from December 2016 through February 2017 with data from 2016, and \nreported a 20% drop in food stamp enrollment, a 54% drop in Medicaid enrollment among \nchildren, and an 82% drop in enrollment in a local health program.  Id.  Re-enrollment in these \nprograms has declined by 40%.  Id.  The community’s avoidance of these crucial services will \n \nlikely result in “long-term consequences on the health, nutrition, and school performance of the \nyoungest members of these families,” many of whom are U.S. citizens.  Id.   \nEven immigrants who have already received a form of relief from deportation, such as \nasylum, are experiencing an uptick in anxiety.  Several amici have received calls from asylees \nconcerned that the DACA rescission might result in the revocation of their asylum status or mean \nthat they should take further steps to protect themselves from deportation.  Other clients are \nafraid to apply affirmatively for any form of relief because they worry about what will happen if \nrelief is denied or later rescinded, like DACA.   \n                                                      \n34 Such mixed immigration family status families are increasingly common—nearly six million citizen children live \nin such households.  Id. \n35 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), United States Department of Agriculture: Food and Nutrition \nService (Jan. 30, 2017), https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap.  \n36 Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), United States Department of Agriculture:  Food and Nutrition Service (Aug. \n15, 2017), https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic. \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 23 of 25 PageID #: 6679\n \nDue to the rescission of DACA, many young people are now thrust into the precarious \nposition of considering whether accessing medical care, reporting crimes, going to school, or \nenrolling in social services could negatively affect their ability to remain in the United States.  \nAnd for the immigrant community at large, the rescission of DACA has only worsened anxiety, \nin an era already fraught with uncertainty and fear. \nB.  When Immigrants Are Afraid to Access Services, Public Health, Safety, and \nCommunity Economic Interests Are Negatively Impacted. \nWhen individuals are too scared to seek essential services for fear of deportation, the \nrisks for individual and public health safety increase significantly.  Indeed, the “administration’s \nactions and directives ostensibly target the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who live in the \nUnited States, but they will also harm millions of American citizens all across the country who \n  live and work beside these immigrants every day.”  Lowrey, Trump’s anti-immigrant policies \n(emphasis added).    \nConsiderable risks to individual and public health are associated with the community’s \nanxiety about accessing healthcare.  When individuals do not seek preventive care (including \nvaccines), fill vital prescriptions, or care for acute conditions until they experience an \nemergency, both the risk of public health crises and the price of health care can rise.  \n“Ultimately, keeping undocumented immigrants from getting necessary health care is bad for \neveryone. . . . Health care is more expensive when people can’t get it until they’re very sick.  \nAnd lack of health care increases the risk of chronic illness, which can make people unable to \nwork or be active in their communities.”  North, DACA helped get health care; see also Julianne \nZuber, Healthcare for the Undocumented: Solving a Public Health Crisis in the U.S., 28 J. \nCONTEMP. HEALTH L. & POLICY 350, 370 (2012) (“Placing barriers to accessing regular health \ncare for undocumented immigrants threaten[s] community resilience because those with pre-\n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 24 of 25 PageID #: 6680\n \nexisting health conditions are more vulnerable to . . . severe effects from a disease outbreak or \npublic health emergency.”).  Moreover, anxiety and fear of the consequences of being \nundocumented, including deportation and lack of future access to health care, could lead to acute \nmental health concerns.  See David Becerra, et al., Fear vs. Facts: Examining the Economic \nImpact of Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S., 39 J. SOC. & SOC. WELFARE 111, 118 (2012); \nLeisy J. Abrego, Legal Consciousness of Undocumented Latinos: Fear and Stigma as Barriers to \nClaims-Making for First- and 1.5-Generation Immigrants, 45 LAW & SOC'Y REV. 337, 370 \n(2011) (risk of permanent anxiety for undocumented immigrants).   \nThe public’s safety is also put at risk.  When victims of and witnesses to crime are afraid \nto approach law enforcement, crime goes underreported.  See Susana Martinez and Sheila \nNeville, Help for Undocumented Victims of Crime, 44 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 129, 141 (2010).  \n \nThe reluctance to report crime is dangerous not only to undocumented immigrant victims, but to \nsociety as a whole.  See Bill Ong Hing, Immigration Sanctuary Policies: Constitutional and \nRepresentative of Good Policing and Good Public Policy, 2 UC IRVINE L. REV. 247, 303 (2012) \n(noting that the entire community is safer when the immigrant community trusts law \nenforcement).  “When the community and law enforcement are not engaged, we miss \nopportunities to interrupt current and future violence.  As a result, everyone’s public safety is put \nat risk.”  Debra J. Robbin, When Undocumented Immigrants Don’t Report Crime, We All Suffer, \nWBUR (Sept. 22, 2017).37   \nThe decision to rescind DACA has increased fear in the immigrant community and added \nthousands of young people to the group of people afraid of deportation.  The resulting reduction \nin use of public health, safety, educational, and social services is harmful to the public interest. \n                                                      \n37 Available at http://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2017/09/22/undocumented-immigrants-report-crimes-debra-j-\nrobbin. \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 162   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 25 PageID #: 6681\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe rescission of DACA irreparably harms DACA recipients by depriving them of their \nonly real opportunity to pursue the American Dream.  It also instills a fear among DACA \nrecipients and all immigrants alike that is harmful to American society as a whole.  On behalf of \ntheir clients and the communities they serve, amici curiae urge this Court to issue a declaratory \njudgment that the Rescission Memorandum is unlawful and unconstitutional and to grant a \nnationwide injunction in order to prevent further harm and damage to the public interest.   \nDated:  December 22, 2017  By: /s/ Kara C.

DACA grantees \nwork in state and local government agencies, universities and hospitals, and in a diverse array of \nbusinesses and non-profit institutions. DACA grantees are integrated into our communities and \nboth the public and private sectors rely on their significant contributions.  \nYet  when  DHS  and  DOJ  decided  to  end  DACA,  they  disregarded  the  harm  the \ntermination will inflict on DACA grantees as well as on the state and local institutions and \nprivate companies that count on them. Instead, DHS and DOJ cited two unsubstantiated reasons \nfor  the  termination—the  likelihood  of  successful  litigation  against  the  United  States  if \nDefendants continued the program, and that DACA itself was unconstitutional and unlawful. \nEvidence in the record reveals the stated bases to be pretextual. Specifically, statements and \nactions demonstrate that Defendants’ termination of DACA was motivated, at least in part, by \nanimus against Latinos. \nDefendants have repeatedly asserted to this Court and others that they have unfettered \nauthority  to  terminate  DACA—whenever  they  want,  however  they  want,  and  for  whatever \nreason  they  want.1  This  assertion  is  simply  not  true.  While  Congress  has  delegated  wide \ndiscretion to the Executive Branch in the area of immigration enforcement, the U.S. Constitution \n                                                 \n1 See Mem. of Law in Supp. of Defs.’ Mtn. to Dismiss at 12-19, ECF. 71-1; Defs’ Mtn. to Vacate at 5-6, ECF. 48. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 10 of 48 PageID #: 3894\n \nplaces important limits on the exercise of such discretion. Similarly, Congress has enacted laws \nto ensure that the Executive does not exercise its discretion in an arbitrary and capricious \nmanner, and that the Executive hears from diverse interests and considers potential consequences \nbefore it takes action. Plaintiff States (herein, “Plaintiff States” or “States”) accordingly filed this \nsuit to prevent Defendants from sidestepping these key restraints on their authority and from \ncausing great harm to the States and their residents.  \nNow Plaintiff States bring this motion requesting that the Court preliminarily enjoin the \ntermination of DACA. Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the \ntermination  was  arbitrary  and  capricious  and  an  abuse  of  discretion,  in  violation  of  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Defendants did not offer reasoned, \nevidence-based rationales for the termination; failed to analyze all relevant issues and factors, \nincluding the significant reliance interests created by DACA; and Defendants’ stated reasons for \nthe termination were pretextual as the decision to terminate DACA was animus-driven.  \nThat animus towards Latinos motivated the decision to terminate DACA, and the stated \nirrational reasons for the action, demonstrate that Defendants also violated the equal protection \nguarantee of the U.S. Constitution. Animus-driven decisionmaking cannot withstand even the \nmost deferential form of Equal Protection. Indeed, given the breadth and abruptness of the \ntermination, its lack of evidentiary support, and its unprecedented departure from deferred action \nnorms, the termination decision “seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it \naffects.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). Thus, Plaintiff States are likely to succeed \non their equal protection claim. \n Plaintiff States are also likely to succeed on their claim that Defendants violated the \nprocedural  requirements  of  the  APA  and  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  (“RFA”),  because \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 11 of 48 PageID #: 3895\n \nDefendants failed to provide for notice and comment on the termination and failed to consider \nthe impact on numerous local governments and small businesses throughout the country. The \ntermination is a legislative rule that affects substantial rights and interests and binds discretion of \nDHS officials. Moreover, the strong public interest in the termination makes it just the type of \nrule for which notice and comment is meant to apply.     \nIn terminating DACA—when they did, in the manner they did, and for the reasons they \ndid—Defendants have attempted to evade critical safeguards against the unconstitutional and \nunlawful exercise of their power. Left unchecked, Defendants actions will cause irreparable and \ngrave harm to Plaintiff States and their residents. By contrast, Defendants will not be harmed by \na preliminary injunction. The balance of the equities therefore supports such preliminary relief. \nPreliminary relief will ensure that Defendants are not allowed to elude legal provisions designed \nto prevent abuses of power and to protect the well-being of the American public.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA party “seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits; that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor; and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. \nNat’l Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 12 of 48 PageID #: 3896\n \nARGUMENT \nPLAINTIFF STATES ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nCLAIMS \n \n  Defendants’ Termination of DACA was Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of \nthe APA.  \n \nUnder the APA, agency action is unlawful if it is found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2).2 To determine \nwhether  an  agency  action  is  arbitrary  and  capricious,  a  reviewing  court  must  conduct  a \n“thorough, probing, in-depth review” of the agencies’ actions and a “searching and careful” \ninquiry into the underlying facts.3 Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.  v. Volpe, 401 U.S. \n402, 415-16 (1971). Actions are arbitrary and capricious where, among other things, an agency \nfails to offer a reasoned explanation for reversing a prior policy, Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. \nState Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 41-42 (1983), fails to consider and analyze “all relevant issues and \nfactors,” including the serious reliance interests engendered by the prior policy, Long Island \nHead Start Child Dev. Servs. v. N.L.R.B., 460 F.3d 254, 258-260 (2d Cir. 2006); Perez v. \nMortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S.Ct. 1199, 1209 (2015), or adopts a pretextual rationale for its \naction, Public Citizen v. Heckler, 653 F. Supp. 1229, 1237 (D.D.C. 1986). Although Defendants \nviolated all of these prohibitions, a finding by this Court that they simply violated one of them is \nsufficient to sustain a ruling that Defendants acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. \n                                                 \n2 The arbitrary and capricious standard applies to agency actions other than rulemaking, including policy statements. \nSee, e.g., Bechtel v. FCC, 10 F.3d 875, 878, 887 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that a policy statement exempt from \nnotice and comment was arbitrary and capricious). \n3 In addition, review of agency action may include information outside the Administrative Record where an \nagency’s failure to explain an action frustrates effective judicial review, Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973), \nYale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F.3d 71, 82 (2d. Cir. 2006), or where an agency has engaged in bad faith or \nimproper behavior, such as discrimination. Nat’l Nutritional Foods Ass’n v. Mathews, 557 F.2d 325 (2d. Cir. 1977). \nHere, Defendants have both failed to adequately explain their actions, see infra Part I.A., and acted on an improper \nbasis, see infra Part I.B. Therefore, the Court may consider information outside the Administrative Record.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 13 of 48 PageID #: 3897\n \n  Defendants’ Termination of DACA Was Arbitrary and Capricious as Defendants \nFailed to Offer a Reasoned Explanation for Reversal of Policy.  \n \nWhen an agency reverses course on a policy it must provide “a reasoned analysis” for its \nreversal. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 41-42 (1983); Yale-New Haven \nHosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[R]eview is particularly searching” when the \nagency changes “[a] settled course of behavior.”). Under certain circumstances, the agency must \nprovide “a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a \nblank  slate.”  FCC  v.  Fox  Television  Stations,  556  U.S.  502,  515  (2009).  This  includes \ncircumstances in which an agency’s action is inconsistent with facts and circumstances that \nunderlay the prior policy. Encino Motorcars LLC v. Navarro, 136 S.Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016). An \nagency’s failure to explain these inconsistencies is reason for holding its policy reversal arbitrary \nand capricious. Id.      \n1.  Defendants did not offer reasoned, evidence-based rationales for reversing their \nprior position. \n \nIn the memo terminating DACA (the “Termination Memo”), Defendants’ cite only two \nreasons for terminating DACA: the risk that continuing the program would result in litigation, \nand the program’s purported unlawfulness.4 In drawing these conclusions, Defendants provide \nno assessment of the litigation risk or explanation of their legal reasoning. This lack of reasoned \nanalysis is particularly striking since Defendants’ newfound position is squarely inconsistent \nwith their prior position, namely that DACA is a deeply rooted, lawful exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion. \n                                                 \n4 See Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine Kelly to James McCament, Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services, Rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, September 5, 2017 (“Termination \nMemo”), AR 252-55. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 14 of 48 PageID #: 3898\n \nDefendants failed to provide a reasoned assessment of the litigation risk resulting from \ncontinuing the DACA program. When seeking to reverse policy based on a purported risk of \nlitigation, an agency must explain why it determined that case law was “fatal” to the prior policy. \nInt’l Union of Mine Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 358 F.3d 40, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (finding \narbitrary an agency’s reversal of a rule based on a court decision to reverse a separate rule). \nWhile  Defendants  reference  decisions  by  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  Supreme  Court  in  their \nTermination Memo, the Memo and Administrative Record includes no assessment explaining \nwhy these cases were “fatal” to DACA.5 Moreover, a valid consideration of litigation risk would \nentail weighing the comparative costs and burdens of taking different actions, an analysis also \nabsent from the Termination Memo and Administrative Record. Defendants’ failure to assess or \nanalyze the potential risk of litigation undermines their subsequent reliance on that risk to \nterminate DACA. \nFurther, Defendants were aware that their desire to avoid litigation could not be achieved \nby their decision to terminate DACA, as that decision was also subject to the virtual certainty of \nlitigation. Defendants’ attempt to avoid a lawsuit initiated by the State of Texas merely “traded” \nthat lawsuit for this suit by Plaintiff States. Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 \nF.3d 956, 970 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (rejecting litigation risk rationale as “implausible” where \nagency “deliberately traded one lawsuit for another”).  \n                                                 \n5 DACA Termination Memo, AR 252-55. In fact, the decisions arising out of Texas v. United States do not support \nthe conclusion that DACA is unlawful as: (1) the Texas court did not find constitutional defects in DAPA. 809 F.3d \n134, 154 (5th Cir. 2015) (“We decide this appeal, however, without resolving the Constitutional claim.”); (2) the \nlegality of the original DACA policy was never at issue in Texas and no court has held DACA itself unlawful. Id. at \n173; (3) the Fifth Circuit found legally significant differences between DAPA and DACA. Id. at 173-74 (finding that \n“for a number of reasons, any extrapolation [of DAPA] from DACA must be done carefully”); and (4) the Fifth \nCircuit decision regarding DAPA’s legal defects is not persuasive in light of the flaws in that reasoning discussed in \nBr. Of  U.S., United States v. Texas, 2016 WL 836758 (U.S. 2016). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 15 of 48 PageID #: 3899\n \n  Defendants also failed to provide any legal analysis in support of their conclusions \nregarding the lawfulness of the DACA program. The Termination Memo relies entirely on a one-\nline  assertion  in  a  letter  from  the  Attorney  General  that  DACA  “has  the  same  legal  and \nconstitutional defects” that the Fifth Circuit and a divided Supreme Court recognized as to the \nDeferred  Action  for  Parents  of  Americans  and  Lawful  Permanent  Residents  (“DAPA”) \nprogram.6  \nAgencies are obligated to provide reasons, not bare conclusions, to support an action. \nAmerijet Int’l v.

Defendants’ \nreliance on cursory and erroneous conclusions renders its decision arbitrary and capricious. \n2.  Defendants’ termination failed to acknowledge inconsistencies with their prior \nposition. \n \nDefendants  failed  to  explain  the  inconsistencies  between  their  stated  reasons  for \nterminating DACA, and their prior well-reasoned and in-depth analysis supporting the program. \nIn substantial analyses provided in an Office of Legal Counsel opinion in 2014, and in briefs in \nsupport  of  the  DAPA  program  filed  with  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court,7 \nDefendants explained that the DACA program was lawful.

Based on the complete failure to explain these inconsistencies, Defendants’ \ntermination decision is arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n                                                 \n8 Prior to termination, Defendants received a letter from prominent law professors who presented substantial, \nreasoned analysis supporting the lawfulness of the DACA program. See Ex. 87 (Ltr from Shobha Wadhia et al. to \nPresident Donald Trump, Aug. 14, 2017). Defendants ignored this letter. \n9 Sessions Letter, AR 251. \n10 See Ex. 1, ¶ 24 (Wadhia Decl.). \n11 See Id. at, ¶¶ 31-44, 60-65. \n12 See Id. at, ¶¶ 40-41, 61, 71; For example, President Reagan’s “Family Fairness” program shares several \nsimilarities to DACA. It provided deferred action for children under 18 whose parents were eligible for permanent \nresidency legalizing under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Three years later, the Family Fairness \nprogram was expanded under President George H.W. Bush. That Executive program made 1.5 million people \neligible for relief out of a total undocumented population of 3.5 million. Just like DACA grantees, Family Fairness \ngrantees were also allowed to apply for employment authorization. Eventually, Congress acted to provide a \npermanent solution for many of these individuals. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 17 of 48 PageID #: 3901\n \n  Defendants’ Termination Did Not Account for the Significant Reliance Interests \nCreated by DACA, or Consider Any Steps to Mitigate the Harm of Termination. \n \nWhen reversing a prior policy that “engendered serious reliance interests,” agencies must \nprovide  a  reasoned  explanation  for  disregarding  facts  and  circumstances  that  underlay  that \npolicy. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). In addition, agencies must \nconsider all “relevant factors” during the decision-making process. State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43(1983) (citing to Bowman Transp. Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, 419 U.S. 281, 285-86 \n(1974)). Those factors include “the costs as well as the benefits” of the action. State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 54. Failing to consider an “important aspect of the problem” is grounds for finding an \naction arbitrary and capricious. Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 808 F.3d 556, 569, \n576–77  (2d  Cir.  2015).  Defendants  violated  the  APA  by  disregarding  the  serious  reliance \ninterests engendered by DACA, and utterly failing to consider any of the costs triggered by \nterminating DACA.  \nWhile Defendants single-mindedly focused on their unfounded legal conclusions, they \nignored the serious reliance interests engendered by DACA. Since 2012, nearly 800,000 grantees \nhave relied on DACA to “come out of the shadows” and integrate into their communities.13 \nGrantees  have  relied  on  the  promises  of the  DACA  program  to  make  long-term  decisions \ninconsistent with a sudden end to the program. For instance, many grantees have enrolled in \nmulti-year degree programs that will now be disrupted.14 One in twenty grantees has relied on \n                                                 \n13 Ex. 2 (Updated USCIS, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017, Sept. \n30, 2017); Ex. 3, McCament Dep. 158: 3 –159:1. \n14 See Ex. 4, ¶ 13 (Andrade Decl.)

Yet Defendants considered none of this before terminating \nDACA. The Termination Memo and Administrative Record contain no references to reliance \ninterests and no cost evaluation. Defendants ignored any readily obtainable data regarding the \npotential impact of termination.

Defendants even ignored the obvious alternative of allowing \ncurrent grantees to continue receiving deferred action. Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and \ncapricious because they did not consider any reasonably available alternatives to mitigate the \nharm to hundreds of thousands of grantees—as well state and local governments, employers, and \nuniversities—who rely on the program.  \nAn Executive action that has the potential to disrupt millions of lives calls for “extensive \nstudy and analysis.” United States. v.

An agency’s reasoning is pretextual \nwhere the agency makes statements contradicting its purported rationale.  \nHere,  administration  officials  made  statements  that  conflict  with  and  undermine \nDefendants’ proposed justifications for terminating DACA. While the Termination Memo cites \nthe risk of litigation as a reason for terminating the DACA program, an administration official \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 21 of 48 PageID #: 3905\n \ninvolved in the decision-making process noted that an agency acting on the basis of litigation \nrisk was the “craziest policy you could ever have in a Department.”25 In addition, on September \n5, 2017, the same day DHS issued the Termination Memo, President Trump tweeted, “Congress \nnow has 6 months to legalize DACA . . . If they can’t, I will revisit the issue.”26 The President’s \npromise to “revisit the issue” implies that the Executive has the authority to extend DACA, an \nimplication  inconsistent  with  Defendants’  statement  that  DACA  was  “effectuated…without \nproper  statutory  authority”  and  that  the  program  was  “an  unconstitutional  exercise  of \nauthority.”27  \nIn fact, Defendants’ contradictory rationales for terminating DACA masked the “true \nbasis” for their decision—animus toward Latinos, who make up 93% of DACA grantees. Where \nan agency rests its action on an “impermissible basis,” including invidious discrimination against \na particular race or group, it abuses its discretion. Wong Wing Hang v. I.N.S., 360 F.2d 715, 718-\n19 (2d. Cir. 1966); Bertrand v. Sava, 684 F. 2d 204, 212-213 (2d. Cir. 1982); Haitian Ctrs. \nCouncil, Inc. v.

First,  in  announcing  his \npresidential campaign, candidate Trump promised to eliminate DACA and compared Mexican \n                                                 \n25 Ex. 32, Hamilton Dep. 207:20-208:11.

They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and \nthey’re  bringing  those  problems  with  us.  They’re  bringing  drugs.  They’re  bringing  crime. \nThey’re rapists.”28 Subsequently, in announcing the termination of DACA, President Trump’s \nappointed Attorney General used the same rhetoric and falsely associated DACA and its grantees \nwith “crime, violence, and even terrorism.”29 \nDefendants’ use of racial code words to discuss issues related to immigration and the \ncontinuation  of  DACA  provide  additional  evidence  of  their  discriminatory  animus  towards \nLatinos. The campaign of then-candidate Trump and President Trump’s Administration once \ninstalled have repeatedly invoked this strategy and used code words such as “criminals,” “drug \ndealer,” “thugs,” and “cartel,” in reference to Latino immigrants.30 For example, less than four \nweeks before the termination of DACA, President Trump made a speech featuring racially coded \nlanguage  about undocumented individuals who cross the Mexican border. President Trump \nlumped together all such individuals, including DACA grantees, and characterized the entire \ncollective as involved in “gangs,” “cartels” and “trafficking.”31 He further referred to these \nindividuals as “animals” and stated that America needed to be “liberat[ed]” from them.32 On a \n                                                 \n28 Ex. 38, ¶ 68 (Pitti Decl.); See also Id. at ¶ 66 (Candidate Trump’s description of men who used anti-immigrant \nlanguage, and beat a sleeping Latino man, as “passionate” people who “love their country”), and ¶¶ 110, 128, 134 \n(Candidate Trump referred to Latinos as “bad hombres,” swore he would construct a border wall to keep Mexicans \nout of the United States, and falsely attributed American public health crises to Mexican immigration).

Further, President Trump, during both his candidacy and presidency, has repeatedly equated \nLatino immigrants as terrorists, enemies of the United States, and un-American. This negative language describing \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 23 of 48 PageID #: 3907\n \nseparate occasion, President Trump grouped Mexican individuals with inanimate objects such as \ncars coming across the borders, and referred to both collectively as “vomit.”33 Attorney General \nSessions has similarly described Mexicans as “filth.”34  \nIn short, Defendants’ claim that they terminated DACA based on litigation risk or the \nprogram’s unlawfulness is implausible given that Defendants previously concluded that DACA \nis legal and knew that litigation was certain to result from the abrupt cancellation of the program. \nAmple evidence of Defendants’ animus towards Latinos demonstrates that their stated reasons \nfor terminating DACA are not only implausible, but also pretextual. Because rendering decisions \nbased on invidious discrimination is ipso facto an abuse of discretion, Defendants acts’ violated \nthe APA. \n  Defendants’ Termination of DACA Violated Equal Protection. \nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the United States to \nprovide equal protection of the laws to all persons. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638, \nn. 2 (1975) (“[W]hile the Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause, it does forbid \ndiscrimination that is so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process. This Court’s approach to \nFifth  Amendment  equal  protection  claims  has  always  been  precisely  the  same  as  to  equal \nprotection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.” (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted; alteration in original)); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500 (1954) (holding that \nthe Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains an equal protection safeguard). Pursuant to \n                                                                                                                                                             \nLatinos is contrasted with positive language Defendant Trump has used for Whites, such as “‘good Americans,’ ‘tax \npayers,’ ‘hard-working citizens, ‘members of our communities,’ and the like.” \n33 Id. at ¶ 133 (Pitti Decl.). \n34 Id. at ¶¶ 22, 134 (Pitti Decl.). In addition, President Trump terminated DACA less than two weeks after pardoning \nformer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a man convicted for racially profiling Latinos in defiance of court \norders. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 24 of 48 PageID #: 3908\n \nthat guarantee, government action that is motivated by animus toward individuals—whether such \nanimus is based on race, ethnicity, national origin or any other ground—is unconstitutional. See \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996); U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 \n(1973). Defendants’ termination of DACA violates Equal Protection because it was motivated by \nanimus toward Latinos and Defendants’ stated reasons for their action are baseless and illogical.  \nIt is axiomatic that governmental action borne out of “a bare . . . desire to harm a \npolitically unpopular group” cannot constitute equal protection of the laws. Moreno, 413 U.S. at \n534. Although “discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof,” Mhany Mgmt v. Cty.  \nof Nassau, 819 F.3d 581, 606 (2d Cir. 2016), occasionally the record contains unambiguous \nevidence  of  the  decisionmaker’s  animus.  For  example,  in  Moreno,  the  federal  government \namended  the  Food  Stamp  Act  in  order  to  render  unrelated  individuals  who  live  together \nineligible for food stamps. Id. at 530. The Supreme Court determined the law unconstitutional \nbecause the scant legislative record demonstrated that the amendment was intended to target \n“hippies” and “hippie communes” to ensure they could not obtain food stamps. Id. at 534. \nSimilarly,  in  Romer,  the  Court  analyzed  a  state  constitutional  amendment  that  stripped \nhomosexual individuals, but no other group, of the ability to obtain legal protections against \ndiscrimination. When invalidating the amendment, the Court found its “sheer breadth is so \ndiscontinuous with the reasons offered for it that [it] seems inexplicable by anything but animus \ntoward the class it affects.” Romer, 517 U.S at 632.   \nAs in Moreno, this case is one of those rare instances in which the record reflects \nunambiguous evidence of Defendants’ animus towards Latinos. See supra Part I.C. (describing \nevidence of  Defendants’ animus toward  Latino individuals). Further, similar to Romer, the \n“sheer breadth” of Defendants’ termination of DACA—a wholesale stripping of eligibility for \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 25 of 48 PageID #: 3909\n \nemployment and imposition of substantial obstacles to obtaining higher education for nearly \n800,000  individuals,  without  exception—despite  the  significant  reliance  interests  for  those \nindividuals,  their  U.S.  citizen  children,  and  Plaintiff  States  and  their  residents,  “seems \ninexplicable by anything but animus towards the class it affects.” See Romer, 517 U.S. at 632. \nBecause animus can never constitute a legitimate state interest, see id. at 634-35, Defendants’ \ntermination of DACA is unconstitutional. \nEven if the record did not contain ample evidence of Defendants’ animus, the termination \nof DACA would still violate equal protection principles. “In the ordinary case, a [challenged \npolicy] will be sustained if it can be said to advance a legitimate government interest,” meaning \nthe policy is “narrow enough in scope and grounded in a sufficient factual context for [a court] to \nascertain some relation between the classification and the purpose it served.” Romer, 517 U.S. at \n632-33; see also Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 324 (1993) (a policy “fails rational-basis review” \nwhen it “rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to achievement of the [stated] objective”) (citation \nand internal quotations omitted). Thus, even under the most deferential form of scrutiny,35 courts \nmust analyze government action to ensure it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental \ninterest. Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33; Moreno, 413 U.S. at 533. Defendants’ stated bases for \n                                                 \n35 The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the level of scrutiny that applies to an equal protection claim based \non discrimination against a suspect class in the immigration context. See, e.g., Kandamar v. Gonzalez, 464 F.3d 65, \n72 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 60-61 (2001)). In Nguyen, the Court upheld a statute that \nmade it more difficult for a child to claim U.S. citizenship if the child was born abroad and out of wedlock to a U.S. \ncitizen father as compared to a U.S. citizen mother. 533 U.S. at 60-61. The Court concluded that the gender-based \nclassification served an important government objective and the discriminatory classification was substantially \nrelated to the achievement of that objective. Id. at 60. Although the Nguyen Court applied heightened scrutiny to \nassess the law, it stated that “[g]iven [the Court’s] determination [about the statute at issue], we need not decide \nwhether  some  lesser  degree  of  scrutiny  pertains  because  the  statute  implicates  Congress’  immigration  and \nnaturalization power.” Id. at 61 (citations omitted). Here, Plaintiff States do not concede that Congress’ immigration \nand naturalization power is only subject to the most deferential form of scrutiny in all circumstances.  This is \nespecially so given that courts have acknowledged that Latinos are a suspect class for equal protection analysis, and \nthus entitled to heightened scrutiny.  Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, 717 F.2d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 1983). Rather, Plaintiff \nStates only argue that Defendants’ animus toward Latinos—as evidenced in the record—fails even the most \ndeferential Equal Protection test.      \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 26 of 48 PageID #: 3910\n \nterminating DACA fail even this highly deferential standard because there exists no rational \nrelationship  between  means  and  ends.  Specifically,  Defendants  have  asserted  that  they \nterminated DACA to avoid “the prospect of continued litigation”36 because DACA is unlawful \nand unconstitutional.37 But no court has held that DACA is illegal, and prior to its recent about-\nface, the government consistently affirmed DACA’s legality.38 Further, Defendants were on \nnotice that abruptly terminating DACA would trigger this very lawsuit, thus destroying any \nargument that ending DACA would somehow avert litigation.39 In addition, government officials \ninvolved in the termination of DACA acknowledge that litigation risk is not a reasonable basis \nfor directing a sea change in government policy.40 The irrationality of the decision to terminate is \nparticularly stark given the stakes for the Plaintiff States and their residents. See infra Part IV \n(describing irreparable harm).   \nMoreover, the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982) cautions \nthat this Court should be especially skeptical of Defendants’ actions because they are harming a \ngroup of individuals who “are present in this country through no fault of their own,” Id. at 226.41 \nIndeed,  a  “special  constitutional  sensitivity”  attaches  where,  as  here,  a  government  action \n                                                 \n36 Mem.

Defendants’  termination  of  DACA  is  also \nunconstitutional because there exists no rational relationship between that policy and their stated \nobjectives. This irrationality is especially problematic given the blameless nature of the class \naffected.  Thus,  Plaintiff  States  have  shown  a  likelihood  of  success  on  their  claim  that \nDefendants’ termination of DACA violates Equal Protection.  \n  Defendants’ Termination of DACA Violates the Procedural Requirements of the \nAPA and RFA.  \n \nIn addition to its substantive defects, the termination of DACA is procedurally invalid. \nBy terminating DACA without allowing for notice and comment or conducting a regulatory \nflexibility analysis, Defendants violated the APA and RFA.  \nRules created by federal agencies are generally subject to notice and comment. APA \nrequirements “are designed (1) to ensure that agency regulations are tested via exposure to \ndiverse public comment, (2) to ensure fairness to affected parties, and (3) to give affected parties \nan opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections to the rule and \nthereby enhance the quality of judicial review.” United States v. Lott, 750 F.3d 214, 219 (2d Cir. \n2014) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The APA requires notice of proposed agency \nrules and an opportunity to comment for all “legislative” or “substantive” rules,43 exempting \nonly “interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, \nor practice.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A); Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302–303 (1979); \nWhite  v.  Shalala,  7  F.3d  296,  303  (2d  Cir.  1993).  In  other  words,  notice  and  comment \nrulemaking applies to all rules other than those that describe “an agency’s intended course of \n                                                 \n43 While the terms “legislative” and “substantive” are used interchangeably in this context, Plaintiff States use the \nterm “legislative” consistent with the preference identified by the Second Circuit. White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 303 \n(2d Cir. 1993). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 29 of 48 PageID #: 3913\n \naction” (general statements of policy), “its tentative view of the meaning of a particular statutory \nterm” (interpretative rules), or “internal house-keeping measures organizing agency activities” \n(procedural rules). Perales v. Sullivan, 948 F.2d 1348, 1354 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal citation and \nquotations omitted). Notice and comment is required whenever agency action does not fall \nwithin  these  specific  exemptions,  which  “must  be  narrowly  construed.”  United  States  v. \nPicciotto, 875 F.2d 345, 347 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nWhen the APA’s notice and comment requirements apply, the RFA further requires a \nregulatory  flexibility  analysis  to  assess  a  prospective  rule’s  impact  on  small  businesses, \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions, unless the head of the agency certifies that the \nrule will not affect small entities.44 5 U.S.C. §§ 601(2), 603(a) 604(a), 605(b); see also U.S. \nTelecom Ass’n v. FCC, 400 F.3d 29, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC should have provided notice of a \nrule under 5 U.S.C. § 553 (Rulemaking), so the RFA’s requirements were applicable).  \nIn this case, the termination does not fall under the APA’s exemptions for interpretive or \nprocedural  rules,  because  it  affects  existing  rights  and  interests  in  profound  ways.  The \ntermination is not exempt as a general statement of policy because it binds the discretion of DHS \nand its officials. Moreover, the substantial impact of the rule has engendered significant public \ninterest, which weighs in favor of public input through notice and comment. Yet Defendants \nterminated DACA after a few brief meetings and without the benefit of input and analysis from \n                                                 \n44 The termination directly affects small entities, in that it prohibits them from continuing to employ DACA \ngrantees. See Aeronautical Repair Station Ass’n v. F.A.A., 494 F.3d 161, 177–78 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (a rule that \nrequired employees to undergo drug and alcohol testing “directly affected” contractors and subcontractors, not just \nprimary employers). But absent this direct effect, the DHS Secretary would have been required to certify, by \npublication in the Federal Register, that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities, along with a factual basis for such certification. See 5 U.S.C. § 605(b). The DHS Secretary \nissued no such certification here. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 30 of 48 PageID #: 3914\n \nnumerous stakeholders. Under the APA and the RFA, a more deliberative and public process was \nrequired.  \n  The Termination Changed Existing Rights and Interests.  \n \nWhether a rule is “legislative” rather than “interpretive” or “procedural” turns on whether \nthe rule “creates new law, rights, or duties in what amounts to a legislative act.” Sweet v. \nSheahan, 235 F.3d 80, 91 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting White, 7 F.3d at 303). Thus, where a rule \n“change[s] existing rights and obligations,” it is a legislative rule. Donovan v. Red Star Marine \nServs., Inc., 739 F.2d 774, 783 (2d Cir. 1984) (citing Lewis-Mota v. Sec’y of Labor, 469 F.2d \n478, 482 (2d Cir.1972) (internal citations omitted). “A procedural rule, by contrast, ‘does not \nalter the rights or interests of parties, although it may alter the manner in which the parties \npresent themselves or their viewpoints to the agency.’” Time Warner Cable Inc. v. F.C.C., 729 \nF.3d 137, 168 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n653 F.3d 1, 5-6 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). And an “interpretive” rule “merely ‘clarif[ies] an existing \nstatute or regulation.’” N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp. v. Saranac Power Partners, L.P., 267 F.3d \n128, 131 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted). \nHere, the rule terminating DACA significantly altered the rights and interests of hundreds \nof thousands of DACA grantees and DACA-eligible individuals. Current grantees will lose \ndeferred status and work authorization benefits when their terms expire and they are precluded \nfrom the opportunity to renew. DACA grantees were repeatedly assured that their requests for \nrenewal of their lawful presence would be considered if they followed the rules of the DACA \nprogram.45 As Former Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly affirmed, once an individual \n                                                 \n45 See Napolitano Memo, June 15, 2012, AR 1; Ex. 41 (USCIS Help Center, DACA FAQs); Ex. 42 (USCIS Help \nCenter, How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA); Ex. 43 (USCIS DACA Approval Notice).  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 31 of 48 PageID #: 3915\n \nwas granted deferred prosecution under DACA, he or she was granted a “commitment … by the \ngovernment.”46 Walking away from that “commitment” curtails DACA grantees’ existing rights \nand deeply affects their interests. The termination also categorically disallows all applications for \ndeferred action for all those who satisfy DACA’s established criteria. Prospective grantees have \nlost not only the ability to apply for deferred action based on that criteria, but also access to work \nauthorization, social security cards, advance parole (under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)), and numerous \ncollateral benefits. Thus, the rule does not fall under the interpretive or procedural exemptions of \nthe APA. \n  The Termination Binds the Discretion of DHS and Its Officials.  \n \nThe termination is more than a “general statement of policy” because it binds DHS \ndiscretion. To determine whether the exemption to notice and comment applies, courts look to \nwhether a rule binds the discretion of the agency and its officials. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. E.P.A., \n290 F.3d 377, 382–83 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (notice and comment is required when a rule “expresses a \nchange in substantive law or policy (that is not an interpretation) which the agency intends to \nmake binding, or administers with binding effect.”) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The \n“critical factor” in distinguishing a legislative rule from a general statement of policy is “the \nextent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to \nexercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.” \nMunicipality of Anchorage v. United States, 980 F.2d 1320, 1324 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting \nMada–Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1013-14 (9th Cir.1987)). Thus, “cabining of an \nagency’s prosecutorial discretion” rises to the level of a legislative rule where it requires agency \n                                                 \n46 Ex. 44 (Ted Hesson & Seung Min Kim, Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration, Politico, \nMar. 29, 2017). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 32 of 48 PageID #: 3916\n \nofficials to take a particular approach.

From now on, DHS “[w]ill reject all \nDACA initial requests … filed after the date of this memorandum,” “[w]ill reject all DACA \nrenewal requests” outside of a strict wind-down period which has already ended, “[w]ill not \napprove any new Form I-131 applications for advance parole,” and “[w]ill administratively close \nall pending Form I-131 applications for advance parole” by DACA grantees (emphasis added).47 \nThis type of “mandatory, definitive language is a powerful, even potentially dispositive, factor” \nin determining whether a rule is substantive. Young, 818 F.2d at 947. In fact, DHS officials \ncurrently retain no discretion to fulfill any DACA-related requests, whether for initial or renewal \napplications or for advance parole. Cf. Dimaren v. Immigr. and Naturalization Serv., 398 F.Supp. \n556, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (rule was exempt from notice and comment because agency officials \nwere  free  to  give  an  immigration  policy  memorandum  “whatever  weight  [they]  deemed \nappropriate,” so it did not bind their discretion). Moreover, DACA grantees and DACA-eligible \nindividuals are bound in that they cannot meaningfully request deferred action or advance parole \nunder the framework that they could under DACA.  \n                                                 \n47 DACA Termination Memo, AR 252-255. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 33 of 48 PageID #: 3917\n \nUnlike the DACA termination, deferred action programs usually end when circumstances \nrender them no longer necessary (such as new statutory protections coming from Congress).48 In \none circumstance in which the government attempted to eliminate a prosecutorial discretion \nprogram for a class of non-citizens, however, a federal court determined that notice and comment \nrulemaking was required under the APA.

In  Parco,  the  federal  government  attempted  to  terminate  a  policy  that  granted \nextended stay in the U.S. for individuals awaiting a certain type of visa. Because this decision \nstripped agency officials of discretion to offer relief, the court found that it was a “flat rule of \neligibility” rather than a “general statement of policy.” Id. The DACA termination allows for \neven less discretion than that in Parco, as the Parco termination explicitly left in place discretion \nto grant relief in “compelling” cases, id. at 981, while the DACA termination flatly states that \nDACA requests will be rejected. Parco distinguished the Second Circuit’s decision in Noel v. \nChapman, 508 F.2d 1023, 1029 (2d Cir. 1975), which upheld a different aspect of the same \ntermination decision against an APA challenge. In Noel, the challenged aspect of the policy \nserved as only a “guideline” for agency discretion, left relevant determinations in the “sole \ndiscretion” of agency officials, and contained an explicit “hardship” exception.” Id. at 1030. The \ndifference  between  Noel and Parco is analogous  to the difference between the creation of \ndeferred action policies (such as DACA) and the DACA termination. Deferred action policies for \ngroups of people provide guidance to agency officials in the field to inform their exercise of \ndiscretion in individual cases.49 The DACA termination, on the other hand, mandates that agency \n                                                 \n48 See Ex. 1, ¶ 76 (Wadhia Decl.). \n49 See Ex. 1, ¶ 51, 53 (Wadhia Decl.).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 34 of 48 PageID #: 3918\n \nofficials reject all requests of a certain type. Thus, the termination cannot be characterized as a \nstatement of policy exempt from notice and comment. \n  A Strong Public Interest in the Treatment of DACA Grantees Weighs in Favor of \nNotice and Comment. \n \nCourts also recognize that the question of whether the impact of a rule is substantial \nenough  to  trigger  notice  and  comment  is  ‘“one  of  degree’  depending  upon  ‘whether  the \nsubstantive effect is sufficiently grave so that notice and comment are needed to safeguard the \npolicies underlying the APA.’” Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr., 653 F.3d at 5-6 (internal citations \nomitted). A strong public interest in a rule thus weighs in favor of a finding that the rule is \nlegislative in nature, and therefore subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. Hoctor v. U.S. \nDept. of Agric., 82 F.3d 165, 171 (7th Cir. 1996) (“The greater the public interest in a rule, the \ngreater reason to allow the public to participate in its formation.”).  \nThere is a strong public interest in the protection of the DACA program, not only from \nhundreds of thousands of DACA grantees themselves, but also from states, colleges, universities, \nbusinesses, non-profits, cities and towns, school districts, family members, and taxpayers who \nhave  invested  significant  resources  and  benefitted  from  the  DACA  program.  All  of  these \nindividuals and entities will be significantly harmed when hundreds of thousands of young \npeople  lose  the  opportunities  and  security  that  DACA  has  provided.  Accord  infra  Part  IV \n(cataloguing  the  irreparable  harm  that  Plaintiff  States  and  their  residents  will  suffer  if  the \ntermination  is  not  enjoined).  This  substantial  impact  merits  the  opportunity  for  notice  and \ncomment by those affected. Thus, Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on their claim that \nDefendants violated the APA and RFA by foregoing notice and comment procedures and a \nregulatory flexibility analysis. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 35 of 48 PageID #: 3919\n \nPLAINTIFF STATES SATISFY THE REMAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n  Plaintiff States also satisfy the remaining requirements of the preliminary injunction \nstandard, as the States will suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief, preliminary relief \nis in the public interest, and the balance of equities weigh in favor of the States. \n  Absent an Injunction, the States Will Suffer Irreparable Harm. \nPlaintiff States and their residents will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 22.50 Plaintiff States’ demonstration that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their equal protection claim establishes that they will incur irreparable harm. See Jolly \nv. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir. 1996) (“the alleged violation of a constitutional right [] \ntriggers a finding of irreparable harm”); see also Statharos v. N.Y.

The termination will \nnegatively  impact  the  States’  child  welfare  systems  as  the  U.S.  citizen  children  of  DACA \ngrantees may be placed in the States’ care as a result of their parents inability to remain legally in \nthe United States.52 Increased fear of deportation will also harm public safety, since without \nDACA status, DACA grantees will be less likely to report violence, abuse, crimes or other harms \nto the community.53 The States will also suffer concrete and irreparable injury, as regulators and \nlicensors, employers, and providers of education and health care systems.54 State and local \neconomies  will  also  be  harmed.

However, due to the termination, both States may have to amend their rules to \ninclude former DACA grantees in that coverage, which will drain State resources.75 Access to \ncare will also be limited for dependents of DACA grantees, including U.S. citizen children, once \nDACA grantees lose their work authorizations and private insurance coverage.76 An increased \nstrain on State-funded healthcare programs and a subsequent lack of access to care for the States’ \nresidents is irreparable and imminent harm.   \n \n                                                 \n71 See Ex. 10, ¶ 10(e) (Wong.

The country as a \nwhole will lose approximately $215 billion over the next ten years in economic contributions by \nDACA grantees,77 and states and localities will lose an estimated $797 million in tax revenues.78 \nStates also will be deprived of DACA grantees’ critical contribution to vulnerable communities \nand key sectors in their states. For example, many DACA grantee students have expressed \ninterest in—and have in fact obtained—scholarships that require them to work in rural or under-\nserved communities as physicians, lawyers, and healthcare professionals once they finish their \nstudies.79 They will no longer be able to do so.  \nMore than 90% of DACA grantees are employed, and the program has allowed many \ngrantees to obtain better paying employment that more closely matches their education and \ntraining.80 Moreover, one in twenty grantees has relied on the program to start a business, a rate \nhigher than that of native-born Americans.81 Termination will translate into smaller consumer \nand legal workforce bases within the States,82 harming the private sector and especially small \n                                                 \n77 See Ex. 96, ¶ 14 (Brannon Decl.). \n78 See Ex. 97, ¶ 6 (Decl.

The only way to head off the imminent and irreparable harms that termination \non March 5, 2018 will cause is for the Court to grant preliminary relief until this lawsuit is fully \nresolved.  \n  The Public Interest and the Balance of the Equities Weigh in Favor of a Preliminary \nInjunction.  \n \nThe  public  interest  and  the  balance  of  the  equities  weigh  in  favor  of  granting  a \npreliminary injunction.84 Both favor “preventing the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” \nAriz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d at 1069 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, \n695  F.3d  990,  1002  (9th  Cir.2012))  (brackets  omitted).  The  public  interest  also  favors \ncompliance by agencies with their obligations under the APA and RFA. See N. Mariana Islands, \n686 F.Supp.2d at 21 (“the public interest is served when administrative agencies comply with \ntheir obligations under the APA”). Here, Plaintiff States have shown  that Defendants have \nviolated the constitutional guarantee of Equal Protection, as well as the APA and RFA. In fact, \n                                                 \n83 See Ex. 10, ¶¶ 6, 11-12, 18, 23 (Wong Decl.); See also Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 978 (9th \nCir. 2017) (“Plaintiffs' inability to obtain drivers' licenses hinders them in pursuing new jobs, attending work, \nadvancing their careers, and developing business opportunities. They thus suffer financial harm and significant \nopportunity costs. And as we have previously found, the irreparable nature of this injury is exacerbated by Plaintiffs' \nyoung age and fragile socioeconomic status”). \n84 Plaintiffs choose to address these prongs although this showing may not be necessary. See Actavis at 662, n 38. \n(“We need not consider the balance of the hardships given that New York has demonstrated a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits.”).  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 96-1   Filed 12/15/17   Page 43 of 48 PageID #: 3927\n \nall parties agree that DACA has brought great benefit to DACA grantees, their families, their \nschools, their employers, their states, and the nation at large.85 Absent an injunction, DACA \ngrantees, the States and their residents will face grave costs. Provisional relief benefits the public \ninterest.  \nIn contrast to the harm faced by the public if DACA is terminated, Defendants will suffer \nminimal to no harm if the court grants an injunction. A grant of preliminary relief here would \nrequire DHS to review additional DACA applications—a mere continuation of current practice \nas DHS already anticipates that it will be processing applications up to and after March 5, \n2018.86  The  small  cost  of  processing  additional  applications  pales  in  comparison  to  the \nirreparable harm that will befall Plaintiff States absent an injunction.87 Any delay caused by a \npreliminary injunction pending adjudication on the merits will not significantly change this \ncalculation  nor  impede  the  orderly  functioning  of  the  immigration  system  as  a  whole. \nAccordingly, both the balance of the equities and the public interest favor relief.  \nIndeed, provisional relief preserves the status quo. “In this Circuit, the appropriate status \nquo in need of preservation is that which was in existence before the [challenged conduct] \noccurred.” Hoffman ex rel. Nat’l Labor Relations Bd. v. Inn Credible Caterers, Ltd., 247 F.3d \n360, 369 (2d Cir. 2001). Plaintiff States allege that the termination is unlawful, and an injunction \nwould preserve the status quo during the pendency of this suit by allowing DACA grantees to \n                                                 \n85 See ECF. 54 at ¶¶ 198, 205; Ex. 10, ¶¶ 6, 11-12, 13-14, 18, 22-23 (Wong Decl.); Ex. 110 (Letter from Secretary \nJeh Charles Johnson to Rep.

A critical \ncomponent of NYU’s global mission is to create an intellectually rich educational environment \nencompassing a wide range of perspectives.  By welcoming and engaging students and scholars \nfrom a broad range of backgrounds, NYU is able to advance that mission. \nAs a global university centered in New York City, NYU has a vital interest in the proper \nadministration of the immigration laws of the United States.  NYU is deeply concerned that the \nrescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, as contemplated in \nthe Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to James W. McCament, Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \net al., Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \n(September 5, 2017), available at https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-\nrescission-daca (the “DHS Memorandum”), would, in addition to imposing grievous harm on \nDACA beneficiaries, compromise NYU’s mission by impairing the educational opportunities \nNYU provides to all of its constituents and undermine the values that NYU champions.  Because \nthe DHS Memorandum was promulgated without any of the reasoned consideration and review \nthat is statutorily required, even for far less intrusive and detrimental government actions, NYU \nrespectfully submits that implementation of the DHS Memorandum should be enjoined. \n1 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 7 of 27 PageID #: 6690\n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nEvery year, thousands of prospective students apply to NYU, seeking the opportunity to \nstudy at one of the world’s most internationally diverse universities.  At the core of NYU’s \ninstitutional mission are the twin aims of providing an exceptional academic experience and \nfostering world-class international scholarship.  To support these goals, NYU has invested \nsignificant resources in developing an environment in which students and faculty from all \nbackgrounds have the opportunity not only to take advantage of its unique educational \nenvironment, but also to contribute to a University community that enriches all of its members.  \nThere is no question that enrolling DACA beneficiaries provides significant benefits to the \nUniversity as well.  NYU’s DACA students, both former and present, have succeeded \nacademically and meaningfully contributed to campus life through participation in numerous \nstudent organizations. \nBy rescinding DACA, DHS does more than expose hundreds of thousands of people to \npotential removal from the United States.  It interferes with the ability of those individuals to \nobtain an education and positively contribute to society, and it weakens NYU and institutions \nlike it, because they lose hard-working students and unique voices on campus.  If allowed to go \ninto effect, the DHS Memorandum will make NYU less diverse and obstruct its ability to provide \nall of its students with the educational benefits that flow from a fully diverse student body and \nfaculty. \nThe DHS Memorandum also suffers from significant legal defects.  While DACA \nconstitutes a constitutional and permissible exercise of DHS’s authority, the same cannot be said \nfor its rescission.  In addition to significant constitutional issues, the DHS Memorandum failed to \ncomply with the Administrative Procedure Act, because it provided none of the required \nreasoned analysis or justification for rescinding the DACA program, and because it provided no \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 8 of 27 PageID #: 6691\n \npublic notice and opportunity for comment on the rescission.  The lack of reasoned analysis and \nopportunity for public comment similarly violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act.   \nBecause DACA’s rescission is unlawful, would cause harm to institutions like NYU, and \nwould upend hundreds of thousands of lives nationwide, this Court should enjoin the DHS \nMemorandum. \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 9 of 27 PageID #: 6692\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  A Diverse Community is Critical to NYU’s Identity and Mission \nDiversity, inclusion and equity are “indispensable elements of an NYU education,” “vital \nfor advancing knowledge, sparking innovation, and creating sustainable communities.”1  More \nthan just stated values, these ideals are a part of everything the University does, as it strives to be \na place where people gather from all over the world “to teach, perform, create, and study in a \nplace where everyone belongs.”2  NYU accomplishes these goals by creating an intellectually \nrich environment for its students and scholars—taking academic and cultural advantage of its \nlocation, and embracing diversity among faculty, staff and students to ensure a wide range of \nperspectives in the educational experience.  See id.   \nAs part of its pledge to further the values of diversity, inclusion and equity on its \ncampuses, NYU has committed to: \n  fostering intellectual inquiry, research, and artistic practices that respectfully and \nrigorously take account of a wide range of opinions, perspectives, and \nexperiences; \n  promoting an inclusive community in which diversity is valued and every \nmember feels they have a rightful place, is welcome and respected, and is \nsupported in their endeavors; \n  developing and supporting programs and policies that measurably improve \nNYU’s record of attracting and retaining students, as well as hiring and promoting \nfaculty, administrators, and staff from historically underrepresented communities; \nand  \n  building structures that promote inclusiveness and equity for all members of the \nNYU community, especially our colleagues from marginalized groups.3 \n                                                 \n1 NYU Diversity Statement, available at www.nyu.edu/life/diversity-nyu.html.  \n2 https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/president-\nmessage.html. \n3 See NYU Diversity Statement, supra n.1. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 10 of 27 PageID #: 6693\n \nNYU’s commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity is also manifested in the actions of \nits administration.  Recognizing that sustaining NYU’s values means more than having “as \ndiverse a student body, a faculty, and a staff as possible,” in September 2016, NYU’s provost \nKatherine Fleming observed that, although each of those goals individually is important, the true \nreflection of NYU’s values comes from creating a community where everyone seeks to have “the \nbroadest possible understanding that we can have about what humankind is,” an understanding \nthat comes only when people feel comfortable in the community itself.4 \nNYU has consistently supported programs like DACA, recognizing that they further \nvalues that are paramount to the NYU community.  In 2014, in recognition of the distinct \nchallenges and circumstances that undocumented immigrants face, NYU became the first \nuniversity to offer financial aid applications specifically tailored to undocumented immigrants.5  \nAs NYU’s then-president noted, “[w]hether the next Einstein is documented or not shouldn’t \nmatter when it comes to access to college.”  Id. \nMore recently, when the Attorney General of Texas threatened to bring litigation unless \nDACA was rescinded by September 5, 2017,6 NYU’s President, Andrew Hamilton, wrote to \nPresident Trump urging that DACA be kept in place.7  In his letter, President Hamilton described \nhis own history as an immigrant, and the great extent to which immigrants love their adopted \ncountry, embrace its values and contribute to its society.  Id.  “As an educator,” President \n                                                 \n4 See NYU Diversity Statement, supra n.1. \n5 See Mike Vilensky, NYU Will Offer Financial Aid to Illegal Immigrants, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \n(Nov. 20, 2014), https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyu-will-offer-financial-aid-to-illegal-immigrants-1416536236. \n6 See Letter from K. Paxton, Attorney General of Texas, to J.

Few things would be more at odds with our \nnational ideals than punishing the innocent.  And compassion is a particularly potent and noble \nAmerican quality.”  Id.  Emphasizing the status of DACA beneficiaries as important members of \nthe NYU family—and the broader American family—President Hamilton sounded the themes of \nNYU’s mission for diversity, inclusion and equity: to provide for a richer educational \nenvironment by inviting, welcoming and accepting a wide range of diverse perspectives; and to \ndo what is fair and just.8   \nTo help every student, faculty member and employee at NYU feel like they are an \nintegral part of the University community, NYU provides a variety of programs, services and \ncenters to support its diversity efforts.  Among these programs is the University’s Center for \nMulticultural Education and Programs (“CMEP”), which hosts diversity education and training, \ncultural events and social justice events.9  CMEP publishes a weekly newsletter and has a large \nstaff, including nine senior and professional staff members, six graduate staff members and eight \nundergraduate and design student staff members.10  CMEP “enhances the NYU experience by \nfostering a more inclusive, aware, and socially just community,” through dialogue that explores \n“issues of identity, diversity, and social justice”; support for the diverse NYU community in their \n                                                 \n8 President Hamilton also joined over 700 other college and university presidents in signing onto a \nstatement in support of DACA, highlighting its “highly positive impacts” on educational institutions.  See Statement \nin Support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program and our Undocumented Immigrant \nStudents, https://www.pomona.edu/news/2016/11/21-college-university-presidents-call-us-uphold-and-continue-\ndaca.   The statement further touted the accomplishments of DACA beneficiaries, who “have been exemplary \nstudent scholars and student leaders, working across campus and in the community,” allowing them to “pursue \nopportunities in business, education, high tech, and the non-profit sector,” and “actively contributing to their local \ncommunities and economies.”  Id. \n9 See NYU CMEP website, http://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-\ndiversity/multicultural-education-and-programs.html.   \n10 NYU CMEP, Who We Are, http://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-\ndiversity/multicultural-education-and-programs/who-we-are.html; see also NYU CMEP Events Calendar, \nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/o/nyu-cmep-1875770117. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 12 of 27 PageID #: 6695\n \npersonal, professional and academic lives; educational initiatives and campus-wide programming \nthat engages the NYU community; and the cultivation of allies and advocates to create and \npromote positive change.  Id.   \nNYU also offers a variety of academic programs and student groups focused on exploring \nand celebrating the culture and heritage of the Latino community—the group that would be most \nimpacted by DACA’s rescission.11  For example, NYU’s School of Arts and Science offers a \nLatino Studies Program, “dedicated to the study of the historical, social and cultural experience \nof Latino communities, with a strong interest in the transnational dimensions of U.S. Latino \nlife.”12  The Latino Studies program explores “early colonialism and pre-colonial times” in \ncombination “with the study of contemporary developments such as recent Mexican and South \nAmerican immigration to New York City.”13  NYU is also home to “Latinos Unidos Con Honor \ny Amistad,” or “LUCHA,” a student-run group that was originally founded in 1971 to give a \nvoice to NYU’s growing Latino population.14  In addition, the Latino Law Students Association \n(“LALSA”) at NYU Law School offers a support system within the law school for Latino \nstudents; LALSA also provides “public service to the large and diverse Latino community, from \nmentoring Latino children in lower income neighborhoods to providing bilingual assistance to \nadults.”15  This list reflects just a small sample of programs and groups that support NYU’s \nLatino students and foster an appreciation for the unique contributions of the Latino community \n                                                 \n11 See USCIS, Number of I-821D Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Fiscal Year, \nQuarter, Intake, Biometrics, and Case Status: 2012-2016 (June 30), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/\nUSCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/dac\na_performancedata_fy2016_qtr3.pdf.  \n12 NYU Arts & Science website, Latino Studies, http://as.nyu.edu/latinostudies/about.html.  \n13 Id.  \n14 NYU LUCHA, www.facebook.com/nyulucha/.  \n15 NYU Law website, Latino Law Students Association, http://www.law.nyu.edu/studentorganizations/\nlatinolawstudentsassociation.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 27 PageID #: 6696\n \nto NYU and New York City. 16  These programs, among countless others, support the elements \nof diversity, inclusion and equity that are “indispensable” to an NYU education.17  Fostering \nthese values is critical not simply because it is the right thing to do, but because an educational \nenvironment that encompasses a wealth of varying perspectives gives rise to a campus \ncommunity that sees further and more clearly, as such a community is far more than the sum of \nits parts. \nII.  Implementation of The DHS Memorandum Would Significantly Harm NYU and Its \nConstituents \nBy rescinding DACA without a legislative or other replacement in place, the DHS \nMemorandum threatens a foundational piece of the puzzle that makes diverse educational \ninstitutions such as NYU and its peers beacons of worldwide academic excellence.  Rescission \nthreatens not only to tear individual members of the NYU community away from their families, \nthe NYU family and the country they call home, but to deprive NYU’s community—and the \ncountry as a whole—of DACA beneficiaries’ unique voices, and the significant contributions \nthat they make.18   \n                                                 \n16 Similarly, NYU’s Office of Global Spiritual Life offers a vibrant and diverse community at the “forefront \nof international conversations on religion and spirituality.”  See NYU Office of Global Spiritual Life website, \nhttps://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-diversity/spiritual-life.html.  \n17 Id.; supra notes 8 and 9; see also, e.g., NYU Diverse & Inclusive Virtual Environment, \nhttp://www.nyu.edu/life/diversity-nyu/dive.html.   \n18 While it is not the focus of this brief, NYU is also deeply concerned about the constitutional implications \nof terminating DACA, particularly because the rescission of the program appears to have been motivated in \nsubstantial part by animus towards Latinos and Mexicans.  The most fundamental abuse of government authority \nprohibited by the equal protection doctrine is discrimination against a protected class, especially when that \ndiscrimination is overt.   See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977) \n(“When there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, . . . judicial \ndeference is no longer justified.”); Jana-Rock Const., Inc., v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Econ.

Harm to the NYU Community \nCourts have long emphasized the importance of promoting diversity and freedom in \neducational environments, recognizing that, due to the classroom’s vital role as a “marketplace \nof ideas,” constitutional protections are “nowhere more vital than in the community of American \nschools.”  Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967).  “The \nnation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of \nideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of \nauthoritative selection.”  Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).   \nDiversity similarly “helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables [students] to \nbetter understand” those with different backgrounds.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 330 \n(2003).  As a result, diversity in education fosters the “skills needed in today’s increasingly \nglobal marketplace” by “expos[ing] [students] to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and \nviewpoints.”  Id. at 330; see also Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603.  Recognizing these benefits, the \nSupreme Court has held that the Constitution protects a school’s “right to select those students \nwho will contribute the most to the ‘robust exchange of ideas . . . .’”  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. \nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 313 (1978); see also Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411, \n2417 (2013) (recognizing compelling governmental interest in “the educational benefits that flow \nfrom a diverse student body”); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1159 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(recognizing a school’s ability to assert harm on behalf of its students, including harm to the \nuniversity’s ability to accomplish its global mission). \nUniversities around the country have recognized the benefits that come with the unique \nperspective offered by DACA students.  These students are passionate and driven to excel.  As \n                                                                                                                                                             \nby animus towards individuals who are of Mexican national origin, as reflected in President Trump’s own \nstatements about Latinos and Mexicans.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 27 PageID #: 6698\n \nNYU President Hamilton and 700 other college and university presidents wrote, since DACA \nbegan, “we have seen the critical benefits of this program for our students, and the highly \npositive impacts on our institutions and communities.  DACA beneficiaries on our campuses \nhave been exemplary student scholars and student leaders, working across campus and in the \ncommunity.”19  The DHS Memorandum threatens the constitutionally-protected benefits of \ndiversity that have been realized through DACA.  See Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2417; Grutter, 539 \nU.S. at 328 (observing that a school’s “educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its \neducational mission is one to which we defer”); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313; see also Bery v. City of \nN.Y., 97 F.3d 689, 694 (2d Cir. 1996) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”) (quoting \n11 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948, at 440 (1973)).  \nThe DHS Memorandum would deprive NYU’s campuses of DACA beneficiaries’ unique \nperspectives; all students suffer when the diversity of ideas and backgrounds to which they are \nexposed is diminished.  See Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2417.  Forcing NYU’s undocumented students \nto retreat into the shadows will harm the University and the community it serves.   \nIf allowed to stand, the DHS Memorandum would also have the detrimental effect of \ndeterring young, undocumented immigrants from pursuing higher education opportunities, \nincluding at NYU.  An integral part of “the business of a university [is] to provide that \natmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment, and creation.”  Bakke, 438 U.S. \nat 312 (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring \nin judgment)).

Harm to Educational Interests of DACA Beneficiaries at NYU \nApart from the harm to NYU, implementing the DHS Memorandum would of course \nstrip away the educational opportunities that DACA provides at NYU and elsewhere—of which \nDACA beneficiaries have taken full advantage.  One of DACA’s overarching objectives was to \nfoster educational opportunities for young immigrants.  As President Obama noted in remarks \ngiven contemporaneously with its implementation, DACA beneficiaries are “young people who \nstudy in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they’re friends with our kids, they pledge \nallegiance to our flag.”20  Often, DACA beneficiaries had “no idea that [they were] \nundocumented until they appl[ied] for a job or a driver’s license, or a college scholarship.”  Id.  \nDACA was put in place to improve the allocation of immigration enforcement resources, in \nrecognition of the fact that “students who are earning their education,” and who pose no risk to \nnational security or public safety, deserve to have the chance to pursue their intellectual goals in \nthis country.  Id.   \nThe importance of education to DACA recipients is underscored by the fact that the \npursuit of education is one of the threshold requirements for DACA eligibility.  Among the \nrequirements to be eligible for DACA is that the individual “currently [be] in school, ha[ve] \ngraduated from high school, ha[ve] obtained a general education development certificate, or [be] \nan honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States.”21  \n                                                 \n20 See Office of the Press Secretary, Remarks by the President on Immigration, The White House \n(Archives), June 15, 2012, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-\nimmigration.  \n21 See Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, Sec’y of DHS, to David Y. Aguilar, Acting Comm’r, CBP, et \nal., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children at 1 \n(June 15, 2012).   \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 27 PageID #: 6700\n \nIndeed, a recent national survey of DACA recipients found that a staggering 94% of survey \nrespondents who were currently in school stated that they “pursued educational opportunities that \n[they] previously could not” because of DACA.22  One study showed that 45% of survey \nrespondents overall were currently in school.  Id.  Among those in school, 72% were pursuing a \nbachelor’s degree or higher.  Id.  Approximately 241,000 DACA-eligible students had enrolled \nin college as of 2014.23  The number has surely increased since.  Thus, in addition to \nmeaningfully contributing to the institutions they attend and to the education of their fellow \nstudents, DACA directly leads to hundreds of thousands of educated young men and women \nentering the workforce where they make positive contributions to society. \nThese results stand in stark contrast to the circumstances of most undocumented \nimmigrants, who end their schooling before entering college.24  “Due to a combination of scarce \nfamily resources, exclusion from financial aid at the state and federal levels, and depressed \nmotivations, the majority of unauthorized students pursuing higher education attend community \ncolleges and struggle to persist and graduate.”  Id.  But with DACA, which allows for legal \nemployment and diminished fear of deportation, many DACA beneficiaries report newfound \nmotivation and much greater success.  Id. \n                                                 \n22 See Tom K.

DACA works in tandem with NYU’s own core values, allowing \nNYU to support undocumented immigrant students who were brought to the United States as \nchildren and who wish to pursue their education in a safe and welcoming environment.25  The \npassion for learning and desire to contribute to society that DACA students exhibit makes NYU \na stronger institution, and makes the entire NYU community a better place. \nWhile it is no surprise that educators recognize the benefits of enrolling DACA \nbeneficiaries, they are far from the only ones who see the positive impact the program has had on \neducation in the United States and on DACA beneficiaries in particular.  Numerous members of \nCongress—from both parties—have spoken out against DHS’s decision to rescind DACA \nwithout a legislative or regulatory replacement in place, and have highlighted the educational \nbenefits that DACA, or a path to citizenship for undocumented children, would provide.  Senator \nJeff Flake recognized the need “to lawfully ensure that children who were brought here . . . by \ntheir parents, through no fault of their own, are able to stay and finish their education and \ncontinue to contribute to society.”26  Senator Thom Tillis described his vision for legislation that \nprovided a “path . . . to earn legal status” tied to a requirement to “pursue higher education.”27  \nAnd U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen wrote that the administration’s decision to end \nDACA was “heartbreaking, reckless and wrong.  For too long, Dreamers have been living with \nfear and unable to plan their futures.  DACA was necessary to provide a migratory safe harbor \n                                                 \n25 See Elizabeth A.

DACA Is A Constitutional Program \nWhile DACA has been politically controversial since its inception, its creation was well \nwithin the bounds of both the Constitution and DHS’s authority.  Since its creation in 2002, DHS \nhas had the express authority to “[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies and \npriorities.”  See 6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  As part of the Executive Branch, it has significant discretion \nin exercising its authority, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952), \nincluding in exercising its removal powers, see Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 \n(2012) (discussing the “broad discretion” possessed by immigration officials). \nAt its heart, DACA is a program of resource allocation.  More than 11 million \nundocumented immigrants currently live in the United States, yet Congress only provides \nresources for the removal of approximately 400,000 undocumented immigrants each year.29  As a \nresult, DHS has historically prioritized the removal of “those who represent threats to national \nsecurity, public safety, and border security.”  See Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 \n(2015).  \nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) defines “deferred \naction” as “a discretionary determination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of \nprosecutorial discretion.”30  It is “an act of administrative convenience to the government which \n                                                 \n28 Press Release: Ros-Lehtinen Statement on Elimination of DACA, https://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-\nrelease/ros-lehtinen-statement-elimination-daca (Sept. 5, 2017). \n29 See Ian Millhiser, DACA is Not Unconstitutional (Sep. 5, 2017), https://thinkprogress.org/trump-admin-\nconstitutional-case-daca-a3134e0059e3/.   \n30 See Frequently Asked Questions – DHS DACA FAQs, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-\nquestions.   \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 27 PageID #: 6703\n \ngives some cases lower priority.”31  Thus, DHS’s election to enforce removal laws against some \nundocumented immigrants but not against others is well within its discretion, and is merely a \nform of “deferred action.”  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985) (holding that “an \nagency’s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or criminal process, is a \ndecision generally committed to an agency’s absolute discretion”).  Deferred action is not unique \nto DACA, but has been applied in a number of other immigration contexts, including with \nrespect to survivors of domestic violence, victims of human trafficking, and surviving spouses of \nU.S. citizens.32 \nBecause deportation takes place through removal proceedings, DHS’s determination \nwhether to bring proceedings against an individual is effectively an exercise in prosecutorial \ndiscretion.33  In the case of DACA, DHS determined that, for individuals who met specified \nprerequisites, including the lack of a significant criminal history34 and the requisite educational \nor military status, it would favorably exercise its discretion to de-prioritize removal of those \nindividuals. \nThe Obama administration’s decision to extend certain benefits to DACA beneficiaries, \nsuch as the ability to obtain a social security card, was similarly lawful.  Immigration statutes and \nrules have long included carveouts to make those subject to deferred action eligible for such \nbenefits.  For example, regulations promulgated in 1981 outlining the “classes of aliens \n                                                 \n31 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). \n32 See Michael Tan, DACA Is And Always Will Be Constitutional (Aug. 15, 2017), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/road-citizenship/daca-and-will-always-be-constitutional \n33 See Understanding Prosecutorial Discretion in Immigration Law (May 26, 2011), \nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/understanding-prosecutorial-discretion-immigration-law \n34 Undocumented individuals who have been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or \nmore other misdemeanors are prohibited from receiving benefits under DACA.  See Memorandum, supra n.21, at 1.   \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 27 PageID #: 6704\n \nauthorized to accept employment” include “an alien who has been granted deferred action.”35  In \n1986, Congress also enacted a comprehensive scheme that prohibits the employment of “illegal \naliens,” but includes an exception for non-citizens who are “authorized to be employed . . . by \nthe Attorney General”—authority that was thereafter transferred to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.36  The Supreme Court has applied similar standards when assessing an agency’s \ndiscretionary authority in the immigration context.  In Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292 (1993), the \nCourt considered an Immigration and Naturalization Service policy that “juvenile aliens” \ndetained without their parents could not be released to other “responsible adults.”  It held that \napplying additional rules to a seemingly “blanket” policy provided sufficient “particularization” \nto allow for the constitutional exercise of discretion.  Id. at 314-15.  DACA’s benefits, which \ninclude the ability to get a driver’s license, to obtain employment and have access to health \nbenefits, and ultimately to live without fear of removal, are all similarly lawful benefits conferred \nupon individuals who have attained deferred-action status. \nIV.  The Termination of DACA Violated the Administrative Procedure Act \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) outlines the procedures that federal agencies \nmust follow when promulgating, amending or repealing a rule.  DHS’s termination of DACA \nfailed to comply with these requirements in two ways.  First, DHS failed to demonstrate that its \ndecision to repeal DACA was the product of reasoned decision-making, rendering it arbitrary \nand capricious under the APA.  Second, despite significantly altering DACA beneficiaries’ \nexisting legal rights, the DACA repeal failed to comply with the notice and comment procedures \nthat the APA prescribes for substantive rules.   \n                                                 \n35 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). \n36 See Millhiser, supra n.29.   \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 22 of 27 PageID #: 6705\n \nA.  DHS’s Decision to Terminate DACA Was Arbitrary and Capricious Under the \nAPA \nGovernmental agencies are accorded significant latitude in administering the programs \nfor which they are responsible, but they do not have unfettered discretion to rescind their own \nrules.  Rather, “[i]n all cases” a rule rescission—like a rule promulgation—is invalid under the \nAPA if it is “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 \nU.S. 402, 416 (1971) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)); see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 41 (1983) (noting that the APA’s arbitrary-and-\ncapricious test applies equally to rule promulgations and to rule rescissions).  Such an action is \nonly valid if the agency supplies a “reasoned analysis for the change,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n42, including a consideration of all “relevant factors,” Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416.  Thus, a \nrule rescission is “arbitrary and capricious if the agency has . . . entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.   \nIn terminating DACA, DHS failed to supply even a cursory analysis of several important \nconsiderations.  For example, the DHS Memorandum failed to address the basic rationale \nunderlying the DACA program: the use of prosecutorial discretion to focus limited agency \nresources on high-priority cases.  Nor did DHS address the legal justification for the exercise of \nsuch discretion, i.e., the Secretary of Homeland Security’s express statutory authority to \n“[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  \nFinally—and of particular importance to amicus curiae—DHS entirely ignored its earlier policy \ndeterminations regarding the promotion of education and of DACA recipients’ contributions to \nsociety.  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA specifically noted that U.S. immigration law is \nnot designed to remove such “productive young people,” many of whom “have already \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 23 of 27 PageID #: 6706\n \ncontributed to our country in significant ways.”37  That the DHS Memorandum failed to mention, \nlet alone substantively address these goals when it terminated DACA and upended the lives of \nnearly a million people, many of whom are students, demonstrates the arbitrary and capricious \nnature of DHS’s action. \nIf anything, DHS was obligated in this context to supply a “more detailed justification \nthan what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.”  FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  When an agency’s policy has created “serious reliance \ninterests,” the agency must provide a “reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and \ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. at 516 (citing Smiley v. \nCitibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996)).  There are few reliance interests more \nsubstantial than those of DACA beneficiaries, who have built their entire lives upon the premise \nthat they can live openly and legally within the United States, and attend school, work and travel, \ndue to their DACA status.  In eradicating that premise and throwing the lives of DACA \nbeneficiaries into utter disarray, DHS was, at a minimum, obligated to explain in detail—\ncertainly beyond expressing the mere desire to avoid a lawsuit—its justification for ignoring the \nfacts and circumstances that led to DACA’s implementation in the first place.  See Fox, 556 U.S. \nat 516.   \nFinally, to the limited extent DHS supplied any explanation for its decision to repeal \nDACA, that explanation is both legally flawed and incoherent.  According to the DHS \nMemorandum, DHS cannot grant deferred-action status to immigrants who arrive in the U.S. \nbefore age 16 because Congress supposedly has not authorized the practice.38  At the same time, \nthe Memorandum provides that DHS will continue renewing applications for deferrals over the \n                                                 \n37 Memorandum, supra n.21, at 2.   \n38 See DHS Memorandum, supra. \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 24 of 27 PageID #: 6707\n \nnext month, allowing eligible immigrants to remain in the country for another two years.  Id.  In \nshort, DHS asserts that it can keep doing what it erroneously claims it lacks statutory authority to \ndo.  This “internally inconsistent and inadequately explained” analysis, General Chemical Corp. \nv. United States, 817 F.2d 844, 857 (D.C. Cir. 1987), falls “somewhere on the distant side of \narbitrary.”  Central Florida Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, 598 F.2d 37, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1978). \nB.  DHS’s DACA Termination Failed to Comply with the APA’s Notice-and-\nComment Procedures \nWith certain narrow exceptions, the APA requires that agencies engaged in rulemaking—\nwhich includes repealing an existing rule—provide notice and an opportunity for public \ncomment.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c); see also id. § 551(5) (defining “rulemaking” to include \nboth promulgating and repealing a rule).  Section 553’s notice-and-comment provisions apply to \n“substantive” or “legislative” rules, Time Warner Cable Inc. v. FCC, 729 F.3d 137, 168 (2d Cir. \n2013) (citation omitted), not to “interpretive rules” or “general statements of policy,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(A).  Whether a rule is substantive turns not on its label, but on whether it in fact \n“create[s] new law, right[s], or duties.”  N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp. v. Saranac Power \nPartners, L.P., 267 F.3d 128, 131 (2d Cir. 2001); see Donovan v. Red Star Marine Servs., Inc., \n739 F.2d 774, 783 (2d Cir. 1984) (stating that substantive rules “changed existing rights and \nobligations”). \nHere, the revocation of deferred-action status unquestionably significantly alters DACA \nbeneficiaries’ legal rights.  See Saranac Power, 267 F.3d at 131.  For example, DACA recipients \nmay obtain social security numbers and photo identification cards, which in turn enables them to \napply for financial aid and to secure credit to fund education-related expenses.  DACA recipients \nalso are eligible for work authorization, which enables them to work their way through school \nand to secure legitimate jobs following graduation.  Further in the future, DACA recipients are \n19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 27 PageID #: 6708\n \neligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits.  DHS’s termination of DACA revokes \nrecipients’ eligibility for these and other benefits on a non-discretionary, categorical basis.  \nAccordingly, DHS’ decision to rescind DACA was a substantive rule to which § 553’s notice-\nand-comment requirements apply.  By rendering its decision in the DHS Memorandum with no \npublic notice or comment, DHS failed to adhere to these basic requirements and thus violated the \nAPA.  Cf. Texas, 809 F.3d at 170 (holding that states should have an opportunity to be heard, via \nnotice and comment, on DAPA’s substantive grant of lawful presence and eligibility for \nbenefits).39   \nV.  The Failure to Issue An Analysis of the DACA Termination’s Impact On Small \nEntities Violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act \nUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), all federal \nagencies, as part of the rulemaking process, must conduct a “regulatory flexibility analysis” for \nany rule that has “a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 605(b).  In an initial analysis, an agency must, among other things, describe the effects \nof a proposed rule on small businesses, discuss “significant alternatives” that would “minimize \nany significant economic impact of the rule” on small businesses, and explain “why each one of \nsuch alternatives was rejected.”  Id. § 604(a)(3); see id. § 603 (describing the “initial regulatory \nflexibility analysis”).  When promulgating a final rule, the agency must publish a final analysis \nfor public comment.  See id. § 4.  An agency must, at a minimum, make a “reasonable, good-\nfaith effort” to comply with these requirements.  Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127 \nF.3d 104, 114 (1st Cir. 1997).   \n                                                 \n39 “DAPA” stands for “Deferred Actions for Parents of Americans,” a program created in 2014 to provide a \npath to citizenship for certain immigrants whose children are American citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents.  \nSee Texas, 809 F.3d at 146-47.  On June 15, 2017, then-Secretary Kelly rescinded the DAPA program in its entirety.  \nSee John Kelly, Rescission of Memorandum Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents (June 15, 2017), available at https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/06/15/rescission-memorandum-\nproviding-deferred-action-parents-americans-and-lawful. \n20 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 26 of 27 PageID #: 6709\n \nAs an initial matter, the DACA repeal is certain to have a significant impact on small \nbusinesses.  DACA recipients who have obtained work authorization are not only employed at \nthousands of small businesses, but they are entrepreneurs who start small businesses.  Indeed, \nimmigrants such as DACA beneficiaries are twice as likely to start a business as the average \nperson,40 making them significant drivers of job creation and contributors to the country’s \neconomic vitality.  Repealing DACA, therefore, will cause a significant reduction in the \ncountry’s workforce as well as shutter small business entities whose owners require deferred-\naction status to stay in business.  DHS, however, did not even mention these impacts, much less \ndiscuss “significant alternatives” to repealing DACA, as the RFA requires.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 604(a)(3).  In short, DHS failed to make a “good-faith effort” to comply with the RFA’s \nrequirements.  See Associated Fisheries, 127 F.3d at 114.  Accordingly, the DACA repeal \nviolates the RFA.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, DHS’s decision to terminate DACA via the DHS \nMemorandum is unlawful, and will impair important interests of DACA beneficiaries as well as \neducational institutions, including NYU.  Implementation of the DHS Memorandum should \ntherefore be enjoined and the DACA program reinstated in full. \n   \n                                                 \n40 See Tom K. Wong et al., New Study of DACA Beneficiaries Shows Positive Economic and Educational \nOutcomes, Center for American Progress (Oct. 18, 2017), available at https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.\norg/research/value-added-immigrants-create-jobs-and-businesses-boost-wages-native-born-workers. \n21 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 164   Filed 12/22/17   Page 27 of 27 PageID #: 6710\n \nDated: December 22, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nOF COUNSEL:  PROSKAUER ROSE LLP \n \nTerrance Nolan  By:   /s/ Steven E.

Amici are keenly aware of the role \nthat discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and nationality has played in this nation’s \nhistory. Amici have a special interest in ensuring that the Court has the benefit of their expertise \nwhen it draws its conclusions with regard to the role that animus may have played in the decision \nto rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Amici have reviewed \nthe Declaration of Dr. Stephen Pitti submitted in support of the instant legal challenge brought by \nNew York and fourteen other states and the District of Columbia, No. 1:17-cv-5229, Dkt. 97-2, \nEx. 38 (Pitti Decl.). After reviewing his Declaration, amici agree that Dr. Pitti used research \nmethods that are widely accepted as valid in the field of history. These methods include a \nspecific interpretive methodology that looks at public discourse to discern the use of racially \ncoded expressions or code words by government officials, politicians, and members of the public \nto advance discriminatory political objectives. Amici agree with Dr. Pitti’s summative opinion:  \nWhen properly understood within the context of the history and contemporary \ndiscrimination directed against Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Latinos, . . . President \nTrump and others who worked for his campaign and in his Administration have long \nexpressed animus towards ethnic Mexicans and other Latinos. President Trump and others \nassociated with his presidential campaign and Administration have drawn upon and used \nracial code words, and have benefitted from racism against Latinos. Racial animus against \nethnic Mexicans shaped their decision to terminate DACA. \n \nPitti Decl. ¶ 17, Dkt. 97-2 at 14.  \nThe Fred T. Korematsu Center for Law and Equality (“Korematsu Center”) is a non-profit \norganization based at the Seattle University School of Law.

Inspired by the legacy of Fred \nKorematsu, who defied military orders during World War II that ultimately led to the unlawful \nincarceration of 120,000 Japanese Americans, the Korematsu Center works to advance social \njustice for all. The Korematsu Center has a special interest in addressing government action \ntargeted at classes of persons based on race, nationality, or religion. The Korematsu Center has \ndeveloped an expertise with regard to the use of racial code words in its role as co-counsel to \nhigh school students who successfully challenged a facially neutral Arizona statute that was \nenacted and enforced to terminate the Mexican American Studies Program in the Tucson Unified \nSchool District. González v. Douglas, No. CV 10-623 TUC AWT, 2017 WL 3611658 (D. Ariz., \nAug. 22, 2017). In addition, the Korematsu Center is keenly aware of the use of direct and \nracially coded language used to justify the discriminatory treatment of Japanese Americans \nbefore, during, and after World War II. Drawing on its experience and expertise, the Korematsu \nCenter seeks to ensure that courts understand the way that racially coded language is used to \nachieve discriminatory outcomes.3 \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nHistory teaches us that the institution of slavery, the dispossession and removal of Native \nAmericans, the exclusion of Asian immigrants, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during \nWorld War II, and the mass repatriation and deportation of persons of Mexican ancestry were not \naccidents but instead were the product of deliberate decisions made by government officials. The \nhistorical record demonstrates that these decisions were informed by an explicit racial ideology \nthat defined groups along racial lines; that justified discriminatory treatment based on notions of \ngroup superiority/inferiority and group desirability/undesirability; and that often posed the \n                                                 \n3 The Korematsu Center does not, in this brief or otherwise, represent the official views of Seattle University. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 10 of 30 PageID #: 6509\n \ndiscriminatory treatment as necessary for the security of the nation and for the prosperity of its \ncitizenry. \nDuring earlier periods, government officials, politicians, and members of the public \nexpressed, much more nakedly, this racial ideology used to justify and advance discrimination. \nAs social norms changed and it became, increasingly, less acceptable to express publicly these \nsame sentiments, racially coded language was used by politicians to garner public support and \ngain elected office and by government officials to justify and advance discriminatory political \nobjectives. Historians and other academics have observed and documented this phenomenon, the \nshift from explicit racial language to coded racial expressions. Examination of public discourse \nfor the use of code words has become a widely accepted interpretive methodology used by \nhistorians and other academics to discern the role that discrimination may have played with \nregard to particular events, as well as for the broader course of United States history. \nHistory is replete with examples in which explicit and coded language has been used to \njustify and advance discrimination against a particular group. During severe economic \ndownturns, populist leaders and politicians exploited racial nativism to scapegoat outsider \nimmigrant groups who were blamed for taking away the rightful opportunities of an anxious \ncitizenry.4 During the 1880s, the Chinese were blamed; during the 1920s, racialized white ethnic \ngroups from southern and eastern Europe as well as immigrants from Asia were blamed; and \nduring the height of the Great Depression in the 1930s, migrants from Mexico were blamed.5 In \neach instance, targeted anti-immigrant sentiment led to the various Chinese Exclusion Acts, the \n                                                 \n4 See generally JOHN HIGHAM, STRANGERS IN THE LAND: PATTERNS OF AMERICAN NATIVISM, 1860-1925 (rev. ed. \n2002). \n5 See generally ALEXANDER SAXTON, THE INDISPENSABLE ENEMY: LABOR AND THE ANTI-CHINESE MOVEMENT IN \nCALIFORNIA (1975); HIGHAM, supra note 4; FRANCISCO E.

Understanding how government officials, politicians, \nand members of the public used the word “wetback,” along with notions of threat to national \nsecurity and national prosperity, in the period leading up to Operation Wetback provides an \ninstructive example for understanding how various code words operate today with regard to \nimmigration enforcement, including the decision to rescind DACA. \nFurther, Operation Wetback is particularly relevant because in November 2015 then-\ncandidate Donald Trump invoked the 1954 deportation program, without using its name, as a \nsuccessful model that he would seek to emulate.8 Though the rescission of DACA does not, at \n                                                 \n6 See LUCY SALYER, LAWS HARSH AS TIGERS: CHINESE IMMIGRANTS AND THE SHAPING OF MODERN IMMIGRATION \nLAW 6-23 (1995) (discussing anti-Chinese sentiment and the various Chinese Exclusion Acts); MAI NGAI, \nIMPOSSIBLE SUBJECTS: ILLEGAL ALIENS AND ALIEN CITIZENS 18-54 (discussing the impetus of the Immigration Act \nof 1924) and 71-75 (discussing anti-Mexican hostility and the 1930s mass deportations). \n7 BALDERRAMA & RODRÍGUEZ, supra note 5, at 216; NGAI, supra note 6, at 72. \n8 Philip Bump, Donald Trump Endorsed “Operation Wetback” – But Not by Name, WASH.

Promising to emulate this mass deportation program while omitting its name is \nitself an example of a camouflaged expression—an example of how, during the campaign and \nafter the election, President Trump employed racially coded expressions or “code words,” \nlanguage that evinces and appeals to racial animus and is intended to invoke racial fear but which \npermits plausible deniability that the speech is about race. His use of these code words while \nseeking elected office and after assuming the presidency presents strong evidence of animus.9 \nTo assist the court in analyzing whether Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection and Administrative \nProcedure Act claims merit preliminary injunctive relief, and more specifically in assessing the \nweight to be given to the Declaration of Dr. Stephen Pitti, Amici historians and the Fred T. \nKorematsu Center for Law and Equality submit this amicus brief to demonstrate that racial \nanimus can be discerned by a code word analysis, and that such an analysis is a widely accepted \nmethodology in the field of history. Further, a survey of federal circuit courts demonstrates that \ncode word analysis has been adopted into legal frameworks as providing important direct and \ncircumstantial evidence supporting a showing of animus or discriminatory intent.  \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs’ claims in this litigation have alleged that President Trump’s decision to rescind \nDACA was motivated by animus toward Mexicans, and more generally towards Latinos, in \nviolation of the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). See Third \nAm. Compl., Batalla Vidal, et al. v.

Compl., State of New York, et al., v. Trump, et al., No. 1:17-cv-05228, Dkt. 54 at 69, \n71-72. Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction on their equal protection claim, \narguing that “Defendants’ termination of DACA violates Equal Protection because it was \nmotivated by animus toward Latinos and Defendants’ stated reasons for their action are baseless \nand illogical.” Dkt. 96-1 at 16. Plaintiffs have also moved for a preliminary injunction on their \nAPA claims, arguing that the true basis for terminating DACA is animus toward Latinos, who \nmake up 93% of DACA grantees. Id. at 13. To support the animus arguments, Plaintiffs have \ncited Defendants’ use of racial code words. Id. at 14-15. \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they will suffer \nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief and either (1) that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of the action, or (2) that there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to \nmake them a fair ground for litigation, provided that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in \nfavor of the moving party. Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master \nFund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 34–35 (2d Cir. 2010). In support of Plaintiffs’ equal protection and true \nbasis APA claims, Amici demonstrate that code word analysis is an accepted historical \nmethodology for discerning racial animus and an accepted category of evidence that both the \nSecond Circuit and other circuits have used to discern animus in equal protection claims and in \nother contexts in which discriminatory intent must be shown.  \nOf special note is the Second Circuit’s recent observation and admonition that “[b]ecause \ndiscriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof, a district court facing a question of \ndiscriminatory intent must make ‘a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence \nof intent as may be available.’” MHANY Mgmt., Inc. v. Cnty. of Nassau, 819 F.3d 581, 606 (2d \nCir. 2016) (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 \n  6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 14 of 30 PageID #: 6513\n \n(1977)). This sensitive inquiry examines the following non-exhaustive factors: \n•  whether “[t]he impact of the official action . . . bears more heavily on one race than \nanother”; \n•  “[t]he historical background of the decision . . . particularly if it reveals a series of \nofficial actions taken for invidious purposes”; \n•  “[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence”; \n•  “[s]ubstantive departures”; and \n•  “[t]he legislative or administrative history . . . especially where there are \ncontemporary statements made by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of \nits meetings, or reports.” \n \nMHANY, 819 F.3d at 606 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68). \nIt is indisputable that the rescission of DACA falls most heavily on persons of Mexican \nancestry, who make up 79.4% of DACA recipients.10 Further, as Plaintiffs demonstrate in their \nrespective APA claims, the decision to rescind DACA was plagued by a host of procedural and \nsubstantive departures. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ [Batalla Vidal et al.] \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, 1:16-cv-04756, Dkt. 123-1, at 26-28; State of New York et al. \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff States’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 1:17-cv-\n05228, Dkt. 96-1, at 12-20. Added to this, a sensitive inquiry into the historical background of \nthe decision to rescind DACA, especially the contemporaneous statements made by \ndecisionmakers, makes code word analysis especially important when examining facially neutral \ngovernmental action under an Arlington Heights analysis to determine discriminatory intent. See \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68. The existence of discriminatory intent is pertinent to both \nthe equal protection and APA claims, including that the existence of animus strongly supports a \nfinding of pretext or bad faith. \n                                                 \n10 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., Approximate Active DACA Recipients: Country of Birth (As of Sept. 4, \n2017) 1, https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20 \nForms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_population_data.pdf.  \n  7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 15 of 30 PageID #: 6514\n \nI.  History Is Replete with Instances In Which Racially Coded Expressions Have \nStrongly Evidenced Animus, Such As “Wetback,” Used During the Mass \nRepatriation and Deportation of Persons of Mexican Ancestry in 1954. \nOperation Wetback. That was the official name given by the program undertaken in 1954 to \nforcibly repatriate hundreds of thousands of Mexican migrants.11 The massive scope of the \nprogram and lack of procedural safeguards resulted in many Americans citizens of Mexican \nancestry being swept up in its dragnet and removed to remote areas of Mexico.12 In addition to \nthose detained and deported, hundreds of thousands of Mexican migrants left voluntarily in order \nto avoid brutal conditions endured by those detained and forcibly removed. The decision to \ninstitute this mass deportation program was informed by the use of the racially coded expression, \n“wetback.” \nViewed from today’s perspective, many might say that “wetback” is not racially coded \nlanguage, but rather an explicit expression of animus. While “wetback” may today be recognized \nas an epithet or slur, that was certainly not the case in the 1950s. The original mundaneness of \nthe term “wetback” is evidenced in a 1950 Sunday edition of the New York Times, which \nincluded in its “Fifteen News Questions,” the following question: “’Wetbacks’ were reported last \nweek to be entering California at a rate of 10,000 a month. What are ‘wetbacks’?” The answer is \nsupplied several pages later: “Mexican immigrants who cross the border by stealth to seek work. \nThe term ‘wetback’ was originally applied to Mexicans who entered the U.S. farther east by \nswimming the Rio Grande.”13 It is of note that the New York Times did not ask “Who are \n                                                 \n11 See JUAN RAMÓN GARCÍA, OPERATION WETBACK: THE MASS DEPORTATION OF MEXICAN UNDOCUMENTED \nWORKERS IN 1954, at 228 (1980); see also 150,000 “Wetbacks” Taken in Round-Up, N.Y.

President Harry \nTruman used the term in precisely this way in his July 13, 1951, address to Congress that called \nfor a more comprehensive solution to address “the steady stream of illegal immigrants from \nMexico, the so-called ‘wetbacks,’ who cross the Rio Grande or the western stretches of our long \nborder.”14 Likewise, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, getting ready to run for president in 1951, \nin private correspondence with Senator William Fulbright “quoted a report in the New York \nTimes,” and highlighted a paragraph that discussed “[t]he rise in illegal border-crossing by \nMexican ‘wetbacks.’”15 \nThough there is no record of President Eisenhower using the term in public, he responded to \nquestions from reporters who used the term and affirmed his support of legislation intended to \naddress what the press characterized as the “wetback problem.”16 Further, he did use the term at \nleast once in his personal diaries.17 And members of his administration, including the two \nprimary architects of Operation Wetback, General Joseph Swing who became the Commissioner \nof Immigration and Naturalization in 1954 and Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr., both \n                                                 \n14 President Harry S.

Further, this term does \nnot accurately describe those whose backs did not literally get wet from crossing the border, yet \nit stands in as a metonym for all unauthorized border crossers from Mexico, and eventually \nbecame a term that is used by some for all Mexican migrants and Mexican Americans. Historians \ntoday, employing code word analysis, would draw the conclusion that the direct use of the term \nby President Truman, the private use and public acquiescence to the term by President \nEisenhower, and the repeated use by members of Eisenhower’s administration is strong evidence \nof animus that may have affected government policies and immigration enforcement. \n                                                 \n18 See, e.g., Drive on Wetbacks Termed a Success, N.Y.

Code Word Analysis Is a Widely Accepted Methodology that Historians Employ \nto Discern Racial Animus and Give Context to Government Action. \nWhile the use of “wetback” in the 1950s presents an easier case of discerning racially coded \nexpressions, code word analysis becomes increasingly important when political strategists \nrecognize the need to develop code words whose racial character is less obvious. The most \nexplicit description is provided in a surprisingly candid confession by Republican political \nstrategist Lee Atwater in 1981: \nYou start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say \n“nigger” – that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like . . . forced busing, states’ \nrights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting \ntaxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a \nbyproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites . . . “We want to cut this,” is \nmuch more abstract than even the busing thing . . . and a hell of a lot more abstract than \n“Nigger, nigger.”22 \n \nAs Dr. Stephen Pitti sets forth in his Declaration: \nHistorians and other academic experts recognize that animus does not require explicit, \npublic declarations of racial ideology that racism has persisted across the centuries. An \nattention to history and careful analysis of the use of coded racial appeals in \ncontemporary political discourse provide the keys to understanding the links between \nracial animus and politics in the twenty-first century. \n \nPitti Decl. ¶ 20, No. 1:17-cv-05228, Dkt. 97-2 at 15. \nThis understanding and appreciation of the operation of code words by historians is \nprecisely the reason the analysis and expert opinions expressed by historians examining current \nevents can be helpful to the Court, especially when they are able to demonstrate how careful \nstudy of certain past events may inform our understanding of current events. \n \n                                                 \n22 Rick Perlstein, Exclusive: Lee Atwater’s Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy, THE NATION, Nov. \n13, 2012, https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/.  \n  11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 19 of 30 PageID #: 6518\n \nIII.  Courts Routinely Recognize the Evidentiary Value of Coded Language in \nDiscerning Racial Animus. \nCourts have come to rely on code words as evidence in determining whether alleged \ndiscriminatory acts are racially motivated. Unlike times past, today people are rarely explicit \nabout their intent or motivation in expressing or acting on racial bias. The Second Circuit has \nrecognized this evolution: \n“Anti-discrimination laws and lawsuits have ‘educated’ would-be violators such that \nextreme manifestations of discrimination are thankfully rare… Regrettably, however, this \nin no way suggests that discrimination based upon an individual’s race, gender or age is \nnear an end. Discrimination continues to pollute the social and economic mainstream of \nAmerican life, and is often simply masked in more subtle forms.” . . . “[R]acially charged \ncode words may provide evidence of discriminatory intent by sending a clear message \nand carrying the distinct tone of racial motivations and implications.” \n \nMHANY, 819 F.3d at 609 (quoting, respectively, Aman v. Cort. Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d \n1074, 1081-82 (3d Cir. 1996) and Smith v. Fairview Ridges Hosp. 625 F.3d 1076, 1085 (8th Cir. \n2010), abrogated on other grounds by Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031 (8th Cir. \n2011)) (citations omitted).  \nIn MHANY, plaintiffs alleged disparate treatment under the Fair Housing Act and Equal \nProtection Clause based, in part, on code word evidence.

Knowing that this was likely to increase \nthe number of people of color in the community, the residents raised concerns about how the \ndevelopment would impact the “character” and “flavor” of the community.

They were \nalso vocal about potential negative impacts on traffic and schools, despite studies showing that \n  12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 30 PageID #: 6519\n \ntraffic would decrease from current levels and that multi-family housing was likely to result in \nfewer children than the single family housing the dissenters were advocating for. Id. at 590-95. \nResidents worried that this community would become similar to other nearby majority-minority \ncommunities, id. at 594, and one urged the officials to “just keep Garden City what it is,” id. at \n596. After the barrage of complaints, the officials abruptly changed course, capitulating to the \ndemands of community members that the site be zoned for single family housing only. Id. at \n596-97. The court upheld the trial court’s finding that “citizen opposition to [multi-family] \nzoning utilized code words to communicate their race-based animus to Garden City officials” \nand that “Garden City’s abrupt shift in zoning in the face of vocal citizen opposition to changing \nthe character of Garden City represented acquiescence to race-based animus.” Id. at 610-11.  \nThe District Court in Arizona recently held that public officials used code words with regard \nto Mexican Americans, and that this constituted evidence of discriminatory intent in violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause. Gonzalez, 2017 WL 3611658, at *16. In that case, plaintiffs \nsuccessfully claimed that a facially neutral Arizona statute used to eliminate a highly successful \nMexican American Studies program was the product of racial animus. The court noted that the \nofficials involved in the enactment and enforcement of the statute frequently used certain terms \nto stand in for Mexican Americans, such as “‘Raza,’ ‘un-American,’ ‘radical,’ ‘communist,’ \n‘Aztlán,’ and ‘M.E.Ch.A.’” Id. The court found these to be derogatory code words because they \n“[drew] on negative mischaracterizations that had little to no basis in fact,” and found that \n“[t]hese particular words were effective codewords with Arizona voters because they drew on \npeople‘s … concerns about illegal immigration’ and the ‘Mexicanization’ of Arizona that were \nprominent” at the time.

Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1067 n.12 (1st Cir. 1997) (“It is rare that \ndiscrimination wears its garb openly and it more often comes ‘masked in \nsubtle forms.’ Triers of fact may recognize those more subtle forms for \nwhat they are and coded comments may raise inferences of \ndiscrimination.”) (quoting Aman, 85 F.3d at 1082)); \n \nSecond Circuit:  MHANY, 819 F.3d at 608-12 (upholding district court’s finding that \nopponents used racially charged code words to communicate animus and \nthat city officials acquiesced to this animus in its shift in zoning);  \n \nThird Circuit:  Aman, 85 F.3d at 1082-83 (holding that use of “inherently racist” code \nwords can constitute evidence of a hostile work environment and an intent \nto discriminate);  \n \nFourth Circuit:  Smith v. Town of Clarkton, N.C., 682 F.2d 1055, 1066 (4th Cir. 1982) \n(concern evinced about the influx of “undesirables” and dilution of public \nschools and threat to public safety constituted “evidence … which in a \ndifferent context might not illustrate racial bigotry, but, against the \nbackground of the housing project in Clarkton and the considerable \nopposition to it, were interpreted by the trial court as ‘camouflaged’ racial \nexpressions”);  \n \nFifth Circuit:  Jenkins v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, Inc., 478 F.3d 255, 265 (5th Cir. \n2007) (recognizing that code words may provide basis of discriminatory \nintent);  \n \nSixth Circuit:  United States v.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Co., 537 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) (citation omitted). At least two Supreme Court justices have referenced the concept of code words as a mask \nfor racial discrimination. See City of Memphis v.

Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 236 (5th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 612 \n(2017). As the court reviewed the evidence “that could support a finding of discriminatory \nintent,” 830 F.3d at 235, it contrasted the stated purpose of SB 14—deterring “voter fraud”—\nwith evidence that the drafters and proponents likely knew of the law’s disproportionate effect on \n  15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 23 of 30 PageID #: 6522\n \nminorities, id. at 236. The Deputy General Counsel to the Lieutenant Governor testified that he \nsent an email “urg[ing] senators to emphasize the detection and deterrence of fraud and \nprotect[ing] public confidence in elections” as “the goal” of SB 14, “to remind people what the \npoint of the bill was” for their speeches on the floor of the Texas Senate. Id. at 236 n.19; see also \nid. at 288 n.17 (Jones, J., dissenting) (cataloguing statements of proponents of SB 14 about the \npurpose of the bill being to deter “voter fraud” and “protect the integrity of the ballot box”).  \nIn examining the stated purpose of deterring “voter fraud,” the court gave special attention to \nthe testimony from plaintiffs’ expert on race relations, a history professor, which placed the \n“voter fraud” language in historical context. Id. at 237 (noting the record showed that Texas has \na history of justifying voter suppression efforts such as the poll tax and literacy tests with the \nrace-neutral reason of promoting ballot integrity). The court quoted directly from the expert’s \ntestimony about the stated rationale for devices Texas had used to deny minorities the vote, \nincluding the all-White primary, the secret ballot, and the use of illiteracy, poll tax, re-\nregistration, and purging. Id.  \nQ  What, in your opinion, was the stated rationale for the enactment of all [-]White primaries \nin Texas? \nA  The stated rationale was voter fraud. \nQ  What was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for the use of secret ballot provisions in \nTexas? \nA  The stated rationale was to prevent voter fraud. \nQ  And what was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for the use of the poll tax in Texas? \nA  The stated rationale by the State was to prevent voter fraud. \nQ  And how about the stated rationale for the use in Texas of re-registration requirements \nand voter purges? \nA  The stated rationale was voter fraud. \nQ  Dr. Burton, in your expert opinion, did these devices actually respond to sincere concerns \nor incidents—incidences of voter fraud? \nA  No. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 24 of 30 PageID #: 6523\n \n \nId. The court remanded the discriminatory intent issue, instructing the trial court to reweigh the \nArlington Heights factors, noting “there is evidence that could support a finding that the \nLegislature’s race-neutral reason of ballot integrity offered by the State is pretextual,” id., and \nthat “there remains evidence to support a finding that the cloak of ballot integrity could be hiding \na more invidious purpose,” id. at 241; id. at 242 (remand). \nIV. A Sensitive Inquiry into the Historical Background of the Decision to Rescind \nDACA, with Particular Attention Paid to Contemporaneous Statements Made \nby Decisionmakers, Reveals the Use of Code Words Reflecting Animus Against \nPersons of Mexican Ancestry and Latinos. \nThe 96-page Expert Report of Stephen J. Pitti, No. 1:17-cv-05228, Dkt. 97-2 at 76-174 (“Pitti \nReport”), provides comprehensive documentation and analysis of contemporaneous statements \nmade by Donald Trump as candidate and as President as well as statements made by key advisers \nand administration officials, including Senator and later Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard \nSessions III and policy adviser Stephen Miller. Id. at 113-63. A comprehensive discourse \nanalysis issued Dec. 21, 2017, reviews 300 speeches and 5000 tweets of Donald Trump as \ncandidate and President. See The President’s Intent, supra note 9. Each finds numerous, \nconsistent, and persistent statements that are racially coded expressions and code words that \nprovide strong evidence of animus. Pitti Report, No. 1:17-cv-05228, Dkt. 97-2 at 113-63; The \nPresident’s Intent, supra note 9 at passim.  \nOf special note is the manner in which Trump talks about DACA recipients and the way he \ncontests and subverts the name by which they are commonly referred: “Dreamers.” On \nNovember 13, 2015, in a forum called the Sunshine Summit hosted by the Republican Party of \nFlorida intended to “electrify the Republican grassroots movement,”24 then-candidate Donald \n                                                 \n24 Sunshine Summit, “Thank You,” http://www.sunshinesummit.gop/thank-you (stating mission).  \n  17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 149   Filed 12/21/17   Page 25 of 30 PageID #: 6524\n \nTrump stated: “We are going to hire Americans first. We’re going to take care of our workers. \nDid you ever hear of the Dream Act? It is not for our children. The Dream Act is for other \nchildren that come into the country. I want the Dream Act to be for our children.”25 Two days \nearlier at the fourth Republican presidential primary debate, Trump had promised a “deportation \nforce” based on President Eisenhower’s enforcement of the border that included deportation \nefforts such as the 1954 Operation Wetback. In particular, he lauded Eisenhower’s program of \ndeporting people deep into Mexico, saying, “Moved them way south. They never came back.”26 \nRescinding DACA exposes DACA recipients to this “deportation force.” \nThese relatively early primary campaign statements are repeated during the general election \ncampaign after Trump garners the Republican Party nomination. In a speech on August 24, 2016, \nTrump juxtaposes truly deserving American children against DACA recipients: “Where is the \nsanctuary city for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk \nabout are the young Americans. Why aren’t young Americans dreamers also? I want my \ndreamers to be young Americans.”27 In another general campaign speech, he implores, “Let our \nchildren be dreamers too.”28 \nOn September 1, 2017, when asked by reporters whether Dreamers should be worried, he \nresponded, “We love the DREAMers . . . We think the DREAMers are terrific.”29 Mere days \nlater, on September 5, the Trump administration ended DACA. In doing so, President Trump \n                                                 \n25 Donald J.

Our \nfirst and highest priority must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American workers and \ntheir families.”30 \nIn this usage, Trump has co-opted “dreamer” and uses it instead to paint DACA recipients as \ninterlopers whose unlawful presence threatens the rightful economic opportunities of \n“American” children. “Dreamer” itself becomes a code word that is intended to inflame and \nexploit negative sentiment based on people’s economic anxieties. \nThe code word analysis provided in the Pitti Report, as well as the discourse analysis in The \nPresident’s Intent, shows that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of proving animus and \nprevailing on their equal protection and APA claims. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant the relief sought by Plaintiffs.  \n \nDated:  December 21, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n  FRED T.

The Attorney General’s stated policy reasons for ending DACA have no basis \nin fact and are easily disproven by numerous research studies. ................................. 12 \nC.

NLC is a resource and advocate for 19,000 cities, towns and villages, representing \nmore than 218 million Americans. The United States Conference of Mayors is the official non-\npartisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more. There are 1,408 such cities in \nthe country today. Each city is represented in the Conference by its chief elected official, the mayor.   \nThis litigation is of significant interest to Amici, since 251,000, or more than 1 in 3, of all \ncurrently active recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program live in \n                                                 \n1 Counsel for Amici authored this brief in whole, and no party, no party’s counsel, nor any other \nperson has contributed money intended to fund preparation of this brief.

According to the United States Citizen and Immigration Service \n(USCIS), as of September 4, 2017, approximately 13% of all active DACA recipients reside in the \nLos Angeles metro area.  Another 6.8% and 5% of all active recipients reside in the New York and \nChicago metro regions, respectively.  Austin, Denver, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, and \nSeattle together account for another 9% of the active DACA population.  Collectively, more active \nDACA recipients reside in Amici’s metro areas than the combined active DACA populations of 43 \nstates.3 \nSince obtaining deferred action, these DACA recipients – our residents – have made \nsubstantial contributions to our respective communities as business owners, educators, researchers, \nartists, journalists and civic leaders.  Tens of thousands more DACA enrollees are attending our \nlocal schools, studying to become our newest doctors and nurses, lawyers, and entrepreneurs.  \nMany DACA recipients work directly for Amici, and play critical roles in our daily government \noperations.  No matter how DACA recipients choose to contribute, all of Amici are stronger and \nsafer because of the DACA program.  Therefore, Amici profoundly object to Defendants’ actions \n                                                 \n2 United States Citizen and Immigration Service data show that approximately 800,000 applicants \nhave qualified for DACA since the start of the program.  Approximately 690,000 DACA recipients \ncurrently have active DACA status.  For purposes of this brief, residency in a “metropolitan area” is \ndefined as residency in a Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) at the time of the DACA recipient’s \nmost recent application.  CBSAs are defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget.  \nSee U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services DACA Data dated “As of September 4, 2017” (USCIS \nDATA).

Both of these actions are harmful and unlawful.   \nSince its inception more than two centuries ago, our nation has served as an adopted home \nfor generations of migrant children.  Welcoming and protecting young immigrants is part and \nparcel of our DNA.  Over a century ago, in 1904, the Washington Post profiled eleven “matrons” \nwhose job was to care for minor children arriving in the United States through New York Harbor \nand Ellis Island.  The head matron, Regina Stucklen, noted that the children under her care were \n“the sweetest things that grow.”4 \nMore than one million children passed through Ellis Island in its 62 years as an immigration \nstation.  Some of those “sweetest things” grew to become laborers in our factories, warehouses \nand mills, driving our engines of economic growth.  Others chose lives in public service, becoming \nmembers of our military, teachers, social workers, firefighters, and police officers.  Many more \nwere homeowners, parents, and taxpayers.  Included among those children who entered the United \nStates via Ellis Island were renowned artists, athletes, musicians, and authors, like Irving Berlin, \nBob Hope, Claudette Colbert, Knute Rockne, and Frank Capra and institutional leaders, like Los \nAngeles Archbishop Timothy Manning, San Francisco Mayor George Christopher, and Supreme \nCourt Justice Felix Frankfurter.5 \nHowever these immigrants came to our country, those who arrived here as children helped \nto build the foundation of Amici’s economic prosperity, military security, cultural artistry and civic \nsociety.  Amici are looking to a new generation of child migrants, especially those eligible for the \nDACA program, to help guide our financial and cultural success into the future.   \n                                                 \n4 Special Correspondence, Tots at Ellis Island, THE WASHINGTON POST (June 5, 1904), \navailable at: https://secure.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/144543811.html. \n5 Moreno, Barry, Children of Ellis Island, ARCADIA PUBLISHING (2005). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 11 of 36 PageID #: 6948\nStated in more detail, the DACA program is important to Amici for several reasons. \nFirst, the DACA program promotes economic prosperity and benefits taxpayers, which \nmeans that Amici will suffer direct economic harm if DACA is rescinded.  Amici rely heavily upon \nthe economic contributions of foreign-born residents and DACA recipients make up a statistically \nsignificant portion of Amici’s foreign-born labor force.  Collectively, the DACA recipients living \nin Amici cities and counties openly earn billions of dollars in taxable income because of the work \nauthorization benefit provided by the DACA program.6  \nA 2017 study by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found DACA recipients \npay an estimated $1.6 billion in state and local taxes annually, giving them a higher effective tax \nrate than the average state and local tax rate paid by the top 1% of U.S. taxpayers.7  Because USCIS \ndata show that DACA recipients are concentrated in Amici’s metro areas, those with deferred \naction are an important subset of the foreign-born populations critical to the economy of Amici \ncities.  This arbitrary and capricious action by Defendants to eliminate DACA will negatively \nimpact Amici by removing hundreds of thousands of workers, business owners and taxpayers from \nour respective economies. \nOn a micro-economic level, the benefits gained through the DACA program have given \nrecipients of deferred action the encouragement and comfort they needed to openly enter the work \nforce, take on student loans, sign mortgages, and start businesses.  Studies show that DACA \nrecipients have in fact made profound economic gains because of receiving deferred action.  In a \nrepresentative survey, the Center for American Progress found that 69% of employed recipients \n                                                 \n6 USCIS DACA Frequently Asked Questions (USCIS DACA FAQ), at Question 1, available at: \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions (stating that “an individual whose case has \nbeen deferred is eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, \nprovided he or she can demonstrate ‘an economic necessity for employment.’”) \n7 Available on the ITEP website at: http://tinyurl.com/ITEPDACAstudy \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 12 of 36 PageID #: 6949\nmoved to a higher-paying job after receiving deferred action and 5% of recipients started a new \nbusiness after receiving deferred action, which is a rate of business creation greater than among \nthe general public.8  The Center’s study also found that the hourly wages of surveyed DACA \nrecipients increased by an average of 42%; that 60% of those with increased earnings have become \nfinancially independent; and that 61% have started to contribute to their family’s finances.  At least \nhalf of all DACA recipients surveyed by the Center reported that they have bought a car since \nreceiving deferred action, 12% have bought their first home and 25% have a child who is an \nAmerican citizen. \nTerminating this program will not only roll back these financial and familial gains earned \nby DACA recipients, it will harm Amici, in that cities and counties operate – and our taxpayers \nfund – the social safety net that will be required to catch these families if the DACA recipients’ \nwork authorization is taken away and families are forced apart by ICE removals. \nSecond, DACA promotes public safety and public welfare.  A study by The Sentencing \nProject demonstrates that communities with larger immigrant populations, including Amici, have \noutpaced the public safety gains of their peers.  In 1990, the reported violent crime rate was 730 \noffenses per 100,000 residents.  That same year the number of foreign-born individuals living in \nthe United States was roughly 19.8 million.  The violent crime rate began to fall in the mid-1990s \nand by 2014 it was half of its 1990 level, at 362 offenses per 100,000 residents.  By that year, the \nforeign-born population had more than doubled, reaching 42.2 million people.9 \n \n                                                 \n8 Center for American Progress,  DACA Recipients’ Economic and Educational Gains Continue to \nGrow (2017) (CAP Study) Washington, D.C.

A study from the \nCATO Institute concluded that native-born Americans are 14% more likely than DACA-eligible \nimmigrants with the same age and education to be incarcerated.13  To even qualify for deferred \naction, applicants must submit detailed personal histories and pass a rigorous background check.  \nAnd, if they are arrested after obtaining deferred action, they can lose their DACA status.  Indeed, \nvery few DACA recipients – only 0.25% – have been expelled from the program for criminal \nactivity or other public safety concerns, which is a rate substantially lower than the general rate of \ncriminality in American society.14 \n                                                 \n10 Id. \n11 Burnett, John, New Immigration Crackdowns Creating ‘Chilling Effect’ on Crime Reporting, \nNational Public Radio (May 25, 2017), available at https://goo.gl/62P1mN.   \n12 Baker, Scott R., Effects of Immigrant Legalization on Crime: The 1986 Immigration Reform and \nControl Act, Stanford Law and Econ.

Houston-area paramedic Jesus Contreras is a DACA recipient.  He worked six \nstraight days after Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas, rescuing people from floodwaters and \nputting his own life in danger.  News reports show that had DACA been rescinded during those \nsix days, Contreras could have immediately been pulled from his ambulance, reducing the number \nof available first responders.15   Similarly, many have praised the efforts of the countless volunteers \nwho used their own boats, at their own peril, to rescue their neighbors during Hurricane Harvey.  \nOne such Good Samaritan, Alonso Guillen, was a 31-year-old DACA recipient who, according to \nreports, drowned while trying to save others from the deadly floodwaters that inundated the \nHouston area.16 \nIn addition, applicants who pass DACA’s strict vetting process were allowed to sign up for \nU.S. military service as part of a Pentagon program called Military Accessions Vital to the National \nInterest,  or  MAVNI.    The  day  after  Defendants  moved  to  terminate  DACA,  the  Pentagon \nannounced that 900 DACA recipients are actively serving or have signed recruitment contracts to \nserve in the military.  This service to our country and our communities, along with others whose \nservice stories have yet to be told, makes Amici safer. \nThus, and thirdly, DACA recipients bring many tangible and intangible benefits to Amici \ncities; benefits that improve upon, to quote Attorney General Sessions, “the well-being of our \nRepublic.”  Much like those children who passed through Ellis Island decades ago went on to \nbecome acclaimed actors, athletes, artists and leaders, today’s DACA recipients are helping to \n                                                 \n15 Flores, Adolfo, This Paramedic Who Rescued Harvey Victims May Be Deported If Trump Ends \nDACA, BUZZFEED (September 1, 2017) available at: http://tinyurl.com/paramedicstory \n16 Carroll, Susan and Kriel, Lomi Lost in Cypress Creek HOUSTON CHRONICLE (September 9, \n2017), available at: http://tinyurl.com/lost-in-cypress-creek \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 36 PageID #: 6952\nweave our modern-day social fabric.  Active DACA recipients are employed by at least 72% of \nthe top 25 Fortune 500 companies, many of which are headquartered in Amici.  There are 250 \nDACA beneficiaries alone working at Apple Inc., the world’s most valuable company.17  \nAmong the individual recipients of deferred action are a public school teacher in Austin, \nTexas with a master’s degree in education focusing on hearing-impaired students; a Los Angeles-\nbased graphic designer who has worked on marketing campaigns for Star Wars: Rogue One and \nGame of Thrones; a political organizer based in Washington D.C., who recently served as a press \nsecretary for a 2016 presidential candidate; a producer for MSNBC’s Morning Joe who helps \nshape the network’s morning programming and, separately, a licensed attorney and the first \nmember of the New York State Bar with DACA status, both of whom live in New York City.  \nTurning our back on DACA recipients is turning our back on the future. \nARGUMENT \nThis litigation is about protecting young people who were brought here by their parents, \noften as infants.

To the extent Defendants did cite reasons for ending DACA, those are disproven by \ncompelling evidence. \nMoreover, in creating the DACA program, DHS announced that it would defer action \nagainst those eligible because it could find no reason to expel innocent young people, at the \nexpense of other departmental enforcement priorities.  President Obama emphasized DACA would \n“lift the shadow of deportation.”19  In other words, DHS made a promise – i.e. sign up for DACA \nand turn over sensitive information to authorities in return for protection from deportation – upon \nwhich each and every DACA recipient relied.   The principles of Due Process and require \nDefendants to honor that promise and favor the Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief. \nI.  This Court should grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants’ from \nrescinding the DACA program because DHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously and \nfailed to follow the notice and comment procedures in violation of the APA. \n \nA.  The Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of their substantive APA claim because \nDHS’s sole stated reason for ending the DACA program was conclusory and \nrelies upon flawed legal analysis. \n \nDHS is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the September 5, 2017 \nmemorandum from Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke rescinding DACA is an “agency action” \nsubject to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. §§ 551(13), 704.  Accordingly, DHS must employ “reasoned \ndecisionmaking” when taking a final agency action.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 52 (1983).  An agency action is final when “rights or obligations \nhave been determined or legal consequences will flow from the agency action.”  Port of Boston \nMarine Terminal Ass’n. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970).  Any action \ntaken “without observance of procedure required by law” or that is “arbitrary” or “capricious” is \n                                                 \n19 Id. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 36 PageID #: 6954\n“unlawful” and must be “set aside” by the court.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D).   \nIn the DHS memo rescinding DACA, Defendants state in a conclusory manner that it was \n“clear” DACA “should be terminated.”20  The memo presumes that because a Texas district court \npreliminarily enjoined a separate DHS program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) in 2015, DACA must suffer from “the same legal and \nconstitutional defects.”21  In justifying this legal conclusion, the Rescission Memo leans entirely \non a 362-word letter from Attorney General Sessions. \nIn this short letter, the Attorney General asserts – by fiat – that: (1) DACA is just like \nDAPA; (2) DAPA was preliminarily enjoined on “multiple legal grounds,” and that injunction was \naffirmed by the Fifth Circuit; therefore, (3) DACA is “likely” to be similarly enjoined, so DHS \nshould rescind the program immediately.22   \nDHS’s sudden retreat from DACA was arbitrary and capricious and violates the APA.As a \nthreshold issue, Defendants’ embrace of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion declaring DAPA subject to \njudicial review is wholly inconsistent with the position they have presented to this Court in their \nMotion to Dismiss – i.e. a court may, under no circumstances, review the agency’s exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion.23  If Defendants believe that no court may review DHS’s purported \nexercise of prosecutorial discretion, or that no one has standing to challenge such a decision, they \nshould not have advanced the Fifth Circuit’s opinion as the basis for terminating DACA.   \n                                                 \n20 DHS Memorandum titled Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals \n(Rescission Memo)(September 5, 2017), available at: http://tinyurl.com/2017Memo. \n21 Id., quoting Letter from Attorney General Sessions to DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke on \nthe  Rescission  of  DACA  (September  4,  2017)  (Sessions  Letter),  available  at: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/AG-Duke-Letter; see also Texas v.

Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 186, 214-215 (5th Cir. 2015).24  The dissent's \nreasoning should instead guide this Court’s analysis.  Id. at 214-218 (King, J., dissenting). \nDespite DHS’s current position, all three branches of the Federal government have long \nembraced deferred action as a part of the immigration landscape.  In fact, “deferred action” is one \nof the well-established ways in which DHS prioritizes enforcement.25  The Supreme Court has \nrecognized that deferred action is “a regular practice” in which DHS exercises “discretion for \nhumanitarian  reasons  or  simply  for  its  own  convenience.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483-84 (1999); see also Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. \n387, 396 (2012) (stating “a principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised \nby immigration officials.  Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense \nto pursue removal at all.”).   \nCongress, meanwhile, has enacted legislation explicitly recognizing the DHS practice of \ngranting deferred action.  For example, the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, allows \nstates to issue driver’s licenses to those undocumented immigrants with “approved deferred action \nstatus.”  Similarly, since 1981, federal regulations – created by notice and comment rulemaking - \nallow those “granted deferred action” to “apply for employment authorization.”  8 C.F.R. § \n274a.12(a)(11).  And Congress has yet to disturb this regulation in three-plus decades. \nMore  practically,  Congress  has  never  appropriated  funding  sufficient  to  remove  all \nundocumented immigrants.  This is why DHS, and its predecessors, have implemented more than \n                                                 \n24 See also Simons v. Bellinger, 643 F.2d 774, 809, n.48 (1980) (Wilkey, J., dissenting) (a \n“determination was an alternative basis for dismissal, and to that extent the language may be \nregarded as dictum”). \n25 See also Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support, 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO, Document 96-1, at 8. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 36 PageID #: 6956\n20 deferred action policies over the last 50 years.26  Programs like DAPA and DACA enable DHS \nto focus limited resources on removing serious criminals by deferring action on low priority \nimmigrants.  As the D.C. Circuit Court wrote in Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Pierce, \n786 F.2d 1199, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1986), “[t]he power to decide when to investigate, and when to \nprosecute, lies at the core of the Executive’s duty to see to the faithful execution of the laws.”  \nMoreover, “Congress has never prohibited or limited ad hoc deferred action, which is no different \nthan DAPA other than scale.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 216 (King, J., dissenting). \nFinally, even if DAPA were, as the Fifth Circuit concluded, “contrary” to the INA, Texas, \n809 F.3d at 179, that rationale is inapplicable to DACA.   Despite the Attorney General’s assertion, \nDACA is not just like DAPA.  The Fifth Circuit’s opinion itself specifically notes “DACA and \nDAPA are not identical.”  Id. at 174 (finding “eligibility for DACA was restricted to a younger and \nless numerous population,” and DAPA had different “discretionary criteria”).   \nIn sum, the only reason DHS gave for rescinding DACA was that the program was “likely” \nto be unlawful.  But DACA is lawful,27 which means that Defendants’ actions are in violation of \nthe APA given there is no other proffered agency justification for the rescission by DHS.  See \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Rauch, 244 F. Supp.  3d 66, 96 (D.D.C. 2017) (stating \n“suffice it to say, it is arbitrary and capricious for an agency to base its decision on a factual premise \nthat the record plainly showed to be wrong.”).   \nB.  The Attorney General’s stated policy reasons for ending DACA have no basis \nin fact and are easily disproven by numerous research studies. \nOutside of the Rescission Memo, the only other basis Defendants offer to justify the DACA \ntermination are remarks Attorney General Sessions in a speech delivered the same day DHS took \n                                                 \n26 United States v. Texas, 2015 U.S. Briefs 674 (Initial Brief of Appellant-Petitioner at 5) (Mar. 1, 2016). \n27 See also Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support, 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO, Document 96-1, at 5. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 36 PageID #: 6957\naction.28  In that speech, the Attorney General asserted that eliminating DACA was necessary to \n“protect the overall health and well-being of our Republic” and to “save lives, protect communities \nand taxpayers, and prevent human suffering.” \nNot only do the Attorney General’s misstatements undermine the core values of Amici \ncities and counties, the true facts contradict his own stated purposes for this action.  For example, \nforeign-born residents make up almost half of Los Angeles’ workforce; they contribute over $3 \nbillion in state and local taxes yearly; they own businesses that generate $3.5 billion in annual \nincome for city residents; and, they have local spending power of almost $30 billion a year.29  \nEnding DACA will negatively impact all American citizens living in Los Angeles by removing \ntens  of  thousands  of  foreign-born  workers,  business  owners  and  taxpayers  from  the  city’s \neconomy.   \nThe same economic harm would befall other Amici.  More than 51% of all of New York \nCity’s business owners are foreign-born and foreign-born residents are responsible for 32% ($100 \nbillion) of all income earned by New York City residents.  New York City families that include \nimmigrant members pay an estimated $8 billion in city and state personal income taxes and \napproximately $2 billion in city property taxes.30  Similarly, 35% of business owners in San \n                                                 \n28 It is unclear whether the Attorney General was speaking for DHS and Amici do not concede he was \nor that Defendants may rely on his remarks to defend their actions.  In stating “[w]e at Department of \nJustice are proud and honored to work to advance this vision for America,” it appears his comments \nwere on behalf of the Department of Justice only.

DACA recipients are a vital and thriving subset of the large foreign-\nborn populations, critical to the economy of Amici cities and counties.  The DACA program has \nprovided deferred action to some 800,000 applicants, 91% of whom are employed, which equates \nto 1 in 33 (3%) of all foreign-born persons in the United States labor force.33 \nStudies show that DACA recipients across the board obtain higher earnings and have a \nhigher employment rate, and higher tax compliance rate than similarly-situated undocumented \nimmigrants.34  Therefore, it is clear that the best way to “protect taxpayers” – a stated purpose of \nthe Attorney General – is to maintain DACA.  Eliminating the program will result in decreased tax \ncontributions, reduced employment rates and lower effective tax rates for our resident populations.  \nThere is a sociological term for this type of economic retrenchment by high achieving young \nimmigrant populations; the “transition to illegality.”   \nAccording to Harvard Assistant Professor Roberto Gonzales, author of the book “Lives in \nLimbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America,” terminating the DACA program and \n                                                 \n31  United  States  Census  Bureau.

Gonzales’ own studies show that most will regress \n(i.e. move backward) in their schooling and careers, in part because they will have been disavowed \nby the only government they have ever known.  Put in economic terms, ending DACA will sow an \neconomic slowdown, as estimates show DACA recipients would otherwise contribute $460 billion \nto the United States gross domestic product over the next ten years (a contribution of $114 billion \nto State Respondents’ cumulative GDP alone).35  In fiscal terms, this equates to $60 billion in lost \nfederal, state and local tax revenues over the next decade.36  These figures directly contradict the \nAttorney General’s claims and herald a negative impact on Amici. \nMoreover, despite the Attorney General’s assertion that terminating DACA will “save \nlives,” ending the program will make communities less safe by pushing recipients underground.  \nFurther,  numerous  academic  studies  examining  the  impact  of  immigrants  on  their  adopted \ncommunities reveal that communities with large immigrant populations, like Amici, have, at a bare \nminimum, shared in and, often, outpaced the nationwide crime drop over the past 30 years.37 \nAlso, because DACA applicants had to provide personal and biometric data to DHS to \nqualify for DACA, recipients will fear deportation at any moment, making them statistically less \nlikely  to  identify  themselves  to  law  enforcement,  including  Amici’s  sheriffs  and  police \ndepartments, to report crimes or assist in criminal investigations.38  The same fear can result in \n                                                 \n35 Center for American Progress, A New Threat to DACA Could Cost States Billions of Dollars \n(2017) Washington, D.C., available at: http://tinyurl.com/CAPStatesGDP. \n36 CATO Institute, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA (2017) Washington, D.C, \navailable at: http://tinyurl.com/CATODACAstudy \n37 Immigration and Public Safety (2017), The Sentencing Project, Washington, D.C., available at \nhttp://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Immigration-and-Public-Safety.pdf \n38 See, e.g., Theodore, Nik, University of Chicago, Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of \nPolice  Involvement  in  Immigration  Enforcement  (May  2013),  available  at: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/ChicagoPoliceStudy \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 23 of 36 PageID #: 6960\nunreported code enforcement and wage theft violations, crimes which are enforced by Amici.  Slum \nlandlords and sweatshop owners are likely to prey upon former DACA recipients if the program is \nterminated, resulting in unsafe and unhealthy conditions in the workplace and at home.  And there \nis the added risk of human trafficking as well.   \nAmici’s law enforcement leadership consistently reminds us that all communities are safer \nwhen victims and witnesses of crime, irrespective of immigration status, cooperate with law \nenforcement.  For example, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck has \nroutinely stated that his department depends on “immigrant communities, not only to keep them \nsafe but to keep [the public] safe.  Without that cooperation we all suffer.”39   \nIn fact, DACA recipients have consistently demonstrated important contributions to public \nsafety.  In May 2014, a DACA recipient residing in Los Angeles confronted an armed intruder in \nher apartment complex, who struck her in the head with a steel baton.40  Afterwards, the DACA \nrecipient helped LAPD identify and arrest the intruder.  LAPD then learned that associates of the \nintruder were looking for the victim, which resulted in her being placed in witness protection.  Id.  \nWithout the protection of DACA, the intruder’s associates could have silenced the victim by \nsimply reporting her to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for removal. \nLikewise, the removal of DACA’s protections endangers already vulnerable immigrant \ncommunities in the wake of natural disasters.

That will cause crimes to \ngo unreported and limit the success of police investigations, thereby greatly undermining public \nsafety for all of our residents in each our communities.

DHS failed to follow the APA’s notice and comment requirements prior to \nmoving to rescind DACA, which is why the Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits \nof their procedural APA claim. \nThe APA requires that federal agencies conduct a rulemaking process before engaging in \naction that impacts substantive rights.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D).  The Rescission Memo \nand the resulting actions taken to implement the Rescission Memorandum are “rules” under the \nAPA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), (4).  And defendants are not absolved of their responsibility to use \nthe  rulemaking  process  simply  because  DACA  was  enacted  without  notice  and  comment \nrulemaking in 2012.

The Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of their APA claim against DHS’s \nchange to its confidential information policy because Defendants’ failed to \nprovide any explanation whatsoever for the policy change, let alone a basis that \nwas not “arbitrary and capricious.” \n \nAny final agency action taken that is “arbitrary” or “capricious” is “unlawful” and must be \n“set aside” by the court.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The United States Supreme Court, in interpreting \nthis section of the APA, holds that an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency \nentirely fails to consider an important aspect of the problem, or offers an explanation for its \ndecision that runs counter to evidence before agency, or offers an explanation that is so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., 463 US at 43. \nIn creating the DACA program, Defendants made promises that information provided by \nDACA  applicants  about  themselves  or  their  family  members  would  not,  absent  special \ncircumstances, be used for immigration enforcement purposes.  This promise was written into \nUSCIS’s official instructions regarding the application process.  Those instructions provide: \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 26 of 36 PageID #: 6963\nInformation provided in this request is protected from disclosure to ICE and U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To \nAppear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear \nguidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be shared with national \nsecurity and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other \nthan removal, including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for \nchildhood arrivals request itself, to identify or  prevent fraudulent claims, for \nnational security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal \noffense.    The  above  information  sharing  clause  covers  family  members  and \nguardians, in addition to the requestor.42 \n \nThis confidentiality promise was not something Defendants created from whole cloth just \nfor the DACA program.  In promoting DACA, numerous government officials highlighted DHS’s \npractice of protecting confidential information obtained through other deferred action programs \nover the years.  As then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson explained in a letter to \nCongresswoman Judy Chu, protecting information “submitted by people seeking deferred action” \nwas the “long-standing and consistent practice of DHS (and its predecessor INS)” for many \n“decades.”43 \nYet, in terminating the DACA program, the Rescission Memo provides no rationale for the \nchange to the confidential  information policy in DACA.   In fact, the Rescission Memo is \ncompletely silent on whether information provided in connection with DACA applications will \nnow be used for immigration enforcement purposes.   \nThe only reference to the change in information sharing practices appears in DHS guidance \nposted on its website on the same day that the Rescission Memo was issued.  The prior language \npromising that information provided by a DACA applicant will be “protected from disclosure to \n                                                 \n42  USCIS  Instructions  for  Consideration  of  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  (USCIS \nInstructions), at pg. 13 (emphasis added), available at: http://tinyurl.com/USCISInstructions \n43 Letter by Secretary Jeh Johnson dated December 30, 2016, to U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, available at: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/JehJohnsonLetter \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 27 of 36 PageID #: 6964\nICE and [CBP]” 44 is gone.  Instead, Defendants now assert that “[g]enerally, information will not \nbe  proactively  provided  to  ICE  and  CBP  for  the  purpose  of  immigration  enforcement \nproceedings.”45 The use of the qualifiers “generally” and “not be proactively provided” are \nsubstantial shifts in policy.  And the very next sentence in the guidance indicates that further \nwatering down of the confidential information policy should be expected in the near future or, \nfrankly, may have already occurred without notice.  It reads: “This [confidential information] \npolicy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended \nto, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \nenforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.”46 \nWhen an agency gives no explanation for its action, as is the case here with DHS’s change \nto the confidential information policy, a reviewing court’s decision is made easy and it must be \nmade in the Plaintiffs’ favor.  Put simply, failure to give a reason for a change of course renders \nadministrative behavior arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the APA.  See Illinois v.  \nInterstate Commerce Com., 722 F.2d 1341, 1348 (7th Cir. 1983) (citing Atchison, Topeka & Santa \nFe Ry. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, 412 U.S. 800, 807-08 (1973)) (finding that an agency “may not \nmake major policy changes by pure fiat, with no explanation” of why the change is being made.); \nCommuns. & Control, Inc. v. FCC, 374 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (finding that because \nthe FCC offered “no explanation” for deciding that a broadcaster’s typographical error rendered \nits license being void ab initio, the action was “arbitrary and capricious,” especially in light of the \nFCC’s past practice of correcting, “without much ado, typographical errors such as the one at  \n                                                 \n44 USCIS Instructions, supra note 42. \n45 DHS Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \n(DHS Rescission FAQs), at Question 8, available at: http://tinyurl.com/DHS-DACA-FAQ \n46 Id. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 28 of 36 PageID #: 6965\n \nissue.”); Sorenson Communs. v. FCC, 567 F.3d 1215, 1222 (10th Cir.  2009) (finding that, because \nthe FCC “failed to provide any reason why” federal funds given to a provider of telephone \ntransmission services enabling disabled individuals to communicate could not be used for lobbying \nexpenses, the FCC’s prohibition on the use of the funds was arbitrary and capricious in violation \nof 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).) \nTo be sure, the original DACA memorandum included a statement that applicants had no \nright to rely on statements made therein, but such boilerplate disclaimers do not always carry the \nday when they clash with guidance’s broader substance and purpose.  See, e.g., Appalachian Power \nCo. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1022-23 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Here, the recipients were highly vulnerable \nparties whose substantial reliance on the Memorandum’s assurances was all but certain – and \nindeed intended – as a practical matter.  The federal government persuaded them to “come out of \nthe shadows” and hand over sensitive information – including biometic data – to ICE in exchange \nfor DACA status.   \nDACA  applicants  responded  by  irrevocably  rearranging  their  lives,  funding  college \neducations, enrolling in the military, having American citizen children, buying homes and cars.  \nThese acts were not the just the foreseeable effects of the federal government program inducement \nbut rather what the program was at its core designed to induce.  Under these exceptional \ncircumstances, the government must have some reasonable purpose for changing a policy to allow \nthe government to use recipients’ confidential information.  Thus, an injunction is necessary to \nensure  “some  minimum  standard  of  decency,  honor  and  reliability  in  …  dealing  with  the \nGovernment.”  Heckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 59-61 (1984). \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 29 of 36 PageID #: 6966\nB.  DHS’s change in its policy regarding the permissible uses of sensitive DACA \ninformation  infringes  upon  Plaintiffs’  due  process  rights  and,  therefore, \nviolates the APA prohibition of federal agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  \nThe APA prohibits federal agency action that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  Here, the DHS Rescission FAQs issued alongside \nthe Rescission Memo drastically and substantially changes DHS’s confidential information policy \nwithout providing DACA applicants with any form of due process.   \nTo quote Justice Frankfurter, “due process of law” and “liberty” are among the “great \n[constitutional] concepts . . . purposely left to gather meaning from experience.  . . .  They relate \nto the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this Nation knew \ntoo well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged.”  National Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Co., 337 \nU.S. 582, 646 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).   \nDHS’s alteration of its DACA confidential information policy sends a message to our \nimmigrant residents that their government, including Amici, is not to be trusted – when in reality \nAmici are fighting to protect these basic rights, because any person present in the United States, \nincluding every DACA recipient living in our respective cities and counties, is guaranteed due \nprocess before he or she may be deprived of a liberty interest.  U.S. Const. amend. V; Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 693-94 (2001); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (noting that \nliberty includes the ability to form the “enduring attachments of normal life”).   \nThe operational success of the entire DACA program flows from a core promise, i.e., the \nprohibition on use of personal information for immigration enforcement.  But for this promise, the \nrisks to a DACA-eligible person of identifying oneself to the nation’s immigration enforcement \nagency would have far outweighed any short-term benefit earned, which is why the official USCIS \nform application instructions state that “information provided” is “protected from disclosure to \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 30 of 36 PageID #: 6967\nICE and U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a \nreferral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance.”47 \nDHS’s detailed DACA policies, together with the Napolitano Memo and remarks of the \nPresident of the United States – delivered with the purpose of “lifting the shadow of deportation” \n–  gave  DACA  recipients  a  liberty  interest  in  the  promise  of  the  DACA  program  (i.e., \nconfidentiality).  Consistently, Supreme Court cases have found liberty interests in the continued \nreceipt  of welfare payments or of a public school teaching position despite lack of tenure \nprotections or employment contract because of an “implied promised of continued employment.”  \nBd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (citing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262 \n(1970) and Connell v. Higginbotham, 403 U.S. 207, 208 (1971)). \n  In Bd. of Regents v. Roth, the Supreme Court wrote that to have a protected interest in a \nbenefit, a person clearly must have “more than an abstract need.”  The person “must, instead, have \na legitimate claim of entitlement to it.”  Id.  DACA recipients have earned their “claim of \nentitlement” to confidentiality.  Put plainly, DACA recipients’ self-identification to DHS was \nlikely an irreversible action taken at the encouragement of the federal government.  DACA \napplicants would not have taken the risk of sharing intimate details and biometric data about \nthemselves and their families – serving up removal of themselves and their families on a platter – \nwithout the promises made by Defendants.  Former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson \nconfirmed as much in a letter to Congresswoman Judy Chu when he wrote, “DACA applicants \n                                                 \n47 DHS Memorandum titled Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who \nCame  to  the  United  States  as  Children  (June  15,  2012)  (Napolitano  Memo),  available  at: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/2012Memo; see also USCIS Instructions, supra note 42. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 31 of 36 PageID #: 6968\nmost assuredly relied” upon the “representations made by the U.S. government.”48 \nDefendants may choose to highlight the fact that USCIS retained “discretion” in acting on \nthe DACA program.”49  But the fact that DHS retained “discretion” in reviewing applications and \ngranting DACA status cannot cure Defendants’ unconstitutional actions.  The Supreme Court has \nheld that having discretion over the issuance of benefits does not eliminate the need to provide \nDue Process.  See Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U.S. 117, 123 (1926).   \nIn Goldsmith, the petitioner was a lawyer who had been refused admission to practice \nbefore the United States Board of Tax Appeals.  The Board had published rules for admission of \npersons entitled to practice before it, which provided “that the Board may in its discretion deny \nadmission to any applicant, or suspend or disbar any person after admission.”  Id. at 119.  Under \nits discretionary power, the Board denied admission to the petitioner without a hearing or stating \na reason for the denial.  The Supreme Court stated that the posted rules gave the petitioner an \ninterest and claim to practice before the Board to which procedural due process requirements \napplied.  Specifically, the Board’s discretionary power “must be construed to mean the exercise of \na discretion to be exercised after fair investigation, with such a notice, hearing and opportunity to \nanswer for the applicant as would constitute due process.” Id., at 123. \nEven assuming arguendo that Defendants are correct in stating that the Napolitano Memo \ndid not grant any substantive rights (i.e., the memo simply set forth the criteria under which DHS \nhad the discretion to grant deferred action on a case-by-case basis) this does not justify Defendants’ \nattempt to casually rewrite DHS confidentiality rules protecting some 900,000 DACA applicants \nin blanket fashion..  If the Napolitano Memo did not grant substantive rights, the information-\n                                                 \n48 Letter by Secretary Jeh Johnson dated December 30, 2016, to U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, available at: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/JehJohnsonLetter \n49 USCIS DACA FAQ, at Question 51, supra note 6. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 172   Filed 12/22/17   Page 32 of 36 PageID #: 6969\nsharing policy created by action separate from the Napolitano Memo certainly did, and DHS’s \nacross-the-board change to that policy violates basic principles of fairness.  Therefore, Defendants’ \nactions in opening recipients’ personal information to use by ICE and CBP in removal proceedings, \nviolates the Due Process rights of Plaintiffs in this action.  Because the actions violate Due Process, \nthey are also unlawful under the APA and should be enjoined. \nCONCLUSION \nAmici respectfully urge the Court to issue a nationwide injunction preventing Defendants \nfrom terminating DACA or using information obtained from DACA  recipients for removal \nproceedings.  If the federal government is allowed to renege on a promise it made to 800,000 \nrecipients and their family members, a damaging message would be delivered that the United \nStates government cannot be trusted to act in a decent, honorable or reliable manner, and it would \nimpose significant adverse consequences on Amici. \nDated: December 22, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \nBy:       Michael J.

Plaintiffs allege, to relax the\nrestrictions on federal authorities' use of DACA applicants' personal information for\nimmigration-enforcement purposes. The court assumes familiarity with the factual and\nprocedural history of these cases and in particular with its November 9, 2017, Memorandum and\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 2 of 33 PageID #: 7369\nOrder (the \"November 9 M&O\")( Dkt. 104),^ which granted in part and denied in part\nDefendants' motion to dismiss these cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,^ and its\nFebruary 13, 2018, Amended Memorandum and Order (the \"February 13 M&O\")( Dkt. 254),\nwhich granted Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction barring Defendants from\nterminating the DACA program in its entirety. Before the court are Defendants' motions to\ndismiss the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' third amended complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to dismiss the State Plaintiffs' amended\ncomplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).

Defendants' motions are\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n' All record citations refer to the docket in Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen. No. 16-CV-4756 (E.D.N.Y.), except as\notherwise noted. For ease of reference, the court refers to the Department of Homeland Security as \"DHS,\" the\nDepartment of Justice as \"DOJ,\" and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as \"USCIS.\"\n^ In the November 9 M&O,t he court dismissed for lack of standing the fourth claim asserted in the Batalla Vidal\nPlaintiffs' second amended complaint, which alleged that Defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment by failing to provide individualized written notice to certain DACA recipients that they needed to\nrenew their DACA benefits by October 5,2017. (2d Am. Compl.( Dkt. 60)  160-65; Nov.9  M&O at 37-38.) The\ncourt also dismissed for lack of standing the State Plaintiffs' notice and information-use-policy claims. (Nov.9 \nM&O at 38-46.) While the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs reassert a notice claim in their third amended complaint( 3d Am.\nCompl.( \"BV TAC\")( Dkt. 113)  188-94), they concede that they do so only to preserve the claim for appeal and\nthat, under the reasoning of the November 9 M&O,t his claim should be dismissed (Pis. Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to\nDismiss the BV TAC( \"BV Pis. Opp'n\")( Dkt. 240) at 4 n.5). Accordingly, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' fourth claim\nfor relief is DISMISSED.\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 3 of 33 PageID #: 7370\nI.  LEGAL STANDARDS\nA.  Rule 12(b)(1)\nA Rule 12(b)(1) motion tests the court's subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a claim or\ncase.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Under Rule 12(b)(1), the court must dismiss a claim \"when\nthe ... court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\" Makarova v. United\nStates. 201 F.3d 110,113 (2d Cir. 2000). When considering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the court\n\"must take all uncontroverted facts in the complaint... as true, and draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the party asserting jurisdiction.\" Tandon v. Captain's Cove Marina of\nBridgeport. Inc.. 752 F.3d 239,243( 2d Cir. 2014). Nevertheless,\" the party asserting subject\nmatter jurisdiction 'has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it exists.'\"\nId.( quoting Makarova. 201 F.3d at 113).\nB.  Rule 12(b)(6)\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal adequacy of the plaintiffs complaint. To survive a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint must \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\n'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'\" Ashcroft v. Jqbal. 556 U.S. 662,6 78( 2009)\n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twomblv. 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). In considering the sufficiency\nof the complaint, the court \"accept[s] all [well-pleaded] factual allegations in the complaint as\ntrue, and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor,\" Chambers v. Time Warner.\nInc.. 28 2 F.3d 147,152( 2d Cir. 2002), but does need not to credit \"[tjhreadbare recitals of the\nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,\" Iqbal. 556 U.S. at 678.\nDetermining \"plausibility\" is a \"context-specific task,\" id. at 679, which \"depends on a host of\nconsiderations: the full factual picture presented by the complaint, the particular cause of action\nand its elements, and the existence of alternative explanations so obvious that they render\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 4 of 33 PageID #: 7371\nplaintiffs inferences unreasonable,\" L-7 Designs. Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC.6 47 F.3d 419, 430( 2d\nCir. 2011).\nThe court's review of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is generally limited to \"the facts alleged in\nthe complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by\nreference in the complaint,\" as well as documents \"integral\" to the complaint. DiFolco v.\nMSNBC Cable LLC.6 22 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010).\nII.  DISCUSSION\nThe court first analyzes Plaintiffs' claims challenging the decision to end the DACA\nprogram,t hen turns to the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' claims challenging Defendants'( 1) alleged\nchanges to the policy regarding the protection of DACA applicants' personal information (the\n\"information-use policy\")( BV TAC  177-82); and (2)r ejections of DACA renewal requests\nthat were delayed due to postal errors, received late in the day on October 5, 2017, or contained\n\"real or perceived clerical errors\"( id fl 199-205).\nA.  DACA Rescission\nPlaintiffs have stated a claim that the decision to end the DACA program was\nsubstantively arbitrary and capricious, in violation of Section 706(2)(A) of the Administrative\nProcedure Act( \"APA\"),5  U.S.C. § 706(2), and substantially motivated by discriminatory\nanimus, in violation of the equal-protection principle inherent in the Fifth Amendment's Due\nProcess Clause. Plaintiffs have not, however, stated a claim that the rescission of the DACA\nprogram was invalid because it was not implemented through notice-and-comment rulemaking,\nnor have they stated a claim that Defendants violated the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 601 et seq.( \"RFA\"), by failing to consider the rescission's impact on small entities.\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 5 of 33 PageID #: 7372\n1.  Substantive APA\nPlaintiffs challenge the decision to end the DACA program as substantively \"arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(A). (BV TAG IK 177-82; State Pis. Am. Compl. UK 253-56.) In its February 13 M&O,\nthe court found that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. For the reasons\nstated in that opinion, Defendants' motion to dismiss these claims is DENIED.^ Additionally,\nthe court notes that it would be inappropriate to dismiss Plaintiffs' substantive APA claims at\nthis stage oft he litigation, as \"there is a strong suggestion\" that the administrative record\npreviously produced by Defendants is incomplete, \"entitling [Plaintiffs] to discovery regarding\nthe completeness of the record.\" (Dec. 27,2017, USCA Order( Dkt. 210) at 2-3 (quoting Dopico\nV. Goldschmidt 687 F.2d 644, 654( 2d Cir. 1982)).)^\n^ Defendants have also contested whether Make the Road New York( \"MRNY\")a nd the State Plaintiffs fall within\nthe APA's \"zone of interests.\" (BV MTD at 12; State MTD at 20-21.) These Plaintiffs fall within the zone of\ninterests of the Immigration and Nationality Act such that they may bring suit under the APA. DACA recipients are\nmembers, clients, and employees of MRNY,a n organization that advocates for immigrants' rights. (BV TAG  46,\n49-50; BV Pis. Opp'n at 6-7.) At the very least, the State Plaintiffs employ a number of DACA recipients. (Nov.9 \nM&O at 38-40; State Pis. Opp'n at 3-6.) Plaintiffs' interests in the decision to end the DACA program are thus not\n'\"so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the [Immigration and Nationality Act] that it\ncannot reasonably be assumed that' Congress authorized [those] plaintiff[s] to sue.\" Lexmark Int'l. Inc. v. Static\nControl Components. Inc.. 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1389( 2014)( quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of\nPottawatomi Indians v. Patchak. 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012)1: see also Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass'n. 479 U.S. 388,399\n(1987). Defendants rely on Federation for American Immigration Reform. Inc. v. Reno. 93 F.3d 897( D.C. Cir.\n1996)( \"FAIR\"), but that case held only that members of an anti-immigration group lacked statutory standing, based\non their generalized objections to immigration, to challenge a decision to accord relief to Cuban immigrants. S^ jd\nat 900-04. Unlike in FAIR. Plaintiffs in the above-captioned cases are directly affected by Defendants' actions. See\nRegents of the Univ. of Calif, v. DHS.2 79 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1036 n.l2(N.D. Cal. 2018).\nRecord-related discovery remains stayed pending the Second Circuit's ruling on Defendants' interlocutory appeal\nfrom the November 9 M&O. (See Jan. 8, 2017, Mem.&  Order( Dkt. 233) at 9-10.) The court reiterates that\nDefendants vigorously sought that interlocutory appeal before reversing course and conceding that the Second\nCircuit should hold Defendants' petitions for leave to appeal in abeyance pending this court's ruling on Plaintiffs'\nmotions for a preliminary injunction and Defendants' motions to dismiss. (Reply in Supp. of Pet. for Permission to\nAppeal (Dkt. 28, Nielsen v. Vidal, No. 18-122( 2d Cir.)) at 2; see also Feb. 13 M&O at 21 & n.6.) The Second\nCircuit thereafter agreed to hold these petitions for leave to file in abeyance pending this court's ruling on the\npending motions. (USCA Jan. 31, 2018, Order( Dkt. 249).)\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 6 of 33 PageID #: 7373\n2.  Procedural APA\nPlaintiffs next claim that the decision to end the DACA program was procedurally\ndefective, in violation of Section 706(2)(D) of the APA, because the Department of Homeland\nSecurity( \"DHS\") did not use notice-and-comment rulemaking to rescind the program. These\nclaims raise challenging questions but are ultimately unavailing.\nUnder the APA, an agency generally must use notice-and-comment procedures to make\nany \"rule.\" 5 U.S.C. § 553.^ The APA exempts from this requirement, however,\" general\nstatements of policy,\" among other types of rule. Id. § 553(b)(A). The parties dispute whether\nthe memorandum announcing the rescission of the DACA program (the \"DACA Rescission\nMemo\")( Mem. from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y, DHS, Rescission of the June 15,2012\nMemorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who\nCame to the United States as Children\"( Dkt. 77-1 at ECF p.252)) is a \"general statement of\npolicy\" exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements or instead a \"legislative\nrule\" subject to these requirements. (Compare BV MTD at 18-20, and State MTD at 28-31, with\nBV Pis. Opp'n at 12-16, and State Pis. Opp'n at 15-19.) The DACA Rescission Memo was not\nformulated through notice-and-comment rulemaking, so if it is a legislative rule, it is invalid.\nSee 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 706(2)(D).\nAs the court has already noted, the line between legislative rules and non-legislative rules\n\"is enshrouded in considerable smog.\" (Feb. 13 M&O at 30( quoting Noel v. Chapman. 508\nF.2d 1023,1030( 2d Cir. 1975)).) See also NatT Mining Ass^n v. McCarthv. 758 F.3d 243, 251\n(D.C. Cir. 2014)( characterizing the inquiry for determining whether an agency action is a\n^ The APA defines \"rule\" as \"the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and\nfuture effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure,\nor practice requirements of an agency.\" 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 7 of 33 PageID #: 7374\nlegislative rule, an interpretive rule, or a general statement of policy as \"quite difficult and\nconfused\"). There are, however, general principles to guide the court's inquiry. If the rule alters\nthe rights or obligations of regulated parties \"or produces other significant effects on private\ninterests,\" it is legislative. White v. Shalala. 7 F.3d 296, 303 (2d Cir. 1993)( citation omitted);\nsee also Chrvsler Corp. v. Brown. 441 U.S. 281, 302( 1979)( legislative rules \"affect[] individual\nrights and obligations\"( citation omitted)); Lewis-Mota v. Sec'v of Labor. 469 F.2d 478,482( 2d\nCir. 1972). The D.C. Circuit has summarized what makes a \"legislative\" rule:\nAn agency action that purports to impose legally binding obligations\nor prohibitions on regulated parties—and that would be the basis for\nan enforcement action for violations of those obligations or\nrequirements—is a legislative rule. An agency action that sets forth\nlegally binding requirements for a private party to obtain a permit or\nlicense is a legislative rule.\nNat'l Mining Ass'n. 758 F,3d at 251-52.\nIf, however, the rule does not alter regulated parties' rights and obligations but instead\n\"educat[es].,. agency members in the agency's work,\" or is \"directed primarily at the staff of\nan agency describing how it will conduct agency discretionary functions,\" the rule is a general\npolicy statement. Noel. 508 F.2d at 1030 (first quoting Henry Friendly, The Federal\nAdministrative Agencies 145-46 (1962), and then quoting Arthur E. Bonfield, Some Tentative\nThoughts on Public Participation in the Making of Interpretative Rules and General Statements\nof Policv Under the APA.2 3 Admin. L. Rev. 101,115 (1971)); see also Lincoln v. Vigil. 508\nU.S. 182,197( 1993)( general statements of policy are \"issued by an agency to advise the public\nprospectively of the manner in which the agency proposed to exercise a discretionary power\"\n(quoting Chrvsler. 441 U.S. at 302 n.31)); Nat'l Mining Ass'n. 758 F.3d at 252( \"An agency\naction that merely explains how the agency will enforce a statute or regulation—^in other words.\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 8 of 33 PageID #: 7375\nhow it will exercise its broad enforcement discretion or permitting discretion under some extant\nstatute or rule—^is a general statement of policy.\")-\nThe Second Circuit's decision in Noel helps reveal the uncertain boundary between\nlegislative rules and general statements of policy. In NoeL two Haitian nationals unlawfully\npresent in the United States and subject to orders of deportation married U.S. lawful permanent\nresidents and sought \"extended voluntary departure,\" a form of discretionary relief from\ndeportation that would have enabled them to remain in this country for up to two years while\nwaiting for visas. 508 F.2d at 1024. Between 1968 and 1972, it was the practice of the New\nYork District Director for Immigration and Naturalization Services( \"INS\") routinely to grant\nextended voluntary departure to such Western Hemisphere aliens who were present in this\ncountry and married to permanent resident aliens. Id at 1025. In 1972, however,I NS issued a\ndirective stating that such aliens \"should not routinely be granted extended departure time, but\nrather should be offered that privilege only in those cases where compelling circumstances\nwarranted the relief.\" Id at 1025-26. The plaintiffs argued, among other things, that this\ndirective was a legislative rule that was invalid because it was not made through notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking. Id at 1029. The Second Circuit rejected this argument, concluding that\nthe directive was a \"general statement of policy\" exempt from notice-and-comment\nrequirements. Id First, the Second Circuit noted that the directive did not purport to amend an\nexisting regulation vesting the district director v^th sole discretion to extend deportable aliens'\ntime in the United States or otherwise to oust him of this discretion. Id at 1030. Instead, the\ndirective only offered \"a statement by the agency of its general policy as a guideline for the\nDistrict Directors\" in their exercise of this discretion. Id Second, the directive did not\n\"change[ ] the existing right of the [aliens] to have their applications for extensions oft ime to\n8\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 9 of 33 PageID #: 7376\ndepart authorized in the sole discretion oft he district director,\" because those aliens remained\neligible to seek deferred voluntary departure, albeit only on the more limited basis of hardship.\nLike the directive at issue in Nod,t he DACA Rescission Memo appears to be a general\nstatement of policy, not a legislative rule. The DACA Rescission Memo does not deprive\nindividuals of a substantive right to receive deferred action or work authorization, or to have\nthese benefits renewed for additional terms. As the memorandum that launched the DACA\nprogram (the \"2012 DACA Memo\")s tates clearly, no such rights exist. (Mem. from Janet\nNapolitano, Sec'y» DHS,\" Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who\nCame to the United States as Children\"( \"2012 DACA Memo\")( Dkt. 77-1 at ECF p.l).) Instead,\nthe decision to grant or deny an individual deferred action and work authorization continues to\nlie within immigration authorities' discretion. Like the 2012 DACA Memo,t he DACA\nRescission Memo offers guidance to DHS employees as to how the agency intends to exercise\nthis discretion prospectively: Whereas the 2012 DACA Memo advises DHS staff to consider\nexercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals meeting certain identified criteria\n(such as age of entry into the United States and absence of a meaningful criminal record), the\nDACA Rescission Memo directs those staff not to consider those criteria when exercising their\nprosecutorial discretion. The DACA Rescission Memo is thus \"directed primarily at the staff of\n[DHS] describing how it will conduct agency discretionary functions.\" Noel. 508 F.2d at 1030\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nIt is true that, if the DACA Rescission Memo were to take effect, hundreds oft housands\nof individuals would no longer have the opportunity to seek deferred action and work\nauthorization through the DACA program. As Defendants note, however, the DACA Rescission\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 10 of 33 PageID #: 7377\nMemo does not purport to strip immigration authorities of the ability to grant deferred action and\nwork authorization, but only provides that they should not do based on the criteria identified in\nthe 2012 DACA Memo, or on the submission of DA CA  application materials. (BV MTD at 7\n(\"[A]s was true before implementation of the DACA Policy in 2012, deferred action remains\navailable on an individualized basis.\").) At least in theory, individuals who would have been\neligible for deferred action and work authorization under the DACA program may still qualify\nfor those benefits based on their individual circumstances. As a practical matter, the DACA\nRescission Memo almost certainly means that fewer individuals will receive for deferred action\nand work authorization. But the directive at issue in Noel surely reduced the number of aliens\neligible for discretionary relief, too, and that did not render the directive a legislative rule. See\nNoel. 508 F.2d at 1025-26.\nPlaintiffs contend that the DACA Rescission Memo nevertheless is a legislative rule\nbecause it binds DHS's discretion and requires the agency to reject all DACA applications and\nrenewal requests not meeting certain criteria. (BV Pis. Opp'n at 12-14; State Pis. Opp'n at 15-\n19.) As Plaintiffs point out, a number of courts outside this circuit—^most notably the D.C.\nCircuit—^have determined whether a rule is legislative at least partly by looking to whether the\nrule constrains the agency's own discretion. See, e.g.. Clarian Health W.. LLC v. Hargan. 878\nF.3d 346,357( D.C. Cir. 2017). In this view, a rule \"'cabining ... an agency's prosecutorial\ndiscretion can in fact rise to the level of a substantive, legislative rule' when it 'is in purpose or\nlikely effect one that narrowlv limits administrative discretion.'\" Ass'n of Irritated Residents v.\nEPA.4 94 F.3d 1027, 1034( D.C. Cir. 2007)f auoting Cmtv. Nutrition Inst. v. Young. 818 F.2d\n943, 948( D.C. Cir. 1987)( per curiam)). Plaintiffs note that the DACA Rescission Memo\n10\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 11 of 33 PageID #: 7378\nmandates the rejection of certain DACA applications, and therefore contend that the memo\neliminates DHS's discretion to consider those applications and thus constitutes a legislative rule.\nWhile there is some force to Plaintiffs' arguments, they are unavailing. As an initial\nmatter, it is not clear to this court that an agency's compliance with its stated policy is reason to\ndeem that policy a legislative rule. Because one might expect functional organizations generally\nto abide by their own policies, treating general compliance with internal policies as evidence that\nthose policies were in fact legislative rules risks writing the \"general statements of policy\"\nexception to notice-and-comment rulemaking out of the APA.^ Moreover, it is important to\nremember that the DACA Rescission Memo purports to end a program that was itself created by\na policy statement. Plaintiffs' view that Defendants must use notice and comment to stop what\nstarted without notice and comment is not only counterintuitive, but also at odds with the general\nprinciple that the procedures needed to repeal or amend a rule as the same ones that were used to\nmake the rule in the first place.  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 135 S. Ct. 1199,1206\n(2015)( \"Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an\ninitial interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals\nthat interpretive rule.\") To whatever extent the DACA Rescission Memo is in fact \"binding\" on\nDHS,t he court cannot agree that this prospective limitation on the agency's exercise of its\ndiscretion renders the memo a legislative rule.\nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' notice-and-comment claims is\nGRANTED.\n^ For an insightful argument why the \"practically binding\" standard is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. 435 U.S. 519( 1978), see\nCass R. Sunstein,\" Practically Binding\": General Policy Statements and Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking. 68\nAdmin. L. Rey. 491 (2016).\n11\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 12 of 33 PageID #: 7379\n3.  RFA\nPlaintiffs also assert claims under the RPA. (BV TAC  183-87; State Pis. Am. Compl.\n266-73.) Among other things, that statute provides that when an agency engages in\nrulemaking, it must consider the impact of the rule on \"small entities.\" 5 U.S.C. §§ 603(a),\n604(a). The Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs claim that the DACA Rescission Memo violated the RFA\nbecause it failed to consider the impact of the rescission on Plaintiff Make the Road New York\n(\"MRNY\")a nd similar small entities( BV TAC  184-85), while the State Plaintiffs contend\nthat DHS failed to consider the impact on \"small businesses, small nonprofits, and small\ngovernmental jurisdictions.\" (State Pis. Am. Compl.  266-73).\nThese claims are also unavailing. The RFA only requires an agency to publish an initial\nor final regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency is required to use notice-and-comment\nrulemaking procedures. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603(a), 604(a); U.S. Telecom Ass'n v. FCC.4 00 F.3d 29,\n42( D.C. Cir. 2005). Because DHS was not required to use notice and comment to rescind the\nDACA program, it was not required to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis in connection\nwith that decision.\nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' RFA claims is GRANTED.\n4.  Equal Protection\nThe court next turns to Plaintiffs' claims that the decision to end the DACA program\nviolated the U.S. Constitution because it was substantially motivated by racial animus against\nLatinos and, in particular, Mexicans. (BV TAC  195-98; State Pis. Am. Compl.  233-39.)\nDefendants move to dismiss these claims on the grounds that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly\nallege that the DACA rescission was motivated by unlawful animus. (E.g.. State MTD at 31-34.)\nThe court concludes, however, that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to raise a plausible\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 13 of 33 PageID #: 7380\ninference that the DACA rescission was substantially motivated by unlawful discriminatory\npurpose.\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\ngenerally prohibits government officials from discriminating on the basis of race. U.S. Const,\namend. XIV,§  1. Although the Equal Protection Clause by its terms applies to states, the\nSupreme Court has long recognized that the Due Process Clause oft he Fifth Amendment\ngenerally prohibits racial discrimination by the federal government as well. Boiling v. Shame.\n347 U.S. 497, 498-500( 1954). In order to state an equal-protection claim based on racial\ndiscrimination. Plaintiffs must allege \"that a government actor intentionally discriminated\nagainst them on the basis of race.\" Havden v. Countv of Nassau. 180 F.Sd 42,48( 2d Cir. 1999).\nWhere, as here. Plaintiffs challenge facially neutral official action, they may support this claim\nby alleging either that the facially neutral action \"is applied in a discriminatory fashion,\" or that\n\"it was motivated by discriminatory animus and its application results in a discriminatory effect.\"\n14 (first citing Yick Wo v. Hopkins. 118 U.S. 356, 373-74( 1886), and then citing Vill. of\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hons. Dev. Corp.. 429 U.S. 252, 264-65 (1977)( ^\"Arlington\nHeights\")). Only the latter theory is at issue here, as Plaintiffs argue that the DACA Rescission\nMemo both disadvantages and was intended to disadvantage certain racial groups. (BY TAC f\n197; State Pis. Am.

The court discusses each element of an equal-protection\nclaim in turn.\na)  Effect\nPlaintiffs allege that the rescission of the DACA program would have a disparate impact\non Latinos and especially Mexicans. (BY TAC If 197.) The State Plaintiffs allege that 78\npercent of DACA recipients are Mexican nationals. (State Pis. Am. Compl. If 6.)

(USCIS, Number of Form 1-82I D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood\nArrivals (Dkt. 55-1 at ECF p.2).)^ These allegations are sufficient to raise a plausible inference\nthat the end of the DACA program would have a disproportionally adverse effect on Latinos and\nespecially Mexicans.\nRelying heavily on United States v. Armstrong. 517 U.S. 456 (1996), Defendants argue\nthat Plaintiffs bear a \"rigorous\" or especially \"heavy burden\" to survive a motion to dismiss, and\nthus that allegations of the outsized impact of the DACA rescission on Latino/a individuals and\nespecially Mexicans are insufficient to plead discriminatory effect. (BV MTD at 20-21; State\nMTD at 32( characterizing the prevalence of Mexican nationals among DACA recipients as \"an\nunsurprising accident of geography, not evidence of discrimination\").) Armstrong is, however,\ninapposite. In that case, the Court considered the initial showing that a criminal defendant\nasserting a \"selective prosecution\" claim under the Equal Protection Clause must make before\nobtaining discovery pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This is,\nhowever, a civil case, the pleading standards for which are set forth in Twomblv and Iqbal.\nMoreover, as the court has previously explained. Plaintiffs are not asserting a \"selective-\ndeportation\" claim, which might be analogized to the selective-prosecution claim at issue in\nArmstrong. (Nov. 9 M&O at 28-31.) Rather than alleging that they in particular are being\ntargeted for removal because of their race—in which case judicial review of their suit would\n'Th is file lists the number of DACA applications approved for the top 25 countries of origin for DACA recipients,\nnot for all countries from which DACA recipients originate.

The Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' allegation that \"[t]he DACA Termination targets\nLatinos and, in particular, Mexicans, and will have a disparate impact on these groups\"( BV\nTAC ^ 197) appears to be a fairly conclusory \"recital[] oft he elements of a cause of action,\"\nwhich the court need not accept as true. Iqbal. 556 U.S. at 678. Their fellow Plaintiffs have,\nhowever, alleged particularized facts in support of this allegation. More importantly, the court\ntakes judicial notice of the USCIS data referenced above, which may be considered on a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion. Kramer v. Time Warner Inc.. 937 F.2d 767, 773( 2d Cir. 1991). The court\ndeclines to dismiss the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' equal-protection claim simply because they did\nnot append the same data to their third amended complaint. Both sets of Plaintiffs have\nadequately alleged that the rescission of the DACA program has a disproportionate impact on\nLatino/a and especially Mexican individuals.\n15\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 16 of 33 PageID #: 7383\nb)  Purpose\nTo establish discriminatory motivation. Plaintiffs must ultimately show that \"invidious\ndiscriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\" in the decision. Arlington Heights. 429 U.S. at\n266. In other words, they must show that Defendants \"selected or reaffirmed a particular course\nof action at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an\nidentifiable group.\" Personnel Adm'r v. Feenev, 442 U.S. 256,279 (1979). But they \"need not\nprove that the 'challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes.'\" Havden v.\nPaterson. 594 F.3d 150, 163 (2d Cir. 2010)( quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265).\n\"Because discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof, litigants may make 'a\nsensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.'\" Id.\n(quoting Arlington Heights. 429 U.S. at 266). In \"extreme\" cases, a facially neutral law may\nhave such a \"clear\" disparate impact,\" unexplainable on grounds other than race,\" that evidence\nof disparate impact alone may suffice to show discriminatory purpose. Arlington Heights. 429\nU.S. at 266 (citing, e.g., Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 356, and Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339\n(I960)). In the absence of such a pattern, however,\" impact alone is not determinative, and the\n[c]ourt must look to other evidence\" to determine if the challenged action was motivated by\ndiscriminatory purpose.

Id. at 266-68; see also Havden v. Paterson. 594 F.3d at 163.\nTo establish discriminatory purpose. Plaintiffs identify a disheartening number of\nstatements made by President Donald Trump that allegedly suggest that he is prejudiced against\nLatinos and, in particular, Mexicans. (BV TAC  89-99; State Pis. Am. Compl. Iff 57-77.)\nThese comments include (1)t hen-candidate Trump's assertions that Mexican immigrants are not\nMexico's \"best,\" but are \"people that have lots of problems,\" \"the bad ones,\" \"criminals, drug\ndealers,[ and] rapists\"( BV TAC  91-93; State Pis. Am. Compl. TIK 58-59);( 2) Trump's\ncharacterization of individuals who protested outside a campaign rally as \"thugs who were flying\nthe Mexican flag\"( State Pis. Am. Compl.^  61);( 3) Trump's statements that a U.S.-bom federal\njudge of Mexican descent could not fairly preside over a lawsuit against Trump's for-profit\neducational company because the judge was \"Mexican\" and Trump intended to build a wall\nalong the Mexican border( BV TAC ^ 96; State Pis. Am. Compl.  62); and (4)p re- and post-\nInauguration characterizations of Latino/a immigrants as criminals, \"animals,\" and \"bad\nhombres\"( BV TAC HI 97, 99; State Pis. Am. Compl. HH 65-66, 70).\nAccepting Plaintiffs' non-conclusory allegations as true and reading all reasonable\ninferences in their favor, the court concludes that these allegations are sufficiently racially\ncharged, recurring, and troubling as to raise a plausible inference that the decision to end the\nDACA program was substantially motivated by discriminatory animus. Although the use of\nracial slurs, epithets, or other racially charged language does not violate equal protection per se.\nit can be evidence that official action was motivated by unlawful discriminatory purposes. See,\ne.g.. Williams v. Bramer. 180 F.3d 699, 706( 5th Cir. 1999); Smith v. Thomburg. 136 F.3d 1070,\n17\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 18 of 33 PageID #: 7385\n1089-90 (6th Cir. 1998); Freeman v. Arpaio. 125 F.3d 732, 738 n.6 (9th Cir. 1997), overruled in\npart on other grounds bv Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 884-85 (9th Cir. 2008); All v.\nConnick. 136 F. Supp. 3d 270,279-80( E.D.N.Y. 2015)( collecting cases). The court is aware of\nno authority holding that this rule does not apply simply because the speaker is, or is running to\nbe, the President oft he United States. The court expresses no view as to whether these\nstatements( which as Defendants note, are not directly connected to the DACA rescission) would\nultimately suffice to provide that the rescission was motivated by discriminatory animus; that is a\nquestion for summary judgment or trial. The court concludes only that Plaintiffs have alleged\nsufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that the DACA rescission violated equal protection,\nand thus to withstand a motion to dismiss.^\nDefendants do not defend the President's comments but argue instead that the court\nshould simply ignore them. First, Defendants suggest that because the President's statements\nwere \"almost all made before he took the oath of office and [were not] made in connection with\nthe[ DACA rescission],\" these comments \"do not tend to show the existence of both\ndiscriminatory intent and discriminatory effect.\" (State MTD at 33.) Defendants cite no\nauthority for the proposition that, to state an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff must point to\nsome evidence that simultaneously demonstrates both discriminatory intent and discriminatory\neffect, or that evinces discriminatory bias directly in connection with the challenged official\naction. To the contrary, Arlington Heights states that courts may consider the background of\n® Because the comments identified above are sufficient to raise a plausible inference of discriminatory purpose, the\ncourt need not decide whether Plaintiffs' remaining allegations support an inference of discriminatory purpose. For\nexample, Plaintiffs allege or argue in their briefs that the President decided to pardon former Maricopa County,\nArizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio( BV TAG ^ 98; State Pis. Am. Compl.  67-69), that he has made offensive statements\nabout Muslims, Native Americans, transgender individuals, and \"shithole countries\"( BV Pis. Opp'n at 19-20), and\nthat, during the campaign, then candidate Trump retweeted a post apparently criticizing former Florida governor Jeb\nBush for speaking \"Mexican\"( BV TAG If 95). The court observes, however, that these allegations would seem to\noffer only weak support, at best, for the notion that the President's alleged decision to end the DAGA program was\nmotivated by desire to harm Latinos and especially Mexicans.\n18\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 19 of 33 PageID #: 7386\nfacially neutral decisions to smoke out whether they were covertly motivated by discriminatory\npurposes. 429 U.S. at 267.\nThe court recognizes that searching for evidence of discriminatory motivation in\ncampaign-trail statements is potentially fraught. Old statements may say little about what lay\nbehind a later decision. Statements made in the throes of a heated race may be \"contradictory or\ninflammatory,\" and considering them may indeed incentivize litigants in future cases to embark\non an \"evidentiary snark hunt\" in search of past comments indicative of some sort of bias.\nWashington v. Trump, 858 F.3d 1168, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 2017)( Kozinski, J., dissenting from\ndenial of reh'g en banc);^  R egents nrbUb\") Order. 2018 WL 401177, at *7( recognizing that\nconsideration of campaign statements \"can readily lead to mischief in challenging the policies of\na new administration\"). Moreover, an equal-protection claim brought against the President raises\ndifficult questions of whether—and,i f so, for how long—^any Executive action\ndisproportionately affecting a group the President has slandered may be considered\nconstitutionally suspect.\nWhile these are all good reasons to tread lightly, the court does not see why it must or\nshould bury its head in the sand when faced with overt expressions of prejudice. Arlington\nHeights calls for a \"sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as\nmay be available,\" and campaign-trail statements by the official allegedly responsible for a\nchallenged policy would seem to fall squarely within this inquiry. Ct IntT Refugee Assistance\nProject V. Trump. 883 F.3d 233, 266 (4th Cir. 2018)( en banc)( declining to consider pre-election\nstatements while noting that they \"certainly provide relevant context when examining the\npurpose\" of a challenged Presidential proclamation suspending entry of individuals from\nspecified countries), pet, for cert, docketed. No. 17-1270. At the very least, one might\n19\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 20 of 33 PageID #: 7387\nreasonably infer that a candidate who makes overtly bigoted statements on the campaign trail\nmight be more likely to engage in similarly bigoted action once in office.\nDefendants' attempts to pass the buck to Acting Secretary Duke are no more persuasive.\nDefendants argue that the President's statements are legally irrelevant because Acting Secretary\nDuke \"was the only official vested with authority...t o make the decision at issue,\" and\nPlaintiffs do not point to similarly objectionable statements by her. (BV MTD at 22; State MTD\nat 34.) To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged racial animus on\nthe part of Acting Secretary Duke or the Attorney General, the court is inclined to agree:\nPlaintiffs have not identified statements by Acting Secretary Duke or the Attorney General that\nwould give rise to an inference of discriminatory motive. Although the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs\ninsinuate that the Attorney General referred to immigrants as \"filth\"( BV TAG H 100; BV Pis.\nOpp'n at 20), his prepared remarks make clear that this term was used only to refer to\ninternational drug-trafficking cartels and the gang MS-13( Dep't of Justice, Press Release,\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks Announcing the Department of Justice's\nRenewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement( Apr. 11, 2017),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attomey-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-announcing-\ndepartment-justice-s-renewed). This comment therefore does not support a plausible inference\nthat the Attomey General was motivated by racial discrimination when he advised that Acting\nSecretary Duke end the DACA program.\nThe court rejects, however. Defendants' remarkable argument that the President\napparently cannot be liable for rescinding the DACA program because only Acting Secretary\nDuke had the legal authority to end that program. (State MTD at 34.) Our Constitution vests\n\"executive Power\" in the President, not in the Secretary of DHS, who reports to the President\n20\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 21 of 33 PageID #: 7388\nand is removable by him at will. U.S. Const., art. II, § 1, cl. 1. This position appears to be at\nodds with the stated position of the President himself, who tweeted that if Congress were unable\nto \"legalize DACA,\" he would \"revisit this issue,\" implying that he (correctly) understands that\nhe has ultimate authority over the program. (Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump),\nTwitter.com (Sept. 5,2017 7:38 PM),\nhttps://twitter.eom/realdonaldtrump/status/905228667336499200.) If, as Plaintiffs allege.\nPresident Trump himself directed the end of the DACA program (e.g.. State Pis. Am. Compl.\n16), it would be surprising if his \"discriminatory intent [could] effectively be laundered by\nbeing implemented by an agency under his control\"( BV Pis. Opp'n at 18). As courts have\nrecognized in far more mundane contexts, liability for discrimination will lie when a biased\nindividual manipulates a non-biased decision-maker into taking discriminatory action. Cf.\nVasquez v. Empress Ambulance Serv.. Inc.. 835 F.3d 267,272-73 (2d Cir. 2016)( discussing\n\"cat's paw\" liability, under which an organization may be held liable for employment\ndiscrimination when a prejudiced subordinate manipulates an unbiased superior into taking\nadverse employment action); Back v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., 365 F.3d 107,\n126 & n.1 8( 2d Cir. 2004)( applying cat's-paw theory to equal-protection claim).\nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' equal-protection claims is\nDENIED.\nB.  Information-Use Policy\nNext, the court considers whether the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs state a claim regarding\nDefendants' alleged changes to DHS's information-use policy.^  The court concludes that they\n'A lthough the State Plaintiffs also asserted similar claims under the Fifth Amendment and principles of equitable\nestoppel (State Pis.

To apply for\nDACA,i ndividuals disclosed \"extensive sensitive and personal information\" about themselves\nand, often, their family members,t o immigration authorities. (BV TAG KK 77-79.) They did so,\nthe third amended complaint alleges, because \"Defendants consistently represented ... that the\ninformation they provided would be protected from disclosure to U.S. Immigrations and\nCustoms Enforcement( \"ICE\") and Customers and Border Protection (\"CBP\")f or immigration\nenforcement proceedings against them and their family members or guardians, except in limited,\ndelineated circumstances.\" (Id. ^ 80.)'*^ Plaintiffs contend that, as part of the DACA rescission,\nhowever,\" DHS has changed its policy ... to remove the limitations on using [this] information\nfor immigration-enforcement purposes.\" (Id.

(Id  179, 181.)\nDefendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because they have not, in fact,\nchanged the information-use policy. (BV MTD at 2, 5, 17-18.) Ordinarily, the court would not\nresolve such a factual dispute on a motion to dismiss. But \"where a conclusory allegation in the\ncomplaint is contradicted by a document attached to the complaint, the document controls and\nthe allegation is not accepted as true.\" Amidax Trading Grp. v.

Here, the November 30 FAQs, which are attached to\nPlaintiffs' complaint, state expressly that the DACA \"information-sharing policy has not\nchanged in any way since it was first announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5,2017 memo\nstarting a wind-down of the DACA policy.\" (Nov. 30 FAQs at Q5; see also USCIS, Frequently\nAsked Questions: Rejected DACA Requests( Last Reviewed/Updated 12/07/2017)( \"Dec. 7\nFAQs\")( Dkt. 113-1 at ECF p.68) at Q5.) While the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs argue that the court\nshould not credit Defendants' unsworn representation that there has been no change to the\ninformation-sharing policy, they do not answer Defendants' argument that they have effectively\n23\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 24 of 33 PageID #: 7391\npleaded themselves out of court by relying on a document that contradicts their otherwise-\nunsupported allegation of a change to DHS's information-use policy, (Compare BV MTD at 17-\n18, vMl BV Pis.

N,Y, Times( Nov, 10,2017)( Dkt, 113-1 at ECF\np,49),) Third, Defendants allegedly rejected renewal requests that were received before October\n5 \"but had been returned to the applicant due to real or perceived clerical errors,\" (BV TAC\n^ 123,) For example, USCIS allegedly rejected one MRNY member's DACA renewal request\nbecause a USCIS employee misread the date on her application-fee check as \"2012,\" rather than\n\"2017,\" (Id H 124,) DHS invited some of these applicants to refile corrected applications, but\n25\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 26 of 33 PageID #: 7393\nwhen they did so, DHS rejected the refiled requests as untimely. (Id  123,127) According to\nMRNY,t his deviated from DHS's prior practice of allowing individuals whose DACA\napplications were rejected for minor clerical errors to correct those errors or submit further\nevidence in support of their applications within a given period oft ime. (Id K 123)\nOn November 15, 2017, Defendants indicated that USCIS would reconsider certain\napplications that were delayed in the mail or improperly rejected. (Id 1129( citing Defs. Nov.\n15, 2017, Letter Regarding USCIS Guidance (Dkt. 108).) USCIS allegedly stated that it would\nreach out to individuals whose applications were rejected as untimely due to mail delays and\nprovide them instructions on how to resubmit their applications. (BV TAC  130.) USCIS\nallegedly has not, however, created an equivalent process for individuals whose applications\nwere rejected due to real or perceived minor clerical errors. (Id  132-34.) MRNY contends\nthat this \"arbitrary and unfair implementation of the October 5, 2017[ DACA renewal request]\ndeadline violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\" by depriving DACA\nrecipients of a liberty or property interest without the process to which they are entitled. (Id\nKl 199-205.)\n1.  Standing\nDefendants first move to dismiss this claim for lack of standing, arguing that MRNY has\nnot alleged that its clients or members suffered an injury-in-fact because \"the injuries on which\n[it]... relies have been remedied.\" (Id at 10.)^^ This argument is meritless.\nDefendants do not contest that MRNY has organizational standing to assert this claim. \"[A]n association has\nstanding to bring suit on behalf of its members when:( a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in then-\nown right;( b)t he interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\" Hunt v. Wash.\nState Apple Advert. Comm'n. 432 U.S. 333,343 (1977). MRNY specifically alleges in the third amended\ncomplaint that a number of its members' and clients' DACA renewal requests were denied due to the alleged\nprocessing errors discussed above. (BV TAC  54-56, 118-24, 127-29, 134.) Ensuring that DACA renewal\nrequests are adjudicated in a fair and orderly manner is clearly consistent with MRNY's purpose of\" empowering\nimmigrant. Latino/a, and working-class communities in New York.\" (Id If 45.) The court is not aware of any\n26\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 27 of 33 PageID #: 7394\nAs their submissions make clear, Defendants have not, in fact, remedied all injuries\nincurred by DACA recipients whose renewal requests were allegedly improperly rejected. For\nMRNY clients and members whose applications arrived late on October 5,\" the agency will\nidentify those individuals affected and invite them to resubmit their DACA requests,\" and \"those\nnot yet contacted .., may affirmatively reach out to the agency, explain their situation, and\nresubmit their request for reconsideration.\" (Id. (citing Dec. 7 FAQs at Q3).) For individuals\nwhose requests were delayed due to postal-service errors and subsequently rejected as imtimely,\n\"USPS is working with USCIS to identify DACA requests that were received after the deadline\ndue to USPS mail-service delays.\" (Id at 11 (quoting Dec. 7 FAQs at Q8).) Once such requests\nare identified,\" USCIS will send affected DACA requestors a letter inviting them to resubmit\ntheir DACA request.\" (Id (quoting Dec. 7 FAQs at Q8).) And individuals whose requests were\nrejected due to perceived clerical errors \"may contact the agency and explain the error believed\nto have been made\";\" [ijdentification of' clear error in the processing of a renewal request' mav\nresult in the agency 'exercising its discretion to review the request again.'\" (Id (quoting Dec. 7\nFAQs at Q7( emphasis added and alterations adopted)).) Thus, with respect to each category of\nallegedly wronged MRNY client or member. Defendants' supposed \"remedy\" is either that\nUSCIS intends to address the injury in the future or that it will allow the injured party to ask it to\nreconsider its decision. The court commends Defendants for taking steps to redress the allegedly\nwrongful denials of these DACA renewal requests. But Defendants err to the extent they\ncontend that, because they have stated that they may reconsider these denials, MRNY members\nand clients whose applications were denied have not suffered injuries-in-fact.  Wong v.\nreason why this claim or the relief requested by MRNY requires the participation of individual DACA requestors.\nAccordingly, the court concludes that MRNY has associational standing to assert this claim.\n27\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 28 of 33 PageID #: 7395\nDaines. 582 F. Supp, 2d 475, 479( S.D.N.Y. 2008)( failure to exhaust administrative remedies\ndoes not implicate Article III injury-in-fact).^^ MRNY has standing to assert this claim on behalf\nof its members and clients who were adversely affected by Defendants' allegedly wrongful\nadjudication of their DACA renewal requests.\nNor is this claim moot. Although Defendants have reconsidered their denial of at least\none MRNY member's DACA renewal request (e.g.. BV TAG ^ 120; BV MTD at 10 n.3),\nMRNY appears that many of its members and clients still await relief( BV Pis. Opp'n at 17-18).\nEven if Defendants had taken action to right all these alleged wrongs,\" [a] defendant's voluntary\ncessation of allegedly unlawful conduct ordinarily does not suffice to moot a case\" unless it is\n\"'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to\nrecur.'\" Friends oft he Earth. Inc. v. Laidlaw Bnvtl. Servs.( TOO.I nc.. 528 U.S. 167,174, 189\n(2000)( quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n. 393 U.S. 199,203\n(1968)). Defendants offer no such assurances here.\nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' sixth claim for\nrelief is DENIED,t o the extent it seeks to dismiss this claim for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n2.  Merits\nNext, Defendants contend that MRNY has failed to state a procedural-due-process claim\nbased on the allegedly wrongful denials of certain DACA recipients' renewal requests. (BV\nMTD at 22-25.) The court agrees in part and disagrees in part.\nDefendants also contend that the court should require MRNY to exhaust administrative remedies before filing\nsuit in federal court. (BV MTD at 11-12.) As the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs note, however( BV Pis. Opp'n at 3, 5),\nDefendants identify no statute that would require them to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. See\nDarbv v. Cisneros. 509 U.S. 137, 153-54 (1993).\n28\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 29 of 33 PageID #: 7396\n\"A procedural due process claim is composed of two elements:( 1)t he existence of a\nproperty or liberty interest that was deprived and (2) deprivation of that interest without due\nprocess.\" Bryant v. N.Y . State Educ. Dep't. 692 F.3d 202, 218( 2d Cir. 2012).\nDefendants focus on the first element, contending that MRNY has not identified a\nconstitutionally protected liberty or property interest \"for the simple reason that DACA\nrecipients have no ... interest in deferred action.\" (BV MTD at 23.) They correctly argue that\nonly benefits to which a person has a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" can support a\nconstitutionally protected liberty or property interest. (Id.( quoting Town of Castle Rock v.\nGonzales. 545 U.S. 748, 756( 2005)).) Because the decision to grant deferred action and work\nauthorization is ultimately discretionary, they say, there can be no constitutionally protected\nliberty or property interest in receiving DACA benefits. (Id. at 23-24; see also 2012 DACA\nMemo at 4.)\nThis argument is partly true. \"In determining whether a given benefits regime creates a\n'legitimate claim of entitlement' to such benefits, we ask whether the statutes and regulations\ngoverning the distribution of benefits 'meaningfully channel[] official discretion by mandating a\ndefined administrative outcome.'\" Barrows v. Burwell. Ill F.3d 106, 113( 2d Cir. 2015)\n(quoting Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, 113( 2d Cir. 2005)). The 2012 DACA Memo only sets\nout criteria for DHS staffs consideration, and there is no guarantee that fulfillment of these\ncriteria will result in a grant of deferred action or work authorization. Under the memo,t he\ndecision to grant or deny those benefits is entirely as a matter of DHS's discretion. Because\nDHS is not effectively required to grant any particular DACA renewal requests, MRNY cannot\nstate a procedural-due-process claim challenging the denial of its members' and clients' requests.\nCf. Yuen Jin v. Mukasev. 538 F.3d 143, 156-57( 2d Cir. 2008)( petitioners for asylum lack\n29\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 30 of 33 PageID #: 7397\nliberty or property interest in discretionary relief). While the denial of those requests may affect\nsome DACA recipients' liberty interests( a question the court need not decide), any such liberty\ninterests are ultimately contingent on DACA beneficiaries' receipt of renewed deferred action, to\nwhich they have no \"legitimate entitlement.\"\nDefendants' argument is also something of a red herring. MRNY contends not only that\nDefendants improperly denied its members' and clients' renewal requests, but that Defendants'\nimplementation of the October 5 deadline improperly denied MRNY's members and clients of\nthe opportunity to be considered for renewal. (BV Pis. Opp'n at 23.) As MRNY points out, the\nDACA Rescission Memo clearly stated that USCIS \"will adjudicate ... properly filed pending\nDACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents\n...f rom current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September 5, 2017] and\nMarch 5, 2018 that have been accepted by[ DHS]a s of October 5, 2017.\" (DACA Rescission\nMemo at 4( emphasis added);^  B V Pis. Opp'n at 23.) While the ultimate decision to grant or\ndeny a renewal request is discretionary, this language makes clear that USCIS would at least\nconsider every \"properly filed\" and timely \"accepted\" renewal request. MRNY has therefore\nsufficiently alleged that its affected members and clients had a legitimate entitlement to submit\ntheir renewal requests. ^Y uen Jin. 538 F.3d at 161 n.l (Sack, J., concurring in part and in the\njudgment)( \"Although asylum is a discretionary form of relief, and the Due Process Clause does\nnot protect benefits that government officials may grant or deny in their discretion, every asylum\napplicant is nonetheless entitled to due process in establishing her eligibility for that form of\nrelief.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted and alteration adopted)).\nMRNY has also sufficiently alleged that at least some of its members and clients were\ndeprived of cognizable interests in the consideration of their DACA renewal requests without\n30\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 31 of 33 PageID #: 7398\ndue process of law. With respect to individuals whose requests were rejected because they were\ndelivered to USCIS P.O. boxes on October 5 but not transferred to the appropriate \"lockbox\"\nuntil the following day, the DACA Rescission Memo was at least ambiguous as to which\napplications would be deemed \"accepted ... as of October 5,2017.\" (DACA Rescission Memo\nat 4.) The DACA Rescission Memo did not state that applications had to be received at a USCIS\nP.O. box by mid- to late aftemoon to be \"accepted,\" or that only those applications redelivered to\na designated USCIS \"lockbox\" by October 5 would be deemed \"accepted,\" raising the possibility\nthat MRNY may be able to show that the denial of these requests violated due process. See\nMever v. Jinkosolar Holdings Co.. 761 F.3d 245, 249( 2d Cir. 2014)( stating that, on a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion,\" dismissal is appropriate only where [plaintiffs] can prove no set of facts\nconsistent with the complaint that would entitle them to relief). Likewise, MRNY has stated a\nclaim on behalf of individuals whose requests were rejected because USCIS staff incorrectly\ndeemed them to be marred by clerical errors. Such applications were, in fact, \"properly filed,\" as\nthe DACA Rescission Memo required, but were only rejected due to errors by USCIS staff. It is\nhard to see how such denials comport with due process.\nMRNY has not stated a claim, however, with respect to DACA recipients whose requests\nwere rejected as untimely after being delayed by the U.S. Postal Service. The court sympathizes\nwith the plight oft hese individuals and commends Defendants for voluntarily taking steps to\naddress this unfortunate situation. The DACA Rescission Memo states, however, that only\n\"properly filed\" and \"accepted\" requests would be considered. It is common for mailing\ndeadlines to be calculated based on when something is postmarked, not when it is actually\ndelivered to the recipient. But USCIS's stated decision to use a \"delivery rule,\" rather than a\n31\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 32 of 33 PageID #: 7399\n\"mailbox rule,\" to determine which requests were timely does not violate the Due Process\nClause.\nLikewise, MRNY has not stated a claim with respect to individuals whose renewal\nrequests were rejected due to actual (as opposed to incorrectly perceived) clerical errors. In light\nof the human consequences of the decision to grant or deny an individual a renewal of DAGA \nbenefits, it may seem overparticular to deny a renewal request because someone \"forg[ot] to\ncheck a box, forg[ot] to sign or sign[ed] in the wrong place, or submitt[ed] a check for what\napplicants previously had to pay for DACA renewal.\" (BV TAG H 141.) The court hopes that\nUSGIS will review these applications sympathetically, understanding the gravity of taking away\nsomeone's livelihood and tentative protection against deportation simply because he or she\nforgot to check a box on a multi-page form. The court cannot, however, require USGIS to do so,\nbecause due process of law does not require the agency to accept incomplete or incorrect renewal\nrequests.\nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs' sixth claim for\nrelieff or failure to state a claim is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. MRNY has\nadequately alleged that the rejection of DAGA renewal requests that arrived late in the day on\nOctober 5,2017, or that were erroneously deemed to contain minor clerical errors, violated\nprocedural due process. MRNY has not, however, stated a procedural-due-process claim on\nbehalf of requestors whose applications arrived after October 5 due to postal delays or actually\ncontained minor clerical errors.\n32\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 215   Filed 03/29/18   Page 33 of 33 PageID #: 7400\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendants' motions to dismiss the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs'\nthird amended complaint and the State Plaintiffs' amended complaint( Dkt. 207 in No. 16-CV-\n4756; No. 71 in No. 17-CV-5228) are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The\nBatalla Vidal Plaintiffs' first, third, and fourth claims for relief are dismissed, and the second\nclaim for relief is dismissed to the extent it alleges that Defendants weakened DHS's\ninformation-use policy. The sixth claim for relief is dismissed in part, as stated above. The State\nPlaintiffs' fifth and sixth claims for relief are dismissed.\nSO ORDERED.\ns/Nicholas G.

Through the Lawyers’ Committee, attorneys have \nrepresented thousands of clients in civil rights cases across the country challenging \ndiscrimination in virtually all aspects of American life.  \nIn furtherance of its commitment to challenge policies that discriminate against \nimmigrants and refugees, the Lawyers’ Committee has filed numerous lawsuits and submitted \namicus briefs in cases involving issues similar to this one.

Despite their \nsignificant contributions, DACA recipients now face the prospect of losing their jobs, homes, \nbusinesses, access to in-state tuition and scholarship assistance, and worse, they fear being \ndetained, deported and being separated from their families and children (at least 200,000 U.S. \nchildren have a parent that is a DACA recipient).   \nAmici understand that policies promoting economic security, diversity and inclusion are \nintegral to the health and well-being of minority communities and the nation.

RESCISSION OF DACA WILL DESTABILIZE THE ECONOMIC HEALTH \nOF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES \nAmici are gravely concerned that the end of DACA will have a destabilizing impact on \nthe economy.  DACA has shown that this country’s economy prospers when undocumented \nimmigrants can integrate into its social fiber.  DACA beneficiaries have become more financially \nstable because the program enabled them to engage in the economic marketplace and their \ncommunities in ways often inaccessible to undocumented immigrants by attending college, \nentering the workforce, starting businesses, and buying homes.  Sixty-nine percent of \nrespondents to a recent study conducted by the Center for American Progress (CAP) who were \nenrolled in DACA reported moving to a job with better pay and fifty-four percent moved to a job \nthat “better fits [their] education and training.”10 In a 2015 survey of 1,750 DACA recipients, \nover three quarters had obtained a new job after receiving protections.11 In a 2014 study \nconducted by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment (IRLE) at the University of \nCalifornia in Los Angeles, 66 percent of respondents enrolled in DACA went from being \nunemployed to employed.   \nCumulatively, CAP estimates that ending DACA would result in the loss of $460 billion \n                                                 \n10 Tom K.

(Aug. 2016), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/daca-four-participation-deferred-\naction-program-and-impacts-recipients. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 174   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 27 PageID #: 6989\n \nfrom the national GDP over the next decade.12  A study by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center \nfound that ending DACA would result in losses of $39.3 billion to Social Security and Medicare \nover the next 10 years, and would result in the removal of an estimated 685,000 workers from \nthe nation’s economy.13  The harm may be felt even more acutely in local immigrant \ncommunities, where DACA recipients have started their own small businesses and bought \nhomes.  \nA.  Diminished Dreams of Entrepreneurship and the Loss of Small Business Owners  \nOur nation has greatly benefitted from entrepreneurial DACA recipients who have \nstimulated economic growth by starting businesses, creating jobs and employing people from \ntheir communities. In recent years, DACA recipients have outpaced Americans in the creation of \nstartups.  A survey from the National Immigration Law Center and CAP estimates that 5 percent \nof DACA recipients overall, including 8 percent of adults over the age of 25, started their own \nsmall business after enrollment in the program.  By contrast, only 3.1 percent of U.S.-born \nresidents are business owners.14   \nThese immigrant-run businesses serve and bind together diverse communities and help \nthem participate more fully in civic life.  For example, one respondent to the NILC and CAP \nsurvey reported, “I started a bookkeeping business which gives me the opportunity to help our \nHispanic community be in compliance with tax law […] If DACA ended, I will not be able to \n                                                 \n12  Tom K.

We are contributing to the economic growth of our local \ncommunity. We pay our fair share of taxes and hire employees […] It will be hard to maintain \nmy business if DACA ended. I depend on my [social security number] for a lot of my business, \nsuch as when getting licenses, permits, leases, and credit.”  15 \nDACA business owners have made innumerable contributions to their communities \nbeyond the services and job opportunities provided by their businesses, and these contributions \nare now jeopardized because of DACA’s termination.  Maria from Phoenix, AZ, told the NILC, \n“Now, 22 years since my arrival and almost 6 years after DACA, I have become a homeowner, a \nbusiness owner of a small boutique, and a regional office manager for a national company. And \nin my spare time I teach English to fellow immigrants like me who only want to contribute. I sit \nin my office thinking about a promotion that I am unwilling to take because I have the \nuncertainty of what will happen tomorrow. It saddens me to think that tomorrow I may not be \nable grow my business or even live in my own home.”16 \nB. The Decline in Homeownership and Resulting Harm to Communities \n \nFor many recipients, DACA provided an opportunity to achieve financial security for \nthemselves and their families and contribute to the economic stability of their communities \nthrough homeownership. The online real-estate database company Zillow estimates that 123,000 \nDACA recipients are homeowners and, indeed, purchased their homes after their DACA \n                                                 \n15 Tom K. Wong et al., DACA Recipients’ Economic and Educational Gains Continue to Grow, Ctr. for Am. \nProgress (Aug. 28, 2017), https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/08/28/437956/daca-\nrecipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow/. \n16 Stories in Defense of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Nat.

Yet, only 46 percent of \nHispanics and 42 percent of African Americans own a home compared to 73.5 percent of \nwhites.19  DACA allowed undocumented immigrants who had previously faced barriers to \nhomeownership because of their status to accumulate long-term wealth and security.  Due to the \ntermination of DACA, recipients who are homeowners face an uncertain future, as property \noptions are not immediately clear.

DACA TERMINATION WILL IMPAIR OUR COUNTRY’S DIVERSITY AND \nLEADERSHIP \nTerminating DACA would exclude the talents, ideas, work ethic and experiences of \nimmigrants who seek only to help build and protect our nation and contribute to this nation’s rich \ncultural tapestry and economic strength.  Protections afforded under DACA have enabled \nmembers of immigrant communities to attend educational institutions, pursue training \nopportunities and aspire to positions of leadership. Twenty percent, or 241,000, of the \nimmediately eligible DACA population has enrolled in college.21  Approximately 57,000 DACA \nrecipients have earned their bachelor’s degree and many more are on track to do the same. 22   \nA.  DACA Serves as a Necessary Pathway to Leadership in Immigrant Communities \nIt is a well-accepted precept that “universities . . . represent the training ground for a large \nnumber of our Nation’s leaders,” and thus “it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly \nopen to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 \nU.S. 306, 332 (2003). Terminating DACA will sever this pathway to leadership and prevent \nupward mobility within immigrant communities.   \nLeaders like DACA recipients Cesar Vargas, Jessica Rubio and Juventino Meza have \nmade indelible marks in their communities. Mr. Vargas came to the United States from Mexico \nat the age of five.  He is a national immigration reform advocate who “made history when a New \nYork court paved the way for him to become the first undocumented immigrant to practice law \nin the state,” with the support of the New York State Attorney General.23   Ms. Rubio came to the \n                                                 \n21 Randy Capps, Michael Fix, and Jie Zong, The Education and Work Profiles of the DACA Population, Migration \nPol’y Inst.

She graduated college and founded a nonprofit \norganization that prepares low-income high school students for college in Arizona.   Mr. Meza \ncame to the United States when he was fifteen years old, became the first in his family to go to \ncollege, and while in college co-founded a non-profit organization that works on behalf of \nundocumented youth.   The progress and stability of not just immigrant communities, but all \ncommunities, are dependent on the existence of community leaders like Mr. Vargas. \nB.  DACA Promotes Increased Exposure to Diversity in Workplaces and \nEducational Institutions, Which is Critical to Societal Progress and the \nCountry’s Ability to Foster Culturally Competent Leaders \nIn addition to serving as a pathway to better opportunities for recipients, DACA has \nexposed U.S born residents in workplaces and educational institutions to diverse individuals, \nperspectives and ideas.  Racial and ethnic diversity are not just necessary and beneficial to \nimmigrant communities, but of critical importance to our society as a whole. As the Supreme \nCourt has explained, “[t]hese benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses \nhave made clear that the skills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be \ndeveloped through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.” Grutter \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 330 (2003); see also Douglas Laycock, The Broader Case for \nAffirmative Action: Desegregation, Academic Excellence, and Future Leadership, 78 TUL. L. \nREV. 1767, 1769-76 (2004) (explaining how Grutter extended the importance of diversity in \neducation to the development of leaders).  Indeed, “the ‘nation’s future depends upon leaders \ntrained through wide exposure’ to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of \nmany peoples.” Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) (quoting \nKeyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967)).  \nOur nation benefits greatly from residents who are better equipped to handle 21st century \nproblems in a world that is increasingly technologically and economically interconnected. As our \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 174   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 27 PageID #: 6994\n \nsociety grows more diverse and our economy more internationally focused, the states that wish \nto remain competitive will increasingly require not only racially and culturally diverse leaders, \nbut leaders who have been exposed to a diverse community.  In late 2016, a group of more than \n700 college and university presidents issued a statement in support of DACA, noting among \nother comments “the critical benefits of this program for our students, and the highly positive \nimpacts on our institutions and communities.”24  The presidents’ joint statement noted:  \nDACA beneficiaries on our campuses have been exemplary student scholars and \nstudent leaders, working across campus and in the community.  With DACA our \nstudents and alumni have been able to pursue opportunities in business, education, \nhigh tech, and the non-profit sector; they have gone to medical school, law school, \nand graduate schools in numerous disciplines.  They are actively contributing to \ntheir local communities and economies.25  \n \nMajor corporations, such as Starbucks and Microsoft, have stressed the importance of \ndiversity within their workforce. Starbucks interim general counsel, Paul F. Mutty, noted that \nemploying DACA recipients  \nsupports  the  kind  of  diverse  and  creative  workplace  we  seek  to  create  and \nsustain…Dreamers who have gained employment under DACA represent so many \nof our customers—customers who are either immigrants themselves or the children, \ngrandchildren or friends of immigrants…In addition to working… our DACA \npartners are going back to school, taking care of their families, and working toward \nrealizing their own American dream.26       \n \nMr. Mutty punctuates the sentiment shared not only by major corporations, but by \nschools, universities and communities, by stating, “We are a better company because of their \ncontributions.”27 Not allowing DACA recipients to continue their employment or their education \nwill create a void in diversity that will harm our country’s ability to remain competitive. \n \n                                                 \n24 Pomona College, College & University Presidents Call for U.S. to Uphold and Continue DACA (Nov. 21, 2016), \nhttps://www.Pomona.edu/news/2016/11/21-college-university-presidents-call-us-uphold-and-contine-DACA. \n25 Id.  \n26 Affidavit of Paul M.

DACA REVOCATION WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR \nTEACHERS AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE \n \nDACA teachers are a significant asset to our nation’s public schools, especially in cities \nwith large, immigrant student populations.  An estimated 20,000 DACA recipients are employed \nas educators throughout the U.S., and many of them possess in-demand bilingual language \nskills.28  In certain states, the numbers of DACA recipient educators are substantial:  5,000 in \nCalifornia, and 2,000 each in New York and Texas.29  There is currently a severe shortage \nnationally of teachers in the public education sector, estimated to be as high as 327,000 public \neducators.30  The consequences of a shortage in public education employment are well known:  \nlarger class sizes, fewer teacher aides, fewer guidance counselors, fewer extra-curricular \nactivities.31  Furthermore, in the past few decades, the racial makeup of the country’s student \npopulation has drastically shifted, but the overwhelming majority of public school teachers \ncontinue to be white.32 Public schools have seen increased enrollment by students of color, \nespecially by Latinos.33 By 2025, it is expected that a majority of high school graduates will be \n                                                 \n28 Moriah Balingit, As DACA winds down, 20,000 educations are in limbo, Wash.

For many \ncommunities, DACA teachers mirror the experiences of their immigrant students, which informs \ntheir teaching with cultural competence, helps develop positive relationships with students and \ncreates more welcoming school environments. 35  Recent research has demonstrated that when \nstudents of color have teachers from similar backgrounds, they are more likely to succeed.  A \nrecent study published by the Institute of Labor Economics found that “low-income black male \nstudents in North Carolina who have just one black teacher in third, fourth, or fifth grade are less \nlikely to drop out of high school and more likely to consider attending college.”36  Viridiana \nCarrizales of Teach For America aptly noted that “[w]e cannot afford to lose so many teachers \nand impact so many students…[e]very time a student loses a teacher, that is a disruption in the \nstudent’s learning.” 37   \nAs Vanessa Lina, a DACA recipient who taught as a Teach for America teacher and now \nserves as a recruiter, told The New York Times:  “We’re going to lose leaders and lose teachers – \nit’s not only their presence, but having a teacher that can share the same experiences that you \n                                                 \n34 Id. \n35 Lisette Partelow, America Needs More Teachers of Color, (September 14, 2017, 9:00 am), \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2017/09/14/437667/america-needs-teachers-color-\nselective-teaching-profession/ \n36 Seth Gershenson and others, The Long-Run Impacts of Same-Race Teachers, (Bonn, Germany: Institute of Labor \nEconomics, 2017), available at http://ftp.iza.org/dp10630.pdf \n37 Greg Toppo, 20,000 DACA teachers at risk — and your kids could feel the fallout, too (Oct. 11, 2017, 7:00 AM), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/10/11/thousands-daca-teachers-risk/752082001/. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 174   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 27 PageID #: 6997\n \npossibly had growing up … Their advocacy, their leadership, their resilience is extraordinary \nbecause of their own personal journey.”38 \nDiversity in teaching is a critical to educational equity, and students of all racial and \nethnic backgrounds, especially immigrant students benefit from having DACA educators.  \nSchool environments that reflect the diversity of communities, the country, and the world help \nopen students’ minds to new perspectives and actively engage them in learning.  Prejudice and \nbias is countered in schools and communities when respect for diversity is taught, modeled, and \nexperienced firsthand by children.39  The loss of 20,000 DACA teachers will cause severe and \nlasting harm to students and their educational trajectories, and more broadly our country which \ndepends on the great talent of future generations.   \nIV.  ELIMINATION OF DACA STATUS WILL ALSO HARM OUR MILITARY \nAND RECIPIENTS PROUDLY SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES  \n \nDiversity is also critically important to the military. Beginning in 2014, the Pentagon \nallowed DACA recipients to enroll in a program known as Military Accessions Vital to the \nNational Interest (“MAVNI”).  As the Defense Department has explained, MAVNI allows fast-\ntracked citizenship for enrollees “whose skills are considered to be vital to the national interest,” \nincluding “physicians, nurses, and certain experts in language with associated cultural \nbackgrounds.”40  The policy behind MAVNI is to “ensure[] that the sacrifice of non-citizens \n                                                 \n38 Liz Robbins, For Teachers Working Through DACA, a Bittersweet Start to the School Year, N.Y.

As \n  an organization founded by immigrants and sworn to protect the interests of \nAnti- religious and ethnic minorities, ADL believes that when our nation’s values \nDefamation  are threatened, we are duty-bound to return to the founding principles that \nLeague  propelled this nation of immigrants.  As such, ADL has advocated for fair and \njust immigration policies for more than a century, including a pathway to \ncitizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to this country as \nchildren.  As part of its commitment to create an ever-more just and inclusive \nsociety, ADL has filed amicus briefs in numerous cases challenging policies \nthat undermine the ideal of America as a nation of immigrants.  At stake in this \ncase are the lives of 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to \nthe United States as children, their families, communities, and all of us who \ndepend on a future that embraces diversity as a strength. \n \n   \n  Advocates for Youth is a national reproductive and sexual health/rights \n  organization that centers the needs and voices of young people.

At Advocates for Youth, we center young people, \npeople of color, LGBTQ communities, and children of immigrants—all of \nwho would be disproportionately impacted if DACA was rescinded. We are \ncommitted to the health and safety of all young people, and the President \nshould be as well. This shameful decision will not deter us from working to \nensure the reproductive and sexual health and rights of all young people are \nrealized regardless of citizenship status. As a nation, we must find the moral \nclarity to end attacks on immigrants. \n \n   \n  The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice (“LCCR”) \nThe Lawyers'  fosters equal opportunity and fights discrimination on behalf of people of color \nCommittee  and immigrants.

As part of this work, LCCR has long sought to further immigrant \nEconomic  justice through impact litigation.  Immigrant entrepreneurs also are assisted \nJustice  through LCCR’s Economic Justice Project.  LCCR thus has a strong interest in \nensuring that DACA recipients and DACA-eligible immigrants are not \nunlawfully deprived of economic, educational, and other opportunities through \nrescission of the DACA program. \n     \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 174   Filed 12/22/17   Page 25 of 27 PageID #: 7001\n \n  The Mississippi Center for Justice, the Deep South Affiliate of the Lawyers \n  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public interest \n  law organization founded in 2003 in Jackson, Mississippi and  committed to \n  advancing racial and economic justice.

GARAUFIS, United States District Judge. \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security created the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program.  That program permitted certain individuals without \nlawful immigration status who entered the United States as children to obtain \"deferred \naction\"-contingent, discretionary relief from deportation-and authorization to work legally in \nthis country.  Since 2012, nearly 800,000 DACA recipients have relied on this program to work, \nstudy, and keep building lives in this country. \n1 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 2 of 55 PageID #: 7297\nOn September 5, 2017, Defendants announced that they would gradually end the DACA \nprogram.1  (Letter from Jefferson B.

The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") would consider pending \nDACA applications and renewal requests, as well as promptly filed renewal requests by DACA \nbeneficiaries whose benefits were set to expire within six months, but would reject all other \napplications and renewal requests.  (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.)  Plaintiffs in the above-\ncaptioned cases promptly challenged Defendants' decision on a number of grounds, including, \nmost relevant for purposes of this Memorandum and Order, that the decision violated the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.

Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 537 (2009) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and in the judgment).  To that end, the \nAP A authorizes parties harmed by federal agencies to obtain judicial review of agency decisions. \n5 U.S.C. § 702.  The reviewing court must set aside \"action, findings, [or] conclusions\" that are, \namong other things, \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.\"  Id. § 706(2)(A).3  Review under this \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard is \"narrow,\" \nand the court may not \"substitute its judgment for that of the agency\"; instead, the court \nconsiders only whether the agency's decision \"was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.\" \nMotor Vehicle Mfts. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43, 52 \n(1983) (\"State Farm\").  If the agency decision \"examine[d ] the relevant data and articulate[ d] a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a 'rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made,\"' the court will uphold the agency's decision.  Id. at 43 (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  If, however, the agency's decision \n\"relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the \nevidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in \nview or the product of agency expertise,\" that decision must be set aside.  Id. \nReview under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard is generally limited to the agency's \nstated rationale for its decision, State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 \n(1973) (per curiam), and to the \"full administrative record that was before the [agency] at the \ntime [it] made [its] decision,\" Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, \n3  On November 9, 2017, the court rejected Defendants' arguments that judicial review under the APA was \nunavailable because the decision to rescind the DACA program was \"committed to agency discretion by law.\" \n(Nov. 9, 2017, Mem. & Order (Dkt. 104) at 20-28.) \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 4 of 55 PageID #: 7299\n420 (1971) (\"Overton Park\").  The court \"may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's \naction that the agency itself has not given.\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citing SEC v. Chenery \nCorp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947) (\"Chenery II\")); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943) \n(\"Chenery I\").  Nor may the court uphold agency action based on \"post hoc rationalizations of \nagency actioiL\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50; see also Williams Gas Processing- Gulf Coast Co., \nL.P. v. FERC, 373 F.3d 1335, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J.) (\"It is axiomatic that [the \ncourt] may uphold agency orders based only on reasoning that is fairly stated by the agency in \nthe order under review; post hoc rationalizations by agency counsel will not suffice.\" (intemal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)). \nThe AP A thus sometimes places courts in the formalistic, even perverse, position of \nsetting aside action that was clearly within the responsible agency's authority, simply because \nthe agency gave the wrong reasons for, or failed to adequately explain, its decision.  Ihg,, State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 42-43, 48-56; Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416,420.  Based on the present \nrecord, these appears to be just such cases. \nDefendants indisputably can end the DACA program.  Nothing in the Constitution or the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S. C. § 1101 et seq. (the \"INA\"), requires immigration \nauthorities to grant deferred action or work authorization to individuals without lawful \nimmigration status.  The DACA program, like prior deferred-action and similar discretionary \nrelief programs, simply reflected the Obama Administration's determination that DRS's limited \nenforcement resources generally should not be used to depott individuals who were brought to \nthe United States as children, met educational or military-service requirements, and lacked \nmeaningful criminal records.  (Mem. from Janet Napolitano, Sec'y, DHS, Exercising \nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 5 of 55 PageID #: 7300\nat 1-2 (June 15, 2012) (Admin. R. 1-2) (the \"2012 DACA Memo\").)  New Administrations may, \nhowever, alter or abandon their predecessors' policies, even if these policy shifts may impose \nstaggering personal, social, and economic costs. 4 \nThe question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA \nprogram, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so.  Based on its review of \nthe record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.  First, the decision to \nend the DACA program appears to rest exclusively on a legal conclusion that the program was \nunconstitutional and violated the AP A and INA.  Because that conclusion was erroneous, the \ndecision to end the D ACA program carmot stand.  Second, this erroneous conclusion appears to \nhave relied in part on the plainly incorrect factual premise that courts have recognized \n\"constitutional defects\" in the somewhat analogous Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\") program.  Third, Defendants' decision appears to be \ninternally contradictory, as the means by which Defendants chose to \"wind down\" the program \n(namely, by continuing to adjudicate certain DACA renewal applications) cannot be reconciled \nwith their stated rationale for ending the program (namely, that DACA was unconstitutional). \nAny of these flaws would support invalidating the DACA rescission as arbitrary and capricious. \nBefore this court, Defendants have attempted to reframe their decision as motivated by \n\"litigation risk.\"  They contend that the decision to end the DACA program was reasonable in \nlight of the prospect that Texas and several other states would seek to amend their complaint in \nTexas v. United States, No. 14-CV-254 (S.D. Tex.), to challenge the DACA program; that the \n4t(h eeTs thmimeasanet yicn ohgse ttlshp efau rcelo  bdsrtesite aofisfl e tfdhil eei ndD  bgAryeC aaAmte rirc elise cninigs ttshhio einsne  ot hcveae sree xtsh.h ei (bnSietesxe tt,o  de .ePgcl.aa, idBnetr iaifeft Sf$ o' 4mf6 A0o.tm3io ibnciisl  lCfioournr  ipainree  ll1oim1s4ti  nGCaDorymP  ipananjnudin e$cs2t i4(oD.n6k,  bta.i nl1ldi6 oi0nn)   in \nlost Social Security and Medicare tax contributions).) \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 6 of 55 PageID #: 7301\nU.S. District Court for the Southem District of Texas would issue a nationwide injunction ending \nthe program; and that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Comt \nwould affirm that injunction.  (Defs. Opp'n to Pis. Mots. for Prelim. Inj. (Dkt. 239) at I, 10-11, \n21-24.)  The Administrative Record does not support Defendants' contention that they decided to \nend the DACA program for this reason.  Even if it did, reliance on this \"litigation risk\" rationale \nwould have been arbitrary and capricious, in light of Defendants' failure to explain their decision \nor to consider any factors that might have weighed against ending the DACA program.  And \neven if this \"litigation risk\" rationale were both suppotted by the Administrative Record and a \nreasonable basis for rescinding the DACA program, the comt would neve1theless likely set \nDefendants' decision aside, as the court cannot say that any ofthe aforementioned errors were \nharmless, for purposes of review under the AP A. \nAccordingly, the comt concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir substantive AP A claims.  Because Plaintiffs also satisfy the remaining requirements for the \ncourt to issue a preliminary injunction, the court ENJOINS Defendants from rescinding the \nDACA program, pending a decision on the merits of these cases.  Defendants thus must continue \nprocessing DACA renewal requests under the same terms and conditions that applied before \nSeptember 5, 2017, subject to the limitations described below.  The scope of this preliminary \ninjunction conforms to that previously issued by the U.S. District Court of the Northem District \nof Califomia.  See Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject-Matter \nJurisdiction and Granting Provisional Relief(Dkt. 234), Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. U.S. \nDep't of Homeland Sec., No. 3:17-CV-5211 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2018) (\"Regents\") (Alsup, J.), \npet. for cert. before judgment filed, No. 17-1003. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 7 of 55 PageID #: 7302\nThe court makes clear, however, what this order is not. \n•  This order does not hold that the rescission ofDACA was unlawful.  That \nquestion is for summary judgment, not motions for a preliminary injunction.  Cf. \nHamilton Watch Co. v. Bemus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738,742 (2d Cir. 1953) \n(\"[A] preliminary injunction ... is, by its very nature, interlocutory, tentative, \nprovisional, ad interim, impermanent, mutable, not fixed or final or conclusive, \ncharacterized by its for-the-time-beingness.\"). \n•  This order does not hold that Defendants may not rescind the DACA \nprogram.  Even if the court ultimately finds that Defendants' stated rationale for \nending the DACA program was legally deficient, the ordinmy remedy is for the \ncourt to remand the decision to DHS for reconsideration.  See Chenery I, 318 U.S. \nat 94-95.  On remand, DHS \"might later, in the exercise of its lawful discretion, \nreach the same result for a different reason.\"  FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 \n(1998). \n•  This order does not require Defendants to grant any particular DACA \napplications or renewal requests.  Restoring the DACA program to the status \nquo as of September 4, 2017, does not mean that every DACA recipient who \nrequests renewal of his or her deferred action and work authorization will receive \nit.  The DACA program identified \"criteria [that] should be satisfied before an \nindividual is considered for an exercise ofprosecutorial discretion.\"  (2012 \nDACA Memo at 1.)  It did not require immigration officials to defer action \nagainst any individuals who met these criteria; to the contrary, the 2012 DACA \nMemo stated that DHS would exercise prosecutorial discretion \"on an individual \nbasis\" and would not \"provide any assurance that relief will be granted in all \ncases.\"  @.,at 2-3.)  Preserving the status quo means only that Defendants must \ncontinue considering D ACA applications and renewal requests, not that they must \ngrant all such applications and requests.  (See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration \nServs., Frequently Asked Questions at Q6 (Apr. 25, 2017) (\"Apr. 25 DACA \nFAQs\"), Ex. 41 to State Pls. Mot. (Dkt. 97-2, No. 17-CV-5228) at ECF p.186.) \n•  This order does not prevent Defendants' from revoking individual DACA \nrecipients' deferred action or work authorization.  Under the 2012 DACA \nMemo, DHS may terminate a DACA recipient's deferred action \"at any time, \nwith or without a Notice oflntent to Terminate, at [its] discretion.\"  (Apr. 25 \nDACA FAQs at Q27.)  Maintaining the status quo does nothing to alter that. \nBecause the court issues the preliminary injunction requested by Plaintiffs, the Batalla \nVidal Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (Dkt. 124) is DENIED as moot.  The court will \naddress by separate order Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' operative complaints. \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 8 of 55 PageID #: 7303\n(Defs.

BACKGROUND \nThe court provides a brief history of immigration authorities' use of\"defelTed action\" \nand similar discretionary-relief programs, the DACA and DAP A programs, and this litigation to \noffer context for the discussion that follows.  For further background, the reader may consult this \ncomt's prior orders (see Oct. 3, 2017, Order (Dkt. 72); Oct. 17, 2017, Mem. & Order (Dkt. 86); \nOct. 19,2017, Mem. & Order (Dkt. 90); Nov. 9, 2017, Mem. & Order (Dkt. 104); Nov. 20,2017, \nOrder (Dkt. 109); Dec. 15,2017, Order (Dkt. 122); Jan. 8, 2018, Mem. & Order (Dkt. 233)), the \nNorthern District of California's opinion in Regents, 2018 WL 339144, at* 1-8, and the opinion \nof the Office of Legal Counsel regarding DAP A (see The Depattment of Homeland Security's \nAuthority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to \nDefer Removal of Others, 38 Op. O.L.C. at 1 (2014) (Admin. R. 4) (\"OLC Op.\")). \nA.  History of Deferred Action \n\"The Government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of \nimmigration and the status of aliens.\"  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012).  That \npower derives from the Constitution, which authorizes Congress \"[t]o establish a uniform Rule \nof Naturalization,\" U.S. Const. att. I., § 8, cl. 4, and from the Government's \"inherent power as \nsovereign to control and conduct relations with foreign nations.\"  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 395. \nActing under this authority, the Government has created an \"extensive and complex\" statutory \nand regulatory regime governing, among other things, who may be admitted to the United States, \nwho may work here, and who may be removed from the country.  Id.; see id. at 395-97. \nNot all \"removable\" aliens are, in fact, deported from this country.  Immigration officials \n\"cannot act against each technical violation of the statute[s they are] charged with enforcing,\" \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 9 of 55 PageID #: 7304\nbut must determine which enforcement actions are worthwhile.  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n821,831 (1985); Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11,15-16 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \"A principal feature of \nthe removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials,\" who \"as an initial \nmatter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all,\" and, \"[i]f removal \nproceedings commence,\" may decide whether removable aliens wanant asylum or \"other \ndiscretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without fmmal \nremoval.\"  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396; see also Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., \n525 U.S. 471,483 (1999) (\"AAADC\") (observing that throughout the removal process, \nimmigration officials have \"discretion to abandon the endeavor\").  Immigration officials' \nenforcement discretion is a practical necessity as well as a legal reality:  By one recent estimate, \nthere are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens present in the United States, of whom \nDHS has the resources to remove fewer than 400,000 per year-about 3.5 percent of the total. \n(OLC Op. at 1.) \nOver the years, Congress and the Executive Branch have developed a number of means \nby which immigration officials may exercise their discretion not to deport removable aliens. \n\"Some of these discretionary powers have flowed from statute,\" such as \"parole,\" see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(5)(A), and \"temporary protected status,\" see id. § 1254a.  Regents, 2018 WL 339144, \nat *2; see also, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1229b (cancellation of removal); id. § 1229c (voluntary \ndeparture).  Others, such as \"defened enforced departure\" or \"extended voluntary departure,\" \nhave been ad hoc exercises of executive authority, grounded in the Executive Branch's \nresponsibility for conducting foreign relations and enforcing immigration laws, rather than in \nexpress congressional authorization.  Regents, 2018 WL 339144, at *2; OLC Op. at 12 & n.5. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 10 of 55 PageID #: 7305\nThe cases before this court concern one such form of discretionary relief.  \"Deferred \naction\" is a longstanding practice by which the Executive Branch exercises its discretion to \nabandon, or to decline to undertake, deportation proceedings \"for humanitarian reasons or simply \nfor its own convenience.\"  AAADC, 525 U.S. at 484; see also Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 16 \n(\"' [D]eferred action' ... entails temporarily postponing the removal of individuals unlawfully \npresent in the United States.\").  By granting a removable alien deferred action, immigration \nofficials convey that they do not currently intend to remove that individual from the country.  As \nsuch, deferred action offers the recipient some assurance-however non-binding, unenforceable, \nand contingent on the recipient's continued good behavior-that he or she may remain, at least \nfor now, in the United States.  Additionally, recipients of deferred action may apply for \nauthorization to work legally in the United States, provided that they \"establish[] an economic \nnecessity for employment.\"  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) \n(excluding from the definition of \"unauthorized aliens,\" who may not be knowingly employed in \nthe United States, aliens \"authorized to be ... employed ... by the Attorney General\"). \nDeferred action does not, however, confer lawful immigration status, a pathway to citizenship, or \na defense to removal, and is revocable by immigration authorities.

DACA and DAPA   \nOn June 15,2012, then-DRS Secretary Janet Napolitano issued the 2012 DACA Memo, \nwhich stated that DRS would consider granting deferred action to certain individuals without \nlawful immigration status who entered the United States as children.  (2012 DACA Memo at 1.) \nSecretary Napolitano stated that DRS was implementing this program as an \"exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion\" in the enforcement of immigration laws, to \"ensure that ... \nenforcement resources are not expended on ... low priority cases.\"  (Id.)  Under the 2012 DACA \nMemo, individuals were eligible for consideration for deferred action ifthey (1) \"came to the \nUnited States under the age of sixteen\"; (2) had \"continuously resided in the United States for \na[t]least five years preceding the date of this memorandum and [were] present in the United \nStates\" on that date; (3) were \"in school,\" had \"graduated from high school,\" had obtained \nGEDs, or were honorably discharged veterans of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard; (4) had not \nbeen convicted of felonies, significant misdemeanors, or multiple misdemeanors, or been \ndeemed to \"otherwise pose[] a threat to national security or public safety\"; and (5) were not \nabove the age of thirty.  (Id.)  DACA applications from individuals meeting these criteria would \nbe evaluated \"on an individual\" or \"case-by-case\" basis and would not necessarily be \"granted in \nall cases.\"  (Id. at 2.)  The 2012 DACA Memo \"confer[r ed] no substantive right, immigration \nstatus or pathway to citizenship.\"  (IQ, at 2-3.) \nIn late 2014, DRS announced the DAP A program, which would have granted deferred \naction to certain parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.  (Mem. from Jeh \nCharles Johnson, Sec'y of DRS, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals \nWho Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to Certain Individuals Who Are the \nParents ofU.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents (Nov. 20, 2014) (the \"2014 DAPA Memo\") \n(Admin R. 40).)  As part of that program, then-DRS Secretary Jeh Johnson directed U.S. \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 13 of 55 PageID #: 7308\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") \"to establish a process, simi!aT to DACA, for \nexercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of defened action, on a case-by-case basis,\" \nto certain individuals who, among other things, lacked formal immigration status and had a son \nor daughter who was a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.  (Id. at 1.)  Secretary Johnson \nalso announced that the DACA program would be expanded by (I) removing tbe requirement \nthat DACA applicants be under the age of 30 as of June 2012; (2) extending tbe duration of the \ndeferred action and work authorization obtained through the program from two to three years; \nand (3) adjusting the date-of-entry requirement to open DACA to individuals brought to the \nUnited States between June 15,2007, and January 1, 2010.  Q<h at 3-4 (the \"DACA \nExpansion\").) \nC.  The Texas Litigation \nFollowing DRS's issuance of the 2014 DAPA Memo, Texas and 25 other states filed suit \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging tbat the DAP A program \nviolated the APA and the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Canst. art. II,§ 3.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 598 (S.D. Tex. 2015).  On February 16,2015, after \nconcluding that Texas and its fellow plaintiffs had standing to sue, Judge Andrew Hanen \ndetermined that tbey were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that DAPA constituted a \n\"legislative\" or \"substantive\" rule that, under tbe APA  , should have been made through notice \nand-comment rulemaking procedures.  Id. at 664-72.  In particular, Judge Harren found that the \n2014 DAPA Memo, \"[a]t a minimum, ... 'severely restrict[e d]' any discretion that Defendants \nargue exists\" in the adjudication ofDAPA applications, and that DHS had not genuinely \nexercised discretion in reviewing DACA applications.  Id. at 669 & n.l 01.  The court issued a \nnationwide injunction against the implementation of both the DAPA program and the DACA \nExpansion.  Id. at 677-78. \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 14 of 55 PageID #: 7309\nThe Fifth Circuit denied a stay of the preliminary injunction, 787 F. 3d 733, 743 (5th Cir. \n2015), and affirmed the district court on two independent, alternative grounds, 809 F.3d 134, 178 \n(5th Cir. 2015) (revised).  First, the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling that the \nplaintiff states were likely to prevail on the merits of their claim that the DAPA   program was \ninvalid because it was not developed through notice-and-conunent rulemaking.  See id. at 170-\n78.  In particular, the Fifth Circuit found that Judge Hanen did not clearly err in finding that \n\"[n]othing about DAPA   genuinely leaves the agency and its [employees] free to exercise \ndiscretion,\" based partly on evidence that supposedly showed that USCIS exercised little case \nby-case discretion in adjudicating DACA applications.  Id. at 172 (quoting 86 F. Supp. 3d at 670 \n(alterations in original)); see id. at 172-78. \nSecond, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the plaintiff states were likely to prevail on the \nmerits of their claim that the DAP A program was substantively arbitrary and capricious because, \nin that court's view, the program was contrary to the INA.  See id. at 178-86.  The Fifth Circuit \nobserved that \"Congress has enacted an intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a lawful \ninunigration classification from their children's immigration status,\" in the f01m of family \npreference visas, id. at 179, and cancellation of removal and adjustment of status, id. at 180. \nWhile admitting that DAP A did not \"confer the full panoply of benefits that a visa gives,\" the \nFifth Circuit held that D AP A nevertheless conflicted with these statutory forms of relief by \npe1mitting \"illegal aliens to receive the benefits of lawful presence\" without meeting the \nstringent requirements applicable to these provisions.  See id. at 180.  Similarly, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that DAPA   conflicted with the INA by providing an easier path to \"lawful presence\" and \nwork authorization for approximately four million undocumented inunigrants-a question of \ngreat national importance that Congress could not have intended to delegate implicitly to DRS. \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 15 of 55 PageID #: 7310\nSee id. at 180-81.  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there was a long history of discretionary \nrelief programs but held that past practice was not dispositive of DAP A's legality and \ndistinguished DAPA from past programs on the grounds that such programs were '\"done on a \ncountry-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or natural disasters,\"' id. at 184 \n(quoting CRS Rep. at 9); used as a \"bridge[] from one legal status to another,\" id.; or \"interstitial \nto a statutory legalization scheme,\" such as the Family Fairness program enacted by the Reagan \nand George H.W. Bush Administrations, id. at 185.  Accordingly, \"DAP A [wa]s foreclosed by \nCongress's careful plan ... and therefore was properly enjoined.\"  Id. at 186. \nThe Supreme Court granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari, 136 S. Ct. \n906 (2016), and affirmed the decision of the Fifth Circuit by an equally divided court, 136 S. Ct. \n2271 (Mem.). \nD.  The DACA Rescission \nOn January 25, 2017, the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump issued an executive \norder stating that \"[i]t is the policy of the executive branch to ... [ e] nsure the faithful execution \nof the immigration laws of the United States,\" and that \"[w]e cannot faithfully execute the \nimmigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens \nfrom potential enforcement.\"  Exec. Order 13,768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the \nUnited States (Jan. 25, 2017), 82 Fed. Reg. 8799.  Shortly thereafter, then-DHS Secretary John \nF. Kelly issued a memorandmn implementing this executive order by rescinding \"all existing \nconflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding enforcement of our immigration \nlaws and priorities for removal,\" except for the DACA and DAPA programs, which he left in \nplace.  (Mem. from John F. Kelly, Sec'y, DHS, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve \nthe National Interest at 2 (Feb. 20, 2017) (Admin. R. 230).) \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 16 of 55 PageID #: 7311\nFour months later, Secretary Kelly issued another memorandum rescinding DAPA and \nthe DACA Expansion in light of \"the preliminary injunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, \nthe fact that DAPA never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities.\"  (Mem. \nfrom John F. Kelly, Sec'y, DHS, Rescission of November 20,2014, Memorandum Providing for \nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Petmanent Residents (\"DAP A\") at 3 (June \n15, 2017) (Admin. R. 237).)  This memo left the original DACA program in place and did not \naffect the remaining tln·ee-year grants of deferred action that were issued under the DACA \nExpansion prior to Judge Hanen's issuance of a preliminary injunction in Texas.  (kl at 2 & n.3). \nFollowing the rescission of the 2014 DAP A Memo, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, \njoined by the attorneys-general often other states, wrote to Attorney General Jefferson B. \nSessions to insist that the Executive Branch rescind the 2012 DACA Memo.  (Ltr. fi·om Ken \nPaxton, Att'y Gen. ofTe x., to Hon. Jeff Sessions, Att'y Gen. ofthe U.S. (June 29, 2017) \n(Admin. R. 238).)  Paxton threatened that ifDHS did not stop issuing or renewing deferred \naction and work authorization under DACA or the DACA Expansion, the plaintiff states would \namend their complaint in the Texas litigation \"to challenge both the DACA program and the \nremaining Expanded DACA permits.\"  Mat 2.)  If, however, Defendants agreed to rescind the \n2012 DACA Memo and to cease \"renew[ing] or issu[ing] any new DACA or Expanded DACA \npermits in the future,\" the plaintiffs would voluntarily dismiss their complaint.  (Id.) \nOn September 5, 2017, Defendants announced that the DACA program would be brought \nto a gradual end.  In an undated letter (the \"Sessions Letter\"), the Attorney General wrote to \nthen-Acting DHS Secretary Elaine C. Duke to \"advise that [DHS] should rescind\" the 2012 \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 17 of 55 PageID #: 7312\nDACA Memo.5  (Sessions Ltr.)  The Attorney General opined that DACA was unlawful, \nunconstitutional, and likely to be invalidated in court: \nDACA was  effectuated  by the  previous  administration  through \nexecutive action, without proper statutory authority and with no \nestablished end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed \nlegislation that would have accomplished a similar result.  Such an \nopen-ended  circumvention  of  immigration  laws  was  an \nunconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.  The \nrelated  Deferred  Action  for  Parents  of Americans  and  Lawful \nPermanent Residents (DAPA) policy was enjoined on a nationwide \nbasis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circnit on the basis of \nmultiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally \ndivided vote.  Then Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly \nrescinded the DAP A policy in June.  Because the DACA policy has \nthe same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized \nas to DAP A, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would \nyield similar results with respect to DACA. \n(Id . (citation omitted).) \nThereafter, Acting Secretary Duke issued a memorandum (the \"DACA Rescission \nMemo\") instmcting her subordinates to \"execute a wind-down ofthe program.\"  (DACA \nRescission Memo at 1.)  Acting Secretary Duke briefly summarized the creation of the DACA \nand DAP A programs and stated that, although the DACA program \"purported to use deferred \naction-an act of prosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-\ncase basis,\" \"USCIS has not been able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant \nappeared to satisfy the programmatic categorical criteria as outlined in the [2012 DACA Memo] \nbut still had his or her application denied based solely upon discretion.\"  (Id. at 2 & n.l.)  Acting \nSecretary Duke then described the history of the Texas litigation, noting that the Fifth Circuit had \naffirmed the injunction against the implementation of the DAP A program based on the finding \n5  While the Sessions Letter is not dated, the bookmarks in the electronic PDF file of the Administrative Record \nascribe a date of September 4, 2017, to this letter. \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 18 of 55 PageID #: 7313\n\"that DACA decisions were not truly discretionary,\" and observed that Secretary Kelly had acted \nto end categorical or class-based exemptions of aliens from potential enforcement of the \nimmigration laws and to rescind the DAPA program while leaving the DACA program \n\"temporarily ... in place.\"  iliL at 2; see id. at 2-3.) \nThe Acting Secretary then noted that Texas and several other states had threatened to \nchallenge the DACA program, and she briefly summarized the Attorney General's opinion that \nDACA was unconstitutional, unlawful, and likely to be stluck down because it shared \"the same \nlegal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA  .\"  iliL at 3 (quoting \nSessions Ltr.).)  \"Taking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's mlings in \nthe ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017letter from the Attorney General,\" she \nconcluded, \"it is clear that the June 15,2012, DACA program should be terminated.\"  iliL at 4.) \nIn light of \"the complexities associated with winding down the program,\" however, \nActing Secretary Duke directed that the program should be wound down gradually.  (Id.)  Initial \napplications, renewal requests, and associated applications for work authorization that had been \n\"accepted\" by DHS by September 5, 2017, would be adjudicated \"on an individual, case-by-case \nbasis.\"  ilil)  Likewise, all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for work \nauthorization submitted by \"current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September \n5, 2017] and March 5, 2018,\" would be adjudicated, provided that these requests were \"accepted \nby [DHS] as of October 5, 2017.\"  ilil) DHS would, however, \"reject all DACA initial requests \nand associated applications for [work authorization] filed after the date of this memorandum\" \nand \"all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for [work authorization] filed \noutside ofthe[se] parameters.\"  ilil)  Existing DACA benefits would not be terminated \n18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 19 of 55 PageID #: 7314\nimmediately but would not be renewed, and DHS would no longer approve further applications \nfor advance parole.\"  @.) \nE.  Procedural History \nThe court will not restate the procedural history of these cases prior to November 2017, \nwhich is set forth in the comt's November 9 Memorandum and Order.  The court will, however, \nprovide the following timeline of recent developments in these cases. \nOn December 11,2017, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint \n(Dkt. 113), which largely tracked their Second Amended Complaint but added a claim that \nDefendants Nielsen and Sessions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by \nrejecting DACA renewal applications that (l) were promptly mailed but received by USCIS after \nOctober 5, 2017, due to U.S. Postal Service delays; (2) were delivered to USCIS by October 5, \n2017, but rejected because they arrived too late in the day; or (3) contained \"minor perceived or \nactual clerical enors.\"  (Third Am. Compl. (Dkt. 113) ~ 203; see id. ~~ 199-205.) \nOn December 20, 2017, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the U.S. Comt of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit denying Defendants' petition for a writ of mandamus to the \nNorthem District of Califomia in similar litigation challenging Defendants' decision to end the \nDACA program.  In reUnited States, No. 17-801 (U.S. Dec. 20, 2017) (per curiam).  The \nSupreme Court held that the \"Govermnent [has made] serious argmnents that at least pottions of \nthe District Court's order are overly broad\" and that, \"[u]nder the specific facts of [that] case,\" \nthe district court should have resolved the Govermnent' s arguments that the decision to rescind \nthe DACA program was not subject to judicial review before ordering the Govemment to \nproduce a complete administrative record.  Id. (slip op. at 3).  The Court suggested that the \ndistrict court \"may consider cettifying that ruling for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(b) if appropriate.\"  Id. (slip op. at 4). \n19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 20 of 55 PageID #: 7315\nOne week later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Defendants' \npetition for a writ of mandamus to this court and lifted its stay of record-related orders entered by \nthis court and by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein.  (Dec. 27,2017, USCA Order (Dkt. 210).) \nThe Second Circuit rejected Defendants' position that they could unilaterally determine which \nportions of the administrative record the court could consider, and determined that, in light of the \n\"strong suggestion that the record before the [District Court] was not complete,\" plaintiffs were \nentitled to discovery as to whether Defendants had produced a full administrative record.  ([d, at \n2 (quoting Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644, 654 (2d Cir. 1982)) (alteration in original).) \nRejecting Defendants' contention that compliance with this court's and Judge Orenstein's \nrecord-related orders would burden the Executive Branch, the Second Circuit noted that this \ncourt had repeatedly limited the scope of those orders, such that, as the Government conceded, \n\"the number of documents, covered by the order, as modified, is approximately 20,000, a far \nsmaller number than the Government's papers led this court to believe.\"  (Id. at 3-4.)  The \nSecond Circuit distinguished In re United States on the grounds that this court had already \nconsidered and rejected Defendants' jurisdictional arguments, clarified that the orders in question \ndid not apply to White House documents, and limited the orders to apply to dramatically fewer \ndocuments than were at issue in the cases before the Northern District of California.  ([d, at 4-5.) \nDefendants then moved for the court to certify its November 9 Memorandum and Order \nfor interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  (Mot. to Cettify Order for Appeal \n(Dkt. 219).)  They argued that certification would \"materially advance the disposition of the \nlitigation\" by either \"terminat[ing] the litigation\" or \"clarify[ing] the rights of the parties\" and \n\"limiting the claims going forward in this litigation.\"  (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Certify Order \nfor Appeal (Dkt. 219-1) at 14.)  On January 8, 2018, the court granted Defendants' motion to \n20 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 21 of 55 PageID #: 7316\ncertify the November 9 Memorandum and Order for interlocutory appeal because, among other \nthings, there was \"substantial ground for difference of opinion\" on the question of whether the \nDACA rescission was committed to agency discretion by law.  (Jan. 8, 2018, Mem. & Order \n(Dkt. 233) at 4-6.)  Defendants then argued that the court should delay an oral argument \nscheduled for January 18, 2018, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the interlocutory \nappeal, as \"all (or at least most) of [the] district-court proceedings [regarding Defendants' \nmotions to dismiss, PlaintiffS' motions for a preliminary injunction, and the Batalla Vidal \nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification] will be uunecessary if the Second Circuit accepts some \nor all of the government's arguments on jurisdiction and justiciability.\"  (Defs. Jan. 11,2018, \nLtr. (Dkt. 236) at 1.)  Before the Second Circuit, however, Defendants abruptly changed tack, \nagreeing with Plaintiffs \"that holding the petition [for interlocutory appeal] in abeyance would be \nthe most efficient course of action,\" pending this court's consideration of Defendants' motion to \ndismiss and Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary relief and class certification.  (Reply in Supp. of \nPet. for Permission to Appeal (Dkt. 28, Nielsen v. Vidal, No. 18-122 (2d Cir.)) at 2.)6 \nOn January 9, 2018, the Northern District of California denied Defendants' motion to \ndismiss Regents and its companion cases and granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. \n(Nov. 9, 2018, Order Denying FRCP 12(b)(l) Dismissal and Granting Provisional Relief(Dkt. \n234, Regents).)  Like this court, Judge William Alsup rejected Defendants' contentions that the \ndecision to end the DACA program was committed to agency discretion by law and that 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) barred judicial review of that decision.  (I d. at 18-23.)

(Id. at \n29; see id. at 29-38.)  Judge Alsup rejected Defendants' argument that \"DHS acted within its \ndiscretion in managing its litigation exposure in the Fifth Circuit, weighing its options, and \ndeciding on an orderly wind down of the program so as to avoid a potentially disastrous \ninjunction in the Fifth Circuit\" as a \"classic post hoc rationalization\" and, in any event, \ninsufficient to support the decision to rescind the DACA program because Defendants had \nneither considered defenses to Texas's potentially imminent suit nor weighed supposed litigation \nrisks against \"DACA's programmatic objectives as well as the reliance interests ofDACA \nrecipients.\" (Id. at 38-43.) \nII.  LEGALSTANDARD \n\"[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\"  Mazurek v. \nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam) (quoting l1A Charles A. Wright eta!., \nFederal Practice and Procedure§ 2948, at 130 (2d ed. 1995)) (emphasis omitted).  A party \n\"seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits; that he \nis likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor; and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"  Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)7  To establish a likelihood of success on the merits, the \n7  The Second Circuit has, at times, formulated this standard differently.  For example, a party seeking a preliminary \ninjunction may demonstrate the existence of\"a serious question going to the merits to make them a fair ground for \ntrial, with a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in [its] favor,\" rather than a likelihood of success on the merits. \nCitigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Oppmtunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2010); see \n22 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 23 of 55 PageID #: 7318\nparty seeking an injunction \"need only make a showing that the probability of his prevailing is \nbetter than fifty percent.\"  Eng v. Smith, 849 F.2d 80, 82 (2d Cir. 1988); see also Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418,434 (2009) (\"It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be 'better \nthan negligible.'\" (quoting Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d 703,707 (7th Cir. 1999))).  When an \ninjunction is \"mandatory,\" however-that is, when the injunction \"alter[s] the status quo by \ncommanding some positive act\"-the movant must demonstrate a \"clear\" or \"substantial\" \nshowing oflikelihood of success.  Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm't, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, \n34 (2d Cir. 1995).  To obtain a mandatory injunction, a movant must also \"make a strong \nshowing of irreparable harm.\"  State of New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 \nF.3d 638,650 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nFor the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are entitled to a \npreliminary injunction against implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nFirst, Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits oftheir claim that \nDefendants' decision to end the DACA program was substantively arbitrary and capricious.8 \nalso id. at 35-38 (holding that this \"serious questions\" standard survives Winter and other Supreme Court cases \napplying a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" standard).  The Second Circuit's \"serious questions\" standard does \nnot apply, however, \"[w]hen ... a preliminary injunction will affect government action taken in the public interest \npursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme.\" Friends of the East Hampton Airport, Inc. v. Town of East Hampton, \n841 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The court need not decide whether \nthe more permissive \"serious questions\" standard applies here, as Plaintiffs concede that the \"likelihood of success\" \nstandard applies here and have met this standard.  See generally Haitian Ctt·s. Council, Inc. v. McNary, 969 F.2d \n1326,1338-39 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"serious questions\" standard applies when challenged governmental action is not \nspecifically authorized by statute or regulation), cert. granted and judgment vacated as moot, Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. \nCouncil, Inc., 509 U.S. 918 (1993). \n8  The court need not decide whether the injunction sought by Plaintiffs is \"mandatory,\" in that it would compel \nDefendants to take affirmative acts to adjudicate DACA applications and renewal requests, or non-mandatory, in \nthat it would only preserve the status quo as of September 4, 2017.  Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \"clear\" \nor \"substantial\" likelihood of success on the merits, they are entitled to a preliminary injunction regardless of the \nstandard that applies. \n23 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 24 of 55 PageID #: 7319\nPlaintiffs contend that this decision violated AP A § 706(2)(A) because, among other things, it \nwas based on an erroneous legal conclusion that DACA was unlawful, failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the problem, and was internally contradictory.  (BV Pls. Mot. at 11-20,23-\n27; State Pls. Mot. at 5-13.)  Defendants aver, however, that the decision reflects a reasonable \nassessment oflitigation risk.  (Defs. Opp'n at 1, 10-13, 15-24.)  Based on the record before it, the \ncourt concludes that Plaintiffs, not Defendants, are substantially likely to be correct. \n1.  The Stated Rationale for Rescinding DACA Appears To Be Arbitrary and \nCapricious \nPlaintiffs have identified at least three respects in which Defendants' decision to rescind \nthe DACA program appears to be arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.  First, the \ndecision rests on the erroneous legal conclusion that the DACA program is unlawful and \nunconstitutional.  Second, the decision rests on the enoneous factual premise that courts have \ndetermined that the DACA program violates the Constitution.  Third, the stated rationale for that \ndecision is internally contradictory, as Defendants have continued to grant DACA renewal \nrequests despite ending the DACA program on the grounds that it is, by their lights, \nunconstitutional.  The court addresses each ofthese reasons in turn. \na.  The Decision Relies on the Legally Erroneous Premise that DACA \nIs Illegal \nAn agency decision that is based on an erroneous legal premise cannot withstand \narbitrary-and-capricious review.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  It is well-established that when \n\"[agency] action is based upon a determination oflaw as to which the reviewing authority of the \ncourts does come into play, an order may not stand ifthe agency has misconceived the law.\" \nChenery I, 318 U.S. at 94.  Accordingly, numerous courts have recognized that agency action \nbased on a misconception of the applicable law is arbitrary and capricious in substance.  See, \nM,., Yale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F.3d 71, 86-87 (2d Cir. 2006); Transitional Hosps. \n24 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 25 of 55 PageID #: 7320\nCorp. of La., Inc. v. Shalal~ 222 F.3d 1019, 1029 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (Garland, J.); see also \nPlanned Parenthood Fed. of Am., Inc. v. Heckler, 712 F.2d 650,666 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Bork, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"If a regulation is based on an incorrect view of \napplicable law, the regulation cannot stand as promulgated ....\" (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted)).  That is no less true when an agency takes some action based on an erroneous \nview that the action is compelled by law, notwithstanding that the agency could have taken the \nsame action on policy grounds.  \"An agency action, however permissible as an exercise of \ndiscretion, cannot be sustained 'where it is based not on the agency's own judgment but on an \nerroneous view of the law.\"'  Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Dep't ofTransp., 137 F.3d 640, 646 (D.C. \nCir. 1998) (quoting Prill v. NLRB, 755 F.2d 941, 947 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  This rule is consistent \nwith cases from outside the administrative-law context, which make clear that a decision based \non \"an erroneous view of the law\" is \"by definition\" or \"necessarily\" an abuse of discretion. \nKoon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 100 (1996); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Com., 496 U.S. 384, \n405 (1990).  This rule also ensures that agencies are accountable for their decisions:  If an agency \nmakes a decision on policy grounds, it must say so, not act as if courts have tied its hands.  The \ncourt therefore considers whether Defendants' decision to rescind the DACA program relied on \n25 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 26 of 55 PageID #: 7321\nan erroneous view of the law.  This review is de novo.  5 U.S.C. § 706; J. Andrew Lange, Inc. v. \nFAA, 208 F.3d 389, 391 (2d Cir. 2000).9 \nFairly read, the Sessions Letter and DACA Rescission Memo indicate only that \nDefendants decided to end the DACA program because they believed that it was illegal.  (While \nDefendants now argue that the decision was based on \"litigation risk,\" the record does not \nsupp01t this contention, as the court explains below.)  The DACA Rescission Memo offers no \nindependent legal reasoning as to why Defendants believed the DACA program to be unlawful, \nso the court turns to the Sessions Letter.  In that letter, the Attorney General offered two \ndiscernible bases for his opinion that the DACA program violated the law and should end: first, \nthat it was unconstitutional, and second, that it \"has the same legal and constitutional defects that \nthe courts recognized as to DAPA  .\"  (Sessions Ltr.)  Neither conclusion is sustainable. \n9daTMlUcDbBd areoheeWgw.eafoSneateubfre,s.nterh\"eeb  rien i4 idosmiistnltdtm1  hvetectifa5, eehnnoe pin,y2rnae,rt l,t  34  t ed swCd goD82mt  otohtahi 4heht erFoeeh-nfeaeniv2d.e  otrr3ttrn5  n  hetrtdoic o hdednewno (tae6a  t1 ,ntIes an2c h9DNtUorrh2ter9prsnAAoa,x.a9'r S. rut6ne ) Cvsg.()gt2tAB,ite,a  Ahe7 hCdate.bw  ie,n  ncho( puwiIs 5aoernrtan u ti vot aagichtiosnrghcbl.e eo sfCtre onve oni at-nium.crh ma r pewtdy.Nenp  ir et '2tdhweslahlhfe0e- etteeeaiamc.gt0r n srhtoleaR1it  eeenmtoelu)enghirrc.nnts  atempyetsi.cl h Frn.  ioSeo eoDatginnyetnUtff ea sst t atp wfo thtnshml.iiri leofitehooyCtu  lnt eingA,ehDtco  disrmoiePhouaA t  SLf n nADmaaaC taackelr,aA m lie tAicstl,ttn e ,tCehooe  tagsprhenInsAt   nriuvtsnaatr oc it.trtog p tie.g evltM,rdor   euri oinee4teadttehgtsoe6w m eiae trdst7worsd  a   m eDi c ma UisadnCth  iAb\"het.e naotSisfoonuCatreum.luutgtr erAbiint8tee.tod  s,l 3wnd s n etnRt7a5ca d owhoy,3edne   et,3tisiotd8  onttico eseh4vh Uginesff2ese  eo ela.tsr- nySr rrd 4ihtIe omuo.mha3No ntln~2 ea encSi(w   1ln\"Me 1Dt  wo 8i.aov9u s Aer,.hr8tnt 2rSm eheA4Cacd2erten)ooeihge6A ,ntn r e eu- cD gS Ctxr2tiparhr  hteo7mhtnrreehefoel· en eyll(aag-Avli2tn Ayt nr tr O0dDPah poggb0am eArfn euedn1of f . \" isde)t egsershf.fehrn rnBo eoefahodtrre,reimaueac etrc5vlnnele  aed2Iewc ntnudos 6 echnac s f. tea s.eo o . v  vt  e.  \nDjSteCDatdbuohronaee sorAeRm ycftensriea dCeefeseen-i stv  xAbscdiaacit-apyrcaeiu'cngts,lanwta ia duidoatCnnoesm mencDadn'am -eten  odrAosulneicnelurcnaCtsecgyps dctlicA   iplsibeobooanior,utentom dh rifrtL-not-ehodimeda nsrerted w-aoe e tnIw och nh sf tearwiarth indnsaW ori(i gitdsenatdno hsr  rgcet(aro,g hJ  scorrn(ufa eeyiuagahins s rrniD,aia.plg ~ ogvirTeAu1 nnb,eac a6ig ib Crnttkto,  ogr agtteAf2aoo usf  rr0te e iC eyhpicn1drtc-aaoresg8 oaoro tdn ,e rnmg in\" sen 8dir[ Bivmnsaaid:-]et0tclnmeeneeora0 rasrns\".gp Ae adohad rsl( Sofdi M ttJeacmhwimeanrniae)no  udgi,at,t.tu , hs is t heanst e1ei. tD rgfdg 2btsgA pt .l,etAt ,uhyas  h2tmmJ e:nCte0c/ooid/ e1hAirwsmDna n8ahd riwtArew)m desBi,ytwc   Cahaaoal isGal.sbstAf l\"tci lsa pAeto)e kiowp.nsnm\" mP :re  fw/oDrAipa/rasegtahlr nea ayeirl§yfk,nd'a b se  aeUdm7icl nnncoieo0ndn)ag geu6e;dadr d .xr(oenZcee2t ebosrtsfpa)srs lu m(etccso thAbtnhahigh/esjnduao).ee e.crdenSu mc yonoidlet(n dm stesDPft g eosrd rer/el sieb iunSvojftcvultasfeneeoyio.dnsss,e g  r idtsO wWhc/coLiiweoian p eaddhmvnhgptleteyesy -'eerffn  s'-erensEene e,v nrao tsnJnte itdtsdhu jejn io 1opiwastotsih0tiitrnnci,na ee- fRrisli1si ienlnstcsey1t g geasig. o )dth ei n oon,unt sl  d \n26 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 27 of 55 PageID #: 7322\ni.  The Attorney General Erred in Concluding that DACA Is \nUnconstitutional \nAs noted above, the Attorney General concluded that DACA was unconstitutional \nbecause it \"was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without \nproper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result\" and \"an open-ended \ncircumvention of inunigration laws.\"  (Sessions Ltr.)  This conclusory statement does not \nsupport the proposition that DACA is unconstitutional. \nDACA is not unconstitutional simply because it was implemented by unilateral, \nexecutive action without express congressional authorization.  The Executive Branch has wide \ndiscretion not to initiate or pursue specific enforcement actions.  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831-32. \nInunigration officials have particularly \"broad discretion\" in deciding whom to deport, deriving \nboth from the considerations specific to the Executive Branch in the foreign-policy arena, \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 396, and from the fact that far more removable aliens reside in this country \nthan DHS has resources to deport, OLC Op. at 1; see also Adam B. Cox & Cristina M. \nRodriguez, The President and Immigration Law, 119 Yale L.J. 458,510-19 (2009).  Every \nmodem presidential administration has relied on extra-statutory discretionary-relief programs to \nshield certain removable aliens from deportation.  Far from cabining this authority, Congress has \namended the INA in ways that expressly acknowledge the Executive Branch's power to decline \nto initiate removal proceedings against certain removable aliens.  It thus cannot be the case that, \nby recognizing that certain removable aliens represented lower enforcement priorities than \nothers, the DACA program violates the Constitution. \nNor is DACA unconstitutional because it identified a certain category of removable \naliens-individuals who were brought to the United States as children, lacked meaningful \n27 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 28 of 55 PageID #: 7323\ncriminal histories, and had met educational or military-service requirements-as eligible for \nfavorable treatment.  The comt is aware of no principled reason why the Executive Branch may \ngrant deferred action to particular immigrants but may not create a program by which individual \nimmigrants who meet certain prescribed criteria are eligible to request deferred action.  It is \nsurely within DHS's discretion to determine that certain categories of removable alien-felons \nand gang members, for example--are better uses of the agency's limited enforcement resources \nthan law-abiding individuals who entered the United States as children.  Indeed, unless deferred \naction decisions are to be entirely random, they necessarily must be based at least in part on \n\"categorical\" or \"class-based\" distinctions.  See Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 \n(D.D.C. 2014) (DACA \"helps to ensure that the exercise of deferred action is not arbitrary and \ncapricious, as might be the case if the executive branch offered no guidance to enforcement \nofficials. It would make little sense for a Comt to strike down as arbitrary and capricious \nguidelines that help ensure that the Nation's immigration enforcement is not arbitrary but rather \nreflective of congressionally-directed priorities.\").  The coutt cannot see how the use of such \ndistinctions to define eligibility for a deferred-action program transforms such a program from \ndiscretionaty agency action into substantive lawmaking and (somehow) an encroachment on the \nseparation of powers. \nLastly, DACA is not unconstitutional because, as the Attorney General put it, that \nprogram was implemented \"after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would \nhave accomplished a similar result.\"  (Sessions Ltr.)  The \"proposed legislation\" to which the \nAttorney General referred would not have \"accomplished a similar result\" to DACA.  The \nDREAM Act, in its many variations, would have offered its beneficiaries a formal immigration \nstatus and a pathway to lawful pe1manent residency.  See, e.g., Development, Relief, and \n28 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 29 of 55 PageID #: 7324\nEducation for Alien Minors Act of2011, S. 952 (112th Cong.); Regents, 2018 WL 339144, at 20 \nn.l5 (collecting proposed legislation).  DACA, on the other hand, offers only forbearance from \ndeportation, along with work authorization, and does not provide an immigration status or a \npathway to citizenship.  (2012 DACA Memo at 4.) \nEven if the DREAM Act had offered benefits similar to those conveyed by DACA, it \ndoes not follow that Congress's failure to enact a DREAM Act precluded the Executive Branch \nfrom enacting the DACA program.  The court does not see how executive action, taken either \n\"pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress\" or \"in the absence of either a \ncongressional grant or denial of authority,\" becomes unconstitutional simply because Congress \nhas considered and failed to enact legislation that would accomplish similar ends.  See \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-37 (1952) (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  Fruitless congressional consideration of legislation is not itself law, see U.S. Const. \nart. I,§ 7, cl. 2, and is an unconvincing basis for ascertaining the \"implied will of Congress\" to \noust the President from acting in the space contemplated by the proposed but un-enacted \nlegislation, see Youngstown Sheet & Tube, 343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  It strikes \nthe court as improbable that, if the President has some authority, any Member of Congress can \ndivest the President of that authority by introducing unsuccessful legislation on the same subject. \nTo the extent the decision to end the DACA program was based on the Attorney \nGeneral's determination that the program is unconstitutional, that detennination was legally \nerroneous, and the decision was therefore arbitrary and capricious.  The court does not address \nwhether the DACA program might be unconstitutional on grounds other than those identified by \nthe Attorney General, as any such grounds are not fairly before the court. \n29 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 30 of 55 PageID #: 7325\nii.  The Attomey General Erred in Concluding that DACA Has the \n\"Same Legal and Constitutional Defects that the Courts \nRecognized as to D AP A\" \nNor can the Attomey General's determination that DACA is unlawful rest on the ground \nthat \"the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as \nto DAP A.\"  (Sessions Ltr.)  That rationale is arbitrary and capricious not only because it is \npremised on an obvious factual mistake that courts had recognized \"constitutional defects\" in \nDAP A, as the court explains in the next subsection, but also because it is legally erroneous.  The \nSouthern District of Texas enjoined the implementation of the DAPAprogram on the grounds \nthat DAP A was not promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking, and the Fifth Circuit \naffirmed, adding the additional ground for affirmance that DAP A was substantively arbitrary and \ncapricious because it conflicted with the INA.  The court is unpersuaded that either ground \napplies to DACA. \n(I)  DACA Was Not a Legislative Rule. \nDACA does not appear to have been a \"legislative\" rule that was subject to notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  The APA generally requires agencies to make \"rules\" through notice-and-\ncomment procedures, but provides an exception for \"interpretative mles, general statements of \npolicy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\"  5 U.S.C. § 553.  The line \nbetween legislative rules (which are subject to notice and comment) and non-legislative rules \n(which are not) is not always clear.  See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281,301-03 (1979); \nNoel v. Chapman, 508 F.2d 1013, 1029-30 (2d Cir. 1975) (characterizing this distinction as \n\"enshrouded in considerable smog\").  In general, however, \"legislative rules are those that \n'create new law, rights, or duties, in what amounts to a legislative act.'\"  Sweet v. Sheahan, 235 \nF.3d 80, 91 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 303 (2d Cir. 1993)).  A rule is \n30 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 31 of 55 PageID #: 7326\nlegislative if it creates a \"binding norm.\"  Bellamo Int'l Ltd. v. FDA, 678 F. Supp. 410, 412 \n(E.D.N.Y. 1988) (quoting Am. Bus Ass'n v. United States, 627 F.2d 525, 529 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). \nGeneral statements of policy, on the other hand, do not \"change 'existing rights and obligations'\" \nof those regulated, but instead state the agency's \"general policy\" or \"are rules directed primarily \nat the staff of an agency describing how it will conduct agency discretionary functions.\"  Noel, \n508 F.2d at 1030 (quoting Lewis-Mota v. Sec 'y of Labor, 469 F.2d 4 78, 482 (2d Cir. 1972)) \n(internal quotation marks and additional citation omitted); see also Chrysler, 441 U.S. at 302 \nn.31 (\"General statements of policy are statements issued by an agency to advise the public \nprospectively ofthe manner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.\" \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \nOn its face, the 2012 DACA Memo is plainly a \"general statement of policy,\" not a \nsubstantive rule.  That memo described how, as a matter of agency policy, DHS would exercise \nits prosecutorial discretion with respect to a discrete class of individuals without lawful \nimmigration status, and directed DHS staff to implement procedures to facilitate that exercise of \ndiscretion.  Most importantly, the memo stated that it created no substantive right, that all DACA \napplications would be adjudicated on an individualized basis, and that the agency retained \ndiscretion to deny or revoke deferred action or work authorization.  Based on the text of the 2012 \nDACA Memo, the court cannot say that the creation of the DACA program either \"imposed any \nrights and obligations\" on DHS or the public, or did not \"genuinely [leave] the agency and its \ndecisionmakers free to exercise discretion.\"  Clarian Health W., LLC v. Hargan, 878 F.3d 346, \n357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nTo determine whether a rule is properly classed as \"legislative\" or as a \"general statement \nof policy,\" some courts have also considered whether the agency has characterized or treated the \n31 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 32 of 55 PageID #: 7327\nrule as binding.  Id.  In determining that the DAP A program constituted a legislative rule, the \nSouthem District of Texas focused on the purportedly binding effect that DAPA would have on \nthe agency.  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 668-72.  Judge Hanen reached that conclusion by \ndetermining that DACA had been implemented in such a way as to deprive agency employees of \ntrue discretion to evaluate DACA applications on a case-by-case basis, including that (l) the \n\"operating procedures\" for implementing DACA were quite long; (2) DACA applications were \nadjudicated by service-center staff, not field-office employees, using a check-the-box form; (3) \ncertain DACA denials were subject to review by a supervisor; (4) \"there is no option for granting \nDAPA to an individual who does not meet each criterion\"; and (5) nearly all DACA applications \nwere granted, and those that were denied were uniformly denied for mechanical reasons or fraud. \nId. at 669 & nn.98-l01. \nThe comt respectfully finds the Southem District of Texas's analysis unpersuasive.  First, \nusers \nthat court appears to have conflated the discretion of the agency with that of individual \nemployees.  (See Br. for the United States at 68-71, Texas v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2271 \n(2016) (No. 15-674).)  The 2012 DACA Memo indicated how DHS would exercise its discretion \nby treating certain individuals as lower priorities for removal.  Because the 2012 DACA Memo \ncreated no substantive rights, it in no way constrained the agency's discretion in the enforcement \nof immigration laws, even if it might have affected how rank-and-file users employees \nreviewed specific requests for deferred action.  (See id.)  Second, even accepting that the relevant \nfocus of this inquiry is the discretion of rank-and-file employees, the comt views the first four \nfactors on which the Southem District of Texas relied as insufficient to support an inference that \nDHS did not exercise discretion in adjudicating DACA applications.  As for the fifth factor-that \nDHS supposedly granted too many DACA applications-the court finds persuasive the \n32 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 33 of 55 PageID #: 7328\nobservation by the dissenting judge in the Fifth Circuit that the district court appears to have \nerroneously conflated rejections ofDACA applications, which were made on intake for \nmechanical reasons, and denials, which were made \"when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by \ncase basis, determines that the requestor has not demonstrated that they satisfy the guidelines for \nDACA or when an adjudicator determines that deferred action should be denied even though the \nthreshold guidelines are met.\" Texas, 809 F.3d at 210 (King, J., dissenting).  To the contrary, as \nof December 2014, DHS had denied nearly 40,000 DACA applications out of the more than \n700,000 applications accepted for processing at USCIS service centers, and rejected more than \n40,000 applications for administrative reasons.  Id. at 210 n.44.  This rejection rate hardly \n\"suggests an agency on autopilot\" and is \"unsurprising given the self-selecting nature of the \nprogram.\"  Id. at 210 & n.44; see also Arpaio, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 209 n.l3 (noting that similar \nstatistics \"reflect that ... case-by-case review is in operation\").  To the extent Defendants rely on \nTexas for the proposition that the DACA program (which was not challenged in that litigation) \nwas illegal because it was not made through notice-and-comment mlemaking, such reliance is \narbitrary and capricious. \n(II) DACA Does Not Conflict with the INA \nNor may Defendants rely on Texas for the proposition that the DACA program conflicts \nwith the INA.  As noted above, the Fifth Circuit held that the DAP A program was not only \nprocedurally invalid, but also substantively arbitrary and capricious because it conflicted with the \nINA.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 178-86.  That is because, in the view ofthe Fifth Circuit, the INA \nprescribes the exclusive means by which aliens may obtain \"lawful immigration classification \nfrom their children's immigration status,\" and because Congress could not have intended to \ndelegate to DHS the authority to designate approximately four million undocumented \n33 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 34 of 55 PageID #: 7329\nimmigrants as lawfully present and able to work in this country.  See id.  To the extent \nDefendants relied, without additional explanation, on this decision as grounds for ending the \nDACA program, they acted arbitrarily and capriciously, for two reasons. \nFirst, not all the grounds on which the Fifth Circuit decided that DAP A was substantively \narbitrary and capricious apply to the DACA program.  For example, the Fifth Circuit inferred \nthat by creating procedures by which alien parents of U.S. citizens may obtain lawful status, \nCongress implicitly prohibited the Executive Branch from granting deferred action and work \nauthorization to such individuals based on more permissive criteria.  Even if the court were to \naccept that dubious logic, it would not apply to DACA, because there is no analogous procedure \nby which aliens brought to the United States as children may seek to obtain lawful status on that \nbasis.  (BV Pls. Mot. at 25; Br. of Amicus Curiae Legal Services Organizations (Dkt. 193) at 6.) \nThe Fifth Circuit also relied extensively on the magnitude of the DAP A program, reasoning that \nCongress could not have intended the Executive Branch to decide whether more than four \nmillion undocumented immigrants could obtain defell'ed action and work authorization.  Texas, \n809 F.3d at 179, 181-82, 184 & n.197.  Again, even accepting that proposition, it is not clear \nwhy it would apply to the DACA program, which is open to far fewer individuals than DAPA   \nwould have been, and which is roughly the same scale as the Family Fairness program enacted \nby the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations in the 1980s. \nSecond, to the extent that the Fifth Circuit's rationale applies to the DACA program, the \ncourt finds it unpersuasive.  It does not follow that by prescribing procedures by which some \naliens may obtain lawful status, Congress implicitly barred the Executive Branch from granting \nthose or other aliens deferred action and work authorization, a relatively meager and unstable set \nof benefits (if, indeed, they can even be described as such).  Nor is the court convinced that by \n34 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 35 of 55 PageID #: 7330\nexpressly recognizing that certain discrete populations of aliens are eligible for defened action, \nCongress implicitly precluded the Executive Branch from according defen·ed action to other \naliens; to the contrary, the court views these enactments as ratifying the Executive Branch's \nlongstanding historical practice, rooted in the INA, of forbearing from pursuing deportation \nproceedings against particular aliens and categories of alien.  The court respectfully finds the \nFifth Circuit's attempts to distinguish DAP A from prior discretionary-relief programs \nunpersuasive, as this coutt does not see what in the INA permits immigration officials to accord \ndiscretionary relief\"on a country-specific basis,\" as a \"bridge[] from one legal status to another,\" \nor as an adjunct to \"a statutory legalization scheme,\" id. at 184, but not to generally law-abiding \nparents of U.S. citizens or lawful petmanent residents--or, for that matter, individuals who were \nbrought to the United States as children. \nFor these reasons, and for the reasons stated by the Office of Legal Counsel, the dissent \nin Texas, and by the Office of the Solicitor General in its brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in \nTexas, the court concludes that DACA is lawful and not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the \nINA.  See Texas, 809 F.3d at 214-18 (King, J., dissenting); OLC Op.; Br. for the United States at \n61-65, Texas v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (No. 15-674).  Defendants acted arbitrarily \nand capriciously by ending the DACA program based on the enoneous legal conclusion that \nDACA is either unconstitutional or \"has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts \nrecognized as to DAP A.\" \nb.  The Decision Relies on a Factually Erroneous Premise that Courts \nHave Determined that DACA Is Unconstitutional \nThis conclusion was also arbitrary and capricious because it is based on an obvious \nfactual mistake.  In concluding that the Southem District of Texas and Fifth Circuit would enjoin \nthe continued operation of the DACA program, Defendants appear to have relied on the premise \n35 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 36 of 55 PageID #: 7331\nthat those comts have recognized \"constitutional defects ... as to DAP A.\"  (Sessions Ltr.; \nD ACA Rescission Memo at 3.)  This premise is flatly incorrect.  The Southem District of Texas \nenjoined the implementation of DAP A, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed that injunction, on the \ngrounds that DAP A violated the AP A.  809 F .3d at 170-86; 86 F. Supp. 3d at 665-72.  Both \ncourts expressly declined to reach the plaintiffs' constitutional claim that DAP A violated the \nTake Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, see U.S. Const. art. II,§ 3, or the separation of \npowers.  809 F.3d at 154; 86 F. Supp. 3d at 677.  Defendants do not attempt to defend this \nfactual premise as correct.  (Cf. Defs. Opp'n at 26-27.) \nThis error alone is grounds for setting aside Defendants' decision.  \"[A]n agency decision \nis arbitrary and must be set aside when it rests on a cmcial factual premise shown by the \nagency's records to be indisputably incorrect.\"  Mizerak v. Adams, 682 F.2d 374, 376 (2d Cir. \n1982); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously by \"offer[ing] \nan explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency\"); City of \nKansas City, Mo. v. Dep't ofHous. & Urban Dev., 923 F.2d 188, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\"Agency \naction based on a factual premise that is flatly contradicted by the agency's own record does not \nconstitute reasoned administrative decisionmaking, and cannot survive review under the arbitrary \nand capricious standard.\").  Because neither the Southem District of Texas nor the Fifth Circuit \n\"recognized\" any \"constitutional defects\" in the DAPA policy, Defendants' reliance on this \nerroneous factual premise was arbitrary and capricious. \nNor was this error harmless.  Although judicial review under the APA takes \"due account \n... of the rule of prejudicial error,\" 5 U.S. C. § 706, \"the standard for demonstrating lack of \nprejudicial error is strict.  'Agency mistakes constitute harmless error [under AP A § 706] only \nwhere they clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached.\"' \n36 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 37 of 55 PageID #: 7332\nN.Y. Pub. Interest Research Gm. v. Whitman, 321 F.3d 316,334 n.l3 (2d Cir. 2003) (alteration \nin original) (quoting Sierra Club v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 245 F.3d 434,444 (5th Cir. \n2001)).  That cannot be said here, as the Attorney General's opinion that DACA was unlawful \nappears to have been based in significant part on his judgment that the program was \nunconstitutional and on the Texas courts' decision to enjoin implementation of DAP A.  The \ncurrent record furnishes no basis for this court to conclude that the Attorney General would have \nreached the same conclusion had he correctly understood the holdings of the Texas courts. \nc.  The Decision's Rationale Is Internally Contradictory \nFinally, Defendants' decision to rescind the DACA program was arbitrary and capricious \nbecause it appears to be internally inconsistent.  See, e.g., Nat'l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. \nNuclear Regulatory Conun'n,- F.3d -, 2018 WL 472547, at *9 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (\"Of course, \nit would be arbitrary and capricious for the agency's decision making to be 'internally \ninconsistent.\"' (citation omitted)); Gen. Chern. Corp. v. United States, 817 F.2d 844, 846 (D.C. \nCir. 1978) (per curiam) (vacating decision based on \"internally inconsistent and inadequately \nexplained\" analysis).  Defendants clearly ended the DACA program at least partly because the \nAttomey General viewed the program as unconstitutional.10  (Sessions Ltr.; DACA Rescission \nPA1TctTSd0llhrl eewdeaeeeeggIemcmas itia Atai rsJtiildp -elsnohitdaete trisoynote.nsrh icw o tcrtvHa ton it·BTen sa meti cidhslrtyaoialn   eco eM(ndcmG tSnakP-eir oadeepfmrw plennete ehtnataf eswv.iaansisr eodn ta5ie,su b ledl,teT-e  nihn ah2tlnereeaitla0uctx l dbwsy-1Aemp l n t7,esoroth optet, Futa arfos'o7omls tttrsde  h:r ne\"3dDsde ee\"Cd/o8i, .rAyg  )D  oe[\".

The means by which Defendants ended \nthe DACA program thus appear to conflict with their stated rationale for doing so.  If the DACA \nprogram was, in fact, unconstitutional, the court does not understand (nor have Defendants \nexplained) why Defendants would have the authority to continue to violate the Constitution, \nalbeit at a reduced scale and only for a limited time. \nIt is true but inunaterial that the DACA Rescission memo provided that DRS would \nadjudicate all remaining DACA applications and renewal requests \"on an individual, case-by-\ncase basis.\"  (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.)  The 2012 DACA Memo also stated that all DACA \napplications and renewal requests would be considered on an individual, case-by-case basis \n(2012 DACA Memo at 1-3), but, in Defendants' view, that was insufficient to render the \nprogram lawful.  More importantly, ifDHS could render the DACA program constitutional by \nadjudicating the remaining DACA applications and renewal requests on an \"individual, case-by-\ncase\" basis, then there was nothing inherently unconstitutional about the DACA program~nly \nhow rank-and-file USCIS employees were implementing that program-and a key reason for \nending that program would disappear. \nDefendants attempt to sidestep this problem by arguing that there was nothing inherently \ncontradictory about Acting Secretary Duke's decision to allow the DACA program \"to gradually \nsunset\" despite having \"concem[s] about [the program]'s legality.\"  (Defs. Opp'n at 30.)  The \njlul sDtifeifceantidoann ftso'r  atrhgeu [mdeecnitssi othna tto \" Prelsacinintidf ftsh eid DenAtiCfyA n porthoignrga mco]n\"t(r£ad[ iDcteofrsy.

(Sessions \nLtr.; DACA Rescission Memo at 3-4.)  Defendants' post hoc rationalization is thus unavailing. \nAt the very least, Defendants' failure to acknowledge and explain the apparent conflict between \ntheir determination that the DACA program was unconstitutional and their plan to continue \nadjudicating a subset ofDACA renewal requests renders their decision arbitrary and capricious. \n2.  Defendants' Alternative Grounds for Upholding the DACA Rescission \nAre Unpersuasive \nDefendants offer two reasons why the court should uphold the decision to end the DACA \nprogram.  First, they argue, that decision was reasonable in light of the risk that the plaintiffs in \nthe Texas litigation would amend their complaint to challenge the DACA program and that the \nSouthern District of Texas would strike down the DACA program.  (E.g., Defs. Opp'n at 11.) \nSecond, they argue that the court should construe the Attorney General's legal judgment that the \nDACA program was unlawful as an \"independent policy judgment ... that immigration \ndecisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.\"  (Defs. Opp'n at 25.) Neither argument \nis persuasive. \na.  The DACA Rescission Cannot Be Sustained on the Basis of \nDefendants' \"Litigation Risk\" Argument \nDefendants frame the decision to end the DACA program as motivated primarily by \n\"litigation risk.\"  (Id. at 1,10-13, 15-24.) In their view, Acting Secretary Duke considered the \nGovernment's losses in the Texas v. United States litigation and the threat by some ofthe \nplaintiffs in that litigation to challenge the DACA program and ultimately \"concluded that \nmaintaining the DACA [program] would, in all likelihood, result in another nationwide \ninjunction plunging the policy, and its nearly 800,000 recipients, into immediate uncertainty.\" \n39 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 40 of 55 PageID #: 7335\n(Id. at 11.)  That decision, they argue, was reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious, \"particularly in \nview of the near-certain litigation loss in the pending Texas lawsuit.\"  Q.d.) \nThe record does not suppmt Defendants' contention that they based their decision on a \nreasonable assessment of litigation risk.  As the court has previously noted, the record, fairly \nread, indicates that Defendants ended the DACA program because they believed it to be illegal. \nThe only basis for Defendants' \"litigation risk\" argument is the Attorney General's statement \nthat, because DACA shared the flaws of the DAPA program, \"it is likely that potentially \nimminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\"  (Sessions Ltr.)  This is \ntoo thin a reed to bear the weight of Defendants' \"litigation risk\" argument.  While the court \nmust uphold an agency decision \"ofless than ideal clarity ... if the agency's path may \nreasonably be discerned,\" Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, \n286 (197 4 ), the court cannot discern a reasoned assessment of \"litigation risk\" in this conclusory \nstatement.  See also Chenery II, 332 U.S. at 196-97 (stating that the grounds on which an agency \nreaches its decision \"must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable. It will not do for \na court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency's action; nor can a court be \nexpected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and \nindecisive.\").  The Administrative Record does not indicate, for example, that the Attorney \nGeneral made any reasoned assessment of the likelihood that DACA would be struck down in \nlight of its similarities to, or differences from D AP A; that he considered any potential defenses to \nthe \"potentially imminent litigation\"; that he acknowledged contrary rulings by other courts; or \nthat he assessed whether Department of Justice resources would be better spent elsewhere.  The \ncomt thus cannot conclude that the Attorney General actually considered \"litigation risk\" in any \n40 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 41 of 55 PageID #: 7336\nmeaningful sense.  Absent Defendants' post hoc explanations, the court would not have guessed \nthat Defendants made their decision for this reason. \nThe court views this \"litigation risk\" rationale as a mere post hoc rationalization, which is \ninsufficient to withstand arbitrary-and-capricious review.  State Fmm, 463 U.S. at 50; Burlington \nTruck Lines, 371 U.S. at 168-69.  Indeed, it is telling that, to substantiate their argument that the \nDACA rescission was motivated by concem for DACA recipients and a desire to avoid a \ndisorderly shut-down of the progrmn, Defendants resort to a press release, issued by Acting \nSecretary Duke, that fleshes out her reasons for ending the DACA program.  (Defs. Opp'n at 12 \n(quoting Press Release, DRS, Statement from Acting Secretary Duke on the Rescission of \nDACA (Sept. 5, 2017), https://www,dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/statement-acting-secretary-duke-\nrescission-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca).)  That press release is not in the record, \nhowever, so the court may not consider it.  See Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 419-20.  While \nDefendants assert that this rationale is reasonably discernible because Plaintiffs addressed it in \ntheir briefs (Defs. Opp'n at 12), Plaintiffs cannot be faulted for responding to an argument that \nDefendants have made throughout this litigation. 12 \nEven if the record indicated that Defendants made their decision based on \"litigation \nrisk,\" they acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so.  The Attomey General's conclusory \nstatement that it was \"likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with \nrespect to DACA\" falls well short of the APA's \"requirement that an agency provide reasoned \nexplanation for its action.\"  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 516.

Nor does the record indicate that \nDefendants considered~independent of their opinion that DACA was illegal~why litigating the \nrescission of DACA was preferable to litigating the decision to maintain the program.  See \nOrganized Viii. ofKake v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 795 F.3d 956,970 (9th Cir. 2015) (en bane) \n(litigation-risk rationale was arbitrary and capricious where agency's decision \"predictably led to \n... lawsuit\" and \"[a]t most ... deliberately traded one lawsuit for another\").  To the extent that \nDefendants now argue that their decision was based on a desire to avoid the harms that could \nresult to DACA beneficiaries from a disorderly end to the program, the record offers absolutely \nno indication that Defendants considered these impacts.  While Defendants ask the court to infer \na persuasive rationale from their conclusory statements and from the Southern District of Texas's \nand Fifth Circuit's opinions in Texas, it is not the court's job to \"supply a reasoned basis for the \nagency's action that the agency itselfhas not given.\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Even \naccepting for the sake of argument that the record provides some suppmt for Defendants' \n\"litigation risk\" rationale, that rationale is so inscrutable and unexplained that reliance upon it \nwas arbitrary and capricious. \nEven accepting for the sake of argument that \"litigation risk\" furnished a discernible, \nreasoned basis for Defendants' decision to end the DACA program, Defendants nevertheless \nacted arbitrarily and capriciously by ending that program without taking any account of reliance \ninterests that program has engendered.  To withstand review under the APA's arbitrary-and \ncapricious standard, an agency that is changing its policy need not explain why the reasons for \n42 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 43 of 55 PageID #: 7338\nthe new policy are better than the reasons for the old policy.  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at \n514-15.  The agency must nevertheless engage in reasoned decisionmaking, which, among other \nthings, means that the agency must consider \"serious reliance interests\" engendered by the \nprevious policy.  Id. at 515; see also Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navano, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125-\n27 (2016). \nPlaintiffs identify a number of reliance interests engendered by the DACA program, \nincluding that, in reliance on the continued existence of the program, DACA recipients have \n\"raised families, invested in their education, purchased homes and cars, and started careers\" (BV \nPis. Mot. at 16; State Pls. Mot. at 9-10); employers have hired, trained, and invested time in their \nDACA-recipient employees (BV Pis. Mot. at 17; State Pis. Mot. at 10); educational institutions \nhave emolled DACA recipients who, if they lose their DACA benefits, may be forced to leave \nthe United States or may see little need to continue pursuing educational opportunities (BV Pis. \nMot. at 17; State Pis. Mot. at 10); and states have expended resources modifying their motor \nvehicle and occupational licensing regimes to accommodate DACA recipients (State Pis. Mot. at \n10 & n.18).  The record does not indicate that Defendants acknowledged, let alone considered, \nthese or any other reliance interests engendered by the DACA program.  That alone is sufficient \nto render their supposedly discretionary decision to end the DACA program arbitrary and \ncapricious. \nDefendants' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  First, Defendants appear to \nargue that they did not need to discuss reliance interests because \"controlling legal precedent\" \nhad changed.  (Defs. Opp'n at 15.)  That argument confuses the requirement that the agency \nshow \"that there are good reasons for the new policy\" with the requirement that it not ignore \n\"serious reliance interests that must be taken into account\" when amending or rescinding an \n43 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 44 of 55 PageID #: 7339\nexisting policy.  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515.  In any event, it is hard to reconcile \nthis argument-in effect, that Defendants were compelled to terminate the DACA program \nwith their insistence elsewhere that the decision to end the DACA program was discretionary and \nthe product of reasoned deliberation. \nNext, Defendants appear to contend that they did not need to consider reliance interests \nengendered by the DACA policy because those interests were not \"longstanding\" or serious, to \nthe extent they existed.  (Defs. Opp'n at 16-17 .)  It is true that DACA recipients received \ndeferred action and work authorization for only two years at a time, that DHS retained discretion \nto revoke those benefits at any time, and that the 2012 DACA Memo \"confer[r ed] no substantive \nright.\"  (2012 DACA Memo at 3; Defs. Opp'n at 17.)  As a practical matter, however, it is \nobvious that hundreds of thousands ofDACA recipients and those close to them planned their \nlives around the program.  It is unrealistic to suggest that these reliance interests were not \n\"serious\" or \"substantial\" simply because DHS retained the ability to terminate DACA \nrecipients' deferred action at its discretion. \nMoreover, the cou1i does not see why the contingent, discretionary nature ofDACA \nbenefits means that, as Defendants argue, DACA recipients had no \"legally cognizable reliance \ninterests-and certainly not beyond the stated duration\" in the continued existence of the DACA \nprogram.  (Defs. Opp'n at 17 .)  In so contending, Defendants cross-reference their argument, \nmade in their October 27 Motion to Dismiss, that DACA beneficiaries had no \"'protected \nentitlement' for due process pmposes\" because '\"government officials may grant or deny \n[DACA benefits] in their discretion.\"'  (Defs. Oct. 27,2017, Mot. to Dismiss (Dkt. 95) (\"Defs. \nOct. 27 MTD\") at 35 (quoting Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005)) \n(emphasis added).)  Even accepting for the sake of argument that DACA recipients had no \n44 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 45 of 55 PageID #: 7340\nconstitutionally protected liberty or property interests in the continued existence of the DACA \nprogram and the renewal of their particular DACA applications, it does not follow that they had \nno reliance interests therein, such that Defendants were free to end the DACA program without \nconsidering such interests.  Encino Motorcars is instructive:  A car dealer may have not have a \nFifth Amendment entitlement to the Department of Labor's hewing to a particular interpretation \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act, but that does not mean that the Department is free to disregard \nreliance interests engendered by the longstanding interpretation ofthe Act when it alters its \nregulations.  See 136 S. Ct. at 2124-26. \nFinally, Defendants argue that Acting Secretary Duke effectively considered the relevant \nreliance interests by adopting a policy that resulted in an orderly wind-down, rather than an \nimmediate shut-down of the DACA program.  (Defs. Opp'n at 17-18.)  This is sleight-of-hand \nand further post hoc rationalization.  The record does not indicate that the Acting Secretary \nactually considered how the end of the DACA program would affect DACA recipients.  That her \nchosen policy may, in practice, ameliorate the impact of the DACA rescission on DACA \nrecipients, as compared to an immediate and disorderly shut-down of the program following a \nhypothetical injunction in the Texas litigation, does not mean that she actually considered this \npossibility.  While the Acting Secretary stated that she \"[r]ecogniz[ed] the complexities \nassociated with winding down the program,\" the Sessions Letter makes clear that these \ncomplexities referred to the burdens on DHS of winding down the DACA program.  (Compare \nDACA Rescission Memo at 4, with Sessions Ltr. (\"In light of the costs and burdens that will be \nimposed on DHS associated with rescinding this policy, DHS should consider an orderly and \nefficient wind-down process.\" (emphasis added)).) \n45 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 46 of 55 PageID #: 7341\nAccordingly, even ifthe record were to support Defendants' \"litigation risk\" rationale, \nthat rationale would be arbitrary and capricious.  Finally, even if this rationale were not arbitrary \nand capricious, the court would nevertheless likely vacate Defendants' decision because it is \ntainted by the errors discussed in Section III.A.l above.  \"When an agency relies on multiple \ngrounds for its decision, some of which are invalid, we may nonetheless sustain the decision as \nlong as one is valid and 'the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if the other \nwere unavailable.\"'  Mail Order Ass'n of Am. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 2 F.3d 408, 434 (D.C. Cir. \n1993) (quoting Syracuse Peace Council v. FCC, 867 F.2d 654, 657 (D.C. Cir. 1989)).  To the \nextent that Defendants' \"litigation risk\" rationale can be discemed from the Administrative \nRecord and the parties' submissions in these cases, that rationale appears to be intertwined with \nDefendants' enoneous legal conclusion that the DACA program was unlawful.  Because the \ncourt cannot say that Defendants clearly would have made the same decision even had they \ncorrectly understood the law and the holdings of the Texas courts, that decision is nevertheless \nlikely arbitrary and capricious.  See also N.Y. Pub. Interest Research Gm., 321 F.3d at 334 n.l3. \nb.  The Court Cannot Construe This Decision as an \"Independent \nPolicy Judgment\" \nDefendants also contend that, even if the comt disagrees with the Attomey General's \nconclusion that DACA is unconstitutional, the comt may nevettheless uphold the decision to end \nthe DACA program because the same facts that led the Attomey General to conclude that the \nDACA program is unconstitutional \"equally support a policy judgment by the Acting Secretary \nthat deferred action should be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis rather than \nused as a tool to confer certain benefits that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by \nlaw.\"  (Defs. Opp'n at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).)  The record, however, \noffers no support for the notion that Defendants based their decision on any \"policy judgment \n46 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 47 of 55 PageID #: 7342\nthat immigration decisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.\"  iliD  Defendants' \nargument therefore conflicts with fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action \nnamely that the court reviews the agency's stated reasons for its decision and \"may not supply a \nreasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given.\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. \nat 43; see also Chenery II, 332 U.S. at 196; Chenery I, 318 U.S. at 87. \nDefendants' only authority for this novel argument, Syracuse Peace Council, 867 F.2d at \n654, is inapposite.  In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that when an agency bases its decision on \nboth a judgment about constitutionality and policy reasons, the reviewing court may uphold the \ndecision if the agency clearly would have reached the same decision for policy reasons alone, \neven if the agency stated that its constitutional and policy rationales were \"intertwined.\"  I d. at \n655-57.  Syracuse Peace Council does not stand for the proposition that, when an agency bases \nits decision on constitutional grounds, a reviewing court may, in the first instance, construe that \ndecision as having been based on a \"policy judgment\" found nowhere in the administrative \nrecord. \n*  *  * \nFor the reasons stated above, the court concludes that Plaintiffs are substantially likely to \nprevail on the merits of their claim that the decision to rescind the DACA program was arbitrary, \ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion. \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs have also demonstrated that they are likely to suffer ilTeparable harm if the \ncourt does not enjoin Defendants from fully implementing the DACA rescission. \n\"To satisfy the ineparable harm requirement, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that absent a \npreliminary injunction they will suffer an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual \nand imminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a court waits until the end of trial to resolve \n47 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 48 of 55 PageID #: 7343\nthe harm.\"  Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60,66 (2d Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005)).  Irreparable harm \n\"cannot be remedied by an award of monetary damages.\"  State of New York ex rel. \nSchneiderman, 787 F.3d at 660. \nPlaintiffs have extensively documented the irreparable harms they will suffer if the \nDACA program ends.  Each day, approximately 122 DACA recipients who failed (or were \nunable) to renew their DACA status before October 5, 2017, lose their deferred action and work \nauthorization.  (BV Pls. Mot at 1-2, 35; State Pls. Mot. at 28.)  Ifthe implementation of the \nDACA Rescission Memo is not enjoined, approximately 1,400 DACA recipients will lose \ndeferred action each work day, beginning on March 5, 2018.  (State Pls. Mot. at 28.)  As a result, \nthese individuals will face the possibility of deportation from the country.  While this possibility \nof deportation is clearly extremely worrisome to DACA recipients, the court declines to grant a \npreliminary injunction on this basis.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 21-22; see also Carlsson v. U.S. \nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., No. 12-CV-7893 (CAS), 2012 WL 4758118, at *9 (C.D. Cal. \nOct. 3, 2012) (risk of deportation speculative, not imminent, when there were no pending \nremoval proceedings against the plaintiffs).13  Nor may the court grant a preliminary injunction \non the grounds that DACA recipients may, for fear of deportation, suffer from anxiety or \ndepression, lose the \"abilit[y] to plan for the future and make commitments, whether familial, \ncareer-based, academic, or otherwise\" (BV Pls. Mot. at 37-38), or be required to tum their U.S. \ncitizen children over to the care of the State Plaintiffs' child welfare systems, or that public \np1hD3rt eitoTpprsohi:rte/it/ ziwcneowg ut hwDret . r nperoeoamtmleitosei cvrtsoha  .alWc too SofmDen/c'sAtrt eoBCtraeyAr  /ya2 r  0NPe1criii8eopl/ris0eie tInvn /t 1 sfr6 oew/crd ehIhnCost -Elhdy arI dseft a Tanmtoaeeltdk rc sstoh- Fdmaaetm,ip leo,i vtrPtteeaondtlii  ioctfirnc it-omhn eoe( JDsta-. pnA.rS Cieo1Aer6 i, Ltp2yor0-ou31gi48sr0 ,aN 6m88e: 1l3es.0no Adne,M dD,) HD, SH CS hwieofu: ld not \n48 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 49 of 55 PageID #: 7344\nsafety will be hanned because former DACA recipients will be less likely to report crimes and \nother harms to the community (State Pis. Mot. at 28).  Because deportation is, at this point, not \nsufficiently \"likely\" for purposes of establishing irreparable hatm, harms accruing from the fear \nof deportation are also too speculative to support the grant of a preliminary injunctioiL \nConcomitant with the loss of deferred action, however, DACA recipients will also lose \ntheir work authorization.  As a result, they will be legally unemployable in this country.  Some \nDACA recipients will lose their employer-sponsored healthcare coverage, which will endanger \nDACA recipients and their families (BV Pis. Mot. at 36-37) and impose tremendous burdens on \nthe State Plaintiffs' public health systems (State Pis. Mot. at 31-32).  Other DACA recipients, \ndue to the imminent loss of their employment, may lose their homes or need to drop out of \nschool.  (BV Pis. Mot. at 37.)  Employers will suffer due to the inability to hire or retain \nerstwhile DACA recipients, affecting their operations on an ongoing basis and causing them to \nincur unrecoverable economic losses.  (!d, at 38; State Pis. Mot. at 29-30.)  Finally, the DACA \nrescission will result in \"staggering\" adverse economic impacts, including, by the State \nPlaintiffs' best lights, $215 billion in lost GDP over the next decade, and $797 million in lost \nstate and local tax revenue.  (State Pis. Mot. at 33 & nn.77-78.)  Thus, while it may be true that \n\"[l]oss of employment does not in and of itself constitute irreparable injury,\" Savage v. Gorski, \n850 F.2d 64, 67 (2d Cir. 1988), these cases present a \"genuinely extraordinary situation\" \nwarranting injunctive relief, Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61,92 n.68 (1974). \nWhile the above is sufficient to demonstrate irrepm·able harm, the court also notes the \nobvious fact that the decision to rescind DACA, if carried into effect, will have profound and \nirreversible economic and social implications.  That decision \"will profoundly disrupt the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of people.\"  In reUnited States, 875 F.3d 1200, 1210 (9th Cir. 2017) \n49 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 50 of 55 PageID #: 7345\n(Watford, J., dissenting).  It may force one out of every four hundred U.S. workers out ofthe \nlawful workforce.  See Jie Zong et al., \"A Profile of Current DACA Recipients by Education, \nIndustry, and Occupation,\" Migration Policy Institute (Nov. 20 17), \nhttps://www.migrationpolicy.org/researchlprofile-current-daca-recipients-education-industry \nand-occupation.  Former DACA recipients will be separated from their families and \ncommunities.  It is impossible to understand the full consequences of a decision of this \nmagnitude.  If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, \nthere is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the \nrecord before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision. \nMoreover, it is also impossible for the court to adjudicate this dispute on the merits \nbefore March 5, 2018, when these harms will begin to materialize in earnest.  Defendants set an \naggressive timetable for ending the DACA program and have pursued various dilatory tactics \nthroughout this litigation.  Notably, they have yet to produce a plausible administrative record in \nthese cases, without which the court cannot render a merits decision.  Overton Park, 401 U.S. at \n420.  For these reasons, it is clear that Plaintiffs will suffer substantial and imminent irreparable \nhatm ifthe court does not preliminarily enjoin the DACA rescission. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have not shown that irreparable harm is \"imminent, or \neven likely, given the preliminaty injunction recently issued\" in Regents.  (Defs. Opp'n at 48.) \nDefendants are, however, vigorously contesting that injunction before both the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme CoUlt.  If Judge Alsup or the Ninth Circuit \nwere to lift the injunction in Regents, then Plaintiffs would no doubt suffer irreparable harm. \nDefendants cite no authority for the proposition that Plaintiffs cannot establish irreparable harm \nsimply because another court has already enjoined the same challenged action. \n50 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 51 of 55 PageID #: 7346\nC.  Balancing the Equities and the Public Interest \nFinally, the court must consider whether \"the balance of equities tips in [Plaintiffs'] \nfavor\" and if\"an injunction is in the public interest.\"  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  To make this \ndecision, the court \"balance[s J   the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \neach party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief,\" as well as \"the public \nconsequences of employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.\"  I d. at 24 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  \"These factors merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.\" Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  The court concludes that these factors weigh firmly in \nPlaintiffs' favor. \nThe court need not restate at length the consequences of the DACA rescission for \nPlaintiffs, other DACA recipients, those close to them, and the public at large.  Allowing the \nDACA rescission to take immediate effect would quickly cost many DACA recipients the \nopportunity to work legally in this country, and hence to support themselves and their families. \nEnjoining the implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo would also preserve the status \nquo, enabling a full resolution of this matter on the merits, rather than allowing severe social \ndislocations to unfold based on an agency decision that, as noted above, strongly appears to have \nbeen arbitrary and capricious.  The public interest is not served by allowing Defendants to \nproceed with arbitrary and capricious action. \nAgainst these considerations, the court weighs the effect on Defendants of initiating a \nwind-down of the DACA program on their predetermined timetable.  The court does not step in \nthis area lightly.  Defendants have broad discretion to set immigration-enforcement priorities. \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 394.  Moreover, the DACA program was originally created by the \nExecutive Branch, and the Trump Administration should be able to alter the policies and \npriorities set by its predecessor. \n51 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 52 of 55 PageID #: 7347\nThere are, however, several factors that lead the court to conclude that the balance of the \nequities favors granting an injunction.  Defendants do not appear to have rescinded the DACA \nprogram as an exercise of their discretion, or because of a reasoned policy judgment, but instead, \nat least in significant part, because they erroneously concluded that the program was \nunconstitutional and unlawful.  Enjoining Defendants from rescinding the DACA program on \nerroneous legal grounds therefore does not intrude on their discretion or well-established \nauthority to set immigration-enforcement policies.  Moreover, although the Government \ngenerally has a substantial interest in the speedy deportation of removable aliens because their \npresence here \"pennit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States law,\" Nken, 556 \nU.S. at 436 (quoting AAADC, 525 U.S. at 490), the court finds that the Government's interest in \nending the DACA program is not so compelling.  For one thing, the President has stated his \nsuppmt for keeping DACA recipients in the country (albeit preferably pursuant to legislation \nrather than executive action).  Donald J. Trnmp, @realdonaldtrump, Twitter.com (Sept. 14, 2017 \n3:28AM), https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/908276308265795585 (\"Does anybody \nreally want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some \nserving in the military?  Really!. .... \").  The current DHS Secretmy has also stated that the \nerstwhile DACA recipients would not be a priority for immigration enforcement.  Louis Nelson, \nDHS Chief: Deporting Dreamers Won't Be a Priority for ICE If Talks Fail, Politico (Jan. 16, \n20 18), https:// www.politico.com/stmy/20 18/0 1/16/dhs-dreamers-depmtation-not-priority-\n340681.  Even if deporting DACA recipients were a priority of the Administration, an injunction \nagainst the end of the DACA program would not impede this policy, as, under the 2012 DACA \n52 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 53 of 55 PageID #: 7348\nMemo, DHS retains discretion to revoke specific DACA recipients' deferred action and work \nauthorization.14 \nAccordingly, the court finds that the balance of the equities tip decidedly in Plaintiffs' \nfavor, and that the public interest would be well-served by an injunction. \nD.  Scope of Relief \nFor the foregoing reasons, the court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are \nentitled to a preliminary injunction.  Defendants are therefore ORDERED to maintain the DACA \nprogram on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the promulgation of the DACA \nRescission Memo, subject to the following limitations.  Defendants need not consider new \napplications by individuals who have never before obtained DACA benefits; need not continue \ngranting \"advanced parole\" to DACA beneficiaries; and, of course, may adjudicate DACA \nrenewal requests on a case-by-case, individualized basis.  See Regents, 2018 WL 33 9144, at *28. \nPlaintiffs contend that the court should require Defendants to restore the DACA program \nas it existed on September 4, 2017, in pmticular by requiring Defendants to adjudicate initial \nDACA applications submitted by individuals who only became eligible for DACA after that \ndate.  (Jan. 30,2018, Hr'g Tr. (Dkt. Number Pending) 8:24-25.) As in Regents, however, the \ncourt finds that the irreparable harms identified by Plaintiffs largely result from Defendants' \nexpected failure to renew existing grants of deferred action and especially work authorization, \nnot from Defendants' refusal to adjudicate new initial DACA applications.  While the court is \nsympathetic to the plight of individuals who were unable to apply for DACA before September \n5, 2017, it cannot say that Plaintiffs have demonstrated either that these individuals would be \n14  The court expresses no view as to whether the revocation of existing DACA benefits would be consistent with the \nDue Process Clause or other potentially applicable protections. \n53 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 54 of 55 PageID #: 7349\nirreparably harmed without injunctive relief or that the balance of equities favors these \nindividuals to the same extent it favors existing DACA beneficiaries. \nThe court enjoins rescission of the DACA program on a universal or \"nationwide\" basis. \nAgain, it does not do so lightly.  As Defendants correctly note, equitable principles provide that \nthe court should not enter an injunction that is broader than \"necessary to provide complete relief \nto the plaintiffs.\"  (Defs. Opp'n at 50 (quoting Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. \n753, 765 (1994)).)  See also Church & Dwight Co. v. SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics, GmBH, \n843 F.3d 48, 72 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"[I]njunctive relief should be no broader than necessary to cure \nthe effects of the hann caused by the violation ....\"  (intemal quotation marks and citations \nomitted)).  Moreover, several academic commentators have insightfully observed various \nproblems with the practice of granting nationwide injunctions against the Govenunent, including \nthat such injunctions thwart the development of law in different courts, encourage forum \nshopping, and create the possibility that different courts will issue conflicting nationwide \ninjunctions.  See Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 \nHarv. L. Rev. 417 (2017); Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(b)(2), and the \nRemedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 611 (2017); Zayn Siddique, Nationwide \nInjunctions, 117 Colum. L. Rev. 2095 (2017); Getzel Berger, Note, Nationwide Injunctions \nAgainst the Federal Govenunent: A Structural Approach, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1068 (2017). \nNevertheless, the court finds that a nationwide injunction is warranted in these cases. \nFirst, it is hard to conceive of how the court would craft a narrower injunction that would \nadequately protect Plaintiffs' interests.  Plaintiffs include not only several individuals and a \nnonprofit organization, but also sixteen states and the District of Columbia.  To protect the State \nPlaintiffs' interests, the court would presumably need to enjoin Defendants from rescinding the \n54 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 209   Filed 02/13/18   Page 55 of 55 PageID #: 7350\nDACA program with respect to the State Plaintiffs' residents and employees, including the \nemployees of any instrumentalities of the state, such as public hospitals, schools, and \nuniversities.  Such an injunction would be unworkable, partly in light of the simple fact that \npeople move from state to state and job to job, and would likely create administrative problems \nfor Defendants.  Furthetmore, there is a strong federal interest in the uniformity of federal \nimmigration law. See U.S. Const. art. I,§ 8, cl. 4 (empowering Congress to \"establish a uniform \nRule ofNaturalization\"); Texas, 809 F.3d at 187-88.  Because the decision to rescind the DACA \nprogram had a \"systemwide impact,\" the court will preliminarily impose a \"systemwide \nremedy.\" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343,359 (1996) (quoting Dayton Bd. ofEduc. v. Brinkman, \nu.s. \n433  406,420 (1977)). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 123 in No. 16-CV-4756; Dkt. 96 in \nNo. 17-CV -5228) are GRANTED.

The States of New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia (the “States”) bring this action to protect \nthe States—including their residents, employers, small governmental jurisdictions, regulatory \nsystems, and educational institutions—against the unlawful actions of the President of the United \nStates and the federal government.  \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 2 of 99 PageID #: 7733\n2.  Since 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program has \nprotected from deportation and extended work authorization to over 825,000 young people who \ngrew up in this country, most of whom have known no home other than the United States.  \n3.  DACA has allowed these young people to live, study, and work in the States (and \nthroughout the country) as contributors and leaders in their communities. DACA grantees attend \npublic and private universities, and are employed by companies, nonprofit organizations, and \ngovernmental agencies and institutions, all of which benefit from their skills and productivity. \nDACA grantees also provide financial support to their families, help to grow the economy, and \ncontribute significantly to State and local revenues and tax bases.  \n4.  On September 5, 2017, the Defendants definitively and categorically terminated \nthe DACA program, as detailed in a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \nMemorandum by former Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke (“2017 DHS \nMemorandum”). See Ex. 741 (Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine Duke to James \nMcCament, Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Rescission of \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, September 5, 2017).  \n5.  Ending DACA is a culmination of President’s Trump’s oft-stated commitments—\nwhether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some \ncombination thereof—to punish and disparage immigrants, especially those with Mexican roots, \nwho make up more than 78 percent of DACA grantees. See Ex. 1 (Updated USCIS, \nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017, June 8, 2017).  \n                                                 \n1 References to Exs. 1 to 179 in this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint are to the Exhibits docketed on \nOctober 4, 2017, at ECF No. 55.

Pursuant to the 2017 DHS Memorandum, the federal government began only to \nissue renewals for grantees whose benefits expire before March 5, 2018, provided they apply for \nrenewal by October 5, 2018. DHS immediately ceased accepting all new applications under \nDACA. \n7.  In 2018, this Court entered a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to continue \nprocessing renewal applications. See Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401 (E.D.N.Y. \n2018). The federal government petitioned for certiorari while its appeal was pending before the \nSecond Circuit, and the Supreme Court granted that petition along with the federal government’s \npetitions for certiorari in parallel litigation in the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n8.  On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that Duke’s 2017 rescission of DACA \nwas arbitrary and capricious under the APA. See Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of \nUniv. of California (“Regents”), 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020). Among other things, the Supreme \nCourt expressly affirmed in full a summary judgment ruling “that DACA’s rescission was \nunlawful and must be set aside.” NAACP v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 473 (D.D.C. 2018); see \nRegents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916 & n.7. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court denied the federal \ngovernment’s petition for certiorari from a Fourth Circuit summary judgment ruling vacating the \n2017 rescission of DACA as arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Casa de Md. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Homeland Security, 924 F.3d 684, 706 (4th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, — S.Ct. —, 2020 WL \n3492650 (Mem.) (U.S. June 29, 2010) (No. 18-1469).  \n9.  On June 30, 2020, the Fourth Circuit issued the mandate associated with its \nsummary judgment ruling. Mandate, Casa de Maryland, 18-1521, ECF No. 71 (4th Cir. June 30, \n2020).  The issuance of that mandate had the effect of vacating the 2017 DACA rescission \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 4 of 99 PageID #: 7735\nnationwide. See, e.g., New York v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 19-3591, 2020 WL \n4457951, at *31 (2d Cir. Aug. 4, 2020) (describing the effect of a final judgment vacating agency \naction under the APA). \n10.  Notwithstanding Regents and the Fourth Circuit’s mandate, DHS did not \nrecommence processing DACA applications but instead “generally held” applications “in \nanticipation of potential policy changes.” Ex. 180 (Chad F. Wolf, Reconsideration of the June \n15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children,” July 28, 2020 (Wolf Memo)). \n11.  On July 28, 2020, Defendant Chad Wolf—in his capacity as purported Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security—issued a memorandum directing DHS to make interim changes \nto DACA while Wolf considered whether to fully rescind DACA. Id. In particular, the Wolf \nMemo orders DHS to reject all new initial DACA applications, to change the renewal period for \ncurrent beneficiaries from two years to one year, and to reject all advance parole applications \nabsent exceptional circumstances. Id. at 7-8. \n12.  The Wolf Memo purports to apply these changes retroactively to all applications \nsubmitted after the June 18, 2020 Regents decision. Ex. 180 at 7 (Wolf Memo).  \n13.  Because Defendant Wolf was improperly serving in the role of Acting Secretary \nof Homeland Security in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (“FVRA”), 5 \nU.S.C. § 3341 et seq., and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. § 111 et seq.  (“HSA”), \nhe lacked the authority to issue the memorandum or to direct the changes to DACA pursuant to \nit.  Accordingly, the Wolf Memo is an ultra vires agency action that was void ab initio. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 5 of 99 PageID #: 7736\n14.  The consequence of Defendants’ decisions is that hundreds of thousands of young \npeople who have availed themselves of the program will ultimately lose some or all of its \nprotections, and will be exposed to removal when their authorizations expire.  \n15.  Individuals who have relied on DACA are now even more vulnerable to removal \nthan before the program was initiated, as they turned over sensitive information to the federal \ngovernment in their applications. Despite the federal government’s repeated promises that it \nwould not use such information to conduct enforcement measures, the 2017 DHS Memorandum \nand Wolf Memo do not explain how the government will keep that information secure, nor does \nit provide any assurances that immigration enforcement agents will not use such information to \nfind and remove those who applied for DACA.  \n16.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus will harm hundreds of thousands of the States’ residents, injure State-run colleges and \nuniversities, upset the States’ workplaces, damage the States’ economies, hurt State-based \nbusinesses and nonprofits, negatively affect the States’ small governmental jurisdictions, and \ndisrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory interests.  \n17.  The States respectfully request that the Court invalidate the Wolf Memo and the \nportions of the 2017 DHS Memorandum challenged here, and vacate any changes effected to the \nDACA program by the Wolf Memo. Further, the States ask that the Court enjoin the federal \ngovernment from using personal information gathered for the DACA program in immigration \nenforcement. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 6 of 99 PageID #: 7737\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.

Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n24.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \nDACA program. DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government, and is \nan agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n25.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is an \nOperational and Support Component agency within DHS. USCIS is the sub-agency responsible \nfor administering the DACA program. \n26.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is an Operational \nand Support Component agency within DHS. ICE is responsible for enforcing federal \nimmigration law, including identifying, apprehending, detaining, and removing non-citizens. \n27.  Defendant Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.3 He is \nresponsible for implementing and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act, and oversees \nUSCIS and ICE. He is sued in his official capacity. \n28.  Defendant the United States of America includes all government agencies and \ndepartments responsible for the implementation, modification, and termination of the DACA \nprogram. \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs refer to Defendant Wolf by reference to the title DHS has designated for him, without conceding that he \nis lawfully exercising the powers of that position, as alleged in Plaintiffs’ Ninth Claim for Relief below. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 8 of 99 PageID #: 7739\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \nEstablishment of the DACA Program. \n29.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \nmemorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”). See Ex. 13 \n(2012 DACA Memorandum). Under DACA, “certain young people who were brought to this \ncountry as children and know only this country as home” could request deferred action for a \nperiod of two years, subject to renewal. Id. at 1-2. DACA grantees also were eligible for work \nauthorizations so that they could work legally in the United States during the deferred action \nperiod, pursuant to long-standing federal regulation. See id.; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) \n(providing that “an alien who has been granted deferred action” may obtain work authorization \nupon demonstrating economic necessity). \n30.  Deferred action is a well-established form of prosecutorial discretion under which \nthe federal government forbears from taking removal action against an individual for a \ndesignated period of time. According to the 2012 DACA memorandum, it was appropriate for \nthe government to exercise such discretion for DACA grantees because immigration laws are not \n“designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or \neven speak the language.” See Ex. 13 at 1.   \n31.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum provided that an applicant could be considered \nfor an exercise of prosecutorial discretion only if he or she:  \na.  came to the United States before the age of sixteen;  \nb.  continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding  \nJune 15, 2012, and was present in the United States on that date;  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 9 of 99 PageID #: 7740\nc.  was in enrolled in school on the date of his/her application, had graduated \nfrom high school, had obtained a general education development certificate, or \nwas an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of \nthe United States;  \nd.  had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor \noffense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses, and did not otherwise pose a \nthreat to national security or public safety; and  \ne.  was not over the age of thirty on June 15, 2012. \nId. at 1.  \n32.  USCIS described DACA as follows: “Deferred action is a discretionary \ndetermination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For \npurposes of future inadmissibility based upon unlawful presence, an individual whose case has \nbeen deferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred \naction is in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be \npresent in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during \nthe period deferred action is in effect. However, deferred action does not confer lawful status \nupon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.” \nSee Ex. 14, Question 1 (USCIS Help Center, DACA FAQs). \nThe DACA Application Process. \n33.  Under DACA, “[a]ll individuals who believe[d] they [met] the guidelines” could \n“affirmatively request consideration of DACA from USCIS” through an established process. \nAfter receiving the applicant’s forms, evidence, supporting documents and application fee, \nUSCIS “review[ed] them for completeness,” considered complete applications “on an individual, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 10 of 99 PageID #: 7741\ncase-by-case basis,” and notified applicants of its determination in writing. See Ex. 16 (USCIS \nHelp Center, How do I request consideration of DACA?). \n34.  In order to apply for the DACA program, applicants had to submit extensive \ndocumentation establishing that they met the eligibility criteria. Applicants also had to submit a \nForm I-765 Application for Employment Authorization, and pay a $495 fee. See Ex. 14 at \nQuestions 28-41; see also Ex. 17 (USCIS, I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals) (explaining that the filing fee for a DACA application could not be waived).   \n35.  DACA applicants were required to undergo biometric and biographic background \nchecks. When conducting these checks, DHS reviewed the applicant’s biometric and biographic \ninformation “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government \nagencies.” See Ex. 14 at Question 23. If any information “indicate[d] that [the applicant’s] \npresence in the United States threaten[ed] public safety or national security,” the applicant was \nineligible for DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.” Id. at Question 65. \n36.  Once individuals were admitted into the DACA program, internal USCIS \n“Standard Operating Procedures” dictated that, absent an “Egregious Public Safety” issue, \nDACA grantees were not to be terminated from the program until the government provided a \n“Notice of Intent to Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[ed]” the grounds for the \ntermination.” See Ex. 18 at 132, Appendix I (DHS, National Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Apr. 4, 2013). DHS policy further provided that \nrecipients of such notice should be afforded 33 days to “file a brief or statement contesting the \ngrounds cited in the Notice of Intent to Terminate” prior to termination of participation in the \nDACA program. Id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 11 of 99 PageID #: 7742\n37.  At the expiration of their two-year DACA term, grantees could seek renewal, and \nwere considered for renewal if they met the guidelines for consideration as well as other \nspecified criteria. See Ex. 19 (USCIS Help Center, How will USCIS evaluate my request for \nrenewal of DACA?). \nBenefits Provided Under the DACA Program. \n38.  DACA confers numerous benefits on its grantees.  \n39.  Notably, DACA grantees are granted the right not to be arrested or detained based \nsolely on their immigration status during the time period during which their deferred action is in \neffect. See Ex. 14 at Question 9. \n40.  DACA grantees also are granted eligibility for work authorization. As USCIS has \nexplained, “an individual whose case has been deferred is eligible to receive employment \nauthorization for the period of deferred action . . . .’” Id. at Question 1.  \n41.  DACA grantees are eligible to receive certain public benefits. These include \nSocial Security, retirement, and disability benefits. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d).  \n42.  DACA enables grantees to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards, start \nbusinesses, purchase homes and cars, and conduct other aspects of daily life that are otherwise \noften unavailable for undocumented immigrants. See Ex. 5 ¶ ¶  12, 16, 22 (Decl. Wong). \n43.  DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands of young people “to enroll in colleges \nand universities, complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and \ngive back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs—\nall on the books.” See Ex. 15 (Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson to Rep. Judy Chu, Dec. \n30, 2016). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 12 of 99 PageID #: 7743\n44.  These positive effects have rippled throughout the States’ economies. As DHS \nrecognized more than four years after the implementation of DACA, our nation “continue[s] to \nbenefit . . . from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want \nnothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Id.  \n45.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus would not only rip away the life-changing benefits to individual DACA grantees, but \nwould also reverse the benefits to the community at large, including to innumerable small \nbusinesses, non-profits, and governments.4  \nThe Government’s Assurances That the Information Provided by DACA Applicants \nWould be Kept Confidential and Not Used for Enforcement. \n \n46.  When the DACA program was first implemented, many eligible young people \nwere reluctant to voluntarily disclose information that could help facilitate their removal from \nthe United States. To encourage applications, DHS repeatedly promised applicants that \ninformation they provided as part of the DACA application process would “not later be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes.” See Ex. 15 (Letter from Sec’y Johnson). \n47.  USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that, except in limited \ncircumstances, “[i]nformation provided in [a DACA request] is protected from disclosure to ICE \nand CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.” See Ex. 25 (USCIS Help \n                                                 \n4 See e.g., Ex. 20 (Ike Brannon, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA, the Cato Institute, Jan. 18, \n2017) (“The deportation of DACA participants would cost the American economy billions of dollars, as well as \nbillions of tax dollars foregone, while doing little to address the true concerns that Americans may have about \nunauthorized immigrants.”); Ex. 21 (Tom Wong, et al., DACA Grantees’ Economic and Educational Gains Continue \nto Grow, Center for American Progress,  Aug. 28, 2017) (quoting multiple DACA grantees whose small businesses \nwill suffer or even close if DACA is terminated); Ex. 22 (Tom Wong et al., New Study of DACA Beneficiaries Shows \nPositive Economic and Educational Outcomes, Center for American Progress, Oct. 18, 2016) (study showing that 9 \npercent of DACA grantees work at non-profits, a significant percentage work in education, and 6 percent started their \nown business, including one owner who employs nine people and hopes to continue to grow and “hire even more \npeople from the community” [internal brackets and quotation marks omitted]). \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 13 of 99 PageID #: 7744\nCenter, Will the information I share in my request for DACA be used for immigration \nenforcement purposes?). \n48.  USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that, except in limited \ncircumstances, their case would not be “referred to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings” \neven if UCSIS decided not to defer action on a case. See Ex. 26 (USCIS Help Center, If USCIS \ndoes not exercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?). \n49.  In the exceptional circumstance in which USCIS referred a DACA applicant to \nICE, USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that “information related to [their] \nfamily members or guardians that is contained in [their] request [would] not be referred to ICE \nfor purposes of immigration enforcement against family members or guardians.” See Ex. 27 \n(USCIS Help Center, If my DACA case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes \nor if I receive an NTA, will information related to my family members and guardians also be \nreferred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes?). \n50.  USCIS affirmatively represented to employers of DACA applicants that, except in \nlimited circumstances, if they provided an employee \"with information regarding his or her \nemployment to support a request for consideration of DACA,” the information would not be \n“shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes.” See Ex. 28 (USCIS Help \nCenter, If I provide my employee with information regarding his or her employment to support a \nrequest for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement \npurposes against me and/or my company?). \n51.  The government’s representations that, absent exceptional circumstances, \ninformation provided by a DACA grantee would not be used against him or her for later \nimmigration enforcement proceedings were unequivocal and atypical. For example, the federal \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 14 of 99 PageID #: 7745\ngovernment does not make the same representations for participants in other similar programs, \nsuch as Temporary Protected Status. These assurances were key to the success of the DACA \nprogram. By making repeated, unique, and strong representations, the federal government \ninduced persons to rely on those representations and apply to become DACA grantees despite the \npotential risks. \nThe Government’s Commitment to Continuity and Fair Treatment for DACA Grantees. \n52.  Numerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced the federal \ngovernment’s promise to provide continuity and fair treatment to DACA grantees, and have \nrecognized that DACA grantees have relied on the government’s representations in applying for \nDACA. For example, in December 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles \nJohnson acknowledged that there are hundreds of thousands of DACA grantees who have “relied \non the U.S. government’s representations” about DACA, and asserted that “representations made \nby the U.S. government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to \nbe honored.” See Ex. 15. \n53.  On December 19, 2016, then-President-elect Trump stated in an interview with \nTIME magazine that he would find an accommodation for DACA grantees, stating, “We’re going \nto work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud.” See Ex. 29 (Michael \nScherer, Person of the Year 2016, TIME Magazine, Dec. 19, 2016). He further recognized, \n“[DACA grantees] got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to \nschool here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never \nland because they don’t know what’s going to happen.” Id. \n54.  Again, on January 18, 2017, then President-elect Trump promised in an interview \nwith Fox & Friends that he was working on a plan to make DACA grantees “very happy.” See \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 15 of 99 PageID #: 7746\nEx. 30 (Francesca Chambers, Trump signals he’s softening on immigration as he says he’s \n‘working on a plan’ that will make DREAMers ‘very happy,’  Daily Mail, Jan. 18, 2017). He \nfurther stated, “We’re working on a plan right now. And that plan, over the next two to three \nmonths, is going to come out. And it’s a plan that’s going to be very firm, but it’s going to have a \nlot of heart.” Id. \n55.  In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the government must \nensure that “the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” DACA grantees, who have “organize[d] \n[their] li[ves] around” the DACA program. See Ex. 31 (CNN, Transcript of CNN Town Hall with \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, Jan. 12, 2017).   \n56.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump again stated in an interview with David \nMuir that “[DACA grantees] shouldn’t be very worried. I do have a big heart.” See Ex. 32 (ABC \nNews, Transcript of ABC News anchor David Muir interview with Donald Trump, Jan. 25, \n2017). \n57.  In February 2017, then-Secretary of DHS John Kelly issued a memorandum \nrelating to enforcement priorities. This memorandum terminated “all existing conflicting \ndirectives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and \npriorities for removal,” including prior enforcement priorities, but left DACA unchanged. See \nEx. 2 (Memorandum from Secretary John Kelly to Keven McAleenan, Acting CBP \nCommissioner, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest, Feb. 20, \n2017); see also Ex. 10 (Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Enhancing Public \nSafety in the Interior of the United States, Feb. 21, 2017) (“Q22: Do these memoranda affect \nrecipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)? A22: No.”).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 16 of 99 PageID #: 7747\n58.  On March 29, 2017, Secretary Kelly reaffirmed that “DACA status” is a \n“commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person, or the so-called Dreamer.” See \nEx. 33 (Ted Hesson & Seung Min Kim, Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on \nImmigration, Politico, Mar. 29, 2017).    \n59.  On April 21, 2017, President Trump represented that his Administration’s policy \nwas not to deport DACA grantees, and suggested that they “should rest easy.” See Ex. 34 (The \nAssociated Press, Interview Transcript, Apr. 21, 2017). \n60.  On June 15, 2017, Secretary Kelly issued a memo terminating the Deferred \nAction for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) program created in \n2014, but keeping DACA in place. See Ex. 23 (Memorandum from Secretary John Kelly to \nKeven McAleenan, Acting CBP Commissioner, Rescission of November 20, 2014 Memorandum \nProviding for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, June \n15, 2017). \n61.  The government’s commitment to the DACA program was further communicated \nto young people through DHS’s publication entitled “National Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)” (the “DACA SOP”). See Ex. 18. This \ndocument includes more than 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or denying deferred \naction. \n62.  Moreover, the approval notice granting deferred action under DACA listed only \n“fraud or misrepresentation” in the application process or “[s]ubsequent criminal activity” as \ngrounds for revoking DACA. See Ex. 24 (USCIS, DACA Approval Notice). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 17 of 99 PageID #: 7748\n63.  In reliance on these representations, hundreds of thousands of young people \napplied to participate in the DACA program, or sought renewal of their benefits since 2017. See \nEx. 1.  \nPresident Trump’s Statements about Mexicans. \n64.  Despite these various and repeated promises to DACA grantees made by the \nfederal government and by President Trump, including a recognition of DACA’s continued legal \nviability, value, and successes, President Trump has a long history of disparaging Mexicans, who \ncomprise the vast majority of DACA grantees.  \n65.  In announcing his presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump compared \nMexican immigrants to rapists, stating: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their \nbest. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re \nbringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re \nrapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” See Ex. 35 (Washington Post, Transcript of \nDonald Trump’s Presidential Bid Announcement, June 16, 2015). \n66.  During the first Republican presidential debate, then-candidate Trump again \nstated his distaste for immigrants from Mexico: “The Mexican government is much smarter, \nmuch sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don’t want to \npay for them. They don’t want to take care of them.” See Ex. 36 (Andrew O’Reilly, At GOP \ndebate, Trump says ‘stupid’ U.S. leaders are being duped by Mexico, Fox News, Aug. 6, 2015). \n67.   Soon after, on August 25, 2015, then-candidate Trump refused to answer \nquestions about immigration posed by Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-American and the top news \nanchor at Univision, a Spanish-language news network. After sending his bodyguard to \nphysically remove Mr. Ramos, then-candidate Trump derisively told Mr. Ramos to “Go back to \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 18 of 99 PageID #: 7749\nUnivision.” See Ex. 37 (Phillip Rucker, First, Trump booted Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out \nof his news conference. Then things got interesting, The Washington Post, Aug. 25, 2015).  \n68.  In May 2016, then-candidate Trump referred to anti-Trump protestors who carried \nthe Mexican flag as “criminals” and “thugs.” See Ex. 38 (Donald Trump, “The protestors in New \nMexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican Flag,” Twitter, May 25, 2016); See Ex. 39 \n(Donald Trump, “Many of the thugs that attacked peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were \nillegals,” Twitter, June 4, 2016). \n69.  In June 2016, then-candidate Trump impugned the integrity of a federal judge \npresiding over a lawsuit against one of his businesses because the judge is Hispanic. Trump \ncommented that Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s rulings against him “[H]as to do with perhaps that I’m \nvery, very strong on the border. . . Now, he is Hispanic, I believe. He is a very hostile judge to \nme.” See Ex. 40 (Jose A. DelReal and Katie Zezima, Trump’s personal, racially tinged attacks \non federal judge alarm legal experts, The Washington Post, June 1, 2016).   \n70.  In an interview with CBS News on June 5, 2016, then-candidate Trump again \nreiterated his anti-Mexican views, noting that “[Judge Curiel]’s a member of a club or society \nvery strongly, pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias.” See Ex. 41 (CBS News, \nTranscript of Face the Nation, June 5, 2016). Judge Curiel is a member of the San Diego Chapter \nof the La Raza Lawyers Association. See Ex. 42 (Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Trump supporters’ false \nclaim that Trump U judge is a member of a pro-immigrant group, The Washington Post, June 7, \n2016). \n71.  On August 21, 2015, two men urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then beat \nhim with a metal pole. They later told police that “Donald Trump was right; all these illegals \nneed to be deported.” When asked about the incident, then-candidate Trump failed to condemn \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 19 of 99 PageID #: 7750\nthe men, instead describing them as “passionate.” See Ex. 43 (Adrian Walker, ‘Passionate’ \nTrump fans behind homeless man’s beating?, The Boston Globe, Aug. 21, 2015). Specifically, \nTrump stated, “[i]t would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very \npassionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are \npassionate. Id. \n72.  In October 2016, during a presidential debate, then-candidate Trump responded to \na question about immigration by stating: “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to \nget them out.” See Ex. 44 (Katie Zezima, Trump on immigration: There are ‘bad hombres’ in the \nUnited States, The Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2017). \n73.  On January 27, 2017, newly-inaugurated President Trump and Mexico’s President \nPeña Nieto discussed President Trump’s proposal for a border wall over the phone. During that \ntranscribed conversation, President Trump again referred to “hombres” stating: “You have some \npretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you \nwith that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of \nknocking them out.” See Ex. 45 (Greg Miller et. al., Full Transcripts of Trump’s Calls with \nMexico and Australia, The Washington Post, Aug. 3, 2017).  \n74.  On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff \nJoe Arpaio, who was to be sentenced for criminal contempt for failing to comply with a federal \njudge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos. See Ex. 46 (Julie Hirschfield Davis and Maggie \nHaberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio, Who Became Face of Crackdown on Illegal \nImmigration, The N.Y. Times, Aug. 25, 2017).  \n75.  Sheriff Arpaio had been detaining people ostensibly because they had violated the \nlaw. But in practice, his office detained huge numbers of individuals solely because they looked \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 20 of 99 PageID #: 7751\nLatino, without any reasonable suspicion of illegal conduct. See generally Melendres v. Arpaio, \nFindings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:07-cv-02513-GMS, ECF Doc. No.579 (D. Az. May \n24, 2013). After a federal court enjoined that practice in 2011, Arpaio continued his unlawful and \ndiscriminatory practices unabated, “announc[ing] to the world and to his subordinates that he \nwas going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise.” United States v. Arpaio, \nFindings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:16-cr-01012-SRB, ECF Doc. No. 210 at 13 (D. Ariz. \nJuly 31, 2017). On July 31, 2017, a federal court held Arpaio in criminal contempt, holding that \nhe had willfully acted in “flagrant disregard” of the injunction. Id. \n76.  Before issuing the pardon, President Trump asked, “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for \ndoing his job?” See Ex. 46. (Davis and Haberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio). After issuing the \npardon, President Trump sent a tweet calling Mr. Arpaio “an American patriot.” Id. \n77.  As President Trump’s statements about Mexico and those with Mexican origins \ndemonstrate, the President is willing to disparage Mexicans in a misguided attempt to secure \nsupport from his constituency.   \nTrump Administration’s Threatening Statements about Deporting Immigrants. \n78.  On June 13, 2017, Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan testified in front of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, stating as to “every \nimmigrant in the country without papers,” that they “should be uncomfortable. You should look \nover your shoulder. And you need to be worried.” Hearing on the ICE and CBP F.Y. 2018 \nBudget Before the Subcomm. on Homeland Security of the H. Comm. on Appropriations, 115th \nCong. (2017) 2017 WLNR 18737622.  \n79.  On April 19, 2017, United States Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions stated in \nan interview on Fox News’ “Happening Now,” program—in response to a question regarding the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 21 of 99 PageID #: 7752\ndeportation of a DACA recipient—that “[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being \ndeported, so people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are \nnot subject to being deported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t promise people who are here \nunlawfully that they aren’t going to be deported.” Ex. 49 (Adam Shaw, Sessions defends \nimmigration policies after reported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News, Apr. 19, 2017).  \nPresident Trump Terminates DACA in Response to the Litigation Threats of a State Found \nto Have Discriminated Against Latinos/Hispanics Nine Times Since 2012. \n \n80.  On June 29, 2017, the Attorneys General of ten states, led by the State of Texas, \nsent U.S. Attorney General Sessions a letter threatening to add claims to litigation currently \npending in the Southern District of Texas “to challenge both the DACA program and the \nremaining expanded DACA permits,” if the Executive Branch did not agree to end the DACA \nprogram by September 5, 2017. Ex. 177 (Letter from Ken Paxton et.al. to Attorney General Jeff \nSessions, June 29, 2017). \n81.  The demand that President Trump eliminate DACA is part of a history of \nintentional discrimination against Latinos/Hispanics by the State of Texas. \n82.  Over the preceding decade, federal courts have repeatedly found the State of \nTexas liable for engaging in unlawful discrimination based on race and/or national origin. \n83.  For example, in Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133, 161 (D.D.C. 2012), \nthree federal judges blocked a Congressional and State House redistricting plan after finding that \nit “was enacted with discriminatory purpose.” \n84.  The litigation eventually culminated in a ruling by a three-judge panel on August \n15, 2017 finding, again, that the 2010 congressional districts had been created with “racially \ndiscriminatory intent” against Latinos and African American voters. Perez v. Abbott, SA-11-CV- \n360, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129982, at *55 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2017). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 22 of 99 PageID #: 7753\n85.  On October 9, 2014, in separate litigation challenging a state voter photo \nidentification (“ID”) law, a Texas federal district court judge found that the provision had been \n“imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and “constitute[d] an \nunconstitutional poll tax.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 633 (S.D. Tex. 2014). \n86.  On remand from the Fifth Circuit, a federal district court concluded that the 2011 \nLegislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters by requiring presentation of a \nphoto ID when casting their ballots. Veasey v. Abbott, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54253, at *14-18 \n(S.D. Tex. Apr. 10, 2017). \n87.  DHS issued the 2017 DHS Memorandum terminating DACA on September 5, \n2017, in direct response to the threats of the State of Texas and the other ten states, fulfilling the \ndemand of a State marked with a history of racial and national origin discrimination. \nPresident Trump Backtracks on His Promise and Terminates DACA.  \n88.  Attorney General Sessions announced the termination of DACA via a live press \nconference. He explained, without evidence, “The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, \namong other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that \nyielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.” See Ex. 75 (DOJ, Attorney \nGeneral Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA, Prepared Remarks, Sept. 5, 2017). \n89.  Under the 2017 DHS Memorandum, which accompanied this announcement, the \ngovernment’s new policy provides no discretion to approve new applications on a case-by-case \nbasis. Instead, the 2017 DHS Memorandum is a final decision that an entire class of people is no \nlonger eligible for deferred action, employment authorization, and other benefits. Per the 2017 \nDHS Memorandum, DHS “[w]ill reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 23 of 99 PageID #: 7754\nEmployment Authorization Documents filed after the date of this memorandum.” DHS will also \nreject all renewal applications it receives after October 5, 2017, and all renewal applications for \nauthorizations that expire after March 5, 2018. See Ex. 74 (DHS Memorandum). \n90.  In issuing the 2017 DHS Memorandum, the federal government misleadingly \nclaimed that DACA was unconstitutional, see Ex. 74, despite the fact that no court has made that \ndetermination, and despite previous determinations by DOJ and DHS, including under the Trump \nadministration, that DACA is lawful and should be left in place. In fact, as recently as June 15, \n2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly chose to allow DACA to continue (while \nterminating the DAPA program) “after consulting with the Attorney General.” See Ex. 23 \n91.  Even after the announcement, the government’s position on the reasoning for the \ntermination has been unclear and inconsistent. On the day of the termination, President Trump \nre-tweeted a statement that “We are a nation of laws. No longer will we incentivize illegal \nimmigration.” See Ex. 47 (Josh Saul, Jeff Sessions Always Wanted to Deport Undocumented \nImmigrant Youth. Now He Can, Newsweek, Sept. 5, 2017). The President appears to have \ndeleted this tweet. Later on September 5, the President tweeted, “Congress now has 6 months to \nlegalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can’t, I will \nrevisit this issue!” See Ex. 48 (Donald J. Trump, Twitter, Sept. 5, 2017). On September 14, 2017, \nhe tweeted, “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young \npeople who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really! .....” See Ex. 50 (Donald J. Trump, \nTwitter, Sept. 14, 2017). \n92.  As a result of the 2017 DHS Memorandum, DACA grantees whose benefits \nexpire after March 5, 2018 will immediately lose their employment authorization, as well as \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 24 of 99 PageID #: 7755\nother vital benefits, such as social security cards, driver’s licenses, financial aid, disability and \nhealth benefits, among others.  \n93.  They also may lose their homes and communities if the program is allowed to \nexpire. An internal White House memo reported on by CNN stated that DHS now is urging \nDACA grantees “to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States” when their \nDACA terms end. See Ex. 88 (Tal Kopan & Jim Acosta, Admin Memo: DACA recipients should \nprepare for departure from the United States, CNN, Sept. 5, 2017). This threat of deportation is \nconsistent with past references to deportation of DACA grantees, such as a statement by \nAttorney General Sessions in response to a question regarding the deportation of a DACA \ngrantee that “[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come \nhere and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not subject to being \ndeported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t promise people who are here unlawfully that they aren’t \ngoing to be deported.” See Ex. 49 (Adam Shaw, Sessions defends immigration policies after \nreported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News, Apr. 19, 2017).  \n94.  President Trump also has taken affirmative steps to reduce the privacy protections \napplicable to DACA grantee information. In January 2017, President Trump issued an Executive \nOrder directing all agencies, including DHS, to “ensure that their privacy policies exclude \npersons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of \nthe Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.” See Ex. 76 (Executive Order \n13768, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” Jan. 25, 2017). In response \nto the Executive Order, DHS adopted a privacy policy that “permits the sharing of information \nabout immigrants and non-immigrants with federal, state, and local law enforcement.” See Ex. \n51 (DHS, Privacy Policy 2017-01 Questions & Answers, Apr. 27, 2017). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 25 of 99 PageID #: 7756\n95.  The 2017 DHS Memorandum provides no assurance to DACA grantees, or \ndirection to USCIS and ICE, that information contained in DACA applications cannot be used \nfor the purpose of future immigration enforcement proceedings.  \n96.  To the contrary, on the same day that the 2017 DHS Memorandum was issued, \nDHS changed its public guidance about the use of DACA application data for immigration \nenforcement. DHS removed the webpage containing the assurance that, absent exceptional \ncircumstances, DACA application data “is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the \npurpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.” Cf. Ex. 25 (containing link to USCIS \nwebpage that now contains an error alert and a message stating, “The page you are looking for \nmay not exist or is temporarily unavailable.”). The same day, DHS posted a new policy \ngoverning the use of information provided by DACA applicants. DHS now states that USCIS \n“[g]enerally” will not “proactively provid[e] information obtained through DACA to ICE and \nCBP. See Ex. 89 (DHS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals, Sept. 5, 2017). The new policy imposes no restrictions on USCIS providing \nDACA data at the request of ICE, CBP, or any other law enforcement entity. Id. DHS also \nreserves the right to change its new policy “at any time without notice” and states that the policy \n“may not be relied upon” by any party. Id. \n97.  DACA grantees thus immediately face the risk that information they provided to \nthe federal government could be used against them at any time, without notice, for purposes of \nimmigration enforcement, including detention or removal. \nThe Defendants’ Failure to Notify Certain DACA Grantees of the October 5, 2017 Renewal \nDeadline.  \n \n98.  Before the termination of DACA, Defendants had a written policy and practice \nallowing DACA grantees to submit their renewal application up to one year after the date of \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 26 of 99 PageID #: 7757\nexpiration of their participation in DACA. If DACA grantees failed to renew within one year of \nthe expiration date, they had the option to re-apply as initial applicants. See Ex. 14 (USCIS \nFAQs – Q50). \n99.  In addition, USCIS and DHS had a long-standing practice of using the address \ninformation they maintain for DACA grantees to send individualized notices to those grantees \nregarding their renewal expiration dates. See Ex. 178 (DACA Renewal Notice).  \n100.  On information and belief, no standard renewal notices have been provided to \nDACA grantees whose participation in DACA expires between February 6, 2018 and March 5, \n2018. Prior to termination of DACA, a DACA grantee whose renewal status expires in February \n2018 would have received an individualized renewal notice informing the grantee that he or she \nhad to file a renewal 120-150 days prior to expiration, i.e., by November 2017, in order to avoid \na lapse in deferred action and employment authorization. See, e.g., id. However, since the \ntermination, Defendants have not yet sent this group of DACA grantees any notices regarding \nwhen and how they can renew.  \n101.  On information and belief, the government sent standard renewal notices up until \nAugust 1, 2017 for DACA grantees whose participation in DACA expires by January 2018, \ninforming the grantees they had the standard 120-150 days prior to the expiration date to renew if \nthey wished to “avoid a lapse in [their] period of deferred action and employment authorization”. \nSee, e.g., id. However, in light of DHS’s decision to impose an absolute cut-off date of October \n5, 2017 for all renewal applications, the information conveyed in these notices is now incorrect. \nThe notices misleadingly suggest to DACA grantees that they have several additional months \nbeyond October 5 to renew their DACA status without a gap in employment authorization. \nMoreover, the faulty renewal notices were not followed with individualized corrected notices \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 27 of 99 PageID #: 7758\ninforming this group of grantees that there is a new, absolute October 5 deadline for renewal, and \nthat DACA grantees will no longer have up to one year after the date of expiration of their \nDACA to submit a renewal application.  \n102.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to provide individualized notice regarding the \nnew October 5, 2017 renewal deadline to DACA grantees whose participation expires before \nMarch 5, 2018, individuals who received no notice or incorrect notice of the new deadline may \nbe forever ineligible to renew their participation in DACA. These DACA grantees will no longer \nbe protected from deportation and will lose work authorization that they may have otherwise \nhad. They may also lose health insurance, social security cards, driver’s licenses and other \nbenefits. \n103.  On October 3, 2017, DHS issued a press release stating that “[o]f the \napproximately 154,200 individuals whose DACA is set to expire between Sept. 5, 2017, and \nMarch 5, 2018, just over 106,000 either have renewal requests currently pending with USCIS, or \nhave already had USCIS adjudicate their renewal request.” See Ex. 82 (DHS Press Release \nDepartment of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke Reminds Eligible DACA \nRecipients to File Renewal Requests, October 3, 2017). Therefore, up to one third of DACA \ngrantees who are eligible for renewal had not applied as of two days before the October 5, 2017 \ndeadline.   \nThe Government’s Failure to Notify DACA Grantees of their Inability to Renew Their \nDACA Status If It Expires After March 5, 2018.  \n \n104.  On information and belief, Defendants’ termination of DACA was solely \ncommunicated to DACA grantees through the publication of DHS’s memorandum on September \n5, 2017 on the DHS website and by a concurrent television announcement from Attorney \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 28 of 99 PageID #: 7759\nGeneral Sessions. See Ex. 74 (DHS Memo); See Ex. 75 (Attorney General Sessions Delivers \nRemarks on DACA). \n105.   On information and belief, the government did not and does not plan to issue \nindividualized notices to any DACA grantees informing them of the termination of DACA and \ntheir inability to renew if their DACA status expires after March 5, 2018.  \n106.  Many DACA grantees relied upon their ability to apply to renew DACA in \nmaking important decisions related to their employment, education and families, among other \nthings. \nThe Government’s Failure to Comply with the Supreme Court’s Invalidation of the DACA \nRescission and Subsequent Vacatur of that Rescission.  \n \n107.  Ignoring the Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 Regents decision holding that \nDefendants’ 2017 rescission of DACA was arbitrary and capricious, 140 S. Ct. at 1915, and the \nsubsequent vacatur of the rescission by the Fourth Circuit on June 30, 2020, DHS failed to \nrecommence processing DACA applications.  Instead, it “generally held” applications “in \nanticipation of potential policy changes.”  Wolf Memo at 7. \nThe Wolf Memo Orders Interim Changes to DACA Pending DHS’s Consideration of Fully \nRescinding the DACA Program. \n \n108.  In the Wolf Memo, issued on July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf announced that “I \nam considering anew the DACA policy,” that “the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious \npolicy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,” and that, “in the exercise of my authority \nand discretion in establishing national immigration policies and priorities . . . I am rescinding the \nNielsen Memorandum and Duke Memorandum, and making certain immediate changes to the \nDACA policy to mitigate my enforcement policy concerns while I conduct a full and careful \nconsideration of the full rescission.”  Wolf Memo at 4. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 29 of 99 PageID #: 7760\n109.  Specifically, the Wolf Memo orders DHS to reject all new initial applications, to \nchange the renewal period for current beneficiaries from two years to one year, and to reject all \nadvance parole applications absent exceptional circumstances.  Id. at 7-8. \n110.  The Wolf Memo purports to apply these changes retroactively to all applications \nsubmitted after the Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 Regents decision.  Id. at 7. \n111.  On August 21, 2020, DHS Deputy Director of Policy Joseph Edlow issued a \nmemorandum purporting to implement the Wolf Memo, instructing USCIS officials to take the \nactions directed by the Wolf Memo.  Ex. 181. \nDefendant Wolf Lacked the Authority to Issue the Wolf Memo. \n \n112.  The U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) concluded that Defendant \nWolf has never lawfully served in the role of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security because his \nassumption of that role violated the FVRA and HSA. \n113.  Article II of the Constitution requires that the President obtain the “Advice and \nConsent” of the Senate for Cabinet officials. \n114.  The FVRA established a default framework for authorizing acting officials to fill \nSenate-confirmed roles, with three options for who may serve as an acting official.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 3345.  Under this framework, (1) the “first assistant to the office” of the vacant officer \ngenerally becomes the acting official, id. § 3345(a)(1), unless (2) the President appoints someone \nalready serving in a different Senate-confirmed position, id. § 3345(a)(2), or (3) the President \nauthorizes “an officer or employee” of the relevant agency to serve as the acting official if the \nofficer or employee has held a position in the agency above the GS-15 pay rate for 90 days or \nmore within the preceding year, id. § 3345(a)(3).  The FVRA further provides that a position \nmay be occupied by an acting official for a maximum of 210 days.  Id. § 3346.  This framework \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 30 of 99 PageID #: 7761\nis the “exclusive means” for authorizing acting officials unless a specific statute authorizes “the \nPresident, a court, or the head of an Executive department” to designate one.  Id. § 3347. \n115.  DHS has such a statute—the HSA—which establishes an order of succession for \nthe Acting Secretary, expressly superseding the FVRA’s default options.  6 U.S.C. § 113(g). \nFirst in line under the HSA is the Deputy Secretary, and then the Under Secretary for \nManagement. Id. §§ 113(a)(1)(A), 113(g)(1). After these two offices, the order of succession is \nset by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Id. § 113(g)(2). \n116.  Under the FVRA, official actions taken by unlawfully serving acting officials \n“shall have no force or effect” and “may not be ratified” after the fact, including acting officials \nthat assume their roles through agency-specific statutes like the HSA.  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), \n(2). \n117.  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was the most recent Senate-confirmed Secretary of \nHomeland Security. On February 15, 2019, she exercised her power under the HSA to set an \norder of succession for the position of Acting Secretary of DHS should the Deputy Secretary and \nUnder Secretary of Management positions be vacant. She did so by amending the existing order \nof succession that had been issued by then-Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2016—Delegation 00106.  \n118.  Nielsen’s February Delegation provided two grounds for accession of an Acting \nSecretary: (1) the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the \noffice; and (2) the Secretary’s unavailability to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency. \nEach ground set forth the order of succession that would govern under those circumstances. In \nthe case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of office, \nExecutive Order 13753—the most recent prior amendment to the order of succession in the \nDepartment—would govern the order of succession. If the Secretary were unavailable to act \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 31 of 99 PageID #: 7762\nduring a disaster or catastrophic emergency, the order of succession would be governed by \nAnnex A to the February Delegation. \n119.  At the time of the February Delegation, the orders of succession found in E.O. \n13753 and Annex A were identical; the first four positions in the order of succession for both \nwere as follows: (1) Deputy Secretary; (2) Under Secretary of Management, (3) Administrator of \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and (4) Director of the Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  The February Delegation further provided that officials \nwho were only acting in the listed positions (rather than appointed to those positions) were \nineligible to serve as Acting DHS Secretary, such that the position of Acting Secretary would \npass to the next Senate-confirmed official. \n120.  Nielsen originally announced her resignation from the Secretary position effective \nApril 7, 2019. Under the order of succession in effect at that time, and in view of the vacancy in \nthe Deputy Secretary position, the Acting Secretary position would have been assumed by Claire \nGrady, the Deputy Under Secretary for Management. See 6 U.S.C. §§ 113(a)(1)(A), 113(g)(1). \nBut Nielsen then purported to remain in office until April 10, and Grady resigned on April 9. \n121.  Before leaving office on April 10, 2019, Nielsen made a partial amendment to \nDHS’s order of succession. In this April Delegation, Nielsen retained the two separate grounds \nfor accession to the role of Acting Secretary: vacancies arising from Secretary’s death, \nresignation, or inability to perform the functions of office were still governed by E.O. 13753, and \nvacancies arising from the Secretary’s unavailability to act during a disaster or catastrophic \nemergency were still governed by Annex A to the Delegation. Nielsen also did not amend E.O. \n13753, which continued to govern the order of succession in the event of a vacancy created by \nthe Secretary’s death, resignation or inability to perform the functions of the office. Secretary \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 32 of 99 PageID #: 7763\nNielsen did, however, amend Annex A, which set forth the order of succession for when the \nSecretary is unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency; the new order of \nsuccession was as follows: (1) Deputy Secretary; (2) Under Secretary of Management; \n(3) Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and (4) Administrator of \nFEMA. \n122.  Senate-confirmed Commissioner of CBP Kevin McAleenan then assumed the role \nof Acting Secretary, supposedly pursuant to Annex A. Yet E.O. 13753 rather than Annex A \ngoverned the relevant order of succession because the vacancy in the position of Secretary was \ncreated by Nielsen’s resignation, not through the Secretary’s unavailability during a disaster or \ncatastrophic emergency.  \n123.  On November 8, 2019, McAleenen substituted Annex A for E.O. 13753 to govern \nthe order of succession when the Secretary dies, resigns, or is unable to perform the functions of \noffice. McAleenan then directed the order of succession in Annex A to be: (1) Deputy Secretary, \n(2) Under Secretary of Management; (3) Commissioner of CBP; and (4) Under Secretary for \nStrategy, Policy, and Plans. On November 13, 2019, McAleenan resigned as both Acting \nSecretary and Commissioner of CBP. Because the first three positions in the line of succession \nwere vacant, the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of Strategy, Policy, and Plans—Chad \nWolf—assumed the role of Acting Secretary. \n124.  On November 15, 2019, two days after Wolf assumed the Acting Secretary role, \nthe Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security and the Acting \nChairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote a letter to the head of \nGAO “to express serious concerns with the legality of the appointment” of Chad Wolf as Acting \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 33 of 99 PageID #: 7764\nSecretary of DHS and Ken Cuccinelli as Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy \nSecretary.  \n125.  In particular, the Chairman and Acting Chairwoman expressed concern that Wolf \nwas serving in violation of the FVRA and HSA because former Acting Secretary McAleenan did \nnot lawfully assume the Acting Secretary position, and so McAleenan had no authority to make \nthe changes to DHS’s order of succession that formed the basis for Wolf’s accession to Acting \nSecretary.  \n126.  On August 14, 2020, GAO issued a report responding to the Chairman and Acting \nChairwoman’s request, and assessing the legality of the appointment of Chad Wolf as Acting \nSecretary of DHS and Ken Cuccinelli as Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy \nSecretary. GAO, DHS-Legality of Service of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and Service \nof Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, File No. B-\n331650, Aug. 14, 2020.  \n127.  In the report, GAO explained that “[i]n the case of vacancy in the positions of \nSecretary, Deputy Secretary, and Under Secretary of Management, the HSA provides a means \nfor an official to assume the title of Acting Secretary pursuant to a designation of further order of \nsuccession by the Secretary.” Id. at 11. Based on the amendments Secretary Nielsen made to the \norder of succession in April 2019, GAO concluded that the Senate-confirmed CBP \nCommissioner (McAleenan) “would have been the appropriate official” to serve as Acting \nSecretary only if Secretary Nielsen had been “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \nemergency.” Id. at 7. \n128.  GAO concluded that because Secretary Nielsen had resigned, E.O. 13753 \ncontrolled under “the plain language of the April Delegation.” Id. GAO explained that after \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 34 of 99 PageID #: 7765\nNielsen’s resignation, then-Director of CISA, Christopher Krebs, should have assumed the \nposition Acting Secretary because he was the first Senate-confirmed official in the E.O. 13753 \norder of succession, which governed following a Secretary’s resignation.5 Id. at 8 & n.11. GAO \nnoted that although “McAleenan assumed the title of Acting Secretary upon the resignation of \nSecretary Nielsen,” “the express terms of the existing [succession] designation required [Krebs] \nto assume that title” and so “McAleenan did not have authority to amend the Secretary’s existing \ndesignation.” Id. at 11. GAO thus concluded that Wolf and Cuccinelli were improperly serving \nin their acting roles because they assumed those acting roles under “[the] invalid order of \nsuccession” established by McAleenan in November 2019. Id.  \n129.  GAO recognized that Secretary Nielsen’s conduct may have suggested that she \nintended McAleenan to become Acting Secretary upon her resignation, but GAO concluded that \n“it would be inappropriate, in light of the clear express directive of the April Delegation”—\nwhich provided that McAleenan would only take over if Nielsen was unavailable to act during a \ndisaster or catastrophic emergency—to interpret the order of succession based on post-hoc \nactions.” Id. at 9. GAO did not assess the consequences of Wolf’s and Cuccinelli’s unlawful \nappointments and instead referred that question to the DHS Office of Inspector General. Id. at \n11.  \n130.  Because Defendant Wolf unlawfully assumed the position of Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security in violation of the FVRA and HSA. Under the plain terms of the FVRA, all \nofficial actions taken by Wolf as Acting Secretary—including his issuance of the Wolf Memo—\nare therefore invalid.  \n                                                 \n5 The FEMA Administrator had resigned a week before Nielsen resigned.

As of March 31, 2020, USCIS reported that it had approved 738 initial DACA \napplications and 1,701 renewals for residents of the District.36  \n169.  Obtaining DACA status has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of the District, to work legally, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, \npurchase homes and cars, receive in-state tuition at public universities, and obtain employer-\nbased health insurance, among other benefits.   \n                                                 \n33 See CAP Demographic and Economic Impacts Report. \n34 See June 2020 MPI Estimates. \n35 See USCIS March 2020 Estimates.  \n36 See USCIS March 2020 Quarterly Report.  \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 44 of 99 PageID #: 7775\n170.  As of October 4, 2017, an estimated 707 District DACA grantees were employed. \nSee Ex. 5 ¶ 40 (Decl. Wong). An estimated 347 were in school, and 248 were pursuing a \nbachelor’s degree or higher. Id. ¶ 41. \n171.  An estimated 200 DACA recipients in the District are frontline workers in sectors \nthat are essential for the District’s COVID-19 response: health care, education, and food-related \njobs.37 \n172.  In addition to the many harms identified below, see ¶¶ 234-279, terminating \nDACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will hurt the District’s \neconomy generally. Stripping DACA grantees of the ability to work legally will cause many to \nlose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the State. According to one \nestimate, as of October 4, 2017, DACA-eligible residents contributed approximately $2.7 million \nannually in state and local taxes in the District—a contribution that was estimated to drop by \n$946,000 without DACA.

In addition to the many harms identified below, see ¶¶ 234-279, terminating \nDACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will hurt the North \nCarolina economy generally. Stripping DACA grantees of the ability to work legally will cause \nmany to lose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the State. \nAccording to one estimate, as of October 4, 2017, DACA-eligible residents contributed \napproximately $63.6 million annually in state and local taxes in North Carolina—a contribution \nthat was estimated to drop by $29 million without DACA.

Obtaining DACA status has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of Oregon, to work legally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, access \nlines of credit, purchase homes and cars, have more ready access to in-state tuition, and obtain \nemployer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n206.  As of October 4, 2017, an estimated 10,347 Oregon DACA grantees were \nemployed. See Ex. 5 ¶ 72 (Decl. Wong). An estimated 611 were business owners. Id. An \nestimated 5,083 were in school, and 3,634 were pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. Id. ¶ 73. \n207.  An estimated 4,800 DACA recipients in Oregon are frontline workers in sectors \nthat are essential for the State’s COVID-19 response: health care, education, and food-related \njobs.67 \n208.  The State of Oregon’s revenue structure relies heavily on income taxes, including \ncapital gains for investors, wages paid to workers, and corporate taxes that are directly linked to \nprofitability. See Ex. 126 ¶ 9 (Decl. Read).   \n209.  In addition to the many harms identified below, see ¶¶ 234-279, terminating \nDACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will hurt the Oregon \neconomy generally. Eliminating DACA grantee Oregonians’ ability to work legally will cause \nmany to lose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the state and \nimpairment of the state’s economic health. See, e.g., Ex. 100 ¶ 6 (Decl. Nicolas). According to \none estimate, as of October 4, 2017, DACA-eligible residents contributed approximately $20 \nmillion annually in state and local taxes in Oregon—a contribution that was estimated to drop by \n$11 million without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). Another 2017 estimate \npredicted that terminating DACA would, over a ten-year period, impact the Oregon economy \n                                                 \n67 See CAP COVID-19 Report. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 53 of 99 PageID #: 7784\nwith $384 million in budgetary costs and $1.3 billion in economic costs. See Ex. 4, Table 1 \n(Decl. Brannon). DACA recipients currently contribute an estimated $39.9 million annually in \nstate and local taxes in Oregon.68 \n210.  In addition, the inability to work legally and enjoy the other benefits of legal \nstatus such as better access to credit and the banking system will make it more difficult, if not \nimpossible, for DACA grantee Oregonians to start businesses that contribute to the State’s \neconomy and overall financial health. See Ex. 126 ¶ 12 (Decl. Read).  \n211.  In addition to the direct benefits to state programs of increased state revenues, the \nState is also an investor and a borrower. See Ex. 126 ¶¶ 5-9 (Decl. Read). The State’s credit \nrating, cost of borrowing, and the performance of the State’s investments are all tied to the \noverall economic health of the State. See Ex. 126 ¶ 9 (Decl. Read). A reduced state tax base, and \npotential downward pressure on corporate performance, has the potential to adversely affect \nthese interests as well. Many of the companies in which Oregon and Oregonians have holdings \nhave expressed concern that the rescission of the DACA program is a threat and will be \ndisruptive to their employees, their productivity, and their competitiveness. Any such disruption \nor downward pressure on corporate profits also potentially affects Oregon as a taxing entity and \na shareholder.   \nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA \n212.

The Rhode Island \nOffice of Management and Budget (“RIOMB”) estimates that the termination of DACA could \nlead to over $1 million in lost state and local income, real estate and vehicle taxes. See Ex. 128 ¶ \n3 (Decl. Womer, RIOMB). According to one estimate, as of October 4, 2017, DACA-eligible \nresidents contributed approximately $3.8 million annually in state and local taxes in Rhode \nIsland—a contribution that was predicted to drop by $1.2 million without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 \n(Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy \n(“ITEP”), the State of Rhode Island alone will lose $2.6 million in state and local taxes if DACA \nprotections are lost. See Ex. 54. (Misha Hill and Meg Wiehe, State and Local Contributions of \nYoung Undocumented Immigrants, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, April 25, 2017). \nAccording to the Center for American Progress, Rhode Island will lose over $61 million in \nannual GDP loss from removing DACA workers. See id. DACA recipients currently contribute \nan estimated $3.9 million annually in state and local taxes in Rhode Island.78 \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF VERMONT \n223.  As of October 4, 2017, the State of Vermont was home to an estimated 100 or \nmore DACA-eligible residents. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). Approximately 20 \nDACA recipients live in Vermont.79 \n224.  As of March 31, 2020, USCIS reported that it had approved 12 initial DACA \napplications and 55 renewals for residents of Vermont.80 \n                                                 \n78 See CAP Demographic and Economic Impacts Report. \n79 See USCIS March 2020 Estimates.  \n80 See USCIS March 2020 Quarterly Report.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 57 of 99 PageID #: 7788\n225.  Obtaining DACA status has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of Vermont, to work legally, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, purchase \nhomes and cars, and obtain employer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n226.  As of October 4, 2017, an estimated 37 DACA grantees were employed in \nVermont. See Ex. 53 (Nicole Prchal Svajlenka, et al., A New Threat to DACA Could Cost States \nBillions of Dollars, Center for American Progress, July, 21, 2017).  \n227.  In addition to the many harms identified below, see ¶¶ 234-279, terminating \nDACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will hurt the Vermont \neconomy generally. Stripping DACA grantees of the ability to work legally will cause many to \nlose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the State. According to one \nestimate, as of October 4, 2017, DACA-eligible residents contributed approximately $140,000 \nannually in state and local taxes in Vermont—a contribution that was estimated to drop by \n$48,000 without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). Another 2017 estimate \npredicted that terminating DACA would, over a ten-year period, cost the Vermont economy $2.4 \nmillion in Gross Domestic Product. See Ex. 53 (Prchal Svajlenka, et. al., A New Threat to \nDACA). \nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA \n228.  The Commonwealth of Virginia is home to an estimated 27,000 or more DACA-\neligible residents.81 Approximately 9,410 DACA recipients live in Virginia.82 \n229.  As of March 31, 2020, USCIS reported that it had approved 12,368 initial DACA \napplications and 27,411 renewals for residents of Virginia.83 \n                                                 \n81 See June 2020 MPI Estimates. \n82 See USCIS March 2020 Estimates.  \n83 See USCIS March 2020 Quarterly Report.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 58 of 99 PageID #: 7789\n230.  Obtaining DACA status has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of Virginia, to work legally, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, purchase \nhomes and cars, receive in-state tuition at public universities, and obtain employer-based health \ninsurance, among other benefits.   \n231.  As of October 4, 2017, an estimated 11,195 Virginia DACA grantees were \nemployed. See Ex. 5 ¶ 84 (Decl. Wong). An estimated 661 were business owners. Id. An \nestimated 5,499 were in school, and 3,932 currently were pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. \nId. ¶ 85. \n232.  An estimated 2,700 DACA recipients in Virginia are frontline workers in sectors \nthat are essential for the Commonwealth’s COVID-19 response: health care, education, and \nfood-related jobs.84 \n233.  In addition to the many harms identified below, see ¶¶ 234-279, terminating \nDACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will hurt the Virginia \neconomy generally. Stripping DACA grantees of the ability to work legally will cause many to \nlose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the State. As of October 4, \n2017, DACA-eligible residents contributed approximately $34.7 million annually in state and \nlocal taxes in Virginia—a contribution that was estimated to drop by $12.7 million without \nDACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). Another estimate suggests that terminating \nDACA would, over a ten-year period, impact the Virginia economy with $1 billion in budgetary \ncosts and $3.6 billion in economic costs. See Ex. 4, Table 1 (Decl. Brannon). DACA recipients \ncurrently contribute approximately $48.7 million annually in state and local taxes in Virginia.85 \n                                                 \n84 See CAP COVID-19 Report. \n85 See CAP Demographic and Economic Impacts Report. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 59 of 99 PageID #: 7790\nHARM TO PLAINTIFF STATES BY CATEGORY \nDiversity, Inclusion, and Constitutional Values. \n234.  The States have an interest in prohibiting the deprivation of life, liberty or \nproperty without due process, and in preventing any practice that denies equal protection of the \nlaws or otherwise discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin. For example: \na.  New York’s Constitution guarantees all persons the right to equal treatment under \nthe law and forbids discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion. N.Y. \nConst. art. I, § 11. And New York’s statutes reiterate the State’s strong interest in \ncombatting discrimination and prejudice. See N.Y. Exec. Law § 290. \nb.  Washington has declared that practices that discriminate against any of its \ninhabitants because of race, color, or national origin are matters of public concern \nthat threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public \nwelfare, health, and peace of the people. See Wash. Rev. Code 49.60.010. \nc.  Colorado welcomes people of all backgrounds. Colorado law prohibits unlawful \ndiscrimination against people based on, among other things, race, national origin, \nand ancestry. See C.R.S. § 24-34-601; C.R.S. § 24-34-402; C.R.S. § 24-34-502.  \nd.  The State of Connecticut has a strong public policy mandating inclusion, and state \nlaw forbids discrimination in education, employment, and public \naccommodations, and other public goods and rights based on race, national origin, \nand ancestry. See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 46a-60 (employment); 46a-64 (public \naccommodations); 10-15c (public education); 46a-75 (other educational and \nvocational programs). \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 60 of 99 PageID #: 7791\ne.  The Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1 et seq., establishes a public policy \n“to secure for all individuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination \nagainst any individual because of his or her … national origin.” See 775 ILCS \n5/1-102(A). It further establishes a public policy “to prevent discrimination based \non citizenship status in employment.” See 775 ILCS 5/1-102(C). \nf.  Delaware law broadly prohibits discrimination in multiple areas, including public \naccommodations, insurance, and employment. See Del. Code. Ann. tit. 6, § 4500-\n4516; Del. Code. Ann. tit. 18, § 2304(22); Del. Code. Ann. tit. 19, § 711. The \nDelaware Equal Accommodations Law “is intended to prevent, in places of public \naccommodations, practices of discrimination against any person” on numerous \nbases, including race, color, or national origin. See Del. Code. Ann. tit. 6, § 4501. \nThe law is to be “liberally construed to the end that the rights herein provided for \nall people. . . may be effectively safeguarded.” Id. \ng.  The Council of the District of Columbia enacted the District’s Human Rights Act \n“to secure an end in the District of Columbia to discrimination for any reason \nother than that of individual merit,” including discrimination based on national \norigin. See D.C. Code Ann. § 2-1401.01. The District’s Human Rights Act \nprohibits discrimination in a broad range of areas including employment, \neducation, places of public accommodation, public services, housing and \ncommercial space accommodations, the sale of motor vehicle insurance and the \nrental of motor vehicles.  \nh.  Through a long tradition of including and incorporating foreign-born persons into \nits institutions, businesses, and governments, New Mexico has become one of the \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 61 of 99 PageID #: 7792\nmost socially and politically diverse states. New Mexico enshrined in its state \nconstitution three provisions protecting the Spanish language and those who speak \nit. See N.M. Const. art. VII, § 3 (stating that “[t]he right of any citizen of the state \nto vote, hold office or sit upon juries shall never be restricted, abridged or \nimpaired on account of . . . language . . . or inability to speak, read or write the \nEnglish or Spanish languages except as otherwise provided in this constitution”); \nN.M. Const. art. XII, § 8 (requiring teachers to become proficient in English and \nSpanish); and N.M. Const. art. XII. § 10 (guaranteeing that “[c]hildren of Spanish \ndescent in the state of New Mexico shall never be denied the right and privilege \nof admission and attendance in the public schools or other public educational \ninstitutions of the state, and they shall never be classed in separate schools, but \nshall forever enjoy perfect equality with other children in all public schools and \neducational institutions of the state”). \ni.  Oregon has codified its state policy that practices of unlawful discrimination \nagainst any of its inhabitants because of religion or national origin are “a matter of \nstate concern,” and that such discrimination “menaces the institutions and \nfoundation of a free democratic state.” See ORS § 659A.006. \nj.  Pennsylvania’s laws reflect its commitment to values of diversity, \nmulticulturalism and openness to others of different races and nationalities. For \nexample, Pennsylvania’s Human Relations Act recognizes that an individual’s \nopportunity to obtain employment, public accommodation, housing \naccommodation and commercial property without discrimination on the basis of \n“race, color, familial status … ancestry [and] national origin” is a “civil right” that \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 62 of 99 PageID #: 7793\nis “enforceable” under Pennsylvania law. See 43 P.S. § 953. See also 43 P.S. \n§ 955. \nk.  In keeping with its history of freedom of conscience, equality and tolerance, \nRhode Island has prohibited practices that discriminate against any of its \ninhabitants because of race, color, or national origin. See R.I. Constitution Article \n1, section 2; R.I. Gen. Laws 12-19-38 (Hate Crimes Sentencing Act); R.I. Gen. \nLaws § 42-112-1 (The Civil Rights Act of 1990); R.I. Gen. Laws 28-5-1 (Fair \nEmployment Practices Act); R.I. Gen. Laws 34-37-1 (Fair Housing Practices \nAct).   \n235.  The States also have an interest in ensuring that their residents are not excluded \nfrom the benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and \nprivileges provided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \nHarm to States as Employers. \n236.  The States have an interest in maintaining qualified, trained workforces. \n237.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus will cause the States to lose qualified State employees. Many DACA recipients work in \ngovernment or at state-run institutions, and they were hired because of their specialized skills \nand qualifications. The States expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage DACA \nrecipients. If these individuals become ineligible to work, the States will lose the value of their \ninvestment and the services of employees who perform important functions for the States. They \nwill also incur the costs associated with the need to recruit, hire, and train replacements. See, \ne.g., Ex. 52 ¶ 8 (Decl. Mostofi, NYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs); Ex. 56 ¶¶ 2-4 (Decl. \nQuinonez); Ex. 70 ¶ 6 (Decl. I.V.); Ex. 61 ¶ 10 (Decl.

The States have an interest in the special contributions that DACA grantees make \nto State colleges and universities as students, employees, and alumni.  \n239.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus will harm the ability of the States’ colleges and universities, including public universities, \nto satisfy their educational missions and prepare the States’ residents for the workforce.

DACA has made it possible for many young people to attend colleges and \nuniversities in the States, as work authorization allows DACA grantees to work both while they \npursue their education and after graduation. More than 90 percent of DACA grantees report that \nDACA allowed them to pursue educational opportunities previously unavailable to them. See Ex. \n5 ¶ 18 (Decl. Wong).  For example: \na.  The University of Colorado estimates that there are over 200 DACA grantees \nenrolled across the University. Ex. 132 ¶ 5 (Decl. Allen). Colorado State \nUniversity has approximately 189 DACA grantees. Ex. 131 ¶ 8 (Decl. Miranda).   \nb.  Connecticut’s state and private colleges and universities welcome DACA \ngrantees. To cite just one instances: Eastern Connecticut State University is home \nto 205 DACA recipient from across the country, as part of a scholarship program \nthat enables undocumented students from “locked out” states, or states that do not \nallow undocumented students to attend public college, to pursue a college \neducation.86 \n                                                 \n86See Press Release, Eastern Hosts Press Conference in Support of DACA (Nov. 13, 2019), \nhttps://www.easternct.edu/news/_stories-and-releases/2019/11-november/eastern-hosts-press-conference-in-support-\nof-daca.html. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 65 of 99 PageID #: 7796\nc.  Delaware Technical and Community College (“DTCC”) has at least 148 DACA \nstudents and at least another 242 graduates who are DACA grantees. See Ex. 135 \n¶ 5 (Decl. Rakes). Many of DTCC’s DACA students are nontraditional learners \nwho support their families in addition to pursuing their education. Id. ¶ 8. Another \napproximate 75 DACA grantees currently attend Delaware State University \n(“DSU”). See Ex. 66 (Scott Gross, DSU immigrant students fear Trump’s DACA \ndecision, Delawareonline, Sept. 2, 2017). During the 2019-2020 school year, there \nwere about 150 DACA grantees enrolled at DSU.87  \nd.  As of September 2017, there were 16 students who had reported their DACA \nstatus to the University of Hawaii and who were pursuing various degrees at \nmultiple University campuses. Ex. 137 ¶ 6 (Decl. Straney). As of Spring 2020, the \nUniversity of Hawaii had 17 DACA students. \ne.  In the University of Illinois System, approximately 350 of its students and 100 of \nits employees would be affected by the termination of DACA. Ex. 143 ¶ 8 (Decl. \nWilson, Univ. of Illinois System). \nf.  In New York, both the State University of New York (“SUNY”) and the City \nUniversity of New York (“CUNY”) have encouraged DACA grantees to apply as \npart of their strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. See Ex. 12 ¶ \n10 (Decl. Milliken, CUNY); Ex. 99 (Decl. Johnson, SUNY). At CUNY, hundreds \nof DACA grantees have enrolled in the university, many with the benefit of full \nscholarships.

If the DACA program is terminated or not restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus, talented young immigrants will be less likely to apply to and attend State schools because \nthey will not be able to afford tuition given the loss of available financial assistance (in some of \nthe States) and the likelihood that they will not be able to work legally upon graduation (in all the \nStates). Those already enrolled will be less likely to finish their education at State schools due to \nthe loss of current and future earning potential. See Ex. 12 ¶ 7-8 (Decl. Milliken); Ex. 56 ¶ 7 \n(Decl.

Additionally, DACA students enrolled in programs that require employment \nauthorization or entail licensing requirements to complete elements of the program—such as paid \ninternships, clinical placement, residency training, or programs that require significant lab or \nfield work—will be severely and adversely impacted if DACA is terminated or not restored to its \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 69 of 99 PageID #: 7800\npre-September 5, 2017 status. Indeed, these students may not be able to complete the academic \nrequirements of their degrees. See, e.g., Ex. 12 ¶ 8 (Decl. Milliken); Ex. 61 ¶ 6 (Decl. Heatwole); \nEx. 135 ¶ 9 (Decl.

Mathewson & Pareja); Ex. 145 ¶ 9 (Decl. Kennedy); Ex 6 ¶¶ 13-15 (Decl. C. Andrade).  \n244.  DACA students in graduate programs at public universities in the States will be \nsignificantly affected by the termination of the DACA program or failure to restore it to its pre-\nSeptember 5, 2017 status because the loss of employment authorization needed for graduate \nassistantship (research or teaching) will likely mean the loss of tuition waivers and other benefits \nsuch as subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance for the students and their families. The \nloss of graduate assistants also is a significant harm to the States because of the services they \nprovide in assisting faculty and instructing students. See Ex. 61 ¶ 5 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ \n31-32 (Decl. Herbst). \n245.  Losing these talented young immigrants will deprive the States’ schools of the \nspecial and unique contributions and perspectives they bring to campus communities, both as \nstudents and alumni. See, e.g., Ex. 57 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. Ballinger); Ex. 58 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Loera); Ex. \n61 ¶ 7 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 132 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Allen);  Ex. 131 ¶ 9 (Decl. Miranda); Ex. 134 ¶¶ \n19-26, 36-38 (Decl.

The States’ public universities and colleges will also suffer direct financial harm, \nincluding lost tuition revenue and scholarship funds, if DACA students are forced to withdraw or \nare unable to enroll. See, e.g., Ex. 57 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. Ballinger); Ex. 58 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Loera,); Ex. \n61 ¶ 7 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 27-28 (Decl. Herbst); Ex. 133 ¶¶ 17-18 (Decl. Pachis); Ex. \n136 ¶ 8 (Decl.

Miranda); Ex. 145 ¶¶ 10-14 (Decl. Kennedy). In at least one state (Oregon), current \ndemographic and enrollment trends and other factors suggest that this lost revenue will not be \nreplaced by other students for many universities, and will represent an absolute loss of revenue. \nSee Ex. 160 ¶ 8 (Decl. Hagemann); Ex. 158 ¶ 7 (Decl. Trueblood-Gamble); Ex. 157 ¶ 7 (Decl. \nRidder). \n247.  The termination of DACA or failure to return DACA to its-pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus also will impose additional tangible costs on our public colleges and universities, which \nalready have experienced disruption as a result of uncertainty over the future of the program and \nare preparing for the likelihood of expending additional resources to address the detrimental \neffects of DACA termination. See, e.g., Ex. 61 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 35, 38 (Decl. \nHerbst); Ex. 136 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Hardwick); Ex. 157 ¶ 12 (Decl. Ridder); Ex. 155 ¶ 7 (Decl. \nAlexander); Ex. 153 ¶ 11 (Decl.

The termination of DACA or failure to return DACA to its-pre-September 5, 2017 \nstatus will further deprive the States of the earning potential of graduates from public colleges \nand universities who are most likely to stay in-State and join the States’ workforces. See, e.g., \nEx. 132 ¶ 9 (Decl. Allen). For example: \na.  Nine out of ten Massachusetts public higher education graduates remain in the \nState, working or pursuing further education. See Ex. 93 (Mass. Dept. of Higher \nEducation, Time to Lead, The Need for Excellence in Public Higher Education, \nSept. 2012).   \nb.  The majority of Iowa public higher education graduates remain in Iowa, working \nor pursuing further education. See Ex. 67 at 26 (The University of Iowa \nPomerantz Career Center, 2015-2016 Annual Report); Ex. 68 (Iowa State \nUniversity 6-Month Post Graduation Status, 2014-2015; Ex. 73 at 2 (Career \nReady, University of Northern Iowa Career Services, 2016).  \nc.  Nearly 90 percent of Community College of Rhode Island graduates stay in \nRhode Island after graduation to live and raise their families. Ex. 162 (Hughes \nLetter). \nd.  About 75 percent of Connecticut’s public college and university graduates stay in \nConnecticut to begin their careers.88 At Eastern Connecticut State University, \nwhich hosts a nationwide scholarship program for DACA grantees, the in-state \nretention rate is even higher: Approximately 85 to 87 percent of Eastern \nConnecticut State University graduates stay in Connecticut after graduation to \n                                                 \n88 See Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Why College Graduates Choose Connecticut (Jan. 29, 2020), \nhttps://www.cbia.com/news/economy/why-college-graduates-choose-connecticut/.  \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 72 of 99 PageID #: 7803\n“contribute[] to the growth and vitality of Connecticut’s economy.” Ex. 133 ¶ 16 \n(Decl. Pachis). \n249.  Terminating DACA will also undermine the investment in and efforts to develop \na well-educated workforce that can contribute to the States’ overall economies and \ncompetitiveness, and the States’ ability to meet certain critical workforce needs such as \nhealthcare in rural areas. See, e.g., Ex. 159 ¶ 6 (Decl. Galvan); Ex. 154 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Decl. Cuprill-\nComas); Ex. 156 ¶ 11 (Decl. Mitsui). As of October 4, 2017, 100 DACA grantees are medical \nstudents and medical resident physicians at schools that are members of the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, and approximately two-thirds of these DACA grantees are pursuing \ntheir medical education in one of the States. See Ex. 114 ¶ 4 (Decl. Prescott, Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges). Aspiring DACA-grantee physicians contribute to a diverse and \nculturally responsive workforce to meet the needs of underserved populations. See id. ¶¶ 5-6. \nTerminating DACA or failing to to return DACA to its-pre-September 5, 2017 status will cause \nthe States to lose specific investments that they have made in this workforce and will leave \nsignificant gaps in the States’ healthcare workforce. See id. ¶ 7; Ex. 85 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Swenson). \nFor example: \na.  In Illinois, DACA grantees have participated in a loan program, through the \nIllinois Finance Authority, in which students receive interest-free loans so long as \nthey agree to repay the principal and commit to four years of work in an \nunderserved Illinois community following their graduation. Ex. 141 ¶ 6 (Decl. \nPelissero & Callahan, Loyola Univ. of Chicago). Without DACA, underserved \nIllinois communities will lose access to these committed medical professionals. \nId. ¶ 8. \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 73 of 99 PageID #: 7804\nb.  Oregon’s legislature has established a program to provide scholarships to health \nprofessional students who commit to practicing in rural and underserved areas of \nthe state for a period of time following graduation. See ORS 348.303.  \n250.  The nation’s leading private universities will suffer harms if DACA is terminated \nor not restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 status. As of October 4, 2017, for example, Harvard \nUniversity had more than 50 DACA students enrolled. See Ex. 96 ¶ 6 (Decl. Madsen, Harvard \nUniv.). Tufts University had more than 25 DACA students as of that date. See Ex. 97 ¶ 8 (Decl. \nJeka, Tufts Univ.). Brown University had approximately 12 DACA students as of that date. See \nEx. 161 (Locke Letter). Roger Williams University, home to Rhode Island’s only law school, \nhad at least six DACA students as of that date. See Ex. 164 ¶ 6 (Decl. Farish). These students \noften have had to overcome significant challenges in order to gain acceptance and bring critical \nperspectives, insights, and experiences to their universities. They make important and lasting \ncontributions, including through their classroom participation, their extracurricular engagements, \nand their commitment to independent study and research. See, e.g., Ex. 97 ¶ 5 (Decl. Jeka); Ex. \n96 ¶¶ 5, 7, 12 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. 144 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Martin, Amherst College); Ex. 147 ¶ 7 \n(Decl. Stephens, Mount Holyoke College); Ex. 140 ¶¶ 4, 6, 9 (Decl. Jensen, Illinois Wesleyan \nUniv.); Ex. 141 ¶¶ 4, 5, 6, 7,8 (Decl. Pelissero & Callahan); Ex. 138 ¶¶ 6, 11 (Decl. Salgado, \nCity Colleges of Chicago); Ex. 164 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Farish); Ex. 161 (Locke Letter). \n251.  Employment authorization gives these students and their universities an assurance \nthat they may put their talents to use in the United States job market after graduation, benefitting \nthe States and the nation as a whole. See, e.g., Ex. 96 ¶¶ 12-15 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. 161 (Locke \nLetter); Ex. 144 ¶ 9 (Decl. Martin, Amherst); Ex. 147 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Stephens). The New Mexico \nlegislature in January 2020 passed amendments to permit professional licensure eligibility \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 74 of 99 PageID #: 7805\nwithout regard to citizenship status or lawful presence, SB 137, signed March 6, 2020, a measure \ndirectly benefitting DACA students. Two of the most effective spokeswomen for the \namendments to professional licensure laws were then students themselves—one, a law student \nnow graduated and serving immigrants seeking citizenship status; the other, a medical student \nnow in surgical rotations, whose intent is to serve the immigrant community in public health \nsettings. \n252.  DACA has allowed these students to step outside the shadow of their immigration \nstatus and to participate fully as members of academic and campus communities in ways that \nlikely would not be possible otherwise. See, e.g., Ex. 140 ¶¶ 7, 8 (Decl. Jensen); Ex. 97 ¶ 7 \n(Decl. Jeka); Ex. 96 ¶ 12 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. ¶ 7 (Decl. Martin, Amherst). Terminating DACA \nor failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will take important opportunities away \nfrom DACA students and reintroduce fear and uncertainty into their lives, with significant \nadverse effects on these students, their universities, and the broader community. See Ex. 140 ¶¶ \n7, 8 (Decl. Jensen); Ex. 97 ¶¶ 8-10 (Decl. Jeka); Ex. 96 ¶ 13 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. 144 ¶ 10 (Decl. \nMartin, Amherst); Ex. 148 ¶ 6 (Decl. Martin, Northeastern Univ.); Ex. 147 ¶ 10 (Decl. \nStephens); Ex. 161 (Locke Letter); Ex. 103 ¶ 8 (Decl. Perla); Ex. 106 ¶ 7 (Decl. Suria); Ex. 105 ¶ \n5 (Decl. Oduyoye); Ex. 104 ¶ 7 (Decl. G.L.); Ex. 102 ¶¶ 12-14 (Decl. Juarez); Ex. 152 ¶ 19 \n(Decl. Mathewson & Pareja); Ex. 151 ¶¶ 14, 16 (Decl. Roth, UNMHSC); Ex. 107 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. \nTorrez). \nHarm to State Law, Regulation, and Policy. \n253.  The States have an interest in preserving their legal, regulatory, and policy \nframeworks that take the DACA program into account. \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 75 of 99 PageID #: 7806\n254.  Many of the States have enacted laws, promulgated regulations, and/or \nestablished policies that contemplate and rely on the DACA program. If DACA is terminated or \nnot restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 status, these legal, regulatory, and policy regimes will \nbe harmed. For example: \na.  Since 2012, Connecticut has granted driver’s licenses to approximately 5,000 \nDACA grantees who are Connecticut residents, many of whom have also \npurchased and registered vehicles in Connecticut. See Ex. 121 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. \nBzdyra). DACA grantees who have purchased and registered vehicles will have \npaid Connecticut sales tax and local property taxes for such vehicles. Id. ¶¶ 8-9.      \nb.  Illinois has enacted laws to enable DACA grantees to participate in the economy \nprofessionally. These include providing that no person in Illinois shall be \nprohibited from receiving a law license solely because he or she is not a citizen \nand explicitly allowing DACA grantees to apply for a license to practice law. See \n705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/2. DACA grantees are also eligible to receive state-issued \nidentification cards and drivers’ licenses; own motor vehicles which are \nregistered, titled and licensed in the state of Illinois; and own businesses and \nproperty in Illinois. See Ex. 125 ¶ 6 (Decl. White, Illinois Secretary of State). The \nOffice of the Illinois Secretary of State will be adversely impacted if DACA is \nterminated by the loss of revenue from licensing fees and taxes, as well as costs \nand system disruptions related to eligibility determinations of license renewals for \nDACA recipients. Id. ¶ 7. Illinois administrative rules, regulations and laws will \nalso need to be amended to conform to the changes in the DACA program. Id. \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 76 of 99 PageID #: 7807\nc.  Under DACA, thousands of young Massachusetts and Oregon residents are able \nto receive social security cards and thereby have access to driver’s licenses, which \nthey depend on to attend heath care appointments, to commute to work and \nschool, and to attend to other necessities for themselves and their family \nmembers. See Ex. 9 (Mass. Registry of Motor Vehicles, Social Security Number \n(SSN) Requirements); ORS 807.021 (proof of legal presence required to issue, \nrenew or replace driver license); Ex. 175  (Attorney General Advisory Letter to \nActing Commissioner J. Eric Boyette, Jan.17, 2013); Ex. 101 ¶ 3 (Decl. \nPreciado); Ex. 71 ¶¶ 5-7, 9 (Decl. I.T.); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 70 ¶¶ \n5, 8 (Decl. I.V.). Terminating DACA will make it impossible for these individuals \nto apply for new licenses or renew the licenses they have, leading to a number of \nadverse outcomes, including a decrease in licensing fees paid to the States, a \ndecrease in productivity of these residents, and an increase in unlicensed drivers \non the road.   \nHarm to Public Health and Health Care Costs. \n255.  The States have an interest in protecting the public health and in minimizing \nhealth care costs expended by the States.  \n256.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nharm public health and impose additional health care costs on the States. Work authorization \nallows DACA grantees to access employer-sponsored health benefits. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 4 (Decl. \nTeodoro); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 171 ¶18 (Decl. Park); Ex. 172 ¶8 (Decl. Morales); \nEx. 110 ¶ 8 (Decl. Schlosberg, District of Columbia Department of Health Care Finance). In fact, \nmore than 50% of DACA grantees have obtained employer-provided insurance. See Ex. 5 ¶ 12 \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 77 of 99 PageID #: 7808\n(Decl. Wong). Without these benefits, more of the States’ residents are likely to forgo needed \nhealth care, including preventive care, which will create more costly health problems in the long \nrun. It also will cause more people to rely on state-funded and/or state-administered public health \ncare and other benefits and thus impose additional costs on the States. For example: \na.  Colorado provides emergency Medicaid regardless of immigration status, which \ncovers the hospital delivery of children for qualified undocumented immigrants. \nSee Ex. 78 at 1-2 (Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing \nletter dated June 28, 2005). \nb.  Delaware provides limited emergency and labor/delivery services to residents \nwhose immigration status otherwise keeps them from accessing health care \nbenefits and services. See Ex. 122 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Groff).  \nc.  The D.C. HealthCare Alliance is the District of Columbia’s state-sponsored \ninsurance program of last resort. See Ex. 110 ¶¶ 6, 9 (Decl. Schlosberg); see also \nD.C. Code § 7-771.07(2). The placement of all of the individuals in the District \nparticipating in the DACA program in 2017 onto the D.C. HealthCare Alliance \nwould require the District to spend additional money on that program, harm \nDistrict finances, and prevent the District from spending that money on other \npublic health priorities. See Ex. 110 ¶ 10 (Decl. Schlosberg). In fact, the \nplacement of these individuals onto the D.C. HealthCare Alliance could cost the \nDistrict an additional $283,000 per month in District of Columbia Fiscal Year \n2018. See id. ¶ 12. \nd.  Under Hawaii’s Prepaid Health Care Act, Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 393, Hawaii \nemployers are required to provide regular employees who meet wage \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 78 of 99 PageID #: 7809\nrequirements with coverage under a qualifying prepaid group health care plan. See \nHaw. Rev. Stat. § 393-11. The termination of DACA will likely cause more \npeople to rely on Hawaii’s state-administered Medicaid One-Time Emergency \nservices. Hawaii reimburses hospitals for emergency and urgent services provided \nto qualifying uninsured Hawaii patients, including undocumented immigrants. Ex. \n123 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Peterson, Med-QUEST Division, Hawaii Department of Human \nServices).   \ne.  In Massachusetts, DACA grantees who lose employer-based coverage may be \neligible for MassHealth, a state-funded health insurance program. See Ex. 83 ¶¶ 5-\n7 (Decl. Caplan, Mass. Executive Office of Health and Human Services). In \naddition, Massachusetts will very likely have to cover some, if not all, of the costs \nof health care visits for these individuals through its state-administered Health \nSafety Net program or other programs. Id. ¶¶ 8-9. Finally, some DACA grantees \nwho lose employer-based coverage will likely use providers, like community-\nbased health centers, that are funded in part by grants and other funding streams \navailable through the state. Id. ¶¶ 10-14.  \n257.  The State of New York currently funds Medicaid coverage for low-income \nundocumented immigrants who have received deferred action, including DACA-eligible \nimmigrants. See Ex. 77 (Office of Health Insurance Program, Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) Expanded Coverage for Certain Qualified and \nPRUCOL Aliens, May 7, 2013). Terminating DACA may reduce access to Medicaid for current \nDACA grantees. The State of New York currently funds Medicaid coverage for low-income \nundocumented immigrants who have received deferred action, including DACA-eligible \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 79 of 99 PageID #: 7810\nimmigrants. See Id. Individuals in New York who are not DACA grantees may only qualify for \nMedicaid coverage of care and services necessary to treat an emergency condition. Terminating \nDACA will require New York to either seek a State legislative change to maintain current \nMedicaid coverage formerly DACA-eligible immigrants with state dollars only or limit Medicaid \ncoverage to treatment of emergency conditions for some or all of these individuals. \nHarm to Small Cities, Counties, and Towns. \n258.  The States have an interest in preventing economic and other harm to their small \ncities, towns, counties, and other small governmental jurisdictions. \n259.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nharm small governmental jurisdictions in the States. If DACA is terminated, small governmental \njurisdictions will lose talented and trained employees, adversely affecting operations and costing \ntime, money, and effort to replace and retrain these employees. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶¶ 10-11 (Decl. \nAmbrosino & Bourque, City of Chelsea, MA and Chelsea Public Schools); Ex. 113 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. \nSchuh). Many of these employees are highly skilled workers, including in critical fields such as \nnursing. See, e.g., Ex. 135 ¶¶ 10, 13 (Decl. Rakes); Ex. 98 ¶ 7, 10-11 (Naveed). \n260.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nhave a direct, adverse effect on economies and sales tax revenues of small cities and towns, as \nDACA grantees will lose their jobs and refrain from buying goods and services from local \nvendors. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶ 16 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 176 ¶¶ 8-10, 13 (Decl. \nKennedy, City of Newburgh).  \n261.  DACA grantees average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers \nand are able to better participate in the States’ economies, for example by purchasing homes and \ncars that are taxed by our state and local authorities. See Ex. 5 ¶ 16 (Decl. Wong). If DACA is \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 80 of 99 PageID #: 7811\nterminated or not restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 status, cities and towns will lose other \nlocal tax revenue, including real estate taxes and motor vehicle excise taxes, from DACA \ngrantees who can no longer access lines of credit or afford to buy cars or homes.  \n262.  If DACA is terminated or not restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 status, small \ngovernmental jurisdictions will lose the benefits that full access by and participation of a diverse \ncommunity fosters through community activities, including, for example, activities in libraries \nand local government-sponsored recreational camps or sports leagues. See, e.g, Ex. 109 ¶¶ 5-6 \n(Decl. Meyer, New Castle County, Del.). The termination of DACA or failure to restore it to its \npre-September 5, 2017 status will also have a destructive effect on local industries of small \ngovernmental jurisdictions that rely on the work of highly qualified and trained DACA \nrecipients. Ex. 176 ¶¶ 4, 8-10, 13 (Decl. Kennedy, City of Newburgh).   \n263.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nalso adversely affect public safety, health, and wellbeing in the States’ cities, towns, and schools. \nWithout DACA status, DACA grantees afraid of deportation will be less likely to report \nviolence, abuse, crimes or other harms to the community. If DACA is terminated or not restored \nto its pre-September 5, 2017 status, 53% of current DACA grantees may be less likely to report a \ncrime they witnessed; 47% may be less likely to report a crime even if they were the victim; 48% \nmay be less likely to go to the hospital if they suffered an injury, and 60% may be less likely to \nreport wage theft by their employer. See Ex. 5 ¶ 24 (Decl. Wong). This will make it harder for \nlocal police and other officials to provide for the public safety and welfare. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶ \n15 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 108 ¶¶ 7-10 (Decl. Hughes); Ex. 109 ¶ 6 (Decl. Meyer); \nEx. 116 ¶¶ 10-13 (Decl. Graham, Delaware Community Legal Aid Society, Inc.). For example, \nsince the Trump Administration announced plans to end DACA, Delaware law enforcement and \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 81 of 99 PageID #: 7812\nlegal aid have recognized an increased reluctance among Delaware immigrants to engage with \naspects of the criminal justice system—even when that interaction would have been to protect \ntheir own victim rights. See, e.g., Ex. 108 ¶¶ 7-10 (Decl. Hughes); Ex. 116 ¶¶ 10-13 (Decl. \nGraham). \nHarm to School Districts, Including Small School Districts. \n264.  The States have an interest in effectively educating elementary and secondary \nstudents and in preventing economic harm to small and large school districts.  \n265.  If DACA is terminated or not restored to its pre-September 5, 2017 status, public \nschool districts will suffer financial harm as well as harm to their educational missions. \n266.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \ncause school districts to lose talented and experienced teachers and other staff members who are \nDACA grantees, adversely affecting student education and costing time, money, and effort to \nreplace and retrain these employees. See Ex. 111 ¶ 11 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 79 \n(Whaley, Denver Public Schools say ending DACA would have “catastrophic” effect, Denver \nPost, Aug. 31, 2017).  \n267.  In Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York, \nTeach for America has placed teachers who are DACA grantees in shortage-area subjects and \nhard-to-staff schools in low-income communities. See Ex. 11 ¶¶ 3, 11 (Decl. Carrizales, Teach \nFor America). Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nnot only deprive schools of their employees, but also deprive students of teachers whose live \nexperiences may mirror their own lives. Id. ¶¶ 10, 11. \n268.  Public elementary and secondary schools have a constitutional obligation to \neducate students irrespective of immigration status. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). The \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 82 of 99 PageID #: 7813\ntermination of DACA or failure to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will harm the \nStates’ ability to educate DACA-eligible students as required by federal law. See Ex. 111 ¶¶ \n12,14 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 112 ¶ 3-4 (Decl. Kanninen, Arlington, VA Public \nSchools).  \n269.  If DACA-eligible students are no longer able to work legally after high school or \ncannot afford to go to college, these students will be less motivated to achieve in school. See Ex. \n111 ¶ 12 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 112 ¶ 3 (Decl. Kanninen). This will result in lower \nscores and higher dropout rates for these students. See Ex. 111 ¶ 12 (Decl. Ambrosino & \nBourque).  \n270.  Poorer performance will impact school districts’ accountability ratings and could \nrequire removal of administrators and teachers as well as increased state funding to flow to these \nschool districts. See, e.g., Ex. 179 (Mass. Dep’t of Early and Secondary Educ., School Leader’s \nGuide to the 2017 Accountability Determinations, Sept. 2017). Decreased school performance \nwill also negatively impact the community, with families not wanting to buy homes in a lower-\nperforming district. See Ex. 111 ¶ 13 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque).  \n271.  Finally, DACA-eligible students will experience higher levels of anxiety about \ntheir futures and their families’ futures, and will require additional counseling and support from \nguidance counselors and other school personnel, costing school districts time and money. See Ex. \n111 ¶ 14 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque). \nHarm to Businesses and Nonprofits. \n272.  The States have an interest in their tax revenues, economies, and the financial \nwell-being of their businesses and nonprofits. \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 83 of 99 PageID #: 7814\n273.  Immigration is an important economic driver in the States. Many of the States’ \nworkers are immigrants, and many of those immigrant workers are DACA grantees. See, e.g., \nEx. 5  ¶ ¶  28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88 (Decl. Wong); Ex. 126 ¶ \n11 (Decl. Read, Oregon State Treasurer); Ex. 95 ¶ 7 (Decl. Solano); Ex. 101 ¶ 4 (Decl. \nPreciado); Ex. 100 ¶ 6 (Decl. Nicolas); Ex. 124 ¶¶ 4, 10-11 (Decl. Salaveria); Ex. 168 ¶ 3 (Decl. \nCabrera); Ex. 120 ¶ 4 (Decl. Romero, Barrera Legal Group, PLLC); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 4,6,8 (Decl. \nWylde, Partnership for NYC); Ex. 81 ¶¶ 2-3, 5-6 (Decl. Pinsky, ABNY). Many companies in the \nStates are dependent on DACA grantees to operate and grow their businesses. The market for \nhighly skilled workers and employees is extremely competitive. Terminating DACA grantees’ \nwork authorization will inhibit the States’ companies’ ability to adequately staff their \norganizations, develop their workforces, recruit talent, and maintain trained employees. The \nCenter for American Progress estimates that it costs businesses roughly one-fifth of a worker’s \nsalary to replace a worker due to productivity loss, the cost of hiring and training a new \nemployee, and ramp-up periods for new employees. See Ex. 80 (Heather Boushey and Sarah \nJane Glynn, There Are Significant Business Costs to Replacing Employees, Center for American \nProgress, November 16, 2012). \n274.  If companies lose employees and recruiting efforts are less successful, their ability \nto develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. See e.g., Ex. \n63 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Blackwell-Hawkins, Amazon); Ex. 90 ¶¶ 7-12, 14 (Decl. Shively, Microsoft); \nEx. 8 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mutty, Starbucks); Ex. 84 ¶¶ 4-11 (Decl. Kalvert, TripAdvisor); Ex. 119 ¶¶ \n5-6 (Decl. Tingen, Tingen & Williams, PLLC); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 5-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for \nNYC). For example: \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 84 of 99 PageID #: 7815\na.  Colorado’s talented workforce has attracted major industries to the State, \nincluding aerospace, high-tech, start-ups, and STEM-based employers. Many \ncompanies in Colorado rely heavily on immigrants to operate their business. \nTerminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \ndisrupt these companies with DACA employees that are forced to terminate \nqualified and talented employees. \nb.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nkneecap Connecticut’s technology-driven economy, which dependent on \nimmigrant workers: Nearly a quarter of employees in the state’s vital science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math sector are immigrants.89  \nc.  In Hawaii, businesses rely heavily on immigrants who bring their talent, \nknowledge, and expertise to Hawaii’s labor force. See Ex. 124 ¶ 4 (Decl. \nSalaveria). Prior to the increase in unemployment caused by the COVID-19 crisis, \nHawaii had a very low unemployment rate, and the state’s businesses had \ndifficulty filling their vacant positions. Id. ¶ 8. If or when the COVID-19 crisis \nends, and Hawaii returns to the low level of unemployment that was previously \nthe trend, the departure of the DACA population from Hawaii’s workforce will \neventually cause difficulty for Hawaii employers, and have a negative impact on \nHawaii’s economy. Id. ¶ 11.  \nd.  Agriculture and forestry are two of Virginia’s largest private industries. The \nVirginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services estimates that \n                                                 \n89 See New American Economy, Immigrants and the Economy in Connecticut, \nhttps://www.newamericaneconomy.org/locations/connecticut/. \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 85 of 99 PageID #: 7816\napproximately 1,944 of Virginia’s DACA grantees employed in primary \nagricultural production. See Ex. 129 ¶ 3 (Decl. Gooden, Virginia Sec’y of \nAgriculture and Forestry). Further, a percentage of DACA recipients are also \nlikely to be regulated pesticide applicators. The loss of DACA status for these \nindividuals would harm agricultural production and reduce income to Virginia \nfrom pesticide applicator licensing fees. See id. ¶ 7. \ne.  In Washington, DACA grantees work for the largest companies as software \nengineers, finance professionals, and retail and sales associates, including for \nAmazon, Microsoft and Starbucks. See Ex. 63 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Blackwell-Hawkins, \nAmazon); Ex. 90 ¶¶ 7-12, 14 (Decl. Shively, Microsoft); Ex. 8 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. \nMutty, Starbucks).  \nf.  In New York, businesses depend on the work of DACA grantees. See Ex. 170 ¶¶ \n3, 7-8, 10 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶ 7 (Decl. Greenberg, Warby \nParker); Ex. 172 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Morales); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership \nfor NYC). DACA recipients are the consumer base for many New York \nbusinesses. Ex. 170 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. \nGreenberg, Warby Parker). DACA grantees also provide diverse perspectives and \npromote inclusiveness. Ex. 170 ¶¶ 3-9 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶¶ 8-\n11 (Decl. Greenberg, Warby Parker); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 5,8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership \nfor NYC); ; Ex. 81 ¶¶ 2-8 (Decl. Pinsky, ABNY). \n275.  The impact on small businesses and nonprofit organizations will be especially \nstark. For entities with limited staff and operating budgets, losing even one skilled and trained \nDACA grantee employee will place an economic strain on operations, hiring, and training. See, \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 86 of 99 PageID #: 7817\ne.g, Ex. 118 ¶¶ 9-11 (Decl. Igneri); Ex. 117 ¶¶ 5-8 (Decl. Tracy); Ex. 120 ¶ 4 (Decl. Romero); \nEx. 119 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Tingen). Further, many DACA grantees contribute their talents to \nnonprofits in a range of fields, including education and civic engagement. See, e.g, Ex. 55 ¶¶ 8-9 \n(Decl. Perez); Ex 98  ¶ 12 (Decl. 98 Naveed). \n276.  The mission of nonprofit organizations in the States will also be adversely \naffected by the termination of DACA or failure to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status. \nEx. 174 ¶¶ 3-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for NYC). Many nonprofit organizations in the States \nserve immigrant communities, including by providing legal services and advocacy. Termination \nof DACA or failure to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will throw families into \ncrisis, creating higher demand for services from organizations with limited resources. See Ex. \n117 ¶¶ 12-14 (Decl. Tracy, Brazilian Worker Center); Ex. 115 ¶¶ 2-7 (Decl. Tack-Hooper, Am. \nCivil Liberties Union of Delaware); Ex. 116 ¶¶ 2-8 (Decl. Graham). \nHarm to Families. \n277.  The States have an interest in protecting the welfare of all of their residents, \nincluding the families of DACA grantees.  \n278.  Terminating DACA or failing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will \nharm the general welfare of the States’ DACA grantees and their families in profound ways. \nMost DACA grantees live in households with family members who are American citizens. One \nexpert survey estimates that 73% percent of DACA grantees in the country live with a citizen \nsibling, spouse, or child. See Ex. 5 ¶ 34 (Decl. Wong). Terminating DACA or failing to restore it \nto its pre-September 5, 2017 status will lead to increased uncertainty in these mixed-status \nfamilies, and it will increase the likelihood of splitting DACA grantees from their citizen family \nmembers. See e.g., Ex. 176 ¶ 12 (Decl. Kennedy, City of Newburgh). Moreover, many of these \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 87 of 99 PageID #: 7818\nfamilies rely on the income of a DACA grantee, and the termination of DACA or failure to \nreturn DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will threaten their financial and housing \nsecurity. See, e.g., Ex. 87 ¶ 8 (Decl. Rubin); Ex. 135 ¶ 8 (Decl. Rakes); Ex. 157 ¶¶ 12-13 (Decl. \nRidder); Ex. 172 ¶¶ 4-5, 7-8 (Decl. Morales); Ex. 173 ¶¶  3, 5-6 (Decl. Hidalgo Hernandez).  \n279.  Many DACA grantees also have families overseas, including parents and siblings. \nDACA had made it possible for these grantees to visit family members, often for the first time in \nyears. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 7 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 70 ¶ 5 (Decl. I.V.). Terminating DACA or \nfailing to restore it to its pre-September 5, 2017 status will cause DACA grantees to lose touch \nwith these family members and become further estranged from their countries of origin, making \nthe prospect of deportation even more injurious to DACA grantees and their families. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection) \n280.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n281.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal \ngovernment from denying equal protection of the laws.  \n282.  The 2017 DHS Memorandum and Wolf Memo target individuals for \ndiscriminatory treatment, without lawful justification. \n283.  The 2017 DHS Memorandum and Wolf Memo were motivated, at least in part, by \na discriminatory motive and/or a desire to harm a particular group. \n284.  The discriminatory terms and application of the 2017 DHS Memorandum and \nWolf Memo cannot be sufficiently justified by federal interests, under any standard of review. \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 88 of 99 PageID #: 7819\n285.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the equal protection \nguarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n286.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Due Process – Information Use) \n287.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n288.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that actions taken by \nthe federal government be fundamentally fair. \n289.  Given the federal government’s prior representations about the allowable uses of \ninformation provided by DACA applicants, the change to DHS’s policy of protecting against the \ndisclosure of information in DACA applications and renewal requests is fundamentally unfair.  \n290.  Also given the federal government’s prior representations about the allowable \nuses of information provided by DACA applicants, the new policy’s refusal to prohibit the use of \ninformation contained in DACA applications and renewal requests for purposes of immigration \nenforcement—including identifying, apprehending, detaining, or deporting non-citizens—is \nfundamentally unfair. \n291.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the due process guarantee \nof the Fifth Amendment. \n292.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Equitable Estoppel) \n \n293.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 89 of 99 PageID #: 7820\n294.  The doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents injustice where the government has \nmade representations on which individuals have reasonably and detrimentally relied. \n295.  In order to encourage DACA applications, Defendants made repeated, affirmative \nstatements about the protections that would be given to the personal information provided by \nDACA applicants. Defendants also placed affirmative restrictions on the use of such information \nfor purposes of immigration enforcement. \n296.  In submitting DACA applications and renewal requests, DACA applicants \nreasonably and detrimentally relied on Defendants’ affirmative representations and conduct. \n297.  Defendants should be equitably estopped from revoking DHS’s longstanding, \naffirmative policy of protecting against the disclosure of information in DACA applications and \nrenewal requests. \n298.  Equitable estoppel should also bar Defendants from implementing DHS’s new \npolicy of refusing to prohibit the use of information contained in DACA applications and \nrenewal requests for purposes of immigration enforcement, including to identify, apprehend, \ndetain, or deport non-citizens.  \n299.  Failure to estop Defendants from revoking DHS’s previous policy and imposing \nthe new policy will harm the States and their residents.  \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Substantively Arbitrary and Capricious, \nAbuse of Discretion, Contrary to Constitution or Statute) \n \n300.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n301.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), prohibits federal \nagency action that is arbitrary, unconstitutional, and contrary to statute. In implementing the \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 90 of 99 PageID #: 7821\n2017 DHS Memorandum and terminating DACA with minimal formal guidance, federal \nagencies have taken unconstitutional and unlawful action, as alleged herein, in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. \n302.  In promulgating and implementing the 2017 DHS Memorandum, federal agencies \nhave abused their discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously and otherwise not in \naccordance with law, in violation of the APA. \n303.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Procedurally Arbitrary and Capricious, \nNotice and Comment) \n \n304.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n305.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D), requires that federal agencies conduct \nformal rule making before engaging in action that impacts substantive rights. \n306.   DHS is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n307.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the 2017 DHS Memorandum are \n“rules” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). \n308.  In promulgating and implementing the 2017 DHS Memorandum, federal agencies \nhave categorically and definitively changed the substantive criteria by which individual DACA \ngrantees work, live, attend school, obtain credit, and travel in the United States. Federal agencies \ndid not follow the procedures required by the APA before taking action impacting these \nsubstantive rights. \n309.   With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency rules must go through \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 91 of 99 PageID #: 7822\n310.  The Defendants promulgated and relied upon the rules established by the 2017 \nDHS Memorandum without authority and without notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation \nof the APA.  \n311.  The States will be impacted because they have not had the opportunity to \ncomment on the termination of DACA. \n312.   Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Regulatory Flexibility Act – Failure to Issue Regulatory Flexibility Analyses) \n313.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n314.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), requires federal \nagencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \nfinal versions of those analyses for public comment. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n315.  “Small entities” for purposes of the RFA includes small businesses, small \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions. 5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n316.  The promulgation and implementation of the 2017 DHS Memorandum and Wolf \nMemo established “rules” under the RFA. 5 U.S.C. § 601(2). \n317.  Implementation of the 2017 DHS Memorandum and Wolf Memo is likely to have \na significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. § 602(a)(1). \n318.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules.  \n319.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \nviolates the RFA and is unlawful. \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 92 of 99 PageID #: 7823\n320.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States, their small \ngovernmental jurisdictions, nonprofits, and businesses, and their residents. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment-Procedural Due Process) \n321.  The Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nin each of the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n322.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal \ngovernment from depriving individuals of their liberty interests or property interests without due \nprocess of law.  \n323.  Defendants have failed to provide DACA grantees with the due process to which \nthey are entitled, by failing to provide them with adequate notice about the procedures and \ntimeline for renewing their DACA status. \n324.  Defendants have failed to provide DACA grantees with the due process to which \nthey are entitled, by failing to give them adequate notice about the general termination of the \nDACA program after March 5, 2018 and by failing to provide DACA grantees adequate notice \nof their inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018. \n325.  Defendants are thus depriving Plaintiff States’ residents of their liberty and \nproperty interests in living and working in the United States without providing them adequate \nnotice or opportunity to be heard.  \n326.  Defendants’ conduct violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n327.  Defendants’ violations cause ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 93 of 99 PageID #: 7824\nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious, Contrary to Law, Excess of \nStatutory Authority – July 2020 Wolf Memo) \n \n328.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n329.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), prohibits federal agency action that \nis arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or that is \nin excess of statutory authority. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n330.  Defendants’ implementation of the Wolf Memo to make interim changes to the \nDACA program are not supported by any reasonable explanation for the agency action, fail to \nassess the harms of applying the policy retroactively, fail to consider the significant reliance \ninterests at stake, and were ordered by an agency official acting in his position without lawful \nauthority, and are therefore arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of Defendants’ \nstatutory authority, in violation of the APA. \n331.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Federal Vacancies Reform Act and Homeland Security Act) \n332.  The Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nin each of the preceding paragraphs of this Second Amended Supplemental Complaint. \n333.  Under the FVRA, an agency action taken by an unlawfully serving acting official \n“shall have no force and effect” and “may not be ratified” after the fact.  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), \n(2). \n334.  The HSA establishes an order of succession for the position of Acting Secretary \nof Homeland Security. 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A), 113(g)(1), 113(g)(2). \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 94 of 99 PageID #: 7825\n335.  Defendant Wolf’s predecessor, Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, was not the \nlawful successor to former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and therefore lacked the authority to \namend DHS’s order of succession that made Defendant Wolf next in line for the acting role.  \nBecause, under the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1).  McAleenan’s amendments to the order of \nsuccession were performed without lawful authority, they “shall have no force and effect.” In \nturn, Defendant Wolf’s assumption of the role of Acting Secretary based on McAleenan’s ultra \nvires amendment to the succession order is also unlawful under the HSA and FVRA. \n336.  Because Defendant Wolf is unlawfully serving as Acting Secretary, the official \nactions he has taken in that role, including making changes to the DACA program through the \nWolf Memo, are ultra vires actions that are void ab initio under the plain terms of the FVRA.  \nUnder the FVRA, the changes to the DACA program ordered by the Wolf Memo therefore have \n“no force and effect.” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1). \n337.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the States pray that the Court: \na.  Declare that the 2017 DHS Memorandum terminating the DACA program and the \nWolf Memo changing the DACA program are unauthorized by and contrary to the \nConstitution and laws of the United States; \nb.  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the 2017 DHS \nMemorandum terminating the DACA program and the Wolf Memo changing the \nDACA program are procedurally unlawful under the APA; \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 95 of 99 PageID #: 7826\nc.  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the 2017 DHS \nMemorandum terminating the DACA program and the Wolf Memo changing the \nDACA program are substantively unlawful under the APA; \nd.  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the 2017 DHS \nMemorandum terminating the DACA program and the Wolf Memo changing the \nDACA program are unlawful under the RFA; \ne.  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nis unlawful under the FVRA and HSA; \nf.  Declare that the Wolf Memo is invalid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \nand Homeland Security Act; \ng.  Vacate the changes the Wolf Memo effected to the DACA program; \nh.  Enjoin Defendants from terminating or amending the DACA program, including \nenjoining the Defendants from limiting rights to submit applications to renew \nDACA benefits, pending further orders from this Court; \ni.  Enjoin Defendants from revoking the DHS policy protecting DACA application \nand renewal data from disclosure to ICE, CBP, or any other agency for purposes \nof immigration enforcement; \nj.  Enjoin Defendants from using information obtained in any DACA application or \nrenewal request to identify, apprehend, detain, or deport any DACA applicant or \nmember of any DACA applicant’s family, or take any action against a DACA \napplicant’s current or former employer;  \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 271   Filed 08/28/20   Page 96 of 99 PageID #: 7827\nk.  Hold the Wolf Memo invalid and vacate the changes the Wolf Memo effected to \nDACA; and \nl.

Many amici employ Dreamers—the young\npeople who, under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, are able to live\nand work in the country that has been their home for most of their young lives. In addition,\namici’s customers and end users are Dreamers; and amici’s businesses benefit from Dreamers’\ncontributions to the overall economy through their tax payments, spending, and investments.\nAccordingly, amici have a strong interest in Dreamers’ continued ability to work and participate\ninourcountry’s economyandinsocietygenerally. Alist oftheamiciis set forthin Appendix A.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe intangible benefits of the DACA program are undeniable and substantial: nearly\n800,000 young people (Dreamers) who “were brought to this country as children and know only\nthis countryas home” mayfor the first time live in America and participate fullyin all aspects of\nour society without the constant and crippling fear of deportation. Memorandum from Janet\nNapolitano to David V. Aguilar Regarding Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to\nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, 2012). DACA is a concrete\nand essential example of America fulfilling its centuries-old promise to welcome people from\naround the world seeking a better and a freer life. And no group is more deserving of that\nwelcomethanthe Dreamers.\nIn addition to these invaluable intangible benefits, DACA has produced—and is\ncontinuing to produce—important benefits for America’s companies and for our economy as a\nwhole. Most notably, DACA permits Dreamers to obtain work authorization, thereby enabling\nthem to obtain jobs. Employment of Dreamers expands work opportunities for everyone,\nbecause employment is not a zero-sum game. Dreamers are filling vacancies at companies that\n1\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 132   Filed 12/21/17   Page 9 of 29 PageID #: 6410\ncannot find enoughworkers tofill theirneeds. AndDreamers’ wages lead tohighertax revenues\nandexpansionofournational GDP—producingnewjobs forall Americans.\nDACA’s rescission will inflict serious harm on U.S. companies, all workers, and the\nAmerican economy as a whole. Indeed, our national GDP will lose $460.3 billion, and Social\nSecurity and Medicare tax contributions will be reduced by $24.6 billion, over the next decade.\nBut those dire consequence should never come to fruition because DACA’s rescission cannot be\npermitted stand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rescinded DACA based entirely\non its legal conclusion that it exceeds the agency’s statutory authority. That legal conclusion is\nwrong: DACA closely resembles deferred action programs adopted in the past, and complies\nfullywiththeapplicable statute.\nARGUMENT\nI. DACA’S RESCISSIONWILL INFLICT SIGNIFICANT HARMON U.S.\nCOMPANIES ANDTHE ENTIRE ECONOMY.\nSince the nation’s founding, immigrants have been an integral part of the fabric of our\ncountry, enhancing the lives and prosperity of all Americans. Immigrants’ contributions to the\nU.S. economy are well-recognized: For example, the businesses they own generate over $775\nbillioninrevenueandemployoneout of every10 workers.1\nDACA enabled Dreamers—immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children—to\ncome out of the shadows, participate in the economy, and contribute to U.S. companies, which\nbenefits all of us. Rescinding DACA harms not only individual Dreamers and their families,\nfriends, and co-workers; but also the many U.S. businesses that count on them to help fuel\ncontinuedinnovationand economic growth.\n1 P’ship for a New Am.

Dreamers ContributeDirectlyToOurNation’s Economic Growth.\nIn the five years since DACA was implemented, Dreamers have become essential\ncontributors to American companies and the American economy. Prior to the DACA program,\nthese young people—who have obtained at least a high school degree and, in many cases have\nfinished college and obtained graduate degrees—would have been unable to obtain work\nauthorization, and therefore unable to put their education and skills to use. DACA changed that,\nand as a result over 91 percent of the almost 800,000 Dreamers are employed and earn wages\ncommensurate with their skill levels.2 Permitting Dreamers to stay and work in the country in\nwhich they grew up not only benefits those individuals, but also benefits American companies\nandtheAmericaneconomyas a whole.\nFirst, Dreamers directly contribute to the success of numerous U.S. companies. At least\n72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ Dreamers—including IBM, Walmart,\nApple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, Wells Fargo, among others.\nThosecompanies alone generatealmost $3trillioninannual revenue.3\nMany Dreamers are entrepreneurs who have created their own businesses: According to\none survey, five percent of Dreamers started their own businesses after receiving DACA status.\nAmong those respondents 25 years and older, the figure is eight percent—well above the 3.1\n2 Tom K.

Nearly two-thirds of Dreamers reported purchasing their first car in 2017, and 16\npercent reported purchasing a first home.8 These and other types of personal consumption\nexpenditures are important drivers of the economy: they “account[] for the largest share of GDP\n[and] arethemaingeneratorofemployment intheeconomy.”9\nB.

PermittingDreamersto participatein theworkforceexpands, rather\nthan reduces, thenumberof jobs.\n“[O]ne of the best-known fallacies in economics” is the “lump of labour fallacy.”11\nEconomists from across the policy and political spectrum have discredited the notion that “there\nis afixedamount ofworktobedone—alumpof labour”—suchthat anincreaseinthenumberof\nworkers reduces the number of available jobs.12 Rather, the clear reality is that jobs beget more\njobs. “[W]hen people work for a living they earn money. They spend that money on goods and\nservices that are produced by other people, young and old, male and female.”13 The greater\ndemandfor goods andservices creates newjobs.\nThe facts are indisputable. “From 1970 to 2017, the U.S. labor force doubled. Rather\nthan ending up with a 50 percent unemployment rate, U.S. employment doubled.”14 Another\nstudy showed that countries with high employment levels of older workers also had high\nemployment levels of young workers; in other words, high employment levels in one group\n10 See Michael Greenstone & Adam Looney, What Immigration Means for U.S.\nEmployment and Wages 1-2, The Hamilton Project (2012), https://goo.gl/bvC7AE; Kenneth\nMegan, Immigration and the Labor Force, Bipartisan Policy Ctr., Aug. 25, 2015,\nhttps://goo.gl/8p3SP8; Michael A.

Dreamers fill critical laborshortages.\nThe jobs being filled by Dreamers post-DACA are largely jobs for which there is a\nshortageof qualified workers—not thejobs that areor couldbe filledbyU.S.-bornworkers. In a\nrecent survey of U.S. employers, 46 percent of respondents reported difficulty filling jobs—\nparticularly in skilled labor positions, such as teachers, accounting and finance staff, nurses, and\nengineers.19 Almost a quarter of employers reported a lack of available applicants; another 34\npercent cited a shortage of applicants with necessaryskills.20 In 2012, the President’s Council of\nAdvisors onScience and Technologywarned that withinten years, the U.S. couldfacea shortfall\n15 Buttonwood,supran.13.\n16 See Jacqueline Varas, How Immigration Helps U.S. Workers and the Economy, American\nAction Forum,Mar.20, 2017,https://goo.gl/ovHQEh.\n17 See Nat’l Conference of State Legislatures, National Employment Monthly Update,\nhttps://goo.gl/wZBJh8(last accessedOct.31,2017).\n18 U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Job Openings and Labor Turnover\nSurvey,https://goo.gl/g4n9Ag(last accessedOct. 31,2017).\n19 See ManpowerGroup, 2016/2017 Talent Shortage Survey: The United States Results\n(“ManpowerGroup 2016/2017”), https://goo.gl/rJTKs6; see also Rachel Unruh & Amanda\nBergson-Shilcock, Nat’l Skills Coalition, Missing in Action 3-4 (2015), https://goo.gl/gokfJW\n(“In 2012, middle-skill jobs accounted for 54 percent of the U.S. labor market, but only 44\npercent ofthecountry’s workers weretrainedtothemiddle-skill level.”).\n20 ManpowerGroup2016/2017,supran.19.\n6\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 132   Filed 12/21/17   Page 14 of 29 PageID #: 6415\nof nearly one million professionals in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\n(STEM) fields.21 Even putting aside the skills mismatch, it is unlikely that there are enough\navailable workers to fill the openings: The U.S. unemployment rate is currently quite low, and\nthenumberofjobopenings is high.22\nDreamers help fill this gap.

The fear for the future that is now a daily part of life for Dreamers and their\nfamilies affects both physical and mental health.34 That, in turn, negatively affects employee\nproductivityandperformance,illness and absenteeism,accidents,andturnover.35\nOnce Dreamers’ work authorizations begin expiring in March 2018, companies will face\nan estimated $6.3 billion in costs to replace Dreamers—if they can even find new employees to\nfill the empty positions.36 Companies will forfeit the money they invested in training Dreamers,\nImmigrant Legal Resources Center,Money onthe Table:The Economic Cost of Ending DACA 4,\n6-7 (2016), https://goo.gl/3ZwGVJ; see also Brannon & Albright, supra n.8 (estimating cost of\n“immediately eliminating the DACA program and deporting its participants” to be $283 billion\nreductionineconomic growthandover$60billionreductiontotax revenues over10 years).\n33 Ctr. for Am.

People are the heart of\nevery business; and every company’s goal is to create teams that work seamlessly together—\nteams in which colleagues support each other both within and outside the workplace. Ripping\nDreamers out of their jobs hurts not only Dreamers, but other employees who lose friends and\ncolleagues, and companies that losetrustedmembers oftheirteams.\nHistory shows that forcing Dreamers out of the workforce and into the shadows will also\nreduce job growth and harm the U.S. economy. After Arizona passed the Legal Arizona\nWorkers Act in 2007, which targeted the use of unauthorized workers, its population of\nundocumented workers dropped by 40 percent. Economic growth fell, reducing job\nopportunities: The state’s total employment was 2.5 percent less than what it would have been\nwithout the laws, and its GDP was reduced by an average of 2 percent a year between 2008 and\n2015.38\nSimilarly, in 1964, the U.S. expelled Mexican braceros, who were previously permitted\nto work temporarily in the U.S., mostly on farms.

That effect will be\nexacerbated as Dreamers are forced to shutter businesses that employ other workers and other\ncompanies lose the income that has helped drive demand and production of goods and services\nprovidedbyU.S.-bornworkers.41\nAnd the harm will be much more far-reaching: Just as DACA sent a powerful message\nof inclusion, its rescission tells the immigrants who have been integral to the growth and\ndevelopment ofoursocietyand economyfordecades that theyarenolongerwelcomehere. As a\nresult, DACA’s rescission will reduce the future ability of U.S. companies to attract individuals\nfrom aroundthe worldtosupport America’s continuedeconomic growthandprosperity.\nII. THE DECISIONTO RESCINDDACAIS INVALID, BECAUSE IT IS\nARBITRARYAND CAPRICIOUS ANDCONTRARYTO LAW.\nDHS rescinded DACAbasedentirelyonits legal conclusionthat DACA“was effectuated\n. . . without proper statutory authority” and therefore “was an unconstitutional exercise of\nauthority by the Executive Branch.” Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Secretary,\nDep’t of Homeland Security, on Rescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled\n“ExercisingProsecutorial DiscretionWithRespect to Individuals WhoCametotheUnitedStates\nas Children” (Sept. 5, 2017).

See 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A); Safe Air\nFor Everyone v. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Because [EPA’s flawed legal\ninterpretation] is fundamental to EPA’s determination that [the State] did not contravene [the\nClean Air Act], EPA’s outcome on those statutory interpretation questions is ‘arbitrary,\ncapricious,orotherwise not inaccordancewithlaw’forthepurposes ofourreview.”).\nDHS’s legal interpretation was plainly erroneous, and its decision to rescind DACA\ntherefore cannot stand. DACA confers two related benefits: deferral of government action to\nremove the individual from the United States (known as “deferred action”) and eligibility for\nworkauthorization. Bothelements havelongbeenrecognizedinU.S.immigrationlaw.\nFirst, granting “deferred action” is a long-established practice engaged in by\nAdministrations of both parties and expressly recognized by the Supreme Court. See Reno v.\nAmerican Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (“AAADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 483-85 (1999)\n(describing“regularpractice”of “deferred action”).42 Thedecisiontodefer removal proceedings\nis an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that falls squarely within the Executive Branch’s\nconstitutional authority to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II,\n§3.\nIn the immigration context, moreover, Congress has codified that discretion. Until 1940,\n“the deportation statute unyieldingly demanded that an alien illegally in the United States be\ndeported.” Johns v. DOJ, 653 F.2d 884, 890 n.12 (5th Cir. 1981). Now, however, the\n42 See also Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012) (“A principal feature of the\nremoval system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.”); CHARLES GORDON\nET AL., 6-72 IMMIGRATION LAW AND PROC. §72.03 (Matthew Bender, rev. ed.); Mem. Op. for\nthe Sec’y of Homeland Security and the Counsel to the President, 38 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 1,\n13-18(Nov.19,2014),https://www.justice.gov/file/179206/download.\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 132   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 29 PageID #: 6421\nimmigration laws specifically charge the secretary of Homeland Security with “establishing\nnational immigration enforcement policies and priorities,” 6 U.S.C. §202(5), and to carryout the\n“administration and enforcement of th[e INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and\nnaturalization of aliens,” 8 U.S.C. §1103(a); see also H.R. Rep. No. 11-157, at 8 (2009)\n(“[R]ather than simply rounding up as many illegal immigrants as possible, which is sometimes\nachieved by targeting the easiest and least threatening among the undocumented population,\nDHS must ensure that the government’s huge investments in immigration enforcement are\nproducingthemaximumreturninactuallymakingourcountrysafer.”).\nCongress has on several occasions expanded deferred action to certain categories of\nindividuals.43 And it enacted 8 U.S.C. §1252(g), which the Supreme Court explained was\nintended to preserve the INS’s exercise of discretion in granting deferred action while “giv[ing]\nsomemeasureofprotectionto‘nodeferred action’ decisions.” AAADC,525U.S.at 484-85.\nSecond, conferring eligibility for work authorization has a similarly lengthy pedigree. A\nregulation promulgated in the 1980s provides that individuals who receive deferred action are\neligible to apply for work authorization. See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (providing eligibility to\napply for work authorization to “[a]n alien who has been granted deferred action”). Congress\nhas legislated on the basis of this regulation, enacting a law prohibiting employers from hiring\nunauthorized aliens, but expressly excluding from that category individuals “authorized to be so\nemployed by . . . the Attorney General.” 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3); cf. 49 U.S.C. §30301 note\n43 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (providing that certain aliens who self-\npetition for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, Tit. V,\n108 Stat. 1092, are eligible to request “deferred action”); USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-\n56, § 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (2001) (providing that certain family members of lawful\npermanent residents killed on September 11, 2001, or of citizens killed in combat, are “eligible\nfordeferred action”); National Defense AuthorizationAct for Fiscal Year2004,Pub. L.No. 108-\n136,§1703(c)-(d),117Stat.1392,1694-1695(2003)(same).\n13\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 132   Filed 12/21/17   Page 21 of 29 PageID #: 6422\n(providing that certain states mayissue driver’s licenses to aliens with “approved deferred action\nstatus”).\nIn concluding that DACA was an unconstitutional exercise of authority, DHS claimed\nthat DACA suffered from the defect identified by the Fifth Circuit in a case challenging a\nseparate deferred action program, DAPA. But the plaintiffs in that earlier case did not challenge\nthe authority of the Executive Branch to exercise its discretion to defer removal with respect to\ncertain undocumentedimmigrants, evenon a categorical basis. Instead, the disputecenteredon a\nstatement in the memorandum implementing DAPA that “for a specified period of time, an\nindividual [covered by DAPA] is permitted to be lawfully present in the United States.” See\nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 147-49, 166, 179-84 (5th Cir. 2015). The claim was that\nDHS lacked the authority to confer “lawful[] presen[ce]” and the Fifth Circuit agreed. The\nmemorandum establishing DACA contains no such language, and the Fifth Circuit’s rationale is\nthereforeinapplicable.\nIn short, ample constitutional and statutory authorityexists for DACA. DHS’s rescission\nofDACAbasedon acontrarylegal conclusionis accordinglyunfoundedandshouldbevacated.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, amici urge the Court to grant Plaintiffs’ motions for\npreliminaryinjunction.\n14\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 132   Filed 12/21/17   Page 22 of 29 PageID #: 6423\nOfCounsel: /s/ Andrew J.Pincus\nAndrewJ.Pincus (pro hacvice)\nSethP.Waxman\nMAYERBROWNLLP\nPatrickJ.Carome\n1999KStreet NW\nAri Holtzblatt\nWashington, DC20006\nWILMERCUTLERPICKERINGHALEAND\n(202)263-3000\nDORRLLP\napincus@mayerbrown.com\n1875Pennsylvania Avenue,NW\nWashington,D.C.20006\nLaurenR.Goldman\nTelephone: (202)663-6000\nKarenW.

The rescission of DACA \nhas not only caused harm to immigrants themselves, but also to their families and communities, \nincluding the many organizations (such as PIOs) that serve those communities, and thus \nunderscores the need to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and restore DACA \npending a final decision on the merits.  \nWhen DACA was adopted in 2012, young undocumented immigrants brought to the \nUnited States as children through no choice of their own (known as “Dreamers”), could apply to \nremain and work lawfully in the United States.  See Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, Sec’y \nof Homeland Sec., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., to David V. Aguilar, Acting Comm’r, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Prot., et al., at 2–3 (June 15, 2012) (“2012 DACA Memo”), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-\ncame-to-us-as-children.pdf.  They gained the opportunities—previously denied to them as \nundocumented immigrants—to live, attend U.S. colleges and universities, work for living wages \n                                                 \n1   The Legal Aid Society, African Services Committee, College Confident, The Door—A Center for \nAlternatives, Empire Justice Center, The Immigrant and Non-Citizen Rights Clinic at the CUNY School of Law, \nImmigrant Justice Corps, MinKwon Center for Community Action, Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project, Safe Horizon, Sosa Law, South Bronx United, TODEC Legal Center, UnLocal \nand Volunteers of Legal Service. \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 6 of 26 PageID #: 6917\n \n \nand otherwise fully participate in their communities without fear of removal.  PIOs saw it as their \nrole to help unlock these opportunities for Dreamers and their families, and from the start \ndedicated many of their resources to assisting as many young people as possible to obtain and \nmaintain DACA. \nThe termination of DACA five years later, on September 5, 2017, has upended the lives \nof Dreamers.  It has stripped them of deferred action and with it the ability to remain and work in \nthe United States.  It has undermined the fabric of the communities in which they had been \ncontributing so greatly.  With no certainty about their futures in the only country they know as \nhome, Dreamers are deeply fearful and concerned about their ability to support themselves and \nthose who rely on them, including their parents, spouses and U.S.-citizen children. \nBecause there is so much at stake for so many, PIOs have likewise dedicated themselves \nto assisting as many Dreamers as possible to renew and maintain their status.  The capacity of \nPIOs to manage the enormous impact of the rescission of DACA, however, is limited, and \nfurther illustrates the irreparable harm caused by the termination of DACA and the need for a \npreliminary injunction to prevent it.  \nINTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE \nThe arbitrary rescission of DACA is detrimental to PIOs and their clients.  It has not only \nburdened PIOs and unduly taxed their scarce resources but will also force these organizations, \nmany of which employ individuals with DACA, to lay off valuable staff.  Each of the amici \ntherefore has a direct interest in challenging the unjustified rescission of DACA.  See Addendum. \nBACKGROUND \nOn any typical day, there are simply not enough legal resources available to meet the \nlegal needs of low-income non-citizens generally.  That shortage has been exacerbated by the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 7 of 26 PageID #: 6918\n \n \narbitrary and abrupt rescission of DACA on September 5, 2017.  The impact was felt not only by \nPIOs (and of course their Dreamer clients), but also by the partners of PIOs in the private bar, bar \nassociations and law schools.  Moreover, as described below, the rescission also impacted the \nunrelated clients of PIOs with other immigration needs who depend on PIOs for assistance.  \nFinally, it affects the advocates who work around the clock to improve the lives of all \nimmigrants. \nI.  The Role of PIOs Regarding DACA Applicants \n \nSince DACA’s inception in 2012, PIOs have played a critical role in ensuring that \ninformation on DACA reaches its intended beneficiaries.  Relying on multilingual staff, PIOs \nhave provided young immigrants with accessible and reliable information about DACA by, for \nexample, creating know-your-rights pamphlets, hosting clinics and information sessions, \npromoting information through social media and counseling members of their communities. \nFor many clients, PIOs also provide step-by-step assistance to candidates applying for \nDACA, including: \n1.  Screening:  PIOs screen interested candidates to ensure that they meet eligibility \ncriteria, including age, entry, residency and criminal history requirements.  They \nalso provide legal advice on immigration law and United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) policies and practices tailored to each \napplicant’s unique circumstances in order to confirm his or her eligibility for \nDACA. \n \n2.  Application:  PIOs assist eligible candidates with completing and filing DACA \napplications, which is not a simple process.  The DACA application instructions \nalone are fourteen pages, and, at a minimum, applicants must complete three \nseparate forms—Form I-821D, Form I-765 and Form I-765WS—and provide \nsupporting documents.  It is therefore unsurprising that many applicants need \nlegal assistance in preparing a DACA application, as USCIS itself has recognized.  \nSee Find Legal Services, USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/avoid-scams/find- \nlegal-services (last visited Dec. 22, 2017) (“If [applicants] are not sure . . . which \nUSCIS forms to submit, then [they] may need immigration legal advice from an \nauthorized service provider.”). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 8 of 26 PageID #: 6919\n \n \n3.  Monitoring and Follow-up:  PIOs continue to provide DACA-related services \neven after their clients’ applications have been submitted by monitoring the status \nof applications, reaching out to clients regarding updates and answering clients’ \nquestions about USCIS follow-up, such as biometric appointments to obtain \nfingerprints and facial scans, which are required each time DACA is granted or \nrenewed.  If USCIS sends a request for evidence in order to further evaluate \nDACA eligibility or a rejection notice, PIOs generally assist clients in \nre-submitting an application and gathering any additional supporting documents \nor seeking alternative forms of immigration relief.  \n \n4.  Anticipating and Handling Renewals:  PIOs reach out to clients prior to the \nexpiration of their two-year work authorizations and provide assistance with \nrenewal applications.  While the process is simpler than an initial application \nbecause all of the documentation needed to establish initial eligibility for DACA \nneed not be re-submitted, each renewal application still requires applicants to re-\nfile Form I-821D, Form I-765 and Form I-765WS; pay the $495 filing fee; and \nsubmit supporting documents.  PIOs work with clients to file their renewal \napplications, ensure that they are consistent with previous submissions and gather \nany necessary supporting documentation.  Because an applicant’s circumstances \nmay have changed since initially applying for DACA (due to, for example, travel \noutside of the country or an arrest since their initial application), applicants may \nneed additional legal advice regarding renewal, which PIOs provide. \nThus, PIOs serve a critical function in helping potential candidates navigate DACA.  \nConsequently, the demand for their legal services following the issuance of the 2012 DACA \nMemo was overwhelming:  prospective applicants slept on sidewalks outside of PIOs in order to \nbe among the first to seek legal assistance in obtaining relief.  See Undocumented immigrants \nline up for relief from deportation, CNN.com (Aug. 17, 2012), http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/ \nus/immigration-deferred-deportation/index.html.  For example, approximately 150 interested \ncandidates waited outside of The Legal Aid Society’s offices on each DACA clinic day in 2012.  \nThe Legal Aid Society met with approximately seventy-five eligible candidates per day after the \nannouncement of DACA, and, even then, the need for services outstripped capacity.  PIOs \nworked to meet the demand.  Indeed, amici have collectively handled over 10,000 DACA cases. \nIn addition, many PIOs provide immigration services beyond assisting with DACA \napplications and often identify individuals eligible for permanent forms of immigration relief \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 9 of 26 PageID #: 6920\n \n \nthrough their DACA outreach efforts.  For example, The Legal Aid Society performs \ncomprehensive eligibility screening for DACA applicants in an effort to select the most \nadvantageous form of immigration relief available for each client, DACA or otherwise, such as \nAdjustment of Status, U Nonimmigrant Status (for victims of domestic violence who have \ncooperated with law enforcement) or asylum or other relief under the Convention Against \nTorture, and assists clients with applying for that selected form of relief.  See also Brief of Legal \nServices Organizations 3–12, New York v. Trump, No. 1:17-cv-5228 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2017) \n(“LSO Br.”). \nII.  The Response of PIOs to the Rescission of DACA \n \nAs explained in Plaintiffs’ brief, in a sudden and unexpected change in policy, DACA \nwas rescinded in its entirety in a memorandum issued by Acting Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Elaine C. Duke on September 5, 2017 (“Duke Memo”).  Memorandum from \nElaine C. Duke, Acting Sec’y, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., to James W. McCament, Acting \nDir., USCIS, et al., https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca.  The \nDuke Memo provided an exception to this total withdrawal of DACA only for those people \nwhose DACA would expire between September 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018.  Individuals eligible \nfor this exception could renew their work authorization for an additional two years.  However, \nUSCIS set an unprecedented and arbitrary one-month window (from September 5, 2017 to \nOctober 5, 2017) for those individuals to renew their DACA.  Id.  USCIS also required that \nrenewal applications be physically received by USCIS on or before October 5, 2017.  Id. \nThe termination of DACA and the arbitrary one-month window for renewal applications \ncaused PIOs—which serve as a critical bridge in communicating information from USCIS to \nthousands of intended beneficiaries—to have to scramble.  Following the release of the Duke \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 10 of 26 PageID #: 6921\n \n \nMemo, PIOs had less than one month to develop and implement a comprehensive response.  \nPIOs engaged in extensive community outreach and counseled candidates who were immediately \nand adversely impacted by the rescission, including those who had been eligible for DACA but \nhad not yet applied as of September 5, 2017; who had let their status expire in reliance upon \nUSCIS’s past practice of allowing a one-year renewal grace period (which in many cases was \nbecause candidates were unable to afford the $495 filing fee); whose DACA would expire after \nMarch 5, 2018; and who were not eligible for DACA at the time but would have been in the \nfuture.  Absent other circumstances that would qualify clients for alternative forms of \nimmigration relief, PIOs could do nothing to reassure these individuals of their ability to remain, \nlive and work in the United States. \nAs to candidates whose DACA was set to expire between September 5, 2017 and \nMarch 5, 2018, and thus were eligible for renewal, there was simply not enough time to reach all \nof the individuals affected by this abrupt policy change.  Some PIOs attempted to meet demand \nby working more than twelve-hour days, including every weekend from September 5, 2017 \nthrough October 4, 2017, and putting many new and less time-sensitive cases on hold.  For \nexample, The Legal Aid Society typically partners with thirteen community-based organizations \nto conduct monthly immigration outreach clinics to provide advice and representation to eligible \nindividuals, reaching over 140 new individuals each month.  However, the Duke Memo’s \npronouncements substantially limited The Legal Aid Society’s ability to conduct business as \nusual.  Although The Legal Aid Society continued its outreach through partner organizations \nduring that period, it held in abeyance all but the most urgent new and pending matters in order \nto meet the staffing needs associated with DACA renewal.  In the short timeframe provided \nunder the Duke Memo, The Legal Aid Society focused on reaching out individually to its prior \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 11 of 26 PageID #: 6922\n \n \nDACA clients to advise them of the renewal eligibility criteria and time period; meeting with \nDACA renewal clients in the office; conducting DACA renewal clinics; participating in the New \nYork statewide DACA Day of Action sponsored by the Immigrant Active Response \nCollaborative; and operating an immigration hotline.  PIOs with fewer resources than The Legal \nAid Society could only conduct limited outreach.  While some PIOs reviewed their client \ndatabases and contacted all individuals eligible to renew their DACA during this limited \nwindow, others did not have time to do so or simply could not reach all affected individuals. \nRegarding eligible candidates whom they could reach, PIOs also recognized that many of \ntheir clients could not raise the $495 renewal application fee during the one-month renewal \nperiod.2  PIOs therefore sought to raise funds or drew on emergency funds in order to cover the \napplication and other fees, such as mailing fees.3 \nIII.  Recent Problems Renewing DACA Confronted by the Clients of PIOs  \n \nAside from depriving qualified candidates of the ability to obtain and maintain DACA \nrelief going forward, USCIS’s conduct to date regarding renewal applications has prevented \notherwise eligible candidates from successfully renewing and maintaining DACA in the short \n                                                 \n2   Letter from Members of Congress to Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec’y, Dep’t Homeland Sec. (Sept. 26, 2017), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-daca2017 (“[T]he decision to require all DACA recipients \nwhose permits expire in the next six months to have their renewal submitted by October 5th is a deadline that is \narbitrary and puts an undue financial burden on many law abiding people within the program.”); see also Press \nRelease, Kamala D. Harris, In HSGAC Hearing, Sen Harris Presses Acting DHS Sec Duke on Puerto Rico Response \nand DACA (Sept. 27, 2017), https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/in-hsgac-hearing-sen-harris-presses-\nacting-dhs-sec-duke-on-puerto-rico-response-and-daca (Senator Kamala Harris stated that the deadline requires \napplicants to “provide a $495 application fee within one month,” and “supply two passport photographs, [which] \ncost between about 15–20 dollars” and observed that the “last time I looked federal minimum wage is about $7.25 \nan hour.”). \n3   Other PIOs advised clients regarding the process for obtaining a fee exemption.  However, applying for a \nfee exemption was risky because the exemption must be approved prior to filing a DACA renewal application, and \nas such there is no guarantee that applicants seeking a fee exemption would be able to renew before October 5, \n2017.  See Guidance for an Exemption from the Fee for a Form I-765 Filed with a Request for Consideration of \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/forms/forms-and-fees/guidance-exemption-\nfee-form-i-765-filed-request-consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals (last visited Dec. 22, 2017).    \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 12 of 26 PageID #: 6923\n \n \nterm.  USCIS has rejected many DACA renewal applications as a result of mail delays and minor \nclerical errors.  For example, USCIS rejected as untimely numerous renewal applications that \nhad arrived at the proper USCIS post office boxes on October 5, 2017, the filing deadline, and \nwere marked ready for pick-up on that day but that USCIS, with no credible justification, did not \nappear to have collected until the following day, after the deadline had passed. \nOther clients’ applications, which were mailed well in advance of the October 5, 2017 \ndeadline, were inexplicably delayed by the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) for weeks and \nin some cases over a month, as discussed below.  As a result of this admitted error by USPS, and \nthrough no fault of the applicants, these applications were not received by USCIS by the \nOctober 5, 2017 deadline and were subsequently rejected by USCIS as untimely.  See Guidance \non Rejected DACA Requests, USCIS (“Q&A”), https://www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance- \nrejected-daca2017 (last updated Dec. 14, 2017).  For example, an Immigrant Justice Corps client \nmailed an application via USPS on September 15, 2017, but it was not received at USCIS’s \nChicago lockbox until October 18, 2017 and was rejected as untimely.  Although USCIS has \nstated that it will invite applicants affected by USPS mail delays to reapply, it will only do so \nwhere USPS can identify the individual or where the individual can otherwise prove to USCIS’s \nLockbox Support that there was a USPS error.  See id.   \nIn addition, other applications appear to have been rejected by USCIS for alleged clerical \nerrors, with no possibility for relief.  For example, a South Bronx United client mailed an \napplication on September 18, 2017, which USCIS marked as received on October 11, 2017.  It \nwas rejected not for untimely filing but erroneously for lacking the current DACA expiration \ndate (even though proof of expiration was included in the materials).  When South Bronx United \nfollowed up on October 31, 2017, USCIS claimed that there was no record of receipt of the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 13 of 26 PageID #: 6924\n \n \napplication, despite having issued a rejection letter dated October 29, 2017, and reiterated its \nposition that USCIS was no longer accepting DACA renewals. \nAs PIOs have become aware of the erroneous or arbitrary conduct of USCIS in relation to \nmail delays and clerical errors, PIOs have devoted significant time and attention to advocate on \nbehalf of clients, who made every effort to comply with USCIS instructions and deadlines but \nwhose applications were rejected through no fault of their own.  PIOs’ advocacy has resulted in \nrelief for certain applications rejected as a result of USPS’s delays, but USCIS’s refusal to \nreconsider other, equally compelling cases further justifies preliminary injunctive relief. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Rescission of DACA Has Caused and Will Continue to Cause Irreparable \nHarm to Clients Served by Amici PIOs \n \nA.  Dreamer Clients of Amici PIOs Have Limited Alternatives to DACA  \n \nAs set forth in Plaintiffs’ brief, Dreamers have suffered and will continue to suffer grave \nharm each day until action is taken to rescind the Duke Memo.  As professionals with a wealth of \nexperience screening and representing DACA applicants, PIOs nevertheless have few \nalternatives to offer most of their clients, who have lost or are at risk of losing their abilities to \ncontinue working, learning and caring for and supporting themselves and their families.  See \nLSO Br. 3–12.  The services that PIOs are able to provide under these circumstances are much \nmore limited, and primarily relate to counseling, referrals and advocacy.  However, injunctive \nrelief will allow Dreamers to return to school and/or work and will restore the ability of many \nPIOs to deliver the legal services to Dreamers required to access these opportunities.  \nB.  By the Time the Duke Memo Was Released, It Was Too Late for Many \nDreamers to Apply for or Renew Their DACA  \nAlthough PIOs attempted to counsel their clients in person, via email and through \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 14 of 26 PageID #: 6925\n \n \nemergency hotlines once the Duke Memo was released, they could not provide meaningful \nanswers and assurances to many clients.  For example, they could not help those who were \nineligible for other forms of immigration relief and who were in the process of preparing initial \nDACA applications prior to September 5, 2017 but who suddenly became ineligible to apply as a \nresult of the Duke Memo.  Nor could they assist clients who had been granted DACA but who \nhad not yet renewed their status, acting in reliance upon the one-year filing grace period offered \nby USCIS until the issuance of the Duke Memo.  Without preliminary injunctive relief, these \nclients may never be eligible for a status that would enable them to obtain work authorization, \nenroll in and obtain financial aid for higher education and otherwise live outside of the shadow \nof the threat of removal.  Without preliminary relief, PIOs will likewise be unable to use legal \nresources to improve the lives of Dreamers and their families and better serve immigrant \ncommunities in pursuit of their missions.  \nC.  Given the Arbitrary Rescission of DACA, Dreamers Are Forced to Live in \nFear and Can Be Offered No Meaningful Assurances from PIOs  \nBased on USCIS’s recent guidance, PIOs are no longer able to assure their clients that \ninformation they had already provided to the federal government in order to obtain DACA would \nnot be used in removal proceedings against them or their family members.  See Press Release, \nUSCIS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission Of Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA) (Sept. 5, 2017), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/frequently-asked-questions-\nrescission-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca.  See also LSO Br. at 12 n.26 (DACA \nrecipients are at higher risk of deportation because they provided personal information to the \ngovernment as part of the DACA application process). \nMany PIOs believe that their inability to give such assurances also caused a reduction in \nthe number of DACA clients willing to take advantage of the legal services offered by PIOs.  As \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 15 of 26 PageID #: 6926\n \n \nnoted above, the Duke Memo provided one month for those with DACA expiring between \nSeptember 5, 2017 through March 5, 2018 to submit renewal applications, so PIOs attempted to \nmeet demand by holding all-day legal clinics, where individuals interested and/or eligible to \nrenew their DACA could receive in-person assistance completing and filing their applications.  \nIn the experiences of many of the amici, some of these legal clinics were not filled, much less \nover-subscribed, and stood in stark contrast to the experiences of PIOs after the release of the \n2012 DACA Memo, where PIOs could not meet the overwhelming demand for assistance.  \nBased on conversations with community members, PIOs believe that this lack of demand is \npartly attributable to the very short timeframe available for outreach but also to fears surrounding \nthe rescission of DACA and hostility toward immigrants under the Trump administration.  See \nThird Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89-100, Batalla Vidal, ECF No. 113.  See also LSO Br. at 12–17 \n(recognizing that the current political climate has led to fear in immigrant communities, as well \nas a corresponding reluctance to access public services such as medical care and law \nenforcement).  As a result of well-founded fears in immigrant communities, DACA clients \notherwise eligible to renew their status likely did not take advantage of services that could have \nresulted in at least a short-term extension of their DACA.  The only remedy for such clients is \npreliminary injunctive relief, which will, in turn, allow PIOs to dispel any unreasonable fears in \nimmigrant communities, lead to an increase in the uptake of free- or low-cost legal services and \nallow PIOs once again to provide the services that lead to material improvements for Dreamers \nand their families.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 16 of 26 PageID #: 6927\n \n \nII.  The Rescission of DACA Has Caused and Will Continue to Cause Irreparable \nHarm to PIOs Themselves  \n \nA.  The Duke Memo Required PIOs to Devote Much More Time and Attention \nto Addressing the Needs of DACA Clients at the Expense of Other Clients  \n \nPIOs are accustomed to adapting to changing legal landscapes, but the changes \nintroduced by the Duke Memo were unprecedented and continue to cause ongoing harm.  When \nDACA was first announced, PIOs shifted resources to assisting as many qualifying immigrants \nas possible to obtain DACA.  The private bar, bar associations and law schools likewise worked \nto get the word out and assist Dreamers.  As those same clients became eligible for renewal of \ntheir DACA or work authorization, PIOs in the ordinary course of business engaged in outreach \nefforts to ensure that Dreamers were aware of upcoming deadlines and would be in a position to \nrenew their DACA, including assembling the necessary paperwork and fees, on time.  This also \nallowed PIOs to organize their outreach efforts for DACA clients and balance the needs of \nDACA clients against other matters.  In contrast, the arbitrary nature of the policies announced in \nthe Duke Memo—the extraordinarily short renewal period, combined with the failure to notify \naffected individuals of all of the processes that would guide the adjudication of renewal \nsubmissions—have meant that PIOs are struggling to pursue their work in an orderly and \nefficient fashion and efforts to pursue their mission of serving their communities to the fullest \nextent possible are being limited for reasons beyond their control. \nPIOs were forced to make difficult choices in allocating their scarce resources upon the \nissuance of the Duke Memo.  Many PIOs have limited staff with a wide range of responsibilities, \nincluding but not limited to immigration services, and therefore PIOs had to triage among DACA \nclients and other matters.  The only option for many PIOs was to put on hold non-DACA cases \nthat did not need immediate attention and return to those matters after October 5, 2017.  For \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 17 of 26 PageID #: 6928\n \n \nexample, PIOs postponed client appointments or scheduled them for later dates, and attorneys \nand paralegals deferred drafting, research and advocacy on other issues until after October 5, \n2017. \nSmaller and less well-resourced organizations struggled under existing caseloads, \nincluding cases that could not be delayed.  Some PIOs coped with the demand for assistance with \nDACA by referring non-DACA clients elsewhere at the expense of those client relationships.  \nPIOs are also concerned that their inability to help all individuals, precisely at the time when \nthose individuals turned to PIOs for assistance, has eroded the trust and confidence of their \ncommunities and undermined PIOs’ ability to serve them in the future. \nMoreover, large and small PIOs alike were pressed to conduct outreach and thoroughly \ncounsel clients in an unprecedented, short timeframe,4 and had to engage in time-consuming \ncounseling sessions in order to screen former DACA candidates for alternative forms of \naffirmative immigration status.  For example, attorneys for The Legal Aid Society spent \napproximately thirty minutes to an hour screening each DACA client for eligibility for other \nforms of relief.  \nFear and distrust generated by the Duke Memo compounded these challenges, as \n                                                 \n4   Moreover, the arbitrary, 30-day renewal timetable contrasts with deadlines for other forms of immigration \nrelief.  See, e.g., Extension and Redesignation of the Republic of Yemen for Temporary Protected Status, 82 Fed. \nReg. 859, 859 (Jan. 4, 2017); Extension of the Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 82 Fed. Reg. \n23,830, 23,830 (May 24, 2017).  For example, temporary protected status (“TPS”) temporarily defers removal and \ngrants work authorization to citizens of countries where repatriation is unsafe or unworkable.  When USCIS has \nrescinded TPS status for certain countries, it has provided twelve months’ notice from the current designation, plus a \n60-day re-registration period, in order “[t]o provide for an orderly transition.”  Termination of the Designation of \nSudan for Temporary Protected Status, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,228, 47,228 (Oct. 11, 2017).  DACA, on the other hand, was \nrescinded with only six months’ notice following the end of the current designation, plus a 30-day renewal period.  \nIn addition, USCIS typically permits TPS applicants to re-submit applications that were submitted before the \ndeadline and rejected for technical reasons, which contrasts with USCIS’s refusal to allow the resubmission of \nDACA applications rejected for technical reasons, except for selected applicants affected by USPS error.  See, e.g., \nDesignation of Nepal for Temporary Protected Status, 80 Fed. Reg. 36,346, 36,348 (June 24, 2015) (permitting \napplicants who filed application forms before the deadline and were denied a fee waiver by USCIS fewer than 45 \ndays before the filing deadline to re-file the application within the 45-day period after the date of USCIS’s fee \nwaiver denial notice).   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 18 of 26 PageID #: 6929\n \n \notherwise eligible individuals became reluctant to access legal services or provide information to \nUSCIS.  For example, college counselors and social workers called The Legal Society with \nquestions on behalf of DACA applicants too afraid to meet with staff and volunteers from a legal \nservices organization.  Accordingly, PIOs in some cases had to liaise with intermediaries before \nthey could even reach affected individuals by the rescission of DACA. \nB.  Even Clients Who Met the October 5, 2017 Deadline Were Wrongly or \nOtherwise Improperly Denied Relief, Putting an Extraordinary Burden on \nPIOs \nDespite the difficult circumstances following the arbitrary rescission of DACA and the \nfears it generated among clients, PIOs were able to submit many applications for renewed \nDACA by the October 5, 2017 deadline.  However, some of these applications were nevertheless \nwrongly rejected or rejected without any credible or justifiable basis.  For example, the Duke \nMemo did not specify a cutoff time for receipt of applications on the date of the renewal deadline \n(itself a departure from past USCIS practice, which only required applications to be postmarked \nby the published deadline, not physically received by that deadline).  See, e.g., USCIS Reminds \nSyrians to Register for Temporary Protected Status, USCIS (Sept. 25, 2012), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-news/uscis-reminds-syrians-register-temporary-protected-\nstatus; see also Press Release, USCIS, Frequently Asked Questions - #2: Employment-Based \nAdjustment Applications (July 27, 2007), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/ \npressrelease/FAQ2.pdf.  In the absence of a specified cutoff time, it is common sense—and \nconsistent with past practice—for USCIS to accept applications until 11:59 p.m. on the day of \nany deadline.  See, e.g., INS Issues Final Regulations for HRIFA, Immigration & Naturalization \nServs. (Mar. 21, 2000), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/ \nFinalRegsHRIFA_032100.pdf.  Indeed, the government has admitted in this case that “USCIS \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 19 of 26 PageID #: 6930\n \n \napplied a deadline of 11:59 PM on October 5, 2017.”  Letter from Defendants to Judge Garaufis \nEx. 4 at 1, Batalla Vidal, ECF No. 106.  However, some applications received at designated \nUSCIS post office boxes after 6:00 p.m. but before 11:59 p.m. were rejected as untimely with no \njustification by USCIS. \nMoreover, USCIS’s post hoc attempts to remedy certain rejections—a response to \nadvocacy efforts by PIOs5—were wholly inadequate.  First, USCIS’s attempts to date cast too \nnarrow of a net.  For instance, they do not necessarily allow all applications that were received \non October 5, 2017 before 11:59 p.m. and were nevertheless rejected by USCIS to be re-filed,6 \nmeaning that PIOs need to continue devoting resources to challenging USCIS’s arbitrary and \nunreasonable conduct.  \n                                                 \n5   Even after learning that USPS error affected over seventy applicants, USCIS initially took the position that \napplicants were responsible for the method of delivery selected by them.  See Liz Robbins, Post Office Fails to \nDeliver on Time, and DACA Applications Get Rejected, N.Y. Times (Nov. 10, 2017), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/nyregion/post-office-mail-delays-daca-applications.html.  It was only after \nsignificant advocacy by PIOs and congressional intervention that USCIS altered its position.  See, e.g., Letter from \nMartin Heinrich, U.S. Sen. for N.M., et al. to Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec’y of Homeland Sec. (Nov. 15, 2017), \nhttps://www.heinrich.senate.gov/download/letter-to-dhs-on-daca-application-delays; Liz Robbins, In Reversal, \nImmigration Agency Will Consider Delayed DACA Requests, N.Y. Times (Nov. 15, 2017), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/nyregion/uscis-immigration-daca-requests.html. \n \nOn November 15, 2017, USCIS acknowledged USPS error and asked applicants to await further \nguidance.  Alert: USCIS Guidance on DACA Renewal Requests Affected by Mail Service Issues, USCIS, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-guidance-daca-renewal-requests-affected-mail-service-issues (last updated \nNov. 30, 2017).  Despite promising to publish detailed guidance on November 20, 2017, USCIS did not post \nadditional details until November 30, 2017.  See Q&A.  When it posted the Q&A, USCIS acknowledged that over \n900 applications had been affected by USPS error.  Liz Robbins, Number of DACA Applications Stuck in the Mail \nTops 900, N.Y. Times (Nov. 30, 2017), https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/nyregion/daca-applications-\nimmigrants.html. \n \nUnder this guidance, USCIS will individually reach out to applicants whom they unilaterally have deemed \nto be affected by USPS error.  See Q&A.  Those lucky enough to receive an invitation to apply for reconsideration \nwill have thirty-three days to respond.  Id.  Meanwhile, the DACA of many of these same individuals has expired, \nand USCIS has refused to make retroactive the limited number of renewals it grants.  Id.  Once their DACA expires, \nindividuals accrue “unlawful presence,” which can result in strict time-bars to reentering the United States.  See LSO \nBr. at 8–9.  Additionally, lack of retroactivity forces employers to terminate these individuals, even while they await \nrenewal decisions. \n \n6   See Q&A (“If you identify a clear error by USCIS in the processing of your renewal request, USCIS may \nexercise its discretion to review your request again.”). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 20 of 26 PageID #: 6931\n \n \nSecond, the guidance that USCIS has provided on wrongly rejected applicants whom it \nwill invite to reapply is vague.  Without clear information from USCIS regarding the criteria it \nwill apply in reconsidering rejected applications, the legal community does not know which \ncases will be automatically resolved by USCIS based on any applicable criteria and which cases \nwill require individual advocacy (for matters that, for example, do not clearly fall under \napplicable criteria but may nevertheless still qualify for reconsideration).  Unable to rely on \npublished agency protocols to advise their clients, PIOs have been forced to advocate on their \nclients’ behalves using inefficient means and must dedicate outsize resources for every single \ncase. \nC.  PIOs Now Have to Help Dreamers Who Lost Their DACA Meet Basic Needs  \nBecause former DACA recipients have in many cases lost gainful employment, PIOs \nnow must spend time and resources providing or referring former DACA candidates to \ncommunity-based organizations for help, such as food pantries, free clinics and organizations \nthat offer cash grants, which in turn strains limited charitable resources and diverts them to \npeople who—but for USCIS’s arbitrary conduct—did not previously need such support.  \nD.  PIOs Will Lose Valuable Staff \nMany amici PIOs are leanly staffed, have invested considerable time and resources in \ntraining their employees and stand to lose valuable team members solely as a result of the \narbitrary rescission of DACA.  Because their Dreamer employees will lose their work \nauthorization, many of the amici will be forced to lay off valuable employees.  For example, \nthirty percent of the staff of South Bronx United are DACA recipients. \nThe loss of DACA staff undermines the ability of the amici to fully serve their \ncommunities.  The Dreamer staff of amici PIOs have the desirable language skills and cultural \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 21 of 26 PageID #: 6932\n \n \ncompetency to work with immigrant communities and are therefore uniquely suited to leverage \ntheir experiences, knowledge, existing networks and trust of their communities to reach and meet \nthe needs of immigrants, including vulnerable and marginalized people.  For example, Immigrant \nJustice Corps regularly grants fellowships to DACA recipients, who are then trained to work as \nimmigrant specialists in PIOs and other community based organizations and become future \nleaders in immigration and other legal services.  Without DACA, such Dreamer fellows and \ngraduates of the program will be unable to put their skills, training and experience to use in their \ncommunities.  Thus, the rescission of DACA forces the amici to lay off their DACA staff, \nreduces the already limited amount of free and low-cost legal services available and undermines \nthe ability of the amici to carry out their missions.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Duke Memo impedes the ability of the undersigned amici \nto serve their communities, overburdens the scarce resources of PIOs to provide no- or low-cost \nlegal aid and imposes a direct harm on their clients and employees, many of whom are DACA \nrecipients.  Accordingly, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ request for provisional relief. \n   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 171   Filed 12/22/17   Page 22 of 26 PageID #: 6933\nDated: December 22, 2017 \nNew York, New York \nRespectfully submitted, \nnathan S.

On July 28, \n2020, Defendant Chad F.

Trump,  17-cv-5228,1 moved for leave to challenge the \nmemorandum on the grounds (1) that Mr. Wolf was not lawfully \nserving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and therefore \ndid not have authority to issue the memorandum; and (2) that \nthe memorandum was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").

(See States' Mem. at 15, \nn. 9.) \nI.   BACKGROUND \nThe court assumes familiarity with the DACA program, the re \nscission of which it enjoined, on APA grounds, in an earlier phase \nof this litigation in February 2018. See  291  F.  Supp.  3d 260 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2018). The Supreme Court reviewed that order and af \nfirmed its reasoning under the APA, along with similar decisions \nof other district courts, in Dep't of Homeland Security v. Regents of \nthe Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020). In the wake of the \nRegents decision, Mr. Wolf suspended portions of the DACA pro \ngram and made certain other amendments to the program via a \nmemorandum (the \"Wolf Memorandum\") issued in July 2020. \n(See  Wolf Memorandum ('Wolf Mem.\")  (Dkt.  297-1) at 1-2.) \nSpecifically, Mr. Wolf instructed DHS personnel to (1) reject all \npending and future initial requests for DACA; (2) reject all pend \ning and future applications for advance parole-necessary for \nDACA recipients to leave and re-enter the United States-absent \nexceptional circumstances; and (3) require DACA recipients to \nrenew their status under the program annually rather than every \ntwo years. (See WolfMem. at 1-2, 5.) \nThe question before the court is whether Mr. Wolf was lawfully \nserving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security when he issued \nthe Wolf Memorandum, or if any subsequent action taken cured \nits alleged deficiencies. There are five agency actions primarily \nrelevant to the court's analysis and discussed below. The first \nthree are amendments to DHS's order of succession made (or at \ntempted) in February, April, and November of 2019. The fourth \nis the issuance of the Wolf Memorandum in July 2020. The fifth \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 4 of 31 PageID #: 14899\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 5 of 31 PageID #: 14900\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 6 of 31 PageID #: 14901\npm, Secretary Nielsen tweeted that she would remain as Secre \ntary until April10, 2019. \nOn April9, Secretary Nielsen signed a Memorandum from John \nMitnick, DHS's General Counsel, titled \"Designation of an Order \nof Succession to the Secretary,\" explicitly approving the docu \nment attached  (the \"April Delegation\").  (See  Memorandum of \nJohn Mitnick (\"Mitnick Memorandum\") (Dkt. 324-1) at ECF p. \n2.) The April Delegation amended Annex A, such that the order \nof succession under it was, as relevant: (1) the Deputy Secretary; \n(2)  the  Under Secretary for  Management;  (3)  CBP  Commis \nsioner;  (4 )  FEMA  Administrator;  and  (5)  Director  of  the \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\"CISA\"). (Id . \nat ECF p. 3.) Immediately thereafter, Ms. Grady announced that \nshe would resign as Under Secretary. (56.1 Resp. 'I 21.) Thus, \nunder the modified Annex A, Commissioner McAleenan would \nhave been the lawful Acting Secretary, in line with the President's \nannouncement, because both the Deputy Secretary and Under \nSecretary positions were vacant. However, the April Delegation \ndid not change when Annex A,  rather than E.O.  13753, gov \nerned. Annex A was, at that point, still only applicable in the \nevent of the Secretary's unavailability during a disaster or cata \nstrophic  emergency. 5  Under  E.O.  13753,  Christopher  Krebs, \nDirector of CISA, would have been the Acting Secretary because \nthe office of the FEMA Administrator was also vacant. (I d. '1'1 28-\n30.) On April 10, Secretary Nielsen and Under Secretary Grady \nofficially resigned, and Mr. McAleenan began to perform the du \nties of Acting Secretary. (Id. '1'120-22.) \n5 The Government maintains that the April Delegation changed the order \nof succession in all cases. The court disagrees, for reasons discussed below. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 7 of 31 PageID #: 14902\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 8 of 31 PageID #: 14903\nsurvive even if DACA's second pillar, eligibility for federal bene \nfits, violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, as the Fifth \nCircuit held in Texas v. United States, 809 F .3d 134, 181-182 (5th \nCir. 2015). Second, the Court held that the Duke Memorandum \nfailed to consider the reliance interests that the DACA program \nengendered in the five years it was operable, prior to the Trump \nAdministration's attempt to rescind it. See Regents, 140 S. Ct. at \n1915. \nWith the rescission vacated, Plaintiffs argued that DHS was obli \ngated to fully reinstate the DACA program, without delay. (See \nPls.' Letter of July 21, 2020 (Dkt. 295).) Instead, Mr. Wolf, pur \nportedly  in  his  capacity  as  Acting  Secretary,  issued  a  new \nmemorandum on July 28,2020 (the \"Wolf Memorandum\"). (See \nMem.  of Chad Wolf (\"Wolf Mem.\")  (Dkt.  297-1).) The Wolf \nMemorandum directed DHS to \"reject all pending and future in \nitial  requests  for  DACA,  to  reject  all  pending  and  future \napplications  for  advance  parole  absent  'exceptional  circum \nstances,' and to shorten DACA renewals\" from two years to one \nyear, pending DHS's \"thorough consideration of how to address \nDACA in light of the Supreme Court's decision.\" (Wolf Mem. at \n1-2.) Soon after, Plaintiffs informed the court of their intention \nto move for summary judgment on the  theory that the Wolf \nMemorandum was void ab initio because Mr. Wolf was not law \nfully serving as Acting Secretary and that it violated the APA \nbecause it was arbitrary and capricious. (See Pls.' Letter of Aug. \n6, 2020 (Dkt. 302).) The court directed the parties to begin by \nbriefing their cross motions for partial summary judgment on \nwhether Mr. Wolf had lawful authority to issue the Wolf Memo \nrandum. (See  Scheduling Order.) Meanwhile, the Government \nAccountability Office  (\"GAO\")  reported to Congress on August \n14, 2020 that Mr. Wolf was named to his position \"by reference \nto an invalid order of succession\" and referred to the Inspector \nGeneral of DHS the question of who should be serving as Acting \nSecretary and what the fate should be of actions taken by Mr. \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 9 of 31 PageID #: 14904\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 10 of 31 PageID #: 14905\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 11 of 31 PageID #: 14906\nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.   Relevant Statutes \n1.   Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) \nThe Federal Vacancies Reform Act (\"FVRA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et \nseq., replaced the Vacancies Act in 1998. See Pub. L. 105-277, § \n151, 112 Stat. 2681(1998); NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, \n936 (2017). As the Supreme Court has explained, relying largely \non the expertise of Morton Rosenberg who has submitted an ami \ncus brief in this case, the FVRA was a response to a perceived \n\"threat to the Senate's advice and consent power.\" SW Gen., 137 \nS. Ct. at 936. At the time of passage, approximately 20 percent \nof offices requiring a Presidential appointment and Senate con \nfirmation (\"PAS\" offices) were held by temporary designees who \nhad been in office beyond the Vacancies Act's 120-day limit. Id. \nIn the decades before Congress adopted the FVRA, the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel took the position that the \n\"housekeeping\" statutes of individual agencies provided agency \nheads \"independent authority apart from the Vacancies Act to \ntemporarily fill vacant offices.\" Id. at 935; see also Amicus Br. of \nMorton Rosenberg (\"Rosenberg Br.\")  (Dkt.  317- 1)  at 3. In re \nsponse, the FVRA provides \"the exclusive means for temporarily \nauthorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties \nof any office of an Executive agency ... for which appointment \nis required to be made by the President, by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\" 5 U.S. C. § 3347(a). The terms of the \nFVRA apply unless (1) an express statutory provision either \"(A) \nauthorizes the President, a court, or the head of an Executive de \npartment, to designate an officer or employee to perform the \nfunctions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting \ncapacity; or (B) designates an officer or employee to perform the \nfunctions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting \ncapacity;\" or (2) the President fills a vacancy with a recess ap \npointment. Id. \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 12 of 31 PageID #: 14907\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 13 of 31 PageID #: 14908\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 14 of 31 PageID #: 14909\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 15 of 31 PageID #: 14910\n(b) (1), if an acting officer fails to serve \"in accordance with sec \ntions  3345,  3346,  and  3347,\" then \"the  office  shall  remain \nvacant.\" 5 U.S. C.§ 3348(b) (1). And an \"action taken by any per \nson who is not acting under section 3345, 3346, or 3347  ... shall \nhave no force or effect.\" \nThus, according to the plain text of Section 3347 , a statutory pro \nvision that expressly \"authorizes ... the head of an Executive \ndepartment[] to designate an officer or employee to perform the \nfunctions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting \ncapacity,\" displaces Sections 3345 and 3346, and necessarily dis \nplaces the limitations and enforcement mechanisms associated \ntherewith. Here, the HSA constitutes such a provision, as it au \nthorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"designate such \nother officers of the Department in further order of succession to \nserve as Acting Secretary'' beyond the Deputy Secretary and Un \nder Secretary for  Management,  who are  \"first  assistants\" for \nFVRA purposes. See 6 U.S.C.  § 113(g). Although the HSA ex \npressly invokes the FVRA to designate the Deputy Secretary and \nUnder Secretary for Management as \"first assistants,\" it also ex \npressly grants the Secretary the power, should the \"first assistant\" \noffices both be vacant, to designate the \"further order of succes \nsion\" notwithstanding the FVRA. See S. W.  Gen.,  137 S.Ct. at 939 \n(explaining that the \"ordinary meaning of'notwithstanding' is 'in \nspite of,' or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by\"). \nMr. Wolf assumed the Acting Secretary role because he was Un \nder Secretary for  Strategy, Policy,  and  Plans  and,  under the \nNovember Delegation, fourth in line to assume the role behind \nthe Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary for Management, and \nthe CBP Commissioner, which were all vacant at the time. There \nfore,  reading the  statutes together,  Mr.  Wolf was designated \npursuant to the Secretary's power under the HSA, notwithstand \ning the FVRA, to designate further succession beyond the \"first \nassistants\" who exist under the auspices of the FVRA.  Because \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 16 of 31 PageID #: 14911\nMr. Wolf did not assume the Acting Secretary role under Section \n3345, Sections 3346 and 3348 do not apply to him. See Casa de \nMaryland, 2020 WL 5500165 at *18; Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr., \n2020 WL 5798269 at *10-11.9 \n9 A plain reading of the statutory text produces a counterintuitive result: a \n210-day limitation on the acting service of the Deputy Secretary and the \nUnder Secretary for Management, who are designated by statute, but no \nlimitation on those further down the line of succession, designated by the \nSecretary. The Casa de Maryland court surmised that perhaps Congress \nwished \"to instill continuity in the functioning of the agency\" in cases \nwhere DHS's top leadership positions were all vacant. Casa de Maryland, \n2020 WL 5500165 at *19. Whatever the case, the court must \"interpret the \nstatute as it was written, not [] rewrite it as [Plaintiffs] believe Congress \ncould have intended to write it.\" Palisades Collections UC v.  Shorts, 552 \nF.3d 327, 336 (4th Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original). \nTo be sure, allowing acting officers to serve without time limitations and \nother enforcement mechanisms raises  serious  constitutional  concerns. \n'The 'manipulation of official appointments' had long been one of the \nAmerican revolutionary generation's greatest grievances against executive \npower because 'the power of appointment to offices' was deemed 'the most \ninsidious and powerful weapon of eighteenth century despotism.\"' Freytag \nv. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 883 (1991), quoting Gordon \nWood, The Creation of The American Republic 1776-1787, p. 79 (1969) \n(internal citation omitted). As of November 14, 2020, it has been nearly \n600 days since the Department of Homeland Security was led by a Senate \nconfirmed Secretary. (See 56.1 Resp.l[ 17.) President Trump has validated \nconcerns about the effects of circumventing the appointments process by \nsaying of PAS vacancies: \"I'm in no hurry ... I have 'acting' [sic]. And my \n'actings' are doing really great. I sort of like 'acting.' It gives me more flex \nibility.\" (ld.  -J 11.) Without the time limitations of the FVRA, it could be \npossible to install a series of acting officers in order to avoid constitution \nally required Senate approval. \nOne possible solution, offered by Plaintiffs, is to construe the power to issue \nfurther orders of succession under the HSA to reside only with a Senate \nconfirmed \"Secretary'' and not with \"Acting Secretaries.\" (See Pls.' Reply at \n13.) The Nw. Immigrant Rights Project court reached that conclusion when \nconsidering the likelihood of success on the merits on an application for a \npreliminary injunction: \"based on the text, structure, and purpose of the \nstatute, the Court reads § 113(g) (2) as vesting in only the PAS Secretary \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 17 of 31 PageID #: 14912\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 18 of 31 PageID #: 14913\n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 19 of 31 PageID #: 14914\nE.O. 13753 with Annex A in Section II.A. in the November Dele \ngation is strong evidence that E.O. 13753 was the operative law \nat the time, and therefore that Mr. McAleenan was without au \nthority to make the amendment. (See November Delegation at \nECF p. 16.) Accordingly, Mr. Wolf did not possess statutory au \nthority  when  he  assumed  the  role  of  Acting  Secretary  in \nNovember 2019. See Casa de Maryland, 2020 WL 5500165 at \n1'23; Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr. 2020 WL 5798269 at *9; GAO De \ncision at ECF p. 175. \nThe Government Defendants now contend that the April Delega \ntion meant something other than what it says. They argue that \nSecretary Nielsen signed only the April9, 2019 Memorandum of \nDHS  General  Counsel John Mitnick,  in  which  she  stated,  \"I \nhereby designate the order of succession for  the  Secretary of \nHomeland Security'' (see Mitnick Memorandum at ECF pp. 2-3) \nand that, therefore, Annex A should apply to vacancies, which \nimplicate the \"order of succession\" that Secretary Nielsen sought \nto change. In their view, under the two tracks of the February \nDelegation, E.O. 13753 supplied the \"order of succession\" in the \ncase of a vacancy, and Annex A supplied the order for \"delega \ntions of authority,\" relevant in the case of emergencies. (See Gov't \nOpp. at 9.) According to the Government, amending Annex A \nwas actually intended to alter the order of succession in all cases, \nnot just the delegations of authority covered by Annex A.  (See \nGov't Opp. at 7.) As further evidence, the Government offers a \nsworn  declaration  from  Associate  General  Counsel  Neal  J. \nSwartz, from June 2020, in which he states that Annex A,  as \namended by Secretary Nielsen in April 2019, \"controlled the suc \ncession order for every vacancy in the office of the Secretary, no \nmatter the reason for the vacancy.\" (Decl. of Neal J. Swartz (Dkt. \n324-1) at ECF p. 6.) Therefore, the Government urges the court \nto ignore official agency policy documents and invalidate the \nplain text of the April Delegation because it does not comport \nwith her supposed intent, although it comports perfectly with the \n19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 20 of 31 PageID #: 14915\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 21 of 31 PageID #: 14916\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 22 of 31 PageID #: 14917\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 23 of 31 PageID #: 14918\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 24 of 31 PageID #: 14919\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 25 of 31 PageID #: 14920\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 26 of 31 PageID #: 14921\nó\n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 27 of 31 PageID #: 14922\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 28 of 31 PageID #: 14923\n    \n    \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 29 of 31 PageID #: 14924\n \n \n \n \n \n    \n    \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 30 of 31 PageID #: 14925\n \n \nprima facie \n \nExcluded \nprima facie \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-VMS   Document 304   Filed 11/14/20   Page 31 of 31 PageID #: 14926\n ",

Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Security, 284 F.Supp.3d \n758 (2018). After the Government filed petitions for certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that \ndecision and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and capricious.

Post, at 1934 – 1936 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). \nBut he cites no authority limiting this basic principle—which the Court regularly articulates in the context of \nrulemakings—to adjudications. The Government does not even raise this unheralded argument. \n \n4  The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke also focused on litigation risk. Although the background \n  section of her memo references a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge DACA, the memo \nnever asserts that the rescission was intended to avert litigation. And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that \nthe policy was unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or defended in its current form—it is \ndifficult to see how the risk of litigation carried any independent weight. \n \n5  As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits because they had \n  been designated “lawfully present.” Texas, 809 F.3d at 168. Lawful presence is a statutory prerequisite for receipt of \ncertain benefits. See id., at 148 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1611). It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexorably \nfrom forbearance. Thus, while deferred action recipients have been designated lawfully present for purposes of \nSocial Security and Medicare eligibility, see 8 CFR § 1.3; 42 CFR § 417.422(h), agencies can also exclude them from \nthis designation, see 45 CFR § 152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that DACA recipients are not considered lawfully present \nfor purposes of coverage under the Affordable Care Act). \n28 \n \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security v.

See 8 CFR § 1.3(a)(4)(vi); see also 42 CFR § \n417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR § 1.3). Thus, DHS could have addressed the Attorney General’s determination \nthat such benefits were impermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR § 1.3 to exclude DACA recipients from \nthose benefits without rescinding the DACA Memorandum and the forbearance policy it established. But Duke’s \nrescission memo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n7  Our affirmance of the NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it unnecessary to examine the propriety of the \n  nationwide scope of the injunctions issued by the District Courts in Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n1  I concur in the judgment insofar as the majority rejects respondents’ equal protection claim. \n   \n2  See Immigrant Children’s Educational Advancement and Dropout Prevention Act of 2001, H.

Lopez, Pew Research Center, Up to 1.7 Million Unauthorized Immigrant Youth May Benefit From \n  New Deportation Rules (Aug. 14, 2012). \n \n4  The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful permanent residence status. See § 1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) \n  (two years for spouses to demonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of procuring an \nalien’s admission as an immigrant”); § 1186b (qualifying business entrepreneurs). \n \n5  For instance, Congress has carved out rules for aliens who served in the Armed Forces, §§ 1438–1440, and alien \n  spouses who have been subject to domestic abuse, §§ 1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n \n6  In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action programs have been implemented by the Executive \n  Branch without explicit legislation. But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive] power.’ ” Medellín v. \nTexas, 552 U.S. 491, 532, 128 S.Ct. 1346, 170 L.Ed.2d 190 (2008) (quoting Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, \n686, 101 S.Ct. 2972, 69 L.Ed.2d 918 (1981)). If any of these programs had been challenged, it would seem that they \nwould be legally infirm for the same reasons as DACA. Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create new categories \nof aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ deferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise. \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, and Congress is no closer to a legislative \nsolution than it was in 2012. See, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H. R. 6, 116th Cong., 1st Sess. \n \n7  It is uncontested that deferred action frequently occurs on a case-by-case basis, often justified on the grounds that \n  the agency lacks resources to remove all removable aliens. Even assuming that these ad hoc exercises of discretion \nare permissible, however, we have stated that “[a]n agency confronting resource constraints may change its own \n29 \n \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security v.

EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 327, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 \nL.Ed.2d 372 (2014). \n \n8  The majority tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must. See ante, at 1906 – 1907. Otherwise, the majority would \n  have to accept that DACA was nothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make its \nrescission unreviewable. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). \n \n9  As  I  have  previously  pointed  out,  “the  APA  actually  contemplated  a  much  more  formal  process  for  most \n  rulemaking.” Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. 92, 128, n. 5, 135 S.Ct. 1199, 191 L.Ed.2d 186 (2015) \n(opinion concurring in judgment). \n \n10  The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment rulemaking. For example, an agency may \n  promulgate a legally binding rule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so. 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B). \nThis text would become a nullity if the agency could achieve the same effect by simply dispensing with notice and \ncomment procedures altogether. \n \n11  Thus, it is not that the APA “should not” be construed to support the majority’s result, ante, at 1914 (emphasis \n  added), it is that the APA does not and cannot support that result. \n \n12  I express no view on what other reasons would justify an agency’s decision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action. \n  I merely point out that correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n \n13  In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immigration laws and had complied with the APA, it \n  would  still  violate  the  Constitution  as  an  impermissible  delegation  of  legislative  power.  See  Department  of \nTransportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U.S. 43, 77, 135 S.Ct. 1225, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015) \n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Putting aside this constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment \nprocess at least attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some of the sting out of the inherently \nundemocratic and unaccountable rulemaking process. Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51 Admin. \nL. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n \n14  The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly questionable. Because a grant of deferred action \n  renders DACA recipients eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from clear that the Department \ncould separate DACA’s “forbearance component” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet \nanother APA problem. The majority points to the fact that, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of \n2010, relevant regulations exclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage. Ante, at 1911, n. 5. \nBut that misses the point. Those regulations were promulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the \nDACA process applie[d]” for those benefits. See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012). By contrast, DACA recipients have been \neligible for and have received Medicare, Social Security, and work authorization for years. DHS therefore is not \nwriting on a blank slate. Under the majority’s rule, DHS would need to amend all relevant regulations and explain \nwhy all recipients of deferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer receive them. \nAlternatively and perhaps more problematically, it would need to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred \naction should continue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not. It thus seems highly likely that the majority’s \nproposed course of action would be subject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n \n15  The majority contends that this argument does not carry force because the rescission implemented a winddown \n  period during which recipients would continue to receive benefits. But whether DHS’ decision to wind down DACA \nwas lawful is a separate question from whether DHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing \nan unlawful program. \n \n16  The majority’s approach will make it far more difficult to change deferred-action programs going forward, which is \n  hardly in keeping with this Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in administrative \n30 \n \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security v. Regents of the..., 140 S.Ct. 1891 (2020)   \n2020 WL 3271746, 207 L.Ed.2d 353, 20 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 5524... \n \ndiscretion” used for administrative “convenience.” Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, \n484, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999). Agencies will likely be less willing to grant deferred action knowing that \nany attempts to undo it will require years of litigation and time-consuming rulemakings. \n \n1  Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not \n  consider whether its prosecutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” and therefore \nnot subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the first place. 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). Several judges have \nadvanced arguments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an exercise of forbearance \nauthority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions about whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion against a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable under the APA as “committed to \nagency discretion by law.” Ibid.; see Casa De Maryland v.

Defendants have moved to dismiss\nthese cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (See Defs. Mot.\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 2 of 48 PageID #: 3796\nto Dismiss( Dkt. 95)^; Defs. Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs. Mem.\")( Dkt. 95-\n1).) For the reasons that follow, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART\nDefendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and RESERVES RULING\non Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe court begins by providing some background on the DACA program, the steps\nDefendants have taken to end it, and the increasingly complicated procedural history of these\ncases.\nA. Factual Background\n1. Deferred Action\nThe DACA program originates in a mismatch between the number of individuals\nunlawfully present in the United States and DHS's ability to remove these individuals from the\ncountry. As of 2014,f or example, approximately 11.3 million removable individuals were\npresent in the United States.^ (The Department of Homeland Security's Authority to Prioritize\nRemoval of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of\nOthers, 38 Op. O.L.C. at 1 (2014)( \"OLC Op.\")( Admin. R.( \"AR\")( Dkt. 77-1) at 4).) DHS has\nthe resources to remove only a small percentage of these individuals—specifically, about\n400,000 per year, or less than four percent of the total, as of 2014. (Id. at 1; DHS,2 015\n'E xcept as noted, all docket citations refer to the docket in Batalla Vidal v. Duke. No. 16-CV-4756 (E.D.N.Y.).\nFor convenience, the court refers to the Plaintiffs in Batalla Vidal v. Duke as the \"Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs\"; Plaintiff\nMake the Road New York as \"MRNY\";t he Plaintiffs in New York v. Trump. No. 17-CV-5228 (E.D.N.Y.), as the\n\"State Plaintiffs\"; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as \"DHS\"; U.S. Customs and Border Protection as\n\"GBP\"; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as \"USCIS\"; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as\n\"ICE\"; and the U.S. Department of Justice as \"DOJ.\"\n^ \"Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or\nmeet other criteria set by federal law.\" Arizona v. United States. 567 U.S. 387, 396( 2012)( citing 8 U.S.C. § 1227).\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 3 of 48 PageID #: 3797\nYearbook of Immigration Statistics tbl. 39( 2016)( listing 333,341 removals and 129,122\n\"returns\" for the year 2015).) Because of the \"practical fact\" that it cannot deport all these\nindividuals, the Executive Branch has significant discretion to prioritize the removal of some and\nto deprioritize the removal of others.  Arpaio v. Obama. 797 F.3d 11,16( D.C. Cir. 2015).\n\"One form of discretion the Secretary of Homeland Security exercises is 'deferred\naction,' which entails temporarily postponing the removal of individuals unlawfully present in\nthe United States.\" Id \"Deferred action,\" sometimes referred to as \"nonpriority status,\" is \"in\neffect, an informal administrative stay of deportation,\" Lennon v. INS,5 27 F.2d 187,191 n.7\n(2d Cir. 1975), by which immigration authorities decide not to initiate, or decide to halt, removal\nproceedings \"for humanitarian reasons or simply for.,. convenience,\" Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471,484( 1999)( \"AAADC\"). Immigration authorities have\nused deferred action and similar policies on numerous occasions since at least the early 1960s.\nArpaio. 797 F.3d at 16 (citing OLC Op. at 7-8,12-13). Although deferred action was initially\n\"developed without express statutory authorization,\" AAADC,5 25 U.S. at 484 (quoting 6 C.\nGordon et al.. Immigration Law and Procedure § 72.03(2)(h)( 1998)), it has since been\nreferenced in the Immigration and Nationality Act( \"INA\") and in DHS regulations,^  8  U.S.C.\n§ 1154(a)(l)(D)(i)(ll),( IV)( making certain individuals \"eligible for deferred action and work\nauthorization\"); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.l2(c)(14)( authorizing certain recipients of deferred action to\napply for work authorization).\n2. DACA and DAPA\nIn 2012, the Obama Administration created the DACA program by issuing a\nmemorandum stating that DHS would consider according deferred action to certain\nundocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. (Mem.f rom Janet\nNapolitano, Sec'y of DHS,t o David V. Aguilar, Acting Comm'r, CBP, et al., Exercising\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 4 of 48 PageID #: 3798\nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\n(June 15, 2012)( the \"2012 DACA Memo\")( AR 1).) The 2012 DACA Memo directed CBP,\nUSCIS, and ICE to consider exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals\nwithout lawful immigration status who (1) were under the age of sixteen when they entered the\nUnited States;( 2) had been continuously present in the United States for at least the five years\nleading up to June 15, 2012;( 3) were currently in school, had graduated from high school or\nobtained GEDs, or were honorably discharged veterans;( 4) had not been convicted of felonies,\nsignificant misdemeanors, or multiple misdemeanors, and did not \"otherwise pose[] a threat to\nnational security or public safety\"; and (5) were not above the age of thirty. (Id.) Individuals\nwho met these criteria, passed a background check, and were granted relief\" on a case by case\nbasis\" were shielded from removal and eligible to apply for work authorization, subject to\nrenewal every two years. (Id at 2-3.) The 2012 DACA Memo made clear, however, that it\n\"confer[red] no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship,\" but only \"set\nforth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law.\" (Id at 3.)\nFollowing the issuance of the 2012 DACA Memo, approximately 800,000 individuals have been\ngranted deferred action and work authorization under the program. (Second Am. Compl.\n(\"SAC\")( Dkt. 60)^  73; USCIS, Number of Form 1-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals, by Fiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics and Case Status, Fiscal Year\n2012-2017( June 30,2017)( Am. Compl.( \"State Pis. Am. Compl.\"), Ex. 1 (No. 17-CV-5228,\nDkt. 55-1)).)\nIn 2014, the Obama Administration announced a new deferred action program for the\nparents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, Deferred Action for Parents of\nAmericans and Lawful Permanent Residents( \"DAPA\"). (Mem.f rom Jeh Charles Johnson,\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 5 of 48 PageID #: 3799\nSec'y of DHS,t o Leon Rodriguez, Dir., USCIS., et al. Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with\nRespect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to Certain\nIndividuals Who Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents (Nov. 20, 2014)( the\n\"2014 DAPA Memo\")( AR 37).) The 2014 DAPA Memo also expanded the DACA program by\n(1) permitting individuals bom before June 15, 1981, to apply for deferred action;( 2)e xtending\nthe term of the benefits obtained under the DACA program from two to three years; and\n(3) adjusting the date-of-entry requirement so that individuals who entered the United States\nbefore January 1, 2010, could obtain deferred action and work authorization. (Id at 3-4.) The\ncourt refers to these changes to the DACA program as the \"DACA Expansion.\"\nFollowing the issuance of the 2014 DAPA Memo,t wenty-six states, led by Texas, filed\nsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southem District of Texas, claiming that the DAPA\nprogram violated the Administrative Procedure Act( \"APA\"),5  U.S.C. § 550 et sea., and the\nTake Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const, art. II, § 3. S^ Texas v. United States.\n86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 598 (S.D. Tex. 2015). On Febmary 16, 2015, the district court concluded\nthat those states had standing to sue and were likely to succeed on the merits of their procedural\nAPA claim that the 2014 DAPA Memo was invalid because it constituted a \"substantive mle,\"\nnot a \"general statement of policy,\" and thus should have been promulgated through notice-and-\ncomment mlemaking. Id at 671-72. The court issued a nationwide injunction against the\nimplementation of the DAPA program, id at 677-78, and the DACA Expansion, id at 678 n.l 11.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed that decision, finding that the plaintiff states were likely to succeed\nboth on their claim that the 2014 DAPA Memo should have been made through notice-and-\ncomment procedures and on their claim that the memo was substantively Contrary to the INA.\nTexas v. United States. 809 F.3d 134, 178,186 (5th Cir. 2015)( as revised). The Fifth Circuit\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 6 of 48 PageID #: 3800\ndeclined to reach the plaintiff states' Take Care Clause claim. Id at 146 n.3. The decision was\naffirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court.  136 S. Ct. 2271 (Mem.).\n3. PAPA Rescission\nThe Executive Branch's immigration-enforcement priorities shifted with the election of\nPresident Donald Trump. Shortly after his Inauguration, President Trump issued an executive\norder that cast doubt on the exemption of\" classes or categories of removable aliens from\npotential enforcement.\" Exec. Order 13,768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the\nUnited States, 82 Fed. Reg. 8799 (Jan. 25,2017). The following month, then-Secretary of DHS\nJohn Kelly implemented that order by issuing a memorandum rescinding \"all existing conflicting\ndirectives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding enforcement of our immigration laws and\npriorities for removal,\" except for the DACA and PAPA programs, which he left in place.\n(Mem. from John Kelly, Sec'y, PHS,t o Kevin McAleenan, Acting Comm'r, CBP,e t al..\nEnforcement oft he Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest at 2( Feb. 20, 2017)( AR\n230).) Four months later. Secretary Kelly issued another memorandum, which rescinded the\nPAPA program and the PACA Expansion based on \"the preliminary injunction in this matter,\nthe ongoing litigation, the fact that PAPA never took effect, and our new immigration\nenforcement priorities.\" (Mem.f rom John F. Kelly, Sec'y, PHS,t o Kevin K. McAleenan,\nActing Comm'r, CBP, et al.. Rescission of November 20,2014, Memorandum Providing for\nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents( \"PAPA\") at 3( June\n15, 2017)( AR 235).) That memorandum did not, however, rescind the original PACA program\nor revoke the three-year-long deferred action and work authorization issued between the\nannouncement of the PACA Expansion and the Southern District of Texas's issuance of a\npreliminary injunction against that program. (Id. at 2 & n.3).\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 7 of 48 PageID #: 3801\n4. DACA Rescission\nFollowing the rescission oft he 2014 DAPA  Memo, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\nwrote on behalf of eleven states to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand that the \"Executive\nBranch\" rescind the 2012 DACA Memo. (Ltr. from Ken Paxton, Att'y Gen. of Texas, to Hon.\nJeff Sessions, Att'y Gen. of the U.S.( June 29, 2017)a t 2( AR 239).) Paxton warned that, if DHS\ndid not act to end the DACA program, the plaintiff states would amend their complaint in Texas\nV. United States to challenge the DACA program and the remaining work permits issued under\nthe DACA Expansion. (Id at 2.)\nThereafter, Attorney General Sessions wrote to Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke to\n\"advise that[ DHS] should rescind\" the 2012 DACA Memo.^ (Letter from Jefferson B. Sessions,\nIII, Att'y Gen. of the U.S., to Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y, DHS (the \"Sessions Letter\")( AR\n251).) The Attorney General opined that DACA was unconstitutional and that the Texas\nplaintiffs would likely prevail in their anticipated challenge to the program:\nDACA was effectuated by the previous administration through\nexecutive action, without proper statutory authority and with no\nestablished end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed\nlegislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an\nopen-ended  circumvention  of  immigration  laws  was  an\nunconstitutional exercise ofa uthority by the Executive Branch. The\nrelated Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful\nPermanent Residents( DAPA)p olicy was enjoined on a nationwide\nbasis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit on the basis of\nmultiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally\ndivided vote.  Then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly\nrescinded the DAPA policy in June. Because the DACA policy has\nthe same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized\nas to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would\nyield similar results with respect to DACA.\n(Id.( citation omitted).)\nWhile the letter is not dated, the PDF of the AR dates the letter September 4, 2017. (See also Defs. Mem. at 9.)\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 8 of 48 PageID #: 3802\nOn September 5, 2017, Defendants rescinded the DACA program.\"^ The Attomey\nGeneral announced the decision at a press conference, and Acting Secretary Duke implemented\nthe decision by issuing a memorandum (the \"DACA Rescission Memo\")t o her subordinates.\n(DOJ,P ress Release, Attomey General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA (Sept. 5,2017),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attomey-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-daca; Mem.\nfrom Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y, DHS,t o James W. McCament, Acting Dir., USCIS, et al..\nRescission oft he June 15,2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with\nRespect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\"( Sept. 5, 2017)( AR 252).)\nDuke pointed to the mlings of the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court in the Texas litigation, as\nwell as to the Attomey General's \"legal determination\" that DACA was \"'an open-ended\ncircumvention of immigration laws'\" and '\"an xmconstitutional exercise of authority'\":\nTaking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth\nCircuit's mlings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4,2017\nletter from the Attomey General, it is clear that the June 15,2012[,]\nDACA program should be terminated.  In the exercise of my\nauthority  in  establishing  national  immigration  policies  and\npriorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified below, I\nhereby rescind the June 15,2012 memorandum.\n(Id. at 3-4( quoting Sessions Letter).)\nRather than terminating the DACA program outright, the DACA Rescission Memo\nprovided for a phased \"wind down\" of the program. First, DHS would consider initial\nDefendants maintain that, as a legal matter, Acting Secretary Duke is solely responsible for the decision to rescind\nthe DACA program. (Defs. Oct. 10,2017, Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Vacate (Dkt. 80) at 3-4.) As the court has\nnoted, however. Defendants previously represented to Ae court that the Attomey General and Acting Secretary\nDuke jointly decided to end the DACA program. (Tr. of Sept. 14, 2017, Hr'g (Docket Number Pending) 13:17-\n14:06, 24:21-24,26:1-6; Oct. 17, 2017, Mem.&   Order (Dkt. 86) at 9-10.) Defendants had not then, and still have\nnot, presented this court with any reason why it should disregard their earlier representations as to who decided to\nend the DACA program. (See Oct. 17,2017, Mem.&  Order at 10; Oct. 19,2017, Mem.&  Order at 10-11.) For\npurposes of this motion, however, nothing turns on the question of whether Acting Secretary Duke acted alone or\nwith the Attomey General and the President when terminating the DACA program, so the court simply refers to the\nactions of\" Defendants\" in this regard.\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 9 of 48 PageID #: 3803\napplications for deferred action and work authorization that it had received as of September 5,\n2017. (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.) Second, DHS would \"adjudicate—on an individual, case\nby case basis\" requests for renewal of deferred action and work authorization \"from current\nbeneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September 5,2017,] and March 5, 2018 that\nhave been accepted by [DHS]a s of October 5, 2017.\" (Id) DHS would not consider other\napplications for deferred action or work authorization under the DACA program. (Id.) Existing\ngrants of deferred action and work authorization would remain in effect \"for the remaining\nduration of their validity periods,\" though DHS would retain the authority to terminate or deny\ndeferred action when it deemed appropriate. (Id) Under the DACA Rescission Memo,t he\nbenefits granted as part of the DACA program will therefore expire gradually over the next two\nyears.\nB. Procedural Background\n1. Prior to the DACA Rescission\nThe first of the above-captioned cases, Batalla Vidal v. Duke. No. 16-CV-4756\n(E.D.N.Y.), predates the Trump Administration's decision to rescind the DACA program. In\nthat case. Plaintiff Martin Batalla Vidal initially challenged DHS's compliance with the\nnationwide injunction issued by the Southern District of Texas in Texas v. United States. Batalla\nVidal applied for deferred action and work authorization in November 2014 and, in February\n2015, was notified that he had received deferred action and work authorization for the next three\nyears under the terms of the DACA Expansion. (Compl.( Dkt. 1)H  32.) On May 14,2015,\nhowever, DHS revoked his three-year work authorization, citing the Texas injunction, and\nreplaced it with a two-year permit. (Id tH 34-36.) Batalla Vidal challenged that decision,\ncontending that the Texas plaintiffs lacked standing to seek, and the Southern District of Texas\nlacked jurisdiction to issue, a nationwide injunction. (Id ^4 3-47.) Batalla Vidal subsequently\n9\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 10 of 48 PageID #: 3804\namended his complaint to add the nonprofit organization MRNY as a plaintiff and name then-\nDirector of USCIS Leon Rodriguez as a defendant. (Am. Compl.( Dkt. 29).) In November\n2016, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs moved with Defendants' consent to stay briefing in the case\n\"[d]ue to uncertainty regarding the future of the[ DACA]p rogram.\" (Pis. Nov. 21,2016, Mot. to\nStay (Dkt. 35); Apr. 4, 2017, Joint Mot. to Stay (Dkt. 40).)\n2. Following the DACA Rescission\nFollowing Defendants' announcement oft he decision to rescind the DACA program.\nPlaintiffs brought these actions challenging that decision and certain other actions that\nDefendants have taken relating to that decision. On September 6, 2017, fifteen states and the\nDistrict of Columbia^ filed suit challenging both the rescission of the DACA program and DHS's\nalleged changes in its policy regarding the use of DACA applicants' information for\nimmigration-enforcement purposes. (State Pis. Compl.( No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 1)  269-301.)\nThe State Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, the APA,a nd the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-12 (the \"RFA\").\n(Id.) Two weeks later, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs again amended their complaint to assert\ncertain claims similar to those brought by the State Plaintiffs, as well as a claim that Defendants\nviolated the Due Process Clause by failing to notify DACA recipients that they needed to renew\ntheir deferred action and work authorization by October 5, 2017. (SAC  160-66.) Finally, the\nState Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add claims( 1) challenging the notice provided to\nDACA recipients of the rescission of the DACA program; and (2)f urther challenging the change\n'Th e State Plaintiffs were initially comprised of the States of North Carolina, Hawaii, New York, Washington,\nIowa, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Connecticut, New Mexico, and Delaware; the Commonwealths of\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District of Columbia. (State Pis. Compl.( No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt.\n1).) Colorado has since joined the case. (State Pis. Am. Compl.( No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 54).)\n10\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 11 of 48 PageID #: 3805\nin DHS's information-use policy. (State Pis. Am. Compl.( No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 54)  246-52,\n274-80.) Together, Plaintiffs now assert the following claims:\nEqual Protection. Both sets of Plaintiffs allege that the decision to rescind the DA CA \nprogram violated the equal-protection principles incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,^  B oiling v. Shame, 347 U.S. 497, 498-500 (1954),\nbecause that decision was motivated by improper considerations. (SAC  167-70; State Pis.\nAm. Compl.f l 233-39.) The State Plaintiffs allege that the DACA Rescission Memo \"target[s]\nindividuals for discriminatory treatment, without lawful justification\" and that it was \"motivated,\nat least in part, by a discriminatory motive and/or a desire to harm a particular group.\" (State\nPis. Am. Compl.  235-36.) The Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs allege that President Trump, Attorney\nGeneral Sessions, and Acting Secretary Duke violated the Due Process Clause in deciding to\nrescind the DACA program because that decision \"targets Latinos and, in particular, Mexicans,\nand will have a disparate impact on these groups,\" and \"was substantially motivated by animus\ntoward Latinos and, in particular, Mexicans.\" (SAC  169-70.)\nDue Process—^Individualized Notice. Both sets of Plaintiffs also contend that\nDefendants violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by failing to provide DACA\nrecipients with adequate notice oft he decision to rescind the DACA program. (SAC  160-66;\nState Pis. Am. Compl.  274-80.) In particular, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs allege that, prior to\nthe DACA Rescission Memo,D HS advised DACA recipients to submit applications to renew\ntheir deferred action and work authorization \"as soon as possible\" and, in particular, 120-150\ndays before expiration, to ensure that those benefits did not expire before DHS could process the\nrenewal applications. (SAC 1164.) Following the issuance of the DACA Rescission Memo,\nDefendants did not send individual revised notices to alert DACA recipients who were eligible to\n11\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 12 of 48 PageID #: 3806\nrenew their deferred action and work authorization (i.e., individuals whose benefits expired\nbefore March 5, 2018)t hat they only had until October 5,2017, to do so. (Id H 165.) The State\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by\nfailing to provide DACA recipients with \"adequate notice\" about \"the procedures and timeline\nfor renewing their DACA status,\" \"the general termination of the DACA program after March 5,\n2018,\" or \"their inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018.\" (State\nPis. Am. Compl.tH 276-77.)\nDue Process—^Information-Use Policy. Both sets of Plaintiffs assert that DHS\nimpermissibly backtracked on its representations that it would use information gleaned fi-om\nDACA applications for immigration-enforcement purposes only in limited circumstances. (SAC\nUK 151,153; State Pis. Am. Compl. KK 240-45.) While, as discussed below, the Batalla Vidal\nPlaintiffs fold this challenge into their substantive APA claim, the State Plaintiffs challenge this\ndecision as \"fundamentally unfair,\" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. (State Pis. Am. Compl. K 243.)\nEquitable Estoppel—^Information-Use Policy. The State Plaintiffs argue that the\ndoctrine of equitable estoppel bars DHS from changing its policy regarding the use of DACA\napplicants' information. (Id KK 246-52.) The State Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, having\n\"made repeated affirmative statements about the protections that would be given to the personal\ninformation provided by DACA applicants\" and \"placed affirmative restrictions on the use of\nsuch information for purposes of immigration enforcement\"( id K 248), are now estopped from\nusing that information for immigration-enforcement purposes( id KK 250-51). The court refers to\nthis claim, together with Plaintiffs' constitutional information-use policy claims, as Plaintiffs'\n\"information-use policy claims.\"\n12\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 13 of 48 PageID #: 3807\nAPA—^Arbitrary and Capricious. Both sets of Plaintiffs challenge the decision to end\nthe DACA program under the APA as substantively \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). (SAC  149-54;\nState Pis. Am. Compl.  253-56.) The Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs contend that Attorney General\nSessions and Acting Secretary Duke acted arbitrarily and capriciously by deciding to end the\nDACA program and by changing DHS's policy regarding the confidentiality of DACA\napplicants' information because those decisions \"(a) lack a rational explanation for the change in\npolicy on which persons had reasonably relied,( b) are based on a legal error, and (c)f ailed to\nconsider all relevant factors.\" (SAC ^ 151.) The State Plaintiffs argue that the implementation\noft he DACA Rescission Memo and termination of the DACA program \"with minimal formal\nguidance\" constituted arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful action in violation of Section 706 of the\nAPA. (State Pis. Am. Compl.^  254-55.) The court refers to these claims together as Plaintiffs'\n\"substantive APA claims.\"\nAPA—^Notice and Comment. Both sets of Plaintiffs also contend that DHS's\nimplementation of the DACA Rescission Memo constitutes a substantive or legislative \"rule\" for\npurposes of the APA,a nd thus needed to be made through notice-and-comment rulemaking\nprocedures. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. (SAC  144-48; State Pis. Am. Compl.  257-65.) In\nparticular, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs argue that the DACA Rescission Memo is a substantive\nrule,\" as it binds DHS to categorically deny applications for deferred action to individuals who\nfit the original DACA eligibility criteria.\" (SAC f 146.) The State Plaintiffs, on the other hand,\nargue that the promulgation and implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo \"categorically\nand definitively changed the substantive criteria by which individual DACA grantees work, live,\nattend school, obtain credit, and travel in the United States,\" impacting those beneficiaries'\n13\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 14 of 48 PageID #: 3808\n\"substantive rights.\" (State Pis. Am. Compl. H 261.) The court refers to these claims together as\nPlaintiffs' \"procedural APA claims.\"\nRFA. Finally, both sets of Plaintiffs assert claims under the RPA. Plaintiffs claim that\nDefendants violated the RFA by issuing the DACA Rescission Memo without conducting an\nanalysis of the rescission's impact on \"small entities.\" (SAC  155-59; State Pis. Am. Compl.\n266-73.) MRNY alleges that it is a \"small organization\" that is directly affected by the\nDACA Rescission Memo and thus has a cause of action under the RFA. (SAC T| 156.) The State\nPlaintiffs assert that they and their \"small governmental jurisdictions, nonprofits, and businesses,\nand their residents\" are harmed by Defendants' failure to conduct such a regulatory impact\nanalysis. (State Pis. Am. Compl. 273.) The court refers to these claims as Plaintiffs \"RFA\nclaims.\"\nThe following chart summarizes these claims:\na.

District Court Proceedings\nThe parties have vigorously litigated these actions before this court. Although the full\nprocedural history can be discerned from the relevant dockets, the court provides the following\nlimited summary of the proceedings to date.\nConsistent with the regular practice of courts in this district in civil cases, discovery\nmatters were referred to the magistrate judge assigned to the case, Magistrate Judge James\nOrenstein, to decide in the first instance.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); Local Civ. R. 72.2.\nAfter soliciting the views of the parties as to whether discovery should proceed (Sept. 15, 2017,\nOrder (Dkt. 58)), Judge Orenstein authorized discovery to proceed over Defendants' objections\n(Tr. of Sept. 26, 2017, Hr'g (Docket Number Pending) 26:21-27:22). Judge Orenstein then\nissued a case management and scheduling order (the \"Case Management Order\"), which\nconfirmed the previously announced discovery schedule. (Sept. 27, 2017, Order (Dkt. 67).) Of\nparticular relevance to these proceedings, the Case Management and Scheduling Order required\nDefendants to produce, by October 6, 2017, an administrative record as well as a privilege log\ndescribing \"every document considered within any component of the executive branch as part of\nthe process of determining the policy and actions at issue in these actions that are not being\nproduced and as to which the defendants would assert a claim of privilege, regardless of whether\nthe defendants deem such ... record to be part of the official administrative record.\" (Id. UK 11(c)\n(the \"Privilege Log Requirement\").)\nDefendants promptly challenged the Case Management Order. On September 29,2017,\nDefendants filed a motion before this court \"seek[ing] relief from\" the Privilege Log\nRequirement, which, they argued,\" raise[d] substantial separation-of-powers concems,\" to the\nextent it could be read as applying to White House communications, and required Defendants to\nassert privilege with respect to documents that were not properly included in the administrative\n15\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 16 of 48 PageID #: 3810\nrecord. (Sept. 29,2017, Defs. Mot. to Vacate (Dkt. 69)( \"Defs. Sept. 29 Mot.\") at 2-5.)\nDefendants also argued that it would be impossible to comply with the Privilege Log\nRequirement within the deadline set by the Case Management Order (id at 5), and that the court\nshould consider threshold arguments for dismissal of these cases before allowing discovery to\nproceed (id at 5-6). Defendants did not specifically argue that discovery was inappropriate,\nalthough they reincorporated arguments against discovery by reference to a letter they had filed\nwith Judge Orenstein a week earlier and briefly outlined three \"threshold dismissal arguments.\"\n(Id. at 1, 5-6; see also Defs. Sept. 22, 2017, Ltr. Regarding Discovery (Dkt. 65).)\nThe court issued two orders in response to Defendants' objections. The first order\nextended the deadline for complying with the Privilege Log Requirement by two weeks, so that\nthe court could consider whether the as-yet-unproduced administrative record was adequate and\nwhether Defendants retained the presumption that they had correctly compiled the record.\n(Oct. 3, 2017, Order( Dkt. 72).) Defendants subsequently asked the court to narrow the Privilege\nLog Requirement or vacate it entirely. (Defs. Oct. 10, 2017, Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Vacate\n(Dkt. 80)a t 2.) At the same time. Defendants also asked the court to stay discovery pending\nresolution of Defendants' anticipated dispositive motions, which Defendants averred would\n\"raise arguments that are strong, purely legal, and completely dispositive of Plaintiffs' claims.\"\n(Id. at 4.) Defendants did not, however, specifically identify what those arguments were (instead\ncross-referencing their September 29 Motion and string-citing to authority discussed below) or\naddress any of the factors that courts in this district consider in analyzing whether a party has\ndemonstrated \"good cause\" to stay discovery.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); Richards v. N. Shore\nLong Island Jewish Health Svs.. No. lO-CV-4544( LDW)( ETB), 2011 WL 4407518, at *1\n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21,2011).\n16\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 17 of 48 PageID #: 3811\nThe court then issued its second order, which narrowed the scope of the Privilege Log\nRequirement but denied Defendants' request to stay discovery. (Oct. 17, 2017 Mem.&   Order\n(the \"Oct. 17 M&O\")( Dkt. 86).) With respect to Defendants' arguments that discovery outside\nthe administrative record was inappropriate, the court noted that Defendants had not identified\nany reason why its review of Plaintiffs' information-use policy and notice claims should be\nlimited to an administrative record that only purported to document the decision to rescind the\nDACA program. (Id at 3-5.) The court declined to vacate the Privilege Log Requirement\nbefore Judge Orenstein decided whether the administrative record was complete. (Oct. 17 M&O\nat 5-6.) The court agreed, however, that the Privilege Log Requirement should be narrowed to\nexclude materials other than DHS and DOJ communications. (Id at 7-9.) Finally, the court\ndeclined to exempt DOJ from the Privilege Log Requirement, as Defendants had failed to\nexplain their apparent reversal in position regarding whether Attorney General Sessions was\nresponsible for the decision to rescind the DACA program. (Id at 9-10.)\nThe following evening. Defendants renewed their motion to stay discovery, this time\nthreatening to seek mandamus review if the court did not address their objections by 2 p.m. the\nfollowing day. (Defs. Oct. 18, 2017, Mot. to Stay (Dkt. 87).) The court ruled expeditiously on\nthese requests. On October 19, 2017, Judge Orenstein issued an order granting Plaintiffs' motion\nto compel Defendants to produce a complete administrative record. (Oct. 19, 2017, Order\nGranting Motion to Produce (Dkt. 89).) The same day, this court issued another memorandum\nand order, granting in part and denying in part Defendants' motion for a stay. (Oct. 19, 2017,\nMem.&   Order (the \"Oct. 19 M&O\")a t 9-11.) In light of Defendants' ongoing (and, this time,\nfactually substantiated) concerns about the burdens of complying with the Privilege Log\nRequirement, the court agreed to stay the Privilege Log Requirement except with respect to\n17\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 18 of 48 PageID #: 3812\ndocuments directly considered by the Attorney General, Acting Secretary Duke, and their\nsubordinates who directly advised them on the decision to end the DACA program. (Id.) The\ncourt concluded, however, that Defendants had not demonstrated \"good cause\" warranting a stay\nof discovery (id at 4-9), nor that they were entitled to a stay pending mandamus review (id at\n11-12).\nOn October 20,2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an\nemergency stay of discovery and record supplementation in proceedings before this court,\ncontingent on Defendants' filing a full petition for a writ of mandamus by 3 p.m. on October 23,\n2017. (Oct. 20, 2017, USCA Order (Dkt. 91).) Four days later, the Second Circuit issued a\nsecond order, which extended the stay pending determination of the mandamus petition but\ndeferred ruling on that petition \"until such time as the district court has considered and decided\nexpeditiously issues ofj urisdiction and justiciability.\" (Oct. 24, 2017, USCA Order (Dkt. 99).)\nIn light of that order, the court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs as to whether the\ncourt \"lacks jurisdiction to consider the claims raised in [these cases] or why such claims are\notherwise non-justiciable.\" (Oct. 24, 2017, Order.) In response to that order. Defendants filed\nthe motion to dismiss currently before the court. That motion not only argues that the court lacks\njurisdiction to hear these cases, but also contends that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which\nrelief should be granted and that the court should not grant a nationwide injunction, should it\ndecide that Plaintiffs are entitled to relief.^\n® Prior to filing their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants requested and received leave to file an overlong brief\" in order\n... to fully present their dismissal arguments in these cases.\" (Defs. Oct. 25, 2017, Appl. for Leave to File Excess\nPages( DlU. 94); Oct. 26,2017, Order Granting Defendants' Application for Leave to File Excess Pages.) That\napplication did not expressly indicate that Defendants intended to present arguments for dismissal for failure to state\na claim under Rule 12(b)(6), as opposed to just the \"jurisdiction and justiciability\" arguments specifically referenced\nby the Second Circuit's and this court's October 24,2017, orders. Defendants would not have required these excess\npages had they confined their briefing to those issues. (See Oct. 27,2017, Order( Dkt. 98).)\n18\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 19 of 48 PageID #: 3813\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS\nPursuant to the Second Circuit's direction, the court addresses only \"issues ofjurisdiction\nand justiciability\" at this point in the proceedings. (Oct. 24, 2017, USCA Order; Oct. 27,2017,\nOrder (Dkt. 98).) Accordingly, the court will consider only those portions of Defendants'\nmotion to dismiss that challenge the court's subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nUnder Rule 12(b)(1), the court must dismiss a claim \"for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction ... when the ... court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\nMakarova v. United States. 201 F.3d 110,113 (2d Cir. 2000). When considering a Rule 12(b)(1)\nmotion, the court \"must take all uncontroverted facts in the complaint... as true, and draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the party asserting jurisdiction.\" Tandon v. Captain's Cove\nMarina of Bridgeport. Inc.. 752 F.3d 239,243 (2d Cir. 2014). Nevertheless,\" the party asserting\nsubject matter jurisdiction 'has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it\nexists.'\" Id (quoting Makarova. 201 F.3d at 113). \"[Wjhere jurisdictional facts are placed in\ndispute, the court has the power and obligation to decide issues of fact by reference to evidence\noutside the pleadings, such as affidavits.\" Id (quoting APWU v. Potter. 343 F.3d 619,6 27\n(2d Cir. 2003)).\nIII.  DISCUSSION\nDefendants raise four challenges to the court's authority to hear the above-captioned\ncases. First, Defendants argue, these cases are not justiciable under the APA because the\ndecision to rescind the DACA program was \"committed to agency discretion by law.\"\n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). (Defs. Mem. at 12-17.) Second, Defendants contend that the decision to\nterminate the DACA program constitutes a denial of deferred action,j udicial review of which is\nbarred by Section 1252(g) of the INA.^  8  U.S.C. § 1252(g). (Id at 17-19.) Third, they\n19\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 20 of 48 PageID #: 3814\nmaintain, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs lack standing to bring certain claims Qd at 28-29, 34-35,\n37), and the State Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to bring any claims( id at 19-21). Fourth,\nDefendants assert, the State Plaintiffs and MRNY cannot bring claims under the APA because\nthey assert interests that fall outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the INA. (Id at 19-20.)\nThe court addresses each argument in turn.\nA. Committed to Agency Discretion by Law\nDefendants first argue that these cases are non-justiciable because the decision to end the\nDAGA  program was committed to DHS's exclusive discretion by law. The court disagrees.\nCertain agency decisions, including decisions not to institute enforcement action, are\npresumptively immune from judicial review under the APA because they are \"committed to\nagency discretion by law.\"  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chanev, 470 U.S. 821 (1985).\nBut the rescission of the DACA program was not such a decision, nor have Defendants explained\nwhy Section 701(a)(2) precludes review of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims or other claims\nchallenging actions other than the decision to rescind the DACA program.^\n1. Statutorv and Equitable Claims\nSection 701(a)(2) oft he APA does not preclude judicial review of Plaintiffs' statutory\nand equitable claims. \"Under the APA,a  party aggrieved by agency action is generally 'entitled\nto judicial review thereof.'\" Westchester v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.. 778 F.3d 412,\n418( 2d Cir. 2015)( quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702). \"There is a strong presumption favoring judicial\nreview of administrative action.\" Salazar v. King. 822 F.3d 61, 75 (2d Cir. 2016). Judicial\nreview is not available, however,\" to the extent that... statutes preclude judicial review,\"\n'It  is not clear whether Section 701(a)(2) limits the court's jurisdiction or instead forms an \"essential element\" of a\nclaim for relief under the APA. Sharkev v. Quarantillo. 541 F.3d 75, 87-88( 2d Cir. 2008); accord Convers v.\nRossides. 558 F.3d 137, 143 n.8 (2d Cir. 2009). Nothing turns on this distinction here, however, because Section\n701(a)(2) does not shield Defendants' actions from Judicial review.\n20\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 21 of 48 PageID #: 3815\n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), or \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law,\" § 701(a)(2).\nThe latter is \"a very narrow exception\" to the presumption of reviewability of agency action\nunder the APA,a nd it applies \"in those rare instances where 'statutes are drawn in such broad\nterms that in a given case there is no law to apply.'\" Citizens to Pres. Overton Park. Inc. v.\nVolne. 401 U.S. 402,410( 1971)( quoting S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945)),\nabrogated on other grounds bv Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99( 1977); see also Chanev. 470\nU.S. at 830( agency action is unreviewable \"if a statute is drawn so that a court would have no\nmeaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion\"). \"To determine\nwhether there is 'law to apply' that provides 'judicially manageable standards' for judging an\nagency's exercise of discretion, the courts look to the statutory text, the agency's regulations, and\ninformal agency guidance that govern the agency's challenged action.\" Salazar. 822 F.3d at 76\n(quoting Chanev. 470 U.S. at 830). These enactments supply \"law to apply\" because they may\ngovern the agency's exercise of its own discretion. See id. at 76-77 (citing INS v. Yueh-Shaoi\nYang. 519 U.S. 26, 32( 1996)); Sec'v of Labor v. Twentvmile Coal Co.. 456 F.3d 151,158-59\n(D.C. Cir. 2006).\na.  \"Law to Apply\"\nHere, there is \"law to apply,\" permitting meaningful judicial review of Plaintiffs'\nstatutory claims. Plaintiffs assert statutory claims under the APA and RFA. With respect to\nPlaintiffs' procedural APA and RFA claims, the relevant \"law to apply\" is found in the APA and\nRFA themselves, both of which specify procedures that agencies must follow when engaging in\n\"substantive\" or \"legislative\" rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553,6 04. The process by which an\nagency makes a rule may be reviewed for compliance with applicable procedural requirements\nregardless of whether the substance of the rule is itself reviewable. See Lincoln v. Vigil. 508\n21\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 22 of 48 PageID #: 3816\nU.S. 182,195-98 09931: Am. Med. Ass'n v. Reno. 57 F.3d 1129,1134( D.C. Cir. 1995): N.Y.C.\nEmployees' Ret. Svs. v. SEC.4 5 F.3d 7,11 (2d Cir. 1995).\nThere is also \"law to apply\" permitting meaningful judicial review of Plaintiffs'\nsubstantive APA claims. In order to satisfy Section 706(2)(a), Plaintiffs must identify some\nsource of law, other than the APA's \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, against which the court\ncan review their claims: \"If agency actions could be challenged as 'arbitrary and capricious,'\nwithout reference to any other standard, then § 701( a)(2)'s limitation on APA review would\namount to no limitation at all, and nothing would ever be 'committed to agency discretion by\nlaw.'\" Lunnev v. United States, 319 F.3d 550, 559 n.5 (2d Cir. 2003). The court agrees that\nPlaintiffs have identified \"law to apply\" to these claims. In deciding to rescind the DACA\nprogram, Defendants expressly and exclusively relied on a legal determination that the program\nwas unlawful and could not be sustained in court. (Sessions Letter, AR 251; DACA Rescission\nMemo, AR 253-55.) The court may review that rationale in light of, among other sources, the\ntext of the INA and other statutes, the history of the use of deferred action by immigration\nauthorities, and the OLC Opinion.'® While Defendants attempt to recast the decision to rescind\nthe DACA program as the product of a discretionary \"balancing of the costs and benefits of\nkeeping the policy in place, on one hand, with the risk of' potentially imminent litigation' that\ncould throw DACA into immediate turmoil\"( Defs. Mem. at 15), that argument is unsupported\nby the text of the Sessions Letter and the DACA Rescission Memo.\nThe State Plaintiffs also assert a claim for equitable estoppel. (State Pis. Am. Compl.  246-52.) With respect to\nthe State Plaintiffs' equitable estoppel claim, the court assumes for the sake of argument that the relevant \"law to\napply\" may be found in DHS's past statements and practices regarding the use of DACA applicants' information.\nSee Salazar. 822 F.3d at 76-77. (S^ State Pis. Am. Compl.  39-44.) The court need not decide this question,\nhowever, because, as discussed below, the State Plaintiffs lack standing to assert this claim. (See infra Section\nIII.C.2.b.)\n22\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 23 of 48 PageID #: 3817\nDefendants' argument that the decision to rescind the DACA program is unreviewable,\nnotwithstanding the \"substantive legal\" rationale given for that decision (Defs. Mem. at 15), is\nunpersuasive. Defendants correctly note that unreviewable agency action does not become\nreviewable simply because \"the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable\naction.\" (Defs. Mem. at 13 (quoting ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs, 482 U.S. 270,283\n(1987)( \"BLE\")).) See BLE,4 82 U.S. at 283 (\"[A] common reason for failure to prosecute an\nalleged criminal violation is the prosecutor's belief... that the law will not sustain a conviction.\nThat is surely an eminently 'reviewable' proposition, in the sense that courts are well qualified to\nconsider the point; yet it is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject of\njudicial review.\"). That argument simply begs the question, however, of whether the decision to\nrescind DACA is actually unreviewable. While it may be true that a presumptively unreviewable\ndecision does not become subject to judicial review simply because the decisionmaker expresses\na \"reviewable\" rationale,\" see id., the decision to rescind the DACA program was not inherently\nsuch a decision, as the following section discusses in detail.\nb.  Prosecutorial Discretion\nNor does the decision to end the DACA program fall within a class of decisions\ntraditionally regarded as presumptively immune from judicial review under Section 701(a)(2) of\nthe APA. (Defs. Mem. at 12-14.) Defendants assert that the decision to rescind the DACA\nprogram constitutes \"an exercise of enforcement discretion\" that is \"entrusted to the agency\nalone\" and immune from judicial review. (Id. at 15.) The court concludes, however, that the\ndecision to eliminate the DACA program—a program by which certain undocumented\nimmigrants could request immigration authorities to exercise prosecutorial discretion with\nrespect to them—^was not itself a presumptively unreviewable exercise of enforcement\ndiscretion.\n23\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 24 of 48 PageID #: 3818\nDefendants rely in particular on Chanev, which held that decisions n^ to take\nenforcement action were presumptively not subject to judicial review under the APA. In\nChanev. the Court rejected an attempt by a group of prisoners awaiting execution by lethal\ninjunction to force the Food and Drug Administration to take enforcement action to prevent the\nuse of certain drugs for capital punishment.  Chanev. 470 U.S. at 823-25, 830-33. The Court\nheld that a regulator's refusal to take enforcement action was presumptively unreviewable,\nbecause decisions not to take enforcement action typically \"involve[]a complicated balancing of\na number of factors which are peculiarly within [the agency's] expertise,\" id at 831, and do not\nimplicate the agency's exercise of\" coercive power over an individual's liberty or property\nrights, and thus do[] not infnnge upon areas that courts often are called to protect,\" id. at 832.\nThe decision to rescind DACA is unlike the non-enforcement decision at issue in Chanev.\nFirst, Plaintiffs do not challenge an agency's failure or refusal to prosecute or take enforcement\nactions with respect to certain violations of law. Instead, they challenge Defendants' affirmative\ndecision to eliminate a program by which DHS exercised prosecutorial discretion with respect to\na large number of undocumented immigrants. The DACA Rescission Memo curtails (if it does\nnot eliminate outright) DHS's ability to exercise prosecutorial discretion with respect to\nindividuals previously eligible to request deferred action. Although the DACA Rescission\nMemo notes that it does not limit DHS's \"otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation\nprerogatives,\" it makes clear that DHS \"[wjill reject all DACA initial requests and associated\napplications for Employment Authorization Documents filed after [September 5, 2017]\" and\n\"[w]ill reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment\nAuthorization Documents\" inconsistent with the terms of the Memo. This affirmative decision\nto constrain DHS's prosecutorial discretion cannot be analogized to an exercise of prosecutorial\n24\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 25 of 48 PageID #: 3819\ndiscretion, which would be presumptively immune from judicial review. C£ Texas, 809 F.3d at\n165-69 (creation of the DAPA program was reviewable because it was a \"affirmative agency\naction,\" not an exercise of enforcement discretion). Second, Plaintiffs do not challenge non-\nenforcement decisions, which do not subject individuals to the \"coercive power\" oft he state.\nChanev. 470 U.S. at 831. To the contrary, the rescission oft he DACA program subjects\nindividuals who previously enjoyed some protection from removal to coercive state authority.\nThird, Defendants' decision to rescind the DACA program does not appear to have been\nmotivated by a \"complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within [the\nagency's] expertise.\" S^ id. Instead, Defendants stated that they were required to rescind the\nDACA program because it was unlawful, which suggests both that Defendants did not believe\nthat they were exercising discretion when rescinding the program and that their reasons for doing\nso are within the competence of this court to review. (Sessions Letter; DACA Rescission Memo\nat 4.) The decision to rescind the DACA program is thus manifestly unlike the non-enforcement\ndecision at issue in Chanev. While courts have also held that agency decisions to take (as\nopposed to refrain from taking) enforcement action are also unreviewable under the APA when\nthere are no judicially manageable standards for reviewing the agency's discretion in choosing to\nbring an enforcement action,^  S peed Mining. Inc. v. Fed. Mine Safetv & Health Rev.\nComm'n. 528 F.3d 310, 316-19( 4th Cir. 2008); Twentvmile Coal. 456 F.3d at 155-59, those\ncases are inapposite because there is \"law to apply\" to review the decision to rescind DACA.\nFinally, Defendants' arguments that Section 701(a)(2) precludes judicial review of\nPlaintiffs' suits focus on the decision to rescind the DACA program. Defendants do not explain\nwhy the alleged decision to change DHS's policy regarding the use of DACA applicants'\ninformation should be immune from judicial review. To the contrary, there is \"law to apply\" in\n25\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 26 of 48 PageID #: 3820\nreviewing that decision (namely, DHS's prior statements about the uses of DACA applicants'\ninformation), and the court does not understand how the change in that policy can be analogized\nto the sorts of decisions, such as enforcement and non-enforcement decisions, that courts have\nrecognized as presumptively exempt from judicial review. Accordingly, to the extent the Batalla\nVidal Plaintiffs also challenge DHS's alleged change in information-use policy as part of their\nsubstantive APA claim, that claim is reviewable. (SAC Iffl 151,153-54.)\n2. Constitutional Claims\nNor does Section 701(a)(2) preclude judicial review of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims.\nIt is well-established that \"even where agency action is 'committed to agency discretion by law,'\nreview is still available to determine if the Constitution has been violated.\" Padula v. Webster.\n822 F.2d 97, 101 (D.C. Cir. 19871: accord Inova Alexandria Hosp. v. Shalala, 244 F.3d 342, 347\n(4th Cir. 2001); Woodward v. United States. 871 F.2d 1068, 1072-73 (Fed. Cir. 1989).\nIn Webster v. Doe. 486 U.S. 592( 1988), the Court rejected the Government's argument\nthat Section 701(a)(2) barred a former CIA employee from bringing constitutional claims\nchallenging his termination from the agency. Because the National Security Act of 1947 vested\nthe CIA Director with authority over firing decisions, the decision to fire the plaintiff because of\nhis sexual orientation had been \"committed to agency discretion by law,\" and he could not\nchallenge that decision under the APA. Id. at 594-95, 599-601. The National Security Act did\nnot expressly preclude review of constitutional claims, however, so the Court would not presume\nthat such claims were unreviewable. Id at 603-04 (noting that the Court has held that \"where\nCongress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be\nclear,\" in order to \"avoid the 'serious constitutional question' that would arise if a federal statute\nwere construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim\"( quoting Bowen\nV. Mich. Acad. of Familv Phvsicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681 n.1 2 (1986))). Similarly, Defendants\n26\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 27 of 48 PageID #: 3821\nidentify no express indication that Congress intended to preclude judicial review of the actions at\nissue in these cases. While DHS undoubtedly exercises \"wide discretion ... in the enforcement\nof the immigration laws\"( Defs. Mem. at 16), that is insufficient to preclude review of Plaintiffs'\nconstitutional claims.\n3. Deference to the Executive Branch on Immigration Matters Does Not\nCounsel a Different Result\nLastly, Defendants contend that the court should read Section 701(a)(2) broadly in light\noft he Executive Branch's wide discretion to enforce the immigration laws. (Id at 16-17.) The\nSupreme Court, however, has applied the \"strong presumption in favor ofj udicial review of\nadministrative action\" in the immigration context. See INS v. St. Cvr. 533 U.S. 289, 299( 2001).\nDefendants' specific arguments for a broad reading of Section 701(a)(2) likewise unavailing.\nWhile Defendants argue that judicial review of these cases is inappropriate because review could\nslow down the Executive Branch's removal of undocumented immigrants from this country, 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(g) already precludes individuals in removal proceedings from delaying those\nproceedings by claiming that they were improperly denied deferred action. S^ AAADC,5 25\nU.S. at 485. In any event, those concerns do not apply to these cases, as the court discusses in\nSection III.B below. Defendants also argue that judicial review of immigration decisions is\ninappropriate because judicial review \"may involve 'not merely the disclosure of normal\ndomestic law enforcement priorities and techniques, but often the disclosure of foreign-policy\nobjectives' or other sensitive matters.\" (Defs. Mem. at 16 (quoting AAADC.5 25 U.S. at 490).)\nDefendants' stated rationale for rescinding the DAGA program, however, turns wholly on\nquestions of U.S. constitutional and administrative law, not sensitive law-enforcement,\nintelligence, or foreign-policy issues. In any event, vague speculation that judicial review might\nsomehow implicate foreign-policy concerns is insufficient to justify a presumption that\n27\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 28 of 48 PageID #: 3822\nimmigration cases are not subject to judicial review.  Washington v. Trump. 847 F.3d 1151,\n1161 (9th Cir. 2017)( \"[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the notion that\nthe political branches have unreviewable authority over immigration  \"), reconsid. en banc\ndenied. 853 F.3d 933 (9th Cir. 2017), superseded bv 858 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2017). While the\ncourt is sensitive to the deference warranted to the Executive Branch in this sphere. Defendants'\nclaims for deference cannot substitute for the \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Congress\nintended to restrict judicial review of administrative action. Sharkev v. Ouarantillo. 541 F.3d 75,\n84( 2d Cir. 2008)( internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nB. INA Jurisdictional Bar\nNor does the INA divest the court ofj urisdiction to hear this case. That Act contains a\nprovision, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), that limits judicial review of certain actions \"by or behalf of any\nalien arising from\" certain deportation proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g);^  A AADC.5 25 U.S.\nat 472. As explained below, that provision has no bearing on these cases, which do not arise\nfrom one of the three specifically enumerated actions by immigration authorities that trigger\napplication oft he statute. Moreover, by its terms. Section 1252(g) does not apply to claims\nbrought by MRNY or the State Plaintiffs.\n1. Programmatic Challenges to DACA-Related Decisions\nFirst, the court considers whether Section 1252(g) strips the court ofj urisdiction to hear\nPlaintiffs' challenges to the decision to rescind the DACA program. The court begins, as usual,\nwith the text of the statute. In relevant part, Section 1252(g) provides as follows:\nExcept as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law (statutory or nonstatutory). .. no court shall have\njurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\narising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to\ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders\nagainst anv alien under this chapter.\n28\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 29 of 48 PageID #: 3823\n(emphasis added). As the Court has stated, this \"provision applies only to three discrete actions\nthat the Attorney General make take: her 'decision or action' to 'commence proceedings,\nadjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.'\" AAADC.5 25 U.S. at 482. Accordingly, the court\nmust consider whether Plaintiffs' suits \"arise from [a] decision or action by [DHS^^] to\ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\" 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252(g).\nThey do not. Defendants' termination of the DACA program does not, by itself,\n\"commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\" Id. By\nrescinding the DACA program. Defendants eliminated a set of guidelines identifying a discrete\nclass of undocumented immigrants who were eligible to apply for deferred action. (See 2012\nDACA Memo.) That decision, by itself, did not trigger any specific enforcement proceedings.^^\nNor do the individual Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs attack decisions by DHS to \"commence\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders\" against them or any other specific\nindividuals. Each of those Plaintiffs has received deferred action (see SAC T|1[ 3-42), and the\nrecord does not suggest that any are currently in removal proceedings and seek to challenge the\nend of the DACA program as a means of obstructing those proceedings. Instead, Plaintiffs bring\nbroad, programmatic challenges to Defendants' decisions( 1)t o end the DACA program;( 2)t o\nprovide limited notice of that decision to DACA recipients; and (3)t o change DHS's\n'' As part of transferring many immigration-related responsibilities from the Attorney General to the Secretary of\nDHS,t he Homeland Security Act of2002 provides that statutory references \"to any department, commission, or\nagency or any officer or office the functions of which are so transferred shall be deemed to refer to the Secretary [of\nDHS], other official, or component of[ DHS]t o which such function is so transferred.\" 6 U.S.C. § 557; Shabai v.\nHolder. 718 F.3d48, 51 n.3 (2dCir. 2013).\nDefendants have represented publicly that no action will be taken against DACA recipients prior to March 5,\n2018. (See, e.g.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter.com (Sept. 7, 2017, 6:42 a.m.),\nhttps://twitter.eom/realdonaldtrump/status/905788459301908480( \"For all of those( DACA)t hat are concerned\nabout your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!\").)\n29\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 30 of 48 PageID #: 3824\ninformation-use policy. None of those constitutes a \"decision or action ... to commence\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g);\ncf. Texas, 809 F.3d at 164 (creation of DAPA reviewable because \"decision to grant lawful\npresence to millions of[ undocumented immigrants] on a class-wide basis\" was not enumerated\nin the text of Section 1252(g)). Accordingly, Section 1252(g) does not bar judicial review of\nchallenges to those decisions.\nThis conclusion comports with both the plain meaning of the statute and with the\nSupreme Court's decision in AAADC. First, AAADC makes clear that Section 1252(g) only\nlimits judicial review with respect to suits arising from certain enumerated decisions by\nimmigration authorities. Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia specifically rejected the notion that\nSection 1252(g) was \"a sort of'zipper' clause that says 'no judicial review in deportation cases\nunless this section provides judicial review.\" 525 U.S. at 482. Instead,\" [t]he provision applies\nonly to [the] three discrete actions\" referenced above. Id. While \"[t]here are of course many\nother decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation process,\" the Court stated, \"[i]t is\nimplausible that the mention of three discrete events along the road to deportation was a\nshorthand way of referring to all claims arising from deportation proceedings.\" Id Defendants'\nargument that Section 1252(g) encompasses challenges to the decision to end the DACA\nprogram because \"[t]he denial of continued deferred action is a necessary step in commencing\nenforcement proceedings at some later date\"( Defs. Mem. at 18), is thus at odds with AAADC.\nSecond, the reasoning of AAADC does not support extending Section 1252(g)t o\nencompass challenges to the decision to rescind DACA. In AAADC,t he Court reasoned that\nSection 1252(g) must have been intended to limit judicial review of denials of deferred action:\nSection 1252(g) seems clearly designed to give some measure of\nprotection  to  \"no  deferred  action\"  decisions  and  similar\n30\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 31 of 48 PageID #: 3825\ndiscretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable\nat all, they at least will not be made the bases of separate rounds of\njudicial intervention outside the streamlined process that Congress\nhas designed [(i.e.. for judicial review of final orders of removal)].\n525 U.S. at 485. These limits were \"entirely understandable\" in order to prevent \"the\ndeconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings\" that could result\nif immigrants were allowed to attack in-process removal proceedings by claiming that they were\nsingled out by immigration authorities for adverse treatment. Id. at 487;^  i d. at 487-92.\nBecause the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs challenge the programmatic decision to rescind DACA,\nrather than attempting to obstruct their specific removal proceedings by claiming that they were\nimproperly denied deferred action, these cases do not implicate the concern raised in AAADC.\nAccordingly, Section 1252(g) does not preclude review of these actions.\n2. Claims bv MRNY and the State Plaintiffs\nMoreover, Section 1252(g) does not preclude judicial review of the claims brought by\nMRNY or the State Plaintiffs in particular. Again, the court begins with the text of the statute.\nSection 1252(g) only bars suits \"bv or on behalf of anv alien arising from the decision or action .\n.. to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\"\n(emphasis added). But neither MRNY nor the State Plaintiffs are suing \"on behalf of any alien\"\nin removal proceedings or subject to an order of removal. Instead, MRNY sues in its own right,\nbecause it claims that the rescission of DACA has interfered with its operations. (SAC  54-\n57.) Likewise, the State Plaintiffs sue not \"on behalf of any alien,\" but instead to vindicate their\n31\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 32 of 48 PageID #: 3826\nown proprietary and quasi-sovereign interests.  (State Pis. Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"State Pis.\nOpp'n\")( No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 82) at 19-22.) MRNY and the State Plaintiffs seek to assert\ntheir own rights and the rights of the general public, not those of individual immigrants in\nremoval proceedings or subject to orders of removal. There is no reason why Section 1252(g)\nwould deprive the court ofj urisdiction over their claims, brought on their own behalf.\nC. Standing\nThe court next considers whether Plaintiffs have established that they have standing to\nsue. Defendants only cursorily raise Article III standing defenses. (Defs. Mem. at 19-20, 34,\n37.) \"Because the standing issue goes to this [cjourt's subject matter jurisdiction,\" however,\" it\ncan be raised sua sponte.\" Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-\nMedco Managed Care. L.L.C.. 433 F.3d 181,198 (2d Cir. 2005).\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, federal courts may hear only certain \"cases\" or\n\"controversies.\" U.S. Const, art. Ill, § 2. This \"case-or-controversy requirement\" means that a\nplaintiff must have \"standing,\" or a sufficient interest in a live dispute, to sue in federal court.\nSee Snokeo. Inc. v. Robins. 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1546-47( 2016). At its \"irreducible constitutional\nminimum,\" Luian v. Defenders of Wildlife. 504 U.S. 555, 560( 1992), standing consists of three\nelements:\nTo establish Article III standing,[ Plaintiffs] must demonstrate:\" (1)\niniurv-in-fact. which is a concrete and particularized harm to a\nlegally protected interest; (2) causation in the form of a fairly\nWhile a parens patriae suit is in some sense brought by a state \"on behalf of its citizens, \"[t]he asserted quasi-\nsovereign interests will be deemed sufficiently implicated to support parens patriae standing only if' the injury\nalleged affects the general population of a State in a substantial way.'\" Puerto Rico ex rel. Ouiros v. Bramkamp.\n654 F.2d 212, 215 (2d Cir. 1981)( emphasis added)( quoting Maryland v. Louisiana. 451 U.S. 725, 738 (1981)). A\nstate cannot sue parens patriae simply to assert its citizens' personal claims. See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey. 426\nU.S. 660,6 65-66( 1976)( per curiam)( collecting cases). To the extent the State Plaintiffs attempt to bring parens\npatriae claims based on harm to their quasi-sovereign interests, those claims are not \"on behalf of specific\nimmigrants, but instead seek to protect the general welfare of their residents. In any event, as the court discusses\nbelow, the State Plaintiffs lack parens patriae standing to bring these claims.\n32\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 33 of 48 PageID #: 3827\ntraceable connection between the asserted injury-in-fact and the\nalleged actions of the defendant; and (3) redressabilitv. or a non-\nspeculative likelihood that the injury can be remedied by the\nrequested relief\"\nAllco Fin.

The \"first and foremost\" of these three requirements, \"injury-in-fact\" requires a plaintiff\nto \"show that he or she suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is 'concrete and\nparticularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.'\" Snokeo. Inc. v.\nRobins. 136 S. Ct. 1540,1548 (2016)( internal quotation marks and citation omitted)( quoting\nLuian. 504 U.S. at 560). To be \"imminent,\" the injury must be \"certainly impending\";\n\"allegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.\" Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA.5 68\nU.S. 398,409( 2013)( internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted). The second and\nthird requirements,\" causation\" and \"redressability,\" require a plaintiff to demonstrate that the\n\"injury-in-fact\" he or she suffers is \"fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and\nlikely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lexmark Int'l. Inc. v. Static Control\nComponents. Inc.. 134 S. Ct. 1377,1386( 2014)( citing Luian. 504 U.S. at 560). A plaintiff need\nnot, however, demonstrate that the defendant was the proximate or \"but-for\" cause oft he injury-\nin-fact. Id at 1391 n.6; Rothstein v. UBS AG.7 08 F.3d 82, 91-92( 2d Cir. 2013).\nThe court considers standing separately with respect to each claim raised in each case.\nDaimlerChrvsler Corp. v.

Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst. Rights. Inc.. 547\nU.S. 47, 53 n.3 (2006)( \"FAIR\"). The court therefore considers whether, for each claim raised in\neach of these two actions, at least one plaintiff has standing to sue.\n33\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 34 of 48 PageID #: 3828\n1.  Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs\na.  DACA Rescission Claims\nDefendants unsurprisingly do not contest that the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs have standing to\nchallenge the decision to rescind the DACA program. If the DACA program ends, the individual\nBatalla Vidal Plaintiffs almost certainly will lose their work authorization, the availability of\nwhich tums on their status as recipients of deferred action.  8 C.F.R. § 274a.l2(c)(14). Loss\nof their ability to work in the United States is clearly an \"injury-in-fact\" fairly traceable to the\nrescission oft he DACA program. Additionally, if they were to lose their deferred action, the\nindividual Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs would be subject to removal from the United States. There is\nnothing \"speculative\" about the possibility that they would actually be removed.

EPA. 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007). Here, there is \"some\npossibility\" that if Defendants had subjected the decision to rescind the DACA program to notice\nand comment and analyzed the impact of that decision on small entities, they would have\nreached a different outcome. Accordingly, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs also have Article III\nstanding to assert their procedural APA claim, and MRNY has Article III standing to assert its\nRFA claim.\nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot assert procedural APA claims because, if the\ndecision to rescind the DACA program was a \"substantive\" or \"legislative\" rule requiring notice-\nand-comment rulemaking, then,\" a fortiori so was enacting the policy in the first place,\" and the\nDACA program itself was thus \"void ab initio—leaving Plaintiffs without a remedy.\" (Defs.\nMem. at 28-29.) It does not follow, however, that if the rescission of the DACA program\nrequired notice and comment, the program's creation necessarily required notice and comment as\nwell. (See Defs. Mem. at 29 n.7.) While Defendants might be correct on the merits (an issue\nthat the court does not consider or resolve at this time), all that Article III requires is that\nPlaintiffs show that their alleged injury would be redressed by the ruling they seek—i^,t hat the\ndecision to rescind DACA should be vacated because it was procedurally defective.\nb.  Information-Use Policy Claim\nThe Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs also have standing to challenge the alleged changes to DHS's\ninformation-use policy. To obtain deferred action and work authorization under DACA,a n\napplicant was required to provide USCIS with extensive personal information, including his or\nher home address, height, weight, hair and eye color, fingerprints, photograph, and signature, and\nsubmit to a background check. (See USCIS, Form 1-82I D: Consideration of Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals( SAC, Ex. B (Dkt. 60-1)) at ECF pp.6-8; USCIS, Instructions for\n35\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 36 of 48 PageID #: 3830\nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals( SAC, Ex. B (Dkt. 60-1)) at ECF p.3.)\nThe Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs also allege that DACA applicants \"routinely provided\" other\npersonal information,\" including copies of school records, pay stubs, bank statements, passports,\nbirth certificates, and similar records,\" in support of their applications. (SAC H 70.) They\ncontend that this information will enable DHS to deport them more easily once their deferred\naction expires. (Id. ^ 127.) The court agrees. It is not difficult to infer that this information\nwould facilitate DHS's ability to remove these individuals from the country. This increased\nlikelihood of removal is sufficiently concrete, imminent, and traceable to Defendants' alleged\nconduct to establish standing.\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their information-use policy\nclaims because \"[n]o Plaintiff plausibly alleges that the agency has in fact used his DACA\ninformation for any enforcement purpose, much less initiated enforcement proceedings against\nhim as a result, or that there is any imminent threat of this occurring.\" (Defs. Mem. at 37.) The\nindividual Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs need not wait, however, until they are deported to have\nstanding to press this claim. Once their deferred action expires, they will be subject to removal\nfrom the United States, and the court will presume that Defendants will enforce the immigration\nlaws against them.  Hedges. 724 F.3d at 197. Nor will the court ignore the obvious reality\nthat many DACA recipients will be removed from the country when their deferred action\nexpires. (See, e.g.. State Pis. Am. Compl. H 71 (quoting a statement by Acting Director of ICE\nThomas Homan that undocumented immigrants \"should be uncomfortable\" and \"should look\nover [their] shoulder[s]\" and \"be worried\").) The threat of removal based on information\nprovided to DHS is sufficiently imminent as to constitute injury-in-fact.\n36\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 37 of 48 PageID #: 3831\nc.  Notice Claim\nThe Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs lack standing, however, to assert their notice claim. In their\nSecond Amended Complaint, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs allege that, following the enactment of\nthe DACA Rescission Memo, Defendants failed to send DACA recipients whose status expired\nby March 5,2018, individualized notices \"advising them that they must apply to renew DACA\nby October 5,2017 or be forever ineligible to renew their status.\" (SAC 1165;^  i d at 3,\n48,103-05,160-66.) As Defendants correctly note, however, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs have\nnot alleged that any of them missed the October 5, 2017, deadline or suffered other adverse\neffects from not receiving such individualized notice. (Defs. Mem. at 34-35.) Nor, even\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, does the Second Amended Complaint\nshow that MRNY was injured by Defendants' failure to provide DACA recipients with\nindividualized notice oft he renewal deadline.'^ While the Second Amended Complaint alleges\nthat\"  MRNY has not been able to reach four DACA recipients to inform them that they need to\nrenew now\"( SAC H 48), that does not support the reasonable inferences either that those\nindividuals failed to apply for renewal or that such failure was \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants'\nactions.  In the absence of a showing that anyone has been harmed by a failure to receive notice\nThe court also notes that the renewal deadline provided by the DACA Rescission Memo was not significantly\ndifferent than that provided by existing DHS policy. The State Plaintiffs allege that \"[p]rior to termination of\nDACA,a  DACA grantee whose renewal status expires in February 2018 would have received an individualized\nrenewal notice informing the grantee that he or she had to file a renewal 120-150 days prior to expiration ... in\norder to avoid a lapse in deferred action and employment authorization.\" (State Pis. Am. Compl.^  93.) Under the\nDACA Rescission Memo,a  DACA recipient whose deferred action and work authorization was set to expire on\nMarch 4, 2018, was required to file an application for renewal by October 5,2018— 150 days before those\nbenefits were set to expire.\nEven if those conditions were met, it is not clear that MRNY would have organizational standing to bring this\nclaim. S^ Summers v. Earth Island Inst.. 555 U.S. 488, 498( 2009)( \"[0]ur prior cases ... have required plaintiff-\norganizations to make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would\nsuffer harm.\")\n37\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 38 of 48 PageID #: 3832\nof the change to the application deadline, the Batalla Vidal Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that\nthey have Article III standing to bring this claim.\n2. State Plaintiffs\nThe court next considers whether the State Plaintiffs have Article III standing. As the\nCourt has noted, the ordinary rules of standing are somewhat different when a state is a plaintiff.\nStates are \"not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\" and they are\nentitled to \"special solicitude\" when they seek to vindicate their \"proprietary\" or \"quasi-\nsovereign\" interests.'^ Massachusetts v. EPA. 549 U.S. at 518. This does not mean, however,\nthat states have unbridled license to sue.\na.  The State Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the DACA Rescission\nThe State Plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge Defendants' decision to rescind\nthe DACA program, as well as the procedures by which that decision was made and\nimplemented, based on that decision's impacts to the State Plaintiffs' proprietary interests.\nStates, \"like other associations and private parties,\" may have a \"variety of proprietary interests\"\nthat they may vindicate in court. Alfred L. Snapp & Son. Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel.. Barez, 458\nU.S. 592, 601-02( 1982)( \"Snapp\"). A state has proprietary interests, for example, in its\nownership of land, id at 601, and in its relationships with its employees, see Indiana v. IRS. 38\nF. Supp. 3d 1003,1009( S.D. Ind. 2014)( \"The Defendants recognize, as they must, that a State\nThe Court has categorized a state's litigation interests using the trichotomy of\" sovereign,\" \"quasi-sovereign,\"\nand \"proprietary\" interests. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son. Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex re!.. Barez. 458 U.S. 592, 601\n(1982)( \"Snapp\"). Proprietary interests are those that a state may have akin to a private party, such as ownership of\nland or participation in a business venture. Id at 601. Sovereign interests are interests the state has in its capacity as\na state, such as \"the exercise of sovereign power over individuals and entities within the relevant jurisdiction\" and\n\"the demand for recognition from other sovereigns.\" Id \"Quasi-sovereign\" interests are harder to define but\n\"consist of a set of interests that the State has in the well-being of its populace.\" Id at 602; see also id. at 607\n(\"[T]he articulation of[ quasi-sovereign] interests is a matter for case-by-case development—neither an exhaustive\nformal definition nor a definitive list of qualifying interests can be presented in the abstract  \").\n38\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 39 of 48 PageID #: 3833\nand its political subdivisions may sue in their capacity as employers.\"). A state also has\nproprietary interests in its \"participat[ion] in a business venture,\" Snapp. 458 U.S. at 601, and in\nthe operation of state-run institutions, such as state colleges and universities, Washington. 847\nF.3d at 1159-61; Aziz v. Trump. 231 F. Supp. 3d 23, 32-33 (E.D. Va. 2017).\nHere, the State Plaintiffs have amply alleged and documented that the rescission of\nDACA would harm the states' proprietary interests as employers and in the operation of state-run\ncolleges and universities. (State Pis. Am. Compl. H 190 (states employ \"[m]any DACA\nrecipients\").). For example, the State of Washington represents that it employs DACA recipients\nwithin state government (e.g.. Decl. of Paul Quinonez  1-6 (State Pis. Am. Compl., Ex. 56\n(Dkt. 55-56)); Decl. of E. Alexandra Monroe ^ 3-4 (State Pis. Am. Compl., Ex. 62( Dkt. 55-62)))\nand at state-run colleges and universities (e.g.. Decl. of Lucila Loera K 4 (State Pis. Am. Compl.,\nEx. 58( Dkt. 55-58))). If DACA were rescinded, these employees would lose their work\nauthorization, and the State of Washington would incur expenses in identifying, hiring, and\ntraining their replacements. (State Pis. Am. Compl.^  190.) Accordingly, the State of\nWashington has standing to assert equal protection and substantive APA claims challenging the\ndecision to end the DACA program. Moreover, Washington has standing to challenge the\nprocedures by which Defendants decided to end the DACA program, because \"there is some\npossibility\" that, if DHS complied with notice-and-comment and RFA rulemaking procedures, it\nmight \"reconsider the decision.\" See Massachusetts v. EPA.5 49 U.S. at 518. Because\nWashington has established its standing to assert substantive and procedural APA and RFA\nclaims, the State Plaintiffs therefore have Article III standing to bring these claims.  FAIR,\n547 U.S. at 53 n.3.\n39\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 40 of 48 PageID #: 3834\nDefendants' arguments that State Plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they would\nbe only \"incidentally\" harmed by the rescission of the DACA program are without merit. (See\nDefs. Mem. at 19.) Defendants protest that \"[i]t would be extraordinary to find Article III\nstanding\" based on a state's assertions of\" alleged harms to their residents, employees, tax bases,\nhealth expenditures, and educational experiences at their universities,\" as \"virtually any\nadministration of federal law by a federal agency could have such effects.\" (Id.) That a federal\npolicy may have sweeping, adverse effects on states and state-run institutions is not, however, a\nconvincing argument that states should not have standing to challenge that policy. Moreover,\nDefendants' position is irreconcilable with their own stated rationale for rescinding the DACA\nprogram. Defendants have stated that they rescinded the DACA program because it suffered\nfrom the same legal flaws as the DAPA program and could not be defended in court against the\nthreatened challenge by Texas and other state plaintiffs. That necessarily assumes that at least\none of the plaintiff states in the Texas litigation has standing to challenge the existence of the\nDACA program. Cf. Texas. 809 F.3d at 150-62 (finding standing based on the likely costs of\nhaving to issue drivers licenses to DAPA beneficiaries). Defendants offer no convincing reason\nwhy states should have standing to challenge the DACA program but not to challenge the\ndecision to end that program.'^\nDefendants' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. (Defs. Mem. at 21.) First, Defendants argue that neither\nthe Acting Secretary nor the Attorney General \"expressly relied upon or gave any indication that they agreed with\nthe Fifth Circuit's justiciability rulings.\" (Id) Jurisdiction is, however, a prerequisite to a ruling on the merits, so\nthe plaintiff states could prevail in their threatened challenge to the DACA program only if they had standing.\nSecond, Defendants argue that \"it was far from arbitrary and capricious for the Acting Secretary to weigh litigation\nrisk based on judicial decisions without regard to whether those courts had been correct to assert Jurisdiction in the\nfu-st place,\" and that the Executive Branch has \"an independent duty to consider the legality of... policies\nregardless of whether they are judicially reviewable.\" (Id.) The DACA Rescission Memo does not indicate,\nhowever, that Defendants actually considered these issues when deciding to rescind the DACA program. Finally,\nDefendants argue that the adoption of the DACA program could have been reviewed as an abdication of DHS's\nstatutory responsibilities—a. grounds for justiciability that would not apply to the decision to rescind the program.\n(Id. at 21-22.) The Fifth Circuit expressly did not rely on that theory of standing, 809 F.3d at 150, nor is there any\nindication that the Attorney General or Acting Secretary considered it in rescinding the DACA program.\n40\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 41 of 48 PageID #: 3835\nb.  The State Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Bring Notice and Information-Use Policy Claims\nWhether the State Plaintiffs can assert their notice or information-use policy claims,\nhowever, is a close question. In order to assert these claims, the State Plaintiffs must identify\nsome cognizable proprietary or quasi-sovereign interest that was harmed by Defendants'\nchallenged conduct— (1) with respect to the notice claim. Defendants' communication of its\ndecision to rescind the DACA program and impose an October 5,2017, renewal deadline; and\n(2) with respect to the information-use policy claims, the alleged change in DHS policy\nregarding the use of DACA applicants' information. In the court's view, the State Plaintiffs have\nnot identified any interests harmed by these actions that they can sue the federal government to\nredress, and so they lack standing to bring these claims.\ni.  Proprietary Interests\nWhile the State Plaintiffs allege that their proprietary interests will be harmed by the\ntermination of DACA (State Pis. Am. Compl. Kt 15, ICQ), they do not identify any proprietary\ninterests that have been or will be harmed by Defendants' alleged failure to provide DACA\nrecipients with \"adequate notice\" of the \"procedures and timeline for renewing their DACA\nstatus,\" \"about the general termination of the DACA program after March 5, 2018,\" or \"of\n[DACA recipients'] inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018\"\n(id.  276-78; cL State Pis. Mem. at 19-21). It is certainly conceivable that many DACA\nrecipients who were eligible to renew their deferred action and work authorization under the\nDACA Rescission Memo failed to do so before the October 5, 2017 deadline. (State Pis. Am.\nCompl. K 96 (noting that \"up to one third of DACA grantees who are eligible for renewal had not\napplied as of two days before the ... deadline\").) The State Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does\nnot provide a sufficient basis for the court to conclude, however,t hat( 1)s uch failures to renew\nwere \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' decision not to provide each DACA recipient with\n41\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 42 of 48 PageID #: 3836\nindividualized notice of the change in application procedures and timelines; or( 2)t hat these\nfailures to renew harmed any State Plaintiffs proprietary interests (for example, by depriving a\nstate employee of work authorization).  Amnesty Inf L 568 U.S. at 410-16. Accordingly, the\nState Plaintiffs fail to assert a proprietary interest that would give them standing to bring their\nnotice claim.\nNor do the State Plaintiffs identify a cognizable proprietary interest harmed by the\nalleged change to DHS's information-use policy. The State Plaintiffs' information-use policy\nclaims challenge not the decision to rescind DACA itself, but the alleged changes in DHS's\ninformation-use policy, which. Plaintiffs allege, will facilitate the deportation of DACA\napplicants. As discussed above, the court accepts that these changes (if true) will likely result in\nmore undocumented immigrants' removal from the United States. (See State Pis. Am. Compl.\nH 86.) The State Plaintiffs have not, however, identified any cognizable harm to their proprietary\ninterests that would result from the removal of their undocumented residents. The State\nPlaintiffs have proffered evidence that the removal of DACA beneficiaries would grievously\naffect state economies. (See Deck of Dr. Ike Brannon  12, 14( State Pis. Am. Compl., Ex. 4\n(Dkt. 55-4))( estimating that the removal of DACA recipients from the United States \"would cost\n... the economy as a whole $215 billion in lost GDP,\" with impacts falling hardest on states\nwith the largest number of DACA recipients).) Despite the scale of these impacts, the State\nPlaintiffs' own authority makes clear that states lack standing to bring a \"claim ... that actions\ntaken by United States Government agencies had injured a State's economy and thereby caused a\nIn this circuit, the State Plaintiffs need not demonstrate, however, that the individuals they seek to protect must\nthemselves meet the injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability requirements of Article III.

Oklahoma. 502 U.S. 437,448 (1992). Absent\nsome showing of injury to their own proprietary interests (for example,\" direct injury in the form\nof a loss of specific tax revenues,\" id), the State Plaintiffs cannot maintain their information-use\npolicy claims based on alleged harms to their proprietary interests.\nii.  Quasi-Sovereign Interests\nAccordingly, the court will consider whether the State Plaintiffs can assert these claims\nparens patriae to vindicate their quasi-sovereign interests. States may bring parens patriae\n(literally, \"parent of the country\") suits to vindicate what the Court has characterized as \"quasi-\nsovereign\" interests. S^ Snapp. 458 U.S. at 600-02. There are no bright-line rules for which\ninterests qualify as \"quasi-sovereign.\" See id. at 600, 607; 13B Charles A. Wright et al.. Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3531.11.1, at 117( 3d ed. 2008)( \"Wright & Miller\"). In general,\nhowever, the Court has recognized that a state has quasi-sovereign interests in the \"health and\nwell-being—^both physical and economic—of its residents in general,\" in protecting state\n\"residents from the harmful effects of discrimination,\" and in challenging the discriminatory\ndenial of a state's \"rightful status within the federal system.\" Id at 607, 609. There are,\nhowever, at least two notable limitations on states' parens patriae standing.\nFirst, to be \"quasi-sovereign,\" the state's interests must be sufficiently generalized that\nthe state is seeking to vindicate its citizens' welfare, rather than simply pressing suit on behalf of\nits individual residents.  id at 607( \"[M]ore must be alleged than injury to an identifiable\ngroup of individual residents ....\"). A state cannot sue parens patriae when it is \"merely\nlitigating as a volunteer the personal claims of its citizens.\" Pennsylvania v. New Jersey. 426\nU.S. 660,6 65 (1976).\nSecond, special considerations are present when a state brings a parens patriae suit\nagainst the federal government. S^ 13B Wright & Miller § 3531.11.1, at 96. In Massachusetts\n43\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 44 of 48 PageID #: 3838\nV. Mellon. 262 U.S. 447( 1923), the Court rejected Massachusetts's attempt to bring a parens\npatriae suit challenging a federal statute as unconstitutional.  id. at 485-86. \"While the state,\nunder some circumstances, may sue in [a parens patriael capacity for the protection of its\ncitizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with\nthe federal government. In that field it is the United States, and not the state, which represents\nthem as parens patriae ....\" Id (emphasis added); see also Snapp, 458 U.S. at 609 n.l6( \"A\nState does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal\nGovernment.\"). The Court has rejected the argument, however, that Massachusetts v. Mellon\nbars all state parens patriae claims against the federal government. See Ariz. State Legislature v.\nAriz. Indep. Redistricting Comm'n, 135 S. Ct. 2652,2664 n.lO (2015)( observing that \"[t]he\ncases on the standing of states to sue the federal government seem to depend on the kind of claim\nthat the state advances\"( quoting Richard Fallon et al.. Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts\nand the Federal Svstem 263-66 (6th ed. 2009))). Compare Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at\n520 n.l7, with id. at 538-39( Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Instead, states may sue the federal\ngovernment parens patriae to enforce rights guaranteed by a federal statute. S^ Massachusetts\nV. EPA,5 49 U.S. at 520 n.l7: see also New York v. Sebelius. No. 1:07-CV-1003( GLS)( DRH),\n2009 WL 1834599, at *12( N.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009)( collecting cases). Massachusetts v. EPA\nexpressly did not disturb the settled rule, however, that a state may not sue parens patriae to\n\"protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes.\" Massachusetts v. EPA.5 49 U.S. at\n520 n.l7( quoting Georgia v. Penn. R. Co.. 324 U.S. 439, 447 (1945)).\nThe court concludes that the State Plaintiffs lack standing to bring either their notice and\ninformation-use policy claims. With respect to their notice claim, the State Plaintiffs have not\nargued or demonstrated that Defendants' alleged failure to provide DACA applicants with\n44\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 45 of 48 PageID #: 3839\nadequate notice of changes in the DACA program and renewal deadline has actually harmed \"the\nhealth and well-being\" of state residents or any other cognizable quasi-sovereign interest. See\nSnapp. 458 U.S. at 607. (Cf State Pis. Am. Compl.  15, 100; State Pis. Opp'n at 21-22.) Even\nif they had done so, they would be challenging federal enforcement of federal immigration laws\nas unconstitutional, which Massachusetts v. Mellon prohibits. S^ Massachusetts v. EPA. 549\nU.S. at 520 n.l7 (\"[T]here is a critical difference between allowing a State 'to protect her citizens\nfrom the operation of federal statutes'( which is what Mellon prohibits) and allowing a State to\nassert its rights under federal law (which it has standing to do).\"). For the same reason, the State\nPlaintiffs also lack standing to assert their information-use policy claims. Even assuming, as\ndiscussed above, that the change in information-use policy will facilitate the removal of\nundocumented immigrants from these states, and that this removal will harm the \"health and\nwell-being—^both physical and economic\" of state residents,^  S napp, 458 U.S. at 607, the\nthrust of the State Plaintiffs' information-use policy claims is to challenge as fundamentally\nunfair a change in federal policy that will facilitate the federal government's enforcement of the\nimmigration laws.\nThe State Plaintiffs' argument that they merely seek to \"enforce—as opposed to overturn\nor avoid—application of a federal statute\" is unpersuasive. (State Pis. Opp'n at 21 n.l 1)\nPlaintiffs plainly seek to invalidate federal action as unconstitutional. Such claims more closely\nresemble constitutional challenges to application of federal statutes, which Massachusetts v.\nMellon prohibits states from asserting parens patriae. than suits to enforce compliance with\nfederal statutory law, which Massachusetts v. EPA permits states to bring parens patriae. When\nchallenging federal action on constitutional grounds,\" it is no part of[ the state's] duty or power\nto enforce [its citizens'] rights in respect of their relations with the federal government.\"\n45\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 46 of 48 PageID #: 3840\nMassachusetts v.

Whether State Plaintiffs Have Cause of Action under the APA\nLastly, Defendants assert that neither MRNY's nor the State Plaintiffs' claims are\njusticiable because those Plaintiffs do not assert interests that are \"arguably within the zone of\ninterests ... protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\" (Defs. Mem. at 21 (quoting\nClarke v. Sees. Indus. Ass'n. 479 U.S. 388, 395 (1987)( first alteration added)).) To bring suit\nunder the APA,a  plaintiff\" must satisfy not only Article Ill's standing requirements, but an\nadditional test: [t]he interest he asserts must be 'arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected or regulated by the statute' that he says was violated.\" Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\nBand of Pottawatomi Indians v.

Ass'n. 479 U.S. at 399).\nCritically, for the court's current purposes, whether MRNY and the State Plaintiffs assert\ninterests falling within the \"zone of interests\" protected by the APA is not a question of\n\"jurisdiction\" or \"justiciability.\" As the Supreme Court has explained, the question of whether a\nplaintiff falls within the zone of interests protected by a statute is not properly classed as an issue\n46\n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 85   Filed 11/09/17   Page 47 of 48 PageID #: 3841\nof\" prudential standing,\" but is instead an issue of\" whether a legislatively conferred cause of\naction encompasses a particular plaintiffs claim.\" Lexmark InfL  134 S.

That issue\n\"goes not to the court's jurisdiction—^that is,' power'—^to adjudicate a case, but instead to\nwhether the plaintiff has adequately pled a claim.\" Chabad Lubavitch of Litchfield Cntv., Inc. v.\nLitchfield Historic Dist.

Supp. 3d 632, 637-\n38 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)( arguments for dismissal for lack of\" prudential standing\" were\nappropriately addressed under Rule 12(b)(6), not Rule 12(b)(1), of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure). Because this argument does not raise an issue of\" jurisdiction or justiciability,\" the\ncourt does not address it here.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above. Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction (Dkt. 95) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The following claims\nare dismissed:\n• B atalla Vidal v. Duke.

The court RESERVES RULING on Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim.\nSO ORDERED.\ns/Nicholas G. Garaufis\nDated: Brooklyn, New York  NICHOLAS G.

(Pezzi, Stephen) (Entered: \n04/10/2018) \n04/10/2018     ORDER re 216 MOTION to Stay Answer Deadline Pending Appeal -- \nAny party seeking to be heard on the instant motion shall submit its \nresponse by April 11, 2018.

(Drake, Shaw) (Entered: 04/10/2018) \n04/12/2018     ORDER granting in part and denying in part 216 Motion to Stay -- I agree \nwith the Batalla Vidal plaintiffs that the defendants' proposal to stay the \ndeadline for answering pending the resolution of appeals currently before \nthe circuit court is inefficient and unnecessary. In the absence of such \nrelief, the parties will be ready to resume discovery as soon as the appeals \nare resolved, while granting the motion will cause additional delay. It is \nreasonable to require the defendants to take the steps necessary to avoid \nexacerbating the needless delays they have already caused. However, that \nresult can be achieved by granting the alternative relief the defendants \npropose of a 45-day extension of the time to answer. There is no \n\nreasonable prospect of the appeals being resolved by the deadline \nthe Batalla Vidal plaintiffs suggest (April 20, 2018). Accordingly, I deny \nthe defendants' request for an indefinite stay, but grant their alternative \nrequest of a 45-day extension. The defendants' shall file their amended \nanswers by May 29, 2018.

DUKE, in her official capacity; U.S. \nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION \nSERVICES; U.S. IMMIGRATION \nAND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; \nand the UNITED STATES OF \nAMERICA, \n \n  Defendants. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The States of New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia (the “States”) bring this action to protect \nthe States—including their residents, employers, small governmental jurisdictions, regulatory \nsystems, and educational institutions—against the unlawful actions of the President of the United \nStates and the federal government.  \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 2 of 79 PageID #: 1621\n2.  Since 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program has \nprotected from deportation and extended work authorization to approximately 800,000 young \npeople who grew up in this country, most of whom have known no home other than the United \nStates.  \n3.  DACA has allowed these young people to live, study, and work in the States (and \nthroughout the country) as contributors and leaders in their communities. DACA grantees attend \npublic and private universities, and are employed by companies, nonprofit organizations, and \ngovernmental agencies and institutions, all of which benefit from their skills and productivity. \nDACA grantees also provide financial support to their families, help to grow the economy, and \ncontribute significantly to State and local revenues and tax bases.  \n4.  On September 5, 2017, the Defendants definitively and categorically terminated the \nDACA program, as detailed in a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Memorandum \n(“DHS Memorandum”).  See Ex. 74 (Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine Kelly to James \nMcCament, Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Rescission of Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, September 5, 2017).  \n5.  Pursuant  to  the  DHS  Memorandum,  the  federal  government  will  only  issue \nrenewals for grantees whose benefits expire before March 5, 2018, provided they apply for renewal \nby October 5, 2018. DHS immediately ceased accepting all new applications under DACA. \n6.  Ending DACA is a culmination of President’s Trump’s oft-stated commitments—\nwhether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination \nthereof—to punish and disparage immigrants, especially those with Mexican roots, who make up \nmore than 78 percent of DACA grantees. See Ex. 1 (Updated USCIS, Consideration of Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017, June 8, 2017).  \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 3 of 79 PageID #: 1622\n7.  The consequence of the President’s decision is that hundreds of thousands of young \npeople who have availed themselves of the program will ultimately lose its protections, and will \nbe exposed to removal when their authorizations expire.  \n8.  Individuals who have relied on DACA are now even more vulnerable to removal \nthan before the program was initiated, as they turned over sensitive information to the federal \ngovernment in their applications. Despite the federal government’s repeated promises that it would \nnot use such information to conduct enforcement measures, the DHS Memorandum does not \nexplain how the government will keep that information secure, nor does it provide any assurances \nthat immigration enforcement agents will not use such information to find and remove those who \napplied for DACA.  \n9.  Terminating DACA will harm hundreds of thousands of the States’ residents, injure \nState-run colleges and universities, upset the States’ workplaces, damage the States’ economies, \nhurt State-based businesses and nonprofits, negatively affect the States’ small governmental \njurisdictions, and disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory interests.  \n10.  The States respectfully request that the Court invalidate the portions of the DHS \nMemorandum challenged here. Further, the States ask that the Court enjoin the federal government \nfrom using personal information gathered for the DACA program in immigration enforcement. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n12.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and 1391(e)(1). \nDefendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. The State of \nNew York is a resident of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to this Complaint occurred within the Eastern District of New York. \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 4 of 79 PageID #: 1623\n13.  The States bring this action to redress harms to their proprietary and sovereign \ninterests and their interests as parens patriae.  \nPARTIES \nPLAINTIFFS \n14.  The  Plaintiff  States  of  New  York,1  Massachusetts,  Washington,  Colorado, \nConnecticut,  Delaware,  Hawaii,  Illinois,  Iowa,  New  Mexico,  North  Carolina,  Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia, represented by and \nthrough their Attorneys General,2 are sovereign states3 of the United States of America.  \n15.  The States are aggrieved and have standing to bring this action because of the \ninjuries to the States caused by the termination of DACA, including immediate and irreparable \ninjuries to their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests.  \nDEFENDANTS \n16.  Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and authorized the \nissuance of the DHS Memorandum that purports to terminate DACA. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \n17.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \nDACA program. DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government, and is an \nagency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n                                                 \n1 The State of New York is represented by and through its Attorney General, Eric T. Schneiderman.  \nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo is the chief executive officer of the State of New York and  is responsible for overseeing \nthe operations of the State of New York and ensuring that its laws are faithfully executed.  \n2 Colorado is represented by and through Governor John W. Hickenlooper’s Chief Legal Counsel, who has \nbeen designated a Special Assistant Attorney General for purposes of representing Colorado in this matter. \n3 The District of Columbia, which is a municipal corporation empowered to sue and be sued, and is the \nlocal government for the territory constituting the permanent seat of the federal government of the United States, \nshall be included herein as a “State” for ease of reference.   \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 5 of 79 PageID #: 1624\n18.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is an \nOperational and Support Component agency within DHS. USCIS is the sub-agency responsible \nfor administering the DACA program. \n19.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is an Operational \nand Support Component agency within DHS. ICE is responsible for enforcing federal immigration \nlaw, including identifying, apprehending, detaining, and removing non-citizens. \n20.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the Acting Secretary of the DHS. She is responsible \nfor implementing and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act, and oversees USCIS and \nICE. She is sued in her official capacity. \n21.  Defendant the United States of America includes all government agencies and \ndepartments responsible for the implementation and termination of the DACA program. \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \nEstablishment of the DACA Program. \n22.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \nmemorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”). See Ex. 13 \n(2012 DACA Memorandum). Under DACA, “certain young people who were brought to this \ncountry as children and know only this country as home” could request deferred action for a period \nof  two  years,  subject  to  renewal.  Id.  at  1-2.  DACA  grantees  also  were  eligible  for  work \nauthorizations so that they could work legally in the United States during the deferred action \nperiod, pursuant to long-standing federal regulation.  See id.; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (providing \nthat “an alien who has been granted deferred action” may obtain work authorization upon \ndemonstrating economic necessity). \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 6 of 79 PageID #: 1625\n23.  Deferred action is a well-established form of prosecutorial discretion under which \nthe federal government forbears from taking removal action against an individual for a designated \nperiod of time. According to the 2012 DACA memorandum, it was appropriate for the government \nto exercise such discretion for DACA grantees because immigration laws are not “designed to \nremove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the \nlanguage.”  See Ex. 13 at 1.   \n24.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum provided that an applicant could be considered for \nan exercise of prosecutorial discretion only if he or she:  \na.  came to the United States before the age of sixteen;  \nb.  continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding  \nJune 15, 2012, and was present in the United States on that date;  \nc.  was in enrolled in school on the date of his/her application, had graduated from \nhigh school, had obtained a general education development certificate, or was \nan honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the \nUnited States;  \nd.  had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, \nor multiple misdemeanor offenses, and did not otherwise pose a threat to \nnational security or public safety; and  \ne.  was not over the age of thirty on June 15, 2012. \nId. at 1.  \n25.  USCIS  described  DACA  as  follows:  “Deferred  action  is  a  discretionary \ndetermination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For \npurposes of future inadmissibility based upon unlawful presence, an individual whose case has \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 7 of 79 PageID #: 1626\nbeen deferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred action \nis in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in \nthe United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the period \ndeferred action is in effect. However, deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an \nindividual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.” See Ex. \n14, Question 1 (USCIS Help Center, DACA FAQs). \nThe DACA Application Process. \n26.  Under DACA, “[a]ll individuals who believe[d] they [met] the guidelines” could \n“affirmatively request consideration of DACA from USCIS” through an established process. After \nreceiving the applicant’s forms, evidence, supporting documents and application fee, USCIS \n“review[ed] them for completeness,” considered complete applications “on an individual, case-by-\ncase basis,” and notified applicants of its determination in writing. See Ex. 16 (USCIS Help Center, \nHow do I request consideration of DACA?). \n27.  In order to apply for the DACA program, applicants had to submit extensive \ndocumentation establishing that they met the eligibility criteria. Applicants also had to submit a \nForm I-765 Application for Employment Authorization, and pay a $495 fee. See Ex. 14 at \nQuestions  28-41;  see  also  Ex.  17  (USCIS,  I-821D,  Consideration  of  Deferred  Action  for \nChildhood Arrivals) (explaining that the filing fee for a DACA application could not be waived).   \n28.  DACA applicants were required to undergo biometric and biographic background \nchecks. When conducting these checks, DHS reviewed the applicant’s biometric and biographic \ninformation “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government \nagencies.” See Ex. 14 at Question 23. If any information “indicate[d] that [the applicant’s] presence \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 8 of 79 PageID #: 1627\nin the United States threaten[ed] public safety or national security,” the applicant was ineligible \nfor DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.” Id. at Question 65. \n29.  Once  individuals  were  admitted  into  the  DACA  program,  internal  USCIS \n“Standard Operating Procedures” dictated that, absent an “Egregious Public Safety” issue, DACA \ngrantees were not to be terminated from the program until the government provided a “Notice of \nIntent to Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[ed]” the grounds for the termination.” See Ex. 18 \nat 132, Appendix I (DHS, National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals, Apr. 4, 2013). DHS policy further provided that recipients of such notice \nshould be afforded 33 days to “file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in the Notice \nof Intent to Terminate” prior to termination of participation in the DACA program. Id. \n30.  At the expiration of their two-year DACA term, grantees could seek renewal, and \nwere considered for renewal if they met the guidelines for consideration as well as other specified \ncriteria. See Ex. 19 (USCIS Help Center, How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of \nDACA?). \nBenefits Provided Under the DACA Program. \n31.  DACA confers numerous benefits on its grantees.  \n32.  Notably, DACA grantees are granted the right not to be arrested or detained based \nsolely on their immigration status during the time period during which their deferred action is in \neffect. See Ex. 14 at Question 9. \n33.  DACA grantees also are granted eligibility for work authorization. As USCIS has \nexplained,  “an  individual  whose  case  has  been  deferred  is  eligible  to  receive  employment \nauthorization for the period of deferred action . . . .’” Id. at Question 1.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 9 of 79 PageID #: 1628\n34.  DACA grantees are eligible to receive certain public benefits. These include Social \nSecurity, retirement, and disability benefits. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d).  \n35.  DACA enables grantees to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards, start businesses, \npurchase  homes  and  cars,  and  conduct  other  aspects  of  daily  life  that  are  otherwise  often \nunavailable for undocumented immigrants. See Ex. 5 ¶ ¶  12, 16, 22 (Decl. Wong). \n36.  DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands of young people “to enroll in colleges \nand universities, complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and \ngive back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs—\nall on the books.” See Ex. 15 (Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson to Rep. Judy Chu, Dec. \n30, 2016). \n37.  These positive effects have rippled throughout the States’ economies. As DHS \nrecognized more than four years after the implementation of DACA, our nation “continue[s] to \nbenefit . . . from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing \nmore than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Id.  \n38.  Terminating  DACA  would  not  only  rip  away  the  life-changing  benefits  to \nindividual DACA grantees, but would also reverse the benefits to the community at large, \nincluding to innumerable small businesses, non-profits, and governments.4  \n \n                                                 \n4 See e.g., Ex. 20 (Ike Brannon, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA, the Cato Institute, Jan. 18, \n2017) (“The deportation of DACA participants would cost the American economy billions of dollars, as well as \nbillions of tax dollars foregone, while doing little to address the true concerns that Americans may have about \nunauthorized immigrants.”); Ex. 21 (Tom Wong, et al., DACA Grantees’ Economic and Educational Gains Continue \nto Grow, Center for American Progress,  Aug. 28, 2017) (quoting multiple DACA grantees whose small businesses \nwill suffer or even close if DACA is terminated); Ex. 22 (Tom Wong et al., New Study of DACA Beneficiaries Shows \nPositive Economic and Educational Outcomes, Center for American Progress, Oct. 18, 2016) (study showing that 9 \npercent of DACA grantees work at non-profits, a significant percentage work in education, and 6 percent started their \nown business, including one owner who employs nine people and hopes to continue to grow and “hire even more \npeople from the community” [internal brackets and quotation marks omitted]). \n \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 10 of 79 PageID #: 1629\nThe Government’s Assurances That the Information Provided by DACA Applicants Would \nbe Kept Confidential and Not Used for Enforcement. \n \n39.  When the DACA program was first implemented, many eligible young people were \nreluctant to voluntarily disclose information that could help facilitate their removal from the United \nStates. To encourage applications, DHS repeatedly promised applicants that information they \nprovided as part of the DACA application process would “not later be used for immigration \nenforcement purposes.” See Ex.  15 (Letter from Sec’y Johnson). \n40.  USCIS  affirmatively  represented  to  DACA  applicants  that,  except  in  limited \ncircumstances, “[i]nformation provided in [a DACA request] is protected from disclosure to ICE \nand CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.” See Ex. 25 (USCIS Help \nCenter, Will the information I share in my request for DACA be used for immigration enforcement \npurposes?). \n41.  USCIS  affirmatively  represented  to  DACA  applicants  that,  except  in  limited \ncircumstances, their case would not be “referred to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings” even \nif UCSIS decided not to defer action on a case. See Ex. 26 (USCIS Help Center, If USCIS does not \nexercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?). \n42.  In the exceptional circumstance in which USCIS referred a DACA applicant to ICE, \nUSCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that “information related to [their] family \nmembers or guardians that is contained in [their] request [would] not be referred to ICE for \npurposes of immigration enforcement against family members or guardians.” See Ex. 27 (USCIS \nHelp Center, If my DACA case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes or if I \nreceive an NTA, will information related to my family members and guardians also be referred to \nICE for immigration enforcement purposes?). \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 11 of 79 PageID #: 1630\n43.  USCIS affirmatively represented to employers of DACA applicants that, except in \nlimited circumstances, if they provided an employee \"with information regarding his or her \nemployment to support a request for consideration of DACA,” the information would not be \n“shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes.” See Ex. 28 (USCIS Help Center, If \nI provide my employee with information regarding his or her employment to support a request for \nconsideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes \nagainst me and/or my company?). \n44.  The  government’s  representations  that,  absent  exceptional  circumstances, \ninformation provided by  a DACA  grantee  would not be used against him or her for later \nimmigration enforcement proceedings were unequivocal and atypical. For example, the federal \ngovernment does not make the same representations for participants in other similar programs, \nsuch as Temporary Protected Status. These assurances were key to the success of the DACA \nprogram. By making repeated, unique, and strong representations, the federal government induced \npersons to rely on those representations and apply to become DACA grantees despite the potential \nrisks. \nThe Government’s Commitment to Continuity and Fair Treatment for DACA Grantees. \n45.  Numerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced the federal \ngovernment’s promise to provide continuity and fair treatment to DACA grantees, and have \nrecognized that DACA grantees have relied on the government’s representations in applying for \nDACA. For example, in December 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles \nJohnson acknowledged that there are hundreds of thousands of DACA grantees who have “relied \non the U.S. government’s representations” about DACA, and asserted that “representations made \nby the U.S. government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 12 of 79 PageID #: 1631\nhonored.” See Ex.  15. \n46.  On December 19, 2016, then-President-elect Trump stated in an interview with \nTIME magazine that he would find an accommodation for DACA grantees, stating, “We’re going \nto work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud.” See Ex. 29 (Michael Scherer, \nPerson of the Year 2016, TIME Magazine, Dec. 19, 2016). He further recognized, “[DACA \ngrantees] got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. \nSome were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because \nthey don’t know what’s going to happen.” Id. \n47.  Again, on January 18, 2017, then President-elect Trump promised in an interview \nwith Fox & Friends that he was working on a plan to make DACA grantees “very happy.” See Ex. \n30 (Francesca Chambers, Trump signals he’s softening on immigration as he says he’s ‘working \non a plan’ that will make DREAMers ‘very happy,’  Daily Mail, Jan. 18, 2017). He further stated, \n“We’re working on a plan right now. And that plan, over the next two to three months, is going to \ncome out. And it’s a plan that’s going to be very firm, but it’s going to have a lot of heart.” Id. \n48.  In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the government must \nensure that “the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” DACA grantees, who have “organize[d] \n[their] li[ves] around” the DACA program. See Ex. 31 (CNN, Transcript of CNN Town Hall with \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, Jan. 12, 2017).   \n49.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump again stated in an interview with David Muir \nthat “[DACA grantees] shouldn’t be very worried. I do have a big heart.” See Ex. 32 (ABC News, \nTranscript of ABC News anchor David Muir interview with Donald Trump, Jan. 25, 2017). \n50.  In February 2017, then-Secretary of DHS  John Kelly issued  a memorandum \nrelating  to  enforcement  priorities.   This  memorandum  terminated  “all  existing  conflicting \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 13 of 79 PageID #: 1632\ndirectives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and \npriorities for removal,” including prior enforcement priorities, but left DACA unchanged. See Ex. \n2 (Memorandum from Secretary John Kelly to Keven McAleenan, Acting CBP Commissioner, \nEnforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest, Feb. 20, 2017); see also Ex. \n10 (Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior \nof the United States, Feb. 21, 2017) (“Q22: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)? A22: No.”).  \n51.  On  March  29,  2017,  Secretary  Kelly  reaffirmed  that  “DACA  status”  is  a \n“commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person, or the so-called Dreamer.” See \nEx.  33  (Ted  Hesson  &  Seung  Min  Kim,  Wary  Democrats  Look  to  Kelly  for  Answers  on \nImmigration, Politico, Mar. 29, 2017).    \n52.  On April 21, 2017, President Trump represented that his Administration’s policy \nwas not to deport DACA grantees, and suggested that they “should rest easy.” See Ex. 34 (The \nAssociated Press, Interview Transcript, Apr. 21, 2017). \n53.  On June 15, 2017, Secretary Kelly issued a memo terminating  the Deferred Action \nfor Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) program created in 2014, \nbut keeping DACA in place. See Ex. 23 (Memorandum from Secretary John Kelly to Keven \nMcAleenan,  Acting  CBP  Commissioner,  Rescission  of  November  20,  2014  Memorandum \nProviding for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, June \n15, 2017). \n54.  The government’s commitment to the DACA program was further communicated \nto young people through DHS’s publication entitled “National Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)” (the “DACA SOP”). See Ex. 18. This \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 14 of 79 PageID #: 1633\ndocument includes more than 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or denying deferred \naction. \n55.  Moreover, the approval notice granting deferred action under DACA listed only \n“fraud or misrepresentation” in the application process or “[s]ubsequent criminal activity” as \ngrounds for revoking DACA. See Ex. 24 (USCIS, DACA Approval Notice). \n56.  In reliance on these representations, hundreds of thousands of young people applied \nto participate in the DACA program, or sought renewal of their benefits since 2017. See Ex. 1.  \nPresident Trump’s Statements about Mexicans. \n57.  Despite these various and repeated promises to DACA grantees made by the federal \ngovernment and by President Trump, including a recognition of DACA’s continued legal viability, \nvalue, and successes, President Trump has a long history of disparaging Mexicans, who comprise \nthe vast majority of DACA grantees.  \n58.  In  announcing  his  presidential  campaign,  then-candidate  Trump  compared \nMexican immigrants to rapists, stating: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their \nbest. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re \nbringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. \nAnd some, I assume, are good people.” See Ex. 35 (Washington Post, Transcript of Donald \nTrump’s Presidential Bid Announcement, June 16, 2015). \n59.  During the first Republican presidential debate, then-candidate Trump again stated \nhis distaste for immigrants from Mexico: “The Mexican government is much smarter, much \nsharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for \nthem. They don’t want to take care of them.” See Ex. 36 (Andrew O’Reilly, At GOP debate, Trump \nsays ‘stupid’ U.S. leaders are being duped by Mexico, Fox News, Aug. 6, 2015). \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 15 of 79 PageID #: 1634\n60.   Soon after, on August 25, 2015, then-candidate Trump refused to answer questions \nabout immigration posed by Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-American and the top news anchor at \nUnivision, a Spanish-language news network. After sending his bodyguard to physically remove \nMr. Ramos, then-candidate Trump derisively told Mr. Ramos to “Go back to Univision.” See Ex. \n37 (Phillip Rucker, First, Trump booted Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out of his news conference. \nThen things got interesting, The Washington Post, Aug. 25, 2015).  \n61.  In May 2016, then-candidate Trump referred to anti-Trump protestors who carried \nthe Mexican flag as “criminals” and “thugs.” See Ex. 38 (Donald Trump, “The protestors in New \nMexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican Flag,” Twitter, May 25, 2016); See Ex. 39 \n(Donald Trump, “Many of the thugs that attacked peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were \nillegals,” Twitter, June 4, 2016). \n62.  In June 2016, then-candidate Trump impugned the integrity of a federal judge \npresiding over a lawsuit against one of his businesses because the judge is Hispanic. Trump \ncommented that Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s rulings against him “[H]as to do with perhaps that I’m \nvery, very strong on the border. . . Now, he is Hispanic, I believe. He is a very hostile judge to \nme.” See Ex. 40 (Jose A.  DelReal and Katie Zezima, Trump’s personal, racially tinged attacks on \nfederal judge alarm legal experts, The Washington Post, June 1, 2016).   \n63.  In an interview with CBS News on June 5, 2016, then-candidate Trump again \nreiterated his anti-Mexican views, noting that “[Judge Curiel]’s a member of a club or society very \nstrongly, pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias.” See Ex. 41 (CBS News, \nTranscript of Face the Nation, June 5, 2016). Judge Curiel is a member of the San Diego Chapter \nof the La Raza Lawyers Association. See Ex. 42 (Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Trump supporters’ false \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 16 of 79 PageID #: 1635\nclaim that Trump U judge is a member of a pro-immigrant group, The Washington Post, June 7, \n2016). \n64.  On August 21, 2015, two men urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then beat him \nwith a metal pole. They later told police that “Donald Trump was right; all these illegals need to \nbe deported.” When asked about the incident, then-candidate Trump failed to condemn the men, \ninstead describing them as “passionate.” See Ex. 43 (Adrian Walker, ‘Passionate’ Trump fans \nbehind homeless man’s beating?, The Boston Globe, Aug. 21, 2015). Specifically, Trump stated, \n“[i]t would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They \nlove this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate. Id. \n65.  In October 2016, during a presidential debate, then-candidate Trump responded to \na question about immigration by stating: “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get \nthem out.” See Ex. 44 (Katie Zezima, Trump on immigration: There are ‘bad hombres’ in the \nUnited States, The Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2017). \n66.  On January 27, 2017, newly-inaugurated President Trump and Mexico’s President \nPeña Nieto discussed President Trump’s proposal for a border wall over the phone. During that \ntranscribed conversation, President Trump again referred to “hombres” stating: “You have some \npretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with \nthat big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking \nthem out.” See Ex. 45 (Greg Miller et. al., Full Transcripts of Trump’s Calls with Mexico and \nAustralia, The Washington Post, Aug. 3, 2017).  \n67.  On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff \nJoe Arpaio, who was to be sentenced for criminal contempt for failing to comply with a federal \njudge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos. See Ex. 46 (Julie Hirschfield Davis and Maggie \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 17 of 79 PageID #: 1636\nHaberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio, Who Became Face of Crackdown on Illegal Immigration, \nThe N.Y. Times, Aug. 25, 2017).  \n68.  Sheriff Arpaio had been detaining people ostensibly because they had violated the \nlaw. But in practice, his office detained huge numbers of individuals solely because they looked \nLatino, without any reasonable suspicion of illegal conduct. See generally Melendres v. Arpaio, \nFindings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:07-cv-02513-GMS, ECF Doc. No.579 (D. Az. May 24, \n2013). After a federal court enjoined that practice in 2011, Arpaio continued his unlawful and \ndiscriminatory practices unabated, “announc[ing] to the world and to his subordinates that he was \ngoing to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise.” United States v. Arpaio, \nFindings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:16-cr-01012-SRB, ECF Doc. No. 210 at 13 (D. Az. July \n31, 2017). On July 31, 2017, a federal court held Arpaio in criminal contempt, holding that he had \nwillfully acted in “flagrant disregard” of the injunction. Id. \n69.  Before issuing the pardon, President Trump asked, “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for \ndoing his job?” See Ex. 46. (Davis and Haberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio). After issuing the \npardon, President Trump sent a tweet calling Mr. Arpaio “an American patriot.” Id. \n70.  As President Trump’s statements about Mexico and those with Mexican origins \ndemonstrate, the President is willing to disparage Mexicans in a misguided attempt to secure \nsupport from his constituency.   \nTrump Administration’s Threatening Statements about Deporting Immigrants. \n71.  On June 13, 2017, Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan testified in front of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, stating as to “every \nimmigrant in the country without papers,” that they “should be uncomfortable. You should look \nover your shoulder. And you need to be worried.” Hearing on the ICE and CBP F.Y. 2018 Budget \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 18 of 79 PageID #: 1637\nBefore the Subcomm. on Homeland Security of the H. Comm. on Appropriations, 115th Cong. \n(2017) 2017 WLNR 18737622.  \n72.  On April 19, 2017, United States Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions stated in \nan interview on Fox News’ “Happening Now,” program—in response to a question regarding the \ndeportation of a DACA recipient—that “[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being \ndeported, so people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not \nsubject to being deported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t promise people who are here unlawfully \nthat they aren’t going to be deported.”  Ex. 49 (Adam Shaw, Sessions defends immigration policies \nafter reported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News, Apr. 19, 2017).  \nPresident Trump Terminates DACA in Response to the Litigation Threats of a State Found \nTo  Have Discriminated Against Latinos/Hispanics Nine Times Since 2012. \n \n73.  On June 29, 2017, the Attorneys General of ten states, led by the State of Texas, \nsent U.S. Attorney General Sessions a letter threatening to add claims to litigation currently \npending in the Southern District of Texas “to challenge both the DACA program and the remaining \nexpanded DACA permits,” if the Executive Branch did not agree to end the DACA program by \nSeptember 5, 2017. Ex. 177 (Letter from Ken Paxton et.al. to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, June \n29, 2017). \n74.  The  demand  that  President  Trump  eliminate  DACA  is  part  of  a  history  of \nintentional discrimination against Latinos/Hispanics by the State of Texas. \n75.  Over the preceding decade, federal courts have repeatedly found the State of Texas \nliable for engaging in unlawful discrimination based on race and/or national origin. \n76.  For example, in Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133, 161 (D.D.C. 2012), \nthree federal judges blocked a Congressional and State House redistricting plan after finding that \nit “was enacted with discriminatory purpose.” \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 19 of 79 PageID #: 1638\n77.  The litigation eventually culminated in a ruling by a three-judge panel on August \n15, 2017 finding, again, that the 2010 congressional districts had been created with “racially \ndiscriminatory intent” against Latinos and African American voters. Perez v. Abbott, SA-11-CV- \n360, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129982, at *55 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2017). \n78.  On  October  9,  2014,  in  separate  litigation  challenging  a  state  voter  photo \nidentification (“ID”) law, a Texas federal district court judge found that the provision had been \n“imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and “constitute[d] an unconstitutional \npoll tax.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 633 (S.D. Tex. 2014). \n79.  On remand from the Fifth Circuit, a federal district court concluded that the 2011 \nLegislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters by requiring presentation of a photo \nID when casting their ballots. Veasey v. Abbott, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54253, at *14-18 (S.D. \nTex. Apr. 10, 2017). \n80.  DHS issued the DHS Memorandum terminating DACA on September 5, 2017, in \ndirect response to the threats of the State of Texas and the other ten states, fulfilling the demand \nof a State marked with a history of racial and national origin discrimination. \nPresident Trump Backtracks on His Promise and Terminates DACA.  \n81.  Attorney General Sessions announced the termination of DACA via a live press \nconference. He explained, without evidence, “The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, \namong other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that \nyielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.”  See Ex. 75 (DOJ, Attorney General \nSessions Delivers Remarks on DACA, Prepared Remarks, Sept. 5, 2017). \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 20 of 79 PageID #: 1639\n82.  Under  the  DHS  Memorandum,  which  accompanied  this  announcement,  the \ngovernment’s new policy provides no discretion to approve new applications on a case-by-case \nbasis.  Instead, the DHS Memorandum is a final decision that an entire class of people is no longer \neligible  for  deferred  action,  employment  authorization,  and  other  benefits.   Per  the  DHS \nMemorandum, DHS “[w]ill reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization Documents filed after the date of this memorandum.”  DHS will also \nreject all renewal applications it receives after October 5, 2017, and all renewal applications for \nauthorizations that expire after March 5, 2018.  See Ex. 74 (DHS Memorandum). \n83.  In issuing the DHS Memorandum, the federal government misleadingly claimed \nthat DACA was unconstitutional, see Ex. 74, despite the fact that no court has made that \ndetermination, and despite previous determinations by DOJ and DHS, including under the Trump \nadministration, that DACA is lawful and should be left in place.  In fact, as recently as June 15, \n2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly chose to allow DACA to continue (while \nterminating  the DAPA program) “after consulting with the Attorney General.”  See Ex. 23 \n84.  Even after the announcement, the government’s position on the reasoning for the \ntermination has been unclear and inconsistent.  On the day of the termination, President Trump re-\ntweeted a statement that “We are a nation of laws.  No longer will we incentivize illegal \nimmigration.”  See Ex. 47 (Josh Saul, Jeff Sessions Always Wanted to Deport Undocumented \nImmigrant Youth. Now He Can, Newsweek, Sept. 5, 2017).  The President appears to have deleted \nthis tweet.  Later on September 5, the President tweeted, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize \nDACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can’t, I will revisit this \nissue!” See Ex. 48 (Donald J. Trump, Twitter, Sept. 5, 2017). On September 14, 2017, he tweeted, \n“Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 21 of 79 PageID #: 1640\njobs, some serving in the military? Really! .....” See Ex. 50 (Donald J. Trump, Twitter, Sept. 14, \n2017). \n85.  As a result of the DHS Memorandum, DACA grantees whose benefits expire after \nMarch 5, 2018 will immediately lose their employment authorization, as well as other vital \nbenefits, such as social security cards, driver’s licenses, financial aid, disability and health benefits, \namong others.  \n86.  They also may lose their homes and communities if the program is allowed to \nexpire. An internal White House memo reported on by CNN stated that DHS now is urging DACA \ngrantees “to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States” when their DACA \nterms end. See Ex. 88 (Tal Kopan & Jim Acosta, Admin Memo: DACA recipients should prepare \nfor departure from the United States, CNN, Sept. 5, 2017).  This threat of deportation is consistent \nwith past references to deportation of DACA grantees, such as a statement by Attorney General \nSessions in response to a question regarding the deportation of a DACA grantee that “[e]verybody \nin the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come here and they stay here a few \nyears and somehow they think they are not subject to being deported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t \npromise people who are here unlawfully that they aren’t going to be deported.”  See Ex. 49 (Adam \nShaw, Sessions defends immigration policies after reported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News, \nApr. 19, 2017).  \n87.  President Trump also has taken affirmative steps to reduce the privacy protections \napplicable to DACA grantee information. In January 2017, President Trump issued an Executive \nOrder directing all agencies, including DHS, to “ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons \nwho are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the \nPrivacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.” See Ex. 76 (Executive Order 13768, \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 22 of 79 PageID #: 1641\n“Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” Jan. 25, 2017). In response to the \nExecutive Order, DHS adopted a privacy policy that “permits the sharing of information about \nimmigrants and non-immigrants with federal, state, and local law enforcement.” See Ex. 51 (DHS, \nPrivacy Policy 2017-01 Questions & Answers, Apr. 27, 2017). \n88.  The DHS Memorandum provides no assurance to DACA grantees, or direction to \nUSCIS and ICE, that information contained in DACA applications cannot be used for the purpose \nof future immigration enforcement proceedings.  \n89.  To the contrary, on the same day that the DHS Memorandum was issued, DHS \nchanged its public guidance about the use of DACA application data for immigration enforcement. \nDHS removed the webpage containing the assurance that, absent exceptional circumstances, \nDACA  application  data  “is  protected  from  disclosure  to  ICE  and  CBP  for  the  purpose  of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings.” Cf. Ex. 25 (containing link to USCIS webpage that now \ncontains an error alert and a message stating, “The page you are looking for may not exist or is \ntemporarily unavailable.”). The same day, DHS posted a new policy governing the use of \ninformation provided by DACA applicants. DHS now states that USCIS “[g]enerally” will not \n“proactively provid[e] information obtained through DACA to ICE and CBP. See Ex. 89 (DHS, \nFrequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Sept. 5, 2017). \nThe new policy imposes no restrictions on USCIS providing DACA data at the request of ICE, \nCBP, or any other law enforcement entity. Id. DHS also reserves the right to change its new policy \n“at any time without notice” and states that the policy “may not be relied upon” by any party. Id. \n90.  DACA grantees thus immediately face the risk that information they provided to \nthe federal government could be used against them at any time, without notice, for purposes of \nimmigration enforcement, including detention or removal. \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 23 of 79 PageID #: 1642\nThe Defendants’ Failure to Notify Certain DACA Grantees of the October 5, 2017 Renewal \nDeadline.  \n \n91.  Before the termination of DACA, Defendants had a written policy and practice \nallowing DACA grantees to submit their renewal application up to one year after the date of \nexpiration of their participation in DACA. If DACA grantees failed to renew within one year of \nthe expiration date, they had the option to re-apply as initial applicants. See Ex. 14 (USCIS FAQs \n– Q50). \n92.  In addition, USCIS and DHS had a long-standing practice of using the address \ninformation they maintain for DACA grantees to send individualized notices to those grantees \nregarding their renewal expiration dates. See Ex. 178 (DACA Renewal Notice).  \n93.  On information and belief, no standard renewal notices have been provided to \nDACA grantees whose participation in DACA expires between February 6, 2018 and March 5, \n2018. Prior to termination of DACA, a DACA grantee whose renewal status expires in February \n2018 would have received an individualized renewal notice informing the grantee that he or she \nhad to file a renewal 120-150 days prior to expiration, i.e., by November 2017, in order to avoid a \nlapse  in  deferred  action  and  employment  authorization.  See,  e.g.,  id.  However,  since  the \ntermination, Defendants have not yet sent this group of DACA grantees any notices regarding \nwhen and how they can renew.  \n94.  On information and belief, the government sent standard renewal notices up until \nAugust 1, 2017 for DACA grantees whose participation in DACA expires by January 2018, \ninforming the grantees they had the standard 120-150 days prior to the expiration date to renew if \nthey wished to “avoid a lapse in [their] period of deferred action and employment authorization”. \nSee, e.g., id. However, in light of DHS’s decision to impose an absolute cut-off date of October 5, \n2017 for all renewal applications, the information conveyed in these notices is now incorrect.  The \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 24 of 79 PageID #: 1643\nnotices misleadingly suggest to DACA grantees that they have several additional months beyond \nOctober 5 to renew their DACA status without a gap in employment authorization. Moreover, the \nfaulty renewal notices were not followed with individualized corrected notices informing this \ngroup of grantees that there is a new, absolute October 5 deadline for renewal, and that DACA \ngrantees will no longer have up to one year after the date of expiration of their DACA to submit a \nrenewal application.  \n95.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to provide individualized notice regarding the \nnew October 5, 2017 renewal deadline to DACA grantees whose participation expires before \nMarch 5, 2018, individuals who received no notice or incorrect notice of the new deadline may be \nforever ineligible to renew their participation in DACA. These DACA grantees will no longer be \nprotected from deportation and will lose work authorization that they may have otherwise had. \nThey may also lose health insurance, social security cards, driver’s licenses and other benefits. \n96.  On October 3, 2017, DHS issued a press release stating that “[o]f the approximately \n154,200 individuals whose DACA is set to expire between Sept. 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018, just \nover 106,000 either have renewal requests currently pending with USCIS, or have already had \nUSCIS  adjudicate  their  renewal  request.”   See  Ex.  82  (DHS  Press  Release  Department  of \nHomeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke Reminds Eligible DACA Recipients to File \nRenewal Requests, October 3, 2017). Therefore, up to one third of DACA grantees who are eligible \nfor renewal had not applied as of two days before the October 5, 2017 deadline.   \nThe Government’s Failure to Notify DACA Grantees of their Inability to Renew Their \nDACA Status If It Expires After March 5, 2018.  \n97.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants’  termination  of  DACA  was  solely \ncommunicated to DACA grantees through the publication of DHS’s memorandum on September \n5, 2017 on the DHS website and by a concurrent television announcement from Attorney General \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 25 of 79 PageID #: 1644\nSessions. See Ex. 74 (DHS Memo); See Ex. 75 (Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on \nDACA). \n98.   On information and belief, the government did not and does not plan to issue \nindividualized notices to any DACA grantees informing them of the termination of DACA and \ntheir inability to renew if their DACA status expires after March 5, 2018.  \n99.  Many DACA grantees relied upon their ability to apply to renew DACA in making \nimportant decisions related to their employment, education and families, among other things. \nHARM TO PLAINTIFF STATES \n100.  The States will suffer harm as a result of the termination of the DACA program, \nincluding immediate and irreparable injuries to their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \ninterests. \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF NEW YORK \n101.

Obtaining DACA status has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of Oregon, to work legally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, access \nlines of credit, purchase homes and cars, have more ready access to in-state tuition, and obtain \nemployer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n162.  An estimated 10,347 Oregon DACA grantees are employed. See Ex. 5 ¶ 72 (Decl. \nWong).  An estimated 611 are business owners. Id. An estimated 5,083 are in school, and 3,634 \ncurrently are pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. Id. ¶ 73. \n163.  The State of Oregon’s revenue structure relies heavily on income taxes, including \ncapital gains for investors, wages paid to workers, and corporate taxes that are directly linked to \nprofitability. See Ex. 126 ¶ 9 (Decl. Read).   \n164.  Eliminating DACA grantee Oregonians’ ability to work legally will cause many to \nlose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in less tax revenue for the state and impairment of \nthe state’s economic health. See, e.g., Ex. 100 ¶ 6 (Decl. Nicolas). According to one estimate, \nDACA-eligible residents contribute approximately $20 million annually in state and local taxes in \nOregon—a contribution that may drop by $11 million without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, \nWiehe and Hill). Another estimate suggests that terminating DACA would, over a ten-year period, \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 38 of 79 PageID #: 1657\nimpact the Oregon economy with $384 million in budgetary costs and $1.3 billion in economic \ncosts. See Ex. 4, Table 1 (Decl. Brannon).   \n165.  In addition, the inability to work legally and enjoy the other benefits of legal status \nsuch as better access to credit and the banking system will make it more difficult, if not impossible, \nfor DACA grantee Oregonians to start businesses that contribute to the State’s economy and \noverall financial health. See Ex. 126 ¶ 12 (Decl. Read).  \n166.  In addition to the direct benefits to state programs of increased state revenues, the \nState is also an investor and a borrower. See Ex. 126 ¶¶ 5-9 (Decl. Read). The State’s credit rating, \ncost of borrowing, and the performance of the State’s investments are all tied to the overall \neconomic health of the State. See Ex. 126 ¶ 9 (Decl. Read). A reduced state tax base, and potential \ndownward pressure on corporate performance, has the potential to adversely affect these interests \nas well. Many of the companies in which Oregon and Oregonians have holdings have expressed \nconcern that the rescission of the DACA program is a threat and will be disruptive to their \nemployees, their productivity, and their competitiveness. Any such disruption or downward \npressure on corporate profits also potentially affects Oregon as a taxing entity and a shareholder.   \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 39 of 79 PageID #: 1658\nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA \n167.

The Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget (“RIOMB”) estimates that the \ntermination of DACA could lead to over $1 million in lost state and local income, real estate and \nvehicle taxes. See Ex. 128 ¶ 3 (Decl. Womer, RIOMB).  According to one estimate, DACA-eligible \nresidents contribute approximately $3.8 million annually in state and local taxes in Rhode Island—\na contribution that may drop by $1.2 million without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe \nand Hill).  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (“ITEP”), the State of \nRhode Island alone will lose $2.6 million in state and local taxes if DACA protections are lost. See \nEx. 54.

The States have an interest in prohibiting the deprivation of life, liberty or property \nwithout due process, and in preventing any practice that denies equal protection of the laws or \notherwise discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin. For example: \na.  New York’s Constitution guarantees all persons the right to equal treatment under \nthe law and forbids discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion. N.Y. \nConst. art. I, § 11. And New York’s statutes reiterate the State’s strong interest in \ncombatting discrimination and prejudice. See N.Y. Exec. Law § 290. \nb.  Washington  has  declared  that  practices  that  discriminate  against  any  of  its \ninhabitants because of race, color, or national origin are matters of public concern \nthat threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public \nwelfare, health, and peace of the people. See Wash. Rev. Code 49.60.010. \nc.  Colorado welcomes people of all backgrounds. Colorado law prohibits unlawful \ndiscrimination against people based on, among other things, race, national origin, \nand ancestry. See C.R.S. § 24-34-601; C.R.S. § 24-34-402; C.R.S. § 24-34-502.  \nd.  The Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1 et seq., establishes a public policy \n“to secure for all individuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination against \nany individual because of his or her … national origin.” See 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A). \nIt further establishes a public policy “to prevent discrimination based on citizenship \nstatus in employment.” See 775 ILCS 5/1-102(C).   \ne.  The Council of the District of Columbia enacted the District’s Human Rights Act \n“to secure an end in the District of Columbia to discrimination for any reason other \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 44 of 79 PageID #: 1663\nthan that of individual merit,” including discrimination based on national origin. \nSee D.C. Code Ann. § 2-1401.01. The District’s Human Rights Act prohibits \ndiscrimination in a broad range of areas including employment, education, places \nof  public  accommodation,  public  services,  housing  and  commercial  space \naccommodations, the sale of motor vehicle insurance and the rental of motor \nvehicles.  \nf.  Through a long tradition of including and incorporating foreign-born persons into \nits institutions, businesses, and governments, New Mexico has become one of the \nmost socially and politically diverse states. New Mexico enshrined in its state \nconstitution three provisions protecting the Spanish language and those who speak \nit.  See N.M. Const. art. VII, § 3 (stating that “[t]he right of any citizen of the state \nto vote, hold office or sit upon juries shall never be restricted, abridged or impaired \non account of .  .  . language . . . or inability to speak, read or write the English or \nSpanish languages except as otherwise provided in this constitution”); N.M. Const. \nart. XII, § 8 (requiring teachers to become proficient in English and Spanish); and \nN.M. Const. art. XII. § 10 (guaranteeing that “[c]hildren of Spanish descent in the \nstate of New Mexico shall never be denied the right and privilege of admission and \nattendance in the public schools or other public educational institutions of the state, \nand they shall never be classed in separate schools, but shall forever enjoy perfect \nequality with other children in all public schools and educational institutions of the \nstate”). \ng.  Oregon has codified its state policy that practices of unlawful discrimination against \nany of its inhabitants because of religion or national origin are “a matter of state \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 45 of 79 PageID #: 1664\nconcern,” and that such discrimination “menaces the institutions and foundation of \na free democratic state.” See ORS § 659A.006. \nh.  Pennsylvania’s laws reflect its commitment to values of diversity, multiculturalism \nand  openness  to  others  of  different  races  and  nationalities.  For  example, \nPennsylvania’s Human Relations Act recognizes that an individual’s opportunity \nto  obtain  employment,  public  accommodation,  housing  accommodation  and \ncommercial property without discrimination on the basis of “race, color, familial \nstatus … ancestry [and] national origin” is a “civil right” that is “enforceable” under \nPennsylvania law. See 43 P.S. § 953. See also 43 P.S. § 955. \ni.  In keeping with its history of freedom of conscience, equality and tolerance, Rhode \nIsland has prohibited practices that discriminate against any of its inhabitants \nbecause of race, color, or national origin. See R.I. Constitution Article 1, section 2; \nR.I. Gen. Laws 12-19-38 (Hate Crimes Sentencing Act); R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-\n1 (The Civil Rights Act of 1990); R.I. Gen. Laws 28-5-1 (Fair Employment \nPractices Act); R.I. Gen. Laws 34-37-1 (Fair Housing Practices Act).   \n188.  The States also have an interest in ensuring that their residents are not excluded \nfrom the benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and \nprivileges provided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 46 of 79 PageID #: 1665\nHarm to States as Employers. \n189.  The States have an interest in maintaining qualified, trained workforces. \n190.  Terminating DACA will cause the States to lose qualified State employees. Many \nDACA recipients work in government or at state-run institutions, and they were hired because of \ntheir specialized skills and qualifications. The States expended time and funds to hire, train, and \nmanage DACA recipients. If these individuals become ineligible to work, the States will lose the \nvalue of their investment and the services of employees who perform important functions for the \nStates.  They  will  also  incur  the  costs  associated  with  the  need  to  recruit,  hire,  and  train \nreplacements. See, e.g., Ex. 52 ¶ 8 (Decl.

The States have an interest in the special contributions that DACA grantees make \nto State colleges and universities as students, employees, and alumni.  \n192.

DACA  has  made  it  possible  for  many  young  people  to  attend  colleges  and \nuniversities in the States, as work authorization allows DACA grantees to work both while they \npursue their education and after graduation. More than 90% of DACA grantees report that DACA \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 48 of 79 PageID #: 1667\nallowed them to pursue educational opportunities previously unavailable to them. See Ex. 5 ¶ 18 \n(Decl. Wong).  For example: \na.  The University of Colorado estimates that there are over 200 DACA grantees \nenrolled across the University. Ex. 132 ¶ 5 (Decl. Allen). Colorado State University \nhas approximately 189 DACA grantees. Ex. 131 ¶ 8 (Decl. Miranda).   \nb.  Delaware Technical and Community College (“DTCC”) has at least 148 DACA \nstudents and at least another 242 graduates who are DACA grantees. See Ex. 135 ¶ \n5 (Decl. Rakes). Many of DTCC’s DACA students are nontraditional learners who \nsupport their families in addition to pursuing their education. Id. ¶ 8. Another \napproximate  75  DACA  grantees  currently  attend  Delaware  State  University \n(“DSU”). See Ex. 66 (Scott Gross, DSU immigrant students fear Trump’s DACA \ndecision, Delawareonline, Sept. 2, 2017). \nc.  Presently, there are 16 students who have reported their DACA status to the \nUniversity of Hawaii and who are pursuing various degrees at multiple University \ncampuses. Ex. 137 ¶ 6 (Decl. Straney). \nd.  In the University of Illinois System, approximately 350 of its students and 100 of \nits employees would be affected by the termination of DACA. Ex. 143 ¶ 8 (Decl. \nWilson, Univ. of Illinois System). \ne.  In New York, both the State University of New York (“SUNY”) and the City \nUniversity of New York (“CUNY”) have encouraged DACA grantees to apply as \npart of their strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. See Ex. 12 ¶ 10 \n(Decl. Milliken, CUNY); Ex. 99 (Decl. Johnson, SUNY). At CUNY, hundreds of \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 49 of 79 PageID #: 1668\nDACA grantees have enrolled in the university, many with the benefit of full \nscholarships. See Ex. 12 ¶ 6 (Decl. Milliken); Ex. 171 ¶8 (Decl. Park). \nf.  Many  of  Oregon’s  public  colleges  and  universities,  including  Portland  State \nUniversity, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, Oregon Health and \nScience  University,  Eastern  Oregon  University,  Western  Oregon  University, \nSouthern Oregon University and Portland Community College enroll, and in some \ncases employ, DACA grantees. See Ex. 157 ¶ 4 (Decl. Ridder); Ex. 159 ¶ 5 (Decl. \nGalvan); Ex. 155 ¶ 5 (Decl. Alexander); Ex. 154 ¶ 5 (Decl. Cuprill-Comas); Ex. \n153 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Karpilo); Ex. 160 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl.

Many institutions of higher education in Virginia have students presently enrolled \nin their educational programs who are DACA grantees. According to the State \nCouncil  of  Higher  Education  for  Virginia  (“SCHEV”),  the  Commonwealth's \ncoordinating body for higher education, there are more than 1,300 DACA students \nin Virginia attending institutions of higher education. See Ex. 127 ¶¶ 4 (Decl. Blake, \nSCHEV).  \nh.  According to the Washington Student Achievement Council (“WSAC”), the state \nagency that advances educational opportunities in Washington, there are more than \n1,400 DACA students in Washington attending institutions of higher education. See \nEx. 59 ¶ 9 (Decl. Thompson, WSAC). More than one hundred DACA grantees \nattend the University of Washington, based in Seattle. See Ex. 57 ¶ 4 (Decl. \n49 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 50 of 79 PageID #: 1669\nBallinger, Univ. of Wash.). More than 150 DACA grantees attend Washington \nState University, based in Pullman. See Ex. 58 ¶ 4 (Decl. Loera, Wash. State Univ.).  \ni.  Many  public  colleges  and  universities  in  the  States  have  diverse  student \npopulations, including a high percentage of Latino/Hispanic students and students \nwho are first generation Americans and first in their families to attend college, as \nwell as undocumented students. See, e.g., Ex. 162 (Letter from Meghan Hughes, \nCommunity College of Rhode Island); Ex. 150 ¶ 7 (Decl. Abdallah, University of \nNew Mexico). Although many such schools do not keep data on immigration status, \nthey know that they have DACA grantees as alumni and current students.  See Ex. \n163 (Letter from Frank Sánchez, Rhode Island College President); Ex. 164 ¶ 6 \n(Decl. Farish, Roger Williams University); Ex. 161 (Letter from Richard M.

Without the DACA program, talented young immigrants will be less likely to apply \nto and attend State schools because they will not be able to afford tuition given the loss of available \nfinancial assistance (in some of the States) and the likelihood that they will not be able to work \nlegally upon graduation (in all the States). Those already enrolled will be less likely to finish their \neducation at State schools due to the loss of current and future earning potential. See Ex. 12 ¶ 7-8 \n(Decl. Milliken); Ex. 56 ¶ 7 (Decl.

Additionally,  DACA  students  enrolled  in  programs  that  require  employment \nauthorization or entail licensing requirements to complete elements of the program—such as paid \ninternships, clinical placement, residency training, or programs that require significant lab or field \nwork—will be severely and adversely impacted if DACA is terminated. Indeed, these students \nmay not be able to complete the academic requirements of their degrees. See, e.g., Ex. 12 ¶ 8 (Decl. \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 52 of 79 PageID #: 1671\nMilliken); Ex. 61 ¶ 6 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 135 ¶ 9 (Decl.

Mathewson & Pareja); Ex. 145 ¶ 9 (Decl. Kennedy); Ex 6 \n¶¶ 13-15 (Decl. C. Andrade).  \n197.  DACA students in graduate programs at public universities in the States will be \nsignificantly  affected  because  the  loss  of  employment  authorization  needed  for  graduate \nassistantship (research or teaching) will likely mean the loss of tuition waivers and other benefits \nsuch as subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance for the students and their families. The loss \nof graduate assistants also is a significant harm to the States because of the services they provide \nin assisting faculty and instructing students. See Ex. 61 ¶ 5 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 31-32 \n(Decl. Herbst). \n198.  Losing these talented young immigrants will deprive the States’ schools of the \nspecial and unique contributions and perspectives they bring to campus communities, both as \nstudents and alumni. See, e.g., Ex. 57 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. Ballinger); Ex. 58 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Loera); Ex. 61 \n¶ 7 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 132 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Allen);  Ex. 131 ¶ 9 (Decl. Miranda); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 19-\n26, 36-38 (Decl.

The States’ public universities and colleges will also suffer direct financial harm, \nincluding lost tuition revenue and scholarship funds, if DACA students are forced to withdraw or \nare unable to enroll. See, e.g., Ex. 57 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. Ballinger); Ex. 58 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Loera,); Ex. 61 \n¶ 7 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 27-28 (Decl. Herbst); Ex. 133 ¶¶ 17-18 (Decl. Pachis); Ex. 136 \n¶ 8 (Decl.

Allen); Ex. 131 ¶ 9 (Decl. \nMiranda); Ex. 145 ¶¶ 10-14 (Decl. Kennedy). In at least one state (Oregon), current demographic \nand enrollment trends and other factors suggest that this lost revenue will not be replaced by other \nstudents for many universities, and will represent an absolute loss of revenue. See Ex. 160 ¶ 8 \n(Decl. Hagemann); Ex. 158 ¶ 7 (Decl. Trueblood-Gamble); Ex. 157 ¶ 7 (Decl. Ridder). \n200.  Terminating  DACA  also  will  impose  additional  tangible  costs  on  our  public \ncolleges and universities, which already have begun to experience disruption as a result of \nuncertainty over the future of the program and are preparing for the likelihood of expending \nadditional resources to address the detrimental effects of DACA termination. See, e.g., Ex. 61 ¶¶ \n8-9 (Decl. Heatwole); Ex. 134 ¶¶ 35, 38 (Decl. Herbst); Ex. 136 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Hardwick); Ex. 157 \n¶ 12 (Decl. Ridder); Ex. 155 ¶ 7 (Decl. Alexander); Ex. 153 ¶ 11 (Decl. Karpilo); Ex. 160 ¶ 9 \n(Decl. Hagemann); Ex. 158 ¶¶ 10, 12 (Decl. Trueblood-Gamble); Ex. 132 ¶ 9 (Decl. Allen); Ex. \n167 ¶ 6 (Decl. Reveley).   \n201.  Terminating DACA will further deprive the States of the earning potential of \ngraduates from public colleges and universities who are most likely to stay in-State and join the \nStates’ workforces.  See, e.g., Ex. 132 ¶ 9 (Decl. Allen).  For example: \n53 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 54 of 79 PageID #: 1673\na.  Nine out of ten Massachusetts public higher education graduates remain in the \nState, working or pursuing further education.  See Ex. 93 (Mass. Dept. of Higher \nEducation, Time to Lead, The Need for Excellence in Public Higher Education, \nSept. 2012).   \nb.  The majority of Iowa public higher education graduates remain in Iowa, working \nor pursuing further education.  See Ex. 67 at 26 (The University of Iowa Pomerantz \nCareer Center, 2015-2016 Annual Report); Ex. 68 (Iowa State University 6-Month \nPost Graduation Status, 2014-2015; Ex. 73 at 2 (Career Ready, University of \nNorthern Iowa Career Services, 2016).  \nc.  Nearly 90% of Community College of Rhode Island graduates stay in Rhode Island \nafter graduation to live and raise their families. Ex. 162 (Hughes Letter). \nd.  Approximately 85 to 87 percent of Eastern Connecticut State University graduates \nstay in Connecticut after graduation to “contribute[] to the growth and vitality of \nConnecticut’s economy.” Ex. 133 ¶ 16 (Decl. Pachis). \n202.  Terminating DACA will also undermine the investment in and efforts to develop a \nwell-educated workforce that can contribute to the States’ overall economies and competitiveness, \nand the States’ ability to meet certain critical workforce needs such as healthcare in rural areas. \nSee, e.g., Ex. 159 ¶ 6 (Decl. Galvan); Ex. 154 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Decl. Cuprill-Comas); Ex. 156 ¶ 11 (Decl. \nMitsui). Currently, 100 DACA grantees are medical students and medical resident physicians at \nschools that are members of the Association of American Medical Colleges, and approximately \ntwo-thirds of these DACA grantees are pursuing their medical education in one of the States. See \nEx. 114 ¶ 4 (Decl. Prescott, Association of American Medical Colleges).  Aspiring DACA-grantee \nphysicians contribute to a diverse and culturally responsive workforce to meet the needs of \n54 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 55 of 79 PageID #: 1674\nunderserved populations. See id. ¶¶ 5-6. Terminating DACA will cause the States to lose specific \ninvestments that they have made in this workforce and will leave significant gaps in the States’ \nhealthcare workforce. See id. ¶ 7; Ex. 85 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Swenson).  For example: \na.  In Illinois, DACA grantees have participated in a loan program, through the Illinois \nFinance Authority, in which students receive interest-free loans so long as they \nagree to repay the principal and commit to four years of work in an underserved \nIllinois community following their graduation. Ex. 141 ¶ 6 (Decl. Pelissero & \nCallahan,  Loyola  Univ.  of  Chicago).  Without  DACA,  underserved  Illinois \ncommunities will lose access to these committed medical professionals.  Id. ¶ 8. \nb.  Oregon’s legislature has established a program to provide scholarships to health \nprofessional students who commit to practicing in rural and underserved areas of \nthe state for a period of time following graduation. See ORS 348.303. At least one \ndental student participant in this program is a DACA recipient who will likely not \nbe able to complete his commitment to practice dentistry in an underserved area of \nOregon.  See Ex. 94 ¶¶ 4, 9-18 (Decl. Ramirez Cuevas). \n203.  The nation’s leading private universities will suffer harms if DACA is terminated.  \nHarvard University, for example, has more than 50 DACA students currently enrolled.  See Ex. 96 \n¶ 6 (Decl. Madsen, Harvard Univ.).  Tufts University has more than 25 DACA students.  See Ex. \n97 ¶ 8 (Decl. Jeka, Tufts Univ.). Brown University has approximately 12 DACA students.  See Ex. \n161 (Locke Letter). Roger Williams University, home to Rhode Island’s only law school, has at \nleast six DACA students. See Ex. 164 ¶ 6 (Decl. Farish). These students often have had to \novercome significant challenges in order to gain acceptance and bring critical perspectives, \ninsights, and experiences to their universities. They make important and lasting contributions, \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 56 of 79 PageID #: 1675\nincluding through their  classroom participation, their extracurricular engagements, and their \ncommitment to independent study and research. See, e.g., Ex. 97 ¶ 5 (Decl. Jeka); Ex. 96 ¶¶ 5, 7, \n12 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. 144 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Martin, Amherst College); Ex. 147 ¶ 7 (Decl. Stephens, \nMount Holyoke College); Ex. 140 ¶¶ 4, 6, 9 (Decl. Jensen, Illinois Wesleyan Univ.); Ex. 141 ¶¶ \n4, 5, 6, 7,8 (Decl. Pelissero & Callahan); Ex. 138 ¶¶ 6, 11 (Decl. Salgado, City Colleges of \nChicago); Ex. 164 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Farish); Ex. 161 (Locke Letter). \n204.  Employment authorization gives these students and their universities an assurance \nthat they may put their talents to use in the United States job market after graduation, benefitting \nthe States and the nation as a whole.  See, e.g., Ex. 96 ¶¶ 12-15 (Decl. Madsen); Ex. 161 (Locke \nLetter); Ex. 144 ¶ 9 (Decl. Martin, Amherst); Ex. 147 ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Stephens). \n205.  DACA has allowed these students to step outside the shadow of their immigration \nstatus and to participate fully as members of academic and campus communities in ways that likely \nwould not be possible otherwise.  See, e.g., Ex. 140 ¶¶ 7, 8 (Decl. Jensen); Ex. 97 ¶ 7 (Decl. Jeka); \nEx. 96 ¶ 12 (Decl. Madsen); Ex.  ¶ 7 (Decl. Martin, Amherst).  Terminating  DACA will take \nimportant opportunities away from DACA students and reintroduce fear and uncertainty into their \nlives,  with  significant  adverse  effects  on  these  students,  their  universities,  and  the  broader \ncommunity.  See Ex. 140 ¶¶ 7, 8 (Decl. Jensen); Ex. 97 ¶¶ 8-10 (Decl. Jeka); Ex. 96 ¶ 13 (Decl. \nMadsen); Ex. 144 ¶ 10 (Decl. Martin, Amherst); Ex. 148 ¶ 6 (Decl.

The  States  have  an  interest  in  preserving  their  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy \nframeworks that take the DACA program into account. \n207.  Many of the States have enacted laws, promulgated regulations, and/or established \npolicies that contemplate and rely on the DACA program.  If DACA is terminated, these legal, \nregulatory, and policy regimes will be harmed.  For example: \na.  Since 2012, Connecticut has granted driver’s licenses to approximately 5,000 \nDACA grantees who are Connecticut residents, many of whom have also purchased \nand registered vehicles in Connecticut. See Ex. 121 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Bzdyra).  DACA \ngrantees who have purchased and registered vehicles will have paid Connecticut \nsales tax and local property taxes for such vehicles.  Id. ¶¶ 8-9.      \nb.  Illinois has enacted laws to enable DACA grantees to participate in the economy \nprofessionally. These include providing that no person in Illinois shall be prohibited \nfrom receiving a law license solely because he or she is not a citizen and explicitly \nallowing DACA grantees to apply for a license to practice law. See 705 Ill. Comp. \nStat. 205/2. DACA grantees are also eligible to receive state-issued identification \ncards and drivers’ licenses; own motor vehicles which are registered, titled and \nlicensed in the state of Illinois; and own businesses and property in Illinois. See Ex. \n125 ¶ 6 (Decl. White, Illinois Secretary of State). The Office of the Illinois \nSecretary of State will be adversely impacted if DACA is terminated by the loss of \nrevenue from licensing fees and taxes, as well as costs and system disruptions \nrelated to eligibility determinations of license renewals for DACA recipients. Id. ¶ \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 58 of 79 PageID #: 1677\n7. Illinois administrative rules, regulations and laws will also need to be amended \nto conform to the changes in the DACA program. Id. \nc.  Under DACA, thousands of young Massachusetts and Oregon residents are able to \nreceive social security cards and thereby have access to driver’s licenses, which \nthey depend on to attend heath care appointments, to commute to work and school, \nand to attend to other necessities for themselves and their family members.  See Ex. \n9 (Mass. Registry of Motor Vehicles, Social Security Number (SSN) Requirements); \nORS 807.021 (proof of legal presence required to issue, renew or replace driver \nlicense); Ex. 175  (Attorney General Advisory Letter to Acting Commissioner J. \nEric Boyette, Jan.17, 2013); Ex. 101 ¶ 3 (Decl. Preciado); Ex. 71 ¶¶ 5-7, 9 (Decl. \nI.T.); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 70 ¶¶ 5, 8 (Decl. I.V.).  Terminating  \nDACA will make it impossible for these individuals to apply for new licenses or \nrenew the licenses they have, leading to a number of adverse outcomes, including \na decrease in licensing fees paid to the States, a decrease in productivity of these \nresidents, and an increase in unlicensed drivers on the road.   \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 59 of 79 PageID #: 1678\nHarm to Public Health and Health Care Costs. \n208.  The States have an interest in protecting the public health and in minimizing health \ncare costs expended by the States.  \n209.  Terminating DACA will harm public health and impose additional health care costs \non the States. Work authorization allows DACA grantees to access employer-sponsored health \nbenefits. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 4 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 171 ¶18 (Decl. \nPark); Ex. 172 ¶8 (Decl. Morales); Ex. 110 ¶ 8 (Decl. Schlosberg, District of Columbia Department \nof Health Care Finance).  In fact, more than 50% of DACA grantees have obtained employer-\nprovided insurance. See Ex. 5 ¶ 12 (Decl. Wong). Without these benefits, more of the States’ \nresidents are likely to forgo needed health care, including preventive care, which will create more \ncostly health problems in the long run. It also will cause more people to rely on state-funded and/or \nstate-administered public health care and other benefits and thus impose additional costs on the \nStates. For example: \na.  Colorado provides emergency Medicaid regardless of immigration status, which \ncovers the hospital delivery of children for qualified undocumented immigrants. \nSee Ex. 78 at 1-2 (Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing letter \ndated June 28, 2005). \nb.  Delaware provides limited emergency and labor/delivery services to residents \nwhose immigration status otherwise keeps them from accessing health care benefits \nand services.  See Ex. 122 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Groff).  \nc.  The  D.C.  HealthCare  Alliance  is  the  District  of  Columbia’s  state-sponsored \ninsurance program of last resort. See Ex. 110 ¶¶ 6, 9 (Decl. Schlosberg); see also \nD.C. Code § 7-771.07(2).  The placement of all of the individuals in the District \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 60 of 79 PageID #: 1679\nparticipating in the DACA program in 2017 onto the D.C. HealthCare Alliance \nwould require the District to spend additional money on that program, harm District \nfinances, and prevent the District from spending that money on other public health \npriorities. See Ex. 110 ¶ 10 (Decl. Schlosberg). In fact, the placement of these \nindividuals onto the D.C. HealthCare Alliance could cost the District an additional \n$283,000 per month in District of Columbia Fiscal Year 2018.  See id. ¶ 12. \nd.  Under  Hawaii’s  Prepaid  Health  Care  Act,  Haw.  Rev.  Stat.  ch.  393,  Hawaii \nemployers are required to provide regular employees who meet wage requirements \nwith coverage under a qualifying prepaid group health care plan. See Haw. Rev. \nStat. § 393-11. The termination of DACA will likely cause more people to rely on \nHawaii’s  state-administered  Medicaid  One-Time  Emergency  services.  Hawaii \nreimburses hospitals for emergency and urgent services provided to qualifying \nuninsured Hawaii patients, including undocumented immigrants. Ex. 123 ¶¶ 5-6 \n(Decl. Peterson, Med-QUEST Division, Hawaii Department of Human Services).   \ne.  In Massachusetts, DACA grantees who lose employer-based coverage may be \neligible for MassHealth, a state-funded health insurance program. See Ex. 83 ¶¶ 5-\n7 (Decl. Caplan, Mass. Executive Office of Health and Human Services).  In \naddition, Massachusetts will very likely have to cover some, if not all, of the costs \nof health care visits for these individuals through its state-administered Health \nSafety Net program or other programs. Id. ¶¶ 8-9. Finally, some DACA grantees \nwho lose employer-based coverage will likely use providers, like community based \nhealth centers, that are funded in part by grants and other funding streams available \nthrough the state. Id. ¶¶ 10-14.  \n60 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 61 of 79 PageID #: 1680\n210.  New York State currently funds Medicaid coverage for low-income undocumented \nimmigrants who have received deferred action, including DACA-eligible immigrants. See Ex. 77 \n(Office of Health Insurance Program, Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act \n(CHIPRA)  Expanded  Coverage  for  Certain  Qualified  and  PRUCOL  Aliens,  May  7,  2013). \nTerminating DACA may reduce access to Medicaid for current DACA grantees. New York State \ncurrently  funds  Medicaid  coverage  for  low-income  undocumented  immigrants who have \nreceived deferred action, including DACA-eligible immigrants. See Id. Individuals in New York \nwho are not DACA grantees may only qualify for Medicaid coverage of care and services \nnecessary to treat an emergency condition. Terminating DACA will require New York to either \nseek a State legislative change to maintain current Medicaid coverage formerly  DACA-eligible \nimmigrants with state dollars only or limit Medicaid coverage to treatment of emergency conditions \nfor some or all of these individuals. \nHarm to Small Cities, Counties, and Towns. \n211.  The States have an interest in preventing economic and other harm to their small \ncities, towns, counties, and other small governmental jurisdictions. \n212.  Terminating DACA will harm small governmental jurisdictions in the States. If \nDACA is terminated, small governmental jurisdictions will lose talented and trained employees, \nadversely affecting operations and costing time, money, and effort to replace and retrain these \nemployees. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶¶ 10-11 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque, City of Chelsea, MA and \nChelsea Public Schools); Ex. 113 ¶¶ 4-6 (Decl. Schuh). Many of these employees are highly skilled \nworkers, including in critical fields such as nursing. See, e.g., Ex. 135 ¶¶ 10, 13 (Decl. Rakes); Ex. \n98 ¶ 7, 10-11 (Naveed). \n61 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 62 of 79 PageID #: 1681\n213.  Terminating DACA will have a direct, adverse effect on economies and sales tax \nrevenues of small cities and towns, as DACA grantees will lose their jobs and refrain from buying \ngoods and services from local vendors. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶ 16 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. \n176 ¶¶ 8-10, 13 (Decl. Kennedy, City of Newburgh).  \n214.  DACA grantees average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers \nand are able to better participate in the States’ economies, for example by purchasing homes and \ncars that are taxed by our state and local authorities. See Ex. 5 ¶ 16 (Decl. Wong). If DACA is \nterminated, cities and towns will lose other local tax revenue, including real estate taxes and motor \nvehicle excise taxes, from DACA grantees who can no longer access lines of credit or afford to \nbuy cars or homes.  \n215.  If DACA is terminated, small governmental jurisdictions will lose the benefits that \nfull access by and participation of a diverse community fosters through community activities, \nincluding, for example, activities in libraries and local government-sponsored recreational camps \nor sports leagues. See, e.g, Ex. 109 ¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Meyer, New Castle County, Del.).  The \ntermination of DACA will also have a destructive effect on local industries of small governmental \njurisdictions that rely on the work of highly qualified and trained DACA recipients.     Ex. 176 ¶¶ \n4, 8-10, 13 (Decl. Kennedy, City of Newburgh).   \n216.  Terminating DACA will also adversely affect public safety, health, and wellbeing \nin  the  States’  cities,  towns,  and  schools.  Without  DACA  status,  DACA  grantees  afraid  of \ndeportation will be less likely to report violence, abuse, crimes or other harms to the community. \nIf DACA is terminated, 53% of current DACA grantees may be less likely to report a crime they \nwitnessed; 47% may be less likely to report a crime even if they were the victim; 48% may be less \nlikely to go to the hospital if they suffered an injury, and 60% may be less likely to report wage \n62 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 63 of 79 PageID #: 1682\ntheft by their employer. See Ex. 5 ¶ 24 (Decl. Wong). This will make it harder for local police and \nother officials to provide for the public safety and welfare. See, e.g., Ex. 111 ¶ 15 (Decl. Ambrosino \n& Bourque); Ex. 108 ¶¶ 7-10 (Decl. Hughes); Ex. 109 ¶ 6 (Decl. Meyer); Ex. 116 ¶¶ 10-13 (Decl. \nGraham,  Delaware  Community  Legal  Aid  Society,  Inc.).  For  example,  since  the  Trump \nAdministration announced plans to end DACA, Delaware law enforcement and legal aid have \nrecognized an increased reluctance among Delaware immigrants to engage with aspects of the \ncriminal justice system—even when that interaction would have been to protect their own victim \nrights. See, e.g., Ex. 108 ¶¶ 7-10 (Decl. Hughes); Ex. 116 ¶¶ 10-13 (Decl. Graham). \nHarm to School Districts, Including Small School Districts. \n217.  The States have an interest in effectively educating elementary and secondary \nstudents and in preventing economic harm to small and large school districts.  \n218.  If DACA is terminated, public school districts will suffer financial harm as well as \nharm to their educational missions. \n219.  The  termination  of  DACA  will  cause  school  districts  to  lose  talented  and \nexperienced teachers and other staff members who are DACA grantees, adversely affecting student \neducation and costing time, money, and effort to replace and retrain these employees.  See Ex. 111 \n¶ 11 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 79 (Whaley, Denver Public Schools say ending DACA \nwould have “catastrophic” effect, Denver Post, Aug. 31, 2017).  \n220.  In Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York, \nTeach for America has placed teachers who are DACA grantees in shortage-area subjects and hard-\nto-staff schools in low-income communities. See Ex. 11 ¶¶ 3, 11 (Decl. Carrizales, Teach For \nAmerica). Terminating DACA will not only deprive schools of their employees, but also deprive \nstudents of teachers whose live experiences may mirror their own lives. Id. ¶¶ 10, 11. \n63 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 64 of 79 PageID #: 1683\n221.  Public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  have  a  constitutional  obligation  to \neducate students irrespective of immigration status. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). The \ntermination of DACA will harm the States’ ability to educate DACA-eligible students as required \nby federal law. See Ex. 111 ¶¶ 12,14 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 112 ¶ 3-4 (Decl. \nKanninen, Arlington, VA Public Schools).  \n222.  If DACA-eligible students are no longer able to work legally after high school or \ncannot afford to go to college, these students will be less motivated to achieve in school. See Ex. \n111 ¶ 12 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque); Ex. 112 ¶ 3 (Decl. Kanninen). This will result in lower \nscores and higher dropout rates for these students. See Ex. 111 ¶ 12 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque).  \n223.  Poorer performance will impact school districts’ accountability ratings and could \nrequire removal of administrators and teachers as well as increased state funding to flow to these \nschool districts. See, e.g., Ex. 179 (Mass. Dep’t of Early and Secondary Educ., School Leader’s \nGuide to the 2017 Accountability Determinations, Sept. 2017). Decreased school performance will \nalso negatively impact the community, with families not wanting to buy homes in a lower-\nperforming district. See Ex. 111 ¶ 13 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque).  \n224.  Finally, DACA-eligible students will experience higher levels of anxiety about \ntheir futures and their families’ futures, and will require additional counseling and support from \nguidance counselors and other school personnel, costing school districts time and money. See Ex. \n111 ¶ 14 (Decl. Ambrosino & Bourque). \n64 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 65 of 79 PageID #: 1684\nHarm to Businesses and Nonprofits. \n225.  The States have an interest in their tax revenues, economies, and the financial well-\nbeing of their businesses and nonprofits. \n226.  Immigration is an important economic driver in the States.  Many of the States’ \nworkers are immigrants, and many of those immigrant workers are DACA grantees. See, e.g., Ex. \n5  ¶ ¶  28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88 (Decl. Wong); Ex. 126 ¶ 11 \n(Decl. Read, Oregon State Treasurer); Ex. 95 ¶ 7 (Decl. Solano); Ex. 101 ¶ 4 (Decl. Preciado); Ex. \n100 ¶ 6 (Decl. Nicolas); Ex. 124 ¶¶ 4, 10-11 (Decl. Salaveria); Ex. 168 ¶ 3 (Decl. Cabrera); Ex. \n120 ¶ 4 (Decl. Romero, Barrera Legal Group, PLLC); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 4,6,8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership \nfor NYC); Ex. 81 ¶¶ 2-3, 5-6 (Decl. Pinsky, ABNY).  Many companies in the States are dependent \non DACA grantees to operate and grow their businesses. The market for highly skilled workers \nand employees is extremely competitive.  Terminating DACA grantees’ work authorization will \ninhibit  the  States’  companies’  ability  to  adequately  staff  their  organizations,  develop  their \nworkforces, recruit talent, and maintain trained employees. The Center for American Progress \nestimates that it costs businesses roughly one-fifth of a worker’s salary to replace a worker due to \nproductivity loss, the cost of hiring and training a new employee, and ramp-up periods for new \nemployees. See Ex. 80 (Heather Boushey and Sarah Jane Glynn, There Are Significant Business \nCosts to Replacing Employees, Center for American Progress, November 16, 2012). \n65 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 66 of 79 PageID #: 1685\n227.  If companies lose employees and recruiting efforts are less successful, their ability \nto develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. See e.g., Ex. \n63 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Blackwell-Hawkins, Amazon); Ex. 90 ¶¶ 7-12, 14 (Decl. Shively, Microsoft); Ex. \n8 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mutty, Starbucks); Ex. 84 ¶¶ 4-11 (Decl. Kalvert, TripAdvisor); Ex. 119 ¶¶ 5-6 \n(Decl. Tingen, Tingen & Williams, PLLC); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 5-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for NYC). \nFor example: \na.  Colorado’s talented workforce has attracted major industries to the State, including \naerospace, high-tech, start-ups, and STEM-based employers. Many companies in \nColorado rely heavily on immigrants to operate their business. Terminating DACA \nwill disrupt these companies with DACA employees that are forced to terminate \nqualified and talented employees.  \nb.  In  Hawaii,  businesses  rely  heavily  on  immigrants  who  bring  their  talent, \nknowledge, and expertise to Hawaii’s labor force. See Ex. 124 ¶ 4 (Decl. Salaveria). \nBecause of Hawaii’s low unemployment rate, the state’s businesses have had \ndifficulty  filling their vacant positions. Id. ¶ 8. The departure of the  DACA \npopulation from Hawaii’s workforce will cause even greater difficulty for Hawaii \nemployers, and have a negative impact on Hawaii’s economy.  Id. ¶ 11.Agriculture \nand  forestry  are  two  of  Virginia’s  largest  private  industries.  The  Virginia \nDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services estimates that approximately \n1,944 of Virginia’s DACA grantees employed in primary agricultural production. \nSee Ex. 129 ¶ 3 (Decl. Gooden, Virginia Sec’y of Agriculture and Forestry). \nFurther, a percentage of DACA recipients are also likely to be regulated pesticide \napplicators. The loss of DACA status for these individuals would harm agricultural \n66 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 67 of 79 PageID #: 1686\nproduction and reduce income to Virginia from pesticide applicator licensing fees. \nSee id. ¶ 7. \nc.  In  Washington,  DACA  grantees  work  for  the  largest  companies  as  software \nengineers, finance professionals, and retail and sales associates, including for \nAmazon, Microsoft and Starbucks. See Ex. 63 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Blackwell-Hawkins, \nAmazon); Ex. 90 ¶¶ 7-12, 14 (Decl. Shively, Microsoft); Ex. 8 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mutty, \nStarbucks).  \nd.  In New York, businesses depend on the work of DACA grantees. See Ex. 170 ¶¶ 3, \n7-8, 10 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶ 7 (Decl. Greenberg, Warby Parker); \nEx. 172 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Morales); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for NYC). \nDACA recipients are the consumer base for many New York businesses. Ex. 170 \n¶¶ 5-6 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶¶ 6-7 (Decl. Greenberg, Warby \nParker).  DACA  grantees  also  provide  diverse  perspectives,  and  promote \ninclusiveness. Ex. 170 ¶¶ 3-9 (Decl. Schwartz, Univision); Ex. 169 ¶¶ 8-11 (Decl. \nGreenberg, Warby Parker); Ex. 174 ¶¶ 5,8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for NYC); ; \nEx. 81 ¶¶ 2-8 (Decl. Pinsky, ABNY). \n228.  The impact on small businesses and nonprofit organizations will be especially stark. \nFor entities with limited staff and operating budgets, losing even one skilled and trained DACA \ngrantee employee will place an economic strain on operations, hiring, and training. See, e.g, Ex. \n118 ¶¶ 9-11 (Decl. Igneri); Ex. 117 ¶¶ 5-8 (Decl. Tracy); Ex. 120 ¶ 4 (Decl. Romero); Ex. 119 ¶¶ \n5-6 (Decl. Tingen). Further, many DACA grantees contribute their talents to nonprofits in a range \nof fields, including education and civic engagement. See, e.g, Ex. 55  ¶¶ 8-9 (Decl. Perez); Ex 98  \n¶ 12 (Decl. 98 Naveed). \n67 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 68 of 79 PageID #: 1687\n229.  The mission of nonprofit organizations in the States will also be adversely affected. \nEx. 174 ¶¶ 3-8 (Decl. Wylde, Partnership for NYC). Many nonprofit organizations in the States \nserve immigrant communities, including by providing legal services and advocacy. Termination \nof DACA will throw families into crisis, creating higher demand for services from organizations \nwith limited resources. See Ex. 117 ¶¶ 12-14 (Decl. Tracy, Brazilian Worker Center); Ex. 115 ¶¶ \n2-7 (Decl. Tack-Hooper, Am. Civil Liberties Union of Delaware); Ex. 116 ¶¶ 2-8 (Decl. Graham). \nHarm to Families. \n230.  The States have an interest in protecting the welfare of all of their residents, \nincluding the families of DACA grantees.  \n231.  Terminating DACA will harm the general welfare of the States’ DACA grantees \nand their families in profound ways. Most DACA grantees live in households with family members \nwho are American citizens. One expert survey estimates that 73% percent of DACA grantees in \nthe country live with a citizen sibling, spouse, or child.  See Ex. 5 ¶ 34 (Decl. Wong).  Terminating \nDACA will lead to increased uncertainty in these mixed-status families, and it will increase the \nlikelihood of splitting DACA grantees from their citizen family members. See e.g., Ex. 176 ¶ 12 \n(Decl. Kennedy, City of Newburgh). Moreover, many of these families rely on the income of a \nDACA grantee, and DACA termination will threaten their financial and housing security. See, e.g., \nEx. 87 ¶ 8 (Decl. Rubin); Ex. 135 ¶ 8 (Decl. Rakes); Ex. 157 ¶¶ 12-13 (Decl. Ridder); Ex. 172 ¶¶ \n4-5, 7-8 (Decl. Morales); Ex. 173 ¶¶  3, 5-6 (Decl. Hidalgo Hernandez).  \n232.  Many  DACA  grantees  also  have  families  overseas,  including  parents  and \nsiblings.  DACA had made it possible for these grantees to visit family members, often for the first \ntime in years. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 7 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 70 ¶ 5 (Decl. I.V.). Terminating DACA \nwill cause DACA grantees to lose touch with these family members and become further estranged \n68 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 69 of 79 PageID #: 1688\nfrom their countries of origin, making the prospect of deportation even more injurious to DACA \ngrantees and their families. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection) \n233.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n234.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government \nfrom denying equal protection of the laws.  \n235.  The DHS Memorandum target individuals for discriminatory treatment, without \nlawful justification. \n236.  The DHS Memorandum was motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory motive \nand/or a desire to harm a particular group. \n237.  The discriminatory terms and application of the DHS Memorandum cannot be \nsufficiently justified by federal interests, under any standard of review. \n238.  Through  their  actions  above,  Defendants  have  violated  the  equal  protection \nguarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n239.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Due Process – Information Use) \n240.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n241.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that actions taken by the \nfederal government be fundamentally fair. \n69 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 70 of 79 PageID #: 1689\n242.  Given the federal government’s prior representations about the allowable uses of \ninformation provided by DACA applicants, the change to DHS’s policy of protecting against the \ndisclosure of information in DACA applications and renewal requests is fundamentally unfair.  \n243.  Also given the federal government’s prior representations about the allowable uses \nof information provided by DACA applicants, the new policy’s refusal to prohibit the use of \ninformation contained in DACA applications and renewal requests for purposes of immigration \nenforcement—including  identifying,  apprehending,  detaining,  or  deporting  non-citizens—is \nfundamentally unfair. \n244.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the due process guarantee \nof the Fifth Amendment. \n245.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Equitable Estoppel) \n \n246.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n247.  The doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents injustice where the government has \nmade representations on which individuals have reasonably and detrimentally relied. \n248.  In order to encourage DACA applications, Defendants made repeated, affirmative \nstatements about the protections that would be given to the personal information provided by \nDACA applicants. Defendants also placed affirmative restrictions on the use of such information \nfor purposes of immigration enforcement. \n249.  In  submitting  DACA  applications  and  renewal  requests,  DACA  applicants \nreasonably and detrimentally relied on Defendants’ affirmative representations and conduct. \n70 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 71 of 79 PageID #: 1690\n250.  Defendants should be equitably estopped from revoking DHS’s longstanding, \naffirmative policy of protecting against the disclosure of information in DACA applications and \nrenewal requests. \n251.  Equitable estoppel should also bar Defendants from implementing DHS’s new \npolicy of refusing to prohibit the use of information contained in DACA applications and renewal \nrequests for purposes of immigration enforcement, including to identify, apprehend, detain, or \ndeport non-citizens.  \n252.  Failure to estop Defendants from revoking DHS’s previous policy and imposing \nthe new policy will harm the States and their residents.  \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Substantively Arbitrary and Capricious, \nAbuse of Discretion, Contrary to Constitution or Statute) \n \n253.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n254.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), prohibits federal \nagency action that is arbitrary, unconstitutional, and contrary to statute. In implementing the DHS \nMemorandum and terminating DACA with minimal formal guidance, federal agencies have taken \nunconstitutional  and  unlawful  action,  as  alleged  herein,  in  violation  of  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act. \n255.  In promulgating and implementing the DHS Memorandum, federal agencies have \nabused their discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw, in violation of the APA. \n256.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n71 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 72 of 79 PageID #: 1691\nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Procedurally Arbitrary and Capricious,  \nNotice and Comment) \n \n257.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n258.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D), requires that federal agencies conduct \nformal rule making before engaging in action that impacts substantive rights. \n259.   DHS is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n260.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \nunder the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). \n261.  In promulgating and implementing the DHS Memorandum, federal agencies have \ncategorically and definitively changed the substantive criteria by which individual DACA grantees \nwork, live, attend school, obtain credit, and travel in the United States. Federal agencies did not \nfollow the procedures required by the APA before taking action impacting these substantive rights. \n262.   With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency rules must go through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking. 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n263.  The Defendants promulgated and relied upon the rules established by the DHS \nMemorandum without authority and without notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation of the \nAPA.  \n264.  The States will be impacted because they have not had the opportunity to comment \non the termination of DACA. \n265.   Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n \n \n72 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 73 of 79 PageID #: 1692\nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Regulatory Flexibility Act – Failure to Issue Regulatory Flexibility Analyses) \n266.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n267.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), requires federal \nagencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \nfinal versions of those analyses for public comment. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n268.  “Small  entities”  for  purposes  of  the  RFA  includes  small  businesses,  small \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions.  5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n269.  The  promulgation  and  implementation  of  the  DHS  Memorandum  established \n“rules” under the RFA. 5 U.S.C. § 601(2). \n270.  Implementation of the DHS Memorandum is likely to have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities.  5 U.S.C. § 602(a)(1). \n271.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules.  \n272.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \nviolates the RFA and is unlawful. \n273.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States, their small governmental \njurisdictions, nonprofits, and businesses, and their residents. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n (Fifth Amendment-Procedural Due Process) \n274.  The Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nin each of the preceding paragraphs of this Amended Complaint. \n73 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 74 of 79 PageID #: 1693\n275.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government \nfrom depriving individuals of their liberty interests or property interests without due process of \nlaw.  \n276.  Defendants have failed to provide DACA grantees with the due process to which \nthey are entitled, by failing to provide them with adequate notice about the procedures and timeline \nfor renewing their DACA status. \n277.  Defendants have failed to provide DACA grantees with the due process to which \nthey are entitled, by failing to give them adequate notice about the general termination of the \nDACA program after March 5, 2018 and by failing to provide DACA grantees adequate notice of \ntheir inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018. \n278.  Defendants are thus depriving Plaintiff States’ residents of their liberty and property \ninterests in living and working in the United States without providing them adequate notice or \nopportunity to be heard.  \n279.  Defendants’ conduct violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n280.  Defendants’ violations cause ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n281.  Wherefore, the States pray that the Court: \na.  Declare that the DHS Memorandum terminating the DACA program is \nunauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates; \nb.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum terminating  the DACA program are procedurally unlawful \nunder the APA; \n74 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 75 of 79 PageID #: 1694\nc.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum terminating  the DACA program are substantively unlawful \nunder the APA; \nd.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum terminating  the DACA program are unlawful under the \nRFA; \ne.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  terminating    the  DACA  program,  including \nenjoining the Defendants from limiting rights to submit applications to \nrenew DACA benefits, pending further orders from this Court; \nf.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  revoking  the  DHS  policy  protecting  DACA \napplication and renewal data from disclosure to ICE, CBP, or any other \nagency for purposes of immigration enforcement; \ng.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  using  information  obtained  in  any  DACA \napplication or renewal request to identify, apprehend, detain, or deport any \nDACA applicant or member of any DACA applicant’s family, or take any \naction against a DACA applicant’s current or former employer; and \nh.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n75 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 54   Filed 10/04/17   Page 76 of 79 PageID #: 1695\nDATED: October 4, 2017 \n \n  ERIC T.

DUKE, in her official capacity; U.S. \nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION \nSERVICES; U.S. IMMIGRATION \nAND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; \nand the UNITED STATES OF \nAMERICA, \n \n  Defendants. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The States of New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, \nDistrict Of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia (the “States”) bring this action to protect the States—\nincluding their residents, employers, regulatory systems, and educational institutions—against the \nillegal actions of the President and the federal government. On September 5, 2017, the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a Memorandum (the “DHS Memorandum”) \nending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”), a program that has protected from \ndeportation approximately 800,000 young people who grew up in this country, most of whom have \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 2 of 58 PageID #: 2\nknown no home other than the United States. Pursuant to the DHS Memorandum, the federal \ngovernment will only issue renewals for grantees whose terms expire before March 5, 2018, \nprovided they apply for renewal by October 5, 2018. DHS will immediately cease accepting new \napplications under DACA. \n2.  Since 2012, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people to live, \nstudy, and work in the United States, and to become stable and even more productive members of \ntheir communities, without fear that they could be arrested and placed in deportation proceedings \nat any moment. Throughout the country, DACA grantees are employed by various companies and \nState and municipal agencies, which benefit from their skills and productivity. DACA grantees \nalso contribute significantly to State and local revenues and tax bases. DACA recipients will also \nlose their eligibility for public and employer-based health insurance programs that reduce the \nStates’ health expenditures and promote public health. They also will lose their right to enroll in \nhigher  education  institutions  with  in-state  admissions  preferences  and  tuition;  thus,  public \nuniversities will be deprived of a means by which they enrich the experience of all students and \nfaculty through diversity and new perspectives. \n3.  More than 78 percent of DACA grantees are of Mexican origin, See Ex. 1 (USCIS, \nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017, June 8, 2017), \nwhich is more than double the percentage of people of Mexican origin that comprise of the overall \nforeign-born population (29 percent) of the United States. See Ex. 2 (U.S. Census Bureau, The \nForeign-Born Population in the United States). \n4.  Ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination \nof President’s Trump’s oft-stated commitments—whether personally held, stated to appease some \nportion of his constituency, or some combination thereof—to punish and disparage people with \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 3 of 58 PageID #: 3\nMexican roots. The consequence of the President’s animus-driven decision is that approximately \n800,000 persons who have availed themselves of the program will ultimately lose its protections, \nand will be exposed to removal when their authorizations expire and they cannot seek renewal. \nThe individuals who have relied on DACA are now more vulnerable to removal than before the \nprogram was initiated, as they turned over sensitive information to the federal government in their \napplications. Despite the federal government’s repeated promises that it would not use such \ninformation to conduct enforcement measures, the DHS Memorandum does not explain how the \ngovernment will keep that information secure, nor does it provide any assurances that immigration \nenforcement agents will not use such information to find and remove those who applied for DACA.  \n5.  Rescinding  DACA  will  cause  harm  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  the  States’ \nresidents, injure State-run colleges and universities, upset the States’ workplaces, damage the \nStates’ economies, hurt State-based companies, and disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory \ninterests. The States respectfully request that this Court invalidate the portions of the DHS \nMemorandum challenged here. Further, the States ask that the Court enjoin the federal government \nfrom using data gathered for the DACA program in immigration enforcement. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n6.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n7.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and 1391(e)(1). \nDefendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. The State of \nNew York is a resident of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to this Complaint occurred within the Eastern District of New York. \n8.  The States bring this action to redress harms to their proprietary interests and their \ninterests as parens patriae.  \nPARTIES \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF NEW YORK \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 4 of 58 PageID #: 4\n9.  The State of New York, represented by and through its Attorney General, Eric T. \nSchneiderman, is a sovereign state of the United States of America.  \n10.  The Governor is the chief executive officer of the State of New York. The Governor \nis responsible for overseeing the operations of the State of New York and ensuring that its laws \nare faithfully executed. \n11.  New York is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this action \nbecause of the injuries caused by Defendants’ rescission of DACA, including irreparable injuries \nto its proprietary, sovereign, and quasi-sovereign interests. \n12.  The Attorney General is empowered to advance New York’s strong and important \npublic policy against unlawful discrimination. New York’s Constitution guarantees all persons the \nright to equal treatment under the law and forbids discrimination based on race, color, creed or \nreligion. N.Y. Const. art. I, § 11. And New York’s statutes reiterate the State’s strong interest in \ncombatting discrimination and prejudice. N.Y. Exec. Law § 290. \n13.  According to the latest American Community Survey, New York is home to more \nthan 4.4 million foreign-born residents, including an estimated 76,000 or more DACA-eligible \nresidents. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7(c) (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). According to the United States Citizen \nand Immigration Services (“USCIS”), 41,970 initial DACA applications and 53,693 renewal \napplications from New York have been approved through the first quarter of 2017. New York was \nthe third largest source of DACA applications and approvals in the United States.   \n14.  New York State has an interest in protecting the economic health and welfare of its \nresidents. More than 91% of DACA grantees are employed. See Ex. 5 ¶ 11 (Decl. Wong). They \nwork for some of the largest companies in New York and for small and family-owned business \nthat have a significant impact on local economies in New York. Ex. 5 ¶¶ 21, 36(b) (Decl. Wong). \nAnd they provide vital services to New Yorkers in important fields such as healthcare, education, \nlaw, and social services. See Ex. 6 ¶ 13 (Decl. C.A.); Ex. 11 ¶ 8 (Decl. TFA); Ex 52 MOIA ¶ 8 \n(Decl. MOIA). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 5 of 58 PageID #: 5\n15.  Rescinding DACA will result in disruptions in each of these fields, as companies \nand non-profits will be forced to terminate qualified and trained employees who have lost \nemployment authorization. One expert estimates that rescinding the DACA program will cost New \nYork State $38.6 billion dollars over the next ten years. See Ex.  4, Table 1 (Decl. Brannon). \n16.  New York State also has a proprietary interest in maintaining a qualified workforce. \nBoth New York State and municipalities across New York have hired DACA grantees to work in \ngovernment agencies and institutions because of their specialized skills and qualifications. See Ex. \n52 ¶ 8 (Decl. MOIA); Ex. 11 ¶ 8 (Decl. TFA). These agencies and institutions have invested \nsignificant amounts of time and money to hire and train these DACA grantees.  Accordingly, the \nagencies and institutions will be adversely affected by DACA’s termination as they will lose the \nvalue of their investments as well as the services of qualified and trained employees. See Ex. 52 ¶ \n8 (Decl. MOIA); Ex. 11 ¶ 8 (Decl. TFA).   \n17.  Rescinding the DACA program will decrease New York State’s tax revenues. \nThrough work authorization, DACA grantees more effectively avoid underemployment than their \nundocumented peers and are able obtain higher wages. See Ex. 3 ¶ 4(b) (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and \nHill). Higher incomes result in higher tax revenues in New York State. In addition, DACA grantees \nhave increased purchasing power, and report buying cars and homes at significant rates. See Ex. 5 \n¶ 16 (Decl. Wong). These types of expensive purchases contribute to New York State’s tax \nrevenues in the form of sales and property taxes. According to the Institute on Taxation and \nEconomic Policy (“ITEP”), DACA-eligible individuals in New York currently contribute $140 \nmillion annually in state and local taxes.  However, the loss in employment that would result from \nrescinding DACA would decrease contributions from this population by between $55 million and \n$84 million annually. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7(c) (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill).   \n18.  The  DACA  program  has  encouraged  thousands  of  grantees  to  pursue  higher \neducation they would not otherwise have sought. See Ex. 5 ¶¶ 18-21 (Decl. Wong). Rescinding \nDACA will adversely impact current DACA grantees enrolled in colleges and universities who \nwill be unable to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships, study abroad, simultaneously \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 6 of 58 PageID #: 6\nwork to pay costs and fees, and obtain certain financial aid and scholarships. See Ex. 12 ¶¶ 7-8 \n(Decl. Milliken). Students subject to these conditions may choose to withdraw from their college \nor university. \n19.  New York State’s public colleges and universities also will be harmed if DACA is \nrescinded. Both the State University of New York (“SUNY”) and the City University of New York \n(“CUNY”) have encouraged DACA grantees to apply as part of their strong commitment to \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion. See Ex. 12 ¶ 10 (Decl. Milliken, CUNY Chancellor), and Ex. 99 \n(Decl. Johnson, SUNY Chancellor). At CUNY, hundreds of DACA grantees have enrolled in the \nuniversity, many with the benefit of full scholarships.   \n20.  Rescinding DACA will cause many high-achieving students to drop out. As a \nresult, New York’s public universities will lose the diversity and enrichment this population brings \nto the school community. Moreover, the public universities will lose the resources they have spent \non educating students who ultimately do not graduate. See Ex. 12 ¶ 8 (Decl. Milliken). \n21.  New York State has an interest in protecting the health of its residents.  Rescinding \nDACA will harm that interest by increasing the number of uninsured adults in New York and \nforcing many to avoid medical care unless and until an emergency arises. With the benefit of work \nauthorization, more than 50% of DACA grantees obtain employer-provided health insurance. See \nEx. 5 ¶ 12 (Decl. Wong). Without DACA, these individuals will be unable to obtain health \ninsurance from employers.  \n22.  In addition, rescinding DACA may prevent access to Medicaid for current DACA \ngrantees. New York State currently funds Medicaid coverage for low-income undocumented \nimmigrants who have received deferred action, including DACA-eligible immigrants. See Ex. 77 \n(Office of Health Insurance Program, Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act \n(CHIPRA); Expanded Coverage for Certain Qualified and PRUCOL Aliens, May 7, 2013). In \ncontrast, undocumented immigrants without deferred action in New York only have access to \nlimited emergency Medicaid funds. Rescinding DACA will require New York to either alter its \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 7 of 58 PageID #: 7\nregulatory  scheme  to  fund  Medicaid  for  formerly  DACA-eligible  immigrants  or  allow  this \npopulation to go uninsured and rely on state healthcare funding only in the event of emergencies.  \n23.  New York State’s quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the welfare of its residents \nincludes its interest in protecting family rights. Most DACA grantees live in households with \nAmerican citizen family members. One expert survey estimates that 73% of DACA grantees live \nwith a citizen sibling, spouse or child.  See Ex. 5 ¶ 23 (Decl. Wong).    \n24.  Rescinding deferred action will lead to increased uncertainty in these mixed-status \nfamilies, and it will increase the likelihood of splitting DACA grantees from their citizen family \nmembers. Moreover, rescission of work authorization of DACA grantees will threaten the financial \nand housing security of some of these families, especially where the DACA grantee provides \nfinancial help to his or her family. See Ex. 5 ¶ 16 (Decl. Wong).  New York’s interest in protecting \nthe rights of families would clearly be harmed by any decision to rescind deferred action or \nemployment authorization for DACA grantees in New York, thereby subjecting their families to \npotential separation, financial instability, and housing insecurity.     \n25.  Many DACA grantees also have families overseas, including parents and siblings. \nDACA permitted grantees to visit family members for the first time in years, through advance \nparole.     \n26.  Rescinding DACA would prevent current grantees in New York from visiting their \nfamilies abroad.  \nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \n27.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, represented by and through its Attorney \nGeneral, is a sovereign state of the United States of America. Massachusetts is aggrieved and has \nstanding to bring this action because of the injuries to the state caused by Defendants’ rescission \nof DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and \nproprietary interests. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 8 of 58 PageID #: 8\n28.  Massachusetts is home to more than one million immigrants, including an estimated \n19,000 or more DACA-eligible residents.[1]  See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill). \n29.  Massachusetts  also  is  home  to  many  of  the  world’s  leading  universities  and \nbusinesses.  These  institutions  rely  heavily  on  immigrants,  who  bring  tremendous  talent, \nknowledge,  and  expertise  to  academic  communities  and  to  the  labor force.  Many  of  these \nimmigrants are DACA grantees.   \n30.  As of March 31, 2017, USCIS had approved 7,934 initial DACA applications and \n10,854 renewals for residents of Massachusetts. See Ex. 1 (USCIS Data); Ex. 5 ¶ 31 (Decl. Wong). \nThe DACA program has allowed these individuals, many of whom are long-term residents of \nMassachusetts, to work legally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, access lines of \ncredit,  purchase  homes  and  cars,  receive  in-state  tuition  at  public  universities,  and  obtain \nemployer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n31.  An estimated 7,252 Massachusetts DACA grantees are employed. See Ex. 5 ¶ 32 \n(Decl. Wong).  An estimated 428 are business owners.  Id.  An estimated 3,562 are in school, and \n2,547 are currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher.  Id., ¶ 33. \n32.  Rescinding DACA will harm the ability of Massachusetts colleges and universities, \nincluding public universities, to satisfy their educational missions and prepare Massachusetts \nresidents for the workforce. See Ex. 61 ¶¶ 5-7 (Decl. UMass). \n33.  The  nation’s  leading  private  universities—many  of  which  are  located  in \nMassachusetts will suffer similar harms if DACA is rescinded.  Harvard University, for example, \nhas more than 50 DACA students currently enrolled.  See Ex. 96 ¶ 6 (Decl. Masden, Harvard \nUniversity).  Tufts University has more than 25 DACA students.  See Ex. 97 ¶ 8 (Decl. Jeka, Tufts \nUniversity.)   These students often have had to overcome significant challenges in order to gain \nacceptance and bring critical perspectives, insights, and experiences to their universities.  See Ex. \n                                                 \n[1] See Migration Policy Institute, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Data Tools, available at \nhttp://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles#overlay-\ncontext=events.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 9 of 58 PageID #: 9\n97 ¶ 5 (Tufts Decl.); Ex. 96 ¶ 5 (Harvard Decl.).  They make important and lasting contributions, \nincluding through their  classroom participation, their extracurricular engagements, and their \ncommitment to independent study and research.  See Ex. 97 (Tufts Decl.), ¶ 5; Ex. 96 ¶¶ 7, 12 \n(Harvard  Decl.).    Employment  authorization  gives  these  students  and  their  universities  an \nassurance that they may put their talents to use in the United States job market after graduation—\nsomething that benefits Massachusetts and the nation as a whole.  See Ex. 96 (Harvard Decl.), ¶ \n12.   DACA has allowed these students to step outside the shadow of their immigration status and \nto participate fully as members of academic and campus communities in ways that likely would \nnot be possible otherwise.  See Ex. 97 (Tufts Decl.), ¶ 7; Ex. 96 (Harvard Decl.), ¶ 12.  Rescinding \nDACA will take important opportunities away from DACA students and reintroduce fear and \nuncertainty into their lives, with significant adverse effects on these students, their universities, \nand the broader community.  See Ex. 97 (Tufts Decl.); Ex. 96  ¶ 13 (Harvard Decl.). \n34.  DACA grantees who are Massachusetts residents receive in-state tuition at public \nuniversities in the Commonwealth, and are eligible for a variety of scholarships.  See Ex. 7 (Mass. \nDept. of Higher Education Memorandum, Residency Status for Tuition Classification Purposes – \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Nov. 21, 2012); Ex. 61 ¶ 5 (Decl. UMass).  Without the \nDACA program, talented young immigrants will be less likely to apply to and attend state schools \nbecause they will not be able to afford tuition given the lack of available financial assistance and \nthe likelihood that they will not be able to work legally upon graduation. Those who already are \nattending  state  schools  may  be  forced  to  drop  out.   See,  e.g.,  ¶  5  Ex.  61  (University  of \nMassachusetts Decl.); Ex. 72 ¶ 5 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 8, 10 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 60 ¶¶ 6, 9 \n(Decl. Guevara Decl.).   \n35.  DACA students in graduate programs at public universities in the Commonwealth, \nin particular, will be significantly affected because the loss of employment authorization needed \nfor graduate assistantship (research or teaching) will likely mean the loss of tuition waivers and \nother benefits such as subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance for the students and their \nfamilies.  Ex. 61 ¶ 5 (UMass Decl.). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 10 of 58 PageID #: 10\n36.  In addition, DACA students in both undergraduate or graduate programs, including \nresearch and teaching programs, that require students to have employment  authorization to \ncomplete elements of the program—such as paid internships, residency training, and graduate \nassistantships—will be severely impacted if DACA is rescinded.  Ex. 61 ¶ 6 (UMass Decl.). \n37.  Losing these talented young immigrants will deprive Massachusetts state schools \nof the special contributions and perspectives they bring to campus communities, both as students \nand alumni. Ex. 61 ¶ 7 (UMass Decl.). If current DACA students are forced to drop out, the \nUniversity of Massachusetts also will lose the value of the financial assistance it has granted to \nand  the  other  resources  it  has  spent  educating  students  who  ultimately  do  not \ngraduate.  Id.  Rescinding DACA also will impose additional tangible costs on our state schools, \nwhich already have begun to experience disruption as a result of uncertainty over the future of the \nprogram and are preparing for the likelihood of increased institutional funds needed to help DACA \nstudents meet the loss of employment.  Ex. 61 ¶¶ 8-9 (UMass Decl.).   \n38.  Rescinding DACA will further deprive Massachusetts of the earning potential of \ngraduates  from  public  universities  who  are  most  likely  to  stay  here  and  join  the  state’s \nworkforce.  Nine out of ten Massachusetts public higher education graduates remain in the state, \nworking or pursuing further education. See Ex. 93 (Mass. Dept. of Higher Education, Time to Lead, \nThe Need for Excellence in Public Higher Education, Sept. 2012).  \n39.  Rescinding DACA will cause Massachusetts to lose qualified state employees.  A \nnumber of DACA grantees work in government or at state-run institutions. See, e.g., Ex. 70 ¶ 6 \n(Decl. I.V.); Ex. 61 ¶ 10 (University of Massachusetts Decl.).  Massachusetts has expended time \nand resources to hire, train, and manage DACA grantees. If these individuals become ineligible to \nwork, Massachusetts will lose the value of its investment and the services of employees who \nperform important functions for the state.   \n40.  Rescinding DACA will jeopardize the state’s licensing scheme for drivers.  Under \nDACA, thousands of young Massachusetts residents are able to receive social security cards and \nthereby have access to driver’s licenses, which they depend on to attend heath care appointments, \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 11 of 58 PageID #: 11\nto commute to work and school, and to attend to other necessities for themselves and their family \nmembers.  Ex. 9 (Mass. Registry of Motor Vehicles, Social Security Number (SSN) Requirements); \nSee, e.g., Ex. 71 ¶¶ 5-7, 9 (Decl. I.T.); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 70 ¶¶ 5, 8 (Decl. \nI.V.).  Rescinding DACA will make it impossible for these individuals to apply for new licenses \nor renew the licenses they have, leading to a number of potential outcomes, including a decrease \nin productivity of these residents and an increase in unlicensed drivers on the road.   \n41.  Rescinding DACA will harm public health and impose additional health care costs \non the state. Work authorization allows DACA recipients to access employer-sponsored health \nbenefits. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 4 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 69 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Mendes Decl.).  Without these \nbenefits, more Massachusetts residents are likely to forgo needed health care, including preventive \ncare, which will create more costly health problems in the long run. It also will cause more people \nto rely on state-funded and/or state-administered public health care and other benefits, and thus \nimpose additional costs on the state. Through its MassHealth Limited and Children’s Medical \nSecurity Plan programs, Massachusetts offers health care benefits to residents whose immigration \nstatus  otherwise  keeps  them  from  accessing  health  care  benefits  and  services.  In  addition, \nMassachusetts’ state-administered Health Safety Net program reimburses hospitals for emergency \nand urgent services provided to uninsured patients and pays community health centers for certain \npreventive services, all irrespective of immigration status. \n42.  Rescinding DACA will harm the general welfare of Massachusetts DACA grantees \nand their families. Most DACA grantees live in households with family members who are \nAmerican citizens. One expert survey estimates that 73% of DACA grantees in Massachusetts live \nwith a citizen sibling, spouse, or child.  See Ex. 5 (Wong Decl.), ¶ 34.  Many of these families rely \non the income of DACA grantees.  See, e.g., Ex. 69 ¶¶ 6, 10 (Decl. Mendes); Ex. 60 ¶ 5 (Decl. \nGuevara).   Many  DACA  grantees  also  have  families  overseas,  including  parents  and \nsiblings.  DACA had made it possible for these grantees to visit family members, often for the first \ntime in years. See, e.g., Ex. 72 ¶ 7 (Decl. Teodoro); Ex. 70 ¶ 5 (Decl. I.V.). Rescinding DACA will \nharm all of these families in profound ways. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 12 of 58 PageID #: 12\n43.  Rescinding DACA also will hurt the Massachusetts economy. Stripping DACA \ngrantees of the ability to work legally will cause many to lose their jobs, resulting, among other \nthings, in less tax revenue for the state.  According to one estimate, DACA-eligible residents \ncontribute approximately $24 million annually in state and local taxes in Massachusetts—a \ncontribution that may drop by $9 million without DACA. See Ex. 3 ¶ 7 (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and \nHill). Another estimate suggests that ending DACA would, over a ten-year period, cost the \nMassachusetts economy $258 million in lost tax revenue and $924.5 million overall.  Brannon \nDecl., Table 1.   \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF WASHINGTON \n44.  Washington is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this \naction because of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by Defendants’ rescission of \nDACA,  including  immediate  and  irreparable  injuries  to  its  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and \nproprietary interests. \n45.  The Governor is the chief executive officer of the State of Washington. The \nGovernor is responsible for overseeing the operations of the State of Washington and ensuring that \nits laws are faithfully executed. \n46.  The Attorney General is the chief legal adviser to the State of Washington. The \nAttorney General’s powers and duties include acting in federal court on matters of public concern. \n47.  Washington  has  declared  that  practices  that  discriminate  against  any  of  its \ninhabitants because of race, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the \nrights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the \npeople. See Wash. Rev. Code 49.60.010. \n48.  Washington’s  interest  in  protecting  the  health,  safety,  and  well-being  of  its \nresidents, including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a \nquasi-sovereign interest.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 13 of 58 PageID #: 13\n49.  Washington also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from \nthe benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law.  \n50.  Washington’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of Washington’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public.  \n51.  As of March 2017, Washington is home to more than 17,800 DACA recipients. See \nEx. 1 (USCIS Data). Participating in the DACA program has allowed these individuals, many of \nwhom are long-term residents of Washington, to work legally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank \naccounts, access lines of credit, purchase homes and cars, receive in-state tuition at public \nuniversities, and obtain employer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n52.  Immigration is an important economic driver in Washington. Many Washington \nworkers are immigrants, and many of those immigrant workers are DACA recipients. See Ex. 5 ¶¶ \n12, 13 (Decl. Wong) Many companies in Washington are dependent on DACA grantees to operate \nand grow their businesses. DACA recipients work for our State’s largest companies as software \nengineers, finance professionals, and retail and sales associates, including for Amazon, Microsoft \nand Starbucks Ex. 63 ¶¶ 4-5 (Decl. Blackwell-Hawkins, Amazon); Ex. 90  ¶¶ 7-12, 14 (Decl. \nShively, Microsoft); Ex. 8 ¶¶ 7-8 (Decl. Mutty, Starbucks). \n53.  The market for highly skilled workers and employees is extremely competitive. Id. \nRescinding the work authorization of DACA recipients will inhibit Washington companies’ ability \nto adequately staff their organizations, develop their workforces, and recruit talent. If recruiting \nefforts are less successful, these companies’ abilities to develop and deliver successful products \nand services may be adversely affected. Id. \n54.  Rescinding  DACA  will  likewise  cause  Washington  to  lose  qualified  state \nemployees. See e.g., Ex. 56 ¶¶ 2-4 (Decl. Quinonez). Many DACA recipients work in government \nor at state-run institutions. See Ex. 62 ¶ 3 (Decl. Monroe, Dept. of Ecology); Ex. 65 ¶ 3 (Decl. \nKaplan, Dept. of Social and Health Svcs.); Ex. 92 ¶ 3 (Decl. Jones, Treasury); Ex. 91 ¶ 3 (Decl. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 14 of 58 PageID #: 14\nGarza, Big Bend Community College); Ex. 64 ¶ 3 (Decl. Glatt, Columbia Basin College); Ex. 58 \n¶ 4 (Decl. Loera, Washington State University). These employees were hired because of their \nspecialized skills and qualifications.  \n55.  Washington expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage DACA recipients. \nIf these individuals become ineligible to work, Washington will lose the value of its investment \nand the services of employees who perform important functions for the state. \n56.  Rescinding DACA will harm the ability of Washington universities, including \npublic universities, to satisfy their educational missions and prepare Washington residents for the \nworkforce. According to the Washington Student Achievement Council, the state agency that \nadvances educational opportunities in the state, there are more than 1,400 DACA students in \nWashington attending institutions of higher education. See Ex. 59 ¶ 9 (Decl. Thompson, WSAC).  \n57.  The University of Washington and Washington State University are the two largest \npublic universities in the State. More than one hundred DACA grantees attend the University of \nWashington, based in Seattle. See Ex. 57 ¶ 4 (Decl. Ballinger, University of Washington). More \nthan 150 DACA grantees attend Washington State University, based in Pullman. See Ex. 58 ¶ 4 ( \nDecl. Loera, Washington State University).  \n58.  The  DHS  Memorandum  will  likely  cause  some  DACA  recipients  to  leave \nWashington colleges and universities. The cost of a college education may make little sense for \nstudents unable to work following graduation. See, Ex. 56 ¶ 7 (Decl. Quinonez).  Future DACA \nstudents may be prevented from enrolling. These harms damage the educational mission of \nWashington’s institutions of higher education and affect their tuition revenues. See Ex. 57 ¶¶ 4-6 \n(Decl. Ballinger, University of Washington); Ex. 58 ¶¶ 4-8 (Decl. Loera, Washington State \nUniversity). \n59.  Rescinding DACA also will hurt the Washington economy. Stripping DACA \nrecipients of the ability to work legally will cause many to lose their jobs, resulting, among other \nthings, in less tax revenue for the state. According to one estimate, DACA-eligible residents \ncontribute approximately $51 million annually in state and local taxes in Washington. See Ex. 3 ¶ \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 15 of 58 PageID #: 15\n7(d) (Decl. Essig, Wiehe and Hill); Ex. 55 ¶¶ 5-7 (Decl. Perez ). Another estimate suggests that \nending DACA would, over a ten-year period, cost the Washington economy $258 million in lost \ntax revenue and $6.4 billion in GDP growth. See Ex. 4, Table 1 (Decl. Brannon). DACA recipients \naverage higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers and are able to better participate \nin our economy, for example by purchasing homes and cars that are taxed by our state and local \nauthorities. See Ex. 5 ¶¶ 10-13 (Decl. Wong).  \n60.  In  sum,  the  DHS  Memorandum’s  rescission  of  DACA  affects  Washington’s \neconomy, residents, families, educational institutions, state agencies, and businesses. \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF CONNECTICUT \n61.  Connecticut is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this \naction because of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by Defendants’ rescission of \nDACA,  including  immediate  and  irreparable  injuries  to  its  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and \nproprietary interests.  Attorney General George Jepsen brings this action on behalf of Connecticut \nat the request of Governor Dannel P. Malloy to protect the interests of Connecticut and its \nresidents. \n62.  Connecticut has an interest, as evidenced by its Constitution and state law, in \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. See Conn. Const. art. First, \n§ 20; Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46a-58. \n63.  Connecticut's  interest  in  protecting  the  health,  safety,  and  well-being  of  its \nresidents, including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a \nquasi-sovereign interest.  \n64.  Connecticut also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from \nthe benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 16 of 58 PageID #: 16\n65.  Connecticut's interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of Connecticut’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public.  \n66.  As of March 31, 2017, USCIS had approved 4,929 initial DACA applications and \n5,882 renewals for residents of Connecticut, for a total of 10,811. See Ex. 1 (USCIS Data). The \nDACA  program  has  allowed  these  individuals,  many  of  whom  are  long-term  residents  of \nConnecticut, to work legally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, \npurchase homes and cars, receive in-state tuition at public universities, and obtain employer-based \nhealth insurance, among other benefits.    \n67.  Connecticut provides in-state tuition to DACA recipients at its public universities \nand colleges.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 10a-29.  The Defendants' actions will likely cause some DACA \nrecipients to leave Connecticut colleges and universities. These harms damage the educational \nmission of Connecticut’s institutions of higher education and affect their tuition revenues.  \n68.  Rescinding DACA also will hurt the Connecticut economy. Stripping DACA \nrecipients of the ability to work legally will cause many to lose their jobs, resulting, among other \nthings, in less tax revenue for the state.   \n69.  In sum, Defendants' actions affect Connecticut’s economy, residents, families, \neducational institutions, state agencies, and businesses. \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF DELAWARE \n70.  The State of Delaware has a strong interest in retaining the DACA program.  USCIS \nhas approved approximately 1,450 initial applications from DACA grantees since 2012. See Ex. 1 \n(USCIS Data). One expert estimates that of that total, at least 1,256 DACA grantees currently work \nin Delaware’s economy. See Ex. 53 (Nicole Prchal Svajlenka, A New Threat to DACA Could Cost \nStates Billions of Dollars, Center for American Progress, July 21, 2017) \n71.  Defendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to \nits sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests.  If DACA is terminated, these grantees \nwill lose their work authorization.  The resulting loss in employment will cause significant loses \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 17 of 58 PageID #: 17\nin tax revenue and Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”).  Over ten years, Delaware can expect to lose \n$258 million in tax revenues, and $924.5 million in GDP with the loss of DACA. See Ex. 4 Table \n1 (Brannon Decl.). \n72.   Moreover,  rescinding  DACA  would  adversely  impact  Delaware’s  public \nuniversities.  Currently, about 75 DACA grantees attend Delaware State University (“DSU”).  See \nEx. 81 (Scott Gross, DSU immigrant students fear Trump’s DACA decision, Delawareonline, Sept. \n2 2017). These high achieving students contribute to the university’s mission to advance diversity \nand inclusion. These students would be less likely to continue pursuing their education at DSU if \nthere is no viable employment option available to them upon graduation.   \nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n73.  The District of Columbia is a municipal corporation empowered to sue and be sued, \nand is the local government for the territory constituting the permanent seat of the federal \ngovernment. The District is represented by and through its chief legal officer, the Attorney General \nfor the District of Columbia. The Attorney General has general charge and conduct of all legal \nbusiness of the District and all suits initiated by and against the District and is responsible for \nupholding the public interest. DC Code § 1-301.81(a)(1). \n74.  The District has declared its intent to end discrimination based on race, color, \nreligion, or national origin. DC Code § 2-1401.01.  \n75.  The  District’s  interest  in  protecting  the  health,  safety,  and  well-being  of  its \nresidents, including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a \nquasi-sovereign interest. \n76.  The District also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from \nthe benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law.  \n77.  The District has a compelling interest in that the Constitution and federal law of the \nU.S. are enforced and protect their residents as designed. In addition, the District has an interest in \nprotecting its economy and residents.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 18 of 58 PageID #: 18\n78.  Defendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to \nits sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests.   \n79.  The District’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of the District’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public.  \n80.  The District has an interest in protecting its residents’ family rights.  Most DACA \nrecipients live in households with American citizen family members.   \n81.  The rescission of DACA will lead to increased uncertainty in these families, and \nwill  increase  the  likelihood  of  splitting  DACA  recipients  from  their  citizen  family \nmembers. Moreover, the rescission of DACA will make employment of DACA recipients more \ndifficult and will threaten the financial and housing security of some of these families, especially \nwhere the DACA recipient is head of household. The District’s interest in protecting the rights of \nfamilies is clearly harmed by the rescission of DACA, and subjects DACA families to potential \nseparation, financial instability, and housing insecurity.    \n82.  Many  DACA  recipients  also  have  families  overseas,  including  parents  and \nsiblings. DACA  permitted  these  recipients  to  visit  these  family  members  through  advance \nparole. The rescission of DACA will prevent recipients from taking the risk of visiting their \nfamilies abroad. \n83.  Immigrants are an important part of the District’s economy. Many of the District’s \nworkers and students are immigrants and many of those immigrants are DACA recipients.  \n84.  Many DACA recipients attend the colleges and universities in the District as post-\nsecondary and graduate students. The rescission of DACA will have an adverse effect on both the \nstudents and the colleges and universities. The rescission of DACA will likely cause some DACA \nrecipients  to  leave  District  colleges  and  universities.  Future  DACA  students  will  likely  be \nprevented  from  enrolling.  These  harms  damage  the  educational  mission  of  the  District’s \ninstitutions of higher education and affect their revenues. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 19 of 58 PageID #: 19\n85.  DACA recipients also work for the District government and District businesses. \nThe District government and businesses have expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage \nDACA grantees, and will lose the value of that investment—and in the employees’ ongoing \nlabor—if employees are not able to continue to work and travel due to DACA’s rescission. \n86.  DACA recipients contribute to the District’s tax base by, for example, purchasing \nhomes and cars that are taxed by the District. The District will lose tax revenue as a result of the \nrescission of DACA. \n87.  The rescission of DACA affects District residents, families and businesses, as well \nas harms the District’s proprietary interests. \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF HAWAII \n88.  The State of Hawaii represented by and through its Attorney General, is a sovereign \nstate of the United States of America. Hawaii is aggrieved and has standing to bring this action \nbecause of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by Defendants’ rescission of DACA, \nincluding immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \ninterests. \n89.  Hawaii is a state of 1.4 million residents, almost 18% of whom are foreign born.  \nSee Ex. 2. \n90.  Almost 600 young people in Hawaii have passed background checks and live and \nwork legally in Hawaii as a direct result of DACA. See Ex. 1 (USCIS Data). \n91.  Hawaii is home to many places of higher education and businesses, which rely \nheavily on immigrants, who bring tremendous talent, knowledge, and expertise to academic \ncommunities and to the labor force.  Many of these immigrants are DACA grantees.   \n92.  By  the  latest  available  numbers,  USCIS  had  approved  558  initial  DACA \napplications and 1,740 renewals for residents of Hawaii. Obtaining DACA status has allowed these \nindividuals, many of whom are long-term residents of Hawaii, to work legally, acquire driver’s \nlicenses, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, purchase homes and cars, receive in-state \ntuition at public universities, and obtain employer-based health insurance, among other benefits.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 20 of 58 PageID #: 20\n93.  Rescinding DACA will harm the ability of Hawaii colleges and universities, \nincluding public universities, to satisfy their educational missions and prepare Hawaii residents \nfor the workforce. There are currently 13 DACA students enrolled for classes in fall 2017 at the \nUniversity of Hawaii’s ten campuses. See Ex. 73 (University of Hawai’i, UH and State Leaders \nRespond to DACA Program Termination, Sept. 5, 2017). \n94.  DACA grantees who are Hawaii residents are eligible for certain benefits at the \nUniversity of Hawaii. According to David Lassner, President of the University of Hawaii, “[o]ver \nfour years ago the University of Hawaii Board of Regents adopted a policy to extend eligibility for \nresident tuition rates to undocumented students, including but not limited to those who have filed \nfor DACA.” See Ex. 73 (University of Hawai’i, UH and State Leaders Respond to DACA Program \nTermination, Sept. 5, 2017). \n95.  Losing these talented young immigrants will deprive Hawaii state schools of the \nspecial contributions and perspectives they bring to campus communities, both as students and \nalumni. If current DACA students are forced to drop out, the University of Hawaii also will lose \nthe value of the financial assistance it has granted to, and the other resources it has spent, educating \nstudents who ultimately do not graduate.  \n96.  Rescinding DACA will further deprive Hawaii of the earning potential of graduates \nfrom public universities who are likely to stay here and join the state’s workforce. Ending DACA \nwould cost Hawaii more than $28.8 million in annual GDP losses. See Ex. 53 (Center for American \nProgress, A New Threat to DACA Could Cost States Billions of Dollars, Jul. 21, 2017). \n97.  Over the next ten years Hawaii also stands to lose $126 million in tax revenues and \n$451.5 million in further GDP losses if DACA is rescinded. \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF ILLINOIS \n98.  The State of Illinois, by and through its Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, is a \nsovereign state of the United States of America.  Illinois is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and \nhas standing to bring this action because of harm to Illinois’ state institutions and economy, \nincluding immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign and proprietary interests.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 21 of 58 PageID #: 21\n99.  Between FY 2012 and FY 2017, 42,376 individuals residing in Illinois have been \napproved for the DACA program, and 37,039 individuals have renewed a DACA application.  Ex. \n1. \n100.  Approximately 36,867 DACA recipients work in the state of Illinois and contribute \nto the Illinois economy. Should those workers be removed from Illinois, the state economy would \nsuffer approximately $2.3 billion in annual GDP loss.  Ex. 53. \n101.  ITEP estimates that Illinois would lose approximately $54.7 million in local and \nstate tax revenue if DACA protections are eliminated. Ex. 54 (Misha E. Hill and Meg Wiehe, State \n& Local Tax Contributions of Young Undocumented Immigrants, Institute on Taxation and \nEconomic Policy, April 25, 2017).   \n102.  Illinois also has enacted laws to enable DACA grantees to participate in the \neconomy professionally. These include providing that no person in Illinois shall be prohibited from \nreceiving a law license solely because he or she is not a citizen and explicitly allowing DACA \nrecipients to apply for a license to practice law within the state of Illinois. 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. \n205/2.  \n103.  Furthermore, Illinois has enacted laws and implemented government programs to \nsupport DACA participants.  Elimination of DACA would harm these programs. \n104.  For  example,  Illinois  law  has  been  amended  to  facilitate  and  encourage  the \nattendance of DACA grantees at public universities in Illinois. DACA participants may obtain in-\nstate tuition to attend Illinois’s public universities. 110 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/7e-5. Illinois’s public \nuniversities also accept and provide resources for DACA recipients. See Ex. 66 (University of \nIllinois at Chicago, Resources for Undocumented Students); Ex. 67 (Illinois State University, \nAdmissions and Financial Aid for Undocumented Student Admissions; Ex. 68 (University of \nIllinois, Undocumented Applicants, Illinois Admissions).  \n105.  Furthermore, through the Illinois Dream Act, Public Law No. 97-0233, Illinois law \npermits  anyone  with  a  valid  social  security  number  or  taxpayer  number,  including  DACA \nrecipients, to participate in state-run college financing programs, such as the State Treasurer’s \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 22 of 58 PageID #: 22\nCollege Savings Pool, 15 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/16.5, and the Illinois Prepaid Tuition Plan, 110 Ill. \nComp. Stat. 979/45.   \n106.  Illinois has an interest in ensuring that the investments made in the education of \nDACA grantees attending Illinois’s public universities through scholarships and financial aid are \nnot diminished by a disruption in the DACA program.   \n107.  A rescission of the DACA program also would disrupt Illinois employers who \nemploy DACA grantees, resulting in economic loss to the state of Illinois and Illinois employers.  \nFurthermore, Illinois would be harmed by the loss of local and state tax revenue due to the removal \nof DACA program protections for Illinois workers. One expert estimates that rescinding the \nDACA program will cost Illinois $6.9 billion over the next ten years.  Ex. 3 Table 1 (Decl. \nBannon). \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF IOWA \n108.  The State of Iowa, represented by and through its Attorney General, Tom Miller, is \na sovereign state of the United States of America.   Iowa is aggrieved by Defendants’ action and \nhas standing to bring this action because of harm to Iowa’s state institutions and economy, \nincluding immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \ninterests. \n109.  The State of Iowa has a strong interest in retaining the DACA program.  As of \nMarch 31, 2017, USCIS had approved approximately 2,798 initial DACA applications and 2,780 \nrenewals for residents of Iowa, for a total of 5,578.  Ex. 1 (USCIS Data).  One expert estimates \nthat of that total, at least 2,434 DACA grantees currently work in Iowa’s economy.  Ex. 53 (Nicole \nPrchal Svajlenka, A New Threat to DACA Could Cost States Billions of Dollars, Center for \nAmerican Progress, July 21, 2017).   \n110.  If DACA is terminated, these grantees will lose their work authorization.  The \nresulting loss in employment will cause significant losses in tax revenue and Gross Domestic \nProduct (“GDP”).  Over ten years, Iowa can expect to lose $258 million in tax revenues, and \n$924.5 million in GDP with the loss of DACA.  Ex. 4 Table 1 (Brannon Decl.). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 23 of 58 PageID #: 23\n111.  Iowa has an interest, as evidenced by its Constitution and state law, in prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.  See Iowa Const. art. I, Iowa Code \nChapter 216. \n112.  Iowa’s interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its residents, \nincluding protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a quasi-\nsovereign interest. \n113.  Iowa also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from the \nbenefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n114.  Iowa’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, safety, \nand well-being extends to all of Iowa’s residents, including individuals who suffer indirect injuries \nand members of the general public. \n115.  In sum, Defendants’ actions affect Iowa’s economy, residents, families, educational \ninstitutions, state agencies, and businesses. \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF NEW MEXICO \n116.  The State of New Mexico, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \nsovereign state of the United States of America.  New Mexico is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions \nand has  standing to bring this action because of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by \nDefendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, \nquasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n117.  According to the latest American Community Survey, New Mexico is home to \nmore than 211,249 foreign-born residents, of whom approximately 7,000 are DACA-eligible \nresidents.   \n118.  Foreign-born residents of New Mexico constitute more than 10% of the State’s \npopulation.  Some 34.4% of the foreign-born New Mexicans—72,652 persons—are naturalized \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 24 of 58 PageID #: 24\ncitizens eligible to vote in New Mexico. In 2010, 8.4% of all business owners in New Mexico were \nforeign-born, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. \n119.  Immigrants  comprised 12.6%  of  the  state’s  workforce in 2013 (or  122,131 \nworkers), according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \n120.  Of the 876,000 recipients of deferred action nationwide, 7,300 live in New Mexico, \naccording to the latest figures provided by the USCIS. \n121.  ITEP estimates that New Mexico could lose up to $7.5 million in state and local \ntaxes if DACA were eliminated. \n122.  An estimated 5.9% (or 57,438) of registered voters in New Mexico were “New \nAmericans”—naturalized citizens or the U.S.-born children of immigrants who were raised during \nthe current era of immigration from Latin America and Asia which began in 1965—according to \nan analysis of 2012 Census Bureau data by American Immigration Council.  \n123.  DACA-eligible residents are estimated to contribute more than $19 million in New \nMexico’s state and local taxes, a figure of particular importance in a state often ranked as among \nthe poorest in the country. DACA-eligible residents are part of the State’s near-majority Latino \npopulation, which wields some $24.9 billion in consumer purchasing power, and are also part of \nthe increasing numbers of Asian families in the State. \n124.  The 2014 purchasing power of Latinos in New Mexico totaled $23.4 billion—an \nincrease of 374% since 1990. Asian buying power totaled $1.5 billion—an increase of 724% since \n1990, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia. \n125.  Immigration boosts housing values in communities, and increases in housing values \nadds to the health of New Mexico’s economy. From 2000 to 2010, according to the Americas \nSociety/Council of the Americas, the value added by immigration to the price of the average home \nwas $2,654 in Bernalillo, the State’s most populous county.  \n126.  New Mexico’s 37,195 Latino-owned businesses had sales and receipts of $6.5 \nbillion and employed 50,021 people in 2007, the last year for which data is available. The state’s \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 25 of 58 PageID #: 25\n3,321 Asian-owned businesses  had sales  and  receipts  of  $1.1  billion  and  employed  10,739 \npeople in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Business Owners. \n \n127.  From 2006 to 2010, there were 11,440 new immigrant business owners in New \nMexico, and they had total net business income of $389 million, which makes up 8.9% of all net \nbusiness income in the state, according to Robert Fairlie of the University of California, Santa \nCruz. \n128.  New  Mexico’s  3,711 foreign  students  contributed  $85.1  million to  the  state’s \neconomy  in tuition, fees, and living expenses  for the 2013-2014  academic  year, according \nto NAFSA: Association of International Educators. \n129.  Foreign students contribute to New Mexico’s metropolitan areas. From 2008 to \n2012, according to the Brookings Institution, 1,848 foreign students paid $17.8 million in tuition \nand $11.3 million in living costs in the Las Cruces metropolitan area. \n \n130.  Foreign students also contribute to innovation in New Mexico. In 2009, “non-\nresident aliens” comprised 42.1% of master’s degrees and 42.9% of doctorate degrees in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, according to the Partnership for a New \nAmerican Economy.  \n131.  Latinos in New Mexico paid $2.7 billion in federal taxes and $1.3 billion in \nstate/local taxes in 2013, according to the Partnership for a New American Economy. In particular, \nforeign-born Latinos paid $463 million in federal taxes and $252 million in state/local taxes. \n132.  The federal tax contribution of New Mexico’s Latino population included $1.9 \nbillion to Social Security and $441 million to Medicare in 2013. Foreign-born Latinos contributed \n$356 million to Social Security and $83 million to Medicare that year. \n133.  Unauthorized immigrants comprised roughly 4.7% of the state’s workforce (or \n45,000 workers) in 2012, according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center. If all unauthorized \nimmigrants were removed from New Mexico, the state would lose $1.8 billion in economic \nactivity, $809.1 million in gross state product, and approximately 12,239 jobs, even accounting for \nadequate market adjustment time, according to a report by the Perryman Group.  \n134.  Rescinding DACA in New Mexico will adversely impact current DACA grantees \nenrolled in New Mexico’s colleges and universities.  Without DACA’s employment authorization, \nthese students will be unable to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships, study abroad, \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 26 of 58 PageID #: 26\nsimultaneously work to pay costs and fees, or obtain certain financial aid and scholarships.  \nWithout  these  students,  New  Mexico’s  institutions  of  higher  education  will  suffer  loss  of \nenrollment, a reduction in diversity and negative financial consequences. \n135.  Significantly, it is common for New Mexico’s families to include both U.S.-born \nand foreign born members.  Rescinding DACA will jeopardize the health, security and stability of \nNew Mexico families by forcing separation and alienation.  \n136.  New Mexico has a continuing interest in protecting and securing the safety and \nstability of its families, and that interest mandates the State’s involvement in this litigation. \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \n137.  The State of North Carolina, represented by Attorney General Josh Stein, is a \nsovereign state of the United States of America.  North Carolina has standing to bring this action \nbecause it has suffered and will continue to suffer injuries to its sovereignty as a state caused by \nDefendants'  rescission  of  DACA.    These  harms  include  injuries  to  North  Carolina's  state \ninstitutions and economy, including to its sovereign and proprietary interests. \n138.  North Carolina has an interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its \nresidents, including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health. \n139.  According  to  USCIS,  27,385  initial  DACA  applications  and  22,327  renewal \napplications from North Carolina have been approved through the second quarter of 2017. See Ex. \n1. \n140.  Immigration is a vital catalyst to North Carolina's economy.  According to a study \nconducted by the Latino Migration Project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in \n1990, only 1.7% of the State's population was foreign-born.  By 2014, that proportion had \nincreased to 7.6%.  This demographic change is due, in large part, to industries' recruitment of \nforeign-born individuals, primarily of Latin American origin to fill available jobs that have been \ncreated as a result of the expansion of North Carolina's economy. See Ex. 87 (Latino Migration \nProject, DACA Program in North Carolina, Perspectives from Immigrants and Community-Based \nOrganizations, Jan. 2017). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 27 of 58 PageID #: 27\n141.  By 2012, as estimated 350,000 people (44% of the state's immigrant population) \ndid not have legal immigration status. See Ex. 81 (Pew Research Center, U.S. Unauthorized \nImmigration Population Estimates, Mar. 2015).  \n142.  After the institution of the DACA program in 2012, North Carolina had one of the \nhighest application rates to DACA in the nation.  Out of an estimated 26,000 eligible people, 75% \nhad  applied  to  the  DACA  program.    By  June  2014,  USCIS  had  approved  almost  21,000 \napplications. See Ex. 1 . \n143.  North Carolina has one of the largest undocumented high school populations in \nthe country, with close to 31,000 undocumented students enrolled as of 2015. See Ex. 82 \n(Technician, Immigrants Still Face Obstacles To Go To College Despite DACA, Mar. 2015) . \nThere are a total of 16 public universities in North Carolina, enrolling nearly 225,000 students. \nSee Ex. 83 (University of North Carolina, Our 17 campuses). Affected students attend these \nuniversities, as well as North Carolina's community and technical colleges.   Rescinding DACA \npermits will cause students currently enrolled to leave North Carolina community and technical \ncolleges and universities.  In addition, future DACA students may be prevented from finishing \ntheir high school education or from enrolling in North Carolina's colleges and universities.  \nThese harms damage the educational mission of North Carolina's institutions of higher learning \nand affect their tuition revenues.  \n144.  According to the 2010 census, North Carolina is the ninth wealthiest state in terms \nof gross domestic product. See Ex. 85( Greyhill Advisors, GDP By State).  Charlotte, North \nCarolina's largest city is the second largest banking center in the United States. See Ex. 84 (North \nCarolina History Project, Charlotte Soars To Become The Nation’s Second Largest Financial \nCenter). The Research Triangle Park, home to more than 170 companies and federal agencies, is \nthe largest and oldest continuously operating research and science park in the United States. See \nEx. 86 (Research Triangle Park).  The market to employ skilled workers to fuel these expanding \neconomies is highly competitive.  Rescinding work authorization for DACA recipients will cripple \nthe ability for North Carolina's companies to attract and maintain a robust workforce, adversely \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 28 of 58 PageID #: 28\naffecting the companies' ability to develop and deliver products and services.  In addition, the \ninability to maintain a workforce may induce companies to relocate out of North Carolina.  \n145.  DACA recipients make significant contributions to North Carolina's tax base.  The \nDACA program has encouraged tens of thousands of individuals to secure driver's licenses, \ncontinue their education, obtain employment, secure better employment or benefits, and integrate \nthemselves into the fabric of North Carolina society. \n146.  The rescission of DACA creates upheaval in the operation of state-run programs, \nincluding programs relating to public benefits and scholarships, as well as in the operation of North \nCarolina's private economy. One expert estimates that rescinding the DACA program will cost \nNorth Carolina 7.8 billion dollars over the next ten years. See Ex.  4 (Decl. Brannon, Table 1). \n147.  As a result of the DHS Memorandum, North Carolina's residents, families, and \nbusinesses will suffer physical and economic harms.  In addition, DHS Memorandum also harms \nNorth Carolina's proprietary interests. \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF OREGON \n148.  Oregon is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this action \nbecause of its injuries caused by Defendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate, long-\nterm, and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n149.  The Governor is the chief executive officer of the State of Oregon. The Governor \nis responsible for overseeing the operations of the State of Oregon and ensuring that its laws are \nfaithfully executed. \n150.  The Attorney General is the chief legal officer of the State of Oregon. The Attorney \nGeneral’s powers and duties include acting in federal court on matters of public concern and at the \nrequest of state agencies and officials. \n151.  Oregon has codified its state policy that practices of unlawful discrimination against \nany of its inhabitants because of religion or national origin are “a matter of state concern,” and that \nsuch discrimination “menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state.” Or. Rev. \nStat. § 659A.006. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 29 of 58 PageID #: 29\n152.  Oregon’s interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its residents, \nincluding protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a quasi-\nsovereign interest.  \n153.  Oregon also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from the \nbenefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law.  \n154.  Oregon’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of Oregon’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public.  \n155.  Oregon has a strong interest in promoting employment and business creation and \nin the tax revenues that result. \n156.  Oregon is home to more than 11,000 DACA recipients, many of whom are long-\nterm residents of Oregon. See Ex. 1. The DACA program has allowed these individuals to work \nlegally, acquire driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, access lines of credit, purchase homes and \ncars, obtain employer-based health insurance, among other benefits. Oregon also has many \nindividuals who would have become eligible for DACA in the coming months or  years if \nDefendants had not acted to end the program. \n157.  Immigration is an important economic driver in Oregon. Many Oregon workers are \nimmigrants, and many of those immigrant workers are DACA recipients.  \n158.  Rescinding DACA will harm the ability of Oregon colleges and universities, \nincluding public universities, to satisfy their educational missions and prepare Oregon residents \nfor  the  workforce.  Oregon’s  colleges  and  universities  also  prepare  students  to  be  the  next \ngeneration of political, civic, and private and public sector leaders.  \n159.  Oregon invests in its educational mission by also investing in its DACA recipient \nstudents.  It does this by, among other things, offering free comprehensive K-12 education to \nundocumented students, and, upon graduation from an Oregon high school or GED program, \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 30 of 58 PageID #: 30\noffering tuition equity (in-state tuition benefits) and access to state financial aid to Oregon \nresidents who are undocumented, including DACA recipients.   \n160.  Portland State University, based in Portland, Oregon, is a public university that \nenrolls and in some cases employs DACA recipients. Losing the ability to employ these DACA \nrecipients means the university loses economic and training investments. The potential loss of \nthose enrolled means a loss of graduates and future alumni who would invest their time and talents \nin the university and community. Other Oregon colleges and universities, including community \ncolleges, also enroll and in some cases employ DACA recipients. \n161.  Eastern Oregon University, based in La Grande, Oregon, and Western Oregon \nUniversity, based in Monmouth, Oregon, are public universities that enroll DACA recipients, and \nare partner universities with USDream project, which provides scholarships to DACA students \nfrom non-tuition equity states to come to Oregon partner universities to study.   \n162.  The rescission of DACA will likely cause some DACA recipients to leave Oregon \ncolleges and universities, or take longer to complete their course of study because they can no \nlonger work to support their educational expenses that are not covered by financial aid.  The cost \nof a college education may make little sense for students unable to work following graduation, \nwhich may discourage students from enrolling or continuing with their course of study. In one \nstudy, more than 90% of the respondent DACA grantees who were in school agreed that because \nof DACA, they pursued educational opportunities that they previously could not. See Ex. 22 \n(Center for American Progress, New Study of DACA Beneficiaries Shows Positive Economic and \nEducational Outcomes, Oct. 18, 2016). These harms damage the educational mission of Oregon’s \ninstitutions of higher education and affect their tuition revenues.  It also undermines Oregon’s \ninvestment in and efforts to develop a well-educated workforce that can contribute to the State’s \neconomy and competitiveness. The harm is for years to come, not just the short-term. \n163.  Rescinding DACA also will hurt the Oregon economy. Stripping DACA recipients \nof the ability to work legally will cause many to lose their jobs, resulting, among other things, in \nless tax revenue for the state. According to one estimate, DACA-eligible residents contribute \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 31 of 58 PageID #: 31\napproximately  $20  million  in  state  and  local  taxes  in  Oregon,  and  the  State  would  lose \napproximately $11 million in state and local tax revenue if the DACA program were rescinded. \nSee Ex. 54 (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, State and Local Contributions of Young \nUndocumented Immigrants, Apr. 2017). It also has been estimated that removing DACA workers \nwould cost Oregon more than $600 million in GDP. See Ex. 53 (Center for American Progress, A \nNew Threat to DACA Could Cost State Billions of Dollars¸ Jul. 21, 2017). Research shows that \nDACA recipients average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers and are able to \nbetter participate in our economy, for example by purchasing homes and starting businesses that \nare taxed by our state and local authorities. See Ex. 22. \n164.  In sum, Defendants’ actions in rescinding DACA adversely and significantly \naffects  Oregon’s  economy,  residents,  families,  educational  institutions,  state  agencies,  and \nbusinesses. \n \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF PENSYLVANIA \n165.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, represented by and through its Attorney \nGeneral, “the chief law officer of the Commonwealth,” is a sovereign state of the United States of \nAmerica.  PA Const., Art. IV, § 4.1. \n166.  Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn, an early Quaker and advocate of \ndemocracy, immigration and religious freedom and places great value on tolerance, diversity, \nmulticulturalism and an openness to others of different races, religions and nationalities.  \n167.  The  Attorney  General  of  Pennsylvania  files  this  action  because  Defendants’ \nrescission  of  DACA,  has  caused  injuries  to  its  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  proprietary \ninterests.  The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also has standing under \nthe  parens  patriae  doctrine  to  protect  the  people,  schools,  institutions  and  economy  of \nPennsylvania including quasi-sovereign interests such as the general health, comfort and welfare \nof the citizens of Pennsylvania.  In filing this action, the Attorney General seeks to redress the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 32 of 58 PageID #: 32\ninjuries to the interests described herein, which are separate from the narrow interests of particular \nindividuals. \n168.  Pennsylvania’s  laws  reflect  its  commitment  to  its  values  of  diversity, \nmulticulturalism  and  openness  to  others  of  different  races  and  nationalities.    For  example, \nPennsylvania’s  Human  Relations  Act  recognizes  that  an  individual’s  opportunity  to  obtain \nemployment, public accommodation, housing accommodation and commercial property without \ndiscrimination on the basis of “race, color, familial status, … ancestry [and] national origin” is a \n“civil right” that is “enforceable” under Pennsylvania law.  43 P.S. § 953 (“The opportunity for an \nindividual to obtain employment for which he is qualified, and to obtain all the accommodations, \nadvantages,  facilities  and  privileges  of  any  public  accommodation  and  of  any  housing \naccommodation and commercial property without discrimination because of race, color, familial \nstatus, religious creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, age, sex, national origin, the use of a guide \nor support animal because of the blindness, deafness or physical handicap of the user or because \nthe user is a handler or trainer of support or guide animals is hereby recognized as and declared to \nbe a civil right which shall be enforceable as set forth in this act.”).  See also 43 P.S. § 955. \n169.  Pennsylvania is home to approximately 15,000 DACA-eligible immigrants. See Ex. \n54. \n170.  As of March 31, 2017, initial DACA applications had been accepted for 5,889 \nyoung immigrants living in Pennsylvania. See Ex. 1.  \n171.  Of those Pennsylvania DACA recipients, it is estimated that 5,123 are working in \nPennsylvania where they generate approximately $357,080,795 of economic activity annually.  \nSee Ex. 53. \n172.  In  connection  with  this  significant  Pennsylvania  economic  activity,  workers \nenrolled in DACA generate an estimated $20.7 million in state and local taxes in Pennsylvania \neach year. See Ex. 54. \n173.  Among other items set forth herein, Pennsylvania is particularly concerned that, \nbased on the DHS’ Memorandum rescinding DACA, immigrants who shared their sensitive, \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 33 of 58 PageID #: 33\npersonal information with the federal government in reliance on DACA’s promise that their \ninformation would not be used against them in immigration enforcement proceedings will now \nface exactly that – a federal government that lured these young people to share their personal \ninformation and will now break its promise and use that information to deport them.  The DHS \nMemorandum,  notably,  fails  to  honor  the  federal  government’s  promise  to  these  important \neconomic contributors to Pennsylvania. And Defendants’ actions will cause Pennsylvania to lose \nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity – and tens of millions of state and local tax \ndollars – annually.   \n \n \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF RHODE ISLAND \n174.  The State of Rhode Island, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \nsovereign state of the United States of America. Rhode Island is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions \nand has standing to bring this action because of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by \nDefendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, \nquasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n175.  The State of Rhode Island has prohibited practices that discriminate against any of \nits inhabitants because of race, color, or national origin. R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1.  \n176.  Rhode Island’s interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its \nresidents, including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a \nquasi-sovereign interest. \n177.  Rhode Island also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from \nthe benefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n178.  Rhode Island’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of Rhode Island’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 34 of 58 PageID #: 34\n179.  According to the latest American Community Survey, Rhode Island is home to \nmore than 140,000 foreign-born residents. See Ex. 79 (Rhode Island State Center, Census Data \nBulletin, March 2014). \n180.  The  Migration  Policy  Institute  estimates  that  there  are  5,000  DACA-eligible \nresidents in Rhode Island. See Ex. 80 (Migration Policy Institute, State/County DACA Estimates). \n181.  According  to  USCIS,  1,229  initial  DACA  applications  and  1,733  renewal \napplications from Rhode Island have been approved through the second quarter of 2017. See Ex. \n1.  \n182.  The market for highly skilled workers and employees is extremely competitive. \nRescinding the work authorization of DACA grantees will inhibit Rhode Island companies’ ability \nto adequately staff their organizations, develop their workforces, and recruit talent. If recruiting \nefforts are less successful, these companies’ abilities to develop and deliver successful products \nand services may be adversely affected. \n183.  Rhode Island expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage DACA recipients. \nRhode Island wastes that time and money, and loses the value of employee labor, if employees are \nnot able to continue to work due to DACA’s rescission. \n184.  DACA recipients make significant contributions to state and local taxes. DACA \nrecipients average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers and are able to better \nparticipate in our economy, for example by purchasing homes and cars that are taxed by our state \nand local authorities. According to ITEP, the State of Rhode Island alone will lose $2.6 million in \nstate and local taxes if DACA protections are lost. See Ex.  54. \n185.  According to the Center for American Progress, Rhode Island will lose more than \n$61 million in annual GDP as a result of losing DACA workers. See Ex. 53. \n186.  In  sum,  the  DHS  Memorandum’s  rescission  of  DACA  affects  Rhode  Island \nresidents, families, and businesses, as well as harms Rhode Island’s proprietary interests. \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 35 of 58 PageID #: 35\nPLAINTIFF STATE OF VERMONT \n187.  The State of Vermont, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \nsovereign state of the United States of America.  Vermont is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and \nhas standing to bring this action because of the injury to its sovereignty as a state caused by \nDefendants’ rescission of DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, \nquasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n188.  The Attorney General is empowered to advance Vermont’s strong and important \npublic  policy  against  unlawful  discrimination.  The  Common  Benefits  Clause  of  Vermont’s \nConstitution provides that government “is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, \nprotection, and security of the people, nation, or community,” not for the “advantage of any single \nperson, family, or set of persons, who are a part only of that community.”  Vt. Const., ch. I, art 7. \n189.  The State of Vermont has prohibited practices that discriminate against any of its \ninhabitants because of race, color, national origin, ancestry, and place of birth.  9 V.S.A. § 4502; \n21 V.S.A. § 495.   \n190.  Vermont’s interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its residents, \nincluding protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, is a quasi-\nsovereign interest. \n191.  Vermont also has an interest in ensuring that its residents are not excluded from the \nbenefits that flow from participation in the federal system, including the rights and privileges \nprovided by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n192.  Vermont’s interest in preventing and remedying injuries to the public’s health, \nsafety, and well-being extends to all of Vermont’s residents, including individuals who suffer \nindirect injuries and members of the general public. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 36 of 58 PageID #: 36\n193.  According to the latest American Community Survey, Vermont is home to over \n26,000 foreign-born residents.1 \n194.  According to United States Citizen and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), 42 initial \nDACA applications and 162 renewal applications from Vermont have been approved through the \nsecond quarter of 2017. Ex. 1 (USCIS Data).  \n195.  One expert estimates that of that total, at least 37 DACA grantees currently work \nin Vermont’s economy. Ex. 53 (Nicole Prchal Svajlenka, A New Threat to DACA Could Cost \nStates Billions of Dollars, Center for American Progress, July 21, 2017). If DACA is terminated, \nthese grantees will lose their work authorization.  The resulting loss in employment will cause \nsignificant loses in tax revenue and Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”).  Over ten years, Vermont \ncan expect to $2,429,910 in GDP with the loss of DACA. Id. \n196.   The market for highly skilled workers and employees is extremely competitive. \nRescinding the work authorization of DACA recipients will inhibit Vermont companies’ ability to \nadequately staff their organizations, develop their workforces, and recruit talent. If recruiting \nefforts are less successful, these companies’ abilities to develop and deliver successful products \nand services may be adversely affected. \n197.  DACA recipients make significant contributions to state and local taxes. DACA \nrecipients average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers and are able to better \nparticipate in our economy, for example by purchasing homes and cars that are taxed by our state \nand local authorities. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (“ITEP”), the \nState of Vermont alone will lose $48,000 in state and local taxes if DACA protections are lost. See \nEx. 54 (2017 DACA Tax). \n198.  In sum, President Trump’s Executive Order rescinding DACA affects Vermont \nresidents, families, and businesses, as well as harms Vermont’s proprietary interests. \n                                                 \n1 U.S. Census Bureau, Place of birth for the foreign-born population in the United States: Vermont, 2011-\n2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates; American Immigration Council, Fact Sheet: New Americans \nin Vermont (Jan. 1, 2015), available at https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/new-americans-\nvermont. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 37 of 58 PageID #: 37\n \nPLAINTIFF COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA \n199.  The Commonwealth of Virginia has a strong interest in retaining the DACA \nprogram.  USCIS has approved over 12,000 initial applications from DACA grantees since 2012. \nSee Ex. 1.   \n200.  If DACA is terminated, these grantees will lose their work authorization.  The \nresulting loss in employment will cause significant loses in tax revenue and Gross Domestic \nProduct (“GDP”).  Over ten years, Virginia can expect to lose $1.03 billion in tax revenues, and \n$3.68 billion in GDP with the loss of DACA. See Ex. 4, Table 1 (Brannon Decl.). \n201.  Moreover, rescinding DACA would adversely impact Virginia’s public colleges \nand universities.  According to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, over a thousand \nDACA  grantees  attend  Virginia’s  two-year  and  four-year  public  institutions  of  higher \nlearning.  These students would be less likely to continue pursuing their education at those \ninstitutions if there is no viable employment option available to them upon graduation.   \nDEFENDANTS \n202.  Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and authorized the \nissuance of the DHS Memorandum that purports to rescind DACA. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \n203.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \nDACA program. DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government, and is an \nagency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n204.  Defendant USCIS is an Operational and Support Component agency within DHS. \nUSCIS is the sub-agency responsible for administering the DACA program. \n205.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is an Operational \nand Support Component agency within DHS. ICE is responsible for enforcing federal immigration \nlaw, including identifying, apprehending, detaining, and removing non-citizens. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 38 of 58 PageID #: 38\n206.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. She is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nand oversees USCIS and ICE. She is sued in her official capacity. \n207.  Defendant the United States of America includes all government agencies and \ndepartments responsible for the implementation and rescission of the DACA program. \nALLEGATIONS \nEstablishment of the DACA Program. \n208.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \nmemorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”). See Ex.  34 \n(2012 DACA Memorandum). Under DACA, individuals who were brought to the United States \nas children and meet specific criteria may request deferred action for a period of two years, subject \nto renewal.   \n209.  Deferred action is a well-established form of prosecutorial discretion under which \nthe government forbears from taking removal action against an individual for a designated period. \nThe 2012 DACA Memorandum explained that DACA covers “certain young people who were \nbrought to this country as children and know only this country as home” and that the immigration \nlaws are not “designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have \nlived or even speak the language.” Id. at 1-2. \n210.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established that an applicant would be considered \nfor an exercise of prosecutorial discretion only by satisfying each of the following criteria:  \na.  came to the United States under the age of sixteen;  \nb.  had continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding \nthe date of the memorandum and is present in the United States on the date of \nthe memorandum;  \nc.  was currently in school, had graduated from high school, had obtained a general \neducation development certificate, or was an honorably discharged veteran of \nthe Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 39 of 58 PageID #: 39\nd.  had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, \nmultiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security \nor public safety; and  \ne.  was not above the age of thirty. \nId. at 1.  \n211.  USCIS  described  DACA  as  follows:  “Deferred  action  is  a  discretionary \ndetermination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For \npurposes of future inadmissibility based upon unlawful presence, an individual whose case has \nbeen deferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred action \nis in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in \nthe United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the period \ndeferred action is in effect. However, deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an \nindividual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.” See Ex. \n14, Question 1 (USCIS Help Center, DACA FAQs). \n212.  As the government has recognized, our nation “continue[s] to benefit . . . from the \ncontributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than to \ncontribute to our country and our shared future.” See Ex.  15 (Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles \nJohnson to Rep. Judy Chu, Dec. 30, 2016).  \n \nThe DACA Application Process \n \n213.  USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that “[a]ll individuals who \nbelieve they meet the guidelines . . . may affirmatively request consideration of DACA from \nUSCIS through this process,” and after USCIS receives the applicant’s forms, evidence, supporting \ndocuments and application fee, “USCIS will review them for completeness.” USCIS further \naffirmatively represented to DACA applicants that if it determines that the request is complete, \nUSCIS will send the applicant notices of receipt and for needed appointments, and then review the \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 40 of 58 PageID #: 40\napplications “on an individual, case-by-case basis” and notify applicants of its determination in \nwriting. See Ex. 16 (USCIS Help Center, How do I request consideration of DACA?). \n214.  In order to apply for the DACA program, applicants had to submit extensive \ndocumentation establishing that they meet the eligibility criteria. Applicants had to submit a Form \nI-765 Application for Employment Authorization, and pay a $495 fee. See Ex. 14 at Questions 28-\n41; see also Ex. 17 (USCIS, I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) \n(explaining that the filing fee for a DACA application cannot be waived).   \n215.  DACA applicants had to undergo biometric and biographic background checks. \nWhen  conducting  these  checks,  DHS  reviewed  the  applicant’s  biometric  and  biographic \ninformation “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government \nagencies.” See Ex.  14 at Questions 23. If any information “indicates that [the applicant’s] presence \nin the United States threatens public safety or national security,” the applicant will be ineligible \nfor DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.” Id. at Question 65. \n216.  Once  individuals  were  admitted  into  the  DACA  program,  internal  USCIS \n“Standard Operating Procedures” dictate that, absent an “Egregious Public Safety” issue, DACA \ngrantees  should not be terminated from the program until the government has provided a “Notice \nof Intent to Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[s]” the grounds for the termination.” See Ex. \n18 at 132, Appendix I (DHS, National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals, Apr. 4, 2013). DHS policy further provided that the grantees of such notice \nshould be afforded 33 days to “file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in the Notice \nof Intent to Terminate” prior to termination of participation in the DACA program. Id. \n217.  At the expiration of their two-year DACA term, grantees could seek renewal. As \nUSCIS has represented, DACA applicants “may be considered for renewal of DACA” if they meet \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 41 of 58 PageID #: 41\nthe guidelines for consideration and meet other criteria which “must be met for consideration of \nDACA renewal.” See Ex. 19 (USCIS Help Center, How will USCIS evaluate my request for \nrenewal of DACA?). \nBenefits Provided Under the DACA Program \n218.  DACA confers numerous benefits on DACA grantees. Notably, DACA grantees \nare granted the right not to be arrested or detained based solely on their immigration status during \nthe time period their deferred action is in effect. See Ex. 14, Question 9. \n219.  DACA grantees also are granted eligibility for work authorization. As USCIS has \nexplained,  “an  individual  whose  case  has  been  deferred  is  eligible  to  receive  employment \nauthorization for the period of deferred action . . . .’” Id., Question 1.  \n220.  DACA grantees are eligible to receive certain public benefits. These include Social \nSecurity, retirement, and disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as driver’s licenses \nor unemployment insurance. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d). In the State of Washington, \nDACA holders also are eligible for certain state financial aid programs and state-funded food \nassistance. See Wash. Rev. Code § 28B.92.010; Wash. Admin. Code §§ 388-400-0050, 388-424-\n0001, 388-424-0030. In the State of New York, DACA holders are eligible for teaching and \nnursing licenses. See Comm. of Educ. Regs. §§ 59.4; 80-1.3; Ex. 78 (NYS Board of Regents Press \nRelease, Feb. 24, 2016). \n \n221.  DACA enables grantees to secure equal access to numerous other benefits and \nopportunities on which Americans depend, enabling grantees to open bank accounts, obtain credit \ncards, start businesses, purchase homes and cars, and conduct other aspects of daily life that are \notherwise often unavailable for undocumented immigrants. See Ex. 5 (Wong Decl.). \n222.  DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands of young people “to enroll in colleges \nand universities, complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 42 of 58 PageID #: 42\ngive back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs—\nall on the books.” See Ex. 15 (Letter from Sec’y Johnson). \n223.  These positive effects have rippled throughout the States’ economies.  Rescinding \nDACA would not only rip away the life-changing benefits to individual DACA grantees, but would \nalso reverse the benefits to the community at large, including innumerable small businesses, non-\nprofits, and governments.2  \nThe Government’s Assurances That the Information Provided by DACA Applicants Would \nbe Kept Confidential and Not Used for Enforcement \n224.  When the DACA program was first implemented, many eligible young people were \nreluctant to voluntarily disclose information that could help facilitate their removal from the United \nStates. To encourage applications, DHS repeatedly promised applicants that information they \nprovided as part of the DACA application process would “not later be used for immigration \nenforcement purposes.” Ex.  15 (Letter from Sec’y Johnson). \n225.  Moreover, the approval notice granting deferred action under DACA lists only \n“fraud or misrepresentation” in the application process or “[s]ubsequent criminal activity” as \ngrounds for revoking DACA. Ex. 24 (USCIS, DACA Approval Notice). \n226.  The government’s commitment to the DACA program was further communicated \nto young people through its publication entitled “National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)” (the “DACA SOP”). Ex.  18. This document \nsets forth the standards agency applies concerning DACA applications with nearly 150 pages of \nspecific instructions for granting or denying deferred action. \n                                                 \n2 See e.g., Ex. 20 (Ike Brannon, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA, the Cato Institute, Jan. 18, \n2017) (“The deportation of DACA participants would cost the American economy billions of dollars, as well as \nbillions of tax dollars foregone, while doing little to address the true concerns that Americans may have about \nunauthorized immigrants”); Ex. 21 (Tom Wong, et al., DACA Grantees’ Economic and Educational Gains Continue \nto Grow, Center for American Progress,  Aug. 28, 2017) (quoting multiple DACA grantees whose small businesses \nwill suffer or even close if DACA is rescinded); Ex. 22 (Tom Wong et al., New Study of DACA Beneficiaries \nShows Positive Economic and Educational Outcomes, Center for American Progress, Oct. 18, 2016) (study showing \nthat 9 percent of DACA grantees work at non-profits, a significant percentage work in education, and 6 percent \nstarted their own business, including one owner who employs nine people and hopes to continue to grow and “hire \neven more people from the community” [internal brackets and quotation marks omitted]). \n \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 43 of 58 PageID #: 43\n227.  USCIS  affirmatively  represented  to  DACA  applicants  that,  except  in  limited \ncircumstances, “[i]nformation provided in [a DACA request] is protected from disclosure to ICE \nand CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.” Ex. 25 (USCIS Help Center, \nWill the information I share in my request for DACA be used for immigration enforcement \npurposes?). \n228.  USCIS  affirmatively  represented  to  DACA  applicants  that,  except  in  limited \ncircumstances, “[i]f you have submitted request for consideration of DACA and USCIS decides \nnot to defer your case . . . your case will not be referred to ICE for purposes of removal \nproceedings.” Ex. 26 (USCIS Help Center, If USCIS does not exercise deferred action in my case, \nwill I be placed in removal proceedings?). \n229.  In the exceptional circumstances when USCIS refers a DACA applicant to ICE, \nUSCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that “information related to your family \nmembers or guardians that is contained in your request will not be referred to ICE for purposes of \nimmigration enforcement against family members or guardians.” Ex. 27 (USCIS Help Center, If \nmy DACA case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes or if I receive an NTA, \nwill information related to my family members and  guardians also be referred to  ICE for \nimmigration enforcement purposes?). \n230.  USCIS affirmatively represented to employers of DACA applicants that, except in \nlimited circumstances, if they provide their employees \"with information regarding his or her \nemployment to support a request for consideration of DACA . . . . This information will not be \nshared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes.” Ex. 28 (USCIS Help Center, If I \nprovide my employee with information regarding his or her employment to support a request for \nconsideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes \nagainst me and/or my company?). \n231.  The government’s representations that information provided by a DACA recipient \nwould not be used against him or her for later immigration enforcement proceedings were \nunequivocal  and  atypical.  For  example,  the  federal  government  does  not  make  the  same \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 44 of 58 PageID #: 44\nrepresentations for participants in other similar programs, such as Temporary Protected Status. \nThese assurances were key to the success of the DACA initiative. By making repeated, unique, \nand strong representations, the federal government induced persons to rely on those representations \nand apply to become DACA grantees despite the potential risks. \n \nThe  Government’s  Statements  Regarding  Continuity  and  Fair  Treatment  for  DACA \nGrantees \n232.  Numerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced the federal \ngovernment’s promise to provide continuity and fair treatment to DACA grantees, and have \nrecognized that DACA grantees have relied on the government’s representations in applying for \nDACA. For example, in December 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles \nJohnson acknowledged that there are 750,000 DACA grantees who have “relied on the U.S. \ngovernment’s representations” about DACA, and asserted that “representations made by the U.S. \ngovernment, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored.” \nEx.  15. \n233.  On December 8, 2016, then-President-elect Trump stated in an interview with TIME \nmagazine that he would find an accommodation for DACA grantees, stating, “We’re going to work \nsomething out that’s going to make people happy and proud.” He further recognized, “[DACA \ngrantees] got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. \nSome were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because \nthey don’t know what’s going to happen.” Ex. 29 (Michael Scherer, Person of the Year 2016, \nTIME Magazine, Dec. 2016). \n234.  Again, on January 18, 2017, then President-elect Trump promised in an interview \nwith Fox & Friends that he was working on a plan to make DACA grantees “very happy.” He \nfurther stated, “We’re working on a plan right now. And that plan, over the next two to three \nmonths, is going to come out. And it’s a plan that’s going to be very firm, but it’s going to have a \nlot of heart.” Ex. 30 (Francesca Chambers, Trump signals he’s softening on immigration as he says \nhe’s ‘working on a plan’ that will make DREAMers ‘very happy,’  Daily Mail, Jan. 18, 2017). \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 45 of 58 PageID #: 45\n235.  In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the government must \nensure that “the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” DACA grantees, who have “organize[d] \n[their] li[ves] around” the DACA program. Ex. 31 (CNN, Transcript of CNN Town Hall with \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, Jan. 12, 2017).   \n236.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump again stated in an interview with David Muir \nthat “[DACA grantees] shouldn’t be very worried. I do have a big heart.” Ex. 32 (ABC News, \nTranscript of ABC News anchor David Muir interview with Donald Trump, Jan. 25, 2017). \n237.  On  March  29,  2017,  Secretary  Kelly  reaffirmed  that  “DACA  status”  is  a \n“commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person, or the so-called Dreamer.” Ex. \n33 (Ted Hesson & Seung Min Kim, Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration, \nPolitico, Mar. 29, 2017).    \n238.  On April 21, 2017, President Trump confirmed that his Administration’s policy is \nnot to deport DACA grantees, and suggested that they “should rest easy.” Ex. 34 (The Associated \nPress, Transcript of interview with Trump, Apr. 21, 2017). \n \nPresident Trump’s Statements about Mexicans \n239.  Despite these various and repeated promises to DACA grantees made by the federal \ngovernment and by President Trump, including a recognition of DACA’s value and successes, \nPresident Trump has a long history of disparaging Mexicans, who comprise the vast majority of \nDACA grantees.  \n240.  In  announcing  his  presidential  campaign,  then-candidate  Trump  compared \nMexican immigrants to rapists, stating: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their \nbest. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re \nbringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. \nAnd some, I assume, are good people.” Ex. 35 (Washington Post, Transcript of Donald Trump’s \nPresidential Bid Announcement, June 16, 2015). \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 46 of 58 PageID #: 46\n241.  During the first Republican presidential debate, then-candidate Trump again re-\nstated his distaste for immigrants from Mexico: “The Mexican government is much smarter, much \nsharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for \nthem. They don’t want to take care of them.” Ex. 36 (Andrew O’Reilly, At GOP debate, Trump \nsays ‘stupid’ U.S. leaders are being duped by Mexico, Fox News, Aug. 6, 2015. \n242.   Soon after, on August 25, 2015, then-candidate Trump refused to answer questions \nabout immigration from Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-American and the top news anchor at Univision, \na Spanish-language news channels. After sending his bodyguard to physically remove Mr. Ramos, \nthen-candidate Trump derisively told Mr. Ramos to “Go back to Univision.” Ex. 37 (Phillip \nRucker, First, Trump booted Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out of his news conference. Then \nthings got interesting, The Washington Post, Aug. 25, 2015).  \n243.  In May 2016, then-candidate Trump referred to anti-Trump protestors who carried \nthe Mexican flag on Twitter as “criminals” and “thugs.”  Ex. 38 (Donald Trump, The protestors in \nNew Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican Flag, Twitter, May 25, 2016), and Ex. 39 \n(Donald Trump, Many of the thugs that attacked peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were \nillegals, Twitter, June 4, 2016). \n244.  In June 2016, then-candidate Trump impugned the integrity of a federal judge \npresiding over a lawsuit against one of his businesses because the judge is Hispanic. Suggesting \nhis own opinions are anti-Hispanic, then-candidate Trump commented that Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s \nunfavorable rulings “[H]as to do with perhaps that I’m very, very strong on the border. . . Now, he \nis Hispanic, I believe. He is a very hostile judge to me.” Ex. 40 (Jose A.  DelReal and Katie Zezima, \nTrump’s personal, racially tinged attacks on federal judge alarm legal experts, The Washington \nPost, June 1, 2016).   \n245.  In an interview with CBS News on June 5, 2016, then-candidate Trump again \nreiterated his anti-Mexican views, noting that “[Judge Curiel]’s a member of a club or society very \nstrongly, pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias.” Ex. 41 (Transcript of Face the \nNation, CBS News, June 5, 2016). Judge Curiel is a member of is the San Diego Chapter of the \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 47 of 58 PageID #: 47\nLa Raza Lawyers Association. See Ex. 42 (Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Trump supporters’ false claim \nthat Trump U judge is a member of a pro-immigrant group, The Washington Post, June 7, 2016). \n246.  On August 21, 2015, two men urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then beat him \nwith a metal pole. At the police station, they stated “Donald Trump was right; all these illegals \nneed to be deported.” When asked about the incident, then-candidate Trump failed to condemn the \nmen, instead stating that they were “passionate.” Specifically, Trump stated, “[i]t would be a \nshame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country \nand they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.” Ex. 43 (Adrian Walker, \n‘Passionate’ Trump fans behind homeless man’s beating?, The Boston Globe, Aug. 21, 2015). \n247.  In October 2016, during a presidential debate,then-candidate Trump responded to \na question about immigration by stating: “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get \nthem out.” Ex. 44 (Katie Zezima, Trump on immigration: There are ‘bad hombres’ in the United \nStates, The Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2017). \n248.  On January 27, 2017, newly-inaugurated President Trump and Mexico’s President \nPeña Nieto discussed President Trump’s proposal for a border wall over the phone. During that \ntranscribed conversation, President Trump again referred to “hombres” stating: “You have some \npretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with \nthat big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking \nthem out.” Ex. 45 (Greg Miller et. al., Full Transcripts of Trump’s Calls with Mexico and \nAustralia, The Washington Post, Aug. 3, 2017).  \n249.  On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff \nJoe Arpaio, who was to be sentenced for criminal contempt for failing to comply with a federal \njudge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos. See Ex. 46 (Julie Hirschfield Davis and Maggie \nHaberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio, Who Became Face of Crackdown on Illegal Immigration, \nThe N.Y. Times, Aug. 25, 2017).  \n250.  Arpaio had been detaining people ostensibly because they had violated the law. But \nin practice, his office detained huge numbers of individuals solely because they looked Latino, \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 48 of 58 PageID #: 48\nwithout any reasonable suspicion of illegal conduct. See generally Melendres v. Arpaio, Findings \nof Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:07-cv-02513-GMS, ECF Doc. No.579 (D. Az. May 24, 2013). \nAfter  a  federal  court  enjoined  that  practice  in  2011,  Arpaio  continued  his  unlawful  and \ndiscriminatory practices unabated, “announc[ing] to the world and to his subordinates that he was \ngoing to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise.” United States v. Arpaio, \nFindings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 2:16-cr-01012-SRB, ECF Doc. No. 210 at 13 (D. Az. July \n31, 2017). On July 31, 2017, a federal court held Arpaio in criminal contempt, holding that he had \nwillfully acted in “flagrant disregard” of the injunction. Id. \n251.  Before issuing the pardon, President Trump asked, “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for \ndoing his job?” Ex. 46. After issuing the pardon, President Trump sent a tweet calling Mr. Arpaio \n“an American patriot.” Id. \n252.  As President Trump’s statements about Mexico and those with Mexican roots \nshow, the President has demonstrated a willingness to disparage Mexicans in a misguided attempt \nto secure support from his constituency, even when such impulses are impermissible motives for \ndirecting governmental policy.   \nTrump Administration’s Threatening Statements about Deporting Immigrants \n253.  On June 13, 2017, Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan testified in front of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, stating as to “every \nimmigrant in the country without papers,” that they “should be uncomfortable. You should look \nover your shoulder. And you need to be worried.” Hearing on the ICE and CBP F.Y. 2018 Budget \nBefore the Subcomm. on Homeland Security of the H. Comm. on Appropriations, 115th Cong. \n(2017) 2017 WLNR 18737622. CNN reported that Homan “doubled down” on these statements \nin an interview later that week, stating that “Trump and his administration have made clear that \nany undocumented immigrant could be arrested and face deportation proceedings at any time, \nunless they have current and valid protection under DACA.” Ex. 48 (Tal Kopan, ICE Director: \nUndocumented immigrants ‘should be afraid,’ CNN, June 6, 2017). \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 49 of 58 PageID #: 49\n254.  On April 19, 2017, United States Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions stated in \nan interview on Fox News’ “Happening Now,” program—in response to a question regarding the \ndeportation of a DACA recipient—that “[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being \ndeported, so people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not \nsubject to being deported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t promise people who are here unlawfully \nthat they aren’t going to be deported.”  Ex. 49 (Adam Shaw, Sessions defends immigration policies \nafter reported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News, Apr. 19, 2017).  \n \nPresident Trump Rescinds DACA in Response to the Litigation Threats of a State Found To \nHave Discriminated Against Latinos/Hispanics Nine Times Since 2012  \n255.  On June 29, 2017, the Attorneys General of ten states, led by the State of Texas, \nsent U.S. Attorney General Sessions a letter threatening to add claims to litigation currently \npending in the Southern District of Texas “to challenge both the DACA program and the remaining \nexpanded DACA permits,” if the Executive Branch did not agree to end the DACA program by \nSeptember 5, 2017.  \n256.  The  demand  that  President  Trump  eliminate  DACA  is  part  of  a  history  of \nintentional discrimination against Latinos/Hispanics by the State of Texas. \n257.  Over the preceding decade, federal courts have repeatedly found the State of Texas \nliable for engaging in unlawful discrimination based on race and/or national origin. \n258.  For example, in Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133, 161 (D.D.C. 2012), \nthree federal judges blocked a Congressional and State House redistricting plan after finding that \nit “was enacted with discriminatory purpose.”  \n259.  The litigation eventually culminated in a ruling by a three-judge panel on August \n15, 2017 finding, again, that the 2010 congressional districts had been created with “racially \ndiscriminatory intent” against Latinos and African American voters. Perez v. Abbott, SA-11-CV-\n360, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129982, at *55 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 50 of 58 PageID #: 50\n260.  On  October  9,  2014,  in  separate  litigation  challenging  a  state  voter  photo \nidentification (“ID”) law, a Texas federal district court judge found that the provision had been \n“imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and “constitute[d] an unconstitutional \npoll tax.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 633 (S.D. Tex. 2014).  \n261.  On remand from the Fifth Circuit, a federal district court concluded that the 2011 \nLegislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters by requiring presentation of a photo \nID when casting their ballots. Veasey v. Abbott, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54253, at *14-18 (S.D. \nTex. Apr. 10, 2017). \n262.  DHS issued the DHS Memorandum rescinding DACA on September 5, 2017, in \ndirect response to the threats of the State of Texas and the other ten states, fulfilling the demand \nof a State marked with a history of racial discrimination.  \nPresident Trump Backtracks on His Promise and Rescinds DACA \n263.  Despite its repeated assurances, the federal government announced that the DACA \nprogram will be rescinded and that the government will immediately cease accepting applications \nunder DACA. The federal government will process pending applications on a case-by-case basis. \nSee Ex. 74 (DHS, Memorandum Rescinding DACA, September 5, 2017). The federal government \nwill only issue renewals for recipients whose permits expire before March 5, 2018, provided they \napply for renewal by October 5, 2018. Id. The DHS Memorandum further specifies that the \ngovernment will not approve any new or pending applications for advanced parole. Id. \n264.  In issuing the DHS Memorandum rescinding DACA, the federal government \nmisleadingly  claimed  that  DACA  was  unconstitutional,  despite  no  court  making  that \ndetermination.  See Ex. 75 (DOJ, Attorney General Sessions Remarks on DACA, September 5, \n2017). \n265.  As a result of the DHS Memorandum, after the expiration of DACA grantees’ \nterms, the grantees will immediately face the risk of losing their employment, as well as vital \nbenefits, such as social security cards, driver licenses, financial aid, disability and health benefits, \namong others. They also may lose their homes and communities if the program is allowed to \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 51 of 58 PageID #: 51\nexpire: an internal White House memo reported on by CNN stated that DHS now is urging DACA \nrecipients “to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States” when their DACA \nterms end. Ex. 88 (Tal Kopan & Jim Acosta, Admin Memo: DACA recipients should prepare for \ndeparture from the United States, CNN, Sept. 5, 2017).    \n266.  President Trump also has taken affirmative steps to reduce the privacy protections \napplicable to DACA data. In January 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing \nall agencies, including DHS, to “ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not \nUnited States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act \nregarding personally identifiable information.” Ex. 76 (Executive Order 13768, “Enhancing Public \nSafety in the Interior of the United States,” Jan. 25, 2017). DHS has confirmed that its new privacy \npolicy, adopted in response to the Executive Order, “permits the sharing of information about \nimmigrants and non-immigrants with federal, state, and local law enforcement.” Ex. 51 (DHS, \nPrivacy Policy 2017-01 Questions & Answers, Apr. 27, 2017). \n267.  The DHS Memorandum provides no assurance to DACA grantees, or direction to \nUSCIS and ICE, that information contained in DACA applications or renewal requests cannot be \nused for the purpose of future immigration enforcement proceedings.  \n268.  To the contrary, DHS posted public guidance about the impact of the rescission on \nthe same day that the DHS Memorandum was issued, expressly declining to give concrete \nassurances about how it would use the information provided by DACA applicants. DHS states that \nalthough  it  generally  will  not  “proactively”  use  information  obtained  through  DACA  for \nenforcement, it reserves the right to change that policy “at any time without notice” and that the \npolicy “may not be relied upon” by any party. Ex. 89 (DHS, Frequently Asked Questions: \nRescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Sept. 5, 2017). DACA grantees thus \nimmediately face the risk that information they provided to the federal government could be used \nagainst them at any time, without notice, for purposes of immigration enforcement, including \ndetention or deportation. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 52 of 58 PageID #: 52\n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection) \n269.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n270.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government \nfrom denying equal protection of the laws.  \n271.  The DHS Memorandum—together with the President’s numerous statements about \nhis intentions towards Mexicans, who comprise the largest population of DACA grantees—target \nindividuals for discriminatory treatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification. \n272.  The DHS Memorandum was motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory motive \nand/or a desire to harm a particular group. \n273.  The discriminatory terms and application of the DHS Memorandum cannot be \nsufficiently justified by federal interests. \n274.  Through  their  actions  above,  Defendants  have  violated  the  equal  protection \nguarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n275.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Fifth Amendment – Due Process – Information Use) \n276.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n277.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that immigration \nenforcement actions taken by the federal government be fundamentally fair. \n278.  Given the federal government’s representations about the allowable uses of \ninformation provided by DACA applicants, a refusal to prohibit the use of information contained \nin DACA applications and renewal requests for purposes of immigration enforcement, including \nidentifying, apprehending, detaining, or deporting non-citizens, is fundamentally unfair. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 53 of 58 PageID #: 53\n279.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the due process guarantee \nof the Fifth Amendment. \n280.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Substantively Arbitrary and Capricious,  \nAbuse of Discretion, Contrary to Constitution or Statute) \n281.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n282.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), prohibits federal \nagency action that is arbitrary, unconstitutional, and contrary to statute. In implementing the \nDHS Memorandum and rescinding DACA with minimal formal guidance, federal agencies have \ntaken unconstitutional and unlawful action, as alleged herein, in violation of the Administrative \nProcedure Act. \n283.  In implementing the DHS Memorandum, federal agencies have acted arbitrarily \nand capriciously, and otherwise not in accordance with law, and have abused their discretion, in \nviolation of the APA. \n284.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States’ residents. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Procedurally Arbitrary and Capricious,  \nNotice and Comment) \n285.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n286.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D), requires that federal agencies conduct \nformal rule making before engaging in action that impacts substantive rights. \n287.   DHS is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n288.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \nunder the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 54 of 58 PageID #: 54\n289.  In implementing the DHS Memorandum, federal agencies have changed the \nsubstantive criteria by which individuals DACA grantees work, live, attend school, obtain credit, \nand travel in the United States. Federal agencies did not follow the procedures required by the \nAPA before taking action impacting these substantive rights. \n290.   With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency rules must go through \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n291.  The Defendants promulgated and relied upon these rules without authority and \nwithout notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation of the APA.  \n292.  The States will be impacted because they have not had the opportunity to \ncomment on the rescission of DACA. \n293.   Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Regulatory Flexibility Act – Failure to Issue Regulatory Flexibility Analyses) \n294.  The States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n295.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), requires federal \nagencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \nfinal versions of those analyses for public comment. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n296.  “Small entities” for purposes of the RFA includes small businesses, small \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions.  5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n297.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \nunder the RFA. 5 U.S.C. § 601(2). \n298.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are likely to \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  5 U.S.C. § \n602(a)(1). \n299.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 55 of 58 PageID #: 55\n300.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \nviolates the RFA and is unlawful. \n301.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n302.  Wherefore, the States pray that the Court: \na.  Declare that the DHS Memorandum rescinding the DACA program is \nunauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates; \nb.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum rescinding the DACA program are procedurally unlawful \nunder the APA; \nc.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum rescinding the DACA program are substantively unlawful \nunder the APA; \nd.  Declare  that  the  actions  that  DHS  has  taken  to  implement  the  DHS \nMemorandum rescinding the DACA program are unlawful under the RFA; \ne.  Enjoin Defendants from rescinding the DACA program, pending further \norders from this Court; \nf.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  using  information  obtained  in  any  DACA \napplication or renewal request to identify, apprehend, detain, or deport any \nDACA applicant or member of any DACA applicant’s family, or take any \naction against a DACA applicant’s current or former employer; and \ng.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n \n \n \nDATED: September 6, 2017 \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-05228   Document 1   Filed 09/06/17   Page 56 of 58 PageID #: 56\n \n  ERIC T.

UWD’s primary purpose is to advocate for the dignity and fair \ntreatment of immigrant youth and their families, regardless of their immigration status.  Many \nUWD  members  are  beneficiaries  of  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  initiative \nannounced on June 15, 2012.  Because the government action in this case seeks to undo the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals’ protections — protections that have formed the basis \nfor the most consequential life decisions of hundreds of thousands of immigrant youth — UWD \nhas a substantial interest in the proper resolution of the issues presented in this case. \nINTRODUCTION \nWhen  the  United  States  government  established  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood \nArrivals (“DACA”) program in 2012, it made a promise to more than a million undocumented \nyoung people:  if they applied for and met the program’s eligibility criteria, they could rest \nassured that they would not be subject to governmental efforts to upend their lives by uprooting \nthem from the United States.  The government promised these immigrants they would not face \nremoval proceedings for a renewable two-year period.  But in practice, the program — which \nreflected the “low priority” associated with the removal of “certain young people who were \nbrought to this country as children and know only this country as home” — did more than \nguarantee  enrollees  deferred  action.    Memorandum  from  Janet  Napolitano,  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion With Respect to Individuals Who Came \nto the United States as Children (June 15, 2012).  DACA allowed its recipients to obtain work \n                                                 \n1  Counsel for all parties have consented to the filing of this brief.    \n \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 6364\nauthorization, a Social Security number and, in many states, driver’s licenses and in-state tuition \nat public universities.  DACA enabled recipients to open bank accounts, apply for credit cards, \nbuy  homes  and  cars, and  conduct  other  aspects  of  daily  life  that  are  often  impossible  for \nundocumented  immigrants.  DACA  thus  enabled  its  recipients  to  fully  participate  in  their \ncommunities and local economies. \nUnited We Dream submits this amicus brief in support of the Plaintiffs in the above-\ncaptioned  actions,  who  challenge  the  government’s  unlawful  efforts  to  rescind  the  DACA \nprogram.  Our goal is not to reiterate Plaintiffs’ legal arguments, but rather to highlight the \nenormous stakes of these related cases for hundreds of thousands of individuals across the United \nStates.  In particular, this brief provides a glimpse into the lives of the countless young men and \nwomen who placed their trust in, and organized their lives around, DACA.  With the sample of \nstories below, UWD hopes to illustrate how, from their diverse origins spanning the globe — \nincluding India, the Philippines, China, and Mexico — the DACA recipients discussed are now \nfully part of the fabric of America.  As a result, the government’s rescission of this program that \nhas given hope to so many threatens to cause massive disruption to these individuals, their \nfamilies, and their local communities — communities that extend well beyond recipients of the \nDACA program.  Against this backdrop, UWD respectfully requests that the Court grant the \nPlaintiffs’ motions to enjoin the government’s rescission and deny the governments’ motions to \ndismiss these cases.    \nARGUMENT \nThrough  DACA,  thousands  of  young  immigrant  adults  can  give  back  to  their \ncommunities.    DACA  recipients  become  teachers,  community  leaders,  and  small  business \nowners.  They provide for themselves and their families, support their friends, and are closely \nknit into the fabric of the lives of those around them.  The government’s attempt to arbitrarily \n2 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6365\nand abruptly undo DACA protections for these individuals causes grave harm not only to DACA \nrecipients, but also to their families and communities at large. \nA.  DACA Recipients Are Integral to The Lives and Livelihood of Their Families \nWith the greater job opportunities that come with work authorizations, DACA recipients \nare better able to shoulder the financial burden for themselves and their families.  Indeed, over 60 \npercent of surveyed DACA recipients reported that, as a result of obtaining work authorization \nthrough DACA, they could make enough money to financially support their family.  Tom K. \nWong et al., Results of Tom K. Wong, United We Dream, National Immigration Law Center, and \nCenter for American Progress National Survey, at 2 (Oct. 2016).2 \nBut work authorization is not the only benefit that makes DACA so important to family \nlife.  A driver’s license — which most Americans take for granted — is a prized commodity to \nan undocumented household.  In the case of V.D., for example, the driver’s license he obtained \nas a result of DACA allowed him to drive his father to and from the hospital for doctor \nappointments after a serious heart attack, as well as to take care of his disabled younger sister.  \nDACA has also provided V.D. the financial means to take care of his family.  V.D., who studies \ncomputer science at the University of Illinois, uses the savings from his summer technology jobs \nto both pay for his tuition and help support his family. \nLike V.D., P.Z. is also deeply committed to taking care of his family — and DACA \nprovided him with the initial opportunity to do so.  With undocumented parents suffering from \nan  array  of  health  problems,  P.Z.’s  responsibility  was  a  heavy  one,  especially  as  an \nundocumented immigrant.  But thanks to DACA, P.Z. got a job at Twitter, which allows him to \nprovide his parents health insurance so they can receive the care they need.  And, to be able to \n                                                 \n2  Available at https://cdn.americanprogressaction.org/content/uploads/2016/10/. \n3 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 6366\nhelp his parents even more, P.Z. is saving money to help them move close to him in San \nFrancisco. \nThe benefits DACA provides to families are not limited to the families of V.D., P.Z., or \nthe other young immigrants identified in this brief.  Hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients \nbenefit from DACA, from having work authorization to accessing employer-provided health \ninsurance to providing financially for their families every day.  DACA recipients help relieve \ntheir families from the stress of ordinary daily tasks that most U.S. citizens and other authorized \nimmigrants need not think twice about.  From picking up children at school to taking relatives to \nthe doctor to paying the cable bill, young immigrants who receive DACA status can provide \nconstant, stable support for their families.  The government now threatens to undermine the \nfoundations of thousands of families across the United States. \nB.  DACA Recipients Contribute to Their Local Communities \nDACA offers thousands of immigrants the chance to succeed in their chosen careers and \ncontribute to their communities.  Young entrepreneurs like D.A., for example, rely on DACA to \ncreate and innovate.  After the government granted D.A. DACA status, she was able to obtain \nhigher-paying jobs, which allowed her to save money and eventually start her own business.  \nWith a business partner, D.A. bought a landscaping company and hired two employees to help \nher meet demand.  In addition, to maximize the potential of the new venture, D.A. also enrolled \nin classes on small business management at the local community college.  As D.A.’s company \ncontinues to grow and prosper, its success and impact on the community will be closely entwined \nwith the continuation of DACA. \nFor R.P., DACA provided the opportunity and confidence to become a leader in his local \ncommunity.  A Filipino immigrant who came to the United States when he was one year old, \n4 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 6367\nR.P. has lived in the United States almost his entire life.  But only after receiving DACA status \ncould he truly contribute to his larger community in Georgia.  Because of DACA, R.P. was \noffered and accepted a job with a non-profit group assisting Asian immigrants and refugees.  \nAnd with the driver’s license R.P. was able to obtain as a result of DACA, he is finally able to \ntravel freely and board a plane, a simple privilege otherwise reserved for those with valid \ngovernment identification.  The trips R.P. takes are not just for vacation.  R.P. recently travelled \nto a Christian leadership conference where he could further develop skills necessary to growing \nas a leader in his local community.  Without DACA, R.P.’s ability to openly and deeply involve \nhimself in his community would be dramatically limited. \nIn the Arkansas hospital where he works, the people who meet L.A. do not know him as a \nformerly undocumented Mexican immigrant who now enjoys the benefits of DACA; they know \nhim as their nurse.  But L.A.’s story, and the integral role he plays in the lives of his patients in \nthe hospital’s cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit, would not have been possible without DACA.  \nIn 2010, while L.A. was still a nursing student, the State of Arkansas passed a law making it \nimpossible for any individual to obtain a nursing license without a Social Security card.  For \nL.A., who came to the United States at age seven and lacked formal authorization or lawful \nstatus, that requirement was an insurmountable obstacle.  Everything changed in 2013, when the \ngovernment granted L.A. deferred action under DACA.  As a result, L.A. obtained a Social \nSecurity number, received his nursing license, and soon thereafter, was offered a position as a \nnurse in the cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit.  Because of DACA, L.A. was able to fulfill his \ndream of being able to provide medical care to his community. \nD.R., a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, has \na similar dream.  As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, D.R. worked 30 \n5 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 6368\nhours per week as a waitress to support herself through school.  A talented student, D.R. was a \ndouble major in Integrative Biology and Sociology who graduated from Berkeley with a 3.6 \nGPA and until DACA, she was undocumented.  D.R.’s ability to complete a medical residency \nand be employed as a doctor depends on the work authorization she has because of DACA.  The \nprogram has allowed D.R. to pursue a goal that would otherwise have been unattainable. \nDACA recipients have served their communities in a wide range of endeavors.  J.S. \narrived in the United States as an 11-year-old to pick grapes in the Central Valley of California.  \nAlthough he arrived in California with only a third-grade education and spoke no English (and \nlimited  Spanish),  J.S.  applied  himself  scholastically,  successfully  taking  English  Language \nDevelopment classes by the time he was a high school junior.  Because he lacked a Social \nSecurity  number,  J.S.  was  unable  to  apply  to  many  colleges  and  for  many  scholarships.  \nNevertheless, J.S. worked three jobs to pay his way through community college, and eventually \ncompleted his Bachelor’s degree.  Immediately after being granted DACA status and work \nauthorization, J.S. — who comes from a family of indigenous Mexican origin that speaks \nZapotec — used his work authorization to serve in state and federal courts as the nation’s only \ncourt interpreter in the Zapotec dialect.  In this capacity, he has traveled across California and \nNew  Mexico  to  ensure  that  Zapotec-speaking  defendants  are  able  to  understand  the  legal \nproceedings in which they are involved.  Without J.S.’s unique language skills to overcome \nlinguistic  obstacles,  courts  would  face  further  delays  —  and  immigration  detainees  longer \ndetentions. \nJust as DACA enabled Zapotec-speaking defendants access to a fluent court interpreter, \nthe program has also given students at an Austin, Texas high school the guidance of a valuable \nteacher and mentor.  A.Z. — a high-school salutatorian who graduated from the University of \n6 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 6369\nTexas on a full scholarship — teaches Spanish in the Austin Independent School District.  And \nfor A.Z., teaching is a family affair.  When she is not in her classroom, she works with her older \nbrothers, also DACA recipients, as they finish their teaching degrees at the University of Texas.  \nBecause of DACA, both A.Z. and her brothers are able to play an important part in the lives of \nhundreds of students. \nLike the young immigrants described above, DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands \nof previously undocumented individuals to improve their lives and also become integral parts of \ntheir communities.  According to one survey, after receiving DACA status, 42.5 percent of \nDACA recipients got their first job.  Wong et al., supra at 7.  About 61 percent pursued \neducational opportunities previously unavailable to them.  Id. at 3.  Indeed, 55 percent of DACA \nrecipients surveyed are pursuing undergraduate degrees.  Id. at 8.  And 12 percent bought a \nhome, 54 percent bought a car, and 14 percent paid off some or all their student loans.  Id. at 2.  \nFor these individuals, DACA has opened a world of financial independence and opportunity that \nwas previously unavailable. \nC.  DACA Recipients Are Deeply Ingrained in the American Fabric \nThe  individuals  described  above  are  representative  of  DACA  recipients  across  the \ncountry.  Indeed, as of 2016, all fifty states, as well as the District of Columbia and several \nterritories, were home to at least one of the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients.  See infra note 3.  \nBecause of DACA, these individuals — who were brought to the United States at a young age \nfrom countries across the world3 —  have access to better jobs, better education, and more stable \nfinancial positions. \n                                                 \n3  To date, DACA recipients are originally from over 20 countries, including Mexico, Poland, South Korea, and \nIndia.

Wong et al., supra at 7.  They have \nincreased their hourly wages by an average of nearly one-third, and pay taxes.  Five percent of \nDACA recipients surveyed had started their own business.  Id. at 2, 3.  Over 50 percent applied \nfor and received their first credit card, and nearly 50 percent opened a bank account.  Id. at 3. \nWithout a doubt, DACA offers greater access to higher education.  For example, DACA \nenables students to enroll in public colleges and universities in states like Alabama and South \nCarolina, which undocumented students are otherwise barred from attending, see Ala. Code \n§ 31-13-8; S.C. Code Ann. § 59-101-430, and to apply for in-state tuition in Virginia, see Zenen \nJaimes Pérez, How DACA Has Improved the Lives of Undocumented Young People, Center for \nAmerican Progress, at 4 (Nov. 19, 2014), available at http://ampr.gs/1O7iTHA.  In addition, \nseveral states — including Texas, California, and New York — allow undocumented immigrants \nand DACA recipients to attend public colleges and universities at in-state or reduced tuition rates \nand to receive state and institutional financial assistance so long as they meet certain criteria.  Id.  \nAlthough they remain ineligible for financial aid in many states and under federal programs, \nDACA recipients can fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which schools use to \ndetermine financial need and eligibility for scholarships and institutional financial aid. \n   \n8 \n\n \nCase 1:17-cv-05228-NGG-JO   Document 120   Filed 12/20/17   Page 12 of 12 PageID #: 6371\nCONCLUSION \nAs  these  stories  demonstrate,  the  elimination  of  DACA  would  disrupt  the  lives  of \nindividuals, families, and whole communities, all of whom have grown to rely on that program in \norganizing their daily lives.  The rescission of DACA would remove shopkeepers from their \nbusinesses; doctors and nurses from their hospitals; teachers from their classrooms; children \nfrom their parents’ homes; and young men and women who have done nothing wrong from the \nonly country they have ever known.  Understanding and even expecting that DACA recipients \nwould assume these roles in their families and their communities, the government created the \nDACA program and made basic commitments of procedural fairness to its recipients.  For the \ngovernment to break its promise now would tear apart the lives of these young individuals — as \nwell as the fabric of families and entire communities that have been built upon the government’s \npromise.   \nTaking these considerations into account, UWD respectfully requests that the Court grant \nthe  Plaintiffs’  motions  for  a  preliminary  injunction  and  deny  the  government’s  motions  to \ndismiss in these related cases.   \nDated: December 20, 2017         Respectfully submitted, \n \nBy /s/ Peter Karanjia   \n \nPeter Karanjia \nGeoffrey S.
