    "summary": "<p>In June 2017, in response to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> lawsuit </a>filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the federal government released eighteen previously classified opinions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). One of the opinions declassified involved this case.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1881a, permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008]</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2012, the government filed an Ex Parte Submission of [Redacted] and Related Procedures, Ex Parte Submission of [Redacted], and Request for an Order Approving [Redacted]. On August 30, 2013, FISC Judge Reggie B. Walton approved the government's targeting and minimization procedures. The government's submissions were accompanied by two sets of targeting procedures, for use by the NSA and FBI, and four sets of minimization procedures, for use by the NSA, FBI, CIA, and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).</p>\r\n<p>Although Judge Walton's analysis of the NSA and FBI's targeting procedures are heavily redacted, he found that both procedures were \"reasonably designed\" to target persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States and to prevent intentional acquisition of any communications where the sender and recipients are located in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Walton found that the four sets of minimization procedures by the NSA, FBI, CIA, and NCTC were all sufficiently similar, if not identical, to the 2012 certifications and that \"basic framework of protections formed by the previously-approved procedures remain[ed] intact.\" Therefore, Judge Walton was satisfied that any compliance problems and relatively minor changes in the minimization procedures did not preclude the court from finding that the targeting and minimization procedures were consistent with the Fourth Amendment and the statutory requirements of Section 702.</p>",

Although the government was able to \nprovide additional information regarding this matter to the Court, inducting that this \nmatter had been resolved with respect to ongoing collection, the government \nrepresented that its efforts to identify previously acquired data potentially subject to \npurge were ongoing, and that further information on those efforts would be available in \nthe coming weeks. The government represented that this further information would be \ncritical for the Court in order to fulfill its statutorily required review obligations with \nrespect to the amendments to the minjmization procedures for the predecessor \ncertifications. \n7.  Because the record concerning these matters is incomplete, this Court has \nconcluded that it will not be able to complete its review of, and issue orders under 50 \nU.S.C. § 1881a(i)(3) concerning, the amendments to the predecessor certifications by \nAugust 30, 2013.

Accordingly, the government's \nrequest for approval is granted. \nI.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nThe amendments that are included as part of the November 15 Submission were executed \nby the Attorney General (\"AG\") and the Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\") pursuant to \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), which is codified at 50 \nU.S.C. § 1&  81a (2008). They are accompanied by three sets of revised minimization procedures \nfor use by the National Security Agency (\"NSA\"), the Federal Bureau ofinvestigation (\"FBI\"), \nand the Central Intelligence Agency_(\"CIA\"), re~pectively. The purpose of the amendments, \nwhich became effective immediately upon their execution, is to authorize the use of these revised \nminimization procedures in connection with information acquired under \noperation of law, the amendments included as part of the November 15 Submission \nsupersede the amendments that were submitted by the government on July 31, 2013, and which, \nas discussed below, were still pending before this Court for review on November 15.

See Aug. 30 Op. at 15-25. As discussed in more detail below, the only changes to \nthe procedures include: (1) new provisions in the NSA, FBI, and CIA minimization procedures \nrequiring additional analysis to confirm the \"foreignness\" of the target before certain categories \nof previously-acquired communications may be used in any manner; and (2) a new provision in \nthe FBI minimization procedures allowing the limited use of \"ad hoc\" storage systems to house \nFISA-acquired information. Accordingly, the Court incorporates by reference herein its August \n. 30  Opinion and focuses the discussion below on the new provisions and whether those \nprovisions alter the Court's recent conclusion that the NSA, FBI, and CIA minimization \nprocedures satisfy the requirements of Section 1801 (h) and the Fourth Amendment. \n1 continued) \n{ ••• \nlaw enforcement purposes[.] \n50 U.S.C. § 180l(h); see also id. § 1821(4).

The New \"Foreignness, Check Provisions of the NSA.

Approved for public release. \nBased upon the information then available, the Court determined in the August 30 \nOpinion that NSA was prepared to comply with the \"Post-Targeting Analysis\" provisions of the \nNSA minimization procedmes with respect to the information to be acquired pmsuant to \nSec Aug. 30 Op. at 10.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcluded that the noncompliance problem discussed above did not preclude it from finding, for \npurposes of the 2013  that NSA' s targeting procedures were \"reasonably designed\" \nto \"ensure that any acquisition authorized under [the 2013  is limited to targeting \npersons reasonably beJieved to be located outside the United States» and to ''prevent the \nintentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and aU intended recipients \nare known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\" See )4 at I 0-11 \n(citing Section 188la(d)(l)). \nHowever, NSA 's past noncompliance with the post-tasking analysis requirements of its \ntargeting procedures substantially affected the Court's review of the amendments to the prior \nSection 702 certifications that were included as part of the July 31 Submission.  See id. at 11 n.7. \nAs a result oft he noncompliance, it appeared likely that NSA had .failed totally to de task certain \nfacilities that were no longer eligible for Section 702 collection, and had failed to detask others in \na timely fashion. See id.  Those failures, in turn, likely resulted in NSA's acquisition of \ncommunications falling outside the scope of Section 702, as NSA no longer had a reasonable \nbelief that the users of such facilities were located outside the United States.  See,~.­\nNotice at 2-3 (disclosing two such situations). It also appeared that other communication.  . \nTOP SECRET//S.I//ORCON/NOFORN  Page 9 \nJune 13, 2017, Public Release  EFF v.

See Aug. 30 \nOp. at 30 at 11 n. 7.  Accordingly, the CoUJ1 was unable to complete its required review of the \namendments at that time. See id.  Until the scope of the past overcollection was determined, for \nexample, the Court could not adequately assess whether, fo.r purposes of information acquired \nunder past certifications, the then-proposed minimization procedures satisfied FISA's definition \nof minimization procedures, which requires, among other things, ..s pecific procedures\" that are \n\"reasonably designed ... to minimize the ... retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of \nnonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent \nwith the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence \ninfonnation.\" See id. (citing 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (h)(l)). Furthennore, because the acquisition of \ntelephone communications to or from persons located inside the United States is likely to \nconstitute \"electronic surveillance\" within the meaning of Section 1801(f), the Court observed \nthat any overcollection resulting from NSA's noncompliance with its targeting procedures \nTOP SECRET//SIJ/ORCON/NOJI'ORN  Page 10 \nJune 13, 2017, Public Release  EFFv.
