    "summary": "<p>On September 11, 2017, several states initiated this action in the District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging President Trump’s attempted revocation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The plaintiffs alleged that DACA provided invaluable protections to young people across their states and allowed them to pursue education and employment. In turn, DACA recipients have contributed to state economies and the educational experiences of all students in state school systems. The complaint argued that the proposed revocation violated Fifth Amendment Due Process and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The plaintiffs sought equitable estoppel to prevent the government from divulging the personal information of DACA recipients, as well as an order from the court enjoining the government from rescinding the program. </p><p>In 2012, the Obama administration created the DACA program via Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy statements. The program offered work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children (and who meet some additional requirements). As of 2017, there were an estimated 800,000 DACA recipients. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he was ending the program in March unless Congress acted within the next six months. As the plaintiffs' complaint highlights, the Obama administration made key promises to applicants when it promoted DACA: that any information they provided in the application process would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes, and that, barring criminal activity or fraud in their DACA applications, DACA recipients would be able to renew their status and keep their benefits.</p><p>The plaintiffs were the states of California, Maine, Minnesota, and Maryland. The complaint noted that California in particular was home to more DACA recipients than any other state in the country (over 200,000). The states argued that rescinding DACA \"violates fundamental notions of justice\" by leaving recipients without access to jobs and making them vulnerable to deportation. The complaint also alleged that DACA recipients were required to divulge confidential information in order to apply for the program, including information about their immigration status and address. Recipients were previously assured that the information would be kept confidential. By revoking DACA, the plaintiffs argued that the government created a \"confusing and threatening situation\" in which that private information was at risk of being used against recipients in future immigration proceedings. </p><p>The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James on Sept. 11, 2017, and reassigned to Judge William Alsup on Sept. 18, after it was related to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>(No. 17-cv-05211). The cases were subsequently related to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16160\"><i>Garcia v. United States of America</i></a> (No. 17-cv-5380), a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16156\"><i>City of San Jose v. Trump</i></a>, (No. 17-cv-5329), and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16220\"><i>County of Santa Clara v. Trump</i></a> (No. 17-cv-5823).</p><p>On October 6, in a related challenge led by <i>Regents of University of California</i> before this judge, the government filed the administrative record, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0051-0008.pdf\">here</a>, which included a series of government documents pertaining to DACA from its inception up to the decision to rescind it. On October 17, after the University in the related case moved to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record, the court ordered them to do so in all related cases, including this one. The court found that the defendants did not produce all documents leading to the rescission: specifically, they failed to produce related documents that Acting DHS Secretary Duke did not directly review. </p><p>The defendants moved to stay further proceedings at this court on October 18 in light of their intent to appeal this ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court denied the requested stay on October 19, and the defendants appealed the next day by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court and an emergency motion for stay. On October 23, the District Court replied to the Ninth Circuit's invitation to answer the government's petition, stating it would not stay proceedings in light of the narrow window of time until DACA was intended to end (March 5, 2018).</p><p>On November 16, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' motion for a writ of mandamus and vacated the stay of discovery and record expansion that had been entered, and the District Court immediately ordered the federal government to file an augmented administrative record by November 22. On November 17, the federal government filed an emergency motion that it intended to file an application for mandamus with the US Supreme Court no later than November 20. The government requested that the Ninth Circuit stay its order pending the Supreme Court's resolution of that petition. On November 21, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the federal government's motion, noting that jurisdiction was with the District Court and instructing the federal government that further relief must be sought in a new petition for mandamus. </p><p>Meanwhile, in the District Court, Judge Alsup on November 20 agreed to stay all discovery until December 22 when the augmented administrative record would be due. </p><p>On December 1, 2017, the government filed notice that it appealed the Ninth's Circuit denial of mandamus relief and applied for a stay to the Supreme Court. On December 20 in a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's denial and remanded the case, arguing that the District Court should have stayed implementation of the October 17 order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. The Supreme Court stated that the lower court should have \"first resolved the Government’s threshold arguments\" (that the Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA is unreviewable because it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act deprives the District Court of jurisdiction). Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative record. 138 S.Ct. 443 (2017). The same day, the District Court stayed the order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. 138 S.Ct. 371 (2017).</p><p>On January 9, 2018, the court denied the government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and provided provisional relief to the plaintiffs. The order indicated the court would separately dismiss the government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering that DACA remain in effect on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the rescission. However, the government did not need to process new applications from individuals who had never before received deferred action. 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011. The court then granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to dismiss on January 12, dismissing the plaintiffs'  Regulatory Flexibility Act and equitable estoppel claims as well as the individual plaintiffs' declaratory relief claims. The court sustained the plaintiffs' APA, due process, and equal protection claims (with a few exceptions from the various complaints of the related cases). 298 F. Supp.3 d 1304.</p><p>The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit on January 16, 2018. The government also sought certiorari from the US Supreme Court on January 18 while the Ninth Circuit appeal was pending, arguing that the Supreme Court's immediate review was warranted because of how long the appeal would take in the Ninth Circuit and how time-sensitive the issue was. The Supreme Court denied cert without prejudice on February 26, 2018, indicating the justices assumed \"that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case.\" 138 S.Ct. 1182.</p><p>The related cases were consolidated in the Ninth Circuit for the purposes of appeal. In February and March 2018, the parties and amici filed their briefs, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\">here</a>.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on November 8, 2018. The panel held that the government's decision to rescind DACA was reviewable because the government was not exercising discretion in rescinding the program, but rather acting out of a belief that DHS lacked the authority to issue DACA in the first place, and so rescission was necessary. The panel further concluded the decision was reviewable because it did not fall within one of the three discrete occasions when the INA bars judicial review of DHS decisions. 2018 WL 5833232.</p><p>As to the merits of a preliminary injunction, the panel held that \"DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion,\" and that the government's belief that DACA was illegal was wrong. Thus, the panel concluded the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits in showing that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The panel also held that a nationwide injunction was appropriate because it \"promotes uniformity in immigration enforcement, and is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress.\" Id.</p><p>The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari on Nov. 5, 2018.</p><p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in three DACA cases: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16162\"><i>NAACP v. Trump</i></a>, all of which were pending before different circuit courts of appeal. The Court consolidated the three cases (No. 18-587). </p><p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS’s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA, that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program, and that the rescission was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious in violation fo the APA. 140 S. Ct. 1891. </p><p>Following the Supreme Court's decision, in another case challenging the DACA recession, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16202\"><i>Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>, the Fourth Circuit issued a mandate to reinstate DACA and set aside the recession memo on a nationwide basis on June 30, 2020. On July 17, 2020, the District Court of Maryland ordered DHS to reinstate DACA as it existed before the issuance of the recession memo and ordered DHS to resume accepting initial DACA applications.</p><p>However, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf instead issued a memorandum entitled \"Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled 'Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" on July 28, 2020 (\"Wolf Memorandum\"). In this memo, Acting Secretary Wolf stated that he would reconsider DACA's future in light of the Supreme Court's decision. In the interim, the memo instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. Later in August, Deputy Director for Policy for USCIS Joseph Edlow issued a memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum.</p><p>On August 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court. </p><p>In response to the Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 2, 2020. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs substituted some of the defendants to reflect new individuals occupying the relevant roles and to add additional responsible officials, including Deputy Director for Policy Edlow. The amended complaint argued that the Acting Secretary Wolf actions were invalid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Action, Homeland Security Act, and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because he lacked proper authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum violated the APA because Wolf and Edlow acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the defendants from altering or limiting DACA program and vacating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda.</p><p>Before any additional activity on the amended complaint in this case, on December 4, the court in another case challenging the Wolf Memorandum,<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16130\"><i>State of New York v. Trump</i></a>, ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017 after it found that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary. The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years.  On December 7, 2020 <a href = \"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca\">USCIS</a> updated their website and indicated that effective that day, USCIS would accept initial applications, extend one-year DACA renewals to two-years, and accept applications for advance parole.</p><p>Then, in early 2021, President Biden took office. On the day of his inauguration (January 20, 2021), President Biden signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General “to preserve and fortify DACA.” In light of potential additional agency action to implement the memorandum, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay further proceedings and vacate pending deadlines on March 22, 2021. They agreed to provide the court with status updates every 60 days. The first is due May 24, 2021. This case is ongoing.</p>",

The State of California is home to, by far, more grantees of DefetTed Action for \n3  Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") than any other state, and the States of California, Maine, \n4  Maryland, and Minnesota (collectively, \"Plaintiff States\") combined are home to more than \n5  238,000 DACA grantees.  Defendants' actions in rescinding DACA are illegal and seriously harm \n6  Plaintiff States' interests in ways that have already started to materialize and that threaten to last \n7  for generations.  This program has allowed nearly 800,000 young people (including over 220,000 \n8  Californians) who have come of age in the United States- many of whom have known no other \n9  home-to come out of the shadows and study and work here without fear of depo1tation, \n10  enriching our States and communities.  DACA is a humane policy with a proven track record of \n11  success, and Defendants' rescission of DACA violates fundamental notions of justice. \n12  2.  On September 5, 2017, Defendant Acting Secretary of the Department of \n13  Homeland Security Elaine Duke (\"Duke\") issued a memorandum rescinding DACA.  Ex. A, \n14  Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y of Homeland Security to James W. McCament, \n15  Acting Dir., U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USC JS\"), et al., Rescission of the June \n16  15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals \n17  Who Came to the United States as Children\" (Sept. 5, 2017) (\"DACA Rescission Memorandum\"). \n18  Pursuant to that memorandum, Defendant Department of Homeland Security (\"OHS\") \n19  immediately ceased accepting new applications under the DACA program, immediately ceased \n20  granting advance parole (i.e., authorization for DACA grantees to leave the country), and \n21  declared that it wi II only issue renewals for current grantees whose DACA protection expires on \n22  or before March 5, 2018; these current grantees must apply for renewal by October 5, 2017. \n23  3.  The Trump Administration's elimination of DACA was unlawful on a number of \n24  grounds.  First, the DACA Rescission Memorandum violates the due process guarantee of the \n25  Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by substantially altering DHS's prior \n26  assurances regarding the use of information contained in DACA applications; Defendants should \n27  be equitably estopped from acting contrary to these assurances.  Second, OHS promulgated this \n28 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 37\nrule without providing notice or the opportunity to comment as required by the Administrative \n2  Procedure Act (\"APA\"), thereby depriving Plaintiff States of the opportunity to present important \n3  evidence to OHS about the overwhelming success of the DACA program in Plaintiff States as \n4  part of the rulemaking process.  Third, OHS violated the substantive requirements of the APA by \n5  proffering a legally insufficient justification for rescinding DACA, obscuring the true policy \n6  rationale for this substantial change, and otherwise violating independent constitutional and \n7  statutory provisions. Fourth, federal law does not permit this substantive change in OHS policy \n8  to be made without an analysis of the negative impact of rescinding DACA on small businesses, \n9  non-profits, and local government entities, including those in Plaintiff States.  Finally, Defendants \nIO  have discriminated against this class of young immigrants in violation of the equal protection \n11  guarantee of the Fifth Amendment by depriving them of their interests in pursuing a livelihood \n12  and furthering their education.  These interests are substantial, and Defendants deprived DACA \n13  grantees of them without a sufficient justification. \n14  4.  DACA grantees residing in Plaintiff States are employed by companies and non-\n15  profits, large and small, as well as State and municipal agencies, all of which benefit from their \n16  skills and productivity.  Through their employment and broader participation in the economy, \n17  DACA grantees contribute to the economic activity of Plaintiff States and the United States \n18  generally.  As residents of Plaintiff States, DACA grantees have also pursued educational \n19  opportunities at post-secondary institutions, enriching the educational experiences of all students \n20  and faculty by contributing their diverse life experiences and perspectives, while building upward \n21  career mobility for themselves.  In addition to substantially benefitting from DACA themselves, \n22  DACA grantees have taken advantage of the opportunities available to them under this program \n23  in a manner that has significantly enhanced Plaintiff States in a number of ways, helping to \n24  advance their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n25  5.  As a direct result of the decision to eliminate DACA, DACA grantees will lose \n26  their work authorization, requiring their employers to terminate them as employees.  As a result \n27  of losing employment, DACA grantees face the loss of employer-based health insurance, which \n28  has not only benefited them personally, but has reduced Plaintiff States' expenditures on \n2 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 37\nhealthcare to uninsured people and enhanced public health overall.  While education laws in \n2  California and other states will permit most DACA grantees who are in school to maintain their \n3  enrollment in post-secondary educational institutions even if they lose DACA protection, many \n4  are expected to disenroll because their inability to work will create financial obstacles to \n5  maintaining enrollment.  And others will disenroll simply because they may no longer be able to \n6  achieve career objectives commensurate with their skills and qualifications; still others may be \n7  afraid to interact with any government entity, even public schools or hospitals, once they lose \n8  DACA's protection from deportation.  Those DACA grantees who choose to remain enrolled will \n9  be unable to participate equally in other oppo1tunities generally available to students, such as paid \nIO  internships and externships, as well as study abroad programs. \n11  6.  Under the DACA program, grantees were authorized to apply for advance parole, \n12  which allowed many of them to return to the United States after visiting their families outside the \n13  country when family emergencies arose.  Defendants have abruptly terminated this authorization, \n14  even refusing to adjudicate already pending applications submitted by DACA grantees.  As a \n15  result of the termination, thousands of residents wi II be unable to visit family members or travel \n16  outside the United States for educational or employment purposes. It is also uncertain whether \n17  residents whose advance parole requests were previously approved and who are currently \n18  traveling abroad will face greater difficulty in being permitted to return home to the United \n19  States. \n20  7.  DACA grantees came to the United States through no volition of their own.  They \n21  grew up in this country and many have known no other home.  Prior to DACA, they faced fear of \n22  depottation, hardship, and stigma due to their status.  DACA has allowed them the stability and \n23  security they need to build their lives in the open.  Through their sudden and unlawful actions, \n24  Defendants are attempting to push DACA grantees back into the shadows of American life. \n25  8.  Due to Defendants' actions and representations, DACA grantees face risks as a \n26  result of their very patticipation in DACA-pa1ticularly if the DACA Rescission Memorandum is \n27  fully implemented.  When they applied for DACA, applicants were required to provide sensitive \n28  information to OHS- including their fingerprints, photos, home address, school location, and \n3 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 37\ncriminal records, however minor-in reliance on the government's repeated promises that it \n2  would not use the information against them to conduct enforcement actions.  The DACA \n3  Rescission Memorandum and associated Frequently Asked Questions dated September 5, 2017 \n4  (\"Rescission FAQs\"), attached hereto as Ex. 8, substantively change DHS's policy in a manner \n5  that places current and former DACA grantees at risk of deportation based on information \n6  previously disclosed to OHS in good faith. \n7  9.  Further, DH S's prior assurances to employers regarding the employment \n8  verification information they provided to employees to aid prospective DACA applicants are not \n9  discussed in the DACA Rescission Memorandum or Rescission FAQs, indicating that employers \n10  might now be subject to actions for unlawful employment practices despite DHS's earlier \n11  assurances that they would not be. \n12  I 0.  Defendants' rescission of DACA will injure Plaintiff States' state-run colleges and \n13  universities, upset the States' workforces, disrupt the States' statutory and regulatory interests, \n14  cause harm to hundreds of thousands of their residents, damage their economies, and hurt \n15  companies based in Plaintiff States. \n16  11.  The States of California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota respectfully request that \n17  this Cow1 enjoin OHS from rescinding DACA and declare that OHS is equitably estopped from \n18  using information gathered pursuant to the DACA program in immigration enforcement actions \n19  against current and former DACA applicants and grantees, and in actions against their current or \n20  former employers except as authorized previously under DACA. \n21  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n22  12.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 220 I (a). \n23  13.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 139l(b)(2) and \n24  1391( e)( I).  A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this \nr \n25  district; Plaintiff State of California resides in this district; and no real prope11y is involved in the \n26  action.  This is a civi I action in which Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers of \n27  such an agency. \n28 \n4 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 37\n14.  Intradistrict assignment is proper in San Francisco or Oakland pursuant to Local \n2  Rules 3-2(c) and (d) because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the \n3  claim occurred in the City and County of San Francisco. \n4  PARTIES \n5  PLAINTIFF STATE OF CALIFORNIA \n6  15.  The State of California, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \n7  sovereign State of the United States of America. \n8  16.  Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., is the chief executive officer of the State.  The \n9  Governor is responsible for overseeing the operations of the State and ensuring that its laws are \nIO  faithfully executed.  As the leader of the executive branch, the Governor is the chief of \n11  California's executive branch agencies, including those whose injuries are discussed in this \n12  Complaint.  Cal. Const. art V, § I. \n13  17.  Attorney General Xavier Becerra is the chief law officer of the State. The \n14  Attorney General is responsible for protecting California's sovereign interests, including the \n15  sovereign interest in enforcing California laws.  Cal. Const. att V, § 13. \n16  18.  California is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has standing to bring this \n17  action because of the injury to its state sovereignty caused by Defendants' rescission of DACA, \n18  including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \n19  interests, and its interests as parens patriae. \n20  19.  California is home to more than 379,000 DACA-eligible residents.  As of March \n21  2017, USCIS had approved 222,795 DACA applications from immigrants residing in California. \n22  Ex. C, USC IS, Number of Form 1-821 D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood \n23  Arrivals by Fiscal Year, Quarter, Intake Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (Mar. \n24  31, 2017) (\"USC IS Numbers\").  More than 30 percent of all DACA grantees in the entire country \n25  reside in California, giving California by far the largest population of DACA grantees of any \n26  state. \n27  20.  Indeed, in the first year of DACA, 13 percent of DACA requests nationwide \n28  (78,000) came from individuals in the Los Angeles area alone. \n5 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 7 of 37\n21.  California has an interest, reflected in its Constitution and state law, in prohibiting \n2  discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, and immigration status.  California's \n3  Constitution prohibits any discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.  See Cal. \n4  Const. art. I,§§ 8, 31.  California recognizes as civil rights an individual's opportunity to obtain \n5  employment, housing, real estate, full and equal utilization of public accommodations, public \n6  services, and education institutions without such discrimination.  See, e.g., Cal. Gov. Code \n7  §§ 11135, 12900-12907; Cal. Civ. Code§ 51(b).  California has a further interest, as evidenced \n8  by its Constitution, in prohibiting the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process, \n9  and in preventing any practice that denies equal protection of the laws. See Cal. Const. art. I,§ 7. \n10  22.  California's interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its residents, \nI I  including protecting its residents from harms to their physical or economic health, extends to all \n12  residents, regardless of immigration status.  See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code§ 3339(a); Cal. Gov. Code \n13  § 7285(a); Cal. Health & Safety Code § 24000(a); Cal. Labor Code § 1 I 7 I .5(a). \n14  23.  California has an interest in ensuring public safety within its borders and \n15  protecting the rights of its residents by maintaining an effective law enforcement system.  Like \n16  many local law enforcement agencies in California and throughout the nation, the State has \n17  concluded that public safety is best protected when all members of our community-regardless of \n18  immigration status- are encouraged to repo11 crimes and participate in policing efforts without \n19  fear of immigration consequences.  California has fu11her determined that the interests of public \n20  safety are best served by promoting trust between law enforcement and California residents, \n21  including members of the immigrant community.  By deferring the possibility of immediate \n22  deportation, the DACA program has removed a significant deterrent to immigrants approaching \n23  law enforcement for assistance when they have been victimized or have witnessed crimes. \n24  24.  California has an interest in promoting and preserving the public health of \n25  California residents.  Defendants' rescission of DACA will create serious public health problems. \n26 .  These include worsening the existing sho11age of physicians and gutting the home healthcare \n27  workforce for seniors and people with disabilities.  Fw1her, former DACA grantees will face \n28 \n6 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 8 of 37\nincreasing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts when they \n2  suddenly find themselves once again members of an underclass with an uncertain future. \n3  25.  The rescission of the DACA program will also harm California's interests in, and \n4  expenditures on, its educational priorities. California's state universities and colleges have made \n5  significant investments in financial aid and in other-programs to support these students, consistent \n6  with the interests of those institutions- and those of the State itself- in diversity and \n7  nondiscrimination.  California will lose that investment because of the rescission of DACA. The \n8  University of California (\"UC\") system estimates that it alone has approximately 4,000 \n9  undocumented students enrolled, of whom a substantial number are DACA recipients.  An \nIO  estimated 60,000 undocumented students attend California's community colleges, and 8,300 \n11  attend the California State Universities; a significant number of these students are DACA \n12  grantees. \n13  26.  UC also employs many DACA recipients at UC campuses and in UC medical \n14  centers as teaching assistants, research assistants, post-doctoral researchers, and health care \n15  providers.  DACA recipients often possess valuable foreign language skills.  As a result of \n16  DACA's termination, UC will lose the skills and talents of these employees. \n17  27.  Similarly, the loss of DACA grantees as professors, teachers, teachers' aides, \nI 8  administrators, and nurses from our primary and secondary schools, as well as the California \n19  State University and California Community College systems, will frustrate California's interests \n20  in the education of all its residents and harm Californians. \n21  28.  Immigration is an important economic driver in California.  California is the sixth \n22  largest economy in the world, and it is home to many small businesses, large corporations, non-\n23  profit organizations, public and private hospitals, and colleges and universities that will be \n24  adversely affected by the termination of DACA. \n25  29.  The cumulative economic harm to California from the rescission of DACA is \n26  significant.  According to one estimate, the State of California alone would suffer $65.8 billion in \n27  economic losses over a ten-year window as a result of DACA 's rescission. \n28 \n7 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 9 of 37\n30.  DACA grantees contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues.  DACA \n2  grantees average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers and are able to better \n3  contribute to our economy.  Studies show that after receiving DACA, many grantees purchase \n4  houses and cars for the first time, boosting the economy and generating state and local tax \n5  revenues.  According to one estimate, DACA-eligible residents contribute more than $534 million \n6  annually in state and local taxes in California alone; those annual state and local tax contributions \n7  are projected to decrease by $199 million when Defendants' rescission of DACA is complete. \n8  The State of California stands to lose an estimated $18.4 billion in taxes over ten years when the \n9  full impact of Defendants' rescission of DACA has taken effect. \n10  31.  Executives at some of the largest companies in California, and indeed, the nation, \n11  including Apple, Facebook, and Google, have been vocal in support of DACA grantees and have \n12  urged the President to retain DACA. Many have also been vocal about the harm that DACA 's \n13  repeal will cause to their companies and employees.  For example, the Chief Executive Officer of \n14  Apple, Tim Cook, noted that \"250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers,\" later adding, \n15  ''#Dreamers contribute to our companies and our communities just as much as you and I.\"  Tim \n16  Cook, Twitter (Sept. 3 & 5, 2017).  Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive \n17  Officers of Facebook and Google, respectively, have expressed similar sentiments.  See, e.g., \n18  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook (Sept. 5, 2017) (\"The young people covered by DACA are our \n19  friends and neighbors. They contribute to our communities and to the economy.\"); Sundar Pichai, \n20  Twitter (Sept. 5, 2017) (\"Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers.\"). \n21  32.  California, too, has an interest in securing the best possible employees and in \n22  managing its workforce.  California state agencies and institutions employ at least 48 DACA \n23  grantees, many of whom were hired because of their specialized skills and qualifications and who \n24  will be affected by the termination of DACA.  DACA grantees help further California's priorities \n25  to ensure, inter alia: public safety at the Departments of Corrections, Rehabilitation, Forestry, and \n26  Fire Protection; public health at the Departments of State Hospitals and Developmental Services; \n27  and infrastructure at the Departments of Transportation and Water Resources. California has \n28  expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage these DACA grantees, and stands to lose the \n8 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 10 of 37\nvalue of that investment- and the employees' ongoing labor- due to Defendants' rescission of \n2  DACA. \n3  33.  In sum, Defendants' rescission of DACA harms the State of California directly as \n4  well as indirectly through its effects on California residents, families, businesses, and institutions. \n5  PLAINTIFF STATE OF MAINE \n6  34.  The State of Maine is a sovereign State of the United States of America.  The \n7  Attorney General of Maine, Janet Mills, is a constitutional officer with the authority to represent \n8  the State in al I matters, and serves as its chief legal officer with general charge, supervision, and \n9  direction of the State's legal business.  The Attorney General's powers and duties include acting \nIO  on behalf of the State and the people of Maine in the federal courts on matters of public interest. \nI I  The Attorney General has the authority to file suit to challenge action by the federal government \n12  that threatens the pub Ii c interest and welfare of Maine residents as a matter of constitutional, \nI 3  statutory, and common law authority. \n14  35.  Maine is aggrieved by Defendants' actions and has standing to bring this action \n15  because of the injuries to the State caused by Defendants' rescission of DACA, including \n16  immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n17  36.  At the end of the first quarter of 2017, USCIS had accepted 134 initial applications \n18  and 4 IO renewal applications since 2012 for the DACA program in Maine, and in that same time \n19  had approved 95 initial applications and 334 renewal applications. Ex. C, USCIS Numbers. The \n20  DACA population in Maine makes up 4 percent of Maine's estimated undocumented population. \n21  37.  An estimated 83 of Maine's DACA recipients are employed.  The estimated \n22  annual GDP loss in Maine from removing DACA workers is $3.97 million. \n23  38.  DACA-eligible individuals currently contribute $330,000 a year in state and local \n24  taxes.  If I 00 percent of eligible individuals were enrolled, tax revenues would increase by \n25  $74,000.  If DACA protections are lost, Maine would lose an estimated $96,000 in state and local \n26  taxes. \n27  39.  Defendants' rescission of DACA will result in Maine's grantees losing their jobs \n28  and ability to attend college and graduate institutions.  Many businesses will lose valued workers. \n9 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 11 of 37\nRescission of work authorization wi 11 threaten DACA grantees' ability to support themselves and \n2  their families, and the forced separation of Maine families that wi II result from DACA 's \n3  rescission will further jeopardize the health and well-being of Maine residents. \n4  40.  Maine's population demographics demonstrate particular benefits that immigrants \n5  bring to the State's work force.  In 2014, almost one in five Mainers was already older than age \n6  65- the third highest share in any state in the country.  From 2011 to 2014, Maine experienced \n7  more deaths than births, one of only two states in the country to do so.  Many Maine employers \n8  from electronics manufacturers to meat processors-have struggled to find the workers they need \n9  in recent years to expand and keep growing in the State.  Jessica Lowell, Maine Employers Face \n10  a New Challenge: Not Enough Workers, Portland Press Herald, July 23, 2016, \n11  https://ti nyurl .com/v7 gsG Ian. \n12  41.  Maine has a strong public policy interest in prohibiting discrimination on the basis \n13  of race, color, or national origin.  See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 5, §§ 4681-4685. \n14  PLAINTIFF STATE OF MARYLAND \n15  42.  The State of Maryland is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n16  43.  The State is represented by and through the Attorney General of Maryland, Brian \n17  Frosh, its chief legal officer with general charge, supervision, and direction of the State's legal \n18  business.  The Attorney General's powers and duties include acting on behalf of the State and the \n19  people of Maryland in the federal courts on matters of public concern.  Under the Constitution of \n20  Maryland, and as directed by the Maryland General Assembly, the Attorney General has the \n21  authority to file suit to challenge action by the federal government that threatens the public \n22  interest and welfare of Maryland residents.  Md. Const. art. V, § 3(a)(2); 2017 Md. Laws, Joint \n23  Resolution I. \n24  44.  Maryland is aggrieved by Defendants' actions and has standing to bring this action \n25  because of the injury to its State sovereignty caused by Defendants' rescission of DACA, \n26  including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \n27  interests. \n28 \n10 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 12 of 37\n45.  Maryland is home to more than 20,000 young people who are immediately eligible \n2  for DACA, an additional 6,000 who may become eligible through enrollment in school, and an \n3  additional 7,000 who may become eligible on their 15th bi1thdays. \n4  46.  At the end of the first quarter of 2017, 11,513 initial applications and 12,357 \n5  renewal applications for the DACA program in Maryland had been accepted by USCIS. \n6  47.  If DACA is rescinded, Maryland will lose millions of dollars in state and local tax \n7  revenues.  DACA-eligible individuals currently contribute $40.8 million a year in state and local \n8  taxes.  If 100 percent of eligible individuals were enrolled, tax revenues would increase by $16.1 \n9  million. \n10  48.  Maryland has a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being, \n11  both economic and physical, of all its residents. \n12  49.  Fifty-five percent of DA CA-eligible individuals in Maryland are employed. \n13  DACA grantees work for both large and small businesses, which are critical to the State's \n14  economic viability.  In addition, DACA grantees in Maryland work in a wide array of fields, \n15  including healthcare, education, law, and social services. \n16  50.  Rescinding DACA will result in disruptions in each of these fields, as companies \n17  and non-profits will be forced to terminate qualified and trained employees without employment \n18  authorization. Estimates are that rescinding the DACA program will cost Maryland $509.4 \n19  million in annual GDP losses. \n20  51.  Additionally, rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their \n21  employer-based health insurance.  Without employer-based benefits, more Maryland residents are \n22  likely to refrain from seeking needed medical care.  As a result of foregoing treatment, including \n23  for preventative purposes, these residents will impose higher healthcare costs on Maine. \n24  52.  The rescission of DACA also threatens the welfare of both DACA grantees and \n25  their families, including some households with family members who are United States citizens. \n26  Rescission of work authorization will threaten DACA grantees' ability to suppo11 themselves and \n27  their families, and the forced separation of Maryland families that results from DACA 's \n28  rescission will further jeopardize the health and well-being of Maryland residents. \n11 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 13 of 37\n53.  Maryland also has a proprietary interest in hiring and training a qualified \n2  workforce.  Both the State and local jurisdictions employ DACA grantees, many of whom have \n3  specialized skills and qualifications.  The State and local governments will lose not only these \n4  employees, but also their significant investments in hiring and training the DACA grantees who \n5  work for them. \n6  54.  Rescinding DACA will adversely impact current DACA grantees enrolled in \n7  colleges and universities.  Without DACA's employment authorization, these students' \n8  educational and employment plans wi II be disrupted, if not aborted. \n9  55.  Disenrollment by DACA grantees will also harm Maryland's public colleges and \nIO  universities. The University of Maryland has emphasized the importance of its students who are \n11  DACA grantees.  See Wallace D. Loh, President's Statement on DACA Students, University of \n12  Maryland (Sept. 5, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/y6ulklrz.  In 2011, Maryland passed a law allowing \n13  undocumented students brought to the United States as children, or \"dreamers,\" to pay in-state \n14  tuition rates at the State's public institutions, and voters later approved the law in a referendum. \n15  2011  Md. Laws, Ch. 191.  In the 2015-16 academic year, over 500 dreamers were enrolled in \n16  Maryland public colleges at in-state tuition rates.  Rescinding DACA will result in many of these \nI 7  students leaving school, which harms both the individual students as well as the schools. \nI 8  Maryland's public institutions will lose the diversity and enrichment this population brings to the \n19  school community. \n20  56.  Maryland has a strong public policy interest in prohibiting discrimination on the \n21  basis of race, color, or national origin.  See Md. Code Ann., State Gov't §§ 20-302, 20-304, 20-\n22  40 I, 20-402, 20-602, 20-702, 20-705, 20-707, 20-90 I. The Maryland General Assembly has \n23  declared that \"assur[ing] all persons equal opportunity\" is necessary \"for the protection of the \n24  public safety, public health, and general welfare, for the maintenance of business and good \n25  government, and for the promotion of the State's trade, commerce, and manufacturers.\"  Md. \n26  Code Ann., State Gov't § 20-602. \n27 \n28 \n12 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 14 of 37\nPLAINTIFF STA  TE OF MINNESOTA \n2  57.  The State of Minnesota, which is a sovereign State of the United States of America, \n3  is aggrieved by Defendants' actions.  Minnesota has standing to bring this action because of the \n4  injuries caused by Defendants' rescission of the DACA program, including injuries to its \n5  sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests. \n6  58.  Attorney General Lori Swanson brings this action on behalf of Minnesota to \n7  protect the interests of Minnesota and its residents.  The Attorney General's powers and duties \n8  include acting in federal court in matters of State concern.  Minn. Stat.§ 8.01. \n9  59.  It is estimated that in 2016 there were 16,000 DACA-eligible individuals living in \n10  Minnesota. As of March 31, 2017, USC JS had approved 6,255 initial DACA applications and \n11  6,236 renewals for residents of Minnesota.  Ex. C, USCIS Numbers.  In addition to these DACA \n12  grantees, Minnesota has many residents who would have become eligible for DACA in the future. \n13  60.  Minnesota has a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being, \n14  both economic and physical, of all its residents. \n15  61.  DACA has allowed grantees to access a number of important benefits, including \n16  working legally and obtaining employer-based health insurance. \n17  62.  Rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their employer-based \n18  health insurance.  Without employer-based benefits, more Minnesota residents are likely to \n19  refrain from seeking out needed medical care.  As a result of foregoing treatment, including for \n20  preventative issues, these residents will impose higher healthcare costs on Minnesota. \n21  63.  The rescission of DACA also threatens the welfare of both Minnesota DACA \n22  grantees and their families. Many Minnesota DACA grantees live in households with family \n23  members who are American citizens.  Rescission of work authorization will threaten DACA \n24  grantees' ability to financially support themselves and their families, endangering the financial \n25  security of these families. It will also force separation of Minnesota families,jeopardizing their \n26  health and stability. \n27 \n28 \n13 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 15 of 37\n64.  Rescinding DACA will harm Minnesota's colleges and universities.  Minnesota \n2  law encourages attendance by DACA grantees at public universities within Minnesota.  See, e.g., \n3  Minn. Stat. § I 35A.043, .044. \n4  65.  The University of Minnesota has emphasized the importance of its DACA students. \n5  Eric W. Kaler, DACA Decision and the University's Stance, Office of the President, University of \n6  Minnesota, (Sept. 5, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/y9khzd2w.  Similarly, Minnesota State University, \n7  a system of 37 colleges and universities within Minnesota, has expressed its support for DACA \n8  and noted the significant contributions of DACA students to its institutions and the State \n9  economy.  Macalester College, a nationally ranked private liberal arts college in St. Paul, \n10  Minnesota, has also issued a statement emphasizing the importance of DACA students to the \nI I  college community and the economy at large.  President Brian Rosenberg, Message to the \n12  Community on the Elimination ofD  A CA, Macalester College (Sept. 5, 2017), \n13  h ttps ://ti nyurl .com/y79yvhhr. \n14  66.  Rescinding DACA will impair the ability of Minnesota universities to fulfill their \nI 5  educational missions and provide Minnesota residents with the skills necessary to become valued \n16  members of the Minnesota workforce. \n17  67.  One recent study found that 94 percent of the DACA grantees surveyed who were \n18  in school agreed that, because of DACA, they pursued educational opportunities that they \n19  previously could not. \n20  68.  The rescission of DACA will likely cause some grantees to leave Minnesota \n21  colleges and universities because they will be unable to work to meet their educational expenses. \n22  Furthermore, DACA students may determine that the cost of a college education is not a good \n23  investment because they will be unable to work after graduation. Those grantees who stay in \n24  school may take longer to complete their studies because of their inability to work.  Future DACA \n25  students may be deterred from enrolling at all.  As a result, Minnesota's universities will lose the \n26  diversity, enrichment, and new perspectives that this population brings to the school community, \n27  undermining the educational missions of the universities. These harms will also negatively affect \n28  the tuition revenues of Minnesota universities. \n14 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 16 of 37\n69.  A large number of Minnesota's postsecondary graduates remain in Minnesota after \n2  graduation.  Of Minnesota's 2013 postsecondary graduating class, 72 percent were employed in \n3  Minnesota two years after graduation.  Rescinding DACA will deprive Minnesota of the skills, \n4  earning, and tax-paying potential of those graduates of Minnesota universities who would stay in \n5  the State to join the State's workforce. \n6  70.  The Minnesota economy will also be negatively affected by the rescission of \n7  DACA.  Approximately 5,442 DACA grantees are employed in Minnesota.  If DACA is \n8  eliminated, these grantees will lose their work authorization and the State economy will lose \n9  approximately $376.7 million in annual GDP. \nIO  71.  In addition, rescinding DACA will negatively affect Minnesota tax revenue \n11  because DACA grantees make significant contributions to Minnesota state and local taxes.  One \n12  study estimates that the loss of employment caused by the rescission of DACA will result in \n13  Minnesota losing approximately $6.9 million annually in state and local tax revenue. \n14  72.  The rescission ofDACA will also adversely impact Minnesota employers. \n15  Minnesota businesses and other employers have hired DACA grantees because of the skills and \n16  other contributions they bring to these organizations.  Various Minnesota business leaders, \n17  including the Chief Executive Officer of Best Buy and the Senior Vice President of the Minnesota \n18  Chamber of Commerce, signed a letter to the President stressing the impo11ance of DACA to their \n19  organizations and the economy.  Open Letter Ji-om Leaders ofA merican Industry (Aug. 31, 2017), \n20  https://wv,;w.businessleadersdacaletter.corn/. \n21  73.  Minnesota has a strong public policy interest in prohibiting discrimination on the \n22  basis of race, color, or national origin.  See Minn. Stat. § 363A.02.  Minnesota has stated that such \n23  discrimination \"threatens the rights and privileges of the inhabitants of this state and menaces the \n24  institutions and foundations of democracy.\"  Id.  Minnesota recognizes an individual's \n25  opportunity to obtain employment, housing, real estate, full and equal utilization of public \n26  accommodations, public services, and educational institutions without such discrimination as a \n27  ·'civil right.\"  Id. \n28 \n15 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 17 of 37\n74.  In sum, the rescission of DACA substantially and adversely affects Minnesota's \n2  residents, educational institutions, economy, and families. \n3  DEFENDANTS \n4  75.  Defendant OHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \n5  DACA program.  DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States \n6  Government, and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(l ). \n7  76.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  She is \n8  responsible for implementing and enforcing immigration laws, and oversees OHS.  She is the \n9  author of the September 5, 2017 memorandum rescinding DACA.  She is sued in her official \nIO  capacity. \n11  77.  Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n12  departments responsible for the implementation and rescission of the DACA program. \n13  AL LEG AT  IO NS \n14  I.  ESTABLISHMENT OF DACA \n15  78.  Then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum on \n16  June 15, 2012 establishing the DACA program.  Ex. D, Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, \n17  Sec'y of OHS, to David Y. Aguilar, Acting Comm'r, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n18  (\"CBP\"), et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \n19  United States as Children (June 15, 2012) (\"DACA Memorandum\").  Under DACA, individuals \n20  who were brought to the United States as children and meet specific criteria may request deferred \n21  action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. \n22  79.  Defen-ed action is a long-standing mechanism under which the government \n23  forbears from taking removal action against an individual for a period of time.  The purpose of \n24  deferred action, a form of prosecutorial discretion, is to allow DHS to utilize its resources \n25  effectively and humanely. \n26  80.  The DACA Memorandum systematized the application of existing prosecutorial \n27  discretion for any applicant who satisfied each of the following criteria: \n28  a.  came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n16 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 18 of 37\nb.  had continuously resided in the United States for at least five years \n2  preceding the date of the memorandum and was present in the United States on the date of the \n3  memorandum; \n4  c.  was currently in school, had graduated from high school, had obtained a \n5  general education development certificate, or was an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast \n6  Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; \n7  d.  had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor \n8  offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise posed a threat to national security or public \n9  safety; and \n10  e.  was not above the age of thirty. \n11  Id. at I. \n12  81.  According to the DACA Memorandum, DACA 's purpose was to ensure that \n13  DHS's resources were appropriately allocated. to individuals who were higher priorities for \n14  immigration enforcement, recognizing among other things that young people brought here as \n15  children lacked the intent to violate the law.  DACA recognizes that there are \"certain young \n16  people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home\" and \n17  that immigration laws are not \"designed to remove productive young people to countries where \n18  they may not have lived or even speak the language.\"  Id. at 1-2. \n19  II.  DACA PROVIDES NUMEROUS BENEFITS \n20  82.  DACA grantees are provided with numerous benefits.  Most importantly, they are \n21  granted the right not to be arrested or detained based solely on their immigration status during the \n22  designated period of their deferred action.  See id. at 2-3. \n23  83.  DACA grantees are granted eligibility to receive employment authorization. \n24  84.  DACA also opened the door to allow travel for DACA grantees.  For example,  L \n25  DACA grantees were allowed to briefly depart the U.S. and legally return under certain \n26  circumstances, such as to visit an ailing relative, attend funeral services for a family member, \n27  seek medical treatment, or further educational or employment purposes.  8 U.S.C. \n28 \n17 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 19 of 37\n§ 1182(a)(9)(B)(i); see also Ex. E, USC IS, Frequently Asked Questions, OHS DACA FAQs \n2  (\"DACA FAQs\") (Apr. 25, 2017) Q57.  Travel for vacation is not permitted. \n3  85.  Unlike other undocumented immigrants, DACA grantees are not disqualified on \n4  the basis of their immigration status from receiving certain public benefits.  These include federal \n5  Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 161 l(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d).  As \n6  a result, and in reliance on DHS's oft-stated position that DACA and similar programs are a \n7  lawful exercise of the agency's authority, Plaintiff States have structured some schemes around \n8  DACA which allow, for example, applicants to demonstrate eligibility for state programs by \n9  producing documentation that they have been approved under DACA.  The rescission of DACA \nIO  undermines such regulatory frameworks. \nI I  86.  DACA grantees are able to secure equal access to other benefits and opportunities \n12  on which Americans depend, including opening bank accounts, obtaining credit cards, starting \n13  businesses, purchasing homes and cars, and conducting other aspects of daily life that are \n14  otherwise often unavailable for undocumented immigrants. \n15  87.  DACA fundamentally changed the lives of DACA grantees.  By no longer having \n16  to hide in the shadows, they obtained employment, sought higher education, pursued career paths, \n17  and became fully contributing members of society who paid taxes and participated in civic life. \n18  88.  These positive personal outcomes have also generated benefits to many sectors of \n19  the Plaintiff States' economies.  Defendants' decision to rescind DACA both terminates the \n20  ability of hundreds of thousands of the States' residents to remain part of the mainstream \n21  economy and harms the States and the communities that DACA recipients are part of, including \n22  large and small businesses, non-profits, and government entities where they work and do business. \n23  89.  The federal government has recognized that the United States \"continue[ s] to \n24  benefit ... from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want \n25  nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.\"  Ex. F, Letter from Jeh \n26  Charles Johnson, OHS Sec'y, to Judy Chu, U.S. House of Representatives (CA-27) (Dec. 30, \n27  2016) (\"Johnson Letter\"). \n28 \n18 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 20 of 37\nIll.  DEFENDANTS' PROMISES TO DACA GRANTEES: DACA GRANTEES RELIED ON \nREPEATED ASSURANCES THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL \n2  AND NOT USED FOR ENFORCEMENT \n3  90.  In an effort to encourage reluctant people to apply for DACA, OHS promised \n4  applicants on numerous occasions that information they provided as part of the DACA \n5  application process would be \"protected\" from use for immigration enforcement purposes. \n6  91.  In fact, only \"fraud or misrepresentation\" in the application process or \n7  \"[s]ubsequent criminal activity\" are grounds for revocation of DACA.  Ex. G, USC IS Approval \n8  Notice, Form 1-821 D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. \n9  92.  The government's commitment to DACA grantees was further communicated to \nIO  young people through its publication entitled \"National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): \n11  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\" This document sets forth the standards that \n12  OHS applies to DACA applications with nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or \n13  denying defetTed action. \n14  93.  USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that, except in limited \n15  circumstances, \"[i]nformation provided in [a DACA request] is protected from disclosure to \n16  [Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")] and CBP for the purpose of immigration \n17  enforcement proceedings.''  Ex. E, DACA FAQs Q19. \n18  94.  USCIS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that, except in limited \n19  circumstances, \"[i]f you have submitted a request for consideration of DACA and USC JS decides \n20  not to defer your case ... your case will not be referred to ICE for purposes of removal \n21  proceedings.\"  Id. at Q26. \n22  95.  In the exceptional circumstances under which USCIS would refer a DACA \n23  applicant to ICE, USCIS has affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that \"information \n24  related to your family members or guardians that is contained in your request will not be referred \n25  to ICE for purposes of immigration enforcement against family members or guardians.\"  Id. at \n26  Q20. \n27 \n28 \n19 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 21 of 37\n96.  The government's representations that information provided by a DACA grantee \n2  would not be used against him or her for later immigration enforcement proceedings are \n3  unequivocal and atypical.  For example, the federal government does not make the same \n4  representations for participants in other similar programs, such as Temporary Protected Status. \n5  See, e.g., USCJS, Temporary Protected Status, https://www.uscis.gov/hurnanitarian/temporarv-\n6  protected-status (last updated May 24, 2017). \n7  97.  Similarly, USC IS affirmatively represented to employers of DACA applicants that, \n8  except in limited circumstances, if they provide their employees \"with information regarding his \n9  or her employment to support a request for consideration of DACA ... . This information will \n10  not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes.\"  Ex. E, DACA FAQs Q76. \n11  98.  Additionally, in December 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles \n12  Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Representative Judy Chu (CA-27) regarding her concerns about the \n13  need to protect DACA-related information, acknowledging that there were, at the time, 750,000 \n14  DACA grantees who had \"relied on the U.S. government's representations\" about prohibitions on \n15  the use of such information for immigration enforcement purposes.  Johnson unequivocally \n16  stated: \"We believe these representations made by the U.S. government, upon which DACA \n17  applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored.\"  Ex. F, Johnson Letter at 1.  OHS \n18  cannot now seek to renege on these explicit assurances and promises. \n19  99.  These assurances were key to DACA 's success.  By making repeated, unique, and \n20  unequivocal representations, OHS induced individuals to rely on those representations and \n21  divulge sensitive personal information to apply for DACA despite the potential risk of deportation \n22  and removal, and induced employers to provide information to their employees to assist the \n23  latter's DACA applications, despite the potential risk of liability for the employers.  From January \n24  to March 2017 (the most recent period for which statistics are publicly available), USC IS \n25  accepted 132,790 combined initial and renewal requests to grant deferred action under the DACA \n26  program. \n27  I 00.  Indeed, in February 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly \n28  authored a OHS memorandum relating to enforcement priorities.  Ex. H, Memorandum from John \n20 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 22 of 37\nKelly, Sec'y of Homeland Security to Kevin McAleenan, Acting Comm'r, CPB, Enforcement of \n2  the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest (Feb. 20, 2017) (\"Enforcement Priorities \n3  Memorandum\").  The Enforcement Priorities Memorandum rescinded \"all existing conflicting \n4  directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and \n5  priorities for removal,\" including prior enforcement priorities, but specifically left OACA in \n6  place, unchanged. \n7  IV.  DHS RESCINDS DACA WITHOUT NOTICE, COMMENT, OR ANY SUFFICIENT \nEXPLANATION FOR ITS CHANGE IN POSITION \n8 \n9  IO I.  On September 5, 2017- more than five years after first encouraging individuals to \nIO  participate in DACA- DHS abruptly rescinded OACA by announcing that it would immediately \n11  cease accepting new applications.  OHS also announced it would only issue renewals for grantees \n12  whose deferrals expire before March 5, 2018, and only if they applied for renewal within one \n13  month of OHS's announcement, i.e., by October 5, 2017.  Ex. A, OACA Rescission \n14  Memorandum. \n15  I 02.  Based on this announcement, thousands of OACA grantees will lose their work \n16  authorization each day on a rolling basis beginning March 6, 2018. \n17  I 03.  The OACA Rescission Memorandum is a final, substantive agency action that \n18  required OHS to comply with the notice and comment requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. \n19  § 553(b). See Hemp Industries Ass 'n v. Drug Enf't Admi n., 333 F.3d I 082, I 087 (9th Cir. 2003). \n20  But the agency provided i10 opportunity for notice and comment before adopting this rule. \n21  I 04.  By failing to comply with these notice and comment requirements, OHS deprived \n22  Plaintiff States, their agencies and residents, and all other interested parties, of the opportunity to \n23  present impotiant evidence to the agency about the OACA program. \n24  I 05.  In the DACA Rescission Memorandum, OHS did not sufficiently explain its \n25  abrupt departure from prior agency statements regarding the necessity and legality of OACA. \n26  The single paragraph in the DACA Rescission Memorandum explaining the rationale behind this \n27  sudden shift merely asserts that OACA \"should be terminated\" based on consideration of two \n28  factors: (I) the appellate rulings in a case regarding a 2014 memorandum from then-OHS \n21 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 23 of 37\nSecretary Johnson that expanded DACA and created a new program, Deferred Action for Parents \n2  of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\"), Texas v.  United States, 809 F.3d 134 \n3  (5th Cir. 2015), aff'd by an equally divided court sub nom. United States v.  Texas,_ U.S. _, \n4  136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); and (2) a September 4, 2017, letter from Attorney General Jefferson B. \n5  Sessions arguing that DACA was \"unconstitutional\" and was invalid for the same reasons the \n6  Fifth Circuit struck down DAPA in the Texas case.  Ex. I, Letter from Jefferson B. Sessions to \n7  Duke (Sept. 4, 2017) (\"Sessions Letter\"). \n8  I 06.  DHS ignored obvious differences between DACA and DAPA when reaching this \n9  conclusion.  Further, DHS ignored the fact that the legality of DACA was never directly at issue \nIO  in the Texas case, and not ruled on by the Fifth Circuit.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum \n11  also erroneously implied that the Supreme Court's summary affirmance of the Texas decision by \n12  an equally divided court has precedential effect.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum cannot \n13  survive judicial review under the APA when it is predicated on an incorrect legal premise.  See, \n14  e.g., Massachusetts v.  EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 532-535 (2007); Safe Air For Everyone v. US EPA, \n15  488 F.3d I 088, 110 I (9th Cir. 2007). \n16  I 07.  Notably, in the DACA Rescission Memorandum, DHS did not offer its own \n17  considered legal views, and neither the Sessions Letter nor the DACA Rescission Memorandum \n18  addressed any of the findings articulated in support of the DACA Memorandum or explained why \n19  the agency is so sharply departing from both its prior legal position that programs like DACA are \n20  lawful and guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel that supported \n21  DACA 's lawfulness.  Ex. J, Memorandum Opinion, The Department of Homeland Security's \n22  Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to \n23  Defer Removal of Others, 38 Op. O.L.C. _(Nov. 19, 2014). \n24  I 08.  Other than the above conclusory assertions of DACA 's legal infirmity, OHS failed \n25  to offer any explanation of why it believed that rescinding DACA was warranted.  The DACA \n26  Rescission Memorandum did not even address the rationale that DHS expressed in 2012 in the \n27  DACA Memorandum regarding the use of prosecutorial discretion to focus resources and \n28 \n22 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 24 of 37\npriorities on lowest priority individuals, much less offer any explanation as to why those factors \n2  have changed so radically as to justify rescinding DACA now. \n3  I 09.  Hours after the DACA program was rescinded, purportedly due to its illegality, \n4  President Trump tweeted that, if Congress fails to provide similar protections through legislation, \n5  \"I will revisit this issue!\"  Ex. K, Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (Sept. 5, 2017, \n6  5:38 p.m.).  This statement suggests that he believes he has authority to reinstate some or all of \n7  the DACA program without Congressional authorization, further undermining DHS's ostensible \n8  rationale for rescinding. \n9  V.  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STATEMENTS FURTHER DEMONSTRATE ILLEGALITY OF \nDACA RESCISSION \n10 \n11  110.  Defendants' stated justification for rescinding DA CA- that is, its purported legal \n12  infirmity- has been contravened by a number of their own statements regarding undocumented \n13  immigrants, many of which are false and/or misleading, and as such provide an impermissible \n14  basis for rescinding DACA.  In doing so, Defendants abused their discretion and acted in an \n15  arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the APA. \n16  111.  On September 5, 2017, just prior to Attorney General Sessions's announcement \n17  rescinding the DACA program, President Trump tweeted, \"Congress, get ready to do your job -\n18  DACA !\" Donald J. Trump, Twitter (Sep. 5, 2017 5 :04 a.m.).  Id. at 2. A few minutes thereafter, \n19  President Trump retweeted a statement that \"We are a nation of laws.  No longer will we \n20  incentivize illegal immigration.  LAW AND ORDER! #MAGA,\" and \"Make no mistake, we are \n21  going to put the interest of AMERICAN CITIZENS FIRST!\"  Donald J. Trump, Twitter (Sep. 5, \n22  2017.). Id. at 3.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum makes no reference to such interests to \n23  explain the agency's action. \n24  112.  On the same day, President Trump issued a written statement on the rescission of \n25  the DACA program that stated: \"The temporary implementation of DACA .. . helped spur a \n26  humanitarian crisis- the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America \n27  including, in some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout \n28  our country, such as MS-I 3. Only by the reliable enforcement of immigration law can we \n23 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 25 of 37\nproduce safe communities, a robust middle class, and economic fairness for all Americans.\"  Ex. \n2  L, Statement from President Donald J. Trump (Sept. 5, 2017).  The DACA Rescission \n3  Memorandum makes no reference to unaccompanied minors, public safety concerns, or economic \n4  interests to explain the agency's action. \n5  113.  During his announcement rescinding the DACA program, Attorney General \n6  Sessions justified the decision by stating that the DACA program \"contributed to a surge of \n7  unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences.  It \n8  also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to \n9  illegal aliens.\"  Ex. M, Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA (Sept. 5, 2017). \n10  Again, the DACA Rescission Memorandum makes no reference to humanitarian or economic \n11  interests to explain the agency's action. \n12  114.  Attorney General Sessions, while a United States Senator from Alabama, made \n13  similar statements regarding undocumented individuals seeking employment (\"I'm a minority in \n14  the U.S. Senate ... in questioning whether we should reward people who came into the country \n15  illegally with jobs that Americans would like to do.\").  Seung Min Kim, The Senate's Anti-\n16  Immigration Warrior, Politico (Mar. 5, 2015) https://tinyurl.com/znog262. That same year, then-\n17  senator Sessions praised the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, whose namesake, Representative Albert \n18  Johnson, used racial theory as the basis for its severe immigration restrictions, which included \n19  barring Asian immigration entirely. See Interview by Stephen Bannon with Sen. Jefferson B. \n20  Sessions, Brietbart News (Oct. 5, 2015), audio available at https://tinyurl.co111/y8gbj6vk; see also \n21  Adam Serwer, Jeff Sessions 's Unqualified Praise for a 1924 immigration Law, The Atlantic (Jan. \n22  10, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/vbzdo96u. \n23  115.  These statements by the Trump Administration in the context of its decision to \n24  rescind DACA- that DACA created a surge in illegal immigration, and that DACA grantees take \n25  jobs away from other American workers and weaken the middle class-suggest that the DACA \n26  Rescission Memorandum's cursory statements regarding the legality of DACA do not set forth \n27  the agency's true rationale for rescission. The APA requires governmental agencies to publicly \n28  state a sufficient justification for their actions, particularly where, as here, Plaintiff States, as well \n24 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 26 of 37\nas their agencies, institutions, and residents, have relied upon DHS's prior statements to their \n2  detriment.  See Perez v. Mortg.  Bankers Ass 'n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1209(2015); FCC v. Fox \n3  Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Defendants have failed to do so. \n4  116.  Moreover, these statements are wholly controverted by available evidence \n5  demonstrating the contributions of DACA grantees to Plaintiff States and to the United States as a \n6  whole, as explained above.  See Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass 'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \n7  Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (an agency rule is arbitrary and capricious when the explanation \n8  offered by the agency \"runs counter to the evidence before the agency\"). \n9  VI.  FORMER DACA GRANTEES ARE AT RISK OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT BASED \nON INFORMATION THEY ENTRUSTED TO DEFENDANTS AS PART OF DACA \nIO  APPLICATIONS \nII  117.  In rescinding the DACA Memorandum, Defendants have created a confusing and \n12  threatening situation for Plaintiff States and their residents, including for DACA grantees who \n13  will soon begin losing their DACA protection under the DACA Rescission Memorandum. \n14  118.  The DACA application form requires applicants to provide a wealth of personal, \n15  sensitive information, including the applicant's lack of lawful immigration status, address, Social \n16  Security number, and the name and location of his or her school, if applicable.  Ex. N, USCIS, \n17  Form 1-821D  , Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  The application process \n18  also required that all DACA applicants undergo biographic and biometric background checks, \n19  which includes fingerprinting, before USCIS considered their DACA requests.  DACA applicants \n20  provided this information based on Defendants' representations about the terms of the program \n21  and the manner in which information would be protected. \n22  119.  Former DACA grantees now face a real risk of having the sensitive information \n23  that they provided to OHS in their applications or renewal requests (for example, fingerprints) \n24  used against them for future immigration enforcement proceedings.  This, despite the repeated \n25  assurances discussed above that Defendants would do no such thing. \n26  120.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum does not provide adequate assurances that \n27  this information will not be used for enforcement purposes following DACA 's termination. \n28 \n25 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 27 of 37\n121.  The former FAQs to the OACA Memorandum-government representations under \n2  which all OACA grantees submitted their applications- unequivocally stated: \"Information \n3  provided in this request is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \n4  immigration enforcement proceedings,\" with limited exceptions where \"the requestor meets the \n5  criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear [\"NTA\"] or a referral to ICE under the [NTA] \n6  criteria\" (emphasis added).  Ex. E, OACA FAQs Ql9. \n7  122.  The Rescission FAQs that OHS produced to accompany the OACA Rescission \n8  Memorandum provide inadequate assurances that information will be protected, and state: \n9  \"Generally, information provided in OACA requests will not be proactively provided to other \nIO  law enforcement entities (including ICE and CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \n11  proceedings unless the requestor poses a risk to national security or public safety, or meets the \n12  criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear [\"NTA  ''] or a referral to ICE under the [NTA] \n13  criteria.\"  Ex. B, Rescission FAQs Q8 ( emphasis added). \n14  123.  The addition of the qua Ii fier \"general ly\"-devoid of any apparent criteria for when \n15  OHS would deviate from the \"general\" policy of non-referral to ICE- and removal of the \n16  unequivocal statement that information is \"protected\" strongly suggests that, in fact, OHS now \n17  views OACA grantees' sensitive information as available to ICE for previously prohibited \n18  purposes, including immigration enforcement. \n19  124.  DACA applicants are also required to provide OHS with a detailed history of their \n20  criminal arrests and convictions, including all misdemeanors, however minor. \n21  125.  OACA applicants have relied in good faith on OHS's promises not to use the \n22  information against them and forthrightly informed DHS of minor criminal offenses of which \n23  they had been convicted (o r for which they were only arrested, regardless of whether they were \n24  ultimately convicted).  Individuals who applied for OACA with only minor criminal offenses \n25  could gain approval under OACA nonetheless because OHS did not regard them as a threat or bar \n26  to OACA, since they were of the very lowest enforcement priority.  They are now under even \n27  more threat than other OACA grantees. \n28 \n26 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 28 of 37\n126.  President Trump also has taken affirmative steps to set the table for eliminating \n2  privacy protections applicable to OACA data.  In January 2017, President Trump issued an \n3  Executive Order entitled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" directing \n4  all agencies, including OHS, to \"ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not \n5  United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act \n6  regarding personally identifiable information.\"  Ex. 0, Exec. Order No. 13,768, 82 Fed. Reg. \n7  8799 § 14 (Jan. 25, 2017).  OHS has confirmed that its new privacy policy, adopted in response to \n8  the Executive Order, \"permits the sharing of information about immigrants and non-immigrants \n9  with federal, state, and local law enforcement.\"  Ex. P, OHS Privacy Policy 2017-0 I Questions & \nIO  Answers No. 6 (Apr. 27, 2017). \nI I  127.  Until February 2017, DHS's enforcement priorities were generally consistent with \n12  the DACA Memorandum, prioritizing people who had committed felonies, serious \n13  misdemeanors, or multiple less serious misdemeanors, and making DACA grantees (and others \n14  similarly situated) the lowest enforcement priority. \n15  128.  The February 2017 Enforcement Priorities Memorandum substantively changed \n16  policy with respect to how OHS treats individuals with criminal history and radically broadened \n17  the categories of people who are to be prioritized for removal.  Whereas OHS previously \n18  prioritized individuals who had been convicted of serious criminal offenses, the new categories \n19  now include, among others, those who: \n20  (I) Have been convicted of any criminal offense; \n21  (2) Have been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved; [and] \n22  (3) Have committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense[.] \n23  Ex. H, Enforcement Priorities Memorandum at 2. \n24  Thus, people who have not been convicted of, but only charged with, any criminal offense \n25  (or even never charged, but somehow determined to have committed an act constituting a \n26  chargeable criminal offense), no matter how low-level, are now prioritized for immigration \n27  enforcement. Because any offense triggers priority enforcement, this includes various lower level \n28 \n27 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 29 of 37\noffenses that DACA applicants were required to disclose but that did not make them ineligible for \n2  DACA. \n3  I 29.  The sweeping Enforcement Priorities Memorandum replaced DHS's previous, \n4  more targeted enforcement priorities. Although this memorandum specifically exempted the \n5  DACA program from these new priorities, it is not clear whether or how they apply to DACA \n6  grantees and those who lose their protections on a rolling basis in light of the DACA Rescission \n7  Memorandum. \n8  130.  Given these developments- particularly the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum \n9  significantly broadening enforcement priorities and the Rescission FAQs changing DHS's prior \nIO  policy to shield DACA applicants' information from ICE- the criteria under which current and \nI I  former DACA grantees with minor criminal histories are considered for referral to ICE have \n12  substantively changed.  These individuals are now in danger of being placed in removal \n.13  proceedings based on information they provided in reliance on DHS's promises. \n14  131.  These changes signal Defendants' intent to renege on their assurances and \n15  promises and subject DACA applicants to immigration enforcement.  At the very least, these \n16  changes create confusion about the new risk faced by current and former DACA grantees and \n17  former applicants, patticularly those whose DACA protection is ending under the DACA \n18  Rescission Memorandum. \n19  I 32.  Indeed, on June I 3, 2017, in testimony before the House Appropriations \n20  Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan stated \n21  as to \"every immigrant in the country without papers,\" that they \"should be uncomfortable.  You \n22  should look over your shoulder.  And you need to be worried.\"  Immigration and Customs \n23  Enforcement & Customs and Border Protection FYJ8 Budget Request Before the H. Comm. on \n24  Appropriations, I 15th Cong. (2017) 2017 WLNR 18737622 (emphasis added). \n25  133.  CNN repo1ted that Homan \"doubled down\" on these statements in an interview \n26  later that week, quoting him to state that '\"Trump and his administration have made clear that any \n27  undocumented immigrant could be arrested and face deportation proceedings at any time, unless \n28  they have current and valid protection under DACA. \"' Tai Kopan, ICE Director: Undocumented \n28 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 30 of 37\nImmigrants 'Should Be Afraid,' CNN (June 6, 2017), https://tinyurl .com/y88h6zuo (quoting \n2  Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan) (emphasis added). \n3  134.  On April 19, 2017, Attorney General Sessions stated in an interview on Fox News' \n4  \"Happening Now\" program- in response to a question regarding the deportation of a DACA \n5  grantee- that '\"[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come \n6  here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not subject to being \n7  deported- well, they are .. . we can't promise people who are here unlawfully that they aren't \n8  going to be deported.\"'  Adam Shaw, Sessions Defends Immigration Policies After Reported \n9  'DREAMer' Deportation, Fox News (Apr. 19, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/kym82ce (quoting \n10  Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions). \n11  135.  Moreover, current litigation in federal court in Georgia demonstrates that even \n12  before the DACA Rescission Memorandum, DHS was terminating individuals' DACA due to the \n13  Enforcement Priorities Memorandum's changed priorities.  In that case, Colotl v. Kelly, DHS \n14  admitted on the record that Ms. Colotl had met and continued to meet all five DACA \n15  criteria.  Order [on Preliminary Injunction Motion], Colotl Coyotl v. Kelly, No. 17-1670 (N.D. \n16  Ga., June 12, 2017) ECF No. 28 at 17-18.  The only reason for the change in DHS's decision was \n17  that-despite the previous assurances by DHS that DACA-related history would not be used \n18  against applicants and with no change in Ms. Colotl's criminal history since her application-she \n19  had become an enforcement priority under the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum \"[ d]ue to \n20  [her] criminal history.\"  Id. at 6, 18.  That criminal history, stemming from a 20 IO arrest for \n21  allegedly blocking traffic while waiting for a parking space, had been disclosed on Ms. Colotl's \n22  initial DACA application and subsequent renewal requests, each of which were approved until the \n23  denial based solely on the Enforcement Priorities Memorandum.  The court ruled in favor of Ms. \n24  Colotl, granting her request for a preliminary injunction and holding that since DACA was still in \n25  effect at the time OHS sought to revoke her DACA, and DHS had established procedures with \n26  respect to notice and termination, she was likely to prevail on her claim that OHS violated the \n27  APA by failing to comply with its own administrative processes and procedures.  Id. at 30-33. \n28 \n29 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 31 of 37\n136.  Defendants' conduct in inducing DACA applicants to provide sensitive personal \n2  information and then removing that protection impacts all DACA grantees, not just those with \n3  minor criminal histories.  DACA applicants were not only required to provide information that \n4  could be used to easily find and arrest them; they were required to undergo fingerprinting \n5  regardless of criminal history.  DACA grantees are now at risk that this type of biometric \n6  information will be used against them for immigration enforcement purposes. \n7  VII.  DACA GRANTEES CAN No LONGER TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY \n8  137.  Under DACA, DACA grantees were allowed to apply to receive authorization \n9  from USC IS for \"advance parole\" to travel outside of the United States by submitting Form 1-\n1O    131, Application for Travel Document and paying a filing fee of $575.  USC IS approves advance \n11  parole on a case-by-case basis. \n12  138.  USC IS affirmatively represented to DACA applicants that, if USC IS decides to \n13  defer action, the applicant may request advance parole to travel outside the United States for \n14  educational, employment, or humanitarian purposes.  Ex. E, DACA FAQs Q57. \n15  139.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum terminated the ability of DACA grantees to \n16  travel outside the United States during their renewed benefit period, including for those who have \n17  already submitted requests for advance parole in reliance on DHS's prior representations that \n18  advance parole was available to them.  Under the DACA Rescission Memorandum, DHS is now \n19  categorically prohibited from granting advance parole for DACA grantees and \"[ w] ill not approve \n20  any new Form 1-131  applications for advance parole under standards associated with the DACA \n21  program[.]''  Ex. A, DACA Rescission Memorandum.  In addition, DHS \"[w]ill administratively \n22  close all pending Form 1-131 applications for advance parole filed under standards associated \n23  with the DACA program, and will refund all associated fees.\"  Id.  Those who have pending \n24  applications are therefore denied advance parole without any assessment being conducted using \n25  the criteria set forth previously by DHS for advance parole requests. \n26  140.  Many DACA grantees have applied for and received advance parole from USCJS \n27  and have paid the required fees.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum states that DHS will \n28  \"generally\" honor the previously approved applications for advance parole, clearly signaling that \n30 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 32 of 37\nsometimes it will not.  Many of those DACA grantees who relied on USCIS authorization of \n2  advance parole are currently travelling abroad visiting family or for other authorized \n3  reasons.  Given DHS's unambiguous shift in policy towards prohibiting the case-by-case \n4  determination of advance parole for other DACA grantees, DACA grantees with approved \n5  advance parole now face uncertainty and risk of not being able to return to their homes in the \n6  United States. \n7  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n8  (Violation of Fifth Amendment - Due Process - Information Use) \n9  I 4 I.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \nIO  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \nI I  142.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that immigration \n12  enforcement actions taken by the federal government be fundamentally fair. \n13  143.  Given the federal government's representations about the allowable uses of \n14  information provided by DACA applicants, Defendants' change in policy on when to allow the \nI 5  use of information contained in DACA applications and renewal requests for purposes of \n16  immigration enforcement, including identifying, apprehending, detaining, or deporting non-\n17  citizens, is fundamentally unfair. \n18  144.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the due process guarantee \n19  of the Fifth Amendment. \n20  145.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and their residents. \n21  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n22  (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n23  146.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  I \n~ \n24  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n25  147.  The APA requires the Court to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action\" taken \n26  ·'without observance of procedure required by law.\"  5 U .S.C. § 706(2)(0). \n27 \n28 \n31 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 33 of 37\n148.  OHS is an \"agency\" under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  The DACA Rescission \n2  Memorandum is a \"rule\" and an \"agency action\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(  4), ( 13), and \n3  constitutes \"[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is \n4  no other adequate remedy in a cou11.\"  5 U.S.C. § 704. \n5  149.  With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency rules must go through notice-\n6  and-comment rulemaking. 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n7  150.  Defendants promulgated and have relied upon the DACA Rescission \n8  Memorandum without notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation of the APA. \n9  151.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and their residents, \nIO  who have been denied the oppor1unity to comment about Defendants' decision to repeal DACA. \nI I  These injuries, including specific harms alleged above to the Plaintiff States' universities, \n12  agencies and institutions, and their economies and healthcare systems, all fall within the zone of \n13  interests encompassed by the broad scope of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"!NA\"), 8 \n14  U.S.C. et seq. \n15  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n16  (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n17  I 52.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set fo11h in \n18  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \nI 9  I 53.  The APA requires the Cou11 to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \n20  \"(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) \n2 I  contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [o r] (C) in excess of statutory \n22  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right[.]\"  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n23  154.  In implementing the DACA Rescission Memorandum without a proper basis, \n24  Defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, have abused their discretion, have acted \n25  otherwise not in accordance with law, and have taken unconstitutional and unlawful action in \n26  violation of the APA. \n27 \n28 \n32 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 34 of 37\n155.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and their residents. \n2  These injuries fall within the zone of interests encompassed by the INA. \n3  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n4  (Violation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act) \n5  156.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n6  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n7  157.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (\"RFA\"), requires federal \n8  agencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \n9  final versions of those analyses for public comment.  5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \nIO  158.  \"Small entities\" for purposes of the RFA include small businesses, small \n11  nonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions.  5 U.S.C. § 60 I (6). \n12  159.  The DACA Rescission Memorandum isa \"rule\" under the RFA.  5 U.S.C. \n13  § 60 I (2). \n14  160.  The actions that OHS has taken to implement the DACA Rescission Memorandum \n15  are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \n16  5U.S.C.§602(a)(l). \n17  161.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of the rule. \n18  162.  Defendants' failure to issue the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses \n19  violates the RF A and is unlawful. \n20  163.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and to their \n21  residents, who have been denied the ability to comment on the impact of DACA's rescission on \n22  srnal I entities. \n23  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  (Declaratory Relief - Equitable Estoppel) \n25  164.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n26  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n27 \n28 \n33 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 35 of 37\n165.  Through its conduct and statements, OHS represented to DACA applicants that \n2  information collected as part of their applications would not be used against them in future \n3  immigration proceedings and that DACA was a lawful exercise of its discretion. \n4  166.  In reliance on DHS's repeated assurances, DACA applicants, risking removal and \n5  deportation, came forward and identified themselves to OHS and provided detailed information, \n6  including fingerprints and criminal history, in order to patiicipate in DACA. \n7  167.  Throughout the life of DACA, OHS continued to make affirmative representations \n8  about the use of information as well as the validity and legality of programs like DACA.  DACA \n9  applicants relied on DHS's continuing representations to their detriment. \nIO  168.  DACA grantees rearranged their lives to become fully visible and contributing \n11  members of society by seeking employment, pursuing higher education, and paying taxes, but are \n12  now at real risk of removal and deportation, particularly those with minor criminal histories who \n13  fall squarely within the new enforcement priorities set fotih in the Enforcement Priorities \n14  Memorandum. \n15  169.  Accordingly, Defendants should be equitably estopped from using information \n16  provided to OHS pursuant to DACA for immigration enforcement purposes, except as previously \n17  authorized under DACA. \n18  170.  An actual controversy between Plaintiff States and Defendants exists as to whether \n19  Defendants should be equitably estopped. \n20  171.  Plaintiff States are entitled to a declaration that Defendants are equitably estopped. \n21  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n22  (Violation of Fifth Amendment - Equal Protection) \n23  172.  The Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \n24  in each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n25  173.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government \n26  from denying equal protection of the laws. \n27 \n28 \n34 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 36 of 37\n174.  The rescission of DACA violates fundamental conceptions of justice by depriving \n2  DACA grantees, as a class, of their substantial interests in pursuing a livelihood to support \n3  themselves and fu1ther their education. \n4  175.  The deprivation of these interests is directly traceable to the Defendants' rescission \n5  of DACA and cannot be sufficiently justified by federal interests. \n6  176.  Through the above actions, Defendants have discriminated against DACA grantees \n7  in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n8  177.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to the Plaintiff States and their \n9  residents.  Among other things, the Plaintiff States will be impacted because DACA grantees will \nIO  no longer be able to work as State employees, contribute to the States' economies, or attend the \n11  States' educational institutions. \n12  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff States respectfully request that this Cou1t enter judgment in their favor, \n14  and grant the following relief: \n15  1.  Declare that the DACA Rescission Memorandum is unauthorized by and contrary \n16  to the Constitution and laws of the United States; \n17  2.

Duke \nActing Secretary \nSUBJECT: \nRescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial \nDiscretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as \nChildren\" \nThis memorandum rescinds the June 15, 2012 memorand.um entitled \"Exercisihg \nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States \nas Children,\" which established the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (\"DACA\"). For the reasons and in the manner outlined below, Department of \nHomeland Security personnel shall take all appropriate actions to execute a wind \ndown of the program, consistent with the parameters established in this \nmemorandum. \nBackground \nThe Department of Homeland Security established DACA through the issuance of a \nmemorandum on June 15, 2012. The program purported to use deferred action-an \nact of prosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by \ncase basis-to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not \notherwise acted to provide by law.[l] (#_ftnl) Specifically, DACA provided certain \nillegal aliens who entered the United States before the age of sixteen a period of \ndeferred action and eligibility to request employment authorization. \nOn November 20, 2014, the Department issued a new memorandum, expanding the \nparameters of DACA and creating a new policy called Deferred Action for Parents of \nAmericans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\"). Among other things-such as \nthe expansion of the coverage criteria under the 2012 DACA policy to encompass \naliens with a wider range of ages and arrival dates, and lengthening the period of \ndeferred action and work authorization from two years to three-the November 20, \n2014 memorandum directed USCIS \"to establish a process, similar to DACA, for \nexercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by \ncase basis,\" to certain aliens who have \"a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or \nlawful permanent resident.\" \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 8\nPrior to the implementation of DAPA, twenty-six states-led by Texas-challenged \nthe policies announced in the November 20, 2014 memorandum in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of Texas. In an order issued on February 16, 2015, the \ndistrict court preliminarily enjoined the policies nationwide.[2] (#_ftn2) The district \ncourt held that the plaintiff states were likely to succeed on their claim that the DAPA \nprogram did not comply with relevant authorities. \nThe United States C~urt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Texas \nand the other states had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits and satisfied the other requirements for a preliminary injunction.[3] (#_ftn3) \nThe Fifth Circuit concluded that the Department's DAPA policy conflicted with the \n· discretion authorized by Congress. In considering the DAPA program, the court noted \nthat the Immigration and Nationality Act \"flatly does not permit the reclassification \nof millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible \nfor a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\" According to \nthe court, \"DAPA is foreclosed by Congress's careful plan; the program is 'manifestly \ncontrary to the statute' and therefore was properly enjoined.\" \nAlthough the original DACA policy was not challenged in the lawsuit, both the district \nand appellate court decisions relied on factual findings about the implementation of \nthe 2012 DACA memorandum. The Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that DACA \ndecisions were not truly discretionary,[4] (#_ftn4) and that DAPA and expanded DACA \nwould be substantially similar in execution. Both the district court and the Fifth \nCircuit concluded that implementation of the program did not comply with the \nAdministrative Procedure Act because the Department did not implement it through \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's ruling by equally divided vote (4-4).[5] \n(#_ftns) The evenly divided ruling resulted in the Fifth Circuit order being affirmed. The \npreliminary injunction therefore remains in place today. In October 2016, the \nSupreme Court denied a request from DHS to rehear the case upon the appointment \nof a new Justice. After the 2016 election, both parties agreed to a stay in litigation to \nallow the new administration to review these issues. \nOn January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,768, \"Enhancing \nPublic Safety in the Interior of the United States.\" In that Order, the President \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 8\ndirected federal agencies to \"[e]nsure the faithful execution of the immigration laws . \n. . against all removable aliens,\" and established new immigration enforcement \npriorities. On February 20, 2017, then Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly \nissued an implementing memorandum, stating \"the Department no longer will \nexempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\" \nexcept as provided in the Department's June 15, 2012 memorandum establishing \nDACA,[6] (#_ftn6} and the November 20, 2014 memorandum establishing DAPA and \nexpanding DACA.[7] (lt_ftn7} \nOn June 15, 2017, after consulting with the Attorney General, and considering the \nlikelihood of success on the merits of the ongoing litigation, then Secretary John F. \nKelly issued a memorandum rescinding DAPA and the expansion of DACA-but \ntemporarily left in place the June 15, 2012 memorandum that initially created the \nDACA program. \nThen, on June 29, 2017, Texas, along with several other states, sent a letter to \nAttorney General Sessions asserting that the original 2012 DACA memorandum is \nunlawful for the same reasons stated in the Fifth Circuit and district court opinions \nregarding DAPA and expanded DACA. The letter notes that if DHS does not rescind \nthe DACA memo by September 5, 2017, the States will seek to amend the DAPA \nlawsuit to include a challenge to DACA. \nThe Attorney General sent a letter to the Department on September 4, 2017, \narticulating his legal determination that DACA \"was effectuated by the previous \nadministration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with \nno established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation \nthat would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of \nimmigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive \nBranch.\" The letter further stated that because DACA \"has the same legal and \nconstitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that \npotentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\" \nNevertheless, in light of the administrative complexities associated with ending the \nprogram, he recommended that the Department wind it down in an efficient and \norderly fashion, and his office has reviewed the terms on which our Department will \ndo so. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 8\nRescission of the June 15, 2012 DACA Memorandum \nTaking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings in the \nongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is \nclear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated. In the exercise of \nmy authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities, except for \nthe purposes explicitly identified below, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 \nmemorandum. \nRecognizing the complexities associated with winding down the program, the \nDepartment will provide a limited window in which it will adjudicate certain requests \nfor DACA and associated applications meeting certain parameters specified below. \nAccordingly, effective immediately, the Department: \n•  Will adjudicate-on an individual, case-by-case basis-properly filed \npending DACA initial requests and associated applications for Employment \nAuthorization Documents that have been accepted by the Department as of \nthe date of this memorandum. \n•  Will reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization Documents filed after the date of this \nmemorandum. \n•  Will adjudicate-on an individual, case by case basis-properly filed \npending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment \nAuthorization Documents from current beneficiaries that have been accepted \nby the Department as of the date of this memorandum, and from current \nbeneficiaries whose benefits will expire between the date of this \nmemorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by the Department \nas of October 5, 2017. \n•  Will reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization Documents filed outside of the parameters \nspecified above. \n•  Will not terminate the grants of previously issued deferred action or revoke \nEmployment Authorization Documents solely based on the directives in this \nmemorandum for the remaining duration of their validity periods. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-1   Filed 09/11/17   Page 7 of 8\n•  Will not approve any new Form 1-131 applications for advance parole under \nstandards associated with the DACA program, although it will generally honor \nthe stated validity period for previously approved applications for advance \nparole. Notwithstanding the continued validity of advance parole approvals \npreviously granted, CBP will-of course-retain the authority it has always had \nand exercised in determining the admissibility of any person presenting at the \nborder and the eligibility of such persons for parole. Further, USCIS will.----of \ncourse-retain the authority to revoke or terminate an advance parole \ndocument at any time. \n•  Will administratively close all pending Form 1-131 applications for advance \nparole filed under standards associated with the DACA program, and will \nrefund all associated fees. \n•  Will continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny \ndeferred action at any time when immigration officials determine termination \nor denial of deferred action is appropriate. \nThis document is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any \nright or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any \nadministrative, civil, or criminal matter. Likewise, no limitations are placed by this \nguidance·on the otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS. \n[1] (tt_ftnrefl) Significantly, while the DACA denial notice indicates the decision to deny \nis made in the unreviewable discretion of USCIS, USCIS has not been able to identify \nspecific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic \ncategorical criteria as outlined in the June 15, 2012 memorandum, but still had his or \nher application denied based solely upon discretion. \n[2] (#_ftnref2)  Texas v.

As such, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security rescinded the June \n15, 2012 memorandum establishing the DACA program. Please see the Attorney \nGeneral's letter and the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security's memorandum for \nfurther information on how this decision was reached. \nQ2: What is going to happen to current DACA holders? \nA2: Current DACA recipients will be permitted to retain both the period of deferred \naction and their employment authorization documents (EADs) until they expire, \nunless terminated or revoked. DACA benefits are generally valid for two years from \nthe date of issuance. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-2   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 7\nQ3: What happens to individuals who currently have an \ninitial DACA request pending? \nA3:  Due to the anticipated costs and administrative burdens associated with \nrejecting all pending initial requests, USCIS will adjudicate-on an individual, case \nby-case basis-all properly filed DACA initial requests and associated applications for \nEADs that have been accepted as of September 5, 2017. \nQ4: What happens to individuals who currently have a \nrequest for renewal of DACA pending? \nA4: Due to the anticipated costs and administrative burdens associated with rejecting \nall pending renewal requests, USCIS adjudicate- on an individual, case-by-case \nbasis-properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization Documents from current beneficiaries that have been \naccepted as of September 5, 2017, and from current beneficiaries whose benefits will \nexpire between September 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted as of \nOctober 5, 2017. USCIS will reject all requests to renew DACA and associated \napplications for EADs filed after October 5, 2017. \nQ5: Is there still time for current DACA recipients to file \na request to renew their DACA? \nAS: USCIS will only accept renewal requests and associated applications for EADs for \nthe class of individuals described above in the time period described above. \nQ6: What happens when an individual's DACA benefits \nexpire over the course of the_n  ext two years? Will \nindividuals with expired DACA be considered illegally \npresent in the country? \nA6: Current law does not grant any legal status for the class of individuals who are \ncurrent recipients of DACA. Recipients of DACA are currently unlawfully present in the \nU.S. with their removal deferred.  When their period of deferred action expires or is \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-2   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 7\nterminated, their removal wilt no tonger be deferred and they wilt no tonger be \neligible for lawful employment. \nOnly Congress has the authority to amend the existing immigration laws. \nQ7: Once an individual's DACA expires, will their case be \nreferred to ICE for enforcement purposes? \nA7: Information provided to USCIS in DACA requests will not be proactively provided \nto ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings, unless the \nrequester meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to ICE \nunder the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA \n(http://www.uscis.gov/NTA) ). This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or \nrescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be \nrelied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by \nlaw by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter. \nQ8: Will USCIS share the personal information of \nindividuals whose pending requests are denied \nproactively with ICE for enforcement purposes? \nA8: Generally, information provided in DACA requests wilt not be proactively provided \nto other law enforcement entities (including ICE and CBP) for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor poses a risk to national \nsecurity or public safety, or meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear \nor a referral to ICE under the criteria. This policy, which may be modified, \nsuperseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, \nand may not be retied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \nenforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter. \nQ9: Can deferred action received pursuant to DACA be \nterminated before it expires? \nA9: Yes. DACA is an exercise of deferred action which is a form of prosecutoriat \ndiscretion. Hence, OHS will continue to exercise its discretionary authority to \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-2   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 7\nterminate or deny deferred action at any time when immigration officials determine \ntermination or denial of deferred action is appropriate. \nQ10: Can DACA recipients whose valid EAD is lost, stolen \nor destroyed request a new EAD during the phase out? \nAlO: If an individual's still-valid EAD is lost, stolen, or destroyed, they may request a \nreplacement EAD by filing a new Form 1-765. \nQ11: Will DACA recipients still be able to travel outside of \nthe United States while their DACA is valid? \nAll: Effective September 5, 2017, USCIS will no longer approve any new Form 1-131 \napplications for advance parole under standards associated with the DACA program . \n. Those with a current advance parole validity period from a previously-approved \nadvance parole application will generally retain the benefit until it expires. However, \nCBP will retain the authority it has always exercised in determining the admissibility \nof any person presenting at the border. Further, USCIS retains the authority to revoke \nor terminate an advance parole document at any time. \nQ12: What happens to individuals who have pending \nrequests for advance parole to travel outside of the \nUnited States? \nAl2: USCIS will administratively close all pending Form 1-131 applications for \nadvance parole under standards associated with the DACA program, and will refund \nall associated fees. \nQ13: How many DACA requests are currently pending \nthat will be impacted by this change? Do you have a \nbreakdown of these numbers by state? \nAl3: There were 106,341 requests pending as of August 20, 2017 - 34,487 initial \nrequests and 71,854 renewals.  We do not currently have the state-specific breakouts. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-2   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 7\nQ14: Is there a grace period for DACA recipients with \nEADs that will soon expire to make appropriate plans to \nleave the country? \nAl4: As noted above, once an individual's DACA and EAD expire-unless in the limited \nclass of beneficiaries above who are found eligible to renew their benefits-the \nindividual is no longer considered lawfully present in the United States and is not \nauthorized to work.  Persons whose DACA permits will expire between September 5, \n2017 and March 5, 2018 are eligible to renew their permits. No person should lose \nbenefits under this memorandum prior to March 5, 2018 if they properly file a \nrenewal request and associated application for employment authorization. \nQ15: Can you provide a breakdown of how many DACA \nEADs expire in 2017, 2018, and 2019? \nAl5:  From August through December 2017, 201,678 individuals are set to have their \nDACA/EADs expire.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nAlejandro Mayorkas \nDirector, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \nJohn Morton \nDirector, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n~I:_ \n~ \nFROM:  Janet Napolitano  f  J- /)1   \nSecretary of Hamel· ritr3'ccu1.ft/ \nSUBJECT:  Exercising Prose  orial Discretion with Respect to Individuals \nWho Came to the  nited States as Children \nBy this memorandum, I am setting forth how, in the exercise of our prosecutorial discretion, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (OHS) should enforce the Nation's immigration laws against \ncertain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \nhome.  As a general matter, these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law and our ongoing \nreview of pending removal cases is already offering administrative closure to many of them. \nHowever, additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are not \nexpended on these low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet \nour enforcement priorities. \nThe following criteria should be satisfied before an individual is considered for an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion pursuant to this memorandum: \n•  came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n•  has continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding the date of \nthis memorandum and is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum; \n•  is currently in school. has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education \ndevelopment certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or \nAn11ed Forces of the United States; \n•  has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple \nmisdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; \nand \n•  is not above the age of thi11y. \nwww.dhs.gov \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-4   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 4\nOur Nation's immigration laws must be enforced in a strong and sensible manner.  They are not \ndesigned to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of \neach case.  Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they \nmay not have lived or even speak the language.  Indeed, many of these young people have \nalready contributed to our country in significant ways.  Prosecutorial discretion, _which is used in \nso many other areas, is especially justified here. \nAs part of this exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the above criteria are to be considered \nwhether or not an individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of \nremoval.  No individual should receive deferred action under this memorandum unless they first \npass a background check and requests for relief pursuant to this memorandum are to be decided \non a case by case basis.  OHS cannot provide any assurance that relief will be granted in all \ncases. \n1.  With respect to individuals who are encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (lCE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCTS): \n•  With respect to individuals who meet the above criteria, ICE and CBP should \nimmediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis, in order to prevent low \npriority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings or removed from the \nUnited States. \n•  USCIS is instructed to implement this memorandum consistent with its existing guidance \nregarding the issuance of notices to appear. \n1  With respect to individuals who are in removal proceedings but not yet subject to a final order \nof removal, and who meet the above criteria: \n•  ICE should exercise prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis, for individuals who \nmeet the above criteria by deferring action for a period of two years, subject to renewal, \nin order to prevent low priority individuals from being removed from the United States. \n•  ICE is instructed to use its Office of the Public Advocate to pennit individuals who \nbelieve they meet the above criteria to identify themselves through a clear and efficient \nprocess. \n•  !CE is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this \nmemorandum. \n•  ICE is also instructed to immediately begin the process of deferring action against \nindividuals who meet the above criteria whose cases have already been identified through \nthe ongoing review of pending cases before the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview. \n3.  With respect to the individuals who are not currently in removal proceedings and meet the \nabove criteria, and pass a background check: \n•  USCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial \ndiscretion, on an individual basis, by deferring action against individuals who meet the \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-4   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 4\nabove criteria and are at least 15 years old, for a period of two years, subject to renewal, \nin order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings \nor removed from the United States. \n•  The USCIS process shall also be available to individuals subject to a final order of \nremoval regardless of their age. \n•  USC IS is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this \nmemorandum. \nFor individuals who are granted deferred action by either ICE or USCIS, USCIS shall accept \napplications to determine whether these individuals qualify for work authorization during this \nperiod of deferred action. \nThis men1orandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. \nOnly the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for \nthe executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the \nframework of the existing law.

What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals? \nAs the Department of Homeland Security (OHS) continues to focus its enforcement resources on the removal of individuals \nwho pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety, DHS wit! exercise prosecutoriat discretion as appropriate to \nensure that enforcement resources are not expended on low priority cases, such as individuals who came to the United \nStates as children and meet other key guidelines. Individuals who demonstrate that they meet the guidelines below may \nrequest consideration of deferred action for childhood a rrivats (DACA) for a period of two years, subject to renew at for a \nperiod of two years, and may be eligible for employment authorization. \nYou may request consideration of DACA if you: \n1. Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; \n2. Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday; \n3.  Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time; \n4.  Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for \nconsideration of deferred action with USCIS; \n5.

Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a \nGeneral Educational Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or \nArmed Forces of the United States; and \n7. Have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not \notherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. \nIndividuals can call U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) at 1-800-375-5283 with questions or to request \nmore information on DACA. Those with pending requests can also use a number of on line self-helQ tools which include the \nability to check case status and processing times, change your address, and send an inquiry about a case pending longer \nthan posted processing times or non-delivery of a card or document. \nQl: What is deferred action? \nAl: Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial \ndiscretion. For purposes of future inadmissibility based upon unlawful presence, an individual whose case has been \ndeferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred action is in effect. An individual who \nhas received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to \nbe lawfully present during the period deferred action is in effect. However, deferred action does not confer lawful status \nupon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence. \nUnder existing regulations, an individual whose case has been deferred is eligible to receive employment authorization for \nthe period of deferred action, provided he or she can demonstrate \"an economic necessity for employment.\" DHS can \nterminate or renew deferred action at any time, at the agency's discretion. \nQ2: What is DACA? \nA2: On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as \nchildren and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to \nrenewal, and would then be eligible for work authorization. \nIndividuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for \ndeferred action. Determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis under the DACA guidelines. \nQ3: Is there any difference between \"deferred action\" and DACA under this process? \nA3: DACA is one form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives under DACA is identical for immigration purposes \nto the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion. \nQ4: If my removal is deferred under the consideration of DACA, am I eligible for employment authorization? \nA4: Yes. Under existing regulations, if your case is deferred, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided \nyou can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. \nQ5: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral? \nAS: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility \npurposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful status. \nThe fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change whether you are in lawful status while you remain in \nthe United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, your period of stay is \nhttp: //web. archive .o rg/we b/2 017 08 2 414 27 01 /http s: //www.uscis.gov/hu ma ... f erred-a ct ion-chi Id hood-a rri v a Is-process/I req uen t I y-a s ked-q ue st ions  Page 2 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionsC I aUsSCeIS 3  :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nauthorized by the Department of Homeland Security while your deferred action is in effect and, for admissibility purposes, \nyou are considered to be lawfully present in the United States during that time. Individuals granted deferred action are \nnot precluded by federal law from establishing domicile in the U.S. \nApart from the immigration laws, \"lawful presence,\" \"lawful status\" and similar terms are used in various other federal and \nstate laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion \nunder DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state or local authorities. \nQG: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA? \nA6: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. Your request for a renewal will be considered on a case \nby-case basis. If USCIS renews its exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for \nanother two years, and if you demonstrate an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment \nauthorization throughout that period. \nReturn to top. \nB. DACA Process \nQ7: How do I request consideration of DACA? \nA7: To request consideration of DACA (either as an initial request or to request a renewal), you must submit Form 1-8210,. \nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to USCIS.

USCIS will then send you an \nappointme.nt notice to visit an Application Support Center (ASC) for biometric services, if an appointment is required. \nPlease make sure you read and follow the directions in the notice. Failure to attend your biometrics appointment may delay \nprocessing of your request for consideration of deferred action, or may result in a denial of your request. You may also \nchoose to receive an email and/or text message notifying you that your form has been accepted by completing a Form G-\n1145, E-Notification of ApplicationLPetition Acceptance. \nEach request for consideration of DACA will be reviewed on an individual, case-by-case basis. USCIS may request more \ninformation or evidence from you, or request that you appear at a USCIS office.

In addition to establishing that you initially resided in the \nUnited States before you turned 16 years old, you must also have maintained continuous residence in the United States \nfrom June 15, 2007, until the present time to be considered for deferred action under this process. \nQ31: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence \ndocumenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period? \nA31: To meet the continuous residence guideline, you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the \nUnited States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of your request. You should provide documentation to account for as \nmuch of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be \nspecifically accounted for through direct evidence. \nhttp: //web. archive. org/we b /2 O1 708 2 414 2 7 O1  /http s: //www. us cis .gov/ h u ma ... f erred-a ct ion-chi Id h cod -a rriva Is-process/frequently-as ked-q u est ions  Page 8 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs aI sUSeC I3S :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 10 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nIt is helpful to USCIS if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. USCIS will review \nthe documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the \nUnited States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation as to certain periods may raise doubts as to \nyour continued residence if, for example, the gaps are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been \noutside the United States for a period of time that was not brief, casual or innocent. \nIf gaps in your documentation raise questions, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence to allow you to submit additional \ndocumentation that supports your claimed continuous residence. \nAffidavits may be submitted to explain a gap in the documentation demonstrating that you meet the five-year continuous \nresidence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit two or \nmore affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and \ncircumstances during the period as to which there is a gap in the documentation. Affidavits may only be used to explain \ngaps in your continuous residence; they cannot be used as evidence that you meet the entire five-year continuous residence \nrequirement. \nQ32: Does \"currently in school\" refer to the date on which the request for consideration of deferred action is filed? \nA32: To be considered \"currently in school\" under the guidelines, you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a \nrequest for consideration of deferred action under this process. \nQ33: Who is considered to be \"currently in school\" under the guidelines? \nA33: To be considered \"currently in school\" under the guidelines, you must be enrolled in: \n•  a public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, \nalternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; \n•  an education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving \nliteracy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or \nemployment and where you are working toward such placement; or \n•  an education program assisting students either in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent \nunder state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a \nGED exam or other state-authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States. \nSuch education, literacy, career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs assisting students \nin obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other \nstate-authorized exam in the United States, include, but are not limited to, programs funded, in whole or in part, by federal, \nstate, county or municipal grants or administered by non-profit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may \nqualify if they are programs of demonstrated effectiveness. \nIn assessing whether such programs not funded in whole or in part by federal, state, county or municipal grants or \nadministered by non-profit organizations are of demonstrated effectiveness, USCIS will consider the du ration of the . \nprogram's existence; the program's track record in assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its \nrecognized equivalent, in passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (e.g., Hi Set or TASC), or in placing students in \nI \npostsecondary education, job training, or employment; and other indicators of the program's overall quality. For \nindividuals seeking to demonstrate that they are \"currently in school\" through enrollment in such a program, the burden is \non the requestor to show the program's demonstrated effectiveness. \nQ34: How do I establish that I am currently in school? \nA34: Documentation sufficient for you to demonstrate that you are currently in school may include, but is not limited to: \nhttp:/ /web. archive. org/we b /2 01708 2 414 2 701 /http s: / /www. us c is.gov/hum a ... f erred-act ion-chi Id hood -a rriv a Is-p roe es s/ frequently-as ked-q u est ions  Page 9 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs Ia UsSeC IS3 :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 11 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \n•  evidence that you are enrolled in a public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high \nschool or secondary school; alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; or \n•  evidence that you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that: \no  has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in \npostsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; and \no  is funded, in whole or in part, by federal, state, county or municipal grants or is administered by non-profit \norganizations, or if funded by other sources, is a program of demonstrated effectiveness; or \n•  evidence that you are enrolled in an education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency \ndiploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other such state-authorized exam \n[for example, Hi Set or TASC]), and that the program is funded in whole or in part by federal, state, county or municipal \ngrants or is administered by non-profit organizations or if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness. \nSuch evidence of enrollment may include: acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, \ntranscripts, report cards, or progress reports which may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and \ncurrent educational or grade level, if relevant. \nQ35: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated from high school? \nA35: Documentation sufficient for you to demonstrate that you have graduated from high school may include, but is not \nlimited to, a high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school, a certificate of completion, a \ncertificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school, or a recognized \nequivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state \nauthorized exam (e.g., Hi Set or TASC) in the United States. \nQ36: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from \npassing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC)? \nA36: Documentation may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam, or other state \nauthorized exam (e.g., Hi Set or TASC), and, as a result, have received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school \ndiploma under state law. \nQ37: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines? \nA37: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may meet the guidelines if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career \ntraining program'that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in \npostsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs \ninclude, but are not limited to, programs funded, in whole or in part, by federal, state, county or municipal grants or \nad ministered by non-profit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness. \nQ38: If I am enrolled in an English as a Second Language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines? \nA38: Yes, in certain circumstances. Enrollment in an ESL program may be used to meet the guidelines if the ESL program is \nfunded in whole or in part by federal, state, county or municipal grants, or administered by non-profit organizations, or if \nfunded by other sources is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that \nthe program is funded in whole or part by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a non-profit \norganization, or of demonstrated effectiveness. \nQ39: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education \nguidelines? \nA39: No. Evidence not listed in Chart #1 will not be accepted to establish that you are currently in school, have graduated or \nobtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam \nhttp: //web. archive. org/we b /2 01708 2 414 2701/ ht t ps: //www. u sc is. gov/hum ... f erred-act ion-chi Id hood-a r riv a ls-process/frequently-a sked-q u est ions  Page 10 of 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 12 of 24\nFrequently Asked Questions I USCIS  9/7/17, 12:47 AM \n(e.g., Hi Set or TASC).

You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in \nthe United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which, under the facts presented, may give rise to an \ninference of your presence on June 15, 2012 as well. However, evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 will not be \naccepted to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to \nsatisfy that you meet this guideline. \nChart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the initial guidelines for \nconsideration of deferred action under this process.

However, affidavits may be used to support meeting the following guidelines only if the \ndocumentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking: \n•  Demonstrating that you meet the five year continuous residence requirement; and \n•  Establishing that departures during the required period of continuous residence were brief, casual and innocent. \nIf you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit two or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people \nother than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. Should USCIS determine that \nthe affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or the lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of \nthese guidelines, it will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that further evidence must be submitted to demonstrate \nthat you meet these guidelines. \nUSCIS will not accept affidavits as proof of satisfying the following guidelines: \n•  You are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion or other alternate award from high \nschool, have obtained a high school equivalency diploma or certificate (such as by passing the GED exam or other \nstate-authorized exam [for example, Hi Set or TASC]), or are an honorably discharged veteran from the Coast Guard or \nArmed Forces of the United States; \n•  You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012; \n•  You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday; \n•  You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; and \n•  Your criminal history, if applicable. \nIf the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, USCIS will issue a \nRequest for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must do so in \nI \norder to demonstrate that you meet that guideline. \nI \nQ42: Will I be considered to be in unlawful status if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal \npending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012? \nA42: Yes. If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or \nEOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of DACA. \nhttp://web.archive.org/we b/2 017082 414 2701/https://www.uscis.gov/hu m ... f erred-action-child hood-arrivals-process/I requently-asked-questions  Page 13 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs aI UsSeC IS3 :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 15 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nQ43: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012, but violated \nmy immigration status (e.g., by engaging in unauthorized employment, failing to report to my employer, or failing to \npursue a full course of study) before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under this process? \nA43: No, unless the Executive Office for Immigration Review terminated your status by issuing a final order of removal \nagainst you before June 15, 2012. \nQ44: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012 but \"aged out\" \nof my dependent non immigrant status as of June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under this \nprocess? \nA44: Yes.  For purposes of satisfying the \"had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline alone, if you were admitted for \n\"duration of status\" or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012 but \"aged out\" of your dependent \nnonimmigrant status, on or before June 15, 2012, (meaning you turned 21 years old on or before June 15, 2012), you may be \nconsidered for deferred action under this process. \nQ45: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" but my status in SEVIS is listed as terminated on or before June 15, \n2012. May I be considered for deferred action under this process? \nA45: Yes. For the purposes of satisfying the \"\"had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline alone, if your status as of \nJune 15, 2012, is listed as \"terminated\" in SEVIS, you may be considered for deferred action under this process. \nQ46: I am a Canadian citizen who was inspected by CBP but was not issued an 1-94 at the time of admission. May I be \nconsidered for deferred action under this process? \nA46: In general, a Canadian citizen who was admitted as a visitor for business or pleasure and not issued an 1-94, \nArrival/Departure Record, (also known as a \"non-controlled\" Canadian nonimmigrant) is lawfully admitted for a period of \nsix months. For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that he or she \nwas specifically advised that his or her admission would be for a different length of time, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (OHS) will consider for DACA purposes only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of six months. \nTherefore, if OHS is able to verify from its records that your last non-controlled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, \nOHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012 and you may be considered for \ndeferred action under this process. \nQ47: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued an 1-94 at the \ntime of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under this process? \nA47: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, OHS will assume that \nthe BCC holder who was not provided an 1-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible-30 days-unless the \nindividual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that he or she was specifically advised that his or her admission \nwould be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if OHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was \nusing a BCC, you were not issued an 1-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, OHS will \nconsider your non immigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred \naction under this process. \nQ48: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?  ,-\nA48: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are \nunder 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you \nwill not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with \nUSC IS. If action on your case is deferred, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. \nHowever, having action deferred on your case will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence. \nhttp: //web. a re hive. org/we b / 2 01708 24 14 2 7 01 /http s: //www. u sci s. gov/hum ... f erred-a ct ion-chi Id hood -arr iv a Is-process/frequently-as ke d-ques t ions  Page 14 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs aI UsSeC IS3 :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 16 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nReturn to to12.,. \n111. Renewal of DACA \nQ49: When should I file my renewal request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)? \nA49: USCIS strongly encourages you to submit your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) renewal request between \n150 days and 120 days before the expiration date located on your current Form 1-797 DACA approval notice and \nEmployment Authorization Document (EAD). Filing during this window will minimize the possibility that your current period \nof DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. \nUSCIS' current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You may submit an inquiry about the status of \nyour renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. To submit an inquiry on line, please visit \n.!;:;gov.uscis.govf-e-request. \n•  Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited \nto: \no  Failure to appear at an Application Support Center (ASC) for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain \nfingerprints and photographs. No-shows or rescheduling appointments will require additional processing time. \no  Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that \nrequire further vetting. \no  Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence/clarification. \no  Name/date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence/clarification. \no  The renewal submission was incomplete or contained evidence that suggests a requester may not satisfy the \nDACA renewal guidelines and USCIS must send a request for additional evidence or explanation \nQSO: Can I file a renewal request outside the recommended filing period of 150 days to 120 days before my current \nDACA expires? \nA50: USCIS strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 150-120 day filing period to \nminimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. \nRequests received earlier than 150 days in advance will be accepted; however, this could result in an overlap between your \ncurrent DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full two years from the date that \nyour current DACA period expires .. \nIf you file after the recommended filing period (meaning less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires), \nthere is an increased possibility that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you \nreceive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its \nexpiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond one year after your most recent period of \nDACA expired, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request. \nQSl: How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA: \nA51: You may be considered for renewal of DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA (see above) AND \nyou: \n•  Did not depart the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole; \n•  Have continuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was \napproved up to the present time; and \n•  Have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not \nhttp: //web. a re hive .org/we b / 2 017 O8  2 414 2 701 /http s: //www. us c is.gov/hum ... fer red-act ion-child hood-a rriv a I s-p roce s s/f req uentI  y-asked-quest ions  Page 15 of 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 17 of 24\nFrequently Asked Questions I USCIS  9/7/17, 12:47 AM \notherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. \nThese guidelines must be met for consideration of OACA renewal. USCIS retains the ultimate discretion to determine \nwhether deferred action is appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines are met. \nQ52 Do I accrue unlawful presence if I am seeking renewal and my previous period of DACA expires before I receive a \nrenewal of deferred action under DACA? Similarly, what would happen to my work authorization? \nA52: Yes, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will accrue \nunlawful presence for any time between the periods of deferred action unless you are under 18 years of age at the time you \nsubmit your renewal request. \nSimilarly, if your previous period of OACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will not \nbe authorized to work in the United States regardless of your age at time of filing until and unless you receive a new \nemployment authorization document from USCIS. \nQ53. Do I need to provide additional documents when I request renewal of deferred action under DACA? \nA53.  No, unless you have new documents pertaining to removal proceedings or criminal history that you have not already \nsubmitted to USCIS in a previously approved OACA request. USCIS, however, reserves the authority to request at its \ndiscretion additional documents, information or statements relating to a DACA renewal request determination. \nCAUTION: If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form 1-8210, you will be committing a \nfederal felony punishable by a fine, or imprisonment up to five years, or both, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, \nindividuals may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by [aw, and be subject to criminal \nprosecution. \nQ54. If I am no longer in school, can I still request to renew my DACA? \nA54. Yes. Neither Form 1-8210 nor the instructions ask renewal requestors for information about continued school \nenrollment or graduation. The instructions for renewal requests specify that you may be considered for DACA renewal if you \nmet the guidelines for consideration of initial OACA, including the educational guidelines and: \n1.  Did not depart the United States on or after August 15, 2012, without advance parole; \n2.  Have continuously resided in the United States, up to the present time, since you submitted your most recent request \nfor DACA that was approved; and \n3.  Have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors, and are not a threat \nto national security or public safety. \nQSS.  If I iriitially received DACA and was under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, but have since become 31 or older, can \nI still request a DACA renewal? \nASS. Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of OACA as long as you were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012. \nIV. Travel \nQ56: May I travel outside of the United States before I submit an initial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \nrequest or while my initial DACA request remains pending with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)? \nA56: Any unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt your continuous residence \nand you will not be considered for deferred action under this process. Any travel outside of the United States that occurred \non or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012, will be assessed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to \nhttp: //web. archive. org/we b / 2 017 08 2 4142701/ http s: / /www. u sci s. gov/hum ... fer red-action-chi Id hood-a rriv a Is-p races s/f req u en t ly-asked-questions  Page 16 of 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 18 of 24\nFrequently Asked Questions I USCIS  9/7/17, 12:47 AM \ndetermine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent. (See Chart #2.) \nCAUTION: You should be aware that if you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, \nyour departure will likely result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration \nconsequences. \nQ57: If my case is deferred under DACA, will I be able to travel outside of the United States? \nA57: Not automatically. If USCIS has decided to defer action in your case and you want to travel outside the United States, \nyou must apply for advance parole by filing a Form 1-131, AR.R.lication for Travel Document and paying the applicable fee \n($575). USCIS will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you \ndescribe in your request. Generally, USCIS will only grant advance parole if your travel abroad will be in furtherance of: \n•  humanitarian purposes, including travel to obtain medical treatment, attending funeral services for a family member, \nor visiting an ailing relative; \n•  educational purposes, such as semester-abroad programs and academic research, or; \n•  employment purposes such as overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or, training, or meetings with clients \noverseas . \n. Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole. \nYou may not apply for advance parole unless and until USCIS defers action in your case under the consideration of DACA. \nYou cannot apply for advance parole at the same time as you submit your request for consideration of DACA. All advance \nparole requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. \nIf USCIS has deferred action in your case under the DACA process after you have been ordered deported or removed, you \nmay still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above. \nCAUTION: However, for those individuals who have been ordered deported or removed, before you actually leave the \nUnited States, you should seek to reopen your case before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and obtain \nadministrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you \nshould not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or \nremoved, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, your departure \nmay result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you \nhave any questions about this process, you may contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through the local \nICE Office of the Chief Counsel with jurisdiction over your case. \nCAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without first receiving advance parole, your \ndeparture automatically terminates your deferred action under DACA. \nQ58: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement? \nA58: A brief, casual and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. If you were \nabsent from the United States, your absence will be considered brief, casual and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, \nand before Aug. 15, 2012, and: \n1.  The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence; \n2.  The absence was not because of an order of exclusion, deportation or removal; \n3.  The absence was not because of an order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure \nbefore you were placed in exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings; and \n4.  The purpose of the absence and/or your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law. \nhttp: //web.archive .org/web/2017082414 2701 /https://www.uscis.gov/hum ... f erred-action-childhood-arrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions  Page 17 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs aI UsSeC I3S :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 19 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nOnce USCIS has approved your request for DACA, you may file Form 1-131, Application for Travel Document, to request \nadvance parole to travel outside of the United States. \nCAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without first receiving advance parole, your \ndeparture automatically terminates your deferred action under DACA. \nTravel Guidelines (Chart #2) \nTravel Dates  Type of Travel  Does It Affect Continuous Residence \nOn or after June  Brief, casual and  No \n15,2007, but  innocent \nbefore Aug. 15, \n2012 \nFor an extended  Yes \ntime \nBecause of an \norder of exclusion, \ndeportation, \nvoluntary \ndeparture, or \nremoval \nTo participate in \ncriminal activity \nOn or after Aug.

However, if you travel without receiving \nafter receiving  advance parole, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence. \nDACA \nQ59: May I file a request for advance parole concurrently with my DACA package? \nA59: Concurrent filing of advance parole is not an option at this time. OHS is, however, reviewing its policy on concurrent \nfiling of advance parole with a DACA request.  In addition, OHS is also reviewing eligibility criteria for advance parole. If any \nchanges to this policy are made, USCIS will update this FAQ and inform the public accordingly. \nReturn to toP-,. \nV. Criminal Convictions \nQ60: If I have a conviction for a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanors, can I \nreceive an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under this new process? \nA60: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or three or more other \nmisdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of \nmisconduct, you will not be considered for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) except where the Department of \nHomeland Security (OHS) determines there are exceptional circumstances. \nQ61: What offenses qualify as a felony? \nA61: A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. \nQ62: What offenses constitute a significant misdemeanor? \nA62: For the purposes of this process, a significant misdemeanor is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, \none for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less but greater than five days) and that meets \nthe following criteria: \n1.  Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; \nunlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; or, \n2. If not an offense listed above, is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. \nThe sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and therefore does not include a suspended sentence. \nThe time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local \nlaw enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Notwithstanding \nthe above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary one that is made \ntaking into account the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, the absence of the crimina I history outlined above, or its \npresence, is not necessarily determinative, but is a factor to be considered in the unreviewable exercise of discretion. OHS \nretains the discretion to determine that an individual does not warrant deferred action on the basis of a single criminal \noffense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. \nQ63: What offenses constitute a non-significant misdemeanor? \nhttp: //web. archive. o rg /we b/2 017 08 2 414 2 701/ http s: //www. us c is. gov/hum ... fer red-a ct ion-chi Id hood-arriv a I s-p roce s s/f req u en t ly-asked-questions  Page 19 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs aI UsSeC IS3 :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 21 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nA63: For purposes of this process, a non-significant misdemeanor is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law \n(specifically, one for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less but greater than five days) \nand that meets the following criteria: \nl. Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; \ndrug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; and \n2.  Is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not \ninclude any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement \nagency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. \nNotwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary one \nthat is made taking into account the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, the absence of the criminal history outlined \nabove, or its presence, is not necessarily determinative, but is a factor to be considered in the unreviewable exercise of \ndiscretion. \nQ64: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a non-significant \nmisdemeanor that counts towards the \"three or more non-significant misdemeanors\" making me unable to receive \nconsideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under this new process? \nA64: A minor traffic offense will not be considered a misdemeanor for purposes of this process. However, your entire offense \nhistory can be considered along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant \nan exercise of prosecutorial discretion. \nIt is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a significant misdemeanor regardless of the sentence \nimposed. \nQGS: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat? \nA65: If the background check or other information uncovered du ring the review of your request for deferred action indicates \nthat your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, you will not be able to receive \nconsideration for an exercise of prose.cutorial discretion except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances. \nIndicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, \nor participation in activities that threaten the United States. \nQ66: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered felonies or \nmisdemeanors for purpose of this process? \nA66: No. Immigration-related offenses characterized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws will not be \ntreated as disqualifying felonies or misdemeanors for the purpose of considering a request for consideration of deferred \naction under this process. \nQ67: Will DHS consider my expunged or juvenile conviction as an offense making me unable to receive an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion? \nA67: Expunged convictions and juvenile convictions will not automatically disqualify you. Your request will be assessed on a \ncase-by-case basis to determine whether, under the particular circumstances, a favorable exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion is warranted. If yo_u were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, you will be treated as an adult for \npurposes of the DACA process. \nReturn to to[L \nVI.

Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights. \nQ69: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA? \nA69: This process is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case \nbasis, request deferred action from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE) in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice. \nI  . \nQ70: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but \nbelieve they may warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under the June 2011 Prosecutorial Discretion \nMemoranda? \nA70: If USCIS determines that you do not satisfy the guidelines or otherwise determines you do not warrant an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion, then it will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a \nfinal order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion. \nQ71: How should I fill out question 9 on Form 1-765, Application for Employment Authorization? \nA7 1. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a. DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security \nnumbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration. \nQ72: Will there be supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process? \nA72: Yes. USCIS has implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering \nrequests for DACA. \nQ73: Will USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training? \nA73: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training. \nQ74: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at \ngroup assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS? \nA74: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to file a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or \nAccredited Representative when they engage in practice in immigration matters before OHS, either in person or through the \npreparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who \nconsistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however on Feb. 28, 2011, \nUSCIS issued a statement indicating that it does not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners \n(attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney \nor Accredited Representative (Form G-28) in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. OHS is in the \nprocess of issuing a final rule at which time this matter will be reevaluated. \nQ75: When must an individual sign a Form 1-8210 as a preparer? \nA75: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form l-821D, that individual must complete \nPart 5 of the form. \nQ76: If I provide my employee with information regarding his or her employment to support a request for \nconsideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me and/or my \ncompany? \nA76: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their \nemployment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of \ncriminal statutes or widespread abuses. \nhttp://web.archive.org/web/2 017082414 2701 /htt ps://www.uscis.gov/hu m .. .f erred-action-childhood-arrivals-process/I requen t ly-asked-questions  Page 21 of 23 \n\nFrequently Asked QuestionCs Ia UsSeC IS3 :17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 23 of 24 9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nQ77: Can I request consideration for deferred action under this process if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands (CNMI)? \nA77: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from \nthis process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of \nthe CNMI are in most cases unlikely to qualify for the program. You must, among other things, have come to the United \nStates before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007. \nUnder the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of \nimmigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or \nresidence in, the United States for purposes of the DACA process. \nUSCIS has used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address particular humanitarian needs on a case \nby-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of \ndeferred action under this process, except that your entry and/or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before \nNov. 28, 2009, USCIS is willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation \napplies to you, you should make an appointment through INFO PASS with the USCIS ASC in Saipan to discuss your case with \nan immigration officer. \nQ78: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true? \nA78: No. There is no expedited processing for deferred action. Dishonest practitioners may promise to provide you with \nfaster services if you pay them a fee. These people are trying to scam you and take your money.

Please see link for more information. [Selective Service]. \nQSO: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient? \nABO: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if the employer: \n•  Demands that an employee show specific documents or asks for more or different documents than are required to \ncomplete Form 1-9, Emr-loyment Eligibility Verification, or create an E-Verify_ case; or \n•  Rejects documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents that reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the \nemployee, including a work authorization document because it has a future expiration date or because of an \nemployee's prior unauthorized status. \nThe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not \ndiscriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the U.S. These include DACA recipients who have been \ngranted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and \nEmployee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: l -800-237-2515). \nFor more information about unfair employment practices against DACA recipients, please read IER's factsheet in English \n(PDF). or .S.12anish (PDF)..  \nFor additional resources and information about workers' rights, visit www.justice.gov!'.crt!'.worker-information. \nhttp: //web. a re hive. o rg/we b/ 2 017 O8  2 414 2 701 /ht t ps: //www. u sci s. gov/hum ... f erred-action-chi Id hood -arr iva ls-p rocess/f req u en t ly-asked -quest ions  Page 22 of 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-5   Filed 09/11/17   Page 24 of 24\nFrequently Asked Questions I USCIS  9/7/17, 12:47 AM \nReturn to to Re. \nLast Reviewed/Updated: 02/08/2017 \nhttp: //web. a re hive. erg/web /2 017O 8  2 4142  7 01 / ht t ps: //www.u s c is. gov/hum ... fer red-action -chi Id hood-arrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions  Page 23 of 23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-6   Filed 09/11/17   Page 1 of 3\nEXHIBITF \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-6   Filed 09/11/17   Page 2 of 3\nSl'C/t_1/(II)' \nL.S.

()(' 211:i~S \nHomeland \nSecurity \nDecember 30, 20 l 6 \nThe Honorable Judy Chu \nU.S. House of Representatives \nWashington, DC  20515 \nDear Representative Chu: \nOn behalf of the Administration, 1 write in response to the letter you and 110 other \nmembers of Congress sent the President on December 5.  In your letter, you ask us ';to do \neverything within [our] power to safeguard the personal identifying information of DACA \nenrollees.··  We share your concerns. \nToday there are 750,000 young people enrolled in DACA who, when they applied \nfor enrollment, relied on the U.S. government· s representations about the use of their \npersonal identifying information.  Since DACA was announced in 2012, OHS has \nconsistently made clear that information provided by applicants will be collected and \nconsidered for the primary purpose of adjudicating their DACA requests and would be \nsafeguarded from other immigration-related purposes.  More specifically, the \nU.S. government represented to applicants that the personal infonnation they provided will \nnot later be used for immigration enforcement purposes except where it is independently \ndetermined that a case involves a national security or public safety threat, criminal activity, \nfraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance of a notice to appear is required by \nlaw. \nWe believe these representations made by the U.S. government, upon which DACA \napplicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored. \nFor decades, even elating back before DACA, it has been the long-standing and \nconsistent practice of OHS (and its predecessor INS) to use information submitted by \npeople seeking deferred action or other benefits for the I imited purpose of adjudicating \ntheir requests, and not for immigration enforcement purposes except in the kinds of \nspecified circumstances described above.  This was true, for example, under the deferred \naction policies extended to victims of human trafficking, to foreign students affected by \nHurricane Katrina, to battered immigrants under the Violence Against Women Act, and to \nwidows and widowers of American citizens.  Accordingly, people who requested to be \nconsidered under DACA, like those who requested deferred action in the past, have relied \non our consistent practice concerning the information they provide about themselves and \nothers. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-6   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 3\nThe Honorable Judy Chu \nPage2 \nThe U.S. government's practice of adhering to the assurances it makes to applicants \nfor deferred action is also consistent with the way USCIS (and the INS before it) has long \nprotected information submitted by those seeking other benefits or relief.  This includes \nbut is not limited to individuals requesting temporary protected status, deferred enforced \ndeparture, or extended voluntary departure.  In these circumstances, as with deferred action \nrequests, USCIS and INS have abided by a longstanding and consistent practice of using \ninformation to adjudicate specific applications, but not for immigration enforcement \npurposes absent the limited circumstances described above. \nSince DACA began, thousands of Dreamers have been able to enroll in colleges and \nuniversities, complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and \ngive back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and \nentrepreneurs-all on the books.  We continue to benefit as a country from the \ncontributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than \nto contribute to our country and our shared future. \nThe co-signers of your letter will receive separate, identical responses.

It constitutes \nguidance for all Department personnel regarding the enforcement of the immigration laws of the \nUnited States, and is applicable to the activities of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices ( USCIS). As such, it should infonn enforcement and removal activities, detention \ndecisions, admirustrative litigation, budget requests and execution, and strategic planning. \n\"'\"'\"' .tlhs.gov \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-8   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 7\nWith the exception of the June 15, 2012, memorandum entitled ''Exercising Prosecutorial \nDiscretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children,\" and the \nNovember 20, 2014 memorandum entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to Certain Individuals \nWho Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents,\"1 all existing conflicting \ndirectives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and \npriorities for removal are hereby immediately rescinded--to the extent of the conf1ict- including, \nbut not limited to, the November 20, 2014, memoranda entitled \"Policies for the Apprehension, \nDetention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants,\" and \"Secure Communities.'' \nA.  The Department's Enforcement Priorities \nCongress has defined the Department's role and responsibilities regarding the enforcement \nof the immigration laws of the United States. Effective immediately, and consistent with Article \nJI, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and Section 3331 of Title 5, United States Code, \nDepartment personnel shall faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States against \nall removable aliens. \nExcept as specifically noted above, the Department no longer will exempt classes or \ncategories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. In faithfully executing the \nimmigration laws, Department personnel should take enforcement actions in accordance with \napplicable law.  In order to achieve this goal, as noted below, [ have directed ICE to hire l 0,000 \nofficers and agents expeditiously, subject to available resources, and to take enforcement actions \nconsistent with avai !able resources. However, in order to maximize the benefit to public safety, to \nstem unlawful migration and to prevent fraud and misrepresentation,  Department personnel \nshould prioritize for removal those aliens described by Congress in Sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and \n(a)(6)(C), 235(b) and (c), and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). \nAdditionally, regardless of the basis ofremovability, Department personnel should \nprioritize removable aliens who: (I) have been convicted of any criminal offense; (2) have been \ncharged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved; (3) have committed acts which \nconstitute a chargeable criminal offense; ( 4) have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in \nconnection with any official matter before a governmental agency; (5) have abused any program \nrelated to receipt of public benefits; (6) are subject ro a final order ofremoval but have not \ncomplied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (7) in the judgment of an \nimmigration oflicer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.  The Director of \nICE, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of USCIS may, as they determine is appropriate, \nissue further guidance to allocate appropriate resources to prioritize enforcement activities within \nthese categories-for example, by prioritizing enforcement activities against removable aliens \nwho are convicted felons or who are involved in gang activity or drug trafficking. \nI The November 20, 2014, memorandum will be addressed in future guidance. \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-8   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 7\nB.  Strengthening Programs to Facilitate the Efficient and Faithful Execution of the \nImmigration Laws of the United States \nFacilitating the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United \nStates- and prioritizing the Department's resources-requires the use of all available systems and \nenforcement tools by Department personnel. \nThrough passage of the immigration laws, Congress established a comprehensive statutory \nregime to remove aliens expeditiously from the United States in accordance with all applicable \ndue process of law. I determine that the faithful execution of our immigration laws is best \nachieved by using all these statutory authorities to the greatest extent practicable. Accordingly, \nDepartment personnel shall make full use of these authorities. \nCriminal aliens have demonstrated their disregard for the rule of law and pose a threat lo \npersons residing in the United States. As such, criminal aliens are a priority for removal. The \nPriority Enforcement Program failed to achieve its stated objectives, added an unnecessary layer \nof uncertainty for the Department's personnel, and hampered the Department's enforcement of the \nimmigration laws in the interior of the United States. Effective immediately, the Priority \nEnforcement Program is tem1inated and the Secure Communities Program shall be restored. To \nprotect our communities and beller facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal \naliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Department shall eliminate the existing \nForms I-247D, f-247N, and I-247X, and replace them with a new form to more effectively \ncommunicate with recipient law enforcement agencies. However, until such forms are updated \nthey may be used as an interim measure to ensure that detainers may still be issued, as \nappropriate. \nICE's Criminal Alien Program is an effective tool to facilitate the removal of criminal \naliens from the United States, while also protecting our communities and conserving the \nDepartment's detention resources. Accordingly, ICE should devote available resources to \nexpanding the use of the Criminal Alien Program in any willing jurisdiction in the United States. \nTo the maximum extent possible, in coordination with the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview (EOJR), removal proceedings shall be initiated against aliens incarcerated in federal., \nstate, and local conectional facilities under the Institutional Hearing and Removal Program \npursuant to section 238(a) of the INA, and administrative removal processes, such as those under \nsection 238(b) of the INA, shall be used in all eligible cases. \nThe INA § 287(g) Program has been a highly successful force multiplier that allows a \n4ualified state o'r local law enforcement officer to be designated as an ·'immigration officer'' for \npurposes of enforcing federal immigration law. Such officers have the authority to perform all Jaw \nenforcement functions specified in section 287(a) of the INA, including the authority to \ninvestigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain, and conduct searches authorized under the INA, \nunder the direction and supervision of the Department. \nThere are currently 32 law enforcement agencies in 16 states participating in the 287(g) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-8   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 7\nProgram. In previous years, there were significantly more law enforcement agencies participating \nin the 287(g) Program. To the greatest extent practicable, the Director of ICE and Commissioner \nor \nCBP shal I expand the 287(g) Program to include all qualified law enforcement agencies that \nrequest to participate and meet all program requirements. In furtherance of this direction and the \nguidance memorandum, ·'Implementing the President's Border Security and Immigration \nEnforcement Improvements Policies\" (Feb. 20, 2017). the Commissioner of CBP is authorized, in \naddition to the Director of ICE, to accept State services and take other actions as appropriate to \ncarry out immigration enforcement pursuant to section 287(g) of the INA. \nC.  Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion \nUnless otherwise directed, Department personnel may injtiate enforcement actions against \nremovable aliens encountered during the perfom1ance of their official duties and should act \nconsistently with the President's enforcement priorities identified in his Executive Order and any \nfurther guidance issued pursuant to this memorandum. Department personnel have full authority \nto arrest or apprehend an alien whom an immigration officer has probable cause to believe is in \nviolation of the immigration laws. They also have full authority to initiate removal proceedings \nagainst any alien who is subject to removal under any provision of the INA, and to refer \nappropriate cases for criminal prosecution. The Department shall prioritize aliens described in the \nDepartment's Enforcement Priorities (Section A) for arrest and removal. This is not intended to \nremove the individual, case-by-case decisions of immigration officers. \nThe exercise of prosecutorial discretion with regard to any alien who is subject to an-est, \ncriminal prosecution, or removal in accordance with law shall be made on a case-by-case basis in \nconsultation with the head of the field office component, where appropriate, of CBP, ICE, or \nUSC IS that initiated or will initiate the enforcement action, regardless of which entity actually \nfiles any applicable charging documents: CBP Chief Patrol Agent, CBP Director of Field \nOperations, [CE Field Office Director, ICE Special Agent-in-Charge, or the USCIS Field Office \nDirector, Asylum Office Director or Service Center Director. \nExcept as specifically provided in this memorandum, prosecutorial discretion shall not be \nexercised in a manner that exempts or excludes a specified class or category of aliens from \nenforcement of the immigration laws. The General Counsel shall issue guidance consistent with \nthese principles to all attorneys involved in immigration proceedings. \nD.  Establishing the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office \nCriminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents. Often, these \nvictims are not provided adequate infonnation about the offender, the offender's immigration \nr \nstatus, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender. Efforts by ICE to engage \nthese victims have been hampered by prior Department of Homeland Security (OHS) policy \nextending certain Privacy Act protections to persons other than U.S. citizens and lawful \npennanent residents, leaving victims feeling marginalized and without a voice. Accordingly, I am \nestablishing the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office within the Office of \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-8   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 7\nthe Director of ICE, which wi!l create a programmatic liaison between ICE and the known victims \nof crimes committed by removable aliens. The liaison will facilitate engagement with the victims \nand their families lo ensure, to the extent pennitted by law, that they are provided inforination \nabout the offender, including the offender's immigration status and custody status, and that their \nquestions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed. \nTo that end, [ direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources \nthat are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with \na judicial order) lo the new VOlCE Office, and to immediately tenninate the provision of such \noutreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. \nNothing herein may be construed to authorize disclosures that are prohibited by law or \nmay relate to information that is Classified, Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Law Enforcement \nSensitive (LES), For Official Use Only (FOUO), or similarly designated information that may \nrelate to national security, law enforcement, or intelligence programs or operations, or disclosures \nthat are reasonably likely to cause hann to any person. \nE.  Hiring Additional ICE Officers and Agents \nTo enforce the immigration laws effectively in the interior of the United States in \naccordance with the President's directives, additional ICE agents and officers are necessary. The \nDirector of ICE shall-while ensuring consistency i.n training and standards-take all appropriate \naction to expeditiously hire 10,000 agents and officers, as well as additional operational and \nmission support and legal staff necessary to hire and support their activities. Human Capital \nleadership in CBP and ICE, in coordination with the Under Secretary for Management and the \nChief Human Capital Officer, shall develop hiring plans that balance growth and interagency \nattrition by integrating workforce shaping and career paths for incumbents and new hires. \nF.  Establishment of Programs to Collect Authorized Civil Fines and Penalties \nAs soon as practicable. the Director of ICE, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of \nUSCIS shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the \nassessment and collection of all fines and penalties which the Department is authorized under the \nlaw to assess and collect from aliens and from those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the \nUnited States. \nG.  Aligning the Department's Privacy Policies With the Law \nThe Department will no longer afford Privacy /\\ct rights and protections to persons who \nare neither U.S. citizens nor lawful pennanent residents. The DHS Privacy Office will rescind the \nDHS Privacy Policy Guidance memorandum, dated January 7, 2009, which implemented the \nDHS \"mixed systems\" policy of administratively treating all personal information contained in \nDHS record systems as being subject to the Privacy Act regardless of the subject's immigration \nstatus. The OHS Privacy Office, with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel, will \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-8   Filed 09/11/17   Page 7 of 7\ndevelop new guidance specifying the appropriate treatment of personal infom1ation DHS \nmaintains in its record systems. \nH.  Collecting and Reporting Data on Alien Apprehensions and Releases \nThe collection of data regarding aliens apprehended by ICE and the disposition of their \ncases will assist in the development of agency performance metrics and provide transparency in \nthe immigration enforcement mission. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, the Director of \nICE shall develop a standardized method of reporting statistical data regarding aliens apprehended \nby ICE and, at the earliest practicable time, provide monthly reports of such data to the public \nwithout charge. \nThe reporting method shall include uniform terminology and shall utilize a fomiat that is \neasily understandable by the public and a medium that can be readily accessed. At a minimum, in \naddition to statistical information currently being publicly reported regarding apprehended aliens, \nthe following categories of infonnation must be included: country of citizenship, convicted \ncriminals and the nature of their offenses, gang members, prior immigration violators, custody \nstatus of aliens and, if released, the reason for release and location of their release, aliens ordered \nremoved, and aliens physically removed or returned. \nThe 1CE Director shall also develop and provide a weekly report to the public, utilizing a \nmedium that can be readily accessed without charge, of non-Federal jurisdictions that release \naliens from their custody, notwithstanding that such aliens are subject to a detainer or similar \nrequest for custody issued by JCE to that jurisdiction. In addition to other relevant information, to \nthe extent that such information is readily available, the report shall reflect the name of the \njurisdiction, the citizenship and immigration status of the alien, the arrest, charge, or conviction \nfor which each alien was in the custody of that jurisdiction, the date on which the ICE detainer or \nsimilar request for custody was served on the jurisdiction by ICE, the date of the alien's release \nfrom the custody of that jurisdiction and the reason for the release, an explanation concerning why \nthe detainer or similar request for custody was not honored, and all arrests, charges, or convictions \noccurring after the alien's release from the custody of that jurisdiction. \nI. No Private Right of Action \nThis document provides only internal DHS policy guidance, which may be modified, \nrescinded, or superseded at any time without notice. This guidance is not intended to, does not, \nand may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at \nlaw by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter. Likewise, no limitations are \nplaced by this guidance on the otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS. \nIn implementing these policies, [ direct DHS Components to consult with legal counsel to \nensure compliance with all applicable laws, including the Administrative Procedure Act. \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-9   Filed 09/11/17   Page 1 of 2\nEXHIBIT I \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-9   Filed 09/11/17   Page 2 of 2\nQl)ffice of tl7e 1\\ttorne~ ~eneral \nm. \n1Jl!Jngqingtott,  <!I. 20,5.30 \nDear Acting Secretary Duke, \nI write to advise that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should rescind the \nJune 15, 2012, DHS Memorandum entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children,\" as well as any related memoranda or \nguidance.  This policy, known as \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" (DACA), allows \nce11ain individuals who are without lawful status in the United States to request and receive a \nrenewable, two-year presumptive reprieve from removal, and other benefits such as work \nauthorization and participation in the Social Security program. \nDACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without \nproper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.  Such an open-ended \ncircumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the \nExecutive Branch.  The related Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent \nResidents (DAPA) policy was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth \nCircuit on the basis of multiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally \ndivided vote.  See Texas v.  United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 669-70 (S.D. Tex.), ajf'd, 809 F.3d \n134, 171-86 (5th Cir. 2015), afj'd by equally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016).  Then \nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly rescinded the DAP A policy in June.  Because the \nDACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to \nDAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to \nDACA. \nIn light of the costs and burdens that will be imposed on DHS associated with rescinding \nthis policy, DHS should consider an orderly and efficient wind-down process. \nAs Attorney General of the United States, I have a duty to defend the Constitution and to \nfaithfully execute the laws passed by Congress.  Proper enforcement of our immigration laws is, \nas President Trump consistently said, critical to the national interest and to the restoration of the \nrule of law in our country.  The Department of Justice stands ready to assist and to continue to \nsupport DHS in these important efforts. \nL \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 1 of 34\nEXHIBIT J \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 2 of 34\nThe Department of Homeland Security's Authority to \nPrioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present \nin the United States and to Defer Removal of Others \nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed policy to prioritize the removal of certain aliens \nunlawfully present in the United States would be a permissible exercise of DHS's discretion to \nenforce the immigration laws. \nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed deterred action program for parents of U.S. citizens \nand legal permanent residents would also be a permissible exercise of DHS's discretion to enforce \nthe immigration laws. \nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed deferred action program for parents of recipients of \ndeferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would not be a permissi \nble exercise ofDHS's enforcement discretion. \nNovember 19, 2014 \nMEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY \nAND THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT \nYou  have asked two  questions concerning the scope of the  Department of \nHomeland Security's discretion to enforce the immigration laws. First, you have \nasked  whether,  in  light  of the  limited  resources  available  to  the  Department \n(\"DHS\") to remove aliens unlawfully present in the United States,  it would be \nlegally  permissible  for the  Department ·to  implement  a  policy  prioritizing  the \nremoval  of certain  categories  of aliens  over others.  DHS  has  explained  that \nalthough there are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the. country, \nit has the resources to remove fewer than 400,000 such aliens each year.  DHS's \nproposed policy would prioritize the removal of aliens who present threats to \nnational security, public safety, or border security. Under the proposed policy, \nOHS officials could remove an alien who did not fall into one of these categories \nprovided  that an  Immigration  and Customs  Enforcement (\"ICE\") Field Office \nDirector determined  that \"removing  such  an  alien  would  serve  an  important \nfederal interest.\" Draft Memorandum for Thomas S. Winkowski, Acting Director, \nICE, et al.,  from  Jeh  Charles Johnson,  Secretary of Homeland  Secmity,  Re: \nPolicies  for  the  Apprehension,  Detention,  and  Removal  of Undocumented \nImmigrants at 5 (Nov. 17, 2014) (\"Johnson Prioritization Memorandum\"). \nSecond, you have asked whether it would be permissible for OHS to extend \ndeferred action, a form of temporary administrative relief from removal, to certain \naliens who are the  parents of children  who  are  present  in  the  United  States. \nSpecifically, OHS has proposed to implement a program under which an alien \ncould apply for, and would be eligible to receive, deferred action ifhe or she is not \na  OHS  removal  priority  under the  policy  described  above; has continuously \nresided in the United States since before January I, 20 IO; has a child who is either \na U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident; is physically present in the United \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 34\nOpinions of1he Office ofL egal Counsel in Volume 38 \nStates both when OHS announces its program and at the time of application for \ndeferred action; and presents \"no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, \nmake[] the grant of deferred action inappropriate.\" Draft Memorandum for Leon \nRodriguez, Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al., from Jeh \nCharles Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial \nDiscretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children \nand Others at 4 (Nov. 17, 2014) (\"Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum\"). You \nhave also asked whether OHS could implement a similar program for parents of \nindividuals  who have received  deferred  action  under  the  Deferred  Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program. \nAs has historically been true of deferred action, these proposed deferred action \nprograms would not \"legalize\" any aliens who are unlawfully present in the United \nStates: DefeITed action does not confer any lawful immigration status, nor does it \nprovide a path to obtaining permanent residence or citizenship. Grants of deferred \naction under the proposed programs would, rather, represent DHS's decision not \nto seek an alien's removal for a prescribed period of time. See generally Reno v. \nAm.-Arab  Anti-Discrim.  Comm.,  525  U.S.  471,  483-84  (1999)  (describing \ndeferred action). Under decades-old regulations promulgated pursuant to authority \ndelegated by Congress, see 8 U.S.C.  §§ I 103(a)(3), 1324a(h)(3), aliens who are \ngranted deferred action-like certain other categories of aliens who do not have \nlawful immigration status, such as asylum applicants-may apply for authoriza \ntion  to  work  in  the  United  States  in  certain  circumstances,  8 C.F.R. \n§ 274a.12(c)(14) (providing that defmed action recipients may apply for work \nauthorization if they can show an \"economic necessity for employment\"); see also \n8 C.F.R. § 109.l(b)(7) (1982). Under OHS policy guidance, a grant of deferred \naction also suspends  an  alien's accrual  of unlawful  presence for  purposes of \n8 U.S.C.  § l 182(a)(9)(B)(i)  and  (a)(9)(C)(i)(I),  provisions  that  restrict  the \nadmission  of aliens  who  have departed  the United  States  after  having  been \nLmlawfully present for specified periods of time. A grant of deferred action under \nthe proposed programs would remain in effect for three years, subject to renewal, \nand could be terminated at any time at DHS's discretion. See Johnson Deferred \nAction Memorandum at 2, 5. \nFor the reasons discussed below, we conclude that DHS's proposed prioritiza \ntion policy and its proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens \nand lawful permanent residents would be permissible exercises of OHS 's discre \ntion to enforce the immigration laws. We further conclude that, as  it has been \ndescribed  to  us, the  proposed deferred  action  program  for  parents of DACA \nrecipients would not be a permissible exercise of enforcement discretion. \nI. \nWe first address OHS 's authority to prioritize the removal of certain categories \nof aliens over others. We begin by discussing some of the sources and limits of \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 34\nDHS 's Authority lo Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unla1~(ully Present \nDHS's enforcement  discretion  under the  immigration  laws,  and  then  analyze \nDHS's proposed prioritization policy in light of these considerations. \nA. \nDHS's authority to remove aliens from the United States rests on the Immigra \ntion and Nationality Act of 1952 (\"INA\"), as amended, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq. In \nthe INA, Congress established a comprehensive scheme governing immigration \nand  naturalization.  The  INA  specifies  certain  categories  of aliens  who  are \ninadmissible to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182. It also specifies \"which \naliens may be removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so.\" \nArizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012). \"Aliens may be removed if \nthey were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, \nor meet other criteria set by federal law.\" Id (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1227); see 8 U.S.C. \n§ l 227(a) (providing that \"[a]ny alien ... in and admitted to the United States \nshall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien\" falls within \none or more classes of deportable aliens); see also 8 U.S.C. § l l 82(a) (listing \nclasses of aliens ineligible to receive visas or be admitted to the United States). \nRemoval proceedings ordinarily take place in federal immigration courts adminis \ntered  by  the  Executive  Office for  Immigration  Review,  a  component  of the \nDepattment of Justice. See id § l 229a (governing removal proceedings); see also \nid  §§ l 225(b )( I )(A),  l 228(b)  (setting  out  expedited  removal  procedures  for \nce1tain arriving aliens and certain aliens convicted of aggravated felonies). \nBefore 2003, the Department of Justice, through the Immigration and Naturali \nzation  Service (\"INS\"), was also responsible  for providing immigration-related \nadministrative services and  generally enforcing  the  immigration  laws.  In the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No.  I 07-296, 116 Stat. 2135, Congress \ntransferred most of these functions to OHS, giving it primary responsibility both \nfor initiating removal proceedings and for carrying out final orders of removal. See \n6 U.S.C. §§ 101 el seq.; see also Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 374 n.l (2005) \n(noting that  the  immigration  authorities  previously exercised  by  the  Attorney \nGeneral and INS \"now reside\" in the Secretary of Homeland Security and OHS). \nThe Act divided INS's functions among three different agencies within DHS: U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), which oversees legal immigra \ntion into the United States and provides immigration and naturalization services to \naliens; ICE, which enforces federal laws governing customs, trade, and immigra \ntion;  and  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection (\"CBP\"), which  monitors and \nsecures the nation's borders and ports of entry. See Pub. L. No. I 07-296, §§ 403, \n442, 451, 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178, 2193, 2195, 2205; see also Name Change \nFrom the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services to U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, 69 Fed. Reg. 60938, 60938 (Oct.  13, 2004); Name Change \nof Two  DHS Components,  75  Fed.  Reg.  12445,  12445  (Mar.  16,  20 I 0). The \nSecretary of Homeland Security is thus now \"charged with the administration and \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 34\nOpinions oft he O.ffice of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \nenforcement of [the  INA]  and all  other laws  relating  to  the  immigration and \nnaturalization of aliens.\" 8 U.S.C. § l 103(a)(l). \nAs a general rule, when Congress vests enforcement authority in an executive \nagency, that agency has the discretion to decide whether a pa1ticular violation of \nthe law warrants prosecution or other enforcement action. This discretion is rooted \nin  the President's constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted,\" U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and it reflects a recognition that the \"faithful[]\" \nexecution of the law does not necessarily entail \"act[ing] against each technical \nviolation of the statute\" that an agency is  charged with enforcing. Heckler  v. \nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831  (1985). Rather, as the Supreme Court explained in \nChaney, the decision whether to initiate enforcement proceedings is a complex \njudgment that calls on the agency to \"balanc[e ] ... a number of factors which are \npeculiarly  within  its  expertise.\"  Id  These  factors  include  \"whether  agency \nresources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely \nto succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits \nthe agency's overall policies, and ... whether the agency has enough resources to \nunde1take the action at all.\" Id at 831; cf United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. \n456, 465 ( 1996) (recognizing that exercises of prosecutorial discretion in criminal \ncases  involve consideration of '\"[s]uch factors as the strength of the case, the \nprosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, \nand  the  case's  relationship  to  the  Government's  overall  enforcement  plan\"' \n(quoting Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985))). In Chaney, the Cou1t \nconsidered and rejected a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration's refusal \nto  initiate  enforcement  proceedings  with  respect  to  alleged violations of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, concluding that an agency's decision not \nto initiate enforcement proceedings is presumptively immune from judicial review. \nSee 470 U.S. at 832. The Court explained that, while Congress may \"provide[] \nguidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers,\" in the \nabsence of such \"legislative direction,\" an agency's non-enforcement determina \ntion is, much like a prosecutor's decision not to indict, a \"special province of the \nExecutive.\" Id. at 832-33. \nThe principles of enforcement discretion discussed in Chaney apply with par \nticular force in the context of immigration. Congress enacted the INA against a \nbackground understanding that immigration is \"a field where flexibility and the \nadaptation of the congressional policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute \nthe essence of the program.\" United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. \n537, 543 ( 1950) (internal quotation marks omitted). Consistent with this under \nstanding, the INA vested the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity) with  broad  authority  to  \"establish  such  regulations; ...  issue such \ninstructions; and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out \nhis authority\" under the statute. 8 U.S.C. § l 103(a)(3). Years later, when Congress \ncreated  the Department of Homeland  Security, it expressly  charged DHS with \nresponsibility for \"[e  ]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies and \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 34\nDHS 's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlaw(ilily Present \npriorities.\" Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No.  I 07-296, § 402(5), 116 \nStat. 2135, 2178 ( codified at 6 U.S.C. § 202(5)). \nWith respect to removal decisions in particular, the Supreme Court has recog \nnized that \"the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials\" is a \"principal \nfeature of the removal system\" under the INA. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. The \nINA expressly authorizes immigration officials to grant certain fo1111s of discre \ntionary relief from removal for aliens, including parole, 8 U .S.C. § I l 82(d)(5)(A); \nasylum, id.  § I l 58(b )( I )(A); and cancellation of removal, id.  § l229b.  But in \naddition to adininistering these statutory forms of relief, \"[f]ederal officials, as an \ninitial  matter, must decide whether it  makes sense  to pursue removal at all.\" \nArizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. And, as the Court has explained, \"[a]t each stage\" of \nthe  removal  process-\"commenc[ing]  proceedings,  adjudicat[ing]  cases,  [and] \nexecut[ing] removal orders\"- immigration officials have \"discretion to abandon \nthe endeavor.\" Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. at 483 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \n§ l 252(g) (alterations in original)). Deciding whether to pursue removal at each of \nthese stages implicates a wide range of considerations. As the Court observed in \nArizona: \nDiscretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immedi \nate human concerns.  Unauthorized workers ttying to supp01i  their \nfamilies, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or \naliens who commit a  serious crime. The equities of an individual \ncase may turn on many factors, including whether the alien has chil \ndren born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a rec \nord of distinguished military servi.ce. Some discretiona1y decisions \ninvolve policy choices that bear on this Nation's international rela \ntions . ... The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in \npolitical persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk \nthat the alien or his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic \nnature  of relations  with  other  countries  requires  the  Executive \nBranch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this \nNation's foreign policy with respect to these and other realities. \n132 S. Ct. at 2499. \nImmigration officials' discretion in enforcing the laws is not, however, unlim \nited. Limits on enforcement discretion are both implicit in, and fundamental to, the \nConstitution's  allocation  of governmental  powers  between  the  two  political \nbranches. See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587-\n88 ( 1952). These limits, however, are not clearly defined. The open-ended nature \nof the  inquiry under  the Take Care Clause-whether a  particular exercise of \ndiscretion  is \"faithful[]\" to the  law enacted by Congress--does not lend itself \neasily to the application of set formulas or bright-line rules. And because the \nexercise of enforcement discretion generally is not subject to judicial review, see \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 7 of 34\nOpinions o/ rhe Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \nChaney, 4 70  U.S. at 831-33, neither the Supreme Court nor the lower federal \ncou11s  have  squarely  addressed  its  constitutional  bounds.  Rather,  the political \nbranches have addressed the proper allocation of enforcement authority through \nthe political process. As the Court noted  in  Chaney, Congress \"may limit an \nagency's exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive \npriorities,  or by  otherwise  circumscribing  an  agency's  power  to  discriminate \namong issues or cases it will pursue.\" Id. at 833. The history of immigration policy \nillustrates this principle: Since the INA was enacted, the Executive Branch has on \nnumerous occasions exercised discretion to extend various fonns of immigration \nrelief to categories of aliens for humanitarian, foreign policy, and other reasons. \nWhen Congress has been dissatisfied with Executive action, it has responded, as \nChaney suggests, by enacting  legislation to  limit the  Executive's discretion  in \nenforcing the immigration laws.1 \nNonetheless, the nature of the Take Care duty does point to at least four general \n(and closely related) principles governing the permissible scope of enforcement \ndiscretion  that  we  believe  are  particularly  relevant  here.  First,  enforcement \ndecisions  should  reflect  \"factors  which  are  peculiarly  within  [the  enforcing \nagency's]  expertise.\"  Chaney,  470  U.S.  at  83 l.  Those  factors  may  include \nconsiderations  related  to  agency  resources, such  as \"whether the  agency  has \nenough resources to unde11ake the action,\" or \"whether agency resources ·are best \nspent on this violation or another.\" Id. Other relevant considerations may include \n\"the proper ordering of (the agency's] priorities,\" id.  at 832, and the agency's \nassessment of \"whether the pat1icular enforcement action [at issue] best fits the \nagency's overall policies,\" id. at 831. \nSecond, the Executive cannot, under the guise of exercising enforcement dis \ncretion, attempt to effectively rewrite the laws to match its policy preferences. See \nid.  at 833 (an agency may not \"disregard  legislative direction  in the statutory \nscheme that [it] administers\"). In other words, an agency's enforcement decisions \nshould  be  consonant  with,  rather  than  contrary  to,  the  congressional  policy \nunderlying the statutes the agency is charged with administering. Cf Youngstown, \n343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring) (\"When the President takes measures \nincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \nlowest ebb.\"); Nat'/ Ass'n of Home Builders v.  Defenders of Wildlife, 551  U.S. \n644, 658 (2007) (explaining that where Congress has given an agency the power to \nadminister a statutory scheme, a court will not vacate the agency's decision about \nthe proper administration of the statute unless, among other things, the agency \n'\"has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider\"' (quoting \nI See, e.g., Adam B. Cox & Cristina M. Rodriguez, The Presidenr and /111111igration law, 119 Yale \nL.J. 458, 503-05 (2009) (describing Congress's response to its dissatisfaction with the Executive's use \nof parole power for refugee populations in the 1960s and 1970s): see also, e.g., infra note 5 (discussing \nlegislative limitations on voluntary departure and extended voluntary departure). \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 8 of 34\nDHS's Aulhority to Prioritize Removal o/Cerlain Aliens Unlawfully Presenl \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. Stale Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 ( 1983))). \nThird, the Executive Branch ordinarily cannot, as the Court put it in Chaney, \n\"'consciously and expressly adopt(] a general policy'  that is  so extreme as to \namount to an abdication of its statutory  responsibilities.\" 470 U.S. at 833  n.4 \n(quoting Adams v.  Richardson, 480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en bane)); \nsee id.  (noting that in situations where an agency had adopted such an extreme \npolicy, \"the statute conferring authority on the agency might indicate that such \ndecisions were not 'committed to agency discretion\"'). Abdication of the duties \nassigned to the agency by statute is ordinarily incompatible with the constitutional \nobligation to faithfully execute the laws. But see,  e.g., Presidential Authority to \nDecline lo  Execute  Unconstitutional Statutes,  18  Op. O.L.C.  199, 200 (1994) \n(noting that under the Take Care Clause, \"the President  is  required  to act  in \naccordance with the  laws- including the Constitution, which takes precedence \nover other forms of law\"). \nFinally, lower courts, following Chaney, have indicated that non-enforcement \ndecisions are most comfortably characterized as judicially unreviewable exercises \nof enforcement discretion when they are made on a case-by-case basis. See, e.g., \nKenney v. Glickman,  96 F.3d  1118,  1123  (8th Cir.  1996); Crowley Caribbean \nTransp.,  Inc.  v.  Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 676-77 (D.C.  Cir.  1994). That reading of \nChaney reflects a conclusion that case-by-case enforcement decisions generally \navoid the concerns mentioned above. Courts have noted that \"single-shot non \nenforcement decisions\" almost inevitably rest on \"the sort of mingled assessments \nof fact, policy, and law ... that are, as Chaney recognizes, peculiarly within the \nagency's expe1tise and discretion.\" Crowley Caribbean Transp., 37 F.3d at 676-\n77 ( emphasis omitted).  Individual enforcement decisions made on the  basis of \ncase-specific factors are also unlikely to constitute \"general polic[ies] that [are] so \nextreme as to amount to an abdication of[the agency's] statutory responsibilities.\" \nId.  at 677 (quoting Chaney, 477 U.S. at 833  n.4). That does not mean that all \n\"general policies\" respecting non-enforcement are categorically forbidden: Some \n\"general policies\" may,  for  example,  merely provide a framework for  making \nindividualized, discretionary assessments about whether to  initiate enforcement \nactions in particular cases. Cf Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 313 ( 1993) (explain \ning that an agency's use of \"reasonable presumptions and generic rules\"  is not \nincompatible with a requirement to  make individualized dete1111inations). But a \ngeneral policy of non-enforcement that forecloses the exercise of case-by-case \ndiscretion poses \"special risks\"  that the agency has exceeded the bounds of its \nenforcement discretion. Crowley Caribbean Transp., 37 F.3d at 677. \nB. \nL \nWe now turn, against this backdrop, to DHS's proposed prioritization policy. In \ntheir exercise of enforcement discretion, DHS and its predecessor, fNS, have long \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 9 of 34\nOpinions of/he Office ofL egal Counsel in Volume 38 \nemployed guidance instructing immigration officers to prioritize the enforcement \nof the immigration laws against certain categories of aliens and to deprioritize \ntheir  enforcement  against  others.  See.  e.g.,  fNS  Operating  Instructions \n§ I 03(a)( J.)(i) ( I 962); Memorandum for All Field Office Directors, ICE, et al., \nfrom  John  Morton,  Director,  ICE,  Re:  Exercising  Prosecutorial  Discretion \nConsistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities oft he Agency for the \nApprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens (June 17, 2011 ); Memorandum \nfor All ICE Employees, from John Morton, Director, ICE, Re: Civil Immigration \nEnforcement: Priorities for the Apprehension,  Detention, and Removal of Aliens \n(Mar. 2, 20 l I); Memorandum  for  Regional  Directors,  fNS, et al., from Doris \nMeissner, Commissioner, fNS, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion (Nov. I 7, \n2000). The policy DHS proposes, which is similar to but would supersede earlier \npolicy guidance, is designed to \"provide clearer and more effective guidance in the \npursuit\"  of DHS's enforcement priorities; namely, \"threats to national security, \npublic safety and border security.\" Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at I. \nUnder the proposed policy, OHS would identify  three categories of undocu \nmented aliens who would be priorities for removal from the United States. See \ngenerally id at 3-5. The highest priority category would include aliens who pose \npa1ticularly serious threats to national security, border security, or public safety, \nincluding aliens engaged in or suspected of espionage or terrorism, aliens convict \ned of offenses related to pa1ticipation in criminal street gangs, aliens convicted of \ncertain felony offenses, and aliens apprehended at the border while attempting to \nenter the United States unlawfully. See id. at 3. The second-highest priority would \ninclude aliens convicted of multiple or significant misdemeanor offenses; aliens \nwho are  apprehended after  unlawfully entering the  United  States who  cannot \nestablish that they  have  been  continuously  present  in the United States since \nJanuary  I, 2014; and aliens determined to have significantly abused the visa or \nvisa waiver programs. See id. at 3-4. The third priority category would include \nother aliens who have been issued a final order of removal on or after January I, \n2014. See id. at 4. The policy would also provide that none of these aliens should \nbe prioritized for removal if they \"qualify for asylum or another form of relief \nunder our laws.\" Id at 3-5. \nThe policy would instruct that resources should be directed to these priority \ncategories in a manner \"commensurate with the level of prioritization identified.\" \nId.  at 5. It would, however, also leave significant room for immigration officials to \nevaluate the circumstances of individual cases. See id.  (stating that the policy \n''requires OHS personnel to exercise discretion based on individual circumstanc \nes\").  For example, the policy would pennit an ICE Field Office Director, CSP \nSector Chief, or CSP Director of Field Operations to deprioritize the removal of \nan alien  falling  in  the highest priority category if, in her judgment, \"there are \ncompelling and exceptional factors that clearly indicate the alien is not a threat to \nnational security, border security, or public safety and should not therefore be an \nenforcement priority.\" Id at 3.  Similar discretionary provisions would apply to \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 10 of 34\nDHS 's Aulhority lo Priorilize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlawfully Presenl \naliens in the second and third priority categories.2 The policy would also provide a \nnon-exhaustive list of factors OHS personnel should  consider in making such \ndeprioritization judgments.' In addition, the policy would expressly state that its \nterms  should  not  be  construed  \"to  prohibit  or  discourage  the  apprehension, \ndetention, or removal of aliens  w1lawfully  in  the  United  States who  are not \nidentified as priorities,\" and would further provide that \"[i)mmigration officers \nand attorneys may pursue removal of an alien not identified as a priority\" if, \"in \nthe judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, removing such an alien would serve \nan important federal interest.\" ld. at 5. \nOHS has explained that the proposed policy is designed to respond to the prac \ntical reality that the number of aliens who are removable under the fNA vastly \nexceeds the resources Congress has made available to OHS for processing and \ncarrying out removals. The resource constraints are striking. As noted, OHS has \ninfonned us that there are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the \ncountry, but that Congress has appropriated sufficient resources for ICE to remove \nfewer  than  400,000  aliens  each  year,  a  significant  percentage  of whom  are \ntypically encountered  at  or  near the  border rather than  in  the  interior of the \ncountly. See E-mail for Karl R. Thompson, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral,  Office  of Legal  Counsel,  from  David  Shahoulian,  Deputy  General \nCounsel, OHS, Re: Immigration Opinion (Nov. 19, 2014) (\"Shahoulian E-mail\"). \nThe proposed policy explains that, because OHS \"cannot respond to all immigra \ntion violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States,\" it seeks to \n\"prioritize the use of enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets\" \nto \"ensure that use of its limited resources is devoted to the pursuit of' OHS's \nhighest priorities. Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 2. \nIn our view, OHS's proposed prioritization policy falls within the scope of its \nlawful discretion to enforce the immigration laws. To begin with, the policy is \nbased on a factor clearly \"within [DHS's] expertise.\" Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. \nFaced with sharply limited resoui·ces, OHS necessarily must make choices about \nwhich removals to pursue and which removals to defer.  OHS's organic statute \nitself recognizes this inevitable fact, instructing the Secretary to establish \"national \n2 Under the proposed policy, aliens in the second tier could be deprioritized if, \"in the judgment of \nan ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief, CBP Director of Field Operations, USCIS District \nDirector, or USCIS Service Center Director, there are factors indicating the alien is not a threat to \nnational  security, border security, or public safety, and should not  therefore  be an  enforcement \npriority.\" Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 4. Aliens in the third tier could be deprioritized if, \"in \nthe judgment of an immigration officer, the alien is not a threat to the integrity of the immigration \nsystem or there are factors suggesting the alien should not be an enforcement priority.\" Id. at 5. \nl \n·1 These factors include \"extenuating circumstances involving the offense of conviction; extended \nlength of time since the offense of conviction; length of time in the United States; military service; \nfamily or community ties in the United States; status as a victim, witness or plaintiff in civil or criminal \nproceedings; or compelling humanitarian factors such as poor health, age, pregnancy, a young child or \na seriously ill relative.\" Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 6. \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 11 of 34\nOpinions of1he Office o_(Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \nimmigration  enforcement policies  and  priorities.\"  6  U.S.C.  § 202(5).  And  an \nagency's need to ensure that scarce enforcement resources are used in an effective \nmanner  is  a  quintessential  basis  for  the  use of prosecutorial  discretion.  See \nChaney, 470 U.S.  at 831  (among the  factors \"peculiarly within [an agency's] \nexpertise\"  are \"whether agency  resources  are  best spent on  this  violation or \nanother\" and \"whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at \nall\"). \nThe policy OHS has proposed, moreover, is consistent with the removal priori \nties established  by  Congress.  In  appropriating  funds  for  OHS's enforcement \nactivities- which, as noted, are sufficient to permit the removal of only a fraction \nof the undocumented aliens currently in the country-Congress has directed OHS \n· to \"prioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the \nseverity of that crime.\" Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n2014, Pub. L. No. 113-76, div. F, tit. II,  128 Stat. 5, 251  (\"OHS Appropriations \nAct\"). Consistent with this directive, the proposed policy prioritizes individuals \nconvicted of criminal offenses involving active participation in a criminal street \ngang, most offenses classified as felonies in the convicting jurisdiction, offenses \nclassified  as  \"aggravated  felonies\"  under  the  INA,  and  certain  misdemeanor \noffenses.  Johnson Prioritization  Memorandum  at  3-4. The policy  ranks these \npriority categories according to the severity of the crime of conviction. The policy \nalso  prioritizes the removal of other categories of aliens who pose threats to \nnational security or border security, matters about which Congress has demon \nstrated  particular  concern.  See,  e.g.,  8 U .S.C.  § 1226( c)( I )(0) (providing  for \ndetention of aliens charged with removability on national security grounds); id. \n§ l 225(b) &  (c) (providing for an expedited removal process for certain aliens \napprehended at the border). The policy thus raises no concern that OHS has relied \n\"on factors which Congress had· not intended it to consider.\" Nat 'l Ass 'n of Home \nBuilders, 551 U.S. at 658. \nFurther, although the proposed policy  is not a \"single-shot non-enforcement \ndecision,\" neither does it amount to an abdication of DHS 's statutory responsibili \nties, or constitute a legislative rule overriding the commands of the substantive \nstatute.  Crowley Caribbean Transp., 37 F.3d  at 676-77. The proposed policy \nprovides a general framework for exercising enforcement discretion in individual \ncases, rather than establishing an absolute, inflexible policy of not enforcing the \nimmigration laws in ce1tain categories of cases. Given that the resources Congress \nhas allocated to DHS are sufficient to remove only a small fraction of the total \npopulation  of undocumented  aliens  in  the  United States,  setting fo1th  written \nguidance about how resources  should presumptively be allocated in  particular \ncases is a reasonable means of ensuring that DHS's severely limited resources are \nsystematically directed to its highest priorities across a large and diverse agency, \nas well as ensuring consistency in the administration of the removal system. The \nproposed policy's identification of categories of aliens who constitute removal \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 12 of 34\nDHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlawfully Present \npriorities is also consistent with the categorical nature of Congress's instruction to \nprioritize the removal of criminal aliens in the OHS Appropriations Act. \nAnd, significantly, the proposed policy does not identify any category of re \nmovable aliens whose removal may not be  pursued  under any circumstances. \nAlthough the proposed  policy  limits the discretion of immigration  officials to \nexpend resources to remove non-priority aliens, it does not eliminate that discre \ntion entirely. It directs immigration officials to use their resources to remove aliens \nin  a manner \"commensurate with the level of prioritization identified,\" but (as \nnoted above) it does not \"prohibit or discourage the apprehension, detention, or \nremoval of aliens  unlawfully  in  the United  States  who are  not  identified  as \npriorities.\" Johnson  Prioritization Memorandum at 5. Instead, it authorizes the \nremoval of even non-priority aliens if, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office \nDirector, \"removing such an alien would serve an important federal interest,\" a \nstandard the policy leaves open-ended. Id.  Accordingly, the policy provides for \ncase-by-case determinations about  whether an  individual alien's circumstances \nwa1nnt the expenditure of removal resources, employing a broad standard that \nleaves ample room  for the exercise of individualized discretion by responsible \nofficials. For these reasons, the proposed policy avoids the difficulties that might \nbe raised by a more inflexible prioritization policy and dispels any concern that \nOHS  has  either undertaken  to  rewrite  the  immigration  laws  or abdicated  its \nstatutory responsibilities with respect to non-priority aliens.' \nII. \nWe turn next to the permissibility of OHS 's proposed deferred action programs \nfor certain aliens who are parents of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents \n(\"LPRs\"),  or DACA recipients, and who are not removal priorities under the \nproposed policy discussed above. We begin by discussing the history and current \npractice of defetTed action. We then discuss the legal authorities on which defetTed \n' In Crane v. Napolitano, a district court recently concluded in a non-prcccdential opinion that the \nINA \"mandates the initiation or removal proceedings whenever an immigration officer encounters an \nillegal alien who is not 'clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.\"' Opinion and Order \nRespecting Pl. App. for Prelim. Inj. Relief, No. 3:12-cv-03247-0, 2013 WL 1744422, at *5 (N.D. Tex. \nApr. 23) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A)). The court later dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. \nSee Crane v. Napolirano, No. 3:12-cv-03247-0, 2013 WL 8211660, at  *4 (N.D. Tex. July 31). \nAlthough the opinion lacks precedential value. we have nevertheless considered whether, as it suggests, \nthe text of the INA categorically forecloses the exercise of enforcement discretion with respect to aliens \nwho have not been formally admitted. The district court's conclusion is, in our view, inconsistent with \nthe Supreme Court's reading of the INA as permitting immigration officials to exercise enforcement \ndiscretion at any stage of the removal process, including when deciding whether to initiate removal \nproceedings against a particular alien. See Ari=ona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499; A111.-ArabA111i-Discri111. Comm., \n525 U.S. at 483-84. It is also difficult to square with authority holding that the presence of mandatory \nlanguage in a statute. standing alone, does not necessarily limit the Executive Branch's enforcement \ndiscretion, see. e.g.. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 835: Inmates ofA llica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 F.2d \n375, 381 (2d Cir. 1973) \nII \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 13 of 34\nOpinions oft he Office o_( Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \naction  relies  and  identify  legal  principles  against which  the proposed  use of \ndeferred action can be evaluated. Finally, we turn to an analysis of the proposed \ndeferred action programs themselves, beginning with the program for parents of \nU.S. citizens and LPRs, and concluding with the program for parents of DACA \nrecipients. \nA. \nIn immigration law, the term \"deferred action\" refers to an exercise of adminis \ntrative discretion in which immigration officials temporarily defer the removal of \nan alien unlawfully present in the United States. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., \n525 U.S. at 484 (citing 6 Charles Gordon et al., immigration Law and Procedure \n§ 72.03(2](h] ( 1998)); see USCIS, Standard Operating Procedures for Handling \nDeferred Action Requests at USC JS Field Offices at 3 (2012) (\"USCIS SOP\"); fNS \nOperating Instructions§ 103.l(a)(I)(ii) (1977). It is one ofa number of forms of \ndiscretionary relief- in addition to such statutory and non-statutory measures as \nparole,  temporary  protected  status,  deferred  enforced  departure,  and  extended \nvoluntary  departure---that  immigration  officials  have  used  over  the  years  to · \ntemporarily prevent the removal of undocumented aliens.; \n5 Parole is available to aliens by statute \"for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public \nbenefit.\" 8 U.S.C. § I 182(d)(S)(A). Among other things, parole gives aliens the ability to adjust their \nstatus without leaving the United States if they are otherwise eligible for adjustment of status, see id. \n§ 125S(a),  and  may eventually  qualify them  for  Federal  means-tested benefits, see  id.  §§ 1613, \n1641 (b)(4 ). Temporary protected status is available to nationals of designated foreign states affected by \narmed conflicts, environmental disasters, and other extraordinary conditions. id.  § I 254a. Deferred \nenforced departure, which \"has no statutory basis\" but rather is  an  exercise of \"the President's \nconstitutional powers to conduct foreign relations,\" may be granted to nationals of appropriate foreign \nstates. USCIS, Adjudicator's Field Manual § 38.2(a) (2014). Extended voluntary departure was a \nremedy derived from the voluntary deparn1re statute, which, before its amendment in 1996, permitted \nthe Attorney General to make a finding of removabiliry if an alien agreed to voluntarily depart the \nUnited States, without imposing a time limit for the alien's departure. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b), 1254(e) \n( 1988 & Supp. II 1990): cf 8 U S.C. § I 229c (current provision of the !NA providing authority to grant \nvoluntary departure. but limiting such grants to 120 days). Some commentators, however. suggested \nthat extended voluntary departure was in fact a form of\"discretionary relief formulated administrative \nly under the Attorney General's general authority for enforcing immigration law.\" Sharon Stephan, \nCong. Research Serv., 85-599 EPW, Extended VoluntOJ)' Departure and Other Grants of Blanket Reli~f \nfrom Deportation at I (Feb. 23. 1985). It appears that extended voluntary departure is no longer used \nfollowing enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990, which established the temporary protected status \nprogram. See U.S. Citi~enship and l111111igration Services Fee Schedule, 75 Fed. Reg. 33446, 33457 \n(June 11, 20 I 0) (proposed rule) (noting that \"since 1990 neither the Altorney General nor the Secretary \nhave designated a class of aliens for nationality-based 'extended voluntary departure,' and there no  I \nlonger are aliens in the United States benefiting from such a designation,\" but noting lhat deferred  I \nenforced departure is still used); 1-1.R. Rep. No. I 02-123, at 2 ( 1991) (indicating that in establishing  L \ntemporary  protected  status,  Congress  was  \"codif[ying]  and  supersed[ing)\"  extended  voluntary \ndeparture).

For many \nyears after the INA was enacted, INS exercised prosecutorial discretion to grant \n\"non-priority\" status to removable aliens who presented \"appealing humanitarian \nfactors.\" Letter for Leon Wildes, from E. A. Loughran, Associate Commissioner, \nINS at 2 (July  16,  1973) ( defining a \"non-priority case\" as \"one in which the \nService in  the exercise of discretion detennines that adverse action would be \nunconscionable because of appealing humanitarian factors\"); see INS Operating \nInstructions § I 03. I (a)([ )(ii) (l 962). This form of administrative discretion was \nlater tern1ed \"deferred action.\" Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. at 484; \nsee INS Operating Instructions § I 03. I (a)( I )(ii) ( 1977) (instructing immigration \nofficers  to  recommend  deferred  action  whenever  \"adverse  action  wou Id  be \nunconscionable because of the existence of appealing humanitarian factors\"). \nAlthough the practice of granting deferred action \"developed without express \nstatutory  authorization,\"  it  has  become  a  regular  feature  of the  immigration \nremoval system that has been acknowledged by both Congress and the Supreme \nCourt. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. at 484 (internal quotation marks \nomitted); see id.  at 485 (noting that a congressional enactment limiting judicial \nreview of decisions \"to  commence proceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or execute \nremoval orders against any alien under [the INA]\" in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \"seems \nclearly designed  to  give some measure  of protection  to  'no deferred  action' \ndecisions  and  similar  discretionary  determinations\"); see  also,  e.g.,  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1154(a)(l)(D)(i)(Il), (IV) (providing that certain  individuals are \"eligible for \ndeferred action\"). Deferred action \"does not confer any immigration status\"-i.e., \nit does not establish any enforceable legal right to remain in the United States \nand it may be revoked by immigration authorities at their discretion. USCIS SOP \nat 3, 7. Asswning it is not revoked, however, it represents DHS's decision not to \nseek the alien's removal for a specified period of time. \nUnder longstanding regulations and policy gLridance promulgated pursuant to \nstatutory  authority  in  the  INA,  deferred  action  recipients  may  receive  two \nadditional benefits. First, relying on DHS's statutory authority to authorize certain \naliens to work in the United States, OHS regulations permit recipients of deferred \naction  to apply for work authorization  if they can  demonstrate an \"economic \nnecessity for employment.\" 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(l4); see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) \n(defining an \"unauthorized alien\" not entitled to work in the United States as an \nalien who is neither an LPR nor \"authorized to be ... employed by [the INA] or \nby the Attorney General [ now the Secretary of Homeland Security]\"). Second, \nOHS has promulgated regulations and issued policy guidance providing that aliens \nwho receive deferred action will temporarily cease accruing \"unlawful presence\" \nfor  purposes  of  8  U .S.C.  § I l 82(a)(9)(B)(i)  and  (a)(9)(C)(i)(I).  8  C.F.R. \n§ 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § I I00.35(b)(2);  Memorandum  for  Field  Leadership, \nfrom  Donald  Neufeld, Acting Associate  Director,  Domestic Operations  Direc \ntorate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation a/Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence for \nPurposes  of Sections  2 l 2(a)(9)(B)(i)  and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I)  of the  Ac/  at  42 \n13 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 15 of 34\nOpinions oft he Office ofL egal Counsel in Volume 38 \n(May 6, 2009) (\"USCIS Consolidation of Guidance\") (noting that \"[a]ccrual of \nunlawful presence stops on the date an  alien  is granted deferred action\"); see \n8 U.S.C. § I 182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (providing that an alien is \"unlawfully present\" if, \namong other things, he \"is present in the United States after the expiration of the \nperiod of stay authorized by the Attorney General\").'' \nImmigration officials today continue to grant deferred action in individual cases \nfor  humanitarian and  other purposes,  a  practice  we  will  refer to  as \"ad hoc \ndeferred action.\" Recent USCIS guidance provides that personnel may recommend \nad hoc deferred action if they \"encounter cases during [their] normal course of \nbusiness that they feel warrant deferred action.\" USCIS SOP at 4. An alien may \nalso apply for ad hoc defen·ed action by submitting a signed, written request to \nUSCIS  containing \"[a]n  explanation  as  to  why he  or she  is seeking deferred \naction\" along with supporting documentation, proof of identity, and other records. \nId at 3. \nFor decades, INS and later DHS have also implemented broader programs that \nmake discretionary relief from removal available for pa11icular classes of aliens. In \nmany  instances,  these  agencies  have  made  such  broad-based  relief available \nthrough the use of parole, temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, \nor extended voluntary depai1ure. For example, from  1956 to  I 972, INS imple \nmented an extended voluntary departure program for physically present aliens who \nwere beneficiaries of approved visa petitions-known as \"Third Preference\" visa \npetitions-relating to a specific class of visas for Eastern Hemisphere natives. See \nUnited States ex rel. Parco v. Morris, 426 F. Supp. 976, 979-80 (E.D. Pa. 1977). \nSimilarly, for several years beginning in 1978, INS granted extended voluntary \ndepa11ure to nurses who were eligible for H-1 visas. Voluntary Departure/or Out \nofStatus Nonimmigrant H-1 Nurses, 43 Fed. Reg. 2776, 2776 (Jan. 19, l 978). In \naddition, in  more than two dozen  instances dating to  1956, INS and later DHS \ngranted  parole,  temporary  protected  status,  deferred  enforced  depa1ture,  or \nextended voluntary departure to large numbers of nationals of designated foreign \nstates.  See,  e.g.,  CRS  Immigration  Report  at 20-23;  Cong.  Research  Serv., \nED206779, Review of U.S. Refugee Resettlement Programs and Policies at 9, 12-\n14  ( 1980).  And  in  I 990,  INS  implemented a \"Family  Fairness\" program  that \nauthorized granting extended voluntary depai1ure and work authorization to the \nestimated 1.5 million spouses and children of aliens who had been granted legal \nstatus under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-\n603, 100 Stat. 3359 (\"IRCA\"). See Memorandum for Regional Commissioners, \n<, Section I I 82(a)(9)(8)(i) imposes three- and ten-year bars on the admission of aliens (other than \naliens admitted to permanent residence) who departed or were removed from the United States after \nperiods of unlawful  presence of between  180 days and  one year, or one year or more.  Section \nI 182(a}(9)(C)(i)(I) imposes an  indefinite bar on the admission of any  alien who, without  being \nadmitted, enters or attempts to reenter the United States after previously having been unlawfully \npresent in the United States for an aggregate period of more than one year. \n14 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 16 of 34\nDHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal a/Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present \nINS, from Gene McNary, Commissioner, INS, Re: Family Fairness: Guidelines \nfor  Voluntary  Departure  under 8 CFR  242.5 for  the  Ineligible  Spouses  and \nChildren of Legalized Aliens (Feb. 2,  1990) (\"Family Fairness Memorandum\"); \nsee also CRS Immigration Report at I 0. \nOn at least five occasions since the late 1990s, INS and later OHS have also \nmade discretionary relief available to certain classes of aliens through the use of \ndeferred action: \nI. Deferred Action for Battered Aliens Under the Violence Against Women Act. \nINS established a class-based deferred action program in  I 997 for the benefit of \nself-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (\"VA WA\"), Pub. \nL. No.  103-322, tit.  IV,  108 Stat.  1796,  1902. VAWA authorized certain aliens \nwho have been abused by U.S. citizen or LPR spouses or parents to self-petition \nfor  lawful  immigration status, without having to  rely  on their abusive  family \nmembers  to  petition  on  their behalf. Id  § 4070 I (a)  ( codified as  amended at \n8 U.S.C. § l 154(a)( I )(A)(iii)-(iv), (vii)). The INS program required immigration \nofficers who approved a VA WA self-petition to assess, \"on a case-by-case basis, \nwhether to place the alien in deferred action status\" while the alien waited for a \nvisa to become available. Memorandum for Regional Directors et al., INS, from \nPaul  W.  Virtue,  Acting Executive Associate Commissioner,  INS, Re: Supple \nmental Guidance on Battered Alien Self-Petitioning Process and Related Issues \nat 3 (May 6,  1997).  INS noted that \"[b ]y their nature, VA WA cases generally \npossess factors that warrant consideration for deferred action.\" Id.  But because \n\"[i]n an unusual case, there may be factors present that would militate against \ndefe1Ted action,\" the agency instructed officers that requests for deferred action \nshould still \"receive individual scrutiny.\" Id In 2000, INS repo1ied to Congress \nthat,  because of this  program,  no  approved  VA WA  self-petitioner  had  been \nremoved  from  the  country.

For example, as Congress was considering VA WA \nreautliorization legislation in 2000, INS officials testified before Congress about \ntheir  deferred  action  program  for  VA WA  self-petitioners,  explaining  that \n\"[a ]pproved [VA WA] self-petitioners are placed in deferred action status,\" such \nthat \"[n]o battered alien who has filed a[n approved] self petition ... has been \ndeported.\" H.R. 3083 Hearings at 43. Congress responded by not only acknowl \nedging  but  also  expanding the  deferred  action  program  in  the  2000  YA WA \nreauthorization  legislation,  providing  that children  who could  no  longer  self \npetition under VA WA because they were over the age of 21 would nonetheless be \n\"eligible for defetTed action and work authorization.\" Victims of Trafficking and \n' Before DACA was announced, our Office was consulted about whether such a program would be \nlegally permissible. As we orally advised, our preliminary view was that such a program would be \npermissible, provided that immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an \nindividualized basis. We noted that immigration officials typically consider factors such as having been \nbrought to the United Stales as a child in exercising their discretion to grant deferred action in \nindividual cases. We explained, however. that extending deferred action to individuals who satisfied \nthese and other specified criteria on a class-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by \nad hoc grants of deferred action. We advised that it was critical that, like past policies that made \ndeferred action available to certain classes of aliens, the DACA program require immigration officials \nto evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred \naction automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria. We also noted that, \nalthough the proposed program was predicated on humanitarian concerns that appeared less particular \nized and acute than those underlying certain prior class-wide deferred action programs. the concerns \nanimating DACA were nonetheless consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided \nthe exercise of immigration enforcement discretion. \n9 Congress has considered legislation that would limit the practice of granting deferred action, but it \nhas never enacted such a measure. In 2011, a bill was introduced in both the House and the Senate that \nwould  have  temporarily suspended  OHS 's authority  to  grant  deferred action  except  in  narrow \ncircumstances. See H.R. 2497, I 12th Cong. (2011): S.  1380, I 12th Cong. (2011). Neither chamber, \nhowever, voted on the bill. This year, the House passed a bill that purported to bar any funding for \nDACA or other class-wide deferred action programs, 1-1.R. 5272, I 13th Cong. (2014), but the Senate \nhas not considered the legislation. Because the Supreme Court has instructed that unenacted legislation \nis an unreliable indicator of legislative intent, see Red lion Broad. Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 n.11 \n( 1969). we do not draw any inference regarding congressional 'policy from these unenacted bills. \n18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 20 of 34\nDHS 's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlawfully Present \nViolence Protection Act of 2000, Pub.

Congress further clarified that \n\"[t]he denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under this subsec \ntion shall not preclude the alien from applying for ... deferred action.\" id. It also \ndirected OHS to compile a report detailing, among other things, how long DHS's \n\"specially trained [YA WA) Unit at the [USCIS) Vermont Service Center\" took to \nadjudicate victim-based immigration applications for \"deferred action,\" along with \n\"steps taken to improve in this area.\" Id § 238.

Rec. 24603 (2008). \nIn addition, in other enactments, Congress has specified that certain classes of \nindividuals should be made \"eligible for deferred action.\" These classes include \ncertain immediate family members of LPRs who were killed on September 11, \n200 I, USA PA TRJOT Act of 200 I, Pub.

L. No. \n108-136, § 1703(c)--(d), 117 Stat. 1392, 1694. ln the same legislation, Congress \nmade these  individuals  eligible  to  obtain  lawful status  as  \"family-sponsored \nimmigrant[s]\" or \"immediate relative[s)\"  of U.S. citizens.  Pub.  L. No.  I 07-56, \n§ 423(b),  I 15 Stat. 272, 361; Pub. L. No.  I 08-136, § 1703(c )( I )(A),  117 Stat. \n1392, 1694; see generally Scialabba v.  Cuellar de Osorio, 134 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 \n(2014) (plurality opinion) (explaining which aliens typically qualify as family \nsponsored immigrants or immediate relatives). \nFinally, Congress acknowledged the practice of granting deferred action in the \nREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. I 09-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231, 302 ( codified at \nIII Five years later, in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act \nor 2005, Pub. L.

One of the Act's sponsors explained that while this provision \nwas intended to \"give[] OHS statutory authority to grant work authorization ... without having to rely \nupon deferred action ... [t]he current practice of granting deferred action to approved VA WA self \npetitioners should continue.\" 151 Cong. Rec. 29334 (2005) (statement of Rep. Conyers). \n19 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 21 of 34\nOpinions oft he Office ~(legal Counsel in Volume 38 \n49 U.S.C. § 30301 note), which makes a state-issued driver's license or identifica \ntion card acceptable for federal purposes only if the state verifies, among other \nthings, that the card's recipient has \"(e]vidence of [!]awful  [s]tatus.\" Congress \nspecified that, for this purpose, acceptable evidence of lawful status includes proof \nof, among other things, citizenship, lawful permanent or temporary residence, or \n\"approved deferred action status.\" Id § 202(c)(2)(B)(viii). \nB. \nThe practice of granting deferred action, like the practice of setting enforce \nment priorities, is an exercise of enforcement discretion rooted in DHS's authority \nto enforce the immigration laws and the President's duty to take care that the laws \nare faithfully executed. It is one of several mechanisms by which immigration \nofficials,  against  a  backdrop  of limited  enforcement  resources,  exercise their \n\"broad discretion\" to administer the removal system- and, more specifically, their \ndiscretion to determine whether \"it makes sense to pursue removal\" in particular \ncircumstances. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. \nDeferred action, however, differs in at least three respects from more familiar \nand wides.pread exercises of enforcement discretion. First, unlike (for example) the \nparadigmatic exercise of prosecutorial discretion in a criminal case, the conferral \nof deferred action does not represent a decision not to prosecute an individual for \npast  unlawful  conduct;  it  instead  represents a  decision  to  openly  tolerate an \nundocumented alien's continued presence in the United States for a fixed period \n(subject to revocation at the agency's discretion). Second, unlike niost exercises of \nenforcement discretion, deferred action carries with it benefits in addition to non \nenforcement itself; specifically, the ability to seek employment authorization and \nsuspension of unlawful presence for purposes of 8 U.S.C. § l l 82(a)(9)(B)(i) and \n(a)(9)(C)(i)(J). Third, class-based deferred action programs, like those for VA WA \nrecipients  and  victims of Hurricane  Katrina,  do not merely enable individual \nimmigration officials to select deserving beneficiaries from among those aliens \nwho have been identified or apprehended for possible removal-as is the case with \nad hoc deferred action-but rather set forth certain threshold eligibility criteria and \nthen invite individuals who satisfy these criteria to apply for deferred action status. \nWhile these features of deferred action are somewhat unusual among exercises \nof enforcement discretion,  the differences  between  deferred  action  and other \nexercises of enforcement discretion are less significant than they might initially \nappear. The first  feature-the toleration of an alien's continued unlawful pres \nence- is an inevitable element of almost any exercise of discretion in immigration \nenforcement.  Any decision  not to  remove an  unlawfully  present alien-even \nthrough an exercise of routine enforcement discretion-necessarily carries with it \na tacit acknowledgment that the alien will continue to be present in the United \nStates without  legal  status.  Deferred  action  arguably  goes  beyond such  tacit \nacknowledgment by expressly communicating to the alien that his or her unlawful \n20 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 22 of 34\nDHS 's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlawfully Present \npresence will be tolerated for a prescribed period of time. This difference is not, in \nour  view,  insignificant.  But neither does  it  fundamentally  transform  deferred \naction into something other than an exercise of enforcement discretion: As we \nhave previously  noted,  deferred  action  confers  no  lawful  immigration  status, \nprovides no path to lawful permanent residence or citizenship, and is revocable at \nany time in the agency's discretion. \nWith respect to the second feature, the additional benefits deferred action con \nfers-the  ability  to  apply  for  work  authorization  and  the  tolling of unlawful \npresence-do not depend on backgrow1d principles of agency discretion  under \nDHS's general immigration authorities or the Take Care Clause at all, but rather \ndepend on independent and more specific statutory authority rooted in the text of \nthe fNA. The first of those authorities, OHS 's power to prescribe which aliens are \nauthorized to work in the United States, is grounded in 8 U.S.C. § I 324a(h)(3), \nwhich defines an \"unauthorized alien\" not entitled to work in the United States as \nan alien who is neither an LPR nor \"authorized to be ... employed by [the fNA] \nor by  the  Attorney General  [now  the Secretary  of Homeland Security].\"  This \nstatutory provision has  long been understood to  recognize the authority of the \nSecretary (and the Attorney General before him) to grant work authorization to \nparticular classes of aliens. See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12; see also Perales v.  Casi!!as, \n903 F.2d 1043, 1048-50 (5th Cir.  1990) (describing the authority recognized by \nsection 1324a(h)(3) as \"permissive\" and largely \"unfettered\").11 Although the INA \n11 Section 1324a(h)(3) was enacted in 1986 as part of !RCA. Before then, the INA contained no \nprovisions comprehensively addressing the employment of aliens or expressly delegating the authority \nto regulate the employment of aliens to a responsible federal agency. INS assumed the authority to \nprescribe the classes of aliens authorized to work in the United States under its general responsibility to \nadminister  the  immigration  laws.  In  1981,  INS  promulgated  regulations codifying  its existing \nprocedures  and criteria for granting employment authorization. See Employment Authori=ation to \nAl,ens in the United States, 46 Fed. Reg. 25079, 25080-81 (May 5, 1981) (citing 8 U.S.C. § I 103(a)). \nThose  regulations  pennitted  certain  categories of aliens who lacked  lawful  immigration status, \nincluding deferred action recipients, to apply for work authorization under certain circumstances. \n8 C.F.R. § I 09.1( b)(7) ( 1982). In !RCA, Congress introduced a \"comprehensive scheme prohibiting the \nemployment of illegal aliens in the United States,\" Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 \nU.S. 137, 147 (2002), to be enforced primarily through criminal and civil penalties on employers who \nknowingly employ an \"unauthorized alien.\" As relevant here, Congress defined an \"unauthorized \nalien\" barred from employment in the United States as an alien who \"is not ... either (A) an alien \nlawfully admined for permanent residence, or (8) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by \nrhe AllorneyGenera/.\" 8 U.SC. § 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). Shortly after !RCA was enacted, INS \ndenied a petition to rescind its employment authorization regulation, rejecting an argument that \"the \nphrase 'authorized to be so employed by this Act or the Anorney General' does not recognize. the \nAttorney General's authority to grant work authorization except to those aliens who have already been \ngranted specific authorization by the Act.\" Employment Authori=ation; Classes of Aliens Eligible, 52 \nFed. Reg. 46092, 46093  (Dec. 4, 1987). Because the same statutorY phrase refers both to aliens \nauthorized lo be employed by the INA and aliens authorized to be employed by the Attorney General. \nINS concluded that the only way to give effect to both references is to conclude \"that Congress, being \nfully aware of the Anorney General's authority to promulgate regulations, and approving of the manner \nin which he has exercised that authority in this matter, defined 'unauthorized alien' in such fashion as \nto exclude aliens  who  have  been authorized  employment by the  Attorney  General  through  the \n21 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 23 of 34\nOpinions oft he Office o_(legal Counsel in Volume 38 \nrequires the Secretary to grant work authorization to particular classes of aliens, \nsee, e.g, 8 U.S.C. § l 158(c)(l)(B) (aliens granted asylum), it places few limita \ntions on the Secretary's authority to grant work authorization to other classes of \naliens. Further, and notably, additional provisions of the INA expressly contem \nplate that the Secretary may grant work authorization to aliens  lacking  lawful \nimmigration status--even those who  are in active removal proceedings or,  in \ncertain circumstances, those who have already received final orders of removal. \nSee id.  § 1226(a)(3) (permitting the Secretary to grant work authorization to an \notherwise work-eligible  alien  who  has  been arrested  and  detained  pendit1g  a \ndecision whether to remove the alien from  the United  States); id.  § 1231( a)(7) \n(pennitting  the  Secretary  under certain  narrow  circumstances to  grant  work \nauthorization to aliens who have received final orders of removal). Consistent with \nthese provisions, the Secretary has long permitted certain additional classes of \naliens  who  lack  lawful  immigration  status  to  apply  for  work  authorization, \nincluding deferred action recipients who can demonstrate an economic necessity \nfor  employment.  See  8  C.F.R.  § 274a.12(c )( 14);  see also  id  § 274a. l 2(c )(8) \n(applicants for asylum), (c)(IO) (applicants for cancellation of removal); supra \nnote 11 (discussing 1981 regulations). \nThe Secreta1y's authority to suspend the accrual of unlawful presence of de \nferred action recipients is similarly grounded in the INA. The relevant statutory \nprovision  treats  an  alien  as  \"unlawfully  present\"  for  purposes  of 8  U.S.C. \n§ l 182(a)(9)(B)(i) and (a)(9)(C)(i)(I) ifhe \"is present in the United States after the \nexpiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General.\" 8 U.S.C. \n§ I l 82(a)(9)(B)(ii). That language contemplates that the Attorney General (and \nnow the Secretary) may authorize an alien to stay in the United States without \naccruing  unlawful  presence  under  section  l l 82(a)(9)(B)(i)  or  section \nI l 82(a)(9)(C)(i). And OHS regulations and policy guidance interpret a \"period of \nstay authorized by the Attorney General\" to include periods during which an alien \nhas  been  granted  deferred  action.  See  8  C.F.R.  § 214.14(d)(3);  28  C.F.R. \n§ I 100.35(b)(2); USCJS Consolidation of Guidance at 42. \nThe final unusual feature of deferred action programs is pa11icular to class \nbased programs. The breadth of such programs, in combination with the first two \nfeatures of deferred action, tnay raise particular concerns about whether immigra \ntion  officials  have undertaken  to  substantively  change  the statutory  removal \nsystem rather than simply adapting its application to individual circumstances. But \nthe salient feature of class-based programs- the establishment of an affirmative \napplication process with threshold eligibility criteria-does not in and of itself \ncross the line between executing the law and rewriting it. Although eve1y  class \nwide deferred action program that has been implemented to date has established \nregulatory process, in addition to those who are authorized employment by statute.\" Id.; see Commodity \nFutures Trading Co111111 '11 v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833. 844 ( 1986) (stating that \"considerable weight must \nbe accorded\" an agency's \"contemporaneous interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer\"). \n22 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 24 of 34\nDI-IS 's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlm~(ully Present \ncertain threshold eligibility criteria, each program has also left room for case-by \ncase determinations, giving immigration officials discretion to deny applications \neven if the applicant fulfills all of the program criteria. See supra pp. 15-18. Like \nthe establishment of enforcement priorities discussed in Part I, the establishment \nof threshold eligibility criteria can serve to avoid arbitrary enforcement decisions \nby individual officers, thereby furthering the goal of ensuring consistency across a \nlarge agency. The guarantee of individualized, case-by-case review helps avoid \npotential concerns that, in establishing such eligibility criteria, the Executive is \nattempting  to  rewrite  the  law by defining  new categories  of aliens  who  are \nautomatically entitled to particular immigration relief.  See Crowley Caribbean \nTransp, 37 F.3d at 676-77; see also Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4. Furthennore, \nwhile  permitting  potentially  eligible  individuals  to  apply  for  an  exercise  of \nenforcement discretion is not especially common, many law enforcement agencies \nhave developed programs that invite violators of the law to identify themselves to \nthe authorities in exchange for leniency.12  Much as is the case with those pro \ngrams,  inviting  eligible  aliens  to  identify  themselves  through  an  application \nprocess may serve the agency's law enforcement interests by encouraging lower \npriority individuals to identify themselves to the agency. In so doing, the process \nmay enable the agency to better focus its scarce resources on higher enforcement \npriorities. \nApart from  the considerations just discussed, perhaps the clearest indication \nthat these features of deferred action programs are not per se impennissible is the \nfact  that Congress, aware  of these features,  has repeatedly  enacted legislation \nappearing to endorse such programs. As discussed above, Congress has not only \ndirected that certain classes of aliens be made eligible for deferred action pro \ngrams- and in at least one instance, in the case of VA WA beneficiaries, directed \nthe expansion  of an existing  program-but also ranked evidence of approved \ndeferred action status as evidence of \"lawful status\" for purposes of the REAL ID \nAct. These enactments strongly suggest that when OHS in the past has decided to \ngrant deferred action to an individual or class of individuals, it has been acting in a \nmanner consistent with congressional policy \"'rather than embarking on a frolic of \nits own.\"' United States v.

Because deferred action, like \nthe prioritization policy discussed above, is an exercise of enforcement discretion \nrooted in the Secretary's broad authority to enforce the immigration laws and the \nPresident's duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, it is subject to \nthe same four general principles previously discussed. See supra pp. 6-7. Thus, \nany  expansion of deferred  action to  new classes  of aliens  must be  carefully \nscrutinized to ensure that it reflects considerations within the agency's expe11ise, \nand that it does not seek to effectively rewrite the laws to match the Executive's \npolicy preferences, but rather operates in a manner consonant with congressional \npolicy expressed in the statute. See supra pp. 6-7 (citing Youngstown, 343 U.S. at \n637, and Nat 'f Ass 'n of Home Builders, 551  U.S. at 658). Immigration officials \ncannot  abdicate  their statutory  responsibilities  under  the  guise  of exercising \nenforcement discretion. See supra p. 7 (citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4). And \nany new deferred action program should leave room for individualized evaluation \nof whether a pai1icular case warrants the expenditure of resources for enforcement. \nSee supra p. 7 (citing Glickman, 96 F.3d at 1123, and Crowley Caribbean Tramp., \n37 F.3d at 676-77). \nFurthermore, because deferred action programs depart in certain respects from \nmore familiar and  widespread exercises of enforcement discretion, pai1icularly \ncareful examination is needed to ensure that any proposed expansion of defeITed \naction complies with these general principles, so that the proposed program does \nnot,  in  effect, cross  the  line  between  executing the  law  and  rewriting  it.  In \nanalyzing whether the proposed programs cross this line, we will draw substantial \nguidance from Congress's history of legislation concerning deferred action. In the \nabsence of express statutory guidance, the nature of deferred action programs \nCongress has implicitly approved by statute helps to shed light on Congress's own \nunderstandings about the permissible uses of deferred action. Those understand \nings, in turn, help to inform our consideration of whether the proposed deferred \naction programs are \"faithful[]\" to the statutory scheme Congress has enacted. \nU.S. Const. art. II,§ 3. \n24 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 26 of 34\nDJ-JS 's Authorily to Priorilize Removal ofC erlain Aliens Unlawfully Present \nc. \nWe now tum to the specifics of DHS's proposed deferred action programs. \nOHS has proposed implementing a policy under which an alien could apply for, \nand would be eligible to receive, deferred action if he or she: ( 1) is not an en \nforcement priority under OHS policy; (2) has continuously resided in the United \nStates since before January 1, 20 IO; (3) is physically present in the United States \nboth when DHS announces its program and at the time of application for defe1Ted \naction; (4) has a child who is a U.S. citizen or LPR; and (5) presents \"no other \nfactors  that,  in  the  exercise of discretion, make[] the grant of deferred action \ninappropriate.\" Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum at 4. You have also asked \nabout the permissibility of a similar program that would  be open to parents of \nchildren who have received deferred action under the DACA program. We first \naddress OHS 's proposal to implement a defe1Ted action program for the parents of \nU.S. citizens and  LPRs,  and then turn to the permissibility of the program for \nparents of DACA recipients in the next section. \nI. \nWe begin by considering whether the proposed program for the parents of U.S. \ncitizens and LPRs reflects considerations within the agency's expertise. DHS has \noffered two justifications for the proposed program for the parents of U.S. citizens \nand LPRs. First, as noted above, severe resource constraints make it inevitable that \nDHS will not remove the vast majority of aliens who are unlawfully present in the \nUnited States. Consistent with Congress's instruction, DHS prioritizes the removal \nof individuals who have significant criminal records, as well as others who present \ndangers to national security, public safety, or border security. See supra p.  IO. \nParents with longstanding ties to the country and who have no significant criminal \nrecords  or  other  risk  factors  rank  among  the  agency's  lowest  enforcement \npriorities; absent significant increases in funding, the likelihood that any individu \nal  in  that category will  be determined to warrant the expenditure  of severely \nlimited enforcement resources is very low. Second, DHS has explained that the \nprogram  would  serve  an  important  humanitarian  interest  in  keeping  parents \ntogether with children who are lawfully present in the United States, in situations \nwhere such parents have demonstrated significant ties to community and family in \nthis country. See Shahoulian E-mail. \nWith respect to OHS's first justification, the need to efficiently allocate scarce \nenforcement  resources  is  a  quintessential  basis  for  an  agency's  exercise  of \nenforcement  discretion.  See  Chaney, 470  U.S. at  831.  Because,  as  discussed \nearlier, Congress has appropriated only a small fraction of the funds needed for \nfull enforcement, OHS can remove no more than a small fraction of the individu \nals who are removable under the immigration laws. See supra p. 9. The agency \nmust therefore make choices about which violations of the immigration laws it \n25 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 27 of 34\nOpinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \nwill prioritize and pursue. And as Chaney makes clear, such choices are entrusted \nlargely to the Executive's discretion. 470 U.S. at 831. \nThe deferred action program OHS proposes would not, of course, be costless. \nProcessing applications for deferred action and its renewal requires manpower and \nresources. See Arizona,  132 S.  Ct.  at 2521  (Scalia, J., concurring  in part  and \ndissenting in part). But OHS has informed us that the costs of administering the \nproposed program would be borne almost entirely by USCIS through the collec \ntion of application  fees. See Shahoulian E-mail; see also 8  U.S.C. § 1356(m); \n8 C.F.R.  § 103.7(b)(l)(i)(C), (b)(l)(i)(HH). OHS has indicated that the costs of \nadministering the  deferred  action  program would therefore not detract in  any \nsignificant way from the resources available to ICE and CBP-the enforcement \narms of OHS- which rely  on money  appropriated  by Congress to  fund their \noperations.  See  Shahoulian  E-mail.  OHS  has  explained  that,  if  anything,  the \nproposed deferred action program might increase ICE's and CBP's efficiency by \nin  effect  using  USCIS's  fee-funded  resources  to  enable  those  enforcement \ndivisions to more easily identify non-priority aliens and focus their resources on \npursuing aliens who are strong  candidates  for removal. See id.  The proposed \nprogram, in sho1i, might help OHS address its severe resow·ce limitations, and at \nthe very least likely would not exacerbate them. See id \nDHS does not, however, attempt to justify the proposed program solely as a \ncost-saving measure, or suggest that its  lack of resources alone is sufficient to \njustify creating a defe1Ted action program for the proposed class. Rather, as noted \nabove,  OHS has explained  that the program would also serve a  paiiicularized \nhumanitarian interest in promoting family unity by enabling those parents of U.S. \ncitizens and LPRs who are not otherwise enforcement priorities and who have \ndemonstrated community and family ties in the United States (as evidenced by the \nlength of time they have remained in the country) to remain united with their \nchildren in the United States. Like determining how best to respond to resource \nconstraints, determining how to address such \"human concerns\" in the immigra \ntion context is a consideration that is generally understood to fall within OHS's \nexpertise. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. \nThis second justification for the program also appears consonant with congres \nsional policy embodied in the INA. Numerous provisions of the statute reflect a \npaiiicular concern  with  uniting  aliens  with  close relatives  who  have attained \nlawful immigration status in the United States. See. e.g., Fiallo v.  Bell, 430 U.S. \n787, 795 n.6 ( 1977); INS v. Errico, 385 U.S. 214, 220 n.9 (1966) ('\"The legislative \nhistory of the  Immigration and Nationality Act clearly  indicates that the Con \ngress .. . was concerned with the problem of keeping families of United States \ncitizens and immigrants united.\"' (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 85-1199, at 7 ( 1957)). \nThe !NA provides a path to lawful status for the parents, as well as other immedi \nate relatives, of U.S. citizens: U.S. citizens aged twenty-one or over may petition \nfor parents to obtain visas that would permit them to enter and permanently reside \n26 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 28 of 34\nDHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal o/Certain Aliens Unlawfidly Present \nin the United States, and there is no limit on the overall number of such petitions \nthat may be granted. See 8 U.S.C. § l 15l(b)(2)(A)(i); see also Cuellar de Osorio, \n134  S.  Ct.  at 2197-99  (describing  the  process  for  obtaining  a  family-based \nimmigrant visa). And although the INA contains no parallel provision permitting \nLPRs to petition on behalf of their parents, it does provide a path for LPRs to \nbecome citizens, at which  point they too can petition to obtain visas for their \nparents. See,  e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1427(a) (providing that aliens are generally eligible \nto become naturalized citizens after five years of lawful permanent residence); id. \n§ 1430(a) (alien  spouses of U.S.  citizens  become eligible after three years of \nlawful  permanent  residence);  Demore  v.  Kim,  538  U.S.  510,  544  (2003).\" \nAdditionally, the INA empowers the Attorney General to cancel the removal of, \nand adjust to lawful permanent resident status, aliens who have been physically \npresent in the United States for a continuous period of not less than ten years, \nexhibit good moral character, have not been convicted of specified offenses, and \nhave immediate relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs and who would suffer \nexceptional hardship  from the alien's removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(l). DHS's \nproposal to focus on the parents of U.S. citizens and.LPRs thus tracks a congres \nsional concern, expressed in  the  INA, with  uniting the immediate families of \nindividuals who have pennanent legal ties to the United States. \nAt the same time, because the temporary relief OHS 's proposed program would \nconfer to such parents is sharply limited in comparison to the benefits Congress \nhas made available through statute, DHS's proposed program would not operate to \ncircumvent the limits Congress has placed on the availability of those benefits. \nThe statutory provisions discussed above offer the parents of U.S. citizens and \nLPRs the prospect of permanent lawful status in the United States. The cancella \ntion of removal provision, moreover, offers the prospect of receiving such status \n1.1 The INA does permit LPRs to petition on behalf of their spouses and children even before they \nhave anained citizenship. See 8 U.S.C. § l 153(a}(2). However, the exclusion of LPRs' parents from \nthis provision does not appear to reflect a congressional judgment that, until they anain citizenship, \nLPRs lack an interest in being united with their parents comparable to their interest in being united with \ntheir other immediate relatives. The distinction between parents and other relatives originated with a \n1924 statute that exempted the wives and minor children of U.S. citizens from immigration quotas, \ngave \"prelerence status\"---eligibility for a specially designated pool of immigrant visas-to other \nrelatives of U.S. citizens, and gave no favorable treatment to the relatives ofLPRs. Immigration Act of \n1924, Pub. L. No. 68-139, §§ 4(a}, 6, 43 Stat.  153, 155-56. In 1928, Congress extended preference \nstatus to LPRs' wives and minor children. reasoning that because such relatives would be eligible for \nvisas without regard to any quota when their LPR relatives became citizens, granting preference status \nto LPRs' wives and minor children would ·'hasten[]\" the \"family reunion.\" S. Rep. No. 70-245, at 2 \n( 1928): see Act of May 29, 1928. ch. 914, 45 Stat. I 009, 1009-10. The special visa status for wives and \nchildren of LP Rs thus mirrored, and was designed to comple1i1ent, the special visa status given to wives \nand minor children of U.S. citizens. In 1965, Congress eliminated the basis on which the distinction \nhad rested by exempting all \"immediate relatives\" of U.S. citizens, including parents. from numerical \nrestrictions on immigration. Pub. L. No. 89-236, § I. 79 Stat. 911, 911. But it did not amend eligibility \nfor preference status for relatives of LPRs to reflect that change. We have not been able to discern any \nrationale for this omission in the legislative history or statutory text of the 1965 law. \n27 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 29 of 34\nOpinions oft he O.[fice ofl egal Counsel in Volume 38 \nimmediately,  without  the  delays  generally  associated  with  the  family-based \nimmigrant visa process. DHS's proposed program, in contrast, would not grant the \nparents of U.S. citizens and LPRs any lawful immigration status, provide a path to \npe1111anent residence or citizenship, or otherwise confer any legally enforceable \nentitlement to remain in the United States. See USClS SOP at 3. It is true that, as \nwe have discussed, a grant of deferred action would confer eligibility to apply for \nand obtain work authorization, pursuant to the Secretary's statutory authority to \ngrant such authorization and the longstanding regulations promulgated thereunder. \nSee supra pp.  13, 21-22. But unlike the automatic employment eligibility that \naccompanies LPR status, see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3), this authorization could be \ngranted only on a showing of economic necessity, and would last only for the \nlimited duration of the deferred action grant, see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(l4). \nThe other salient features of the proposal are similarly consonant with con \ngressional policy. The proposed program would focus on parents who are not \nenforcement priorities under the prioritization policy discussed above-a policy \nthat, as explained earlier, comports with the removal priorities set by Congress. \nSee supra p. I 0. The continuous residence requirement  is  likewise consistent \nwith  legislative judgments that extended periods of continuous  residence are \nindicative of strong family and community ties. See IRCA, Pub. L. No. 99-603, \n§ 20l(a),  100  Stat.  3359,  3394  (1986)  (codified  as  amended  at  8  U.S.C. \n§ I 255a(a)(2)) (granting lawful status to certain aliens unlawfully present in the \nUnited  States since January  1,  1982);  id.  § 302(a)  (codified  as amended at \n8 U.S.C. § 1160) (granting similar relief to certain agricultural workers); H.R. \nRep.

Rep. No. 99-132, at 16 (1985) (deporting aliens who \n\"have become well  settled  in  this country\" would be a \"wasteful use of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service's limited enforcement resources\"); see \nalso Arizona,  132 S. Ct.  at 2499 (noting that \"[t]he equities of an individual \ncase\" turn  on  factors  \"including  whether  the  alien  has . . .  long  ties  to  the \ncommunity\"). \nWe also do not believe DHS's proposed program amounts to an abdication of \nits statutory responsibilities, or a legislative rule overriding the commands of the \nstatute. As discussed earlier, DHS's severe resource constraints mean that, unless \ncircumstances change, it could not as a practical matter remove the vast majority \nof removable aliens present  in  the  United  States. The fact  that the  proposed \nprogram would defer the removal of a subset of these removable aliens-a subset \nthat ranks near the bottom of the list of the agency's removal priorities-thus does \nnot, by itself, demonstrate that the program amounts to an abdication of DHS 's \nresponsibilities.  And the case-by-case discretion given to immigration officials \nunder  DHS's  proposed  program  alleviates  potential  concerns  that  OHS  has \n28 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 30 of 34\nDJ-JS's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC  ertain Aliens Unlm,fufly Present \nabdicated its statutory enforcement responsibilities with respect to, or created a \ncategorical, rule-like entitlement to immigration relief for, the particular class of \naliens eligible for the program. An alien who meets all  the criteria for deferred \naction under the program would receive deferred action only if he or she \"pre \nsent[ ed] no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion,\" would \"make[] the \ngrant of deferred action inappropriate.\" Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum \nat 4. The proposed policy does not specify what would count as such a factor; it \nthus  leaves the relevant USCJS official with substantial discretion to determine \nwhether a grant of deferred action is warranted. In other words, even if an alien is \nnot a removal priority under the proposed policy discussed in Part I, has continu \nously  resided  in  the  United  States since before  January  I, 20 I 0, is  physically \npresent in the country, and is a parent of an LPR or a U.S. citizen, the USCJS \nofficial  evaluating  the  alien's  deferred  action  application  must  still  make  a \njudgment, in the exercise of her discretion, about whether that alien presents any \nother factor that would make a grant of deferred action inappropriate. This feature \nof the proposed program ensures that it does not create a categorical entitlement to \ndeferred  action  that  could  raise  concerns  that  OHS  is  either  impe1missibly \nattempting to rewrite or categorically declining to enforce the law with respect to a \nparticular group of undocumented aliens. \nFinally,  the  proposed  deferred  action  program  would  resemble  in  material \nrespects the kinds of deferred action programs Congress has implicitly approved in \nthe past, which provides some indication that the proposal is consonant not only \nwith  interests reflected in  immigration  law  as a general matter, but also with \ncongressional understandings about the  permissible uses of deferred action. As \nnoted above, the program uses defe1Ted action as an interim measure for a group \nof aliens to whom Congress has given a prospective entitlement to lawful immi \ngration status. While Congress has provided a path to lawful status for the parents \nof U.S.  citizens and  LPRs,  the  process of obtaining  that status \"takes time.\" \nCuellar de Osorio,  I 34 S. Ct.  at 2 I 99. The proposed program would provide a \nmechanism for families to remain together, depending on their circumstances, for \nsome or all  of the  intervening period.'\"  Immigration officials  have on several \n\"DHS's proposed program would likely not permit all  potentially eligible parents to remain \ntogether with their children for the entire duration of the time until a visa is awarded. In particular, \nundocumented parents of adult citizens who are physically present in the country would be ineligible to \nadjust their status without first leaving the country if they had never been \"inspected and admitted or \nparoled into the United States.·· 8 U.S.C.  § 125S(a) (permitting the Attorney General to adjust to \npermanent resident status certain aliens present in the  United States if they become eligible  for \nimmigrant visas). They would thus need to leave the country to obtain a visa at a U.S. consulate \nabroad. See 1d. § 120 I (a): Cuellar de Osorio, 134 S. Ct. at 2197-99. But once such parents left the \ncountry, they would in  most  instances become subject to the 3- or  JO-year bar under 8 U.S.C. \n§ I I 82(a)(9)(B)(i) and therefore unable to obtain a visa unless they remained outside the country for \nthe duration of the bar. DI-IS 's proposed program would nevertheless enable other families to stay \ntogether without regard to the 3-or I 0-year bar. And even as to those families with parents who would \nbecome subject to that bar. the proposed deferred action program would have the effect of reducing the \n29 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 31 of 34\nOpinions of1he Office o,(Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \noccasions deployed deferred action programs as interim measures for other classes \nof aliens with  prospective  entitlements to  lawful  immigration status, including \nVA WA  self-petitioners, bona  fide T and U visa applicants, certain  immediate \nfamily members of certain U.S. citizens killed in combat, and certain immediate \nfamily members of aliens killed on September 11, 200 I. As noted above, each of \nthese programs has received Congress's implicit approval-and, indeed, in  the \ncase of VA WA self-petitioners, a direction to expand the  program beyond its \noriginal bounds. See supra pp.  18-20.\" In addition, much like these and other \nprograms Congress has implicitly endorsed, the program serves substantial and \nparticularized humanitarian interests. Removing the parents of U.S. citizens and \nLPRs-that is, of children who have established permanent legal ties to the United \nStates-would separate them  from  their nuclear families, potentially  for many \nyears, until they were able to secure visas through the path Congress has provided. \nDuring that time, both the parents and their U.S. citizen or LPR children would be \ndeprived of both the economic support and the intangible benefits that families \nprovide. \nWe recognize that the proposed program would likely differ in size from these \nprior deferred  action  programs.  Although  DHS  has indicated that there is  no \nreliable way to know how'many eligible aliens would actually apply for or would \nbe likely to receive deferred action following individualized consideration under \nthe proposed program, it has informed us that approximately 4 million individuals \ncould  be eligible  to  apply.  See Shahoulian E-mail.  We have thus considered \nwhether the size of the program alone sets it at odds with congressional policy or \nthe  Executive's duties under the Take Care Clause.  In the absence of express \nstatutory guidance, it is difficult to say exactly how the program's potential size \nbears on its permissibility as an exercise of executive enforcement discretion. But \nbecause the size of DHS's proposed program corresponds to the size of a popula \ntion to which  Congress  has granted a  prospective entitlement to  lawful status \namount of time the family had to spend apart, and could enable them to adjust the timing of their \nseparation according to, for example, their children's needs for care and support. \n\" Several extended voluntary departure programs have been animated by a similar rationale, and \nthe most prominent of these programs also received Congress's implicit approval. In particular, as \nnoted above, the Family Fairness policy, implemented in 1990, authorized granting extended voluntary \ndeparture and work authorization to the estimated 1.5 million spouses and children of aliens granted \nlegal status under IR CA- aliens who would eventually \"acquire lawful permanent resident status\" and \nbe able to petition on behalf of their family members. Family Fairness Memorandum at I: see supra \npp. 14--15. Later _that year, Congress granted the beneficiaries of the Family Fairness program an  I \nindefinite stay of deportation. See Immigration Act of 1990. Pub. L. No.  101-649, § 301. 104 Stat. \nl \n4978, 5030. Although it did not make that grant of relief effective for nearly a year, Congress clarified \nthat ·'the delay in effectiveness of this section shall not be construed as reflecting a Congressional \nbelief that the existing family fairness program should be modified in any way before such date.\" Id. \n§ 301(g). INS\"s policies for qualifying Third Preference visa applicants and nurses eligible for H-1 \nnonirnrnigrant status likewise extended to aliens with prospective entitlements to lawful status. See \nsupra p. 14. \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 32 of 34\nDl-fS 's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unlm~(ully Present \nwithout numerical restriction, it seems to us difficult to sustain an argument, based \non numbers alone, that DHS's proposal to grant a limited fom1 of administrative \nrelief as a temporary interim measure exceeds its enforcement discretion under the \nINA. Furthennore, while the potential size of the program is large, it is neverthe \nless only a fraction of the approximately  11  million Lmdocumented aliens who \nremain in the United States each year because OHS Jacks the resources to remove \nthem; and, as we have indicated, the program is limited to individuals who would \nbe unlikely to be removed under OHS's proposed prioritization policy. There is \nthus little practical danger that the program, simply by  virtue of its size, will \nimpede removals that would otherwise occur in its absence. And although we are \naware of no prior exercises of deferred action of the size contemplated here, INS 's \n1990 Family Fairness policy, which Congress later implicitly approved, made a \ncomparable  fraction  of  undocumented  aliens-approximately  four  in  ten \npotentially eligible for discretionary extended voluntaiy departure relief. Compare \nCRS Immigration Report at 22 (estimating the Family Fairness policy extended to \n1.5  million  undocumented  aliens),  with  Office of Policy  and  Platming,  INS, \nEstimates  of  the  Unauthorized Immigrant  Population  Residing  in  the  United \nStates: 1990 to 2000 at 10 (2003) (estimating an undocumented alien population \nof 3 .5 mill ion in  1990); see supra notes 5 &  15 ( discussing extended voluntary \ndepatture and Congress's implicit approval of the Family Fairness policy). This \nsuggests that DHS's proposed defen-ed action program is not, simply by virtue of \nits relative size,  inconsistent with  what Congress has previously  considered a \npe1111issible exercise of enforcement discretion in the immigration context. \nIn light of these considerations, we believe the proposed expansion of deferred \naction to the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs is  lawful. It reflects considera \ntions- responding  to  resource  constraints  and  to  particularized  humanitarian \nconcerns arising in the immigration context-that fall within OHS's expertise. It is \nconsistent with congressional policy, since it focuses on a group-law-abiding \nparents of lawfully present children who have substantial ties to the community \nthat Congress itself has granted favorable treatment in the immigration process. \nThe program provides for the exercise of case-by-case discretion, thereby avoiding \ncreating a rule-like entitlement to  immigration relief or abdicating OHS 's en \nforcement  responsibilities  for  a  particular  class  of aliens.  And,  like  several \ndeferred action programs Congress has approved in the past, the proposed program \nprovides interim relief that would prevent particularized harm that could otherwise \nbefall both the beneficiaries of the program  and their families. We accordingly \nconclude that the proposed program would constitute a permissible exercise of \nOHS 's enforcement discretion under the INA. \n2. \nWe now turn to the proposed deferred action program for the parents of OACA \nrecipients. The relevant considerations are, to a certain extent, similar to those \n31 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 33 of 34\nOpinions o.f1he Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 \ndiscussed above: Like the program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LP Rs, the \nproposed  program  for  parents  of DACA  recipients  would  respond  to  severe \nresource constraints that dramatically limit DHS's ability to remove aliens who are \nunlawfully present, and would be limited to individuals who would be unlikely to \nbe removed under DHS's proposed prioritization policy. And like the proposed \nprogram for LPRs and U.S. citizens, the proposed program for DACA parents \nwould  preserve a  significant measure of case-by-case discretion  not to  award \ndeferred action even if the general eligibility criteria are satisfied. \nBut the proposed program for parents of DACA recipients is unlike the pro \nposed program for parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs in two critical respects. First, \nalthough OHS justifies the proposed program in large part based on considerations \nof family unity, the parents of DACA recipients are differently situated from the \nparents of U.S. citizens and LPRs under the  family-related  provisions of the \nimmigration law. Many provisions of the INA reflect Congress's general concern \nwith not separating individuals who are legally entitled to live in the United States \nfrom  their  immediate family  members. See,  e.g.,  8  U.S.C.  § 1151( b) (2)(A)(i) \n(permitting  citizens  to  petition  for  parents,  spouses  and  children);  id. \n§ I 229b(b) ( l)  (allowing  cancellation  of removal  for  relatives  of citizens  and \nLPRs). But the immigration laws do not express comparable concern for uniting \npersons who lack lawful status ( or prospective lawfu I status) in the United States \nwith their families. OACA recipients unquestionably lack lawful  status in  the \nUnited States. See DACA Toolkit at 8 (\"Deferred action ... does not provide you \nwith a lawful status.\"). Although they may presumptively remain in  the United \nStates, at least for the duration of the grant of deferred action, that grant is both \ntime-limited and contingent, revocable at any time in  the agency's discretion. \nExtending deferred action to the parents of DACA recipients would therefore \nexpand family-based immigration relief in a  manner that deviates in important \nrespects from the immigration system Congress has enacted and the policies that \nsystem embodies. \nSecond, as it has been described to us, the proposed defened action program \nfor the parents of DACA recipients would represent a significant departure from \ndeferred  action  programs that  Congress  has  implicitly  approved  in  the  past. \nGranting deferred action to the parents of DACA recipients would not operate as \nan  interim measure for  individuals to whom Congress has given a prospective \nentitlement to lawful status. Such parents have no special prospect of obtafoing \nvisas, since Congress has not enabled them to self-petition- as it has for VA WA \nself-petitioners  and  individuals  eligible  for  T  or  U  visas-or enabled  their \nundocumented children to petition for visas on their behalf. Nor would granting \ndeferred action to parents of DACA recipients, at least in the absence of other \nfactors, serve interests that are comparable to those that have prompted implemen \ntation  of defe1Ted  action  programs  in  the  past.  Family  unity  is,  as  we have \ndiscussed, a significant humanitarian concern that underlies many provisions of \nthe INA. But a concern with furthering family unity alone would not justify the \n32 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-10   Filed 09/11/17   Page 34 of 34\nDHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal ofC ertain Aliens Unfm~{ully Present \nproposed program, because in  the absence of any family  member with  lawful \nstatus  in  the United  States,  it would not explain  why that concern should be \nsatisfied  by  permitting  family  members  to remain  in  the  United  States.  The \ndecision to grant deferred action to DACA parents thus seems to depend critically \non the earlier decision to make deferred action available to their children. But we \nare aware of no precedent for using deferred action in this way, to respond to \nhumanitarian  needs  rooted  in  earlier exercises  of deferred  action.  The  logic \nunderlying such an expansion does not have a clear stopping point:  It would \nappear to argue in favor of extending relief not only to parents of DACA recipi \nents, but also to the close relatives of any alien granted deferred action through \nDACA or any other program, those relatives' close relatives, and perhaps the \nrelatives (and relatives' relatives) of any alien granted any fom1 of discretionar9 \nrelief from removal by the Executive. \nFor these reasons, the proposed deferred action program  for the parents of \nDACA recipients is meaningfully different from  the proposed program for the \nparents of U.S. citizens and LPRs. It does not sound in Congress's concern for \nmaintaining the integrity of families of individuals legally entitled to live in the \nUnited States. And unlike prior deferred action programs in which Congress has \nacquiesced, it would treat the Executive's prior decision to extend deferred action \nto one population  as justifying the extension of deferred  action  to  additional \npopulations. OHS, of course, remains free to consider whether to grant deferred \naction to individual parents of DACA recipients on an ad hoc basis. But in the \nabsence  of clearer  indications  that  the  proposed  class-based  deferred  action \nprogram for DACA parents would be consistent with the congressional policies \nand priorities embodied in the immigration laws, we conclude that it would not be \npermissible. \nIll. \nIn sum, for  the reasons set forth above, we conclude that OHS 's proposed \nprioritization policy and its proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents would be legally permissible, but that the \nproposed defeITed action program for parents of DACA recipients would not be \npermissible. \nKARL R.

TRUMP \nFrom the Press Office \nSpeeches & Remarks \nPress Briefings \nI \nStatements & Releases \nNominations & Appointments \nPresidential Actions \nLegislation \nDisclosures \nThe White House \nOffice of the Press Secretary \nFor Immediate Release  September 05, 2017 \nStatement from President \nJ. \nDonald  Trump \nAs President, my highest duty is to defend the American people and the \nConstitution of the United States of America. At the same time, I do not favor \npunishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. \nBut we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a \nnation of laws. \nThe legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws - this is the \nbedrock of our Constitutional system, which I took a solemn oath to preserve, \nprotect, and defend. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-12   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 5\nIn June of 2012, President Obama bypassed Congress to give work permits, social \nsecurity numbers, and federal benefits to approximately 800,000 illegal immigrants \ncurrently between the ages of 15 and 36. The typical recipients of this executive \namnesty, known as DACA, are in their twenties.  Legislation offering these same \nbenefits had been introduced in Congress on numerous occasions and rejected \neach time. \nIn referencing the idea of creating new immigration rules unilaterally, President \nObama admitted that \"I can't just do these things by myself\" - and yet that is \nexactly what he did, making an end-run around Congress and violating the core \ntenets that sustain our Republic. \nOfficials from 10 States are suing over the program, requiring my Administration to \nmake a decision regarding its legality. The Attorney General of the United States, \nthe Attorneys General of many states, and virtually all other top legal experts have \nadvised that the program is unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be \nsuccessfully defended in court. \nThere can be no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is \nable to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will. \nThe temporary implementation of DACA by the Obama Administration, after \nCongress repeatedly rejected this amnesty-first approach, also helped spur a \nhumanitarian crisis - the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central \nAmerica including, in some cases, young people who would become members of \nviolent gangs throughout our country, such as MS-13. \nOnly by the reliable enforcement of immigration law can we produce safe \ncommunities, a robust middle class, and economic fairness for all Americans. \nTherefore, in the best interests of our country, and in keeping with the obligations \nof my office, the Department of Homeland Security will begin an orderly transition \nand wind-down of DACA, one that provides minimum disruption. While new \napplications for work permits will not be accepted, all existing work permits will be \nhonored until their date of expiration up to two full years from today. Furthermore, \napplications already in the pipeline will be processed, as will renewal applications \nfor those facing near-term expiration. This is a gradual process, not a sudden phase \nout.  Permits will not begin to expire for another six months, and will remain active \nfor up to 24 months. Thus, in effect, I am not going to just cut DACA off, but rather \nprovide a window of opportunity for Congress to finally act. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-12   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 5\nOur enforcement priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on criminals, \nsecurity threats, recent border-crossers, visa overstays, and repeat violators. I have \nadvised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not \nenforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or \nare members of a gang. \nThe decades-long failure of Washington, D.C. to enforce federal immigration law \nhas had both predictable and tragic consequences: lower wages and higher \nunemployment for American workers, substantial burdens on local schools and \nhospitals, the illicit entry of dangerous drugs and criminal cartels, and many \nbillions of dollars a year in costs paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Yet few in Washington \nexpressed any compassion for the millions of Americans victimized by this unfair \nsystem.  Before we ask what is fair to illegal immigrants, we must also ask what is \nfair to American families, students, taxpayers, and jobseekers. \nCongress now has the opportunity to advance responsible immigration reform that \nputs American jobs and American security first.  We are facing the symptom of a \nlarger problem, illegal immigration, along with the many other chronic immigration \nproblems Washington has left unsolved.  We must reform our green card system, \nwhich now favors low-skilled immigration and puts immense strain on U.S. \ntaxpayers. We must base future immigration on merit - we want those coming into \nthe country to be able to support themselves financially, to contribute to our \neconomy, and to love our country and the values it stands for.  Under a merit-based \nsystem, citizens will enjoy higher employment, rising wages, and a stronger middle \nclass.  Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue have introduced the RAISE Act, \nwhich would establish this merit-based system and produce lasting gains for the \nAmerican People. \nI look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to finally \naddress all of these issues in a manner that puts the hardworking citizens of our \ncountry first. \nAs I've said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion - but \nthrough the lawful Democratic process - while at the same time ensuring that any \nimmigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens \nwe were elected to serve. We must also have heart and compassion for \nunemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-12   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 5\nAbove all else, we must remember that young Americans have dreams too. Being in \ngovernment means setting priorities. Our first and highest priority in advancing \nimmigration reform must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American \nworkers and their families. \nIt is now time for Congress to act! \nHOME  BRIEFING ROOM  ISSUES  THE ADMINISTRATION  PARTICIPATE  1600 PENN \nUSA.gov  Privacy Policy  Copyright Policy \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-13   Filed 09/11/17   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBITM \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-13   Filed 09/11/17   Page 2 of 4\nJUSTICE NEWS \nAttorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA \nWashington, DC - Tuesday, September 5, 2017 \nRemarks as prepared for delivery \nGood morning. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under \nthe Obama Administration is being rescinded. \nThe DACA program was implemented in 2012 and essentially provided a legal status for recipients for a \nrenewable two-year term, work authorization and other benefits, including participation in the social security \nprogram, to 800,000 mostly-adult illegal aliens. \nThis policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected \nlegislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens. \nIn other words. the executive branch, through DACA. deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative \nbranch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of \nimmigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch. \nThe effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, among other things, contributed to a surge of \nunaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also \ndenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens. \nWe inherited from our Founders-and have advanced-an unsurpassed legal heritage, which is the \nfoundation of our freedom, safety, and prosperity. \nAs the Attorney General, it is my duty to ensure that the laws of the United States are enforced and that the \nConstitutional order is upheld. \nNo greater good can be done for the overall health and well-being of our Republic, than preserving and \nstrengthening the impartial rule of law. Societies where the rule of law is treasured are societies that tend to \nflourish and succeed. \nSocieties where the rule of law is subject to political whims and personal biases tend to become societies \nafflicted by corruption, poverty, and human suffering. \nTo have a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest, we cannot admit everyone who \nwould like to come here. That is an open border policy and the American people have rightly rejected it. \nTherefore, the nation must set and enforce a limit on how many immigrants we admit each year and that \nmeans all can not be accepted. \nThis does not mean they are bad people or that our nation disrespects or demeans them in any way. It \nmeans we are properly enforcing our laws as Congress has passed them. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-13   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 4\nIt is with these principles and duties in mind, and in light of imminent litigation, that we reviewed the Obama \nAdministration's DACA policy. \nOur collective wisdom is that the policy is vulnerable to the same legal and constitutional challenges that the \ncourts recognized with respect to the DAPA program, which was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a \ndecision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. \nThe Fifth Circuit specifically concluded that DACA had not been implemented in a fashion that allowed \nsufficient discretion, and that DAPA was \"foreclosed by Congress's careful plan.\" \nIn other words, it was inconsistent with the Constitution's separation of powers. That decision was affirmed \nby the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote. \nIf we were to keep the Obama Administration's executive amnesty policy, the likeliest outcome is that it \nwould be enjoined just as was DAPA. The Department of Justice has advised the President and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that OHS should begin an orderly, lawful wind down, including the \ncancellation of the memo that authorized this program. \nActing Secretary Duke has chosen, appropriately, to initiate a wind down process. This will enable OHS to \nconduct an orderly change and fulfill the desire of this administration to create a time period for Congress to \nact-should it so choose. We firmly believe this is the responsible path. \nSimply put, if we are to further our goal of strengthening the constitutional order and the rule of law in \nAmerica, the Department of Justice cannot defend this type of overreach. \nGeorge Washington University Law School Professor Jonathan Turley in testimony before the House \nJudiciary Committee was clear about the enormous constitutional infirmities raised by these policies. \nHe said: \"In ordering this blanket exception, President Obama was nullifying part of a law that he simply \ndisagreed with ..... If a president can claim sweeping discretion to suspend key federal laws, the entire \nlegislative process becomes little more than a pretense ... The circumvention of the legislative process not \nonly undermines the authority of this branch but destabilizes the tripartite system as a whole.\" \nEnding the previous Administration's disrespect for the legislative process is an important first step. All \nimmigration policies should serve the interests of the people of the United States-lawful immigrant and \nnative born alike. \nCongress should carefully and thoughtfully pursue the types of reforms that are right for the American \npeople. Our nation is comprised of good and decent people who want their government's leaders to fulfill \ntheir promises and advance an immigration policy that serves the national interest. \nWe are a people of compassion and we are a people of law. But there is nothing compassionate about the \nfailure to enforce immigration laws. \nEnforcing the law saves lives, protects communities and taxpayers, and prevents human suffering. Failure \nto enforce the laws in the past has put our nation at risk of crime, violence and even terrorism. \nThe compassionate thing is to end the lawlessness, enforce our laws, and, if Congress chooses to make \nchanges to those laws, to do so through the process set forth by our Founders in a way that advances the \ninterest of the nation. \nThat is what the President has promised to do and has delivered to the American people. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-13   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 4\nUnder President Trump's leadership, this administration has made great progress in the last few months \ntoward establishing a lawful and constitutional immigration system. This makes us safer and more secure. \nIt will further economically the lives of millions who are struggling. And it will enable our country to more \neffectively teach new immigrants about our system of government and assimilate them to the cultural \nunderstandings that support it. \nThe substantial progress in reducing illegal immigration at our border seen in recent months is almost \nentirely the product of the leadership of President Trump and his inspired federal immigration officers. But \nthe problem is not solved. And without more action, we could see illegality rise again rather than be \neliminated. \nAs a candidate, and now in office, President Trump has offered specific ideas and legislative solutions that \nwill protect American workers, increase wages and salaries, defend our national security, ensure the public \nsafety, and increase the general well-being of the American people. \nHe has worked closely with many members of Congress, including in the introduction of the RAISE Act, \nwhich would produce enormous benefits for our country. This is how our democratic process works. \nThere are many powerful interest groups in this country and every one of them has a constitutional right to \nadvocate their views and represent whomever they choose. \nBut the Department of Justice does not represent any narrow interest or any subset of the American people. \nWe represent all of the American people and protect the integrity of our Constitution. That is our charge. \nWe at Department of Justice are proud and honored to work to advance this vision for America and to do \nour best each day to ensure the safety and security of the American people. \nThank you. \nSpeaker: \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions \nAttachment(s): \nDownload ag  letter re  daca.pdf \nTopic(s): \nImmigration \nComponent(s): \nOffice of the Attorney General \nUpdated September 5, 2017 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-14   Filed 09/11/17   Page 1 of 8\nEXHIBITN \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-14   Filed 09/11/17   Page 2 of 8\nConsideration of Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals  USCIS \nForm 1-8210 \nDepartment of Homeland Security \nOMB No. 1615-0124 \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  Expires OI / 31/2019 \nA-I  Receipt  Action Block \nI \nFor \nUSCIS \nCase JD: \nUse \nOnly  D  Requcstor interviewed \nOil \nReturned:  I  I  -0  Received:  I  I  Remarks \n~ \nResubmitted:  I  I  ~ Sent:  I  I \nTo Be Completed by an Attorney or  D  Select this box if Form G-28 is attached to  I Attorney State Bar Number(!/ any): \nAccredited Representative, if any.  represent the requestor. \n.,._  START HERE -Type or print in black ink.

Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws \nis  critically  important  to  the  national  security  and  public  safety  of the \nUnited States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those \n·who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant \nthreat  to  national  security  and  public  safety.  This  is  particularly  so  for \naliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States. \nSanctuary  jurisdictions  across  the  United  States  willfully  violate  Federal \nlaw  in  an attempt  to  shield  aliens  from  removal  from  the  United States. \nThese jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people \nand to the very fabric of our Republic.  · \nTens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities \nacross  the  country,  solely  because  their  home  countries  refuse to  accept \ntheir repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time \nin  our  Federal,  State,  and  local  jails. The  presence  of such  individuals \nin  the  United  States,  and the practices of foreign  nations  that refuse  the \nrepatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest. \nAlthough Federal immigration law provides a framework for  Federal-State \npartnerships in  enforcing our immigration laws  to  ensme the removal of \naliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government \nhas failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faith \nfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes \nor categories of removable aliens from potential  enforcement. The purpose \nof this  order  is  to  direct  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies) \nto  employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United \nStates. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to: \n(a)  Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws  of the United \nStates, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article \nII,  Section  3 of the  United  States  Constitution and section  3331  of title \n5, United States Code; \n(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient \nand faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States; \n(c)  Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply  with  applicable Federal \nlaw do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law; \n(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly \nremoved; and \n(e)  Support  victims,  and  the  families  of victims,  of crimes  committed \nby removable aliens. \nSec.  3.  Definitions.  The  terms  of this  order, where  applicable, shall  have \nthe meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-15   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 6\n8800  Federal Register I Vol.  82, No.  18 I Monday, January 30, 2017 /Presidential Documents \nSec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United \nStates.  In  furtherance of the  policy  described  in  section  2  of this  order, \nI hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful \nexecution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable \naliens. \nSec. 5.  Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws \nof the United States,  the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall \nprioritize  for  removal  those  aliens  described by  the  Congress  in sections \n212(a)(2).  (a)(3).  and  (a)(6)(C),  235,  and  237(a)(2)  and  (4)  of  the  INA  (8 \nU.S.C.  1182(a)(2),  (a)(3).  and  (a)(6)(C).  1225,  and  1227(a)(2)  and  (4)),  as \nwell as removable aliens who: \n(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense; \nCb)  Have  been  charged  with  any  criminal  offense,  where  such  chaTge \nhas not been resolved; \n(c)  Have  committed  acts  that  constitute  a  chaTgeable  criminal  offense; \n(d)  Have  engaged  in  fraud  or  willful  misrepresentation  in  connection \nwith any official matter or application before a governmental agency; \n(e) Have abused any progrnm related to receipt of public benefits; \n(f)  Are subject to  a final  order of removal, but who have not complied \nwith their legal obligation to depart the United States; or \n(g)  In  the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose  a risk  to \npublic safety or national security. \nSec.  6.  Civil Fines  and Penalties.  As  soon as  practicable, and by no later \nthan one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance \nand promulgate regulations, where .required by law, to ensure the assessment \nand  collection of all  fines  and penalties  that  the  Secretary is  authorized \nunder  the law to  assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in  the \nUnited States and from  those who facilitate  their  presence in the United \nStates. \nSec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through \nthe Director of  U.S.  Immigration and  Customs  Enforcement, shall, to  the \nextent permitted by law and subject to the  availability  of appropriations, \ntake all  appropriate  action  to  hire  10 ,000  additional  immigration  officers, \nwho  shall  complete  relevant  training  and  be  authorized  to  perform  the \nlaw enforcement  functions  described  in section 287  of the INA  (8 U.S.C. \n1357). \nSec.  8.  Federal-State Agreements. It is  the policy of the executive branch \nto  empower State  and local  law enforcement  agencies  across  the country \nto  perform  the  functions  of  an  immigration  officer  in  the interior of the \nUnited States to the maximum extent permitted by law. \n(a)  In  furtherance  of  this  policy,  the Secretary  shall  immediately  take \nappropriate action  to  engage  with the  Governors  of the States,  as well as \nlocal officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under \nsection 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)). \n(b)  To  the extent  permitted  by  law  and  with  the  consent  of State  or \nlocal  officials, as  appropriate,  the  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate action, \nthrough agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to author \nize  State and local  law enforcement  officials,  as the Secretary determines \nare qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers \nin  relation  to  the  investigation,  apprehension,  or  detention  of  aliens  in \nthe United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. \nSuch authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal \nperformance of these duties. \n(c)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Secretary  may  structure  each \nagreement under section 287(g) of the  INA  in a  manner that provides the \nmost effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jmisdic \ntion. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-15   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 6\nFederal  Register I Vol.  82,  No.  18 I Monday, January 30,  2017 I Presidential Documents  · 8801 \nSec.  9.  Sanctumy  Jurisdictions.  It is  the policy  of  the  executive  branch \nto ensure, to the fulles.t extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivi \nsion of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373. \n(a)  In furtherance of this  policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, \nin their discretion and  to  the extent consistent with law, shall  ensure that \njurisdictions  that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C.  1373  (sanctuary \njurisdictions) are not  eligible  to receive Federal grants,  except as  deemed \nnecessary  for  law  enforcement  purposes  by  the  Attorney  General  or  the \nSecretary. The  Secretary  has  the  authority  to  designate,  in  his  discretion \nand to the extent consistent ·with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jmisdic \ntion.

She or he had a parent_o r parents who were citizens at the time of your \nbirth (if you were born abroad) and meet other requirements. \nA person may become a U.S. citizen after birth, if: \ni.  She or he applies for \"derived\" or \"acquired\" citizenship \nthrou2:h parents, or \nii.  He or she applies for naturalization. \nWho is a lawful permanent resident? \nA person is a lawful permanent resident if he or she enjoys the status accorded to \nan individual who has been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing \npermanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with immigration \nlaws, and that status has not changed. \nWho is an immigrant? \nA person who is an alien in the United States, except one legally admitted under \nspecific non-immigrant categories as discussed below in response to question 14. \nAdditionally, a person who has entered without inspection, an illegal alien, is also \nconsidered an immigrant. \nWho is a non-immigrant? \nA person who is an alien seeking temporary entry to the United States for a \nspecific purpose. The alien must have a permanent residence abroad (for most \nclasses of admission) and qualify for the nonimmigrant classification sought. The \nnonimmigrant classifications include: foreign government officials, visitors for \nbusiness and for pleasure, aliens in transit through the United States, treaty traders \nand investors, students, international representatives, temporary workers and \ntrainees, representatives of foreign information media, exchange visitors, \nfiance(e)s of U.S. citizens, intracompany transferees, NATO officials, religious \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-16   Filed 09/11/17   Page 3 of 6\nApril 27, 2017 \nworkers, and some others. Most nonimmigrants can be accompanied or joined by \nspouses and unmarried minor ( or dependent) children. \n1.  Why is the Policy changing? \na.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is changing its policy regarding \nthe extension of Privacy Act protections to all persons as directed by section \n14 of Executive Order 13768, which states, that \"[a]gencies shall, to the extent \nconsistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude \npersons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from \nthe protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable \ninformation.\" Previously, DHS had provided the administrative protections of \nthe Privacy Act to all persons, as permitted by regulatory guidance from the \nOffice of Management and Budget. The policy of the current Administration \nis to grant Privacy Act protections only to those explicitly covered by the \nPrivacy Act. \n2.  What changes result from the new Policy? \na.  Generally, the new policy clarifies that immigrants and non-immigrants may \nonly obtain access to their records through the Freedom of Information Act \nand may not be granted amendment of their records upon request. The \nExecutive Order limits the rights and protections of the Privacy Act, subject to \napplicable law, to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The new \npolicy requires that decisions regarding the collection, maintenance, use, \ndisclosure, retention, and disposal of information being held by DHS conform \nto an analysis consistent with the Fair Information Practice Principles, see \nquestions 7 and 8. \n3.  What changes to the analysis of records and information disclosure under the \nFreedom of Information Act result from the new Policy? \na.  The new Policy does not change the analysis of records and information \ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), an applicable law. \nDecisions to withhold information requested by third parties about immigrants \nand non-immigrants will be analyzed in accordance the FOIA exemptions at 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6) or (b)(7)(C), which balance the public's right to know \nabout government operations against the personal privacy interests of the \nsubject. With respect to FOIA requests about oneself, an immigrant or non \nimmigrant will receive those records that are not exempt under the FOIA, just \nlike any other person. \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-16   Filed 09/11/17   Page 4 of 6\nApril 27, 2017 \n4.  What is the impact of the new Policy on the Judicial Redress Act? \na.  The new Policy has no effect upon the Judicial Redress Act, an applicable \nlaw. The Judicial Redress Act provides that \"covered persons,\" who are \ncitizens of covered foreign states, will have both administrative and judicial \nPrivacy Act rights with respect to their information contained in \"covered \nrecords,\" which are law enforcement in nature. This means that certain foreign \nnationals, currently citizens of the majority of European Union states, may \nseek access or amendment of their covered records held and covered by a \nDHS System of Records Notice (SORN), or pursue judicial redress for access, \namendment, or wrongful disclosure of such records. For more information \nsee, https:/ hvv,,.,v. justice. gov/opcl/j udicial-redress-act-2015. \n5.  What changes to the sharing or disclosure of information with the Congress \nresult from the new Policy? \na.  The new Policy does not change the requirements for sharing information in \nfull in response to a request from the Chairperson of Congressional \nCommittee asking upon behalf of the Committee regarding a matter within the \njurisdiction of the Committee. Such a response is normally confidential for \nuse in support of the Committee's business and not a public disclosure. \nSimilarly, the new Policy does not change how we respond to Congressional \nrequests on behalf of constituents, who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents, in that it is treated as a first-party Privacy Act request by consent of \nthe constituent; nor does it change how we respond to Congressional requests \non behalf of immigrants, non-immigrants, or other third parties (such as, state \nand local government, or the Congressperson asking in a personal capacity), \nin that it is treated as a Freedom of Information Act request. \n6.  What changes to the sharing or disclosure of information with federal, state, and \nlocal law enforcement result from the new Policy? \na.  The new Policy, subject to the Judicial Redress Act or confidentiality \nprovisions provided by statute or regulation, pennits the sharing of \ninformation about immigrants and non-immigrants with federal, state, and \nlocal law enforcement. The Policy requires that such sharing conform to an \nanalysis based upon the Fair Information Practice Principles that demonstrates \na consistent relationship between the purpose for collection of the information \nand intended use. \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-16   Filed 09/11/17   Page 5 of 6\nApril 27, 2017 \n7.  What are the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)? \na.  The Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) are principles that were first \npromulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1973 \nand have guided federal government information practices going forward. The \nconcepts are integral to many privacy laws, including both the Privacy Act of \n1974 and to the E-Government Act of 2002, which also governs agency use of \nnew teclmology. The eight foundational principles are: Transparency, \nIndividual Participation, Purpose Specification, Data Minimization, Use \nLimitation, Data Quality and Integrity, Security, and Accountability and \nAuditing. For a discussion see question 8. \n8.  How do the FIPPs inform the use and protection of information by DHS? \na.  The FIPPs inform the use and protection of information by DHS as follows: \n1.  Transparency requires that DHS give public notice to its actions to \ncollect information (e.g., System of Records Notices and Privacy Impact \nAssessments, which are located on the DHS Privacy Office Website, \nand signage [see, w,vw.dhs.2.ov/privacv.]); \nii.  Individual Participation requires that, when appropriate, DHS involve \nthe person in the decision whether or not to provide personal \ninformation to DHS (i.e., make a choice); \niii.  Purpose Specification requires that DHS inform the public of its \nauthority to collect the information that it seeks-in other words, say \nwhat information is sought, why it is being sought, and whether or not \nit's submission is voluntary; \n1v.  Data Minimization requires that DHS only seek to collect the \ninformation that it needs, based upon its authority and based upon the \nmission or operation that requires the information; \nv.  Use Limitation requires that DHS use the information that it collects in \na manner compatible with the purpose and authority that permit the \ncollection; \nv1.  Data Quality and Integrity require that DHS has means to ensure the \naccuracy of the information it collects, provides measures. to maintain \nthe data free from corruption, and allow for corrections to data that \nbecome inaccurate or stale; \nvii.  Security requires that DHS ensure its data systems are protected against \nintrusion, that user access is determined by mission assignments, and \nthat remedial procedures exist to address the possibility of breach or \ndata spills; \nviii.  Accountability and Auditing require that DHS maintains the integrity \nof its systems such that it may find, use, and report upon the data \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-MEJ   Document 1-16   Filed 09/11/17   Page 6 of 6\nApril 27, 2017 \nresiding in those systems, and so that it may allow for independent \naudits to verify the accuracy of its reporting and its satisfaction of the \nprior seven principles. \n9.  What access to records is available to immigrants and non-immigrants? \na.  Immigrants and non-immigrants may access their records through the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA). Any person, inespective of immigration \nstatus, may file a FOIA request with DHS for information about him or herself \nthat DHS has in its possession and systems; he or she is entitled to a response \nthat details the search for information about the person and informs him or her \nwhether or not the records about them are released in full, released with \ncertain portions masked in accordance with exemptions under the FOIA, or \nwithheld in full. \n10. May immigrants and non-immigrants amend their records, which are held by \nOHS? \na.  Immigrants and non-immigrants may not request amendment of their records \nin accordance with the Privacy Act. DHS, however, as a matter of efficiency \nand accurate recordkeeping strives to keep all information in its possession \ncurrent. When DHS becomes aware and is able to confinn that information in \nits possession is inaccurate or no longer relevant it may choose to update or \ndispose of such information in accordance with the terms of the Federal \nRecords Act records disposition schedules that apply to the particular records \nunder review. \n11. What impact does the new Policy have on immigrants and non-immigrants \naccess to redress through the OHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Process (OHS \nTRIP)? \na.  The new Policy has no impact upon an immigrant or non-immigrant's access \nto Redress through DHS TRIP. DHS TRIP provides traveler redress to all \npersons irrespective of immigration status. Individuals, including foreign \nnationals, or persons who believe they have been improperly denied entry, \nrefused boarding for transportation, or identified for additional screening by \nDI-IS may submit a redress request through DHS TRIP. DHS TRIP is a single \npoint of contact for persons who have inquiries or seek resolution regarding \ndifficulties they experienced during their travel screening at transportation \nhubs such as airports, seaports and train stations, or at U.S. land borders.

Federal defendants oppose.  For the reasons herein, plaintiffs’ motion is\n22\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security issued a\n25\nmemorandum promulgating a deferred action policy for those without lawful immigration status\n26\nwho came to the United States as children, were continuous residents in the United States for at\n27\nleast five years, had graduated from high school, obtained a GED, or served in the military, and\n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 2 of 14\n1 met certain other criteria — a memorandum and policy known as Deferred Action for\n2 Childhood Arrivals, “DACA” for short (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 1–3).1\n3 After the change in administrations in 2017, the new Secretary of DHS, John Kelly,\n4 announced that DACA would be continued notwithstanding the rescission of other immigration\n5 policies (id. at 230).  This was done despite, and with the knowledge of, the decision of the\n6 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015),\n7 invalidating a different deferred action policy and the Supreme Court’s affirmance of that\n8 decision by an equally divided vote, United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per\n9 curiam).\n10 On September 5, 2017, however, the Acting Secretary of DHS, Elaine Duke, reversed\nt 11 the agency’s position and announced DACA’s end, effective March 5, 2018. \nr\nu\no a 12 We now have five lawsuits in this district challenging that rescission.2  Each action is\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 proceeding on a parallel track and on the same schedule, which schedule was designed to reach\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a decision on the merits and to allow appellate review by the March 5 deadline.3    \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Pursuant to the scheduling order, the federal defendants filed the administrative record\nS N 16 on October 6.  It consisted of fourteen documents spanning 256 pages, each of which was\nted  For the  17 already available to the public, and had, in fact, already been filed in this action (Dkt. No. 49\ni\nn\nU\n18 ¶ 3; Dkt. No. 64-1).\n19 In unison, plaintiffs now move to require completion of the administrative record in\n20 accordance with Section 706 of Title 5 of the United States Code.  They argue that the current\n21 record is incomplete because it contains only documents personally considered by the Acting\n22 Secretary (and then only some considered by her) and excludes any and all other documents that\n23 indirectly led to the rescission. \n24\n25 1    All docket numbers herein refer to the docket in Case No. C 17-05211 WHA.\n26\n2   There are two additional DACA lawsuits proceeding in the Eastern District of New York before\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case\n27\nNo. 16-cv-04756 NGG.\n28\n3  The fifth lawsuit,  County of Santa Clara v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05813 HRL, was related after\nplaintiffs’ motion was fully briefed and argued.\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 3 of 14\n1 The federal defendants oppose, arguing that they have already filed a complete\n2 administrative record, which they contend is properly limited to unprivileged documents\n3 actually considered by the “decision-maker,” here, the Acting Secretary (Opp. at 8–9).  \n4 This order follows full briefing and oral argument and the Court’s review of all\n5 materials in camera that appeared on the government’s privilege log.\n6 ANALYSIS\n7 1. SCOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD.\n8 Section 706 of the APA provides that judicial review of agency action shall be based\n9 on “the whole record.”  The administrative record “is not necessarily those documents that the\n10 agency has compiled and submitted as the administrative record” but rather “consists of all\nt 11 documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and\nr\nu\no a 12 includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Thompson v. United States Dep’t of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555–56 (9th Cir. 1989).  This includes not only documents that “literally\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 pass[ed] before the eyes of the final agency decision maker” but also documents that were\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 considered and relied upon by subordinates who provided recommendations to the decision-\nS N 16 maker.  People of State of Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. United States Dep’t of Agriculture, Nos.\nted  For the  17 C05-3508 & C05-4038, 2006 WL 708914, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006) (Magistrate Judge\ni\nn\nU\n18 Elizabeth Laporte) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Amfac Resorts, L.L.C. v.\n19 United States Dep’t of the Interior, 143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (Judge Royce\n20 Lamberth).\n21 The requirement that a reviewing court consider “the whole record” before rendering a\n22 decision “ensures that neither party is withholding evidence unfavorable to its position and that\n23 the agencies are not taking advantage of post hoc rationalizations for administrative decisions. \n24 Walter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n25 While it is presumed that the administrative record submitted by defendants is complete,\n26 plaintiffs can rebut this presumption with “clear evidence to the contrary.”  Cook Inletkeeper v.\n27 EPA, 400 F. App’x 239, 240 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735,\n28 740 (10th Cir. 1993)). \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 4 of 14\n1 Defendants contend a showing of bad faith or impropriety is required in order to compel\n2 a complete production of the administrative record.  This is incorrect.  True, bad faith is one\n3 basis for requiring supplementation of an administrative record, but it is not the exclusive basis. \n4 Our court of appeals has repeatedly recognized other grounds for requiring supplementation,\n5 including where it appears the “agency relied on documents not [already] included in the\n6 record.”  Pub. Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 1982); Fence Creek\n7 Cattle Co. v. United States Forest Serv., 602 F.3d 1125, 1131 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Lands\n8 Council v. Powell, 395 F.3d 1019, 1030 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n9 The “bad faith” standard of Overton Park applies where, though an administrative\n10 record exists, plaintiffs ask to go beyond the record that was before the agency and inquire into\nt 11 the thought processes of decision-makers —  in Overton Park, by taking the testimony of\nr\nu\no a 12 agency officials.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Our plaintiffs are not seeking materials beyond what were already considered, directly\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 or indirectly, by the decision-maker, and therefore need not show bad faith.  Supplementation\nS N 16 is appropriate if they show, by clear evidence, that the agency relied on materials not already\nted  For the  17 included in the record.  See Portland Audubon Soc. v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d\ni\nn\nU\n18 1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993) (distinguishing between materials “never presented to the agency”\n19 and materials that were “allegedly [] before the agency”); Fence Creek Cattle Co., 602 F.3d at\n20 1131.  \n21 Nor is defendants’ contention that it need only produce documents directly considered\n22 by the Acting Secretary correct.  Documents reviewed by subordinates, or other agencies\n23 who informed her on the issues underlying the decision to rescind DACA, either verbally or\n24 in writing, should be in the administrative record.  See Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *2. \n25 The threshold question is whether plaintiffs have shown, by clear evidence, that the record\n26\n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 5 of 14\n1 defendants produced is missing documents that were considered, directly or indirectly, by DHS\n2 in deciding to rescind DACA.4 \n3 2. PLAINTIFFS’ SHOWING OF INCOMPLETENESS.\n4 Here, the tendered administrative record consists merely of fourteen documents\n5 spanning 258 pages, which defendants contend constitute the entire record considered in\n6 making the decision to rescind DACA.  These are plainly pertinent materials, although all were\n7 publicly known and already part of the pleadings herein.   \n8 Plaintiffs seek additional materials including emails, departmental memoranda, policy\n9 directives, meeting minutes, materials considered by Secretary Duke’s subordinates,\n10 communications from White House officials or staff, communications from the Department of\nt 11 Justice, and communications between DHS and state authorities, which they contend should\nr\nu\no a 12 necessarily be part of the administrative record (Br. at 9–10).  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs drew this list, in part, from a United States Department of Justice Guidance,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 which sets forth non-binding recommendations for how to compile an administrative record and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 what to include.  United States Dep’t of Justice, Env’t and Nat. Res. Div., Guidance to Federal\nS N 16 Agencies on Compiling the Administrative Record (Jan. 1999).  Specifically, the Guidance\nted  For the  17 states that the administrative record should “[i]nclude all documents and materials prepared,\ni\nn\nU\n18 reviewed, or received by agency personnel and used by or available to the decision-maker,\n19 even though the final decision-maker did not actually review or know about the documents\n20 and materials.”  Id. at 3.  It further provides that the record should include “communications\n21 the agency received from other agencies . . . documents and materials that support or oppose\n22 the challenged agency decision . . . minutes of meetings or transcripts thereof . . . [and]\n23\n24\n25\n4   Defendants also argue that they should not be required to produce any administrative record\nwhatsoever because the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end DACA was an exercise of\n26\nprosecutorial discretion not subject to judicial review (Opp. at 1).  Earlier in these actions, our defendants\nagreed to produce the administrative record by October 6, and were then ordered to do so.  They may not now\n27\nrenege on that commitment.  At this stage, defendants are required to produce an administrative record.  Should\nthey prevail on this argument on their eventual motion to dismiss, it will be with the benefit of a proper\n28\nadministrative record.  \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 6 of 14\n1 memorializations of telephone conversations and meetings, such as memorandum or\n2 handwritten notes.”5  \n3 Plaintiffs contend that communications from DOJ and the White House are a critical\n4 part of “the whole record” due to their significant public participation in the process of\n5 rescinding DACA.  Plaintiffs first point to Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter,\n6 which DHS expressly relied upon in its memorandum terminating the program (see Dkt. No.\n7 64-1 at 251, 255).  Despite this critical and publicly disclosed role in the decision, the only DOJ\n8 document defendants include in the record is this one-page September 4 letter.  This, plaintiffs\n9 contend, is clear evidence that defendants omitted documents supporting (or contradicting) the\n10 opinions set forth in Attorney General Sessions’ letter, in particular the opinion that DACA was\nt 11 unlawfully implemented.    \nr\nu\no a 12 Additionally, the White House has repeatedly emphasized the President’s direct role\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 in decisions concerning DACA.  For example, a September 5 White House press release\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 announced “President Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration” by rescinding DACA, and repeatedly stated that “President Trump” had acted to\nS N 16 end the program.   Press Release, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, President\nted  For the  17 Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to Immigration (Sept. 5, 2017),\ni\nn\nU\n18 https://www.whitehouse.gov/thepress-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-\n19 responsibility-and-rule-law.  Other articles likewise emphasize White House officials’ roles\n20 in decision-making regarding DACA.  See, e.g., Michael D. Shear & Julie Hirschfeld Davis,\n21 Trump Moves to End DACA and Calls on Congress to Act, New York Times (Sept. 5, 2017). \n22 Moreover, defendants concede in their response that Secretary Duke “received advice from\n23 other members of the executive branch” in making her decision (Opp. at 17) and refer to “White\n24 House memorandum” in their privilege log (Dkt. No. 71-2).  And at oral argument, counsel for\n25\n5  A 2008 DOJ memorandum specifically notes that the 1999 Guidance is a non-binding internal\n26\ndocument, which does not “limit the otherwise lawful prerogatives of the Department of Justice or any other\nfederal agency” (Dkt. No. 71-1 at 3).  In particular, the 2008 memorandum takes issue with outside parties’ use\n27\nof the Guidance in litigation to advocate for a particular composition of the administrative record or process for\nits assembly (ibid.).  Recognizing that the 1999 Guidance is not binding upon agencies, this order finds that the\n28\nGuidance nevertheless provides helpful insight into the types of documents and materials an agency should\nconsider when assembling an administrative record.   \n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 7 of 14\n1 defendants said it was likely Secretary Duke had received verbal input before making her\n2 decision.  Despite this, defendants have failed to provide even a single document from any\n3 White House officials or staff. \n4 Plaintiffs further observe that not a single document from one of Secretary Dukes’\n5 subordinates is in the record.  It strains credulity to suggest that the Acting Secretary of DHS\n6 decided to rescind a program covering 800,000 enrollees without consulting one advisor or\n7 subordinate within DHS.  Again, at oral argument, government counsel represented that she\n8 had likely received verbal input.  The government’s in camera submission confirms that she\n9 did receive substantial DACA input.      \n10 Finally, former DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum in February 2017,\nt 11 in which he rescinded all DHS memoranda that conflicted with newly stated immigration\nr\nu\no a 12 enforcement policies — but expressly declined to rescind DACA  (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 229–30). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 This decision, of course, is directly contrary to that taken by Acting Secretary Duke seven\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 months later.  The administrative record, however, omits all materials explaining the change\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 in position from February to September, with two exceptions — (1) a June 29 letter from Ken\nS N 16 Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, to Attorney General Sessions, in which he threatens\nted  For the  17 to amend the suit challenging DAPA to also challenge DACA if it is not rescinded by\ni\nn\nU\n18 September 5, and (2) Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter to Secretary Duke\n19 expressing the opinion that DHS should rescind DACA.  Reasoned agency decision-making\n20 ordinarily “demand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it is changing position” and\n21 “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n22 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Accordingly, “the whole record” would ordinarily contain materials\n23 giving a “reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding the facts and circumstances that underlay or\n24 were engendered by the prior policy.”  Ibid.  It is simply not plausible that DHS reversed policy\n25 between February and September because of one threatened lawsuit (never actually filed)\n26 without having generated any materials analyzing the lawsuit or other factors militating in favor\n27 of and against the switch in policy.         \n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 8 of 14\n1 Based on the foregoing, plaintiffs have clearly shown that defendants excluded highly\n2 relevant materials from the administrative record and in doing so have rebutted the presumption\n3 that the record is complete.\n4 Defendants’ argument to the contrary is unpersuasive.  Their position that only selected\n5 documents that Acting Secretary Duke personally reviewed need be part of the administrative\n6 record must yield to legal authority requiring both directly and indirectly considered documents\n7 be included in the record, see, e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555–56, and by public statements\n8 illustrating both DOJ and the White House’s direct involvement in the decision to rescind\n9 DACA.  The rule that government counsel advocates would allow agencies to contrive a record\n10 that suppresses information actually considered by decision-makers and by those making\nt 11 recommendations to the decision-makers, information that might undercut the claimed rationale\nr\nu\no a 12 for the decision.   \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 As stated, privilege log entries reveal several documents that were considered in arriving\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 at the decision to rescind DACA.  For example, at least seven entries refer to commentary in\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 media articles regarding DACA.  At oral argument, government counsel admitted that the\nS N 16 Acting Secretary had seen several media items on the issue.  There were not, however, any\nted  For the  17 media articles on DACA in the administrative record, but those that came to the Acting\ni\nn\nU\n18 Secretary should, of course, be included.6 \n19 Here, plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of completeness.  It is evident that Acting\n20 Secretary Duke considered information directly, or indirectly, through the advice of other\n21 agencies and others within her own agency.  These documents, as set forth in detail below,\n22 should be made part of the administrative record and must be produced by defendants in an\n23 amended administrative record by NOON ON OCTOBER 27.\n24\n6  Many documents were evidently excluded in their entirety based on an assertion of “deliberative-\n25\nprocess” privilege.  Any “[f]actual portions of documents covered by the deliberative process privilege,\n[however], must be segregated and disclosed unless they are so interwoven with the deliberative material” that\n26\nthey are not segregable.  See Pac. Fisheries, Inc. v. United States, 539 F.3d 1143, 1148 (9th Cir 2008) (citations\nand quotations omitted).  Accordingly, to the extent that media articles or other non-privileged factual materials\n27\nwere considered, they should have been included in the administrative record, and shall be filed as part of the\namended administrative record, even if passages are redacted as deliberative, and called out as such in the\n28 privilege log.  \n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 9 of 14\n1 3. WAIVER OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. \n2 Plaintiffs next argue that defendants have waived attorney-client privilege because they\n3 have put their attorneys’ legal opinions at issue by arguing that the rescission was required due\n4 to concerns over DACA’s legality (Br. at 15–16).  Indeed, one of DHS’s primary rationales for\n5 rescinding DACA was its purported illegality (see Dkt. No. 64-1 at 253–56 (Rescission\n6 Memorandum)).  \n7 Parties are not permitted to advance conclusions that favor their position in litigation,\n8 and at the same time shield the information that led to those conclusions from discovery. \n9 See Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 1992).  Put differently, “[t]he\n10 privilege which protects attorney-client communications may not be used both as a sword and a\nt 11 shield.”   Ibid.  Where a party raises a claim, which in fairness to its adversary requires it to\nr\nu\no a 12 reveal the information or communication that claim is predicated upon, it has implicitly waived\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 any privilege over that communication.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Here, defendants argue that DHS had to rescind DACA because it exceeded the lawful\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authority of the agency.  They cannot, therefore, simultaneously refuse to disclose the legal\nS N 16 research that led to that conclusion.  Defendants indeed, have included the September 4 legal\nted  For the  17 opinion of the Attorney General, pithy as it may be — yet they seek to conceal all other legal\ni\nn\nU\n18 analysis available to the Acting Secretary and to the Attorney General.   \n19 Significantly, defendants slide into a backup argument that the agency’s legal worry was\n20 “reasonable” even if wrong.  If this backup argument comes into play (as government counsel\n21 posits) then the “reasonableness” of taking an incorrect legal position would heavily turn on the\n22 underlying legal analysis so far withheld from view.   In other words, assessing the\n23 reasonableness of the Secretary’s legal rationale would turn, in part, on how consistent the\n24 analysis has been in the runup to the rescission.\n25 Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  They first argue, without citation\n26 to any legal authority, that “[w]ere plaintiffs’ argument accepted, the government would be\n27 deemed to have waived all privileges any time an assessment of the legal landscape informed an\n28 agency’s decisionsmaking” (Opp. at 21).  This argument vastly exaggerates plaintiffs’ position,\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 10 of 14\n1 and misrepresents the position defendants have staked out in this litigation.  DHS specifically\n2 relied upon DOJ’s assessment that DACA “was effectuated . . . without proper statutory\n3 authority,” “was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch” and “has\n4 the same legal and constitutional defects that courts recognized as to DAPA” (Dkt. No. 64-1 at\n5 254).  Plaintiffs are entitled to challenge whether this was a reasonable legal position and thus a\n6 reasonable basis for rescission.  In making that challenge, plaintiffs are entitled to review the\n7 internal analyses that led up to this change in position.        \n8 Defendants further argue that the decisions cited by plaintiffs are inapplicable because\n9 they arose in different contexts than the present action.  True, the decisions plaintiffs cite did\n10 not arise in identical circumstances.  E.g. Chevron Corp., 974 F.2d at 1162 (defendant\nt 11 prohibited from relying on legal opinion that tax position was reasonable while refusing to\nr\nu\no a 12 disclose the attorney communications leading to that conclusion).  They still, however, stand for\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the widely-accepted proposition that it is unfair for a litigant to defend his action with a\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 selective disclosure of evidence.  This principle carries no less force here.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In the related context of FOIA, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that\nS N 16 “the attorney-client privilege may not be invoked to protect a document adopted as, or\nted  For the  17 incorporated by reference into an agency’s policy.”  Nat’l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of\ni\nn\nU\n18 Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 360 (2d Cir. 2005).  There, DOJ invoked the reasoning of an OLC\n19 memorandum to justify its new position on an immigration issue.  Id. at 357.  The court held\n20 that the agency’s “view that it may adopt a legal position while shielding from public view the\n21 analysis that yielded that position is offensive to FOIA.”  Id. at 360.  So too here.     \n22 Defendants have waived attorney-client privilege over any materials that bore on\n23 whether or not DACA was an unlawful exercise of executive power and therefore should be\n24 rescinded. \n25 4. DELIBERATIVE-PROCESS PRIVILEGE BALANCING.\n26 Defendants further assert the deliberative-process privilege over many documents.  \n27 The deliberative-process privilege, however, is qualified and will yield when the need\n28 for materials and accurate fact-finding “override the government’s interest in non-disclosure.” \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 11 of 14\n1 F.T.C. v. Warner Commc’ns Inc., 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984).  “Among factors to\n2 be considered in making this determination are:  (1) the relevance of the evidence; (2) the\n3 availability of other evidence; (3) the government’s role in the litigation; and (4) the extent to\n4 which disclosure would hinder frank and independent discussion regarding contemplated\n5 policies and decisions.”  Ibid.  \n6 As set forth below, the judge has personally reviewed in camera all materials on the\n7 privilege log and applied the foregoing test to each document for which the deliberative-process\n8 privilege is claimed.7\n9 5. PRIVILEGE LOG REQUIREMENT.\n10 While defendants did not file a privilege log with their original production, they have\nt 11 since, pursuant to order, filed a privilege log claiming attorney-client or deliberative-process\nr\nu\no a 12 privilege over 84 documents considered by Secretary Duke but not included in the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 67; 71-2).  Nevertheless, defendants argue that privilege logs\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 are not generally required in connection with an administrative record and that one should not\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 be required here.    \nS N 16   Our court of appeals has not spoken on the issue.  Every court in this district\nted  For the  17 considering the issue, however, has required administrative agencies to provide a privilege log. \ni\nn\nU\n18 See, e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15CV01590HSGKAW, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5\n19 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2017) (Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore) (“[C]ourts in this district have\n20 required parties withholding documents on the basis of the deliberative process privilege to, at a\n21 minimum, substantiate those claims in a privilege log.”); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No.\n22 16-CV-01574-VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017) (Judge Vince Chhabria);\n23 Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *4.  \n24\n25\n26\n27\n7  Although not addressed in the brief or at oral argument, the privilege log referenced personal privacy\nand executive privilege objections for certain documents.  No substantial privacy interest is implicated in any of\n28\nthe documents ordered to be produced below, nor do any of these documents fall within the executive privilege.  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 12 of 14\n1 “If a privilege applies, the proper strategy isn’t pretending the protected material wasn’t\n2 considered, but withholding or redacting the protected material and then logging the privilege.” \n3 Inst. for Fisheries Res., 2017 WL 89002 at *1.8 \n4 Courts outside this district that have determined no privilege log was required have done\n5 so on the grounds that the defendants’ judgment of what constitutes the administrative record is\n6 entitled to a presumption of correctness.  See San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell,\n7 No. 115CV01290LJOGSA, 2016 WL 3543203, at *19 (E.D. Cal. June 23, 2016) (Judge\n8 Lawrence O’Neill); Nat’l Ass’n of Chain Drug Stores v. United States Dep't of Health &\n9 Human Servs., 631 F. Supp. 2d 23, 27 (D.D.C. 2009).  Here, however, that presumption has\n10 been overcome by plaintiffs’ showing that defendants failed to include documents considered in\nt 11 arriving at the final decision to rescind DACA in the administrative record.  Therefore, even\nr\nu\no a 12 applying those courts’ logic, a privilege log would still be appropriate here.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Going forward, defendants shall comply with the standing order in this case and provide\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a privilege log for all documents withheld on grounds of privilege, which log shall include all\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authors and recipients of privileged documents, as well as other information set forth in the rule\nS N 16 (see Dkt. No. 23 ¶ 18).\nted  For the  17 RELIEF ORDERED\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ motion to complete the administrative record is GRANTED to the extent now\n19 stated.  Defendants are directed to complete the administrative record by adding to it all emails,\n20 letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions and other materials directly or indirectly\n21 considered in the final agency decision to rescind DACA, to the following extent:  (1) all\n22 materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by Acting Secretary Duke in connection\n23 with the potential or actual decision to rescind DACA (except as stated in the next paragraph\n24 below), (2) all DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the government)\n25 who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with written advice or input regarding the\n26\n8   In a memorandum opinion, our court of appeals denied a plaintiff’s request to require a privilege log. \n27\nSee Cook Inletkeeper v. EPA, 400 F. App'x 239,  240 (2010).  In that decision, however, our court of appeals\nfirst denied a motion to supplement the record, and finding that the plaintiffs had not presented evidence that the\n28\nagency had considered the documents the plaintiffs sought to compel, only then denied the accompanying\nmotion for preparation of a privilege log without further explanation.  \n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 13 of 14\n1 actual or potential rescission of DACA, (3) all DACA-related materials considered by persons\n2 (anywhere in the government) who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with verbal input\n3 regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA, (4) all comments and questions\n4 propounded by Acting Secretary Duke to advisors or subordinates or others regarding the actual\n5 or potential rescission of DACA and their responses, and (5) all materials directly or indirectly\n6 considered by former Secretary of DHS John Kelly leading to his February 2017 memorandum\n7 not to rescind DACA.\n8 The undersigned judge has balanced the deliberative-process privilege factors and\n9 determined in camera that the following materials from the government’s in camera\n10 submission, listed by tab number, shall be included in the administrative record: 1–6, 7 (only\nt 11 the header and material on pages 3–4 concerning DACA), 12, 14, 17–25, 27–30, 36, 39, 44, 47,\nr\nu\no a 12 49 (only the first paragraph, and the paragraph captioned “General”), 69–70, 73–74, 77, 79, 81,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 84.  The remainder of the in camera submission need not be included. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 If the government redacts or withholds any material based on deliberative-process, or\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 any other privilege in its next filing, it shall simultaneously lodge full copies of all such\nS N 16 materials, indicating by highlighting (or otherwise) the redactions and withholdings together\nted  For the  17 with a log justification for each.  The judge will review and rule on each item.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ insistence that defendants scour the Department of Justice and the White\n19 House for documents for inclusion in the administrative record is overruled except to the\n20 limited extent that DOJ or White House personnel fall within the category described in the first\n21 paragraph above as someone who gave verbal or written input to the Acting Secretary.  Nor do\n22 defendants have to search for DACA materials below the agency levels indicated in the first\n23 paragraph above.  These are intended as practical limits on what would otherwise be a bone-\n24 crushing expedition to locate needles in haystacks. \n25 This order, however, is not intended to limit the scope of discovery (as opposed to the\n26 scope of the administrative record).  The scope of discovery over and above the administrative\n27 record continues to be managed by Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim. \n28\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 39   Filed 10/17/17   Page 14 of 14\n1 The federal defendants shall file an amended administrative record in conformity with\n2 this order by NOON ON OCTOBER 27.   \n3 If any party plans to seek a writ of mandate and wants a stay pending appellate review,\n4 then a fresh motion to that effect must be made very promptly.\n5\n6 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n7\n8 Dated: October 17, 2017.                                                                  \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n9 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n14",

Defendants continue to take unlawful actions to diminish the protections that the \n3  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program provides for individuals who were \n4  brought to this country as children, in spite of the United States Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 \n5  decision finding Defendants’ 2017 rescission of DACA unlawful. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. \n6  Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1914–15 (2020) (Regents III). Defendants’ latest \n7  actions are unlawful for the same reason that the Supreme Court rejected the original rescission—\n8  they fail the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) core requirement that government action be \n9  rational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and sufficiently explained. This Court \n10  should invalidate these arbitrary and capricious actions, which are also unlawful because the \n11  officials who took them were not properly appointed to the positions they purportedly held.  \n12  2.  On July 28, 2020, Defendant Chad F. Wolf, purported Acting Secretary of the \n13  Department of Homeland Security, issued a memorandum making a number of changes to \n14  DACA. Ex. A, Mem. from Chad F. Wolf, Acting Sec’y of Homeland Security, to Mark Morgan, \n15  Senior Official Performing the Duties of Comm’r, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), et \n16  al., Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial \n17  Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (July 28, \n18  2020) (Wolf Memorandum). Pursuant to that memorandum, the Department of Homeland \n19  Security (DHS) reduced the period of deferred action and work authorization granted under the \n20  DACA program from two years to one year. DHS also again decided to reject any applications \n21  from individuals who had not previously received a grant of deferred action under DACA, and to \n22  reject requests for advance parole (i.e., authorization for DACA recipients to re-enter the United \n23  States after travelling abroad) except in extraordinary circumstances. DHS further decided to \n24  apply these policies to all initial DACA applications and applications for advance parole \n25  submitted before the issuance of the Wolf Memorandum but after the Supreme Court affirmed the \n26  vacatur of DHS’s 2017 rescission.  \n27  3.  On August 21, 2020, Defendant Joseph Edlow, purported Deputy Director for \n28  Policy for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), issued a memorandum \n \n  1   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 3 of 50\n \n1  implementing the Wolf Memorandum. Ex. B, Mem. from Joseph Edlow, Deputy Dir. for Pol’y, to \n2  Assoc. Dirs. and Program Off. Chiefs, Implementing Acting Secretary Chad Wolf’s July 28, 2020 \n3  Memorandum, “Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum ‘Exercising Prosecutorial \n4  Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children’” (Aug. 21, \n5  2020) (Edlow Memorandum). Under the terms of the Edlow Memorandum, USCIS will reject \n6  DACA renewal requests received more than 150 days (five months) prior to the expiration of \n7  DACA recipients’ current DACA validity period. As a result, many recipients will face lapses in \n8  the renewal of their DACA protections and accompanying work authorizations because of the \n9  lengthy processing times for renewal applications at USCIS centers, which currently extend up to \n10  14 months.  \n11  4.  Defendants’ actions are invalid, in part, because on July 28, 2020, when Defendant \n12  Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum, he was unlawfully exercising the functions and duties of the \n13  Secretary of Homeland Security, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, the Federal Vacancies \n14  Reform Act, and, as at least two courts have held, the Homeland Security Act. Moreover, \n15  Defendant Wolf’s subsequent attempts to ratify his actions are unavailing. \n16  5.  Defendants’ latest efforts to diminish the protections provided by the DACA \n17  program also violate the APA and significantly harm the Plaintiff States’ interests. The State of \n18  California is home to more DACA recipients than any other state by far, and the States of \n19  California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota (collectively, Plaintiff States) combined are \n20  currently home to more than 197,000 DACA recipients. Since 2012, this program has allowed \n21  nearly 800,000 people (including over 220,000 Californians) who have come of age in the United \n22  States—many of whom have known no other home—to study and work here without fear of \n23  removal, enriching our States and communities. As the Supreme Court recognized, “DACA \n24  recipients have ‘enrolled in degree programs, embarked on careers, started businesses, purchased \n25  homes, and even married and had children, all in reliance’ on the DACA program.” Regents III, \n26  140 S. Ct. at 1914 (quoting Br. for Resp’t Regents of Univ. of Cal. et al.).  \n27  6.  Further, an estimated 56,000 additional individuals (including tens of thousands in \n28  the Plaintiff States) have become eligible for DACA since Defendants’ 2017 rescission, but have \n \n  2   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 4 of 50\n \n1  been—and, under Defendants’ recent actions, will continue to be—prohibited from receiving \n2  DACA, despite the Supreme Court’s ruling, further harming the States. \n3  7.  DACA recipients residing in Plaintiff States are employed by companies and non-\n4  profits, large and small, as well as State and municipal agencies, all of which benefit from their \n5  skills and productivity. Through their employment and broader participation in the economy, \n6  DACA recipients contribute to the economic activity and tax base of Plaintiff States and the \n7  Nation. DACA recipients have also pursued educational opportunities at public and private post-\n8  secondary institutions within the Plaintiff States, enriching the educational experiences of all \n9  students and faculty by contributing their diverse life experiences and perspectives, while \n10  building their upward career mobility. In addition to substantially benefitting from DACA \n11  themselves, DACA recipients have taken advantage of the opportunities made available to them \n12  through DACA in ways that have significantly enhanced Plaintiff States. \n13  8.  As a direct result of Defendants’ recent decision to limit the eligibility period for \n14  deferred action and work authorization under DACA, DACA recipients are now required to \n15  demonstrate to their employers that they are authorized to work yearly rather than every two \n16  years. Approximately 56 percent of respondents to a survey of DACA recipients were concerned \n17  that this shortened eligibility period for DACA would make it more difficult for them to keep \n18  their jobs.1 Concomitantly, employers (including the States) will incur the administrative cost of \n19  verifying that their DACA recipient employees are authorized to work twice as often, effectively \n20  doubling their administrative costs and burdens. In light of the increased administrative costs and \n21  the additional uncertainty regarding the status of their DACA employees’ work authorizations \n22  caused by this change, some employers may find that hiring or retaining DACA employees will \n23  not merit the expenditure of substantial resources in hiring and training, and DACA recipients \n24  may lose or be unable to obtain employment.  \n25  9.  Moreover, the reduced window of time for DACA recipients to seek renewal under \n26 \n                                                           \n1 Lora Adams, et al., Presidents’ All. on Higher Educ. and Immigr., Discouraging and \n27 \nDenying Renewals: An Assessment on the Impact of the July 2020 DHS Memorandum on DACA \n(Sept. 29, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/y233qfqt. \n28 \n \n  3   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 5 of 50\n \n1  the Edlow Memorandum increases the probability that some DACA recipients’ work \n2  authorization will lapse while renewal requests are pending in light of the often-lengthy \n3  processing times for such requests, which could force employers to place DACA recipients on \n4  unpaid leave or terminate their employment. As a result of losing employment, DACA recipients \n5  face the loss of employer-based health insurance, which has not only benefited them and their \n6  families personally, but has reduced Plaintiff States’ expenditures on healthcare to uninsured \n7  people and enhanced public health overall.  \n8  10.  Some DACA recipients who are enrolled in colleges and universities may be \n9  forced to disenroll, because the barriers to employment created by the Wolf and Edlow \n10  Memoranda will create financial obstacles to maintaining enrollment. Forty percent of DACA \n11  recipients surveyed were concerned that having only one year of DACA would make it more \n12  difficult for them to stay in college.2 Others may disenroll simply because they will no longer be \n13  able to achieve career objectives commensurate with their skills and qualifications in light of the \n14  reduced length of DACA work authorization available. Those DACA recipients who choose to \n15  remain enrolled in school will be unable to participate equally in other opportunities generally \n16  available to students, such as paid internships and externships, as well as study abroad programs. \n17  This also harms the States’ post-secondary education systems, where thousands of DACA-\n18  eligible individuals are enrolled or have been admitted, and deprives other participants in these \n19  programs of DACA-eligible students’ diverse life experiences and perspectives.  \n20  11.  The State of California, recognizing the significant benefits that DACA brings to \n21  DACA recipients, their families, and communities, and the State as a whole, has long supported \n22  DACA applicants by providing fee payment assistance. To date, California has invested \n23  approximately $14.8 million in providing such assistance. The Wolf Memorandum’s reduction of \n24  the renewal period from two years to one year will dramatically increase the demand for these \n25  services by forcing DACA renewal applicants to pay the $495 renewal fee twice as frequently, \n26 \n                                                           \n2 Tom K. Wong et al., Ctr. for Am. Progress, Results from 2020 National DACA Study \n27 \n(Sept. 10, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/y48v2sjcf.  \n28 \n \n  4   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 6 of 50\n \n1  straining the State’s resources. According to a recent survey of DACA recipients, almost two-\n2  thirds of respondents were concerned that the cost of applying to renew DACA every year would \n3  be too much for them to afford.3 \n4  12.  Since the 2017 rescission, it is estimated that 56,000 young people have become \n5  eligible for DACA by “aging in” to the program or on other bases such as employment or \n6  education. Defendants have continued to deny DACA-eligible individuals the opportunity to \n7  receive DACA, which further harms the States, as these individuals’ contributions to the States \n8  will be limited. \n9  13.  Under the DACA program, recipients were authorized to apply for advance parole, \n10  which allowed them to return to the United States after traveling abroad for educational or work \n11  purposes, or to visit relatives when family emergencies arose. In 2017, Defendants abruptly \n12  terminated this authorization; pursuant to the Wolf Memorandum, Defendants are now rejecting \n13  all applications for advance parole absent undescribed “exceptional circumstances.” Ex. A, Wolf \n14  Mem., at 5. The Edlow Memorandum makes it clear that effectively all advance parole \n15  applications for educational- or employment-related purposes, or to visit family, will be denied. \n16  Ex. B, Edlow Mem., at 6-9. As a result, thousands of residents of Plaintiff States have been and \n17  will continue to be unable to travel abroad for these purposes.  \n18  14.  In short, Defendants’ unlawful actions to curtail DACA will harm hundreds of \n19  thousands of Plaintiff States’ residents, injure the States’ colleges and universities, hurt employers \n20  in the States (including the States themselves), disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory \n21  interests, and damage the economies and tax bases of Plaintiff States. \n22  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n23  15.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n24  16.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). A \n25  substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this district; \n26  Plaintiff State of California resides in this district; and no real property is involved in the action. \n27 \n                                                           \n3 Id. \n28 \n \n  5   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 7 of 50\n \n1  This is a civil action in which Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers of such an \n2  agency. \n3  17.  Intradistrict assignment is proper in San Francisco pursuant to Local Rules 3-2(c) \n4  and (d) because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the claim occurred \n5  in the City and County of San Francisco.  \n6  PARTIES \n7  PLAINTIFF STATE OF CALIFORNIA \n8  18.  The State of California, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \n9  sovereign State of the United States of America.  \n10  19.  Governor Gavin Newsom is the chief executive officer of the State. The Governor \n11  is responsible for overseeing the operations of the State and ensuring that its laws are faithfully \n12  executed. As the leader of the executive branch, the Governor is the chief of California’s \n13  executive branch agencies, including those whose injuries are discussed in this Complaint. Cal. \n14  Const. art V, § 1. \n15  20.  Attorney General Xavier Becerra is the chief law officer of the State. The Attorney \n16  General is responsible for protecting California’s sovereign interests, including its interest in \n17  enforcing California laws. Cal. Const. art V, § 13. \n18  21.  California is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has standing to bring this \n19  action because of the injury to its state sovereignty caused by Defendants’ diminishment of \n20  DACA, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its interests. \n21  22.  California is home to 395,000 DACA-eligible residents.4 As of July 2020, USCIS \n22  had approved 238,623 initial DACA applications and 555,895 renewals from immigrants residing \n23  in California. Ex. C, USCIS, Number of Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for \n24  Childhood Arrivals, Status, by Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Case Status: Aug. 15, 2012 to June 30, \n25  2020 (July 1, 2020) (USCIS Numbers). Thus, California is home to over 156,000 additional \n26 \n                                                           \n4 Migration Pol’y Inst., National and State Estimates of Immigrant Populations Eligible \n27 \nfor the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program (June 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y4gnghn5. \n28 \n \n  6   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 8 of 50\n \n1  individuals who are eligible for DACA but would face automatic rejection of their applications \n2  under the Wolf Memorandum. Nearly 30 percent of all DACA recipients in the entire country \n3  reside in California and California has by far the largest population of DACA recipients of any \n4  state. Id. It is estimated that 16,000 young people in California have become eligible for DACA \n5  by “aging in” to the program or on other bases such as employment or education since the 2017 \n6  rescission.  \n7  23.  California’s interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its residents, \n8  including their physical and economic health, extends to all residents, regardless of immigration \n9  status. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 3339(a); Cal. Gov’t Code § 7285(a); Cal. Health & Safety Code \n10  § 24000(a); Cal. Lab. Code § 1171.5(a). \n11  24.  California has an interest in ensuring public safety within its borders and \n12  protecting the rights of its residents by maintaining an effective law enforcement system. Like \n13  many local law enforcement agencies in California and throughout the Nation, the State has \n14  concluded that public safety is best protected when all members of its community—regardless of \n15  immigration status—are encouraged to report crimes and participate in policing efforts without \n16  fear of immigration consequences. California has further determined that the interests of public \n17  safety are best served by promoting trust between law enforcement and California residents, \n18  including members of the immigrant community. By deferring the possibility of immediate \n19  deportation, the DACA program removed a significant deterrent to immigrants approaching law \n20  enforcement when they have been victimized or have witnessed crimes. \n21  25.  California has an interest in promoting and preserving the public health of \n22  California residents. Defendants’ actions to curtail DACA will shrink the pipeline for health care \n23  workers, exacerbating the existing shortage of physicians and home healthcare workforce for \n24  seniors and people with disabilities. California can ill afford such an outcome, particularly in the \n25  midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; indeed, approximately 29,000 doctors, nurses, dentists, \n26  physician assistants, and other healthcare workers who have benefitted from DACA are on the \n27 \n28 \n \n  7   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 9 of 50\n \n1  front lines confronting the ongoing pandemic every day.5 Further, DACA-eligible individuals \n2  barred from filing applications face an increased risk of experiencing mental health conditions \n3  like depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts as they continue to face an uncertain future, which \n4  in turn will impact California’s healthcare system.  \n5  26.  The new limitations on the DACA program will also harm California’s interests in, \n6  and expenditures on, its educational priorities. California’s state universities and colleges have \n7  made significant investments in financial aid and other programs to support students with DACA, \n8  consistent with the interests of those institutions and the State in ensuring diversity and \n9  nondiscrimination. See Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1914 (discussing harms to “schools where \n10  DACA recipients study”). The University of California (“UC”) system has over 4,000 \n11  undocumented students, including approximately 1,700 current DACA recipients. It is estimated \n12  that between 54,000 and 100,000 undocumented students attend California’s community colleges, \n13  and 9,800 attend the California State Universities; a significant number of these students are \n14  DACA recipients. The Wolf Memorandum’s requirement that students with DACA renew on an \n15  annual basis, instead of every two years, increases the risk that their DACA protections will lapse, \n16  making it more difficult or impossible for students to continue their studies and in turn harming \n17  the States’ investments and interests. \n18  27.  Further, the Wolf Memorandum’s change to DACA eligibility threatens significant \n19  additional harms to California’s community college system by pushing students out of education, \n20  depriving the system of significant revenues and wasting significant investments that the State has \n21  made in these students. In 2018-2019, undocumented students and those with DACA accounted \n22  for between 2.1 million and 3.4 million credits attempted and between 750,000 and 2.2 million \n23  noncredit course enrollments at the California Community Colleges. Further, in 2018-2019, the \n24  California Community Colleges provided between 450,000 and 900,000 noncredit enrollments to \n25  students who were working toward credentials that would allow them to become DACA eligible. \n26 \n                                                           \n5 See Nicole Prchal Svajlenka, Ctr. for Am. Progress, A Demographic Profile of DACA \n27 \nRecipients on the Frontlines of the Coronavirus Response (Apr. 6, 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y7c8ky88. \n28 \n \n  8   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 10 of 50\n \n1  Further marginalizing these students by reducing their opportunities to obtain or renew their \n2  DACA would constitute a significant risk of revenue loss to the California Community Colleges, \n3  amounting to millions of dollars annually.  \n4  28.   Further, the Wolf Memorandum’s denial of DACA to thousands of individuals \n5  who are eligible will make it difficult or impossible for these otherwise qualified young people to \n6  enter the States’ post-secondary institutions due to their inability to work, and thus support tuition \n7  and other costs of higher education. As many as 1,700 undocumented students in the UC system, \n8  2,540 in the California State University system, and at least 27,000 students in the California \n9  Community Colleges system are individuals who are DACA-eligible, but are barred from \n10  receiving DACA under the Wolf Memorandum. \n11  29.  UC also employs many DACA recipients at UC campuses and in UC medical \n12  centers as teaching assistants, research assistants, post-doctoral researchers, and health care \n13  providers. DACA recipients often possess valuable skills, including fluency in foreign languages \n14  that can be difficult for employers to replace. As a result of the Wolf Memorandum, UC (1) is \n15  only assured that these employees are eligible to work legally for one year, rather than two years, \n16  and (2) will lose the opportunity to employ individuals in these capacities who would have been \n17  eligible for DACA but whose initial applications will automatically be denied. See id. (discussing \n18  harms to “schools where DACA recipients . . . teach”).  \n19  30.  Similarly, California’s primary and secondary schools, as well as the California \n20  State University and California Community College systems, will be harmed because they \n21  currently employ professors, teachers, teachers’ aides, administrators, and nurses under DACA \n22  work authorizations. The Wolf Memorandum’s reduced renewal period frustrates California’s \n23  interests in the education of all its residents and harms Californians. Further, the Wolf \n24  Memorandum’s prohibition on the issuance of DACA to new applicants harms these schools \n25  because they are unable to hire individuals who would have been eligible for DACA but whose \n26  initial applications will now automatically be denied.  \n27  31.  Immigration is an important economic driver in California, the fifth-largest \n28  economy in the world. California is home to many small businesses, large corporations, non-\n \n  9   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 11 of 50\n \n1  profit organizations, public and private hospitals, and colleges and universities that will be \n2  adversely affected by the limitations imposed on DACA by Defendants.  \n3  32.  The cumulative economic harm to California from Defendants’ diminishment of \n4  DACA protections in the Wolf Memorandum is significant. According to one estimate, California \n5  will suffer over $2 billion in economic losses over a ten-year period as a result of Defendants’ \n6  denial of employment authorization to DACA-eligible individuals. See id. (discussing potential \n7  loss in economic activity from “excluding DACA recipients from the lawful labor force”). \n8  33.  DACA recipients also contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues. See \n9  id. (discussing $1.25 billion annual loss in tax revenue to state and local governments from \n10  rescission). DACA recipients average higher earning capacities than their undocumented peers \n11  and are able to better contribute to the economy. Studies show that after receiving DACA, many \n12  recipients purchase houses and cars for the first time, boosting the economy and generating state \n13  and local tax revenues. According to one estimate, DACA-eligible residents contribute more than \n14  $534 million annually in state and local taxes in California. California state and local \n15  governments stand to lose an estimated $262 million in tax revenues over ten years if DACA-\n16  eligible individuals are denied the ability to receive employment authorization through DACA.  \n17  34.  Shortening the work authorization period provided under DACA from two years to \n18  one year will increase costs for employers (including the State of California, as discussed below). \n19  First, the decreased work authorization period will put the “significant investments in hiring and \n20  training” DACA recipients that employers have made, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of \n21  Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1033 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (Regents I), at risk of being lost \n22  after just one year. Second, the shortened work authorization period will impose administrative \n23  costs on employers by requiring them to verify DACA recipients’ employment every year, rather \n24  than every two years. Third, given the generally lengthy, multi-month processing times for \n25  DACA renewal requests, the more compressed window of time for DACA recipients to seek \n26  renewal of their work authorization under the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda increases the \n27  probability that some DACA recipients’ work authorization will lapse while timely renewal \n28 \n \n  10   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 12 of 50\n \n1  requests are pending, forcing employers to place employees on leave or terminate their \n2  employment and imposing additional costs to hire and train replacements.  \n3  35.  Some of the largest companies in California, and indeed, the Nation, have been \n4  vocal in support of DACA recipients, urging the President to retain DACA and not undermine its \n5  protections. More than 140 employers and trade associations from different and varied American \n6  industries signed on to a letter earlier this year under the banner of an organization called \n7  Coalition for the American Dream, calling on the President to “leave DACA in place and refrain \n8  from taking any additional administrative actions that would negatively impact the DACA \n9  program,” which they state would both “disrupt the economic recovery of our companies and \n10  communities, [and] jeopardize the health and safety of these vulnerable individuals.”6  \n11  36.  California, too, has an interest in ensuring that it has access to the best possible \n12  employees—including current and prospective DACA recipients—as well as fully realizing its \n13  investments in the employees it recruits, hires, and trains. The State employs at least 288 DACA \n14  recipients across 26 agencies and departments, many of whom were hired because of their \n15  specialized skills and qualifications and who will be affected by the limitations imposed on \n16  DACA. These state employees help further California’s priorities to ensure, inter alia: public \n17  safety at the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Department of Forestry and \n18  Fire Protection; public health at the Departments of Health Care Services, State Hospitals, and \n19  Developmental Services; infrastructure at the Departments of Transportation and Water \n20  Resources; and support for veterans at the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. In addition, the \n21  California State University system employs at least 645 DACA recipients in a variety of roles. \n22  California has expended time and funds to hire, train, and manage these DACA recipients.  \n23  37.  Cutting the renewal period for DACA recipients in half both reduces the value of \n24  the State’s investment by increasing uncertainty as to DACA recipients’ future employability, see \n25  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1033 (discussing “consequences . . . to the employers who have \n26                                                             \n6 Coal. for the Am. Dream, Letter to President Trump (July 11, 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y6bgchnr (including companies and organizations such as the U.S. Chamber \n27 \nof Commerce, General Motors, Target, Levi Strauss, Marriott, Molson Coors, Apple, Microsoft, \nFacebook, Amazon, Google, and Starbucks as signatories). \n28 \n \n  11   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 13 of 50\n \n1  invested time and money in training [DACA recipients]”), and increasing administrative costs to \n2  verify employment eligibility every year rather than every two years. For DACA recipients \n3  employed by the State of California, the additional employment verifications required by the \n4  Wolf Memorandum will require approximately two hours of state employee time per verification \n5  to verify continued employment eligibility and update the corresponding employee file, taking an \n6  estimated total 575 hours of state employee time, at an additional cost to the State of \n7  approximately $21,558 annually. In addition, some State agencies may need to incur the \n8  administrative burden of terminating the employment of these individuals when their work \n9  authorization expires and expending resources to find, hire, and train replacement employees, at \n10  an average cost per employee of $15,000. The California State University system estimates that \n11  its costs would increase by more than $57,000 per year.  \n12  38.  State agencies that provide assistance to DACA recipients in the form of funding \n13  for application fees face additional time and resource expenditures as a result of higher renewal \n14  fees and shorter renewal periods associated with the Wolf Memorandum. For example, the \n15  California Department of Social Services’ (CDSS) DACA Legal Services Program has provided \n16  over $14 million to cover the cost of DACA application fees for over 28,000 individuals through \n17  FY 2019-20. Based on CDSS’s experience with high demand and unmet need for DACA \n18  recipients to pay renewal fees, and the anticipated increase in costs to recipients due to the annual \n19  renewal requirement, the State of California will likely expend millions more in future assistance \n20  than it would have in the absence of the Wolf Memorandum. \n21  39.  Defendants’ actions in severely limiting DACA recipients’ ability to receive \n22  advance parole for educational or employment purposes also harms the State of California, \n23  because it impacts, for example, the ability of students at California’s public universities to study \n24  abroad, the ability of faculty at California public universities to travel internationally for \n25  conferences and research, and the ability of California state employees to travel abroad for State \n26  business. \n27  40.  In sum, Defendants’ actions limiting the period of deferred action available under \n28  DACA, effectively denying advance parole for DACA recipients, and rejecting initial \n \n  12   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 14 of 50\n \n1  applications for DACA harm the State of California through their effects on California residents \n2  with DACA, their families, and California businesses and institutions. \n3  PLAINTIFF STATE OF MAINE \n4  41.  The State of Maine, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \n5  sovereign State of United States of America. \n6  42.  The Attorney General of Maine, Aaron M. Frey, is a constitutional officer with the \n7  authority to represent the State of Maine in all matters and serves as its chief legal officer with \n8  general charge, supervision, and direction of the State’s legal business. Me. Const. art. IX, § 11; \n9  Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 5 § 191 et seq. The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting on \n10  behalf of the State and the people of Maine in the federal courts on matters of public interest. The \n11  Attorney General has the authority to file suit to challenge action by the federal government that \n12  threatens the public interest and welfare of Maine residents as a matter of constitutional, statutory, \n13  and common law authority. \n14  43.  Maine is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this action \n15  because of the injury to its State sovereignty caused by Defendants’ diminishment of DACA, \n16  including immediate and irreparable injuries to its interests. \n17  44.  Maine is home to an estimated 50 DACA recipients. An additional 50 residents are \n18  eligible for but not enrolled in DACA. As of July 2020, USCIS had accepted 135 renewal \n19  applications for the DACA program in Maine. Ex. C, USCIS Numbers. \n20  45.  On a national basis, fifty-five percent of DACA recipients are employed.7 \n21  Applying the rate of 55% to the 50 DACA recipients in Maine, it is estimated that 27 DACA \n22  recipients are employed in Maine. \n23  46.  Maine has an interest in hiring, training and retaining a qualified workforce. The \n24  State has extended an employment offer to a DACA recipient, which has been accepted. Cutting \n25  the renewal period for DACA recipients in half reduces the value of the State’s investments in \n26 \n27                                                             \n7 Jie Zong, et al., Migration Pol’y Inst., A Profile of Current DACA Recipients by \nEducation, Industry, and Occupation (Nov. 2017), https://tinyurl.com/ycxuhjru. \n28 \n \n  13   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 15 of 50\n \n1  hiring and training by increasing uncertainty as to this employee’s future employability, and that \n2  of other potential state employees. \n3  47.  Maine will suffer economic harm from Defendants’ diminishment of DACA \n4  protections in the Wolf Memorandum. DACA recipients average higher earning capacities than \n5  their undocumented peers and are able to better contribute to the economy. Studies show that \n6  after receiving DACA, many recipients purchase houses and cars for the first time, boosting the \n7  economy and generating state and local tax revenues. According to one estimate, Maine will incur \n8  $400,000 in economic losses over a ten-year period as a result of the limitations on DACA in the \n9  Wolf Memorandum. See Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1914 (discussing potential loss in economic \n10  activity from “excluding DACA recipients from the lawful labor force”).  \n11  48.  Through this economic activity, DACA recipients contribute to state and local tax \n12  revenues. See id. (discussing $1.25 billion annual loss in tax revenue to state and local \n13  governments from rescission). The additional 50 Maine residents who are DACA-eligible but not \n14  enrolled contribute over $178,600 in Maine state and local taxes annually. They contribute over \n15  $41,800 in state and local taxes annually, bringing the total annual tax contributions of the 100 \n16  DACA-eligible Maine residents to over $220,400. According to one estimate, Maine state and \n17  local governments stand to lose over $53,000 in tax revenues over ten years if DACA-eligible \n18  individuals are denied the ability to receive employment authorization through DACA.  \n19  49.  Shortening the work authorization period provided under DACA from two years to \n20  one year will increase costs for employers. First, the decreased work authorization period will put \n21  the “significant investments in hiring and training” DACA recipients that employers have made, \n22  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1033, at risk of being lost after just one year. Second, the shortened \n23  work authorization period will impose administrative costs on employers by requiring them to \n24  verify DACA recipients’ employment authorization each year, rather than once every two years. \n25  Third, given the lengthy multi-month processing times for DACA renewal requests, the more \n26  compressed window of time for DACA recipients to seek renewal of their work authorization \n27  under the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda increases the probability that some DACA recipients’ \n28  work authorization will lapse while timely renewal requests are pending, forcing employers to \n \n  14   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 16 of 50\n \n1  place employees on leave or terminate their employment and imposing additional costs to hire \n2  and train replacements.  \n3  50.  The reduced window of time for DACA recipients to seek renewal under the \n4  Edlow Memorandum increases the probability that some DACA recipients’ work authorization \n5  will lapse while renewal requests are pending in light of the often lengthy processing times for \n6  such requests, which could force employers to place DACA recipients on unpaid leave or \n7  terminate their employment.  \n8  51.  As a result of losing employment, DACA recipients face the loss of employer-\n9  based health insurance. Without employer-based benefits, more Maine residents are likely to \n10  refrain from seeking needed medical care. As a result of forgoing treatment, including for \n11  preventative purposes, these residents will impose higher healthcare costs on Maine. \n12  PLAINTIFF STATE OF MARYLAND \n13  52.  The State of Maryland is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n14  53.  The State is represented by and through the Attorney General of Maryland, Brian \n15  Frosh, its chief legal officer with general charge, supervision, and direction of the State’s legal \n16  business. The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting on behalf of the State and the \n17  people of Maryland in the federal courts on matters of public concern. Under the Constitution of \n18  Maryland, and as directed by the Maryland General Assembly, the Attorney General has the \n19  authority to file suit to challenge action by the federal government that threatens the public \n20  interest and welfare of Maryland residents. Md. Const. art. V, § 3(a)(2); 2017 Md. Laws, Joint \n21  Resolution 1.  \n22  54.  Maryland is aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and has standing to bring this action \n23  because of the injury to its State sovereignty caused by Defendants’ diminishment of DACA, \n24  including immediate and irreparable injuries to its interests. \n25  55.  Maryland is home to an estimated 27,000 DACA-eligible residents.8 As of July \n26  2020, USCIS had accepted 11,504 initial applications and 24,560 renewal applications for the \n27 \n                                                           \n8 National and State Estimates, supra note 4. \n28 \n \n  15   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 17 of 50\n \n1  DACA program in Maryland. Ex. C, USCIS Numbers. Thus, Maryland is home to over 15,000 \n2  additional individuals who are eligible for DACA but would face automatic rejection of their \n3  applications under the Wolf Memorandum. \n4  56.  According to one estimate, Maryland will suffer over $98.9 million in economic \n5  losses over a ten-year period as a result of Defendants’ actions in denying DACA to new \n6  applicants.  \n7  57.  DACA-eligible individuals contribute more than $33.6 million per year in state \n8  and local taxes. Maryland state and local governments stand to lose an estimated $12 million in \n9  tax revenues over ten years if DACA-eligible individuals are denied the ability to receive \n10  employment authorization through DACA. \n11  58.  Maryland has a cognizable interest in protecting the economic health and welfare \n12  of its residents. More than 72% of Maryland’s undocumented immigrants aged 16 and older are \n13  employed,9 and Maryland is home to an estimated 5,000 employed DACA recipients.10 DACA \n14  recipients work for both large and small businesses, all of which are critical to the State’s \n15  economic vitality. In addition, DACA recipients in Maryland work in a wide array of fields, \n16  including healthcare, education, law, and social services.  \n17  59.  Shortening the work authorization period provided under DACA from two years to \n18  one year will increase costs for employers. First, the decreased work authorization period will put \n19  the “significant investments in hiring and training” DACA recipients that employers have made, \n20  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1033, at risk of being lost after just one year. Second, the shortened \n21  work authorization period will impose administrative costs on employers by requiring them to \n22  verify DACA recipients’ employment authorization each year, rather than once every two years. \n23  Third, given the often lengthy multi-month processing times for DACA renewal requests, the \n24  more compressed window of time for DACA recipients to seek renewal of their work \n25 \n                                                           \n9 Migration Pol’y Inst., Profile of the Unauthorized Population: Maryland, \n26  https://tinyurl.com/y4hecbew.  \n10 Migration Pol’y Inst., National and State Estimates of Employed Workers among \n27 \nCurrent Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Recipients (as of March 31, 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y2wj65pf.  \n28 \n \n  16   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 18 of 50\n \n1  authorization under the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda increases the probability that some DACA \n2  recipients’ work authorization will lapse while timely renewal requests are pending, forcing \n3  employers to place employees on leave or terminate their employment and imposing additional \n4  costs to hire and train replacements.  \n5  60.  As a result of losing employment, DACA recipients face the loss of employer-\n6  based health insurance. Without employer-based benefits, more Maryland residents are likely to \n7  refrain from seeking needed medical care. As a result of forgoing treatment, including for \n8  preventative purposes, these residents will impose higher healthcare costs on Maryland. \n9  61.  Maryland also has an interest in hiring and training a qualified workforce. Both the \n10  State and local jurisdictions employ DACA recipients, many of whom have specialized skills and \n11  qualifications. Cutting the renewal period for DACA recipients in half reduces the value of the \n12  State and local governments’ significant investments in hiring and training them by increasing \n13  uncertainty as to their future employability.  \n14  62.  The restrictions on DACA will adversely impact current DACA recipients enrolled \n15  in colleges and universities. These students’ educational and employment plans could be \n16  disrupted, if not aborted, by the Wolf Memorandum’s requirement to renew their DACA \n17  protections on an annual basis, instead of every two years, and will risk lapses in their DACA \n18  protections and work authorizations, making it more difficult or impossible for them to continue \n19  their studies.  \n20  63.  Disenrollment by DACA recipients will also harm Maryland’s public colleges and \n21  universities. An estimated 27% of all university and college students in Maryland are first or \n22  second-generation immigrants.11 The University System of Maryland has emphasized that the \n23  DACA program is “critical to the growth and prosperity of our state and our nation” and “remains \n24  a key component” of the University System’s “strategy to foster a highly skilled workforce that \n25  will help attract and create jobs.”12 In 2011, Maryland passed a law allowing undocumented \n26                                                             \n11 Jeanne Batalova & Miriam Feldblum, Migration Pol’y Inst., Immigrant-Origin Students \nin U.S. Higher Education: A Data Profile (Oct. 2020), https://tinyurl.com/y56bl3yp.  \n27 \n12 Univ.

In the 2019-20 academic year, over 600 Dreamers were enrolled in Maryland \n4  public colleges at in-state tuition rates.13 The restrictions on DACA will make it more difficult or \n5  impossible for students to continue their studies, harming both the individual students as well as \n6  their schools. Maryland’s public institutions will lose the diversity and enrichment this population \n7  brings to the school community. \n8  64.  Defendants’ actions in severely limiting DACA recipients’ ability to receive \n9  advance parole for educational or employment purposes also harms the State of Maryland, \n10  because it impacts, for example, the ability of students at Maryland’s public universities to study \n11  abroad, the ability of faculty at Maryland’s public universities to travel internationally for \n12  conferences and research, and the ability of Maryland state employees to travel abroad for State \n13  business. \n14  65.   DACA’s value to Maryland’s economy and its education system will be \n15  diminished significantly, and the State and its residents will incur increased administrative and \n16  other costs, due to limitations imposed under the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda, including denial \n17  of DACA benefits to thousands of eligible individuals, a more compressed window of time for \n18  DACA recipients to seek renewal of their work authorization, shortening of the work \n19  authorization period provided under DACA from two years to one year, and rejection of pending \n20  and future applications for advance parole. \n21  PLAINTIFF STATE OF MINNESOTA \n22  66.  The State of Minnesota, represented by and through its Attorney General, is a \n23  sovereign State of the United States of America. \n24  67.  Attorney General Keith Ellison is the chief legal officer of the State of Minnesota. \n25  The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting in federal court in matters of State \n                                                           \n26  Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program (June 18, 2020), \nhttps://www.usmd.edu/newsroom/news/2058.  \n27 \n13 Sec’y James D.

Minn. Stat. § 8.01. \n2  68.  Minnesota is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has standing to bring this \n3  action because of the injury to its state sovereignty caused by Defendants’ rescission of DACA, \n4  including immediate and irreparable injuries to its interests. \n5  69.  Minnesota is home to an estimated 12,000 DACA-eligible residents.14 As of July \n6  2020, USCIS had approved 6,500 initial DACA applications from individuals residing in \n7  Minnesota. Ex. C, USCIS Numbers. Thus, Minnesota is home to over 5,000 additional \n8  individuals who are eligible for DACA but would face automatic rejection of their applications \n9  under the Wolf Memorandum. \n10  70.  Minnesota has cognizable interests in protecting the health and well-being, both \n11  economic and physical, of all its residents.  \n12  71.  The new limitations on the DACA program will harm Minnesota’s interests in, and \n13  expenditures on, its educational priorities. Minnesota seeks to extend educational opportunities to \n14  all of its residents, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, the Minnesota Legislature passed \n15  the Prosperity Act (commonly referred to as the “Minnesota Dream Act”). Prosperity Act, ch. 99, \n16  art. 4, 2013 Minn. Laws. This legislation changed the definition of a resident student under \n17  Minnesota law to include DACA recipients and other individuals without lawful immigration \n18  status. See Minn. Stat. § 135A.043. Minnesota has chosen to extend benefits to DACA recipients, \n19  including eligibility for resident tuition rates. Id. Importantly, the Minnesota Dream Act’s \n20  inclusion of DACA recipients as Minnesota residents for postsecondary education purposes has \n21  made DACA recipients eligible for state grants, aid, and scholarships. See Minn. Stat. Ch. 136A. \n22  Minnesota has further invested in the education of individuals holding DACA by extending \n23  student child care grants, teacher candidate grants, and student loan programs to DACA \n24  recipients. Minn. Stat. §§ 136A.125, .1275, .15-.1795. \n25  72.  Minnesota has invested in supporting post-secondary students with DACA. The \n26  Minnesota Office of Higher Education (“OHE”) is a state agency providing students with \n27 \n                                                           \n14 National and State Estimates, supra note 4. \n28 \n \n  19   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 21 of 50\n \n1  financial aid programs and other assistance to gain access to postsecondary education. OHE \n2  proactively works to improve access to the state educational benefits made available to DACA \n3  recipients through the Minnesota Dream Act, including through a state financial aid application \n4  specific to DACA recipients and undocumented students.  \n5  73.  Minnesota’s state colleges and universities have likewise invested in financial aid \n6  and other programs to support DACA recipients. These investments and expenditures are \n7  consistent with the interests of Minnesota’s state educational institutions—and those of the State \n8  itself—in diversity and nondiscrimination. See Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1914 (discussing harms \n9  to “schools where DACA recipients study”). The Wolf Memorandum’s reduction of students’ \n10  DACA protection from two years to one and the inevitable lapses in renewal of their DACA \n11  protections and work authorizations will harm these investments and interests by making it more \n12  difficult or impossible for impacted students to continue their studies.  \n13  74.  Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (“Minnesota State”) is the fourth largest \n14  system of two-year colleges and four-year universities in the nation. Minnesota State does not \n15  include the University of Minnesota. Minnesota State is comprised of 30 two-year and 7 four-year \n16  state colleges and universities with 54 campuses located in 47 Minnesota communities. The \n17  diversity of Minnesota State’s student body is one of its greatest assets. Of the credit students \n18  system-wide, 27% are students of color, 56% are women, 4% are students with disabilities, and \n19  30% are PELL eligible. In addition, 45.8% are the first in their families attending higher \n20  education. Minnesota State is a state entity governed by a 15-member Board of Trustees. \n21  Minnesota State’s operating statute is set forth in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 136F. In fiscal year \n22  2017, Minnesota State contributed over $8 billion to the State’s economy. Students who are \n23  DACA recipients or who otherwise meet the qualifications for DACA bring important vibrancy \n24  and perspective to Minnesota State’s campuses that add to the diversity of thought and experience \n25  critical to fostering the type of learning environments that Minnesota State students need and \n26  deserve. Minnesota State’s campuses are critical to the economic success of Minnesota’s regional \n27  and local economies. \n28  75.  OHE maintains information regarding the post-secondary students in Minnesota \n \n  20   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 22 of 50\n \n1  who have applied for state educational benefits pursuant to the Minnesota Dream Act. According \n2  to OHE’s data, 147 students attending the colleges and universities of Minnesota State are DACA \n3  recipients, and an additional 45 DACA recipients attend the separate University of Minnesota \n4  system.15 Other students attending Minnesota State and the University of Minnesota would be \n5  eligible to apply for DACA and would like to pursue DACA benefits but have been prevented \n6  from doing so because of the Wolf Memorandum and prior DHS memoranda, which have barred \n7  the acceptance of new initial applications for DACA.  \n8  76.  The Wolf Memorandum’s continued denial of DACA to individuals in Minnesota \n9  who otherwise meet the program’s criteria also makes it difficult or impossible for thousands of \n10  young people to enter the State’s post-secondary institutions. \n11  77.  The State of Minnesota and its public employers also employ DACA recipients. \n12  DACA recipients often possess valuable skills, including fluency in foreign languages, that can be \n13  difficult for employers to replace. As a result of the Wolf Memorandum’s limitations, the State of \n14  Minnesota is only assured that DACA recipient employees are eligible to work legally for one \n15  year, rather than two years, and the State of Minnesota has lost the opportunity to employ \n16  individuals who would have otherwise been eligible to submit an initial DACA application. \n17  78.  Minnesota faces economic harm due to the diminishment of DACA protections in \n18  the Wolf Memorandum. As noted above, immigration is an important economic driver in \n19  Minnesota. Minnesota is home to businesses ranging from 16 companies listed in the Fortune 500 \n20  to small businesses struggling to survive through the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimates of DACA \n21  recipients employed within the State of Minnesota range from 3,000 individuals to over 5,400, \n22  and their contribution to Minnesota’s GDP is estimated at over $376 million annually.  \n23  79.  As these economic figures reflect, and as recognized by the Supreme Court, \n24  DACA recipients make significant contributions to state and local tax revenues. Indeed, the State \n25                                                             \n15 OHE verifies an individual’s DACA status as part of its administration of the state \nbenefits made available to DACA recipients pursuant to the Minnesota Dream Act. It should be \n26 \nnoted that these statistics reflect only those DACA recipients who have applied for the state \neducational benefits made available through the Minnesota Dream Act. DACA recipients \n27 \nattending Minnesota State or the University of Minnesota who have not applied for Minnesota \nDream Act benefits are not included in these statistics. \n28 \n \n  21   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 23 of 50\n \n1  of Minnesota stands to lose an estimated $7,444,000 in state and local tax contributions over ten \n2  years if DACA-eligible individuals are denied the ability to receive employment authorization \n3  through DACA. \n4  80.  Shortening the work authorization period provided under DACA from two years to \n5  one year will increase costs for public employers in Minnesota. First, a decreased work \n6  authorization period puts the significant investments in hiring and training DACA recipients that \n7  employers have made at risk of being lost after just one year. Second, the shortened work \n8  authorization period will impose administrative costs on employers by requiring them to verify \n9  DACA recipients’ employment authorization yearly rather than every two years. Third, given the \n10  multi-month processing times for DACA renewal requests, the more compressed window of time \n11  for DACA recipients to seek renewal of their work authorization under the Wolf and Edlow \n12  Memoranda increases the probability that some DACA recipients’ work authorization will lapse \n13  while timely renewal requests are pending, forcing employers to place employees on leave or \n14  terminate their employment and imposing additional costs to hire and train replacements. \n15  81.  Large companies in Minnesota, including Target and Best Buy, have been vocal in \n16  support of DACA recipients, urging the President to retain DACA and not undermine its \n17  protections.16 Public employers in Minnesota also have an interest in ensuring that they have \n18  access to the best possible employees—including current and prospective DACA recipients—as \n19  well as fully realizing their investments in the employees they recruit, hire, and train. DACA \n20  recipients are employed by the State and other public employers across multiple entities and \n21  agencies in Minnesota. These employees will be affected by the DACA limitations imposed by \n22  Defendants.  \n23  82.  Defendants’ actions in severely limiting DACA recipients’ ability to receive \n24  advance parole for educational or employment purposes also harms the State of Minnesota, \n25  because it impacts, for example, the ability of Minnesota’s public university students to study \n26  abroad and the ability of Minnesota’s public employees to travel abroad for any business-related \n27 \n                                                           \n16 Coal. for the Am.

Defendants’ actions limiting the period of deferred action available under DACA, \n3  essentially terminating advance parole for DACA recipients, and denying initial applications for \n4  DACA harm the State of Minnesota through their effects on Minnesota residents, families, \n5  businesses, and institutions. \n6  DEFENDANTS \n7  84.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \n8  DACA program. DHS is a department of the Executive branch of the United States government, \n9  and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n10  85.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is the purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. \n11  He is purportedly responsible for implementing and enforcing immigration laws, and oversees \n12  DHS. He is the author of the July 28, 2020 memorandum restricting DACA. He is sued in his \n13  purported official capacity. \n14  86.  Defendant USCIS is a component of Defendant DHS responsible for \n15  implementing the DACA program. USCIS is the federal agency that oversees lawful immigration \n16  to the United States and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). \n17  87.  Defendant Joseph Edlow is the purported Deputy Director for Policy of USCIS. \n18  He is the author of the August 21, 2020 memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum. He \n19  is sued in his purported official capacity. \n20  88.  Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n21  departments responsible for the implementation of the DACA program, including any actions to \n22  restrict, limit, or rescind the DACA program. \n23  ALLEGATIONS \n24  I.  ESTABLISHMENT OF DACA \n25  89.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \n26  memorandum establishing the DACA program. Ex. D, Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, \n27  Sec’y of DHS, to David V. Aguilar, Acting Comm’r, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n28  (“CBP”), et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \n \n  23   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 25 of 50\n \n1  United States as Children (June 15, 2012) (Napolitano Memorandum). Under the Napolitano \n2  Memorandum, individuals who were brought to the United States as children and met specific \n3  criteria could request deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal.  \n4  90.  The Napolitano Memorandum systematized the application of existing \n5  prosecutorial discretion for any applicant who satisfied each of the following criteria:  \n6  a.  Arrived in the United States under the age of sixteen;  \n7  b.  Had continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding the \n8  date of the memorandum and was present in the United States on the date of the memorandum;  \n9  c.  Was currently in school, had graduated from high school, had obtained a general \n10  education development certificate, or was an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or \n11  Armed Forces of the United States;  \n12  d.  Had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, \n13  multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise posed a threat to national security or public safety; \n14  and  \n15  e.  Was not above the age of thirty.  \n16  Id. at 1.  \n17  91.  According to the Napolitano Memorandum, DACA’s purpose was to ensure that \n18  DHS’s resources were appropriately allocated to individuals who were higher priorities for \n19  immigration enforcement. In that memorandum, Secretary Napolitano recognized that there are \n20  “certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \n21  home” and that immigration laws are not “designed to remove productive young people to \n22  countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language.” Id. at 1-2.  \n23  II.  DACA PROVIDES NUMEROUS BENEFITS  \n24  92.  DACA recipients are provided with numerous benefits. Most importantly, as \n25  individuals who are low priorities for enforcement, DHS will not place them in removal \n26  proceedings or remove them based solely on their immigration status during the designated period \n27  of their deferred action. See id. at 2-3.  \n28 \n \n  24   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 26 of 50\n \n1  93.  Pursuant to a separate regulation promulgated before DACA was adopted, DACA \n2  recipients, like other individuals granted deferred action, are granted eligibility to receive \n3  employment authorization. See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  \n4  94.  Also pursuant to a separate statutory and regulatory scheme, DACA opened the \n5  door for DACA recipients to travel for important purposes. DACA recipients were allowed to \n6  request—and routinely received—advance parole to legally return to the United States after brief \n7  trips abroad for limited purposes, such as to visit an ailing relative, attend funeral services for a \n8  family member, seek medical treatment, or further educational or employment purposes. 8 U.S.C. \n9  § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f). Leisure travel was not permitted.  \n10  95.  Separate statutory and regulatory authority also permits DACA recipients to \n11  receive certain public benefits, including federal Social Security, retirement, and disability \n12  benefits. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d); 8 C.F.R. § 1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 C.F.R.  \n13  § 417.422(h). DACA recipients are also eligible for state benefits; for example, in California \n14  DACA recipients are eligible for income assistance. \n15  96.  DACA recipients are able to secure equal access to other benefits and \n16  opportunities on which Americans depend, including opening bank accounts, obtaining credit \n17  cards, starting businesses, purchasing homes and cars, and conducting other aspects of daily life \n18  that are otherwise often unavailable for undocumented immigrants.  \n19  97.  DACA fundamentally changed the lives of DACA recipients. They have obtained \n20  employment, sought higher education, pursued career paths, and become fully contributing \n21  members of society who pay taxes and participate in civic life.  \n22  98.  Many DACA recipients have also started families here; there are “200,000 U.S.-\n23  citizen children” whose parents are legally in the United States thanks to DACA. Regents III, 140 \n24  S. Ct. at 1914. \n25  99.  The federal government has recognized that the United States “continue[s] to \n26  benefit . . . from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want \n27  nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Ex. E, Letter from Jeh \n28  Charles Johnson, DHS Sec’y, to Rep. Judy Chu, U.S. H. Rep. (CA-27) (Dec. 30, 2016). In fact, \n \n  25   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 27 of 50\n \n1  shortly after the attempted rescission in 2017, President Trump tweeted regarding DACA \n2  recipients: “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young \n3  people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!”.17 DACA recipients’ contributions \n4  to society have also generated benefits to many sectors of the Plaintiff States’ economies. See, \n5  e.g., Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1914. \n6  III.  DHS’S ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ATTEMPT TO RESCIND DACA IN 2017 \n7  100.  On September 5, 2017, then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke \n8  issued a memorandum rescinding DACA. Ex. F, Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke, Acting \n9  Sec’y of Homeland Security to James W. McCament, Acting Dir., USCIS, et al., Rescission of the \n10  June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \n11  Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (Sept. 5, 2017) (Duke Memorandum). \n12  Pursuant to that memorandum, DHS immediately began rejecting all new initial applications for \n13  DACA, immediately ceased granting advance parole, and declared that it would only issue \n14  renewals for current recipients whose DACA protection expired on or before March 5, 2018, and \n15  who applied for renewal by October 5, 2017. \n16  101.  Acting Secretary Duke asserted that DACA “should be terminated” based on \n17  consideration of two factors: (1) the appellate rulings in a case regarding a 2014 memorandum \n18  from then-DHS Secretary Johnson that expanded DACA and created a new program, Deferred \n19  Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), Texas v. United \n20  States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided court sub nom. United States v. \n21  Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); and (2) a September 4, 2017, letter from then-Attorney General \n22  Jefferson B. Sessions claiming that DACA was “unconstitutional” and was invalid for the same \n23  reasons the Fifth Circuit struck down DAPA in the Texas case. Ex. G, Letter from Jefferson B. \n24  Sessions to Duke (Sept. 4, 2017) (Sessions Letter). Other than these conclusory assertions of \n25  DACA’s legal infirmity, Acting Secretary Duke failed to offer any explanation of why she \n26  believed that rescinding DACA was warranted.  \n27                                                             \n17 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (Sept. 24, 2017, 3:28 a.m.) \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y63m36ez. \n28 \n \n  26   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 28 of 50\n \n1  102.  On September 11, 2017, Plaintiff States filed a complaint with this Court, \n2  requesting that it invalidate the Duke Memorandum on a number of grounds, including that \n3  DHS’s action was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. The States and other plaintiffs \n4  moved for a preliminary injunction, which this Court granted and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. See \n5  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2018), \n6  aff’d, 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. 2018) (Regents II), rev’d in part, vacated in part sub nom. Dep’t of \n7  Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020). On June 22, 2020, the \n8  Supreme Court affirmed a decision by the district court for the District of Columbia vacating the \n9  Duke Memorandum, holding that the action was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. \n10  Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1916.18 \n11  IV.  DEFENDANTS’ RECENT ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS DIMINISHING \nDACA PROTECTIONS \n12 \n13  103.  After the Supreme Court upheld the vacatur of the Duke Memorandum, on June \n14  30, 2020, Attorney General William Barr withdrew the Sessions Letter in a letter to Defendant \n15  Wolf, also stating that he had requested the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of \n16  Justice to withdraw earlier guidance that it had provided to DHS regarding DACA. Ex. H, Letter \n17  from William P. Barr to Chad F. Wolf (June 30, 2020). Attorney General Barr expressed no \n18  opinion as to the legality of DACA, but indicated that he wished to remove any determination that \n19  might constrain Defendant Wolf’s discretion in considering “whether and how to rescind \n20  DACA.” Id. Attorney General Barr stated that he wished “to wipe the slate clean to make clear \n21  beyond doubt that [Defendant Wolf was] free to exercise [his] own independent judgment in \n22  considering the full range of legal and policy issues implicated by a potential rescission or \n23  modification of DACA.” Id. \n24  104.  On July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a memorandum announcing that DHS \n25  would limit the period of deferred action and work authorization granted under DACA to one \n26                                                             \n18 During the pendency of this litigation, then-DHS Secretary Kirsten Nielsen issued a \nmemorandum purporting to “provid[e] a fuller explanation” of DHS’s rescission decision. \n27 \nRegents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1904. The Supreme Court held that this memorandum was an \n“impermissible post hoc rationalization[]” and thus not properly before the Court. Id. at 1909. \n28 \n \n  27   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 29 of 50\n \n1  year, accept no new applications for DACA, reject any pending initial applications for DACA, \n2  and reject all requests for advance parole absent exceptional circumstances. Ex. A, Wolf Mem. \n3  The Wolf Memorandum indicates that DHS made these “immediate changes” to “facilitate \n4  [Defendant Wolf’s] thorough consideration of how to address DACA in light of the Supreme \n5  Court’s decision,” id. at 1, as well as “mitigate [Defendant Wolf’s] concerns” about DACA \n6  pending his reconsideration of the policy as a whole, id. at 5.  \n7  105.  While only making passing mention of “significant questions of law and legal \n8  policy,” id. at 4—all but abandoning the concerns about legality that undergirded the Duke \n9  Memorandum—the Wolf Memorandum identifies several “enforcement policy” concerns that \n10  Defendant Wolf asserts could warrant a full rescission of DACA. However, the policy concerns \n11  identified by Defendant Wolf fail to provide a reasoned basis for the changes to DACA policy \n12  and practice in the Wolf Memorandum.  \n13  106.  First, Defendant Wolf asserts that rescinding DACA might “create a more pressing \n14  need for Congress to decide whether it wants to address” the concerns of DACA-eligible \n15  individuals as well as “other efforts to reform our immigration system in a manner that advances \n16  the national interest.” Id. at 4-5. The Executive’s desire to place political pressure on a co-equal \n17  branch of government to enact immigration reforms—including, apparently, changes to the \n18  immigration system unrelated to DACA—is not a rational basis for agency action impacting the \n19  lives of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients, and those of their families, employers, \n20  schools, and communities. Further, even assuming that this is a legitimate rationale, Defendant \n21  Wolf has not explained how the measures outlined in his memorandum (e.g., limiting renewals of \n22  deferred action and work authorization to one year, rather than two years), mitigate his asserted \n23  policy concern that Congress, not the executive, should enact policies like DACA. \n24  107.  Defendant Wolf further claims that he has “reservations as a matter of policy about \n25  setting out a list of detailed criteria, and maintaining a formal process, for non-enforcement” and \n26  claims that he is “concerned that doing so may tilt the scales in deciding which aliens should \n27  receive deferred action and may inhibit individualized consideration of each case, at least for a \n28  non-enforcement policy of this scale.” Id. at 5. Defendant Wolf’s cursory discussion is \n \n  28   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 30 of 50\n \n1  unsupported by any data or other supporting evidence to justify imposing the limitations on \n2  DACA contained in the Wolf Memorandum. This brief discussion cannot pass muster under the \n3  APA’s requirement for “reasoned analysis.” Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1913. This is particularly \n4  true given the robust precedent of DHS and its predecessor agencies’ use of deferred action for \n5  decades, including policies that could have impacted tens or hundreds of thousands of immigrants \n6  such as the Emergency Program for Hungarian Refugees and Family Fairness Program. See \n7  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1021–22; Regents II, 908 F.3d at 488–89. \n8  108.  Defendant Wolf also advances a concern that the existence of DACA encourages \n9  “illegal immigration” in general and of children specifically. Wolf Mem. at 5. However, the Wolf \n10  Memorandum contains no evidence suggesting that the existence of DACA has affected rates of \n11  migration either of children or in general. Indeed, as Defendant Wolf notes, children entering the \n12  United States today are ineligible for DACA, id. at 5; individuals must have lived in the United \n13  States since 2007 to be eligible. Again, Defendant Wolf also fails to explain how limiting \n14  renewals of deferred action and work authorization to one year, rather than two years, mitigates \n15  this asserted policy concern. \n16  109.  Moreover, in deciding to limit the DACA renewal period to one year, Defendant \n17  Wolf failed to consider important aspects of the problem at issue. These include the fact that (1) \n18  many DACA recipients seeking renewals already face lengthy delays in processing of their \n19  applications, and effectively doubling USCIS’s workload in this regard by reducing renewal times \n20  from two years to one will only exacerbate this problem; and (2) effectively doubling the fees for \n21  renewal requests will impose a significant financial burden on many DACA recipients. While \n22  Defendant Wolf briefly acknowledges that “shortening renewal periods . . . will increase[e] the \n23  total amount of renewal fees that an alien will be required to pay over a multi-year period,” id. at \n24  6, he fails to address this issue other than to suggest that “DHS personnel should consider whether \n25  it is possible to reduce renewal fees during this interim period of reconsideration.” Id. at 6-7. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  29   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 31 of 50\n \n1  Indeed, there is no indication that DHS has taken any steps to reduce the $495 fee, which USCIS \n2  claims “cannot be waived.”19  \n3  110.  Additionally, Defendant Wolf failed to consider other important aspects of the \n4  problem. These include the reliance interests of third parties, including state and local government \n5  agencies that employ DACA recipients, and the harms that Defendants’ actions impose on those \n6  third parties. See Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1913–14 (where longstanding policies have \n7  engendered reliance interests, such as the reliance interests of “employers who have invested time \n8  and money in training,” it is arbitrary and capricious to ignore them). Defendant Wolf asserts that \n9  such third parties will “continue to receive the same derivative benefits” under a one-year renewal \n10  period. Ex. A, Wolf Mem., at 6. This ignores the important fact that for an employer, the certainty \n11  that an employee is eligible to work legally for two years, rather than just one year, is highly \n12  valuable; employers have “invested substantial resources in hiring and training” such employees, \n13  and would “need to expend additional resources to hire and train replacements.” Regents I, 279 F. \n14  Supp. 3d at 1033. \n15  111.  Defendant Wolf also fails to consider other harms that this change will cause to \n16  third parties, including state agencies employing DACA recipients. Employers incur \n17  administrative costs and burdens to verify DACA recipients’ continuing eligibility for \n18  employment. Cutting the renewal period in half will in turn double these costs to third parties, as \n19  employers now incur these costs every year rather than every two years. Further, the shortened \n20  renewal period, combined with the months-long processing times for DACA renewal requests, \n21  increases the probability that DACA recipients’ work authorizations will lapse. This could force \n22  employers to terminate DACA recipients’ employment and to incur additional costs to hire and \n23  train their replacements, or to place DACA recipients on administrative leave and lose these \n24  employees’ valuable services during their period of ineligibility.  \n25  112.  On August 21, 2020, Defendant Joseph Edlow, purported Deputy Director for \n26                                                             \n19 USCIS, I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/i-821d (last reviewed/updated: Aug. 4, 2020). The Edlow Memorandum \n27 \nonly acknowledges that “USCIS is currently considering the merits and feasibility of reducing \nDACA-related fees.” Ex. B, Edlow Mem., at 5-6. \n28 \n \n  30   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 32 of 50\n \n1  Policy for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, issued a memorandum implementing the \n2  Wolf Memorandum. Ex. B, Edlow Mem. The Edlow Memorandum (1) establishes a policy that \n3  “USCIS will generally reject DACA renewal requests received more than 150 days prior to the \n4  expiration of the DACA recipients’ current DACA validity period”; (2) states that USCIS will \n5  reject all advance parole applications filed before the Wolf Memorandum; and (3) provides that, \n6  in most instances, USCIS will reject advance parole requests to travel abroad for educational or \n7  employment-related purposes, or to visit family members. Id. \n8  113.  The Edlow Memorandum’s provision that USCIS will reject DACA renewal \n9  requests received more than 150 days (five months) prior to the expiration of the DACA \n10  recipients’ current DACA validity period will create serious problems for many DACA \n11  recipients. Current USCIS estimates show that DACA renewal processing times vary widely, \n12  between 2 months to 14 months. For example, as of October 29, 2020, the USCIS Vermont \n13  Processing Center was processing DACA renewal applications from September 3, 2019, and \n14  estimated that a DACA renewal application would be processed in 11 to 14 months.20 Reflecting \n15  this lengthy process, up to 11 percent of respondents to recent surveys of DACA recipients \n16  indicated that it took longer than 150 days for their DACA renewal application to be approved.21 \n17  Further, on August 25, 2020, USCIS announced plans to undertake “[a]ggressive spending \n18  reduction measures,” which “will impact all agency operations,” including “longer case \n19  processing times.”22 Given the shortened eligibility period, USCIS’s already lengthy processing \n20  times, the expected further delays in processing times, and the fact that USCIS will reject \n21  applications submitted more than 150 days before a DACA recipient’s grant expires, some \n22  recipients will face lapses in the renewal of their DACA grants and accompanying work \n23  authorizations. \n24  114.  Defendants failed entirely to consider this important aspect of the problem, \n25                                                             \n20 USCIS, Check Case Processing Times (I-821D Consideration for Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals), https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/. \n26 \n21 Wong, supra note 2 (8.5 percent); Adams, supra note 1 (11 percent). \n27 \n22 USCIS, USCIS Averts Furlough of Nearly 70% of Workforce (Aug. 25, 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y45yeejf.  \n28 \n \n  31   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 33 of 50\n \n1  ignoring altogether that their actions will undermine the purpose and value of many DACA \n2  recipients’ work authorizations by causing those authorizations to lapse (and, in turn, resulting in \n3  termination or unpaid administrative leave for DACA recipients). \n4  V.  DEFENDANT WOLF’S APPOINTMENT IS CONTRARY TO FEDERAL LAW AND THE U.S. \nCONSTITUTION \n5 \n6  115.   Defendant Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum in exercise of the functions and \n7  duties of the office of the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, Defendant Wolf was not \n8  authorized to exercise such functions and duties under the U.S. Constitution, the Homeland \n9  Security Act, or the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Accordingly, the Wolf Memorandum is \n10  without force or effect, may not be ratified, and was issued in excess of statutory authority or \n11  otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA. \n12  A.  Defendant Wolf’s Purported Service as Acting Secretary Violates the \nAppointments Clause \n13 \n14  116.  The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that principal officers \n15  of the United States be appointed by the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n16  Senate.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. The Appointments Clause is a critical element of the U.S. \n17  Constitution’s separation of powers. The “advice and consent” requirement is “an excellent check \n18  upon a spirit of favoritism in the President” and “the necessity of [the Senate’s] co-operation in \n19  the business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of” \n20  the President. The Federalist No. 76 (Alexander Hamilton). “The Framers understood . . . that by \n21  limiting the appointments power, they could ensure that those who wielded it were accountable to \n22  political force and the will of the people.” Freytag v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, \n23  884 (1991). \n24  117.  DHS is an Executive Department and the Secretary of Homeland Security is a \n25  principal officer who must be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of \n26  the Senate under both the Appointments Clause and federal statute. 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1). Such \n27  offices are commonly known as “presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed” (PAS) offices. \n28  118.  Despite this, there has not been a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland \n \n  32   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 34 of 50\n \n1  Security since the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on or about April 10, 2019, nearly 19 \n2  months ago.  \n3  119.  A number of other DHS offices are also PAS offices, including the Deputy \n4  Secretary, the Under Secretary for Management, the General Counsel, the Commissioner of CBP, \n5  the Director of USCIS, and the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 6 \n6  U.S.C. § 113(a)(1).  \n7  120.  Currently, the offices of Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary for Management, \n8  the General Counsel, the Commissioner of CBP, the Director of USCIS, and the Director of ICE \n9  are all vacant, with various individuals purporting to exercise the functions and duties of those \n10  offices under the title of “Senior Official Performing the Duties of” the offices. Nearly all of these \n11  offices have been vacant for more than a year. The office of Deputy Secretary has been vacant \n12  since April 14, 2018. The office of Under Secretary for Management has been vacant since April \n13  10, 2019. The office of General Counsel has been vacant since September 17, 2019. The office of \n14  Director of USCIS has been vacant since June 1, 2019. The office of Commissioner of CBP has \n15  been vacant since November 13, 2019. The office of Director of ICE has been vacant since \n16  January 20, 2017, the first day of President Trump’s presidency. \n17  121.  Upon information and belief, Congress has not provided for the position of “Senior \n18  Official Performing the Duties” of any executive office in any statute. \n19  122.  President Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to circumvent the \n20  requirements and accountability of the Appointments Clause by appointing acting officials. The \n21  President has stated that: \n22  a.  “Well, I’m in no hurry. I have ‘acting’ . . . I sort of like ‘acting.’ It gives me more \n23  flexibility; do you understand that? I like ‘acting.’”23 \n24  b.  “It’s easier to make moves when they’re acting . . . I like acting because I can \n25  move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.”24 \n26                                                             \n23 Felicia Sonmez, Trump Says He’s ‘in No Hurry’ to Replace Acting Cabinet Members, \nWash. Post (Jan. 6, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/y7v5fme3.  \n27 \n24 Transcript: President Trump on “Face the Nation,” CBS News (Feb. 3, 2019), \n28 \n \n  33   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 35 of 50\n \n1  c.  “Acting gives you much greater flexibility. A lot easier to do things.”25 \n2  d.  “I’m generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally \n3  be—because you don’t need them.”26 \n4  123.  By holding PAS positions, including the office of Secretary of Homeland Security, \n5  vacant for lengthy periods of time, while relying on acting officials to perform the functions and \n6  duties of those offices, Defendants have violated the Appointments Clause. See United States v. \n7  Eaton, 169 U.S. 331, 333 (1898) (acting officials may be designated only “for a limited time, and \n8  under special and temporary conditions”). \n9  124.  Defendant Wolf purports to serve as Acting Secretary pursuant to a designation by \n10  CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who was at the time of the designation purporting to \n11  serve as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. \n12  125.  Although the Appointments Clause requires that principal officers be appointed by \n13  the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Clause permits Congress to vest the \n14  appointment of “inferior Officers . . . in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads \n15  of Departments.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Acting officers are designated pursuant to this \n16  exception, rendering them inferior officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. \n17  United States v. Smith, 962 F.3d 755, 765 (4th Cir. 2020) (noting “the basic principle that acting \n18  heads of departments are not principal officers because of the temporary nature of the office”). \n19  Inferior officers lack the authority under the Appointments Clause to appoint other inferior \n20  officers; that power is reserved for the President, the courts, or Heads of Departments pursuant to \n21  a congressional authorization. \n22  126.  Because Commissioner McAleenan was merely purportedly the Acting Secretary \n23  of Homeland Security when he purported to amend the order of succession as described below, he \n24  was an inferior officer, and not a Head of Department. Accordingly, he lacked constitutional \n25                                                             \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y8l38g72.  \n26  25 Editorial Board, An Administration of Temps, Bloomberg Opinion (July 25, 2019), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yyuz3nzb.  \n27 \n26 Randall Lane, Inside Trump’s Head: An Exclusive Interview with the President, and the \nSingle Theory That Explains Everything, Forbes (Oct. 10, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/y5mlmxbn.  \n28 \n \n  34   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 36 of 50\n \n1  authority to appoint inferior officers, and his purported amendment of the order of succession to \n2  designate Defendant Wolf as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security violated the Appointments \n3  Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  \n4  127.  As of July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf had been neither nominated nor confirmed as \n5  Secretary of Homeland Security. On August 25, 2020, President Trump announced his intention \n6  to nominate Defendant Wolf to the position of Secretary of Homeland Security via Twitter.27 The \n7  nomination of Defendant Wolf was submitted to the Senate on September 10, 2020.  \n8  B.  Defendant Wolf’s Purported Service as Acting Secretary Violates the \nFVRA and HSA.  \n9 \n10  128.  Congress has recognized that while the nomination and confirmation process \n11  proceeds, someone must be authorized to act to ensure that federal agencies continue to function. \n12  To that end, Congress enacted the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”). In enacting the \n13  FVRA, Congress sought to safeguard its authority under the Appointments Clause to advise and \n14  consent to appointments. Nat’l Lab. Rel. Bd. v. SW General, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, 936 (2017). \n15  129.  The FVRA limits who may serve as an acting official if “an officer of an \n16  Executive Agency . . . whose appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with \n17  the advice and consent of the Senate . . . resigns.” 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). Although the default rule is \n18  that the “first assistant” will take on the acting role, the FVRA permits the President to select a \n19  Senate-confirmed appointee or certain agency employees instead. 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n20  130.  The FVRA provides that the President may direct a person to fill a vacant principal \n21  office in an acting capacity for no more than 210 days from the date of the vacancy, the \n22  submission of a nomination for the office, or from the rejection of a nomination. 5 U.S.C.  \n23  §§ 3345(a)(2), 3346. Once the time period runs out, “the office shall remain vacant” except in \n24  certain limited circumstances not applicable here. 5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).  \n25  131.  The FVRA is “the exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official \n26  to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive agency . . . for which \n27                                                             \n27 Donald J.

The Homeland Security Act (“HSA”) expressly designates a line of succession in \n6  the event that the Secretary of Homeland Security is unavailable to exercise the office. In the \n7  event of a vacancy, the duties of the Secretary are to be fulfilled first by the Deputy Secretary of \n8  Homeland Security, who is designated as the Secretary’s first assistant for the purposes of the \n9  FVRA. 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A). Then, if the office of Deputy Secretary is likewise vacant, the \n10  duties of the Secretary are to be fulfilled by the Under Secretary for Management. 6 U.S.C.  \n11  § 113(g)(1). The Secretary may designate a further order of succession if both of these offices are \n12  vacant. 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  \n13  133.  In February 2019, then-Secretary Nielsen designated an order of succession in the \n14  event of a vacancy resulting from the resignation of the Secretary of Homeland Security. That \n15  order of succession was never properly amended to permit either Defendant Wolf or his \n16  predecessor, Commissioner McAleenan, to serve as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. \n17  Accordingly, both Commissioner McAleenan’s and Defendant Wolf’s services as purported \n18  Acting Secretary violated the FVRA and the HSA, and actions taken by Defendant Wolf in \n19  exercise of the functions and duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security are without force or \n20  effect, may not be ratified, and are in excess of statutory authority.  \n21  134.  On February 15, 2019, then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen issued HSA Delegation \n22  00106, Revision No. 08.4. Ex. I (February Delegation). \n23  135.  The February Delegation included different orders of succession for the office of \n24  Secretary of Homeland Security for two different scenarios. First, Section II.A of the February \n25  Delegation provided that “[i]n case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform \n26  the functions of the Office, the orderly succession of officials is governed by Executive Order \n27  13753, amended on December 9, 2016.” Id. at § II.A. \n28  136.  Executive Order 13753, in turn, set the order of succession, beginning with the \n \n  36   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 38 of 50\n \n1  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and the Under Secretary for Management. Executive \n2  Order Amending the Order of Succession in the Department of Homeland Security, 81 Fed. Reg. \n3  90,667 (Dec. 9, 2016). The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection was listed \n4  seventh in the order of succession. Id. Executive Order 13753 further provided that \n5  “[n]otwithstanding the provisions of this section, the President retains discretion, to the extent \n6  permitted by the Vacancies Act, to depart from this order in designating an acting Secretary.” Id. \n7  137.  The February Delegation further provided that in the event the Secretary was \n8  “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency,” the Secretary’s powers are \n9  delegated to the officials listed in Annex A to the Delegation, in the order listed. February \n10  Delegation at § II.B. \n11  138.  The February Delegation further provided that “[u]nless formally appointed by the \n12  Secretary, persons appointed on an acting basis, or on some other temporary basis, are ineligible \n13  to serve as a successor; therefore, the order of succession would fall to the next designated official \n14  in the approved order of succession.” Id. at § II.G. \n15  139.  On April 7, 2019, then-Secretary Nielsen submitted a letter of resignation, \n16  “effective April 7th 2019.” Letter from Kirstjen Nielsen, U.S. Sec’y of Homeland Security, to \n17  President Donald J. Trump (Apr. 7, 2019). That evening, President Trump tweeted “Secretary of \n18  Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for \n19  her service . . . I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and \n20  Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting Secretary for @dhsgov.”28 However, later \n21  that evening, then-Secretary Nielsen tweeted that she had “agreed to stay on as Secretary through \n22  Wednesday, April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are \n23  not impacted.”29  \n24  140.  On or about April 10, 2019, then-Secretary Nielsen amended Annex A to \n25  Delegation No. 00106, titled “Order for Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of the \n                                                           \n26  28 Donald J.

Ex. J, HSA Delegation 00106, Revision No. 08.5 (April \n4  Delegation). \n5  141.  However, then-Secretary Nielsen did not amend the provision in Section II.A. of \n6  the Delegation for the order of succession in the event of the Secretary’s resignation. \n7  Accordingly, pursuant to the April Delegation, the order of succession in the event of the \n8  Secretary’s resignation was governed by Executive Order No. 13753. \n9  142.  On April 11, 2019, Kevin McAleenan, who was serving as the Commissioner of \n10  CBP, began serving as the purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. Defendant DHS has \n11  claimed that Commissioner McAleenan took the position of Acting Secretary of Homeland \n12  Security pursuant to the April Delegation. However, two Senate-confirmed officers who were \n13  listed fourth and sixth in the order of succession outlined in Executive Order No. 13753—\n14  Christopher Krebs, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and \n15  David Glawe, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis—were serving on the date that \n16  Commissioner McAleenan purportedly took the position. Commissioner of CBP was listed \n17  seventh in the order of succession outlined in Executive Order No. 13753. Accordingly, \n18  Commissioner McAleenan’s designation as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security was not valid \n19  under the HSA. \n20  143.  On November 8, 2019, the 212th day of McAleenan’s tenure as purported Acting \n21  Secretary of Homeland Security, he purported to amend Section II.A. of Delegation No. 00106, \n22  specifying that Annex A governed the order of succession in the event of the Secretary’s \n23  resignation and elevating the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to fourth in the order \n24  of succession. Ex. K, DHS, Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for Named \n25  Positions, Delegation No. 00106, Revision No. 08.6 (Nov. 8, 2019) (November Delegation). Such \n26  an amendment would have been superfluous had Secretary Nielsen’s order already accomplished \n27  this goal. \n28 \n \n  38   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 40 of 50\n \n1  144.  As multiple district courts have held, because Commissioner McAleenan’s \n2  purported succession was not authorized by Executive Order No. 13753, the February Delegation, \n3  or the HSA, Commissioner McAleenan lacked lawful authority to exercise the powers or \n4  authority of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, including amending the order of succession \n5  to the office of Secretary of Homeland Security. Accordingly, Commissioner McAleenan’s \n6  purported November Delegation was without force or effect. See Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr. v. \n7  Wolf, No. 20-CV-05883-JSW, 2020 WL 5798269, at *7–9 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2020); Casa de \n8  Maryland, Inc. v. Wolf, No. 8:20-CV-02118-PX, 2020 WL 5500165, at *20–23 (D. Md. Sept. 11, \n9  2020). \n10  145.  Moreover, even if Commissioner McAleenan’s designation as Acting Secretary \n11  pursuant to the April Delegation and the HSA were proper, and to the extent that and even if he \n12  was designated Acting Secretary pursuant to the FRVA, he lacked authority to issue the \n13  November Delegation, as the 210-day time limit for service as Acting Secretary under the FVRA \n14  had passed and no nomination for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security had been \n15  submitted.  \n16  146.  Because the November Delegation was issued without lawful authority and was \n17  therefore without force or effect, the order of succession contained in the April Delegation and in \n18  Executive Order No. 13753 continued to govern upon Commissioner McAleenan’s resignation. \n19  On November 13, 2019, the first three offices in the order of succession contained in Executive \n20  Order No. 17573 were vacant; the fourth office, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \n21  Security Agency, was filled by Senate-confirmed appointee Christopher Krebs.30 Accordingly, \n22  pursuant to the HSA, the April Delegation, and Executive Order No. 13753, Director Krebs \n23  should have been designated as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. \n24  147.  Nevertheless, after Defendant Wolf’s nomination as Under Secretary for Strategy, \n25  Policy, and Plans was confirmed by the Senate on November 13, 2019, Defendant Wolf purported \n26                                                             \n30 At the time Executive Order No. 17573 was issued, the position of the Director of \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was called the Undersecretary for National \n27 \nProtection and Programs. The office was retitled pursuant to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \nSecurity Agency Act of 2018. 6 U.S.C. § 652(b). \n28 \n \n  39   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 41 of 50\n \n1  to begin serving as the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. However, Defendant Wolf’s \n2  designation as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security was improper and unlawful under the \n3  FVRA and HSA. \n4  148.  Furthermore, pursuant to the FVRA, Defendant Wolf cannot lawfully exercise the \n5  functions and duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security because the time limit for service in \n6  an acting capacity had expired prior to November 13, 2019. On November 7, 2019, the office of \n7  Acting Secretary had been vacant for 211 days without a nomination being submitted to the \n8  Senate. Accordingly, pursuant to the FVRA, the office was required to “remain vacant.” 5 U.S.C. \n9  § 3348(b)(1). \n10  149.  On November 15, 2019, the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland \n11  Security and the Acting Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a \n12  letter to the Comptroller General and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), expressing \n13  concerns about the legality of Defendant Wolf’s designation as Acting Secretary of Homeland \n14  Security. The letter requested an expedited review to determine whether Defendant Wolf and \n15  purported Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli were legally \n16  serving in those positions. A copy of the letter was sent to Defendant Wolf. \n17  150.  On August 14, 2020, the GAO issued a decision determining that Defendant Wolf \n18  was improperly designated as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security by reference to an invalid \n19  order of succession.

Gaynor, Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n4  Management Agency, issued an order purporting to amend the order of succession, relying on \n5  “any authority vested in [him] as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security,” and placing the Under \n6  Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans fourth in the line of succession. Ex. L, Order \n7  Designating the Order of Succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security (Sept. 10, 2020) \n8  (Gaynor Order). The Gaynor Order stated that “in accordance with the President’s advance \n9  exercise of his authority to name an Acting Secretary under the FVRA,” Gaynor was relying on \n10  “any authority [he] may have been granted by the FVRA to designate the order of succession for \n11  the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).”  Mr. Gaynor stated that his \n12  issuance of the order of succession terminated his authority, if any, under the FVRA. \n13  154.  On September 17, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a memorandum purporting to \n14  ratify “any and all actions involving delegable duties that [he had] taken from November 13, \n15  2019, through September 10, 2020.” Ratification of Department Actions, 85 Fed. Reg. 59,651 \n16  (Sept. 23, 2020).  \n17  155.  On October 7, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a second memorandum purporting to \n18  ratify actions taken by Commissioner McAleenan and Defendant Edlow, including the Edlow \n19  Memorandum. Ratification of Department Actions, 85 Fed. Reg. 65,653 (Oct. 16, 2020). \n20  156.  Under the FVRA, “an action taken by any person” who is unlawfully exercising \n21  the authority of a vacant office “in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant office . . . \n22  shall have no force or effect” and “may not be ratified.” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), (2); see also SW \n23  General, 137 S. Ct. at 938 n. 2 (noting “general rule that actions taken in violation of the FVRA \n24  are void ab initio”). Such actions have no force and effect and may not be ratified whether a \n25  person is purportedly exercising authority under the FVRA or under an agency-specific statute. \n26  See 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), (2) (referring to actions taken by a “person who is not acting under \n27  section 3345, 3346, or 3347”). \n28 \n \n  41   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 43 of 50\n \n1  157.  The HSA provides that “[t]he Secretary is the head of the Department and shall \n2  have direction, authority, and control over it” and that “[a]ll functions of all officers, employees, \n3  and organizational units of the Department are vested in the Secretary.” 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(2), (3). \n4  The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for “[e]stablishing national immigration \n5  enforcement policies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5). The Secretary of Homeland Security is \n6  also “charged with the administration and enforcement of . . . all . . . laws relating to the \n7  immigration and naturalization of aliens” and is required to “establish such regulations; . . . issue \n8  such instructions; and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his \n9  authority.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), (3). \n10  158.  In issuing the Wolf Memorandum, Defendant Wolf took an action in the \n11  performance of a function or duty of the vacant office of Secretary of Homeland Security. See Ex. \n12  A, Wolf Mem., at 3 (noting that the memorandum was issued “in the exercise” of Defendant \n13  Wolf’s purported “authority and discretion in establishing national immigration enforcement \n14  policies and priorities”). \n15  159.  Because Defendant Wolf was improperly and unlawfully designated as Acting \n16  Secretary of Homeland Security under the FVRA and HSA, he lacked authority to issue the Wolf \n17  Memorandum. \n18  160.  Moreover, on the date that the Wolf Memorandum was issued, July 28, 2020, the \n19  office of Secretary of Homeland Security had not been occupied by a Senate-confirmed appointee \n20  for 475 days, well beyond the time limit provided in the FVRA for service in an acting capacity.  \n21  161.  Because Defendant Wolf was improperly and unlawfully performing the functions \n22  and duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security on July 28, 2020, the Wolf Memorandum has \n23  no force or effect and may not be ratified, and Defendant Wolf’s purported ratification of that \n24  action is ineffective.  \n25  162.  In addition, because Defendant Wolf lacked authority under the U.S. Constitution, \n26  the FVRA, or the HSA to serve as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the issuance and \n27  implementation of the Wolf Memorandum was and is in excess of statutory authority or otherwise \n28  not in accordance with law pursuant to the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n \n  42   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 44 of 50\n \n1  163.  Among the recipients of the Wolf Memorandum is Defendant Joseph Edlow, \n2  purported Deputy Director of Policy at USCIS. Defendant Wolf purportedly designated \n3  Defendant Edlow as Deputy Director at USCIS on February 19, 2020. Because, for the reasons \n4  discussed above, Defendant Wolf lacked legal authority to perform the functions and duties of the \n5  Secretary of Homeland Security, he likewise lacked legal authority to designate Defendant Edlow \n6  to that position. In turn, because Defendant Edlow was improperly designated to the role of \n7  Deputy Director of Policy at USCIS, he lacked legal authority to issue the Edlow Memorandum, \n8  and the issuance and implementation of the Edlow Memorandum was and is in excess of statutory \n9  authority or otherwise not in accordance with law pursuant to the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n10  164.  With certain limited exceptions not applicable here, the FVRA prohibits a person \n11  from serving as an acting officer if the President submits to the Senate a nomination of that \n12  person to the office, and during the 365 days prior to the vacancy, the person was not first \n13  assistant to the office or was first assistant for less than 90 days. 5 U.S.C. § 3345(b)(1). Defendant \n14  Wolf has never served as first assistant to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Nevertheless, \n15  despite the submission of his nomination to the position of Secretary of Homeland Security to the \n16  Senate on September 10, 2020, Defendant Wolf continues to purport to serve as Acting Secretary \n17  of Homeland Security in violation of the FVRA. \n18  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n19  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706 \n20  CONTRARY TO LAW \n21  165.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n22  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n23  166.  The APA requires the Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n24  “(A) . . . not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \n25  immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n26  statutory right[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n27  167.  In issuing and implementing the Wolf Memorandum while Defendant Wolf was \n28  unlawfully performing the functions and duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security in \n \n  43   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 45 of 50\n \n1  violation of the Appropriations Clause, the FVRA, and the HSA, Defendants have acted not in \n2  accordance with law, contrary to constitutional power, and in excess of statutory authority in \n3  violation of the APA. \n4  168.  In issuing and implementing the Edlow Memorandum when Defendant Edlow was \n5  improperly designated to the position of Deputy Director of Policy at USCIS by Defendant Wolf, \n6  who lacked any legal authority to designate Defendant Edlow to that position, Defendants have \n7  acted not in accordance with law, contrary to constitutional power, and in excess of statutory \n8  authority in violation of the APA.  \n9  169.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and their residents, \n10  who are within the zone of interests of the relevant statutes and/or constitutional provisions. \n11  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n12  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706 \n13  ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n14  170.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n15  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n16  171.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is \n17  “arbitrary,” “capricious,” or an “abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n18  172.  In issuing and implementing the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda, Defendants have \n19  acted arbitrarily and capriciously and abused their discretion in violation of the APA. Defendants \n20  have not offered a reasoned basis for these actions and failed to consider important aspects of the \n21  problem, including, but not limited to, the reliance interests of third parties, including the Plaintiff \n22  States. \n23  173.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiff States and their residents, \n24  who are within the zone of interests of the relevant statutes and/or constitutional provisions. \n25  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n26  Violation of Federal Vacancies Reform Act—5 U.S.C. §§ 3345-3349c \n27  174.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n28  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n \n  44   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 46 of 50\n \n1  175.  The office of Secretary of Homeland Security is an office to which the FVRA \n2  applies. 5 U.S.C. § 3345. The FVRA provides that “the person serving as an acting officer as \n3  described under section 3345 may serve in the office for no longer than 210 days beginning on \n4  the date the vacancy occurs.” 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1). Once the time periods in the statute have \n5  elapsed, “the office shall remain vacant” and “an action taken by any person who is not acting” \n6  pursuant to the FVRA “in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant office” to which \n7  the FVRA applies “shall have no force or effect” and “may not be ratified.” 5 U.S.C.  \n8  § 3348(b)(1), (d)(1)-(2). \n9  176.  Defendant Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum in the performance of a function or \n10  duty of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n11  177.  Defendant Wolf designated Defendant Edlow to the position of Deputy Director of \n12  Policy at USCIS in the performance of a function or duty of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n13  178.  Because, on the date that the order of succession for Secretary of Homeland \n14  Security was purportedly amended by Commissioner McAleenan, more than 210 days had passed \n15  since the office of Secretary of Homeland Security had become vacant and no nomination for \n16  such office had been submitted to the Senate, Commissioner McAleenan was performing the \n17  functions or duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security in violation of the Federal Vacancies \n18  Reform Act, and his purported amendment to the order of succession had no force or effect and \n19  may not be ratified. \n20  179.  Because, on the date that the Wolf Memorandum was issued, more than 210 days \n21  had passed since the office of Secretary of Homeland Security had become vacant and no \n22  nomination for such office had been submitted to the Senate, Defendant Wolf was performing the \n23  functions or duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security in violation of the Federal Vacancies \n24  Reform Act, and the Wolf Memorandum has no force or effect and may not be ratified.  \n25  180.  Because, on the date that Defendant Edlow was designated as Deputy Director of \n26  Policy at USCIS, more than 210 days had passed since the office of Secretary of Homeland \n27  Security had become vacant and no nomination for such office had been submitted to the Senate, \n28  Defendant Wolf was performing the functions or duties of the Secretary of Homeland Security in \n \n  45   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 47 of 50\n \n1  violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and the designation of Defendant Edlow has no \n2  force or effect and may not be ratified. \n3  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n4  Violation of Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. §§ 112-113 \n5  181.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n6  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n7  182.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may be appointed only with the advice and \n8  consent of the Senate. 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1). \n9  183.  In the event of a vacancy in the office of Secretary of Homeland Security, the \n10  order of succession is governed by 6 U.S.C. § 113(g) and by the order of succession designated \n11  by the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n12  184.  Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to perform the functions and duties of \n13  Secretary of Homeland Security or to hold the position of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n14  pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 113(g) and the relevant, valid order of succession in effect on the date that \n15  Defendant Wolf purported to assume the position of Acting Secretary. \n16  185.  Because Defendant Wolf is performing the functions and duties of the Secretary of \n17  Homeland Security without having been confirmed in that position by the Senate, and without \n18  statutory authorization pursuant to the HSA or any other legal authority, his actions, including his \n19  purported issuance of the Wolf Memorandum and purported designation of Defendant Edlow as \n20  Deputy Director for Policy of USCIS, are invalid and void.  \n21  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n22  Violation of the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2 \n23  186.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n24  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n25  187.  The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that principal officers \n26  of the United States be appointed by the President “by and with the advice and consent of the \n27  Senate.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  \n28 \n \n  46   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 48 of 50\n \n1  188.  The Department of Homeland Security is an Executive Department, 5 U.S.C. § \n2  101, and the Secretary of Homeland Security is a principal subject to the Appointments Clause. \n3  189.  Defendant Wolf has not been confirmed by the Senate to the position of Secretary \n4  of Homeland Security. \n5  190.  Because (1) the office of Secretary of Homeland Security has been vacant for a \n6  lengthy and unreasonable period of time, and (2) Commissioner McAleenan, as an inferior \n7  officer, lacked authority under the Appointments Clause to appoint an inferior officer, and (3) \n8  Defendant Wolf has been unlawfully performing the functions and duties of the Secretary of \n9  Homeland Security in an acting capacity, Defendant Wolf is serving in the position of Acting \n10  Secretary in violation of the Appointments Clause, and his issuance of the Wolf Memorandum is \n11  unlawful. \n12  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n13  Ultra Vires \n14  191.  Plaintiff States re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n15  each of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n16  192.  Neither a federal official nor an agency can take any action that exceeds the scope \n17  of their constitutional and/or statutory authority.  \n18  193.  Defendants Wolf and Edlow have acted ultra vires in promulgating the Wolf and \n19  Edlow Memoranda without legal authority.  \n20  194.  For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that \n21  Defendants’ promulgation of the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda are unlawful, and the Court should \n22  enjoin Defendants’ implementation of those actions. \n23  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n24  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff States respectfully request that this Court enter judgment in their \n25  favor, and grant the following relief: \n26  1.  Declare that Defendants’ actions in promulgating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda \n27  are arbitrary, capricious, abuses of discretion, contrary to constitutional power, in excess of \n28 \n \n  47   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 49 of 50\n \n1  statutory authority, and otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the Administrative \n2  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-706; \n3  2.  Declare that Defendants’ actions in promulgating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda \n4  are ultra vires; \n5  3.  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n6  violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345-3349c; \n7  4.  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s actions taken as Acting Secretary of Homeland \n8  Security and/or in the performance of the functions or duties of the Secretary of Homeland \n9  Security, including his purported change to DACA policy and procedure, have no force and effect \n10  and may not be ratified pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d); \n11  5.  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n12  violates the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2); \n13  6.  Enjoin Defendants from altering and limiting DACA or engaging in any action to \n14  frustrate its full and continued implementation without complying with the APA and other \n15  relevant laws; \n16  7.  Vacate and set aside the Wolf and the Edlow Memoranda; and \n17  8.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  48   \nFirst Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 124   Filed 11/02/20   Page 50 of 50\n \n1  Dated: November 2, 2020  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \n2  XAVIER BECERRA \nAttorney General of California \n3  MICHAEL L.

For the reasons below, dismissal is DENIED and some provisional relief\n23\nis GRANTED. \n24\nSTATEMENT\n25\nIn 2012, the United States Department of Homeland Security adopted a program to\n26\npostpone deportation of undocumented immigrants brought to America as children and, pending\n27\naction in their cases, to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security\n28\nnumbers, pay taxes, and become part of the mainstream economy.  This program received the\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 2 of 49\n1 title “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” — DACA for short.  In 2017, however, after the\n2 national election and change in administrations, the agency eventually reversed itself and began\n3 a phase-out of DACA.  All agree that a new administration is entitled to replace old policies\n4 with new policies so long as they comply with the law.  One question presented in these related\n5 actions is whether the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather\n6 than in compliance with the law.\n7 1. HISTORY OF DEFERRED ACTION.\n8 At the core of these cases is an administrative practice known as “deferred action.” \n9 A primary question presented concerns the extent to which the Department of Homeland\n10 Security could lawfully use deferred action to implement DACA, and so it is important to review\nt 11 the history of deferred action as well as of other features of the DACA program.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Congress has the constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant thereto, Congress has established a comprehensive scheme governing\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 immigration and naturalization through the Immigration and Nationality Act.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 et seq.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is “charged with the administration and enforcement\nS N 16 of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” \nted  For the  17 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  The Secretary is further charged with “establishing national immigration\ni\nn\nU\n18 enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).   \n19 One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., deportation.  In turn,\n20 “[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration\n21 officials.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).  As an initial matter, in any given\n22 case, immigration officials “must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Ibid. \n23 At each stage of the removal process, they have “discretion to abandon the endeavor.”  Reno v.\n24 Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”).  \n25 Beginning as early as 1975, one way to exercise this discretion became “deferred action.” \n26 By deferred action, immigration officials could postpone, seemingly indefinitely, the removal of\n27 individuals unlawfully present in the United States “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the\n28\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 3 of 49\n1 Executive’s] own convenience.”  Id. at 483–84.  Immigration officials could also grant parole,\n2 temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure.  \n3 Some of these discretionary powers have flowed from statute.  Parole, for example,\n4 has allowed otherwise inadmissible aliens to temporarily enter the United States “for urgent\n5 humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Temporary\n6 protected status, also created by statute, has been available to nationals of designated foreign\n7 states affected by armed conflicts, environmental disasters, and other extraordinary conditions. \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  \n9 Some of these discretionary powers, however, have flowed from nonstatutory powers. \n10 Deferred enforced departure had no statutory basis but, instead, grew out of “the President’s\nt 11 constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations.”  USCIS, Adjudicator’s Field Manual\nr\nu\no a 12 § 38.2(a) (2014).  Nor has extended voluntary departure been anchored in any statute.  Rather,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 it has been recognized as part of the discretion of the Attorney General.  Hotel & Restaurant\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Employees Union, Local 25 v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc).  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Deferred action, originally known as “nonpriority” status, also began “without express\nS N 16 statutory authorization” but has since been recognized by the Supreme Court as a “regular\nted  For the  17 practice.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action by explicit\ni\nn\nU\n18 reference to it in the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2)):\n19 The denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under\nthis subsection shall not preclude the alien from applying for a stay\n20 of removal, deferred action, or a continuance or abeyance of\nremoval proceedings under any other provision of the immigration\n21 laws of the United States.\n22 Another federal statute, the REAL ID Act, also acknowledged deferred action.  REAL ID\n23 Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231.

Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053,\n3 1062 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Brewer I”); see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (defining an “unauthorized alien”\n4 not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident\n5 nor “authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security]”). \n6 Pursuant to this statutory authority, regulations promulgated in the 1980s allowed recipients of\n7 deferred action to apply for work authorization if they could demonstrate an “economic necessity\n8 for employment.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  \n9 The George W. Bush Administration began to use deferred action to mitigate a harsh\n10 statutory provision involving “unlawful presence.”  The Illegal Immigration Reform and\nt 11 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 created three- and ten-year bars on the admission of\nr\nu\no a 12 aliens who departed or were removed from the United States after periods of “unlawful\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 presence” of between 180 days and one year, or more than one year, respectively.  8 U.S.C.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).  It also imposed a permanent bar on the admission of any alien who,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 without being admitted, entered or attempted to reenter the United States after having been\nS N 16 unlawfully present for an aggregate period of more than one year.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). \nted  For the  17 Beginning in 2007, however, DHS regulations and policy guidance provided that deferred action\ni\nn\nU\n18 recipients did not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry. \n19 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2); Memorandum for Field Leadership,\n20 from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic Operations Directorate, USCIS,\n21 Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence for Purposes of Sections\n22 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009).  DHS excluded recipients\n23 of deferred action from being “unlawfully present” because their deferred action is a period of\n24 stay authorized by the government.  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059 (citing 8 U.S.C.\n25 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii)).  This nonaccrual practice arose well before DACA.1  \n26\n27\n1  Undocumented aliens do not begin to accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of\n28\nSection 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) until they reach the age of eighteen.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii).\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 5 of 49\n1 DACA grew out of a long agency history of discretionary relief programs.  In 1956, the\n2 Eisenhower Administration paroled roughly one thousand foreign-born orphans who had been\n3 adopted by American citizens but were precluded from entering the United States because of\n4 statutory quotas.  That same administration later granted parole to tens of thousands of\n5 Hungarian refugees after the unsuccessful Hungarian revolution.  Both programs flowed from\n6 presidential statements, and the programs later ended (in 1959 and 1958, respectively) when\n7 Congress passed laws enabling the paroled individuals to become lawful permanent residents\n8 (App. 1602–03, 1948–57; AR 33).2 \n9 In 1987, President Ronald Reagan instituted the Family Fairness Program, a non-\n10 statutory program that provided extended voluntary departure to children whose parents were in\nt 11 the process of legalizing their immigration status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nr\nu\no a 12 of 1986.  President George H.W. Bush extended the non-statutory program in 1990 to cover\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 spouses of such legalized aliens, and the program ultimately provided immigration relief to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 approximately 1.5 million people.  The need for the program ended with the passage of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration Act of 1990 (App. 1607, 1612–13, 1703).\nS N 16 On at least four occasions prior to the creation of DACA, immigration officials have\nted  For the  17 extended deferred action programs to certain classes of aliens, none of which programs was\ni\nn\nU\n18 expressly authorized by statute:  \n19 • In 1997, INS established a deferred action program for individuals\n20 self-petitioning for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of\n21 1994.  This program is still in place today.  As originally enacted, the\n22 Act did not mention deferred action, but instead provided a pathway\n23 to lawful permanent residency.  Deferred action allowed applicants\n24 to remain in the country pending a decision on their applications. \n25\n26\n2  “App.” refers to the appendix submitted in support of plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief (Dkt.\nNos. 113, 117–19, 121, 124).  In connection with their motion for provisional relief, plaintiffs seek judicial\n27\nnotice of thirty-nine exhibits submitted with the appendix (Dkt. No. 111-2).  The request is unopposed. \nThese exhibits consist of congressional testimony and government publications, memoranda, and press releases. \n28\nPlaintiffs’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED. \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 6 of 49\n1 Congress later expanded the deferred action program in the 2000\n2 VAWA reauthorization legislation (App. at 1640–46).\n3 • In 2002 and 2003, INS issued memoranda instructing officers to make\n4 deferred action assessments for T visa applicants (victims of human\n5 trafficking) and U visa applicants (victims of crimes such as domestic\n6 violence) (App. 1650–58).  These programs have since been codified in\n7 regulations promulgated by INS and DHS. 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(k)(1),\n8 (k)(4), (m)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2).\n9 • After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USCIS announced a deferred action\n10 program for certain foreign students (F-1 visa holders) who, because of\nt 11 the hurricane, could not satisfy the requirements of their student visas. \nr\nu\no a 12 In announcing the program, USCIS stated that “[t]he interim relief\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 [would] remain in effect until February 1, 2006” (App. 1661–62).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • In 2009, to fill a gap under the law, USCIS established a deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action program for widowed spouses who had been married to United\nS N 16 States citizens for less than two years.  Congress later eliminated the\nted  For the  17 statutory requirement that an alien be married to a United States citizen\ni\nn\nU\n18 for at least two years at the time of the citizen’s death to retain\n19 eligibility for lawful immigration status, and USCIS accordingly\n20 withdrew the deferred action program as “obsolete” (App. 1664–82). \n21 In sum, by the time DACA arrived in 2012, deferred action programs had become a\n22 well-accepted feature of the executive’s enforcement of our immigration laws, recognized as\n23 such by Congress and the Supreme Court. \n24 2. DACA.\n25 On June 15, 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a\n26 memorandum establishing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  Under DACA, immigrants\n27 brought to the United States as children could apply for deferred action for a two-year period,\n28 subject to renewal.  To qualify for DACA, an individual must:  (1) have come to the United\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 7 of 49\n1 States before the age of sixteen and been under the age of thirty-one on June 15, 2012;\n2 (2) have been present in the United States on June 15, 2012; (3) have been continuously residing\n3 in the United States for at least the prior five years; (4) have been enrolled in school, graduated\n4 from high school, obtained a GED, or been honorably discharged from the United States military\n5 or Coast Guard; and (5) not pose a threat to national security or public safety (AR 1).\n6 The 2012 DACA memo described the program as an exercise of “prosecutorial\n7 discretion.”  Secretary Napolitano found leniency “especially justified” for the DACA-eligible,\n8 whom she described as “productive young people” who “have already contributed to our country\n9 in significant ways.”  The memo further stated that these individuals “lacked the intent to violate\n10 the law” and were low priority cases for deportation (AR 1–2).\nt 11 DACA applicants had to pass a DHS background check and applications had to be\nr\nu\no a 12 “decided on a case by case basis.”  To apply for DACA, eligible individuals completed USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Form I-821D.  The application called for substantial personal information, such as biographical\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 information, date of entry into the United States, immigration status or lack thereof, educational\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 history, and all prior residential addresses since entering the United States.\nS N 16   Form I-821D also required substantial documentary support, including proof of identity\nted  For the  17 and proof of continuous residence in the United States through rent receipts, utility bills,\ni\nn\nU\n18 employment documents, or similar records.  Applicants also appeared at a USCIS field office\n19 to provide fingerprints, photographs, and signatures.  The form’s instructions stated (App. 1820):\n20 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nto ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the\n21 purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the\nrequestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear\n22 or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to\nAppear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be\n23 shared with national security and law enforcement agencies,\nincluding ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\n24 including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for\nchildhood arrivals request itself, to identify or prevent fraudulent\n25 claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or\nprosecution of a criminal offense.  The above information sharing\n26 clause covers family members and guardians, in addition to the\nrequestor.  \n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 8 of 49\n1 The form’s instructions also stated (App. 1808):\n2 Individuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into\nremoval proceedings or removed from the United States for a\n3 specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.\n4\nDACA applicants also submitted a Form I-765, Application for Employment\n5\nAuthorization, a Form I-765WS, Worksheet, and the accompanying fees.  To determine an\n6\napplicant’s eligibility for work authorization, USCIS reviewed the applicant’s current annual\n7\nincome, current annual expenses, and the total current value of his or her assets (App. 1762,\n8\n1801–21, 2067–87). \n9\nIf approved, the recipient received a Form I-797, Notice of Action, stating (App. 585):\n10\nUSCIS, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, has decided\nt 11 to defer action in your case.  Deferred action is an exercise of\nr\nu prosecutorial discretion by USCIS not to pursue the removal of an\no a 12 individual from the United States for a specific period.  Deferred\nC ni\n  or action does not confer or alter any immigration status.  \nct alif 13  \ni C\ntr of  Significantly, DHS could terminate a recipient’s deferred action at any time, at the\n Dis District  14 agency’s discretion, and DACA paved no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\ntates orthern  15 citizenship (App. 1774, 1808).  Secretary Napolitano concluded her DACA memorandum\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 (AR 1–3):\ni\nn This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status\nU\n18 or pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through its\nlegislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for the\n19 executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of\ndiscretion within the framework of the existing law.  I have done\n20 so here.\n21 But DACA did provide important benefits.  First, under pre-existing regulations, DACA\n22 recipients became eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action,\n23 thereby allowing them to obtain social security numbers and to become legitimate taxpayers and\n24 contributing members of our open economy.  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Second, deferred action\n25 provided a measure of safety for a period of two years from detention and removal, albeit always\n26 subject to termination at any time in any individual case.  Third, DACA recipients could apply\n27 for “advance parole” to obtain permission to travel overseas and be paroled back into the United\n28 States.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f).  Fourth, also pursuant to pre-existing regulations, DACA recipients\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 9 of 49\n1 avoided accrual of time for “unlawful presence” under the INA’s bar on re-entry.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1182(a)(9)(B)–(C) (establishing three-year, ten-year, and permanent bars on the admission\n3 of aliens after specified periods of “unlawful presence”). \n4 USCIS “strongly encourage[d]” DACA recipients to submit renewal requests between\n5 120 and 150 days before the expiration date-stamped on the recipient’s Form I-797.  According\n6 to the “Frequently Asked Questions” posted on the agency’s website, recipients were eligible for\n7 renewal under DACA so long as they:  (1) did not depart the United States on or after August 15,\n8 2012, without advance parole; (2) continuously resided in the United States since submitting\n9 their most recent DACA request; and (3) had not received criminal convictions (with minor\n10 exceptions).  Renewal requests did not require additional documentary support (App. 1756–57).\nt 11 The agency adopted DACA without any notice or opportunity for public comment.\nr\nu\no a 12 According to data published by USCIS, 793,026 applicants received deferred action\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 under DACA since its inception.  As of September 2017, there remained approximately 689,800\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 active DACA recipients.  Their average age was 23.8.  Based on a survey completed by\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Associate Professor Tom K. Wong in August 2017, 91 percent of DACA recipients had jobs,\nS N 16 and 45 percent of DACA recipients were enrolled in school (App. 1494–1522, 1533–52).  \nted  For the  17 3. THE DAPA LITIGATION.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 In 2014, DHS announced a different deferred action program for parents of United States\n19 citizens or lawful permanent residents, titled “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\n20 Lawful Permanent Residents” — shortened to the confusingly-similar acronym DAPA.  \n21 For our purposes, DAPA is important because the United States Court of Appeals for\n22 the Fifth Circuit promptly held that DAPA exceeded the statutory authority of DHS, a holding\n23 that eventually moved Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rule that DACA too had exceeded the\n24 agency’s authority.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). \n25 The 2014 DAPA memo directed USCIS “to establish a process, similar to DACA, for\n26 exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,”\n27 for aliens who had a son or daughter who was a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n28 resident and:  (1) were not an enforcement priority under DHS policy; (2) had continuously\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 10 of 49\n1 resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) had been physically present in the\n2 United States both when DHS announced DAPA and at the time of application to the program;\n3 and (4) presented “no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, [made] the grant of\n4 deferred action inappropriate” (AR 37–41).  \n5 That same 2014 announcement also expanded DACA in three minor ways:  (1) allowing\n6 otherwise eligible immigrants to apply for DACA even if they were older than 31 on the day\n7 DACA was earlier announced; (2) extending DACA renewals and work authorizations from\n8 two- to three-year periods; and (3) adjusting DACA’s date-of-entry requirement from June 15,\n9 2007, to January 1, 2010 (AR 37–41).  \n10 DAPA was also adopted without notice or opportunity for public comment. \nt 11 A coalition of twenty-six states immediately filed suit in the United States District Court\nr\nu\no a 12 for the Southern District of Texas to challenge DAPA.  The district court preliminarily enjoined\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 its implementation on the ground that DHS had failed to comply with the APA’s\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 notice-and-comment requirements.  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The district court’s order stated that “with three minor exceptions,” the case did not involve\nS N 16 DACA (id. at 606):\nted  For the  17 The Complaint in this matter does not include the actions taken by\ni\nn Secretary Napolitano, which have to date formalized the status of\nU\n18 approximately 700,000 teenagers and young adults.  Therefore,\nthose actions are not before the Court and will not be addressed\n19 by this opinion.  Having said that, DACA will necessarily be\ndiscussed in this opinion as it is relevant to many legal issues in\n20 the present case.  For example, the States maintain that the DAPA\napplications will undergo a process identical to that used for\n21 DACA applications and, therefore, DACA’s policies and\nprocedures will be instructive for the Court as to DAPA’s\n22 implementation.\n23 In holding that DAPA violated notice-and-comment procedures, the district court held\n24 that it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the status and employability of\n25 millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal government.”  It therefore should\n26 have been issued, the district court held, after notice and opportunity for public comment.  Id. at\n27 671.  Though the order focused on DAPA, it also preliminarily enjoined everything in the 2014\n28\n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 11 of 49\n1 memorandum, including the three minor ways in which DACA had been modified (but left alone\n2 the 2012 DACA program).  \n3 The Fifth Circuit affirmed in a split decision but added a further ground for affirmance. \n4 Texas, 809 F.3d at 178.  Over a dissent, the appellate panel added the ground that DAPA was\n5 substantively foreclosed by statute because the INA contained “an intricate process for illegal\n6 aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children’s immigration status,”\n7 and that DAPA, by providing “the benefits of lawful presence” to undocumented immigrants\n8 “solely on account of their children’s immigration status,” was inconsistent with this statutory\n9 scheme, which provided its own pathway for lawful presence to parents of children lawfully\n10 in the United States.  Id. at 179–80, 186.  The Fifth Circuit’s holding was also based on its\nt 11 observation that “the INA does not grant the Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and\nr\nu\no a 12 lawful presence on a class-wide basis to 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens.”  Id. at 186\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 n.202.  The decision was later affirmed without opinion by an equally divided Supreme Court. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam).3 \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In February 2017, DHS Secretary John Kelly issued guidance regarding the Trump\nS N 16 Administration’s immigration enforcement priorities.  Although the guidance rescinded “all\nted  For the  17 existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our\ni\nn\nU\n18 immigration laws and priorities for removal,” the 2012 DACA memo and 2014 DAPA memo\n19 were explicitly left in place.  The guidance also said that the 2014 DAPA memo would “be\n20 addressed in future guidance” (AR 229–34).  \n21 In June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded the 2014 DAPA memo, which rescission\n22 included the 2014 expansions of DACA.  He explained: \n23 I have considered a number of factors, including the preliminary\ninjunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA\n24 never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities. \nAfter consulting with the Attorney General, and in the exercise of\n25 my discretion in establishing national immigration enforcement\npolicies and priorities, I hereby rescind the November 20, 2014,\n26 memorandum. \n27\n28\n3  Such an affirmance has no precedential value.  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 192 (1972).  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 12 of 49\n1 Again, however, Secretary Kelly declared that the 2012 DACA memo would remain in effect\n2 (AR 235–37).  \n3 4. RESCISSION OF DACA.    \n4 Also in June 2017, ten of the twenty-six plaintiffs from the DAPA litigation wrote to\n5 Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand rescission of the 2012 DACA memo.  Their letter\n6 stated that if DACA was rescinded by September 5, they would dismiss the still-pending DAPA\n7 litigation.  Otherwise, the letter threatened to try to amend their complaint to additionally\n8 challenge the legality of DACA (AR 238–40).  \n9 A day before the deadline, the Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland\n10 Security Elaine Duke via a short letter that the Obama Administration had created DACA\nt 11 “without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated\nr\nu\no a 12 rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” and that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 therefore the program was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 The Attorney General’s letter also referenced the preliminary injunction against DAPA, then\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 stated that “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the\nS N 16 courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar\nted  For the  17 results with respect to DACA” (AR 251).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 The following day, without prior notice, the Acting Secretary rescinded DACA. \n19 The rescission was not based on any policy criticism.  Instead, it was based on the legal\n20 determination by the Attorney General.  The Acting Secretary explained that after “[t]aking into\n21 consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and\n22 the September 4, 2017, letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012,\n23 DACA program should be terminated.”  She said that “[r]ecognizing the complexities associated\n24 with winding down the program,” DHS would “provide a limited window” in which it would\n25 adjudicate certain requests, but that new DACA requests and applications for employment\n26 authorization would be rejected starting immediately.  DHS would adjudicate, on a case-by-case\n27 basis, DACA renewal requests received within thirty days from beneficiaries whose DACA\n28 status would expire before March 5, 2018.  She also instructed DHS to immediately stop\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 13 of 49\n1 approving new applications for advance parole.  The rescission left in place all extant grants of\n2 deferred action and work authorizations for the remainder of their validity periods (AR 252–56). \n3 Consequently, starting in March 2018, the DACA population will, over two years, dwindle down\n4 to zero. \n5 On the night of the rescission, President Trump called upon Congress specifically to\n6 enact DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n7 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!”  During an interview\n8 earlier in 2017, President Trump had stated “we are not after the dreamers, we are after the\n9 criminals” and that “the dreamers should rest easy” (App. 1852–53, 1958). \n10 In sum, the new administration didn’t terminate DACA on policy grounds.  It terminated\nt 11 DACA over a point of law, a pithy conclusion that the agency had exceeded its statutory and\nr\nu\no a 12 constitutional authority.  An important question now presented is whether that conclusion was a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 mistake of law.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 5.

UC Plaintiffs allege they have invested\n19 considerable resources in recruiting students and staff who are DACA recipients, and that these\n20 individuals make important contributions to the University.  As DACA recipients lose their work\n21 authorizations, UC Plaintiffs allege that the University will lose significant intellectual capital\n22 and productivity.  They further allege that students who lose DACA protections will be unable\n23 “to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships and certain financial aid and\n24 scholarships, study abroad, or work to pay their tuition and other expenses,” and as a result may\n25 withdraw from the University altogether (UC Compl. ¶¶ 4–6, 34–37, 48–49).4 \n26\n27\n4  Two additional DACA lawsuits proceed in the Eastern District of New York before Judge Nicholas\nGaraufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case No. 16-cv-04756\n28\nNGG.\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 14 of 49\n1 On September 11, the States of California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota filed suit. \n2 Plaintiff States allege that they are home to more than 238,000 DACA recipients, and that the\n3 loss of their residents’ DACA status and work authorizations will injure their public colleges\n4 and universities, upset the States’ workforces, disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory\n5 interests, cause harm to hundreds of thousands of their residents, damage their economies,\n6 and hurt companies based in Plaintiff States (States Compl. ¶¶ 1–10).  \n7 The City of San Jose, on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees who are DACA\n8 recipients, filed its action on September 14.  San Jose alleges that it has hired DACA recipients\n9 into vital City jobs, that substantial resources were invested in training these employees, and that\n10 the City will be harmed when these employees are forced to leave the workforce (when they lose\nt 11 their work authorizations).  San Jose further alleges that it will continue to lose tax revenue as\nr\nu\no a 12 DACA recipients lose work authorizations and can no longer contribute to the City’s tax base\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 (San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 10, 28, 49–51). \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 On September 18, Individual DACA recipients Dulce Garcia, Miriam Gonzalez Avila,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Saul Jimenez Suarez, Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza, Norma Ramirez, and Jirayut\nS N 16 Latthivongskorn brought suit to challenge the termination of DACA.  Individual Plaintiffs work\nted  For the  17 and study in the fields of law, medicine, education, and psychology.  They allege that the loss of\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA will frustrate their professional goals and accomplishments.  They further allege that as a\n19 result of the rescission, they will lose access to numerous federal and state benefits, and may not\n20 be able to reside in the United States with their families.  They applied for DACA in reliance on\n21 the government’s representations that information provided under the program would not be\n22 used for purposes of immigration enforcement (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 4–9, 55, 59, 72, 78, 85, 95,\n23 128). \n24 Finally, the County of Santa Clara and the Service Employees International Union Local\n25 521 filed their complaint on October 10.  The County alleges that it employs DACA recipients,\n26 including union members, in key positions, such as in its In-Home Supportive Services Program\n27 and New Americans Fellowship Program.  The County alleges that it has expended time and\n28 money in training these employees, and that it relies on them to provide important services. \n14\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 15 of 49\n1 As DACA recipients leave the workforce, the County will lose important employees, will incur\n2 harm to its economy and suffer decreased tax revenue, and will incur the costs of increased\n3 dependency on subsidized health care and other County services.  Local 521 sues as an\n4 associational plaintiff on behalf of its members who are DACA recipients, and alleges that the\n5 Union’s organizational mission is to organize, represent, and empower employees, as well as\n6 mobilize immigration reform (Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 1, 15–20, 32, 37, 43–52). \n7 Collectively, plaintiffs assert the following claims: \n8 • The rescission violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it\n9 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in\n10 accordance with law (UC Compl. ¶¶ 50–58; State Compl. ¶¶ 152–55;\nt 11 Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 165–84; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 67–73).\nr\nu\no a 12 • The rescission violated the APA because it was a substantive rule that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 did not comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements or\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Regulatory Flexibility Act’s mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 604 that\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 an agency publish analysis of a rule’s impact on small businesses\nS N 16 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 59–66; State Compl. ¶¶ 146–63; San Jose Compl.\nted  For the  17 ¶¶ 59–63; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 177–84).\ni\nn\nU\n18 • The rescission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally-protected\n19 property and liberty interests without due process of law.  Plaintiffs also\n20 allege that the rescission violated due process because the government\n21 changed its policy regarding agency use of DACA-related information\n22 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 67–73; State Compl. ¶¶ 141–45; Garcia Compl.\n23 ¶¶ 133–47; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 59–66).\n24 • The rescission violates equal protection of the law because it was\n25 motivated by discriminatory animus and because it deprived DACA\n26 grantees of their substantial interests in supporting themselves and\n27 furthering their education (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77; San Jose Compl.\n28 ¶¶ 52–58; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 148–59; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 74–78).\n15\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 16 of 49\n1 • The rescission violates equitable estoppel.  DACA recipients provided\n2 detailed personal information to the government and rearranged their\n3 lives based on the government’s representations, but now face the\n4 possibility of removal.  Plaintiffs argue that the government should\n5 therefore be equitably estopped from terminating DACA or from using\n6 their DACA information for immigration enforcement purposes (State\n7 Compl. ¶¶ 164–71; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 192–99; Santa Clara Compl.\n8 ¶¶ 79–86).\n9 • Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the rescission was unlawful and an\n10 order restoring DACA (UC Compl. at 16, State Compl. at 35–36;\nt 11 San Jose Compl. at 15–16; Garcia Compl. at 43; Santa Clara Compl.\nr\nu\no a 12 at 26–27). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 On September 21, an initial case management conference occurred for all DACA actions\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 in our district.  At the conference, all counsel, including government counsel, presented a joint\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 proposal whereby the government would file the administrative record by October 13. \nS N 16 Significantly, although the government argued that discovery would be premature, it agreed to\nted  For the  17 submit the administrative record without any condition that it be done before any decision on its\ni\nn\nU\n18 threshold jurisdictional motion (presumably because it knew its jurisdictional motion would be\n19 premised on the administrative record) (see Dkt. No. 114 at 16; Tr. at 17:3, 22:2).  The Court\n20 made only slight revisions to the joint proposal, all in aid of a stated goal of providing a full\n21 record and final decision for our court of appeals prior to the March 5 expiration date.  Pursuant\n22 to FRCP 26, a case management order then set a October 6 deadline for the government to file\n23 the administrative record, set a briefing schedule for the parties’ motions to dismiss, for\n24 provisional relief, or for summary judgment, and permitted the parties to proceed with\n25 reasonable, limited, and narrowly-directed discovery (Dkt. No. 49).\n26 The government filed an administrative record on October 6.  It was merely, however,\n27 fourteen documents comprising 256 pages of which 187 consisted of published opinions from\n28 the DAPA litigation, and all of which already resided in the public domain.  All non-public\n16\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 17 of 49\n1 materials, some eighty-four documents, actually reviewed by the Acting Secretary remained\n2 withheld as privileged (Dkt. No. 71).  In other words, of the ninety-eight DACA-related\n3 documents personally considered by the decisionmaker, all but the fourteen already known to\n4 the public were withheld as privileged.  Although government counsel further indicated, upon\n5 inquiry by the district judge, that the decisionmaker had also likely received verbal input,\n6 nothing was included in the administrative record to capture this input.  Nor were there any\n7 materials regarding the agency’s earlier, recent decisions to leave DACA in place.  \n8 On October 9, plaintiffs moved to require the government to complete the administrative\n9 record, seeking all materials considered directly or indirectly by the Acting Secretary in\n10 reaching her decision to rescind DACA, which motion was granted in part and denied in part. \nt 11 The government, having earlier consented to filing the administrative record, was ordered to\nr\nu\no a 12 keep its word and to file a complete administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 65, 79–80).\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Instead, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus with our court of appeals,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 seeking relief from having to complete the administrative record until after its jurisdictional\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 arguments were determined, a turnabout from its earlier voluntary proposal and stipulation to\nS N 16 file the administrative record as part of an agreed-upon schedule.  After full briefing and oral\nted  For the  17 argument, our court of appeals denied the government’s mandamus petition and vacated the\ni\nn\nU\n18 stay (over one dissent).5  \n19 The government was again ordered to complete the administrative record, this time by\n20 November 22, later extended to December 22 to accommodate the government’s claim of\n21 burden.  On December 1, however, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus and\n22 application for a stay in the United States Supreme Court.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court did\n23 not reach the merits of the government’s petition but required that defendants’ jurisdictional\n24 defenses be adjudicated prior to consideration of discovery or completing the administrative\n25\n5  Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the government’s petition\n26\nfor a writ of mandamus to stay an order to supplement the same administrative record.  The court of appeals\nfound that there was “a strong suggestion that the record before the District Court was not complete” and, noting\n27\nthat nearly 200 pages of the record consisted of published opinions from various federal courts, “[i]t is difficult\nto imagine that a decision as important as whether to repeal DACA would be made based upon a factual record\n28\nof little more than 56 pages, even accepting that litigation risk was the reason for repeal.”  In Re: Kirstjen M.\nNielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d. Cir. Dec. 27, 2017).\n17\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 18 of 49\n1 record (Dkt. Nos. 86, 188, 197, 214, 224), a decision the district judge himself might have made\n2 at the outset save for the government’s own proposal and agreement to file the administrative\n3 record in October. \n4 Consequently, this action has proceeded on the incomplete administrative record\n5 initially filed by the government.  Plaintiffs have been forced to draw on other materials. \n6 Ironically, even the government in these motions relies on material outside of the administrative\n7 record to defend the agency decision (Dkt. No. 204 at 10, 12, 19–20).  The parties have now\n8 fully briefed motions to dismiss and a motion for provisional relief, all argued on December 20\n9 (Dkt. Nos. 111, 114).  This order now follows.\n10 ANALYSIS\nt 11 1. MOTION TO DISMISS.\nr\nu\no a 12 Defendants raise three jurisdictional arguments under FRCP 12(b)(1).  First, they argue\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 that the decision to rescind DACA was a discretionary act barred from judicial review under\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the APA.  Second, they contend that the INA bars judicial review.  Third, although defendants\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 concede that Individual Plaintiffs have standing, they contend that no others do.  Each is\nS N 16 now addressed in turn.  A separate order will consider defendants’ motion to dismiss under\nted  For the  17 FRCP 12(b)(6).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. The DACA Rescission Was Not Committed \nTo Agency Discretion by Law.\n19\nCongress has instructed our district courts to review and set aside agency action found\n20\nto be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n21\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Under the APA, however, our district courts lack subject-matter\n22\njurisdiction to review agency action that is “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C.\n23\n§ 701(a)(2).  \n24\nIn Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), the\n25\nSupreme Court explained that the jurisdictional bar of Section 701(a)(2) is “very narrow” and\n26\n“applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given\n27\ncase there is no law to apply.”  The Supreme Court held that because the statute there at issue\n28\ncontained “clear and specific directives” guiding the agency’s decision, there was “‘law to\n18\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 19 of 49\n1 apply,’ so the exemption for action ‘committed to agency discretion’ [was] inapplicable.”  Id. at\n2 411–13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n3 When it next revisited the exception in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985),\n4 the Supreme Court reiterated that the exception applies only where “the statute is drawn so\n5 that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise\n6 of discretion.”  There, condemned inmates asked the FDA to bring an enforcement action to\n7 prevent purported violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through the\n8 administration of death-penalty drugs.  The FDA Commissioner, however, refused to do so on\n9 the ground that the FDA lacked jurisdiction and otherwise should not interfere with the state\n10 criminal justice system.  Skipping over the agency jurisdiction issue, the Supreme Court held\nt 11 that such decisions not to prosecute or initiate enforcement actions are generally not reviewable\nr\nu\no a 12 as they are “committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id. at 824–25, 831. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Chaney identified several characteristics of non-enforcement decisions as key to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 its holding.  First, non-enforcement decisions require a complicated balancing of factors\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 “peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including whether “resources are best spent on\nS N 16 this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular\nted  For the  17 enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies, and . . . whether the agency\ni\nn\nU\n18 has enough resources to undertake the action at all.”  Id. at 831.  Second, in refusing to act,\n19 an agency “does not exercise its coercive power over an individual’s liberty” and accordingly\n20 “does not infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.”  Id. at 832.  When an\n21 agency does act to enforce, however, that action itself provides a focus for judicial review,\n22 inasmuch as the agency must have exercised its power in some manner.  Third, a refusal to\n23 institute enforcement proceedings is similar to a prosecutor’s decision not to indict, which\n24 decision “has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Ibid.  \n25 Our case is different from Chaney.  There, the agency simply refused to initiate an\n26 enforcement proceeding.  Here, by contrast, the agency has ended a program which has existed\n27 for five years affecting 689,800 enrollees.  Importantly, major policy decisions are “quite\n28 different from day-to-day agency nonenforcement decisions.”  National Treasury Employees\n19\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 20 of 49\n1 Union v. Horner, 854 F.2d 490, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Rather, broad enforcement policies “are\n2 more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the substantive statute rather than\n3 the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive an individual enforcement\n4 decision.”  Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \n5 Even defendants concede that where “the agency’s interpretation of a statute is embedded in a\n6 non-reviewable enforcement policy, the former may be reviewable as such” (Dkt. No. 218 at 3\n7 n.4).  Although they contend that the rescission memorandum “does not contain an embedded\n8 interpretation of the INA,” that assertion is incompatible with the Acting Secretary’s explicit\n9 references to the INA and the Attorney General’s determination that DACA was effectuated\n10 without “statutory authority.”  The first and third Chaney factors, accordingly, do not apply to\nt 11 the instant case.6  \nr\nu\no a 12 Chaney is also distinguishable because, unlike there, here the government reversed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 course after five years of inviting DACA recipients out of the shadows.  In contrast to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 nonenforcement decisions, “rescissions of commitments, whether or not they technically\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 implicate liberty and property interests as defined under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,\nS N 16 exert much more direct influence on the individuals or entities to whom the repudiated\nted  For the  17 commitments were made.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Through\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA, the government has invited undocumented aliens who meet threshold criteria to step\n19 forward, disclose substantial personal information, pay a hefty fee, and comply with ongoing\n20 conditions, all in expectation of (though not a right to) continued deferred action.  DACA\n21 allows enrollees to better plan their careers and lives with a reduced fear of removal.  DACA\n22 work authorizations, for example, allow recipients to join in the mainstream economy (and pay\n23 taxes).  DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least,\n24 if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good\n25 behavior.  This has become an important program for DACA recipients and their families, for\n26\n6  Contrary to defendants, Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir. 1990), is distinguishable\n27\non its facts.  There, the Fifth Circuit addressed a class action stemming from the Immigration and Naturalization\nService’s failure to adjudicate requests for voluntary departure.  The court of appeals determined that the district\n28\ncourt had improperly issued an injunction directing INS to consider particular grounds in deciding individual\nrequests for voluntary departure and employment authorization.  Id. at 1046.  \n20\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 21 of 49\n1 the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy.  An agency action to\n2 terminate it bears no resemblance to an agency decision not to regulate something never before\n3 regulated. \n4 Finally, there is law to apply.  The main, if not exclusive, rationale for ending DACA\n5 was its supposed illegality.  But determining illegality is a quintessential role of the courts.7  \n6 B. The INA Does Not Bar Review.\n7 The principle that courts owe substantial deference to the immigration determinations of\n8 the political branches is important and undisputed.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162\n9 (9th Cir. 2017).  That deference, however, does not remove the decision to rescind DACA from\n10 the ambit of judicial review.  Rather, the Supreme Court has applied the “strong presumption\nt 11 in favor of judicial review of administration action” in the immigration context.  See INS v.\nr\nu\no a 12 St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298–99 (2001). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In this connection, defendants raise two arguments.  First, they contend that review\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of discretionary enforcement decisions results in the inappropriate delay of removal, and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 accordingly prolongs violations of our immigration laws.  This argument, however, again\nS N 16 ignores that plaintiffs do not challenge any particular removal but, rather, challenge the abrupt\nted  For the  17 end to a nationwide deferred-action and work-authorization program.  In any individual case,\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA allows DHS to revoke deferred status and to deport.  Second, defendants assert that\n19 review of such decisions may involve disclosure of law enforcement priorities and\n20 foreign-policy objectives.  Neither concern is implicated here, as defendants’ stated reasons\n21 for the rescission all relate to the across-the-board cancellation of DACA based on supposed\n22 illegality, not to the facts particular to any proposed removal. \n23\n24\n25\n26\n7  Defendants are correct, of course, that a presumptively unreviewable agency action does not become\n27\nreviewable simply because “the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable action.”  ICC v.\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’s, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987).  As discussed above, however, the rescission of DACA\n28\nwas not such an unreviewable decision.\n21\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 22 of 49\n1 Nor does Section 1252(g) bar judicial review of the agency action in question.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1252(g) provides:\n3 Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . no court shall have\n4 jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\narising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to\n5 commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal\norders against any alien under this chapter.  \n6\nAs explained by the Supreme Court, this provision applies only to the three discrete\n7\ndecisions or actions named in Section 1252(g).  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.  Plaintiffs’ claims do\n8\nnot involve such decisions, but rather the challenge here is to the across-the-board cancellation\n9\nof a nationwide program.8 \n10\nDefendants recognize that these actions were brought prior to the commencement of\nt 11\nr\nu any removal proceedings.  Nevertheless, they argue that Section 1252(g) precludes review of\no a 12\nC ni\n  or plaintiffs’ claims because the decision to discontinue deferred action is “an ingredient to the\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  commencement of enforcement proceedings.”  It is true that eliminating DACA draws its\n Dis District  14 enrollees one step closer to deportation, but the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\ntates orthern  15 Section 1252(g) somehow precludes review of the “many other decisions or actions that may be\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 part of the deportation process.”  As AADC emphasized, “[i]t is implausible that the mention of\ni\nn three discrete events along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of referring to all claims\nU\n18\narising from deportation proceedings.”  Ibid.  \n19\nDefendants cite two decisions.  Importantly, however, both stemmed from already-\n20\ncommenced deportation or removal proceedings.  See Botezatu v. I.N.S., 195 F.3d 311, 312\n21\n(7th Cir. 1999) (declining to review a decision to deny deferred action after plaintiff had been\n22\nfound deportable); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 899–900 (3d Cir. 2016) (district court\n23\nlacked jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petition that claimed plaintiff was improperly denied\n24\nDACA relief).  \n25\nBy comparison, our court of appeals has held, following AADC, that Section 1252(g)\n26\ndoes not bar review of actions that occur “prior to any decision to ‘commence proceedings.’” \n27\n28\n8  The district court in Batalla Vidal also concluded that Section 1252(g) did not bar judicial review of\nchallenges to the DACA rescission.  Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 2017 WL 5201116, at *13.\n22\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 23 of 49\n1 Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 965 (9th Cir. 2004).  The claims in Kwai Fun\n2 Wong challenged the revocation of the plaintiff’s parole without first deciding her application\n3 for immigration relief, conduct which “resulted in the INS’s decision to commence removal\n4 proceedings and ultimately to remove” the plaintiff from the United States.  Id. at 959, 964. \n5 Contrary to defendants, it is immaterial that Kwai Fun Wong did not involve deferred action,\n6 as both the revocation of parole and the revocation of deferred action are “an ingredient” to the\n7 commencement of enforcement proceedings.  The jurisdictional limits of Section 1252(g) were\n8 instead “directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal\n9 proceedings.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.\n10 C. Most Plaintiffs Have Standing.\nt 11 To establish standing, Article III of the United States Constitution requires plaintiffs\nr\nu\no a 12 to show “(1) they suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 560–61 (1992)).  The standing inquiry is focused on whether the plaintiff has a sufficient\nS N 16 personal stake in the outcome of the controversy to ensure that the parties will be truly adverse\nted  For the  17 and their legal presentations sharpened.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).  Standing\ni\nn\nU\n18 must be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352\n19 (2006).\n20 Defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs have standing.  Rather, they argue\n21 in brief that the entity plaintiffs (the state and local governments, UC Plaintiffs, and SEIU Local\n22 521) lack Article III standing because the rescission does not regulate or restrict them in any\n23 way.  Defendants therefore posit that the entity plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are due only to\n24 “incidental effects” of the rescission, which defendants contend are insufficient to establish\n25 injury-in-fact.  As set forth below, these arguments lack merit.  \n26 First, California, Maryland, the City of San Jose, and the County of Santa Clara each\n27 employ DACA recipients, in connection with whom they have invested substantial resources\n28 in hiring and training.  Plaintiffs allege that they will not only lose these employees as work\n23\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 24 of 49\n1 authorizations expire, but that they will also need to expend additional resources to hire and train\n2 replacements.  San Jose further alleges that as a result of the rescission, the City has had\n3 decreased productivity, and that it has had to expend time and resources to deal with decreased\n4 employee morale (States Compl. ¶¶ 26–27, 32, 53; San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 49–50; Santa Clara\n5 Compl. ¶¶ 32–37; App. 11, 95–97, 706–07, 798, 1575–76). \n6 Second, Plaintiff States, including Maine and Maryland, stand to lose significant tax\n7 revenue as a result of the rescission (States Compl. ¶¶ 28–30, 37, 49–50, 70–71).  Although\n8 general allegations of injury to a state’s economy and the associated decline in general tax\n9 revenues may not be sufficient to establish standing, here, Plaintiff States sufficiently allege a\n10 “direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.”  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S.\nt 11 437, 448 (1992).  They allege, for example, that Maine stands to lose $96,000 in annual state\nr\nu\no a 12 and local taxes as DACA recipients leave the workforce (States Compl. ¶¶ 30, 38).  Evidence\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 submitted by plaintiffs supports these allegations, and demonstrates that DACA’s rescission\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 would reduce state and local tax contributions by DACA-eligible individuals by at least half\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (App. 68–74, 218–30). \nS N 16 Third, the University of California has also established that it will suffer injury to its\nted  For the  17 proprietary interests.  As declarations submitted by the University demonstrate, the rescission\ni\nn\nU\n18 has harmed the University in multiple ways.  Because DACA recipients can no longer seek\n19 advance parole, these students are unable to travel outside of the United States for research and\n20 educational conferences.  DACA recipients have also decided to cancel their enrollment in the\n21 University, and additional recipients are at risk of dropping out, because they would not be able\n22 to pay the cost of attendance without work authorizations. The University has also invested\n23 resources in recruiting and retaining DACA recipients as employees in various roles, including\n24 as teaching assistants and health care providers.  Such investments would be lost should these\n25 employees lose their ability to work in the United States.  \n26 California, Maryland, and Minnesota also allege injury to their public universities\n27 through harm to their educational missions and the loss of students and teachers.  According to\n28 the declarations filed by plaintiffs, the rescission, and the resulting loss of work authorization\n24\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 25 of 49\n1 and potential for deportation, will adversely impact the diversity of the talent pool of potential\n2 students, which will make it more difficult for the universities to fulfill their missions of\n3 increasing diversity (States Compl. ¶¶ 27, 55, 64–66; App. 12–16, 496–514, 884–90).  Our court\n4 of appeals recently affirmed the standing of two state governments to challenge an immigration\n5 policy that similarly harmed the plaintiffs’ public universities.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d\n6 1151, 1160–01 (9th Cir. 2017).  These injuries accordingly give the University of California and\n7 the States of California, Maryland, and Minnesota Article III standing.  Ibid. (citing Singleton v.\n8 Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114–16 (1976)).9\n9 Fourth, State Plaintiffs Maryland and Minnesota further allege that the rescission will\n10 negatively impact their public health programs.  In particular, Maryland and Minnesota allege\nt 11 that rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their employer-based health\nr\nu\no a 12 insurance, imposing higher healthcare costs on the state (State Compl. ¶¶ 51, 62).  These injuries\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are also sufficient to confer Article III standing.10  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Finally, SEIU Local 521 has associational standing to bring its claims on behalf of its\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 members who are DACA recipients.  An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nS N 16 members when:  (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right;\nted  For the  17 (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the\ni\nn\nU\n18 claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\n19 lawsuit.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock,\n20\n21\n9  The public universities of California, Maryland, and Minnesota are branches of the states under state\nlaw.  Campbell v. Regents of Univ. of California, 35 Cal. 4th 311, 321 (2005); Hanauer v. Elkins, 217 Md. 213,\n22\n219, 141 A.2d 903, 906 (Md. 1958); Univ. of Minn. v. Raygor, 620 N.W.2d 680, 683 (Minn. 2001).  \n23\n10  Although not discussed by the parties, the District of Columbia Circuit held that Joe Arpaio, Sheriff\nof Maricopa County, Arizona, lacked Article III standing to challenge DACA.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11\n24 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  While the court of appeals found that the plaintiff’s alleged harm — increased spending on\ncriminal investigation, apprehension, and incarceration — was sufficiently concrete, his theory that DACA\n25\nwould lead to an increased number of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in his jurisdiction was too\nspeculative.  Id. at 19–20.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs allege that the rescission will cause DACA recipients to\n26\nlose their work authorizations, and that plaintiffs will lose employees and students, suffer decreased tax revenue,\nand otherwise incur increased costs as a direct result.  This case is also different from Crane v. Johnson,\n27\n783 F.3d 244, 252 (5th Cir. 2015), where the Fifth Circuit held that Mississippi lacked standing to challenge\nDACA because it failed to submit evidence that DACA eligible immigrants resided in the state.  Defendants do\n28\nnot dispute State Plaintiffs’ allegations that hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients live in Plaintiff States.  \n25\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 26 of 49\n1 477 U.S. 274, 282 (1986) (quoting Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n,\n2 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  SEIU has established all three elements here.  SEIU has members\n3 who are DACA recipients.  Its constitution states that part of its mission is to provide its\n4 members with a voice in the larger community, and that its members should be treated equally\n5 with dignity regardless of immigration status or national origin.  SEIU has also formed a\n6 Committee on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a member-based committee that engages in\n7 organizing, advocacy, and education to help undocumented workers.  Its members’ interests in\n8 these actions are therefore germane to SEIU’s stated purpose (App. 801–09).  Furthermore, this\n9 action does not require the participation of SEIU’s individual members.  \n10 Defendants, in arguing that the entity plaintiffs lack standing, rely solely on Linda R.S. v.\nt 11 Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973).  There, the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a Texas\nr\nu\no a 12 state court’s interpretation of a child support statute.  Ibid.  The Supreme Court held that,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 although the plaintiff had alleged an injury, she had not shown “a direct nexus between the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 vindication of her interest and the enforcement of the State’s criminal laws” because the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 relationship between the state’s decision not to prosecute and the father’s decision not to pay\nS N 16 under the statute could “at best, be termed only speculative.”  Id. at 618–19.  Linda R.S. has no\nted  For the  17 application here.  As explained above, the entity plaintiffs have alleged harm to their proprietary\ni\nn\nU\n18 interests as a direct result of defendants’ decision to terminate the DACA program, most notably\n19 through its termination of work authorizations.  Accordingly, the entity plaintiffs have\n20 sufficiently alleged injury-in-fact traceable to the termination of DACA, and have demonstrated\n21 that these harms are redressable by their requested relief.11 \n22 Turning to prudential standing under the APA, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered\n23 or will suffer sufficient injury-in-fact, and that “the interest[s] sought to be protected by the\n24 complainant [are] arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the\n25 statute . . . in question.”  Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.\n26 479, 488 (1998).  \n27\n11  Because defendants’ conduct imposes direct injury on the State Plaintiffs’ proprietary interests, this\n28\norder need not reach defendants’ argument that the State Plaintiffs lack standing as parens patriae.\n26\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 27 of 49\n1 A plaintiff that is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action lacks prudential\n2 standing only where its interests “are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\n3 implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\n4 suit.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987).  This test is “not meant to be\n5 especially demanding,” and must be applied “in keeping with Congress’s evident intent when\n6 enacting the APA to make agency action presumably reviewable.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n7 Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quotations and citations\n8 omitted).  \n9 The parties’ briefs include only a cursory discussion of plaintiffs’ prudential standing\n10 under the APA.  Again, defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs also have\nt 11 statutory standing.  SEIU, which asserts the rights of its members who are DACA recipients,\nr\nu\no a 12 likewise seeks the protection of interests regulated by the INA.  Not all of the entity plaintiffs,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 however, have established prudential standing to proceed on their APA claims.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Plaintiffs primarily rely on our court of appeals’ recent decision in Hawaii v. Trump,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 859 F.3d 741, 765 (9th Cir. 2017), as well as on various provisions of the INA which provide for\nS N 16 student- and employment-related immigrant visas.  Plaintiffs do not contend, however, that their\nted  For the  17 DACA-recipient students or employees qualify for such visas.  Nor do plaintiffs point to\ni\nn\nU\n18 any provisions of the INA which indicate a protected interest in enrolling students with deferred\n19 action in their schools or universities.  Plaintiffs are also unable to point to any provision of the\n20 INA indicating that Congress intend to protected Plaintiff States’ interests in maintaining income\n21 tax revenue or avoiding increased healthcare costs.  \n22 By contrast, local and state governments San Jose, Santa Clara, California, and\n23 Maryland, as well as the University of California, have all identified injuries resulting from their\n24 status as employers, and allege harm caused by their employees’ future loss of deferred action\n25 and associated work authorization.  The INA gives the Executive Branch broad discretion to\n26 determine when noncitizens may work in the United States, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3), and\n27 regulations promulgated pursuant to this authority allow recipients of deferred action to apply\n28 for work authorization if they can demonstrate an “economic necessity for employment.” \n27\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 28 of 49\n1 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Moreover, the INA contains detailed provisions which subject\n2 employers to criminal and civil liability for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens, see 8 U.S.C.\n3 § 1324a(a)(1)(A), and for “continu[ing] to employ the alien in the United States knowing\n4 the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment,” id.\n5 § 1324a(a)(2).  The work authorization document that the agency issues to DACA recipients\n6 is one of the documents that is acceptable for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification,\n7 which employers must complete and retain for each individual they hire for employment in the\n8 United States (App. 2061–62).  Plaintiffs’ interest in their employees’ continued authorization\n9 to work in the United States is therefore “arguably within the zone of interests” that the INA\n10 protects.  Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 765; Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at 488.12\nt 11 Accordingly, even though the zone of interests inquiry is not demanding, this order\nr\nu\no a 12 concludes that Maine and Minnesota’s interests are “so marginally related” to the purposes\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 implicit in the INA that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 suit.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are accordingly DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The remaining entity plaintiffs, however, have established that their interests that support\nS N 16 Article III standing also satisfy the APA’s zone of interests test.  \nted  For the  17 *                        *                        *\ni\nn\nU\n18 Apart from the holding that Maine and Minnesota do not have statutory standing, the\n19 foregoing rejects all of the government’s jurisdictional arguments to dismiss plaintiffs’\n20 challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n21 2. PROVISIONAL RELIEF.\n22 Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to restore DACA.  To support a preliminary\n23 injunction, plaintiffs must establish four elements:  (1) likelihood of success on the merits;\n24 (2) irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in\n25\n26 12  Defendants’ sole argument against the entity plaintiffs’ prudential standing is that no provision\nof the INA protects the entity plaintiffs from “bearing the incidental effects” of a denial of deferred action. \n27\nThe case on which defendants rely, however, dealt with a private anti-immigration organization whose members\nwere not impacted by the immigration policy at issue.  See Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno,\n28 93 F.3d 897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 29 of 49\n1 their favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Resources\n2 Defense Council Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  As now explained, the record warrants most of the\n3 provisional relief requested.  \n4 A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n5 Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the rescission\n6 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with law. \n7 Specifically, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that:  (1) the agency’s decision to\n8 rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise; and (2) government counsel’s supposed\n9 “litigation risk” rationale is a post hoc rationalization and would be, in any event, arbitrary and\n10 capricious.\nt 11 (1) The Rescission was Based on a Flawed Legal Premise.\nr\nu\no a 12 The agency action was “not in accordance with law” because it was based on the flawed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 legal premise that the agency lacked authority to implement DACA.  When agency action is\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 based on a flawed legal premise, it may be set as aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532\nS N 16 (setting aside the EPA’s denial of a petition for rulemaking under the Clean Air Act for\nted  For the  17 supposed lack of authority); Safe Air for Everyone v. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007). \ni\nn\nU\n18 This order holds that DACA fell within the agency’s enforcement authority.  The contrary\n19 conclusion was flawed and should be set aside.  \n20 The administrative record includes the 2014 determination of the Office of Legal Counsel\n21 of the United States Department of Justice that programmatic deferred action is a permissible\n22 exercise of DHS’s enforcement discretion.  OLC noted that deferred action programs such as\n23 DACA are permissible so long as immigration officials retain discretion to evaluate each\n24 application on an individualized basis and so long as the concerns animating the program were\n25 consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration\n26 enforcement discretion.  OLC recognized that the “practice of granting deferred action date[d]\n27 back several decades,” and that “Congress has long been aware of the practice of granting\n28 deferred action, including in its categorical variety, and of its salient features; and it has never\n29\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 30 of 49\n1 acted to disapprove or limit the practice.”  Indeed, not only has Congress not limited the practice,\n2 but it has “enacted several pieces of legislation that have either assumed that deferred action\n3 would be available in certain circumstances, or expressly directed that deferred action be\n4 extended to certain categories of aliens” (AR 15–27). \n5 As explained in OLC’s opinion, each feature of the DACA program is anchored in\n6 authority granted or recognized by Congress or the Supreme Court.  Because this is the heart\n7 of the problem, and with apology for some repetition, this order will now examine each feature\n8 in turn.  \n9 The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible under the INA for “establishing\n10 national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  The Secretary is\nt 11 also charged with the administration and enforcement of the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1103.  In making\nr\nu\no a 12 immigration enforcement decisions, the executive “considers a variety of factors such as the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 danger posed to the United States of an individual’s unlawful presence, the impact of removal\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 on the nation’s international relations, and the ‘human concerns’ of whether the individual ‘has\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished\nS N 16 military service.’”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Arizona v. United\nted  For the  17 States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012)).  In instituting DACA, Secretary Napolitano explained that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the program was “necessary to ensure that [DHS’s] enforcement resources are not expended on\n19 [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement\n20 priorities” (AR 1).13\n21 As set forth above, deferred action originated without any statutory basis apart from the\n22 discretion vested by Congress in connection with the agency’s enforcement of the immigration\n23 laws.  Over the decades, however, deferred action became such a fixture that Congress referred\n24 to it by name in several INA amendments.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2) (stating that U visa\n25 and T visa applicants who were denied an administrative stay of removal were not precluded\n26 from applying for “deferred action”); 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (stating that eligible\n27\n13  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not reach the merits of\n28\nSheriff Joe Arpaio’s challenges to DACA and DAPA but instead dismissed the case for lack of Article III\nstanding.  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 15.\n30\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 31 of 49\n1 derivatives of VAWA petitioners were eligible for “deferred action” and work authorization); 8\n2 U.S.C. § 1151 note (stating that certain immediate family members of certain United States\n3 citizens “shall be eligible for deferred action”).  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action\n4 in enactments outside of the INA.  See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 30301 note (specifying that evidence of\n5 lawful status includes proof of “deferred action status”); USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L.\n6 No. 107-56, § 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (stating that immediate family members of legal\n7 permanent residents killed on September 11, 2001 “may be eligible for deferred action”). \n8 Congress has been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action,\n9 but it has yet to do so.  \n10 The Supreme Court has recognized the authority of DHS to grant relief from removal,\nt 11 Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396, and has specifically recognized deferred action as a way to exercise\nr\nu\no a 12 that discretion — “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the Executive’s] own convenience.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Notably, our court of appeals has said that “the exercise of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 prosecutorial discretion in deferred action flows from the authority conferred on the Secretary by\n  Di\nStates Northern  1156 IthI”e) .I1N4 A  .”  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 968 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Brewer\nted  For the  17 In extending programmatic deferred action to DACA enrollees, the agency acted within\ni\nn\nU\n18 the scope of this long and recognized practice.  In the exercise of its enforcement discretion and\n19 policy-making, the agency simply found that DACA enrollees represented low priority cases\n20 for removal and instituted DACA to manage that population while it redirected its resources\n21 elsewhere.  Even for enrollees approved under the program, DHS expressly retained the\n22 authority to terminate their deferred action at any time, in the agency’s discretion.  DACA\n23 provided no guarantee against removal.  \n24 Nevertheless, DACA has provided recipients with a major benefit, namely work\n25 authorizations for the period of deferral upon a demonstration of economic need.  This has\n26\n27\n14  In Brewer II, our court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  Circuit Judge Kozinski,\njoined by five other Circuit Judges, filed a dissent to the denial of the petition, expressing the view that DACA\n28\ndid not preempt Arizona’s law refusing to issue drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients.  855 F.3d at 958–62.\n31\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 32 of 49\n1 allowed DACA recipients to become part of the mainstream workforce and contribute openly\n2 to our economy.  Significantly, Section 1324a(h)(3) defines an “unauthorized alien” not entitled\n3 to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident nor “authorized\n4 to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”  In turn, the\n5 Secretary of Homeland Security has allowed work authorizations in cases of deferred action\n6 under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  As our court of appeals has stated, “the Executive Branch has\n7 determined that deferred action recipients — including DACA recipients — are ordinarily\n8 authorized to work in the United States.”  See Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1062.  \n9 It is also within the lawful authority of the agency to determine that DACA recipients\n10 do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry.  Pursuant to\nt 11 pre-existent DHS regulations and policy guidance, deferred action recipients already avoided\nr\nu\no a 12 accrual of “unlawful presence.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2);\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Memorandum for Field Leadership, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Operations Directorate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 for Purposes of Sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009). \nS N 16 Importantly, DHS excludes recipients of deferred action from being “unlawfully present”\nted  For the  17 because their deferred action is considered a period of stay authorized by the government.  See 8\ni\nn\nU\n18 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present if the alien is present “in\n19 the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\n20 [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]”); Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059.\n21 Allowing DACA recipients to apply for and obtain advance parole to travel overseas and\n22 return to the United States is also in accord with pre-existing regulations.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f);\n23 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (the Attorney General [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]\n24 may “in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he\n25 may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public\n26 benefit”).\n27 In short, what exactly is the part of DACA that oversteps the authority of the agency? \n28 Is it the granting of deferred action itself?  No, deferred action has been blessed by both the\n32\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 33 of 49\n1 Supreme Court and Congress as a means to exercise enforcement discretion.  Is it the granting\n2 of deferred action via a program (as apposed to ad hoc individual grants)?  No, programmatic\n3 deferred action has been in use since at least 1997, and other forms of programmatic\n4 discretionary relief date back to at least 1956.  Is it granting work authorizations coextensive\n5 with the two-year period of deferred action?  No, aliens receiving deferred action have been able\n6 to apply for work authorization for decades.  Is it granting relief from accruing “unlawful\n7 presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on reentry?  No, such relief dates back to the George\n8 W. Bush Administration for those receiving deferred action.  Is it allowing recipients to apply for\n9 and obtain advance parole?  No, once again, granting advance parole has all been in accord\n10 with pre-existing law.  Is it combining all these elements into a program?  No, if each step is\nt 11 within the authority of the agency, then how can combining them in one program be outside its\nr\nu\no a 12 authority, so long as the agency vets each applicant and exercises its discretion on a case-by-case\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 basis?\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Significantly, the government makes no effort in its briefs to challenge any of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 foregoing reasons why DACA was and remains within the authority of the agency.  Nor does the\nS N 16 government challenge any of the statutes and regulations under which deferred action recipients\nted  For the  17 obtain the foregoing benefits.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Instead, the administrative record shows that the Attorney General told the Acting\n19 Secretary that DACA was illegal.  First, the Attorney General said that DACA had been\n20 improperly adopted by the Obama Administration after “Congress’ repeated rejection of\n21 proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.”  But the proposals rejected\n22 by Congress markedly differ from DACA.  Importantly, while the proposed legislation would\n23 have offered Dreamers the ability to become lawful permanent residents, no comparable\n24 pathway was offered by DACA.  Our court of appeals recognized this distinction, noting that “the\n25 DREAM Act and the DACA program are not interchangeable policies because they provided\n26 different forms of relief.”  Brewer II, 855 F.3d at 976 n.10.  In fact, the 2012 DACA memo\n27 made explicit that DACA offered no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\n28 citizenship.  Secretary Napolitano concluded her memo by stating that DACA “confer[ed] no\n33\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 34 of 49\n1 substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.”  To claim that DACA was\n2 rejected by Congress, therefore, is unfair.15\n3 Second, another criticism of DACA was that applications received mechanical, routine\n4 approval without individualized consideration.  In her rescission memorandum, the Acting\n5 Secretary indicated that “[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] has not been\n6 able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic\n7 categorical criteria as outlined in the [original DACA] memorandum, but still had his or her\n8 application denied based solely upon discretion.”  The simple answer to this, if true, would be\n9 for the agency to instruct its adjudicators to exercise discretion, on a individualized basis, to\n10 make sure applicants do not pose a threat to national security or public safety and are otherwise\nt 11 deserving of deferred action.  \nr\nu\no a 12 It appears, moreover, that the Acting Secretary was in error when she said that USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 has been unable to identify discretionary denials of DACA applications.  She cited no evidence\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 for this fact, and none is found in the administrative record.  Possibly, the Acting Secretary relied\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 on findings made in the DAPA litigation.  There, the majority panel noted that USCIS could not\nS N 16 produce any applications that satisfied the guidelines of the original DACA memorandum but\nted  For the  17 were nonetheless refused through an exercise of discretion.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 172.  As the\ni\nn\nU\n18 dissent pointed out, however, the district court may have conflated rejections of DACA\n19 applications with denials, and as a result suggested that most denials were made for mechanical,\n20 administrative reasons.  Id. at 210 (King, J., dissenting).  A declaration submitted in that case by\n21 Donald Neufeld, then-Associate Director for Service Center Operations for USCIS, pointed to\n22 several instances of discretionary denials.  Id. at 175.  That same declaration explained that while\n23 a DACA application was rejected when it was “determined upon intake that the application [had]\n24 a fatal flaw,” an application was denied when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by-case basis,\n25 determined that the requestor either had not demonstrated that they satisfied the guidelines for\n26\n15  See, e.g., S. 1291, 107th Congress (2001); S. 1545, 108th Congress (2003); S. 2075, 109th Congress\n27\n(2005); H.R. 5131, 109th Congress (2006); H.R. 1275, 110th Congress (2007); S. 2205, 110th Congress (2007);\nH.R. 1751, 111th Congress (2009); S. 3827, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3962, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3992,\n28\n111th Congress (2010); H.R. 6497, 111th Congress (2010); S. 952, 112th Congress (2011). \n34\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 35 of 49\n1 DACA or when an adjudicator determined that deferred action should be denied even though\n2 the threshold guidelines were met.  Id. at 210–11 (dissent).  The United States District Court\n3 for the District of Columbia, in addressing nearly identical statistics, recognized the distinction. \n4 The district court noted that as of December 2014, 36,860 requests for deferred action under\n5 DACA were denied and another 42,632 applicants were rejected as not eligible, and concluded\n6 that such statistics “reflect that [] case-by-case review is in operation.”  Arpaio, 27 F. Supp. 3d\n7 at 209 n.13.  The administrative record tendered in our case completely fails to explain this\n8 apparent discrepancy.  \n9 Third, the main ground given by the Attorney General for illegality was the Fifth\n10 Circuit’s decision in the DAPA litigation.  DACA, the Attorney General said, suffered from the\nt 11 same “legal and constitutional defects” leveled against DAPA in Texas v. United States, 809\nr\nu\no a 12 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Upon consideration of the full history of that case, however, this was\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 an overstatement.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 In the DAPA litigation, the district court held that DAPA violated the APA’s notice-and-\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 comment procedures because it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the\nS N 16 status and employability of millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal\nted  For the  17 government.”  The district court found that the discretionary aspects of DAPA were “merely\ni\nn\nU\n18 pretext,” based on its finding that DACA had been implemented in such a mechanical way\n19 as to prevent the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis, and DAPA would therefore be\n20 implemented in the same manner.  Notice and opportunity for public comment, it held, should\n21 have accordingly been given.  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 671. \n22 Although the Fifth Circuit recognized that “there was conflicting evidence on the degree\n23 to which DACA allowed discretion,” because the government had failed to produce any\n24 applications that satisfied all of the criteria but were refused deferred action by an exercise of\n25 discretion, it was “not error — clear or otherwise —” for the district court to have concluded that\n26 DHS had only issued denials under mechanical formulae.  The appellate court also pointed to\n27 DACA’s Operating Procedures, which contained “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for\n28\n35\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 36 of 49\n1 granting or denying deferred action,” as supporting the conclusion that DACA did not leave the\n2 agency free to exercise discretion.  \n3 It cautioned, however, that “[f]or a number of reasons, any extrapolation from DACA\n4 must be done carefully.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 173 (emphasis added).  In particular, the appellate\n5 court recognized that DACA involved self-selecting applicants, and those who expected to be\n6 denied relief were unlikely to apply.  Id. at 174.  The court also recognized that “DACA and\n7 DAPA are not identical” and that because eligibility for DACA was restricted to a younger and\n8 less numerous population, DACA applicants were less likely to have backgrounds that would\n9 warrant a discretionary denial.  Ibid.\n10 In addition to affirming the notice-and-comment holding (over one dissent), two of the\nt 11 judges on the Fifth Circuit panel went a large step further and held that DAPA conflicted with\nr\nu\no a 12 the INA.  The majority pointed out that the INA already had a specific provision through which\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 aliens could derive lawful status from their children’s immigration status.  Id. at 180 n.167\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 1201(a), 1255).  DAPA, the majority\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 said, circumvented this statutory pathway.  \nS N 16 The Fifth Circuit also pointed out that the INA had specific provisions through which\nted  For the  17 aliens could be classified as “lawfully present,” could obtain discretionary relief from removal,\ni\nn\nU\n18 or could obtain eligibility for work authorization.  Because DAPA could make 4.3 million\n19 removable aliens eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and associated\n20 benefits, the Fifth Circuit concluded that DAPA implicated “questions of deep ‘economic and\n21 political significance’ that are central to [the INA’s] statutory scheme,” and therefore had\n22 Congress wished to assign that decision to an agency, “it surely would have done so expressly.”  \n23 The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that various provisions of the INA, such as the\n24 broad grant of authority to the agency in 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (providing that the Secretary “shall\n25 be responsible for establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities”),\n26 provided the authority to implement DAPA.  Rather, it found that such grants of authority could\n27 not reasonably be construed as assigning the agency decisions of such massive “economic and\n28 political significance.”  Such an interpretation, the majority said, would allow the agency to\n36\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 37 of 49\n1 grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States.  It\n2 concluded that “even with ‘special deference’ to the Secretary,” the INA did not permit the\n3 reclassification of 4.3 million aliens as “lawfully present,” thereby making them newly eligible\n4 for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\n5 The majority also rejected the argument that DAPA was moored in historical practice,\n6 finding that such historical practice “does not, by itself, create power,” and that in any event,\n7 previous deferred-action programs were not analogous to DAPA because most discretionary\n8 deferrals had been done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or\n9 natural disasters, or had been bridges from one legal status to another.  It found that “[n]othing\n10 like DAPA, which alters the status of more than four million aliens, has ever been contemplated\nt 11 absent direct statutory authorization.” \nr\nu\no a 12 The majority concluded that Congress had “directly addressed the precise question\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 at issue” in DAPA because the INA “prescribes how parents may derive an immigration\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 classification on the basis of their child’s status and which classes of aliens can achieve deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action and eligibility for work authorization.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186.  Because it found that\nS N 16 DAPA was foreclosed by Congress’s “careful plan,” the majority held that the program was\nted  For the  17 “manifestly contrary to the statute.”\ni\nn\nU\n18 While at least some of the majority’s reasons for holding DAPA illegal would apply to\n19 DACA, fairness requires saying that DACA and DAPA were different, as the panel opinion\n20 stated.  An important criticism against DAPA would not apply against DACA, namely the fact\n21 that Congress had already established a pathway to lawful presence for alien parents of citizens\n22 (so that DAPA simply constituted a more lenient substitute route).  DACA, by contrast, has no\n23 such analogue in the INA.  And, there is a difference between 4.3 million and 689,800.  Finally,\n24 the criticism that DACA had been mechanically administered without the exercise of discretion\n25 in individual cases, if true, could be fixed by simply insisting on exercise of discretion.  In sum,\n26 the DAPA litigation was not a death knell for DACA. \n27 This order holds that, in light of our own court of appeals’ reasoning in Brewer I and\n28 Brewer II, in light of the analysis of the Office of Legal Counsel of the United States Department\n37\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 38 of 49\n1 of Justice, and the reasoning set forth above, our court of appeals will likely hold that DACA\n2 was and remains a lawful exercise of authority by DHS.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed\n3 on the merits of their claim that the rescission was based on a flawed legal premise and must be\n4 set aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\n5 law.”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528; Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94\n6 (1943); Safe Air for Everyone, 488 F.3d at 1101.16  \n7 (2) Government Counsel’s Alternative Rationale \nIs Post Hoc and, in Any Event, Arbitrary, \n8 Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n9 Government counsel now advances an alternative rationale for the Secretary’s decision to\n10 rescind DACA.  Counsel contends that DHS acted within its discretion in managing its litigation\nt 11 exposure in the Fifth Circuit, weighing its options, and deciding on an orderly wind down of the\nr\nu\no a 12 program so as to avoid a potentially disastrous injunction in the Fifth Circuit.  This, they say,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 constituted a reasonable judgment call involving management of litigation risk and agency\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 resources.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Courts, of course, may not accept post hoc rationalizations for agency action, see\nS N 16 Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962), nor may they “supply a\nted  For the  17 reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Bowman Transp.,\ni\nn\nU\n18 Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., 419 U.S. 281, 285–86 (1974); see also Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n v.\n19 Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, No. 16-70481 at 15 (9th Cir. Jan. 8, 2018).  Rather, “an\n20 agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”  Motor\n21 Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50\n22 (1983).  \n23\n24\n16  Defendants argue that if the Acting Secretary had relied on DACA’s purported illegality in\n25\nterminating the program, that reliance should be presumed to be a “reasonable policy judgment that immigration\ndecisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.”  This argument finds no support in the administrative\n26\nrecord.  In Syracuse Peace Council v. F.C.C., upon which defendants rely, the agency explicitly based its\ndecision on the independent grounds that a policy was both unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest. \n27\n867 F.2d 654, 656 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Although the court of appeals elected to review only the agency’s policy\ndetermination under the APA, it noted that “if the Commission had written its opinion in purely constitutional\n28\nterms, we would have no choice but to address the constitutional issue.”  Id. at 659.\n38\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 39 of 49\n1 The reason actually given in the administrative record for the rescission was DACA’s\n2 purported illegality.  The Attorney General’s letter and the Acting Secretary’s memorandum can\n3 only be reasonably read as stating DACA was illegal and that, given that DACA must, therefore,\n4 be ended, the best course was “an orderly and efficient wind-down process,” rather than a\n5 potentially harsh shutdown in the Fifth Circuit.  Nowhere in the administrative record did\n6 the Attorney General or the agency consider whether defending the program in court would\n7 (or would not) be worth the litigation risk.  The new spin by government counsel is a classic\n8 post hoc rationalization.  That alone is dispositive of the new “litigation risk” rationale.\n9 Significantly, the INA itself makes clear that once the Attorney General had determined\n10 that DACA was illegal, the Acting Secretary had to accept his ruling as “controlling.”  Section\nt 11 1103(a)(1) of Title 8, a provision that allocates immigration power and duties among the\nr\nu\no a 12 Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, provides that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 “determinations and rulings by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 controlling.”  Therefore, once the Attorney General advised the Acting Secretary that DACA\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 was illegal, that ruling became “controlling” upon her.  She had no choice other than to end\nS N 16 DACA.  She had no room to push back with arguments for the program, to weigh litigation risks,\nted  For the  17 or to consider whether DACA recipients warranted fighting for.  The ruling of law by the\ni\nn\nU\n18 Attorney General, controlling upon her, made all such considerations moot.  Therefore, the new\n19 spin by government counsel that the decisionmaker here indulged in a litigation risk assessment\n20 and, out of caution, chose not to fight for the program in favor of an orderly wind-down is\n21 foreclosed by the INA itself.  Her wind-down references plainly presuppose that DACA had to\n22 end and the only question was how.  \n23 Nevertheless, this order now indulges government counsel’s new explanation and\n24 addresses whether it holds up even if taken as authentic.  In that event, two major criticisms can\n25 and should be made of the “litigation risk management” rationale.  \n26 First, even as to the risk in the Fifth Circuit, the administrative record mentions only\n27 similarities between DAPA and DACA (and even then only in an exceedingly conclusory way). \n28 No mention appears concerning the differences between DAPA and DACA that might have led\n39\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 40 of 49\n1 to a different result.  In addition to the distinctions made above, one powerful consideration\n2 should have been the doctrine of laches.  Unlike the DAPA challenge filed immediately after\n3 DAPA was announced, the threatened DACA challenge by ten states would have come five\n4 years after the program began and after hundreds of thousands of young adults had enrolled and\n5 entered the workforce.  See Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967) (adopting\n6 laches in APA context); see also Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 (D.D.C. 2014),\n7 aff’d, 797 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that even if plaintiff did have standing he could not\n8 demonstrate irreparable harm since he waited two years to challenge DACA).  Another\n9 difference was that DACA was precisely the kind of interstitial program of deferred action\n10 seemingly approved even by the Fifth Circuit, Texas, 809 F.3d at 185, given that both sides of\nt 11 the aisle and our two most recent presidents have called for Dreamer legislation.  Nor was there\nr\nu\no a 12 any mention of our own circuit’s more recent decision in Brewer II that favored DACA, or of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 recognition by the district court in the District of Columbia that DACA had, contrary to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Fifth Circuit, involved discretionary denials of DACA relief.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Second, if we are to indulge the spin that the decision to end DACA rested on a\nS N 16 litigation-management assessment (rather than on a ruling of illegality), then the Acting\nted  For the  17 Secretary committed a serious error.  Against the litigation risk the Acting Secretary should\ni\nn\nU\n18 have — but did not — weigh DACA’s programmatic objectives as well as the reliance interests\n19 of DACA recipients.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126–27\n20 (2016).  This responsibility lay with the Acting Secretary, not the Attorney General.  That is,\n21 once the Acting Secretary was informed of the supposed litigation risk, it remained her\n22 responsibility to balance it against competing policy considerations.  It remained her\n23 responsibility to recognize the litigation risk, yet still ask whether the program was worth\n24 fighting for.  The administrative record is utterly silent in this regard.  \n25 The agency reversed over five years of DHS policy, did so only one day after the\n26 Attorney General’s letter, and did so just three months after Secretary Kelly had continued the\n27 program (despite the Fifth Circuit’s decision and affirmance).  The Acting Secretary failed to\n28 provide a “reasoned explanation” as to why she was “disregarding facts and circumstances\n40\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 41 of 49\n1 which underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations,\n2 Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009).  \n3 Encino Motorcars seems very close on point.  There, the Supreme Court addressed the\n4 Department of Labor’s reversal of an interpretive regulation construing the Fair Labor Standard\n5 Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions for car dealership employees.  Our court of\n6 appeals gave Chevron deference to the new interpretation.  The Supreme Court reversed. \n7 In determining whether the regulation was “procedurally defective” — and accordingly whether\n8 the agency’s regulation warranted Chevron deference — the Supreme Court evaluated whether\n9 the agency had given adequate reasons for its decision to reverse course.  Encino Motorcars,\n10 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., 463 U.S. at 43).  The Supreme Court\nt 11 explained (at page 2126) that while agencies are free to change their existing policies, they must\nr\nu\no a 12 provide a reasoned explanation for a change (quotes and citations omitted):\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In explaining its changed position, an agency must also be\ni C\ntr of  cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious\n Dis District  14 rite liisa nnocet  tihnatet rfeusrttsh ethr ajtu smtiufsict abteio tna kise nd einmtoan adcecdo ubnyt .t h Ien m suecreh  fcaacstes\ntates orthern  15 odfis preogliacryd icnhga nfagcet;s  bauntd t hcairtc au mresatsaonnceeds  ethxaptl aunnadteiorlna yis o nre wedeered for\nS N 16 engendered by the prior policy.

As there,\n23\nthe administrative record here includes no analysis of the “significant reliance issues involved.” \n24\nThe parallel is striking.  In terminating DACA, the administrative record failed to address the\n25\n689,800 young people who had come to rely on DACA to live and to work in this country. \n26\nThese individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government,\n27\npaid hefty fees, and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA.  The administrative\n28\n41\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 42 of 49\n1 record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA\n2 recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.17\n3 Ironically, government counsel now cite material outside of the administrative record in\n4 an attempt to show the Acting Secretary considered the plight of DACA recipients (Dkt. 204 at\n5 10, 12, 19–20).  This press release came after the fact and was not part of the administrative\n6 record, and therefore cannot now rescue the agency.  In that respect, Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n,\n7 No. 16-70481 at 17 n.4 is analogous.  There, our court appeals refused to consider an agency’s\n8 position which was not advanced in connection with the decision under review but, rather, was\n9 offered for the first time afterwards.  \n10 Defendants next argue that because no statute here dictated the factors for an agency to\nt 11 consider in granting or rescinding deferred action, the agency need not have given weight to the\nr\nu\no a 12 benefits of the DACA program or the harm that would be caused to its recipients upon its\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 rescission.  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that “[c]onsideration of cost reflects\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 advantages and the disadvantages of agency decision.”  Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct.\nS N 16 2699, 2707 (2015).  While defendants attempt to distinguish Michigan on the ground that the\nted  For the  17 text of the statute required regulation there to be “appropriate and necessary,” they ignore that a\ni\nn\nU\n18 change in agency policy requires the agency to have “good reasons for it.”  Fox TV Stations,\n19 Inc., 556 U.S. at 515.  \n20 Defendants, of course, are correct that when an agency reverses policy it “need not\n21 demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n22 reasons for the old one.”  Ibid.  Where, however, an agency abruptly changes course and\n23 terminates a program on which so many people rely, the APA requires “a more detailed\n24 justification.”  Ibid.  Indeed, “[i]t would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.” \n25 Ibid.  In such cases, “it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy\n26 change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that\n27\n17  Here, perhaps in light of Encino Motors, the government does not argue that Chevron deference\n28\nshould be afforded to the Attorney General’s legal conclusion that DACA exceeded the agency’s authority. \n42\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 43 of 49\n1 underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. at 515–16.  Defendants’ attempt to portray\n2 DACA as a program that did not generate reliance interests is unconvincing.  As plaintiffs’\n3 evidence shows, DACA recipients, their employers, their colleges, and their communities all\n4 developed expectations based on the possibility that DACA recipients could renew their deferred\n5 action and work authorizations for additional two-year periods.  \n6 In sum, government counsel’s alternative spin on the administrative record is just a post\n7 hoc rationalization.  But, even if it had been the actual rationale, it was arbitrary, capricious, and\n8 an abuse of discretion under Encino Motors.  \n9 *                         *                         *\n10 Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nt 11 claim that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \nr\nu\no a 12 B. Irreparable Harm.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated that they are likely to suffer serious irreparable harm\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 absent an injunction.  Before DACA, Individual Plaintiffs, brought to America as children, faced\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 a tough set of life and career choices turning on the comparative probabilities of being deported\nS N 16 versus remaining here.  DACA gave them a more tolerable set of choices, including joining the\nted  For the  17 mainstream workforce.  Now, absent an injunction, they will slide back to the pre-DACA era and\ni\nn\nU\n18 associated hardship.\n19 The University of California and other entity plaintiffs have also demonstrated that they\n20 face irreparable harm as they begin to lose valuable students and employees in whom they have\n21 invested, and that loss of DACA recipients from the workforce will have a detrimental impact on\n22 their organization interests, economic output, public health, and safety.  \n23 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “prolonged separation from family\n24 members” and “constraints to recruiting and retaining faculty members to foster diversity and\n25 quality within the University community” are harms which are not compensable with monetary\n26 damages and therefore weigh in favor of finding irreparable harm.  Hawaii v. Trump,\n27 No. 17-17168, 2017 WL 6554184, at *22 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017).  These showings accordingly\n28\n43\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 44 of 49\n1 demonstrate that preliminary relief is appropriate.  Ibid.; see also Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting,\n2 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).\n3 Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs are likely to suffer such harms.  Rather, they\n4 argue that these harms will not happen before the phase-out begins on March 5, 2018, the date\n5 by which the undersigned judge had wanted to present a final record and final decision for\n6 appellate review.  \n7 Delays in this case, however, have made it impossible to send a final judgment to our\n8 court of appeals by March 5.  To take only one example, it would be unfair to reach a conclusion\n9 without giving plaintiffs an opportunity to examine the complete administrative record. \n10 Government counsel, however, succeeded in obtaining an order from the Supreme Court\nt 11 postponing proceedings on completing the administrative record until after ruling on its\nr\nu\no a 12 FRCP 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  As a result, we have yet to receive a complete administrative\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 record.  Although plaintiffs are likely to prevail on even the truncated administrative record, as\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 set forth above, our appellate court might disagree with that conclusion or the agency might seek\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 to cure the flaws in its process via a fresh agency action.  Plaintiffs are entitled to learn of all\nS N 16 flaws, if any more there be, lurking in the whole record.  One such possibility suggested by\nted  For the  17 plaintiffs is that the rescission was contrived to give the administration a bargaining chip to\ni\nn\nU\n18 demand funding for a border wall in exchange for reviving DACA.  A presidential tweet after\n19 our hearing gives credence to this claim.  Another possibility raised by plaintiffs is racial animus. \n20 These theories deserve the benefit of the full administrative record.  It will be impossible to\n21 litigate this case to a fair and final conclusion before March 5.18 \n22\n23\n24\n25\n18  On December 29, 2017, President Trump tweeted:  “The Democrats have been told, and fully\n26\nunderstand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an\nEND to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.  We must protect our\n27\nCountry at all cost!” (Dkt. No. 227-2).  Plaintiffs separately request judicial notice of this tweet.  Defendants\nobject to judicial notice on various relevancy grounds, but do not argue that it is not properly subject to judicial\n28\nnotice under FRE 201 (Dkt. Nos. 227, 230).  Plaintiffs’ request is accordingly GRANTED.  \n44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 45 of 49\n1 C. Balance of Equities and Public Interest.\n2 On provisional relief motions, district judges must consider whether (or not) such relief\n3 would be in the public interest.  On this point, we seem to be in the unusual position wherein the\n4 ultimate authority over the agency, the Chief Executive, publicly favors the very program the\n5 agency has ended.  In September, President Trump stated his support for DACA, tweeting: \n6 “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who\n7 have jobs, some serving in the military?  Really! . . . .”  He has also called upon Congress to\n8 ratify DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n9 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” (App. 1958). \n10 For the reasons DACA was instituted, and for the reasons tweeted by President Trump,\nt 11 this order finds that the public interest will be served by DACA’s continuation (on the conditions\nr\nu\no a 12 and exceptions set out below).  Beginning March 5, absent an injunction, one thousand\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 individuals per day, on average, will lose their DACA protection.  The rescission will result in\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 hundreds of thousands of individuals losing their work authorizations and deferred action status. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 This would tear authorized workers from our nation’s economy and would prejudice their being\nS N 16 able to support themselves and their families, not to mention paying taxes to support our nation. \nted  For the  17 Too, authorized workers will lose the benefit of their employer-provided healthcare plans and\ni\nn\nU\n18 thus place a greater burden on emergency healthcare services.  \n19 On provisional relief motions, district judges must also weigh the balance of hardships\n20 flowing from a grant versus denial of provisional relief.  The hardship to plaintiffs need not be\n21 repeated.  The only hardship raised by defendants is interference with the agency’s judgment on\n22 how best to allocate its resources in keeping our homeland secure, as well as its judgment in\n23 phasing out DACA.  Significantly, however, the agency’s judgment here was not based on a\n24 policy change.  It was based on a mistake of law.  If the instant order is correct that DACA fell\n25 within the statutory and constitutional powers of the Executive Branch, then a policy supported\n26\n27\n28\n45\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 46 of 49\n1 as high up as our Chief Executive has been the victim of a colossal blunder.  A preliminary\n2 injunction will set that right without imposing any policy unwanted by the Executive Branch.19\n3 D. Scope of Provisional Relief. \n4 For the foregoing reasons, defendants ARE HEREBY ORDERED AND ENJOINED, pending\n5 final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis on\n6 the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on September 5, 2017,\n7 including allowing DACA enrollees to renew their enrollments, with the exceptions (1) that new\n8 applications from applicants who have never before received deferred action need not be\n9 processed; (2) that the advance parole feature need not be continued for the time being for\n10 anyone; and (3) that defendants may take administrative steps to make sure fair discretion is\nt 11 exercised on an individualized basis for each renewal application.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Nothing in this order prohibits the agency from proceeding to remove any individual,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 including any DACA enrollee, who it determines poses a risk to national security or public\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 safety, or otherwise deserves, in its judgment, to be removed.  Nor does this order bar the agency\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 from granting advance parole in individual cases it finds deserving, or from granting deferred\nS N 16 action to new individuals on an ad hoc basis.  \nted  For the  17 The agency shall post reasonable public notice that it will resume receiving DACA\ni\nn\nU\n18 renewal applications and prescribe a process consistent with this order.  The agency shall keep\n19 records of its actions on all DACA-related applications and provide summary reports to the\n20 Court (and counsel) on the first business day of each quarter.20  \n21\n22\n19  If a likelihood of irreparable injury is shown and an injunction is in the public interest, a preliminary\ninjunction is also appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits are raised\n23\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n632 F.3d 1127, 1134–35 (9th Cir. 2011).  Because plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of\n24\nirreparable injury and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffs’ favor, preliminary relief would also\nbe appropriate under this alternative standard of review.  \n25\n20  A mandatory injunction orders a responsible party to take action, while “[a] prohibitory injunction\n26\nprohibits a party from taking action and preserves the status quo pending a determination of the action on the\nmerits.”  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1060.  The relevant status quo is the legally relevant relationship between the\n27\nparties before the controversy arose.  Id. at 1061.  Here, plaintiffs contest the validity of defendants’ rescission\nof DACA, the status quo before which was that DACA was fully implemented.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’\n28\nrequested preliminary injunction is not mandatory.  But even if it were, plaintiffs have demonstrated that\nsufficiently serious irreparable harm would result to warrant even a mandatory injunction.  \n46\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 47 of 49\n1 By way of explanation, while plaintiffs have demonstrated that DACA recipients,\n2 as well as their families, schools, employers, and communities, are likely to suffer substantial,\n3 irreparable harm as a result of the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to\n4 individuals who have never applied for or obtained DACA.  \n5 This order will not require advance parole.  Unlike the widespread harm to plaintiffs and\n6 our economy that would result were the 689,800 DACA enrollees to lose their ability to work in\n7 this country, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that comparable harm will occur as a result of\n8 DACA recipients’ inability to travel abroad.  True, Individual Plaintiffs Jirayut Latthivongskorn\n9 and Norma Ramirez describe professional disadvantages that may result if they are unable to\n10 travel internationally.  These, however, do not amount to hardships justifying a provisional\nt 11 injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole.  However, as\nr\nu\no a 12 stated, nothing in this order would bar individuals from asking for such agency relief or bar the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 agency from granting it in deserving cases.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 With respect to geographical scope, this order finds a nationwide injunction is\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 appropriate.  Our country has a strong interest in the uniform application of immigration law\nS N 16 and policy.  Plaintiffs have established injury that reaches beyond the geographical bounds\nted  For the  17 of the Northern District of California.  The problem affects every state and territory of the\ni\nn\nU\n18 United States. \n19 In February 2017, our court of appeals considered this very issue in Washington v.\n20 Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017), and upheld a nationwide injunction imposed by a\n21 single district court, observing that limiting the geographic scope of an injunction on an\n22 immigration enforcement policy “would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory\n23 requirements for uniform immigration law and policy” and that, as here, “the government ha[d]\n24 not proposed a workable alternative.”  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion in\n25 determining the appropriate scope of an injunction over DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88,\n26\n27\n28\n47\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 48 of 49\n1 holding that uniform application of the immigration laws justified a nationwide injunction.  So\n2 too here.21\n3 Limiting relief to the States in suit or the Individual Plaintiffs would result in\n4 administrative confusion and simply provoke many thousands of individual lawsuits all over the\n5 country.  The most practical relief is to maintain DACA in the same manner to which the agency\n6 and recipients are accustomed, subject to the exceptions above noted.  \n7 CONCLUSION\n8 Defendants’ motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1) is GRANTED IN PART only to the\n9 limited extent stated above and is otherwise DENIED.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are\n10 hereby DISMISSED.  Maine or Minnesota may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR\nt 11 DAYS from the date of this order to file a motion, noticed on the normal 35-day track, for leave to\nr\nu\no a 12 file an amended complaint.  A proposed amended complaint must be appended to the motion and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 amendments to the complaint cure the deficiencies identified herein.  To the extent stated above,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief is GRANTED.  A separate order will address defendants’\nS N 16 motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6).\nted  For the  17 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\ni\nn\nU\n18 Pursuant to our court of appeals’ order dated December 21, 2017, the district court\n19 hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues decided herein (i) whether (or not) the\n20 rescission of DACA is unreviewable as committed to agency discretion or by reason of 8 U.S.C.\n21 § 1252(g), (ii) whether (or not) plaintiffs have standing, and (iii) all other questions interposed\n22 by the government in its motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1).  This order finds that these are\n23 controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and\n24\n25\n21  Oddly, the government’s contrary authority is Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169–70 (9th Cir.\n1987), a decision in which our court of appeals upheld a nationwide injunction and held, “[t]here is no general\n26\nrequirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit,” and “nationwide relief in federal district or\ncircuit court [is permitted] when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal merely observed that “[w]here relief can be\n27\nstructured on an individual basis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.”  Id. at 1170. \nHere, it cannot be so structured.  Nor are any of the government’s other authorities, which restate the general\n28\nproposition that a remedy should match the injury alleged, see, e.g., Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,\n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017), to the contrary. \n48\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 83   Filed 01/09/18   Page 49 of 49\n1 that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the litigation.  This order\n2 realizes that the same issues are reviewable upon appeal of this injunction.  Nevertheless, out of\n3 caution and to avoid any problem concerning scope of review, the district court so certifies.  \n4\n5 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n6\n7 Dated:  January 9, 2018.                                                             \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n8 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n9\n10\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n49",

No 79).  \n24\nOn October 18, federal defendants filed this motion seeking a stay of certain\n25\nproceedings — including all discovery and further proceedings concerning composition of the\n26\nadministrative record — pending resolution of a writ of mandamus appealing the October 17\n27\norder, which writ they will file with our court of appeals no later than October 20 (Dkt. No. 81). \n28\nAll parties stipulated to an expedited briefing schedule, pursuant to which plaintiffs filed a\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 42   Filed 10/19/17   Page 2 of 4\n1 response at 5:00 p.m. today.  With the benefit of the parties’ briefing, this order now DENIES\n2 federal defendants’ motion for a stay.   \n3 Whether to grant a stay is, in the first instance, in the discretion of the district court. \n4 Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009).  That discretion is guided by a four-factor test, under\n5 which courts consider:  “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\n6 likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a\n7 stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n8 proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Ibid. (citations and quotations omitted).  \n9 These factors do not favor our federal defendants.  The contentions federal defendants\n10 rely upon in arguing that they are likely to succeed on the merits are largely duplicative of their\nt 11 arguments opposing completion of the administrative record, which were rejected by the\nr\nu\no a 12 October 17 order.  For the same reasons set forth therein, these arguments remain unavailing. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Federal defendants additional arguments are likewise unpersuasive.  They offer a strained and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 inaccurate interpretation of 8 U.S.C. 1252(g) in support of their position that the decision to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 rescind DACA is unreviewable.  Section 1252(g), however, only bars judicial review of\nS N 16 decisions “by the Attorney General to [1] commence proceedings, [2] adjudicate cases, or [3]\nted  For the  17 execute removal orders,” none of which are at issue here.  This provision has been “narrowly\ni\nn\nU\n18 construed” and is plainly inapplicable to this action.  See Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373\n19 F.3d 952, 964 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor does federal defendants’ argument regarding the Court’s\n20 position on whether Acting Secretary Elaine Duke is subject to deposition — a topic not yet\n21 formally raised in this action or properly the subject of defendants’ mandamus petition — show\n22 that they are likely to succeed.       \n23   Most importantly, a stay will likely result in substantial and irreparable harm to our\n24 plaintiffs, and to those parties most interested in these proceedings, people who are currently\n25 enrolled in DACA.  All face a March 5, 2018 deadline, on which date the Department of\n26 Homeland Security has determined to end DACA.  On that day, people currently living and\n27 working in the United States will begin to lose the protections afforded by DACA.  The Court\n28 intends to reach a decision before the March 5 deadline, on a substantial and complete record,\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 42   Filed 10/19/17   Page 3 of 4\n1 which can be reviewed by our court of appeals, and has set a schedule that will accomplish this. \n2 A stay risks allowing this deadline to pass without a decision on the merits, and therefore poses\n3 a substantial threat to our plaintiffs and to DACA enrollees.  \n4 Moreover, any alleged “irreparable harm” imposed upon the government related to their\n5 discovery burden pales in comparison to that which will be faced by DACA enrollees.  Nor will\n6 privileged government communications be publicly disclosed, as the undersigned judge has\n7 reviewed, and as necessary will continue to review such documents, submitted in camera, and\n8 withhold from public view those that require withholding.  \n9 Finally, the public’s interest is best served by a thorough, transparent, and expeditious\n10 resolution of this litigation.  Federal defendants’ argument that this action and one other lawsuit\nt 11 pending in New York have diverted resources from the Department of Homeland Security’s\nr\nu\no a 12 mission of protecting the United States is not well taken.  The federal government is certainly\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 equipped to participate in this litigation and continue to perform its core functions.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Though federal defendants analyze their motion under the four-factor test set forth\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 above, they also suggest that a different test applies here since they seek to stay a proceeding as\nS N 16 opposed to only staying an order or judgment.  That test asks “whether (1) resolution by the\nted  For the  17 Ninth Circuit of the issue addressed in [the appealed order] could materially affect this case and\ni\nn\nU\n18 advance the ultimate termination of litigation and (2) whether a stay will promote [ ] economy\n19 of time and effort for the Court and the parties.”  American Hotel & Lodging Ass'n v. City of\n20 Los Angeles, No. CV 14-09603-AB (SSX), 2015 WL 10791930, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2015)\n21 (Judge Andre Birotte Jr.) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  \n22 This, however, is mere slight of hand.  Federal defendants are not seeking to stay “all\n23 proceedings in the DACA cases” as they state in their notice of motion (Dkt. No. 81 at 1), but\n24 rather are seeking to “stay discovery and further proceedings concerning the composition of the\n25 administrative record pending a ruling on [their] upcoming motion to dismiss” as they clarify in\n26 their memorandum of points and authorities (id. at 1–2).  In other words, they are moving to\n27 stay the October 17 order — a motion to which the four-part Nken test applies — while\n28 continuing to litigate only their affirmative case.  This is improper.   \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 42   Filed 10/19/17   Page 4 of 4\n1 Even under the test set forth in American Hotel & Lodging, however, defendants motion\n2 still fails.  First, a stay will not promote economy of time and effort.  In fact, it will have the\n3 opposite effect.  It will prolong proceedings and in all likelihood duplicate efforts by creating a\n4 delay, which requires litigation first on the issue of provisional relief followed by a second\n5 round of litigation on the merits.  This will result in a waste of time and resources.  \n6 Second, staying discovery and proceedings concerning composition of the\n7 administrative record will not advance the litigation.  An appellate decision on the composition\n8 of the administrative record can be made now or later, as our court of appeals prefers, but we\n9 ought to continue making progress on the merits while that court considers the issue.    \n10 For the foregoing reasons, federal defendants’ motion to stay proceedings is DENIED. \nt 11 This action shall continue on the schedule set forth in the September 22 Scheduling Order (Dkt.\nr\nu\no a 12 No. 49).  Even in the unfortunate event that the administrative record is not settled (due to\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 appellate proceedings), our briefing schedule will nevertheless allow an orderly assessment of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 whether or not provisional relief is warranted.        \n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 IT IS SO ORDERED.\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20 Dated:   October 19, 2017.                                                                \n21 WILLIAM ALSUP\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n4",

For the reasons discussed below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nThis order incorporates the statement set forth in the order dated January 9, 2018,\n25\nlargely denying dismissal under FRCP 12(b)(1) and largely granting plaintiffs’ motion for\n26\nprovisional relief (Dkt. No. 234).  This order, however, addresses a separate motion by the\n27\ngovernment to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim for relief under FRCP 12(b)(6). \n28\nThis order sustains three claims for relief but finds that the rest fall short.  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 14\n1 ANALYSIS\n2 1. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n3   For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the\n4 rescission of DACA was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n5 accordance with law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as explained in the\n6 January 9 order, the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ APA claims under 5 U.S.C. §\n7 706(2)(A) is DENIED.\n8 2. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n9 The original DACA program began in 2012 without any notice or opportunity for public\n10 comment.  Likewise, the rescission in question ended DACA without notice or opportunity for\nt 11 public comment.  One issue now presented is whether the rescission is invalid for having been\nr\nu\no a 12 carried out without notice-and-comment procedures.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Under the APA, an agency action must be set aside if it was done “without observance\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  An agency is required to follow\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 prescribed notice-and-comment procedures before promulgating certain rules.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \nS N 16 The Regulatory Flexibility Act further requires that notice-and-comment rulemaking include\nted  For the  17 an assessment of the impact on small entities.  5 U.S.C. § 604(a).  These requirements do not\ni\nn\nU\n18 apply, however, to general statements of policy.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  \n19 A general statement of policy “advis[es] the public prospectively of the manner in which\n20 the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d\n21 1006, 1012–13 (9th Cir. 1987).  Such policies also “serve to educate and provide direction to\n22 the agency’s personnel in the field, who are required to implement its policies and exercise its\n23 discretionary power in specific cases.”  Id. at 1013 (quotes and citations omitted).  “The critical\n24 factor” in determining whether a directive constitutes a general statement of policy is “the\n25 extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to\n26 exercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.” \n27 Ibid.  Thus, to qualify as a statement of policy two requirements must be satisfied:  (1) the\n28 policy operates only prospectively, and (2) the policy does “not establish a binding norm,” and\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 14\n1 is not “finally determinative of the issues or rights to which [it] address[es],” but instead leaves\n2 officials “free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise.”  Id. at 1014\n3 (quotes and citations omitted).  Under this standard, the rescission memorandum is a general\n4 statement of policy.\n5 This order rejects plaintiffs’ contention that the rescission could only be done through\n6 notice and comment.  For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed no notice\n7 and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.  \n8 Almost this exact problem was addressed in Mada-Luna.  There, our court of appeals\n9 held that the repeal of an INS policy under which applicants could seek deferred action was not\n10 subject to notice and comment.  It rejected the argument that the repeal could not constitute a\nt 11 general statement of policy because it diminished the likelihood of receiving deferred action for\nr\nu\no a 12 a class of individuals.  Id. at 1016.  Rather, because the original policy allowed for discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 and failed to establish a “binding norm,” the repeal of that policy also did not require notice and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 comment.  Id. at 1017.  So too here.  The DACA program allowed but did not require the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 agency to grant deferred action, and upon separate application, travel authorization, on a case-\nS N 16 by-case basis at the agency’s discretion.  Therefore, neither its promulgation nor its rescission\nted  For the  17 required notice and comment.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 Parco v. Morris, 426 F. Supp. 976 (E.D. Pa. 1977), on which plaintiffs heavily rely,\n19 does not warrant the conclusion that the rescission policy is a substantive rule.  Parco also\n20 addressed whether the rescission of an INS policy required notice and comment.  Notably, the\n21 government in Parco stipulated that the policy’s precipitous rescission was the sole reason for\n22 denial of the plaintiff’s application for immigration relief.  Id. at 984.  The district court\n23 determined that the repeal therefore left no discretion, explaining that “discretion” was stripped\n24 of all meaning where “one contends that under a certain regulation ‘discretion’ was exercised\n25 favorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal of the regulation, unfavorably in\n26 each such case.”  Ibid.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not allege that all deferred action\n27 applications under DACA were approved but now, after the rescission, all requests for deferred\n28 action will be denied.  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffs argue that the rescission memorandum is more than a policy because it creates\n2 a blanket prohibition against granting deferred action to DACA applicants.  Plaintiffs are\n3 correct that the rescission policy contains mandatory language on its face.  It is also true that the\n4 rescission memorandum categorically eliminates advance parole for DACA recipients. \n5 This comes closer to resembling a substantive rule.  However, it remains the case that because\n6 the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require notice and comment,\n7 a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.  Mada-Luna, 813 F.2d\n8 at 1017.  \n9 Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Section 706(2)(D) of the\n10 APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is accordingly GRANTED.\nt 11 3. DUE PROCESS CLAIMS.\nr\nu\no a 12 To assert a due process claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she has an interest in\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 liberty or property protected by the Constitution.  See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (1972).  Plaintiffs fail to make the threshold showing that they have a protected interest in the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 continuation of DACA and, accordingly, their due process claims based on the rescission must\nS N 16 be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged, however, that the agency’s changes to its\nted  For the  17 information-sharing policy are “fundamentally unfair.”  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. Deferred Action.\n19 Because discretionary immigration relief “is a privilege created by Congress, denial of\n20 such relief cannot violate a substantive interest protected by the Due Process clause.”  Munoz v.\n21 Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 30 (1996)). \n22 Moreover, “aliens have no fundamental right to discretionary relief from removal” for purposes\n23 of due process.  Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2004).  Our court of\n24 appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, since such relief\n25 is “entirely within the discretion of the Attorney General.”  Kwai Fun Wong v. United States,\n26 373 F.3d 952, 967–68 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor did an INS policy which allowed the agency to\n27 recommend deferred action as “an act of administrative choice” create substantive liberty\n28 interests.  Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1985).  These authorities\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 14\n1 foreclose any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in continued deferred action or\n2 advance parole under DACA.1\n3 Plaintiffs reply that even absent a protected interest in the initial, discretionary grant of\n4 deferred action, there is a protected interest in the renewal of DACA and its associated benefits. \n5 Yet a benefit is not a “protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it\n6 in their discretion.”  Castle Rock, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  Rather, an individual has a\n7 protected property right in public benefits where the rules conferring those benefits “greatly\n8 restrict the discretion” of the people who administer them.  Nozzi v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los\n9 Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs’ authorities confirm that the same\n10 principle applies in the context of renewing or retaining existing benefits.  Wedges/Ledges of\nt 11 California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 64 (9th Cir. 1994); Stauch v. City of\nr\nu\no a 12 Columbia Heights, 212 F.3d 425, 430 (8th Cir. 2000).  No such limitations on agency discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are alleged to have applied under DACA.  Rather, the USCIS DACA FAQs referenced by\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 plaintiffs in their complaints make clear that “USCIS retain[ed] the ultimate discretion to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether deferred action [was] appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines\nS N 16 [were] met” (Garcia Compl. ¶ 24 n.16; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; UC Compl., Exh. B; State\nted  For the  17 Compl., Exh. E).\ni\nn\nU\n18 Next, plaintiffs argue that once DACA status was conferred, and recipients organized\n19 their lives in reliance on the program’s protections and benefits, they developed interests\n20 protected by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ authorities, however, stand only for the\n21 uncontroversial proposition that once in possession of a particular benefit, the alteration,\n22 revocation or suspension of that benefit may implicate due process.2  Such a principle has no\n23 application where, as here, extant benefits are not impacted by a change in policy.  Indeed, there\n24 is no dispute that the rescission acts only prospectively.  That is, all existing DACA recipients\n25\n1  Plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish Romeiro de Silva on the ground that the INS policy there involved\n26\n“unfettered discretion,” whereas the exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA was guided by standard\noperating procedures, is unconvincing.  \n27\n2  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971); Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court For Dist. of Arizona,\n28\n349 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir. 2003); Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2017 WL 5176720, at *9\n(W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017).\n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 14\n1 will receive deferred action through the end of their two-year terms.  What they will not receive,\n2 if the rescission endures, will be DACA renewal, thereafter.  For this reason, Ixcot v. Holder,\n3 646 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011), and Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), which\n4 addressed whether amendments to the INA were impermissibly retroactive, do not compel a\n5 different result.\n6 Plaintiffs contend that the government’s communications with plaintiffs regarding\n7 renewals, its operation of the program, and the public promises of government officials\n8 “together created an understanding that DACA recipients were entitled to the continued benefits\n9 of the program so long as they met the renewal criteria” (Dkt. No. 205 at 29).  Plaintiffs are\n10 correct, of course, that claims of entitlement can be defined by “rules or mutually explicit\nt 11 understandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  Importantly, however, a\nr\nu\no a 12 person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 held, does not create a protected right if that belief is not mutually held by the government. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Gerhart v. Lake Cty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2011).  An agency’s past practice of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 generally granting a government benefit is also insufficient to establish a legal entitlement. \nS N 16 Ibid.\nted  For the  17 This order empathizes with those DACA recipients who have built their lives around\ni\nn\nU\n18 the expectation that DACA, and its associated benefits, would continue to be available to them\n19 if they played by the rules.  That expectation, however, remains insufficient to give rise to a\n20 constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment.  Because plaintiffs have failed to allege facts\n21 demonstrating a protected interest in DACA’s continuation or the renewal of benefits\n22 thereunder, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on the rescission\n23 must be GRANTED.  \n24 B. Information-Sharing Policy.\n25 Plaintiffs fare better with their substantive due process claim that DHS allegedly\n26 changed its policy with respect to the personal information provided by DACA recipients\n27 during the application process.  Plaintiffs allege that the government repeatedly represented\n28 that information provided by DACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 14\n1 purposes absent special circumstances, and that DACA recipients relied on these promises in\n2 submitting the extensive personal information needed to meet the program’s requirements.\n3 Defendants insist that the agency’s information-sharing policy remains unchanged. \n4 On a motion to dismiss, however, the well-pled factual allegations in a complaint must be\n5 accepted as true.  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir.\n6 2008).  Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that DHS changed its information-sharing policy such\n7 that now, rather than affirmatively protecting DACA recipients’ information from disclosure,\n8 the government will only refrain from “proactively” providing their information for purposes of\n9 immigration enforcement proceedings (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State\n10 Compl. ¶ 122).  \nt 11 Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged a “mutually explicit understanding” giving rise\nr\nu\no a 12 to a protected interest in the confidentiality of DACA recipients’ personal information. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 They allege that throughout DACA’s existence, DHS made affirmative representations as to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 how this information would (and would not) be used.  The policy stated (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126;\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State Compl. ¶ 121 (citing USCIS DACA FAQs)): \nS N 16 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nted  For the  17 tpor oIcCeEe dainndg sC uBnPle fsosr t hthee r pequurpeostsoer o mf eimetms tihgera ctiroitne reina ffoorrc ethmee insstuance\ni\nn of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set\nU\n18 forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance\n(www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred\n19 pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE.  The information\nmay be shared with national security and law enforcement\n20 agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\nincluding for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify\n21 or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for\nthe investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above\n22 information sharing policy covers family members and guardians,\nin addition to the requestor.  This policy, which may be modified,\n23 superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended\nto, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or\n24 benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party\nin any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n25\nThe language contained in the policy’s caveat, that it could “be modified, superseded,\n26\nor rescinded at any time,” is ambiguous.  One reading advanced by the government is that this\n27\ncaveat allows the agency to change how it treats information already received from DACA\n28\napplicants.  Another reading, however, is that it simply allows the government to change its\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 14\n1 policy in connection with future applicants.  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson’s\n2 December 2016 letter to United States Representative Judy Chu supports the later reading. \n3 He stated that, “[s]ince DACA was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that\n4 information provided by applicants . . . will not later be used for immigration enforcement\n5 purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security\n6 or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance\n7 of a notice to appear is required by law” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 36–37; State Compl. ¶ 98, Exh. F). \n8 This ambiguity presents a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings.  \n9 Taken as true at this stage, as must be done on a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion, plaintiffs’\n10 allegations regarding the government’s broken promise as to how DACA recipients’ personal\nt 11 information will be used — and its potentially profound consequences — “shock[s] the\nr\nu\no a 12 conscience and offend[s] the community’s sense of fair play and decency.”  Marsh v. County of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 San Diego, 680 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotes and citations omitted).  Defendants’\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on changes to the government’s\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 information-use policy is DENIED.  \nS N 16 4. EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL.\nted  For the  17 Plaintiffs bring claims for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government should not be\ni\nn\nU\n18 permitted to terminate DACA or use the information collected from applicants for immigration\n19 enforcement purposes. \n20 Defendants first contend that plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims fail because there is no\n21 recognized claim for relief based on estoppel.  The Supreme Court has refused to adopt,\n22 however, “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any circumstances run against the Government,”\n23 noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the Government can enforce the law free from\n24 estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum\n25 standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their Government.”  Heckler v.\n26 Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60–61 (1984).  Moreover, our court of\n27 appeals has addressed such claims on the merits, and has held that the government may be\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 9 of 14\n1 subject to equitable estoppel if it has engaged in “affirmative misconduct.”  Watkins v. U.S.\n2 Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706–07 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n3 To state an equitable estoppel claim against the government, a party must show\n4 (1) that the government engaged in “affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence”; and\n5 (2) “the government’s wrongful act will cause a serious injustice, and the public’s interest will\n6 not suffer undue damage” if the requested relief is granted.  Id. at 707.  “Neither the failure to\n7 inform an individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation\n8 constitute affirmative misconduct.”  Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 2000). \n9 Moreover, our court of appeals has defined “affirmative misconduct” to mean a “deliberate lie”\n10 or “a pattern of false promises.”  Socop-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001). \nt 11 The allegations in the complaints fail to meet this standard, inasmuch as no affirmative instances\nr\nu\no a 12 of misrepresentation or concealment have been plausibly alleged.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs are correct that estoppel “does not require that the government intend to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 mislead a party,” Watkins, 875 F.2d 707, but plaintiffs fail to explain how contradictory policies\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 under two different administrations add up to “affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence.”\nS N 16  Plaintiffs fail to allege, for example, that the government’s past statements regarding DACA’s\nted  For the  17 legality were a “deliberate lie” or more than mere negligence.  Nor have plaintiffs pleaded that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the alleged change in the agency’s information-use policy was the result of an affirmative\n19 misrepresentation.  Rather, they have merely alleged a change in policy.  Under plaintiffs’ theory\n20 new administrations would almost never be able to change prior policies because someone could\n21 always assert reliance upon the old policy.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ equitable\n22 estoppel claims is GRANTED. \n23 5. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS.  \n24 To state an equal protection claim plaintiffs must show that the rescission was motivated\n25 by a discriminatory purpose.  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (2015) (citing Vill. of\n26 Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977)).  Determining\n27 whether discrimination is a motivating factor “demands a sensitive inquiry into such\n28 circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 10 of 14\n1 266.  A plaintiff need not show that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the\n2 challenged action, but only that it was a “motivating factor.”  Ibid.  In analyzing whether a\n3 facially-neutral policy was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, district courts must consider\n4 factors such as whether the policy creates a disparate impact, the historical background and\n5 sequence of events leading up to the decision, and any relevant legislative or administrative\n6 history.  Id. at 266–68.3  \n7 First, Individual Plaintiffs and Santa Clara clearly allege that the rescission had a\n8 disproportionate impact on Latinos and Mexican nationals.  Indeed, such individuals account\n9 for 93 percent of DACA recipients (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 100, 151; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 9, 75). \n10 Defendants reply that this disparate impact is an accident of geography, not evidence of\nt 11 discrimination.  True, a disparate impact of a facially-neutral rule, standing alone, cannot\nr\nu\no a 12 establish discriminatory intent.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976).  Individual\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs and Santa Clara, however, have alleged a discriminatory impact only as a starting\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 point.  They also allege a history of bias leading up to the rescission of DACA in the form of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 campaign statements and other public comments by President Trump, as next discussed.4 \nS N 16 Second, plaintiffs allege that President Trump has, on multiple occasions since he\nted  For the  17 announced his presidential campaign, expressed racial animus towards Latinos and Mexicans. \ni\nn\nU\n18 When President Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, for example, he\n19 characterized Mexicans as criminals, rapists, and “people that have lots of problems.”  Three\n20 days later, President Trump tweeted that “[d]ruggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming\n21 across the southern border,” and asked, “When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?” \n22\n23\n3  The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), which addressed\nthe showing necessary for a defendant to be entitled to discovery on a selective-prosecution claim, has no\n24\napplication here.  Plaintiffs’ claims cannot fairly be characterized as selective-prosecution claims because they\ndo not “implicate the Attorney General’s prosecutorial discretion — that is, in this context, his discretion to\n25\nchoose to deport one person rather than another among those who are illegally in the country.”  Kwai Fun\nWong, 373 F.3d at 970.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that the agency’s decision to end a nationwide deferred action\n26\nprogram was motivated by racial animus towards a protected class.  \n27\n4  The City of San Jose’s equal protection claim falls a little short.  Rather than alleging a disparate\nimpact on a protected class, it alleges only that “[d]efendants’ actions target individuals for discriminatory\n28\ntreatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification” (San Jose Compl. ¶ 54).  For this reason,\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss San Jose’s equal protection claim is GRANTED.  \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 11 of 14\n1 During the first Republican presidential debate, President Trump claimed that the Mexican\n2 government “send[s] the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them.”  And in\n3 August 2017, he referred to undocumented immigrants as “animals” who are responsible for “the\n4 drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, MS 13” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶\n5 102–13, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 75–76).\n6 Circumstantial evidence of intent, including statements by a decisionmaker, may be\n7 considered in evaluating whether government action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. \n8 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68.  These statements were not about the rescission (which\n9 came later) but they still have relevance to show racial animus against people south of our\n10 border. \nt 11 Should campaign rhetoric be admissible to undermine later agency action by the victors? \nr\nu\no a 12 This order recognizes that such admissibility can readily lead to mischief in challenging the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 policies of a new administration.  We should proceed with caution and give wide berth to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 democratic process.  Yet are clear cut indications of racial prejudice on the campaign trail to be\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 forgotten altogether?\nS N 16 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “evidence of purpose beyond the face of the\nted  For the  17 challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause\ni\nn\nU\n18 claims.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017).  Washington found that\n19 President Trump’s statements regarding a “Muslim ban” raised “serious allegations and\n20 presented significant constitutional questions,” although it ultimately reserved consideration of\n21 plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Id. at 1167–68.  Citing to Washington, at least two district\n22 courts have since considered President Trump’s campaign statements in finding a likelihood of\n23 success on Establishment Clause claims.  See, e.g., Aziz v. Trump, 234 F. Supp. 3d 724, 736\n24 (E.D. Va. 2017) (Judge Leonie Brinkema); Hawai’i v. Trump, 245 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236 (D.\n25 Haw. 2017) (Judge Derrick Watson).  This order will follow these decisions and hold that, at\n26 least at the pleading stage, campaign rhetoric so closely tied to the challenged executive action is\n27 admissible to show racial animus.  \n28\n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 14\n1 Third, a final consideration is the unusual history behind the rescission.  DACA received\n2 reaffirmation by the agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be\n3 hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality). \n4 This strange about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration\n5 within the agency was bypassed (Garcia Compl. ¶ 154; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 8, 77).  \n6 That President Trump has at other times shown support for DACA recipients cannot wipe\n7 the slate clean as a matter of law at the pleading stage.  Although the government argues that\n8 these allegations fail to suggest that the Acting Secretary (as the purported decisionmaker)\n9 terminated DACA due to racial animus, plaintiffs have alleged that it was President Trump\n10 himself who, in line with his campaign rhetoric, directed the decision to end the program\nt 11 (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 11, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 21).\nr\nu\no a 12 Construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as must be done at the pleading stage,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 these allegations raise a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.  The fact-intensive inquiry needed to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether defendants acted with discriminatory intent cannot be made on the pleadings. \nS N 16 Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss Santa Clara’s and Individual Plaintiffs’ equal\nted  For the  17 protection claims must be DENIED.\ni\nn\nU\n18 State Plaintiffs allege an equal protection claim on the alternative theory that the\n19 rescission “violates fundamental conceptions of justice by depriving DACA grantees, as a class,\n20 of their substantial interests in pursuing a livelihood to support themselves and further their\n21 education” (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77).  Plaintiffs do not respond to the government’s arguments\n22 that this theory fails to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6).  Defendants’ motion to dismiss State\n23 Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is accordingly GRANTED.  \n24 6. DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n25 Defendants move to dismiss the Individual Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief. \n26 Individual Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief is also contained in their prayer for relief and,\n27 accordingly, the standalone claim is superfluous.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim is\n28 GRANTED.\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 14\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 Consistent with the foregoing, defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and\n3 DENIED IN PART as follows:\n4 • Plaintiffs’ APA claims are sustained, except for the following:  Garcia\n5 Complaint – Fifth Claim for Relief; UC Complaint – Second Claim for\n6 Relief; State Complaint – Second Claim for Relief; San Jose Complaint\n7 – Second Claim for Relief.\n8 • Plaintiffs’ Regulatory Flexibility Act claims are dismissed.\n9 • Plaintiffs’ due process claims are sustained, except for the following: \n10 UC Complaint – Third Claim for Relief; Garcia Complaint –\nt 11 First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on the rescission);\nr\nu\no a 12 Santa Clara Complaint – First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the rescission).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims are sustained, except for the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 following:  State Complaint – Sixth Claim for Relief; San Jose\nS N 16 Complaint – First Claim for Relief.\nted  For the  17 • Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims are dismissed.\ni\nn\nU\n18 • Individual Plaintiffs’ declaratory relief claim is dismissed.  \n19 Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR DAYS from the date of\n20 this order to file motions, noticed on the normal 35-day track, seeking leave to amend solely\n21 as to the claims dismissed above.  Proposed amended complaints must be appended to each\n22 motion and plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how\n23 the amendments to the complaints cure the deficiencies identified herein and should include as\n24 an exhibit a redlined or highlighted version of the complaints identifying all changes.  \n25 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\n26 The district court hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues of whether\n27 (i) President Trump’s campaign statements are properly considered in evaluating plaintiffs’\n28 equal protection claims, (ii) whether the Individual Plaintiffs’ and County of Santa Clara’s\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05235-WHA   Document 88   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 14\n1 allegations as pleaded state an equal protection claim, (iii) whether plaintiffs’ allegations\n2 concerning changes to the government’s information-sharing policy state a due process claim;\n3 (iv) whether plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under 5 U.S.C. § 553; and (v) whether\n4 plaintiffs have failed to state a due process claim based on the rescission of DACA.  This order\n5 finds that these are controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for\n6 difference of opinion and that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the\n7 litigation.  \n8\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n10\nt 11 Dated:  January 12, 2018.                                                            \nr\nu WILLIAM ALSUP\no a 12 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n14",

 state  \na  claim.  \n  \n  \n2   Indeed,  there  is  evidence  that  “Congress  originally  intended  that  parole  would  be  used  on  a  case-­‐by-­‐case  basis  on  behalf  of  \nindividual  aliens.”  Cong.  Research  Serv.,  Review  of  U.S.  Refugee  Resettlement  Programs  &  Policies  8  (1980);  see  also  S.  Rep.  No.  \n  \n89-­‐748,  at  17  (1965).  The  statute  was  amended

There  is  some  controversy  surrounding  this  number.   See  generally  Unconstitutionality  of  Obama’s  Executive  Actions  on  \nImmigration:  Hearing  Before  the  House  Comm.  on  the  Judiciary,  114th  Cong.  84–85  (2015)  (written  testimony  of  Professor  \n  \nStephen  H.  Legomsky).  But  even  the  lowest  reported  contemporary  estimate  was  that  100,000  people  would

 on  admission  after  specified  periods  of  “unlawful  \npresence.”  Additionally,  8  U.S.C.  §  1182(a)(9)(C)  provides  a  permanent  bar  on  admission  for  immigrants  who  have  accrued  an  \n  \naggregate  of  more  than  one  year  of  “unlawful  presence”  and  who  later  attempt  to  cross  the  border  clandestinely.  As  the  district  \ncourt  noted  below,  DHS  “excludes  recipients  of  deferred  action  from  being  ‘unlawfully  present’  because  their  deferred  action  is  \nconsidered  a  period  of  stay  authorized  by  the  government.”  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Cal.  v.  DHS,  279  F.  Supp.  3d  1011,  1039  (N.D.  Cal.  \n2018).  As  DHS  noted  in  its  DACA  Frequently  Asked  Questions  (FAQs),  “[f]or  purposes  of  future  inadmissibility  based  upon  \nunlawful  presence,  an  individual  whose  case  has  been  deferred  is  not  considered  to  be  unlawfully  present  during  the  period  in  \nwhich  deferred  action  is  in  effect.”  Importantly,  however,  “deferred  action  does  not  confer  lawful  status  upon  an  individual,  nor  \ndoes  it  excuse  any  previous  or  subsequent  periods  of  unlawful  presence.”  \nThe  FAQs  are  attached  as  an  exhibit  to  the  Regents  complaint,  and  are  cited  pervasively  throughout  the  Garcia  complaint.  See  \nUnited  States  v.  Ritchie,  342  F.3d  903,  908  (9th

 on  appeal.  \n  \n  \n8   This  bar  does  not  affect  a  plaintiff’s  ability  to  bring  freestanding  constitutional  claims.  See  Webster  v.  Doe,  486  U.S.  592,  601–05,  \n108  S.Ct.  2047,  100  L.Ed.2d  632  (1988);  Padula  v.  Webster,  822  F.2d  97,  101  (D.C.  Cir.  1987)  (“[E]ven  where  agency  action  is  \n  \n‘committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law,’  review  is

 case  a  refusal  by  the  agency  to  institute  proceedings  based  solely  on  the  belief  that  it  lacks  \n  \njurisdiction.  Nor  do  we  have  a  situation  where  it  could  justifiably  be  found  that  the  agency  has  “consciously  and  expressly  \nadopted  a  general  policy”  that  is  so  extreme  as  to  amount  to  an  abdication  of  its  statutory  responsibilities.  See,  e.g.,  Adams  \nv.  Richardson,  156  U.S.  App.  D.C.  267,  480  F.2d  1159  (1973)  (en  banc).  Although  we  express  no  opinion  on  whether  such  \ndecisions  would  be  unreviewable  under  §  701(a)(2),  we  note  that  in  those  situations  the  statute  conferring  authority  on  the  \nagency  might  indicate  that  such  decisions  were  not  “committed  to  agency  discretion.”  \nHeckler  v.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  821,  833  n.4,  105  S.Ct.  1649  (emphasis  added).  \n  \n10   We  reject  the  government’s  reading  of  Montana  Air,  under  which  the  Chaney  presumption  would  be  overcome  only  if  the  agency  \naction  is  based  on  a  belief  in  a  lack  of  jurisdiction,  and  the  refusal  to  enforce  is  so  extreme  as  to  become  an  abdication  of  the  \n  \nagency’s  statutory  responsibilities.  Both  Chaney  and  Montana  Air  make  clear  that  these  are  two  independent  exceptions  to  the  \nnarrow  rule  of  nonreviewability,  not  two  elements  of  a  single  test.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  at  833  n.4,  105  S.Ct.  1649;  Montana  Air,  898  \nF.2d  at  756.  \n  \n11   The  opinion  is  replete  with  equally  emphatic—and  equally  quotable—formulations  of  the  same  point.  See,  e.g.,  City  of  Arlington,  \n569  U.S.  at  301,  133  S.Ct.  1863  (“In  sum,  judges  should  not  waste  their  time  in  the  mental  acrobatics  needed  to  decide  whether  \n  \nan  agency’s  interpretation  of  a  statutory  provision  is  ‘jurisdictional’  or  ‘nonjurisdictional.’  Once  those  labels  are  sheared  away,  it  \nbecomes  clear  that  the  question  in  every  case  is,  simply,  whether  the  statutory  text  forecloses  the  agency’s  assertion  of  \nauthority,  or  not.”).  \n  \n12   The  Court  gave  as  an  example  a  prosecutor’s  refusal  to  institute  criminal  proceedings  based  on  her  “belief  ...  that  the  law  will  not  \nsustain  a  conviction.”  BLE,  482  U.S.  at  283,  107  S.Ct.  2360.  Such  a  belief  is  not  equivalent  to  a  conclusion  that  the  government  \n  \nlacked  the  power  to  institute  a  prosecution  in  the  first  place.  For  one  colorful  example,  in  Bond  v.  United  States,  prosecutors  \nmade  the  “surprising”  decision  to  charge  “an  amateur  attempt  by  a  jilted  wife  to  injure  her  husband’s  lover”  under  the  federal  \nstatute  implementing  the  international  Convention  on  Chemical  Weapons.  572  U.S.  844,  134  S.  Ct.  2077,  2083–84,  189  L.Ed.2d  1  \n(2014).  While  the  Court  ultimately  interpreted  the  statute  not  to  encompass  the  charged  conduct,  id.  at  2093–94,  no  one  \nsuggested  that  the  government’s  aggressive  decision  to  institute  the  prosecution  was  itself  ultra  vires.  \n  \n13   Because  we  take  this  doctrinal  course,  we  need  not  decide  whether  the  rescission  of  DACA  would  be  reviewable  absent  the  \nexception  reflected  in  Montana  Air  and  Chaney’s  footnote  four.  But  we  do  note  several  points.  First,  a  literal  reading  of  Chaney’s  \n   31  \n  \n\nRegents  of  the  University  of  California  v.  U.S.  Department  of...,  908  F.3d  476  (2018)     \n2018  WL  5833232  \n  \n   language  would  not  even  encompass  the  decision  to  rescind  DACA,  since  Chaney  by  its  own  terms  applies  only  to  “agency  \ndecisions  not  to  undertake  enforcement  action.”  470  U.S.  at  832,  105  S.Ct.  1649  (emphasis  added).  Nowhere  does  the  opinion  \nsuggest  the  broader  proposition  that  any  decision  simply  related  to  enforcement  should  be  presumed  unreviewable.  Our  court’s  \ndicta  in  Morales  de  Soto  v.  Lynch,  824  F.3d  822,  827  n.4  (9th  Cir.  2016),  which  addressed  a  completely  separate  issue  of  \njurisdiction  under  the  INA,  is  not  to  the  contrary.  Thus,  to  the  extent  that  the  Montana  Air  exception  might  not  seem  a  perfect  fit  \nfor  the  rescission  of  DACA—which  was  not  exactly  a  decision  not  to  enforce—the  Chaney  presumption  itself  shares  the  same  \ndefect.  There  is  no  daylight  between  the  Chaney  rule  and  the  Montana  Air  exception  in  terms  of  the  type  of  agency  action  to  \nwhich  they  apply.  So  if  the  rescission  of  DACA  were  outside  the  Montana  Air  exception  by  virtue  of  not  being  strictly  a  \nnonenforcement  decision,  it  would  also  fall  outside  the  Chaney  presumption  of  unreviewability  in  the  first  place.  \nSecond,  the  D.C.  Circuit  has  developed  a  line  of  cases  explaining  that  while  Chaney  bars  judicial  review  of  a  “single-­‐shot  \nnonenforcement  decision,”  on  the  other  hand,  “an  agency’s  adoption  of  a  general  enforcement  policy  is  subject  to  review.”  OSG  \nBulk  Ships,  Inc.  v.  United  States,  132  F.3d  808,  812  (D.C.  Cir.  1998)  (quoting  Crowley  Caribbean  Transp.,  Inc.  v.  Pena,  37  F.3d  671,  \n674–75  (D.C.  Cir.  1994)  );  see  also  Kenney  v.  Glickman,  96  F.3d  1118,  1123  (8th  Cir.  1996);  Nat’l  Treasury  Emps.  Union  v.  Horner,  \n854  F.2d  490,  496–97  (D.C.  Cir.  1988).  \nThus,  every  one  of  the  four  courts  that  has  considered  the  question  has  held  that  the  rescission  of  DACA  is  reviewable  under  the  \nAPA,  although  each  has  employed  slightly  different  reasoning  for  that  conclusion.  See  NAACP  v.  Trump,  298  F.  Supp.  3d  209,  \n226–34  (D.D.C.  2018);  Casa  de  Md.  v.  DHS,  284  F.  Supp.  3d  758,  769–70  (D.  Md.  2018);  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Cal.  v.  DHS,  279  F.  \nSupp.  3d  1011,  1029–31  (N.D.  Cal.  2018)  (decision  below);  Batalla  Vidal  v.  Duke,  295  F.  Supp.  3d  127,  147–52  (E.D.N.Y.  2017).  \n  \n14   After  hundreds  of  pages  of  briefing  and  over  an  hour  of  oral  argument,  it  remains  less  than  clear  how  “litigation  risk”  differs  from  \na  substantive  belief  that  DACA  is  illegal.  We  take  the  term  to  refer  to  a  concern  that  DACA  would  be  abruptly  enjoined,  regardless  \n  \nof  whether  the  program  was  illegal  or  not.  Of  course,  such  a  concern  is  not  independent  of  an  on-­‐the-­‐merits  assessment  of  \nDACA’s  legality.  \n  \n15   This  conclusion  is  only  bolstered  by  the  fact  that  the  government’s  production  of  the  “administrative  record”  in  this  case  includes  \nthe  entirety  of  the  three  published  judicial  opinions  in  the  Texas  litigation.  \n  \n  \n16   The  Acting  Secretary  did  reference  Texas  Attorney  General  Ken  Paxton’s  threat  to  amend  the  Texas  suit  to  include  DACA,  but  she  \ndid  so  in  the  “Background”  section  of  her  memorandum.  If  anything,  the  inclusion  of  the  threat  in  the  background  portion  \n  \nrenders  its  omission  from  the  list  of  factors  the  Acting  Secretary  was  actually  “[t]aking  into  consideration”  all  the  more  stark.  \n  \n17   Secretary  Kelly’s  references  to  the  factors  he  considered,  which  included  obviously  discretionary  considerations  such  as  “our  new  \nimmigration  enforcement  priorities,”  provided  a  further  model  for  how  to  describe  a  discretionary  decision,  which  Acting  \n  \nSecretary  Duke  also  chose  not  to  follow.  \n  \n18   Section  1252(g)  is  one  such  provision.  See  AADC,  525  U.S.  at  475,  119  S.Ct.  936  (describing  §  1252(g)’s  passage  as  part  of  IIRIRA).  \n  \n  \n19   In  its  response  and  reply  brief,  the  government  appears  to  argue  that  another  provision  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(b)(9),  also  \nstripped  the  district  court  of  jurisdiction.  Although  ordinarily  an  argument  not  raised  in  the  opening  brief  would  be  waived,  this  \n  \nargument  is  jurisdictional  so  we  must  consider  it.  See,  e.g.,  Embassy  of  the  Arab  Republic  of  Egypt  v.  Lasheen,  603  F.3d  1166,  \n1171  n.3  (9th  Cir.  2010)  (“[C]hallenges  to  subject  matter  jurisdiction  cannot  be  waived[.]”).  But  Section  1252(b)(9)  does  not  bar  \njurisdiction  here,  because  it  “appl[ies]  only  to  those  claims  seeking  judicial  review  of  orders  of  removal.”  Singh  v.  Gonzales,  499  \nF.3d  969,  978  (9th  Cir.  2007)  (citing  St.  Cyr,  533  U.S.  at  313,  121  S.Ct.  2271).  \n  \n20   “A  plaintiff  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction  must  establish  that  he  is  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits,  that  he  is  likely  to  suffer  \nirreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of  preliminary  relief,  that  the  balance  of  equities  tips  in  his  favor,  and  that  an  injunction  is  in  the  \n  \npublic  interest.”  Winter  v.  Nat.  Res.  Def.  Council,  Inc.,  555  U.S.  7,  20,  129  S.Ct.  365,  172  L.Ed.2d  249  (2008).  \n  \n21   The  government  does  not  argue  that  its  conclusion  is  entitled  to  Chevron  deference,  likely  because  “[d]eference  to  an  agency’s  \ninterpretation  of  a  statute  is  not  appropriate  when  the  agency  wrongly  ‘believes  that  interpretation  is  compelled  by  Congress.’  ”  \n  \nGila  River  Indian  Cmty.  v.  United  States,  729  F.3d  1139,  1149  (9th  Cir.  2013)  (quoting  PDK  Labs.  Inc.  v.  DEA,  362  F.3d  786,  798  \n(D.C.  Cir.  2004)  ).  \n  \n22   U.S.  Citizenship  &  Immigration  Services,  Number  of  Form  I-­‐821D,  Consideration  of  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals,  by  \nFiscal  Year,  Quarter,  Intake,  Biometrics  and  Case  Status  Fiscal  Year  2012–2017  (March  31,  2017).  The  number  of  initial  \n  \napplications  is  the  relevant  metric  because  renewal  applications  are  by  definition  limited  to  the  pool  of  those  already  approved  \n   32  \n  \n\nRegents  of  the  University  of  California  v.  U.S.  Department  of...,  908  F.3d  476  (2018)     \n2018  WL  5833232  \n  \nfor  DACA  at  least  once.  Therefore,  one  would  expect  an  even  lower  denial  rate  for  renewals.  \n  \n23   Judge  King’s  dissent  also  makes  the  critical  observation  that,  according  to  the  declarations  filed  in  that  case,  the  reason  DHS  \ncould  not  point  to  specific  instances  in  which  DACA  applicants  met  the  program  criteria  but  were  denied  as  a  matter  of  discretion  \n  \nwas  that  DHS  did  not  have  the  ability  to  track  and  sort  the  reasons  for  DACA  denials.  Texas,  809  F.3d  at  211  (King,  J.,  dissenting).  \n  \n24   The  government  has  submitted  a  letter  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  28(j),  informing  us  that  the  current  \nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security,  Kirstjen  Nielsen,  issued  a  new  memorandum  regarding  the  DACA  rescission  on  June  22,  2018.  In  \n  \nthe  memorandum,  Secretary  Nielsen  “provide[d]  additional  explanation  of  the  basis  for  the  DACA  rescission,”  in  response  to  an  \norder  filed  in  a  parallel  lawsuit.  The  government’s  letter  does  not  argue  that  the  Nielsen  memorandum  represents  fresh  agency  \naction  that  could  possibly  moot  this  appeal.  We  therefore  leave  it  to  the  district  court  in  the  first  instance  to  determine  the  \nadmissibility  of  Secretary  Nielsen’s  letter  given  that  it  cannot  possibly  be  a  part  of  the  administrative  record  in  this  case,  and  its  \nimpact,  if  any,  on  this  case.  And  to  the  extent  the  Nielsen  memorandum  is  offered  as  an  additional  justification  of  the  original  \nDACA  rescission,  we  do  not  consider  it  in  our  review  of  Acting  Secretary  Duke’s  decision  because  it  is  well-­‐settled  that  “we  will  \nnot  allow  the  agency  to  supply  post-­‐hoc  rationalizations  for  its  actions....”  San  Luis  &  Delta-­‐Mendota  Water  Auth.  v.  Jewell,  747  \nF.3d  581,  603  (9th  Cir.  2014).  \n  \n25   Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  the  district  court’s  dismissal  of  their  equitable  estoppel  claim.  \n  \n  \n26   The  Regents  argue  that  “the  agency’s  discretion  to  grant  deferred  action  on  the  basis  of  the  DACA  criteria  has  been  eliminated.”  \nThis  is  not  quite  right  either.  DHS’s  authority  to  grant  deferred  action  under  the  DACA  program  has  been  eliminated,  but  the  \n  \nDACA  criteria  themselves  are  some  of  those  that  have  traditionally  guided  immigration  enforcement  discretion.  See  Wadhia,  \nsupra,  at  57  (“DHS  used  traditional  humanitarian  factors  to  outline  the  parameters  for  the  DACA  program,  such  as  tender  age  and  \nlongtime  residence  in  the  United  States.”).  \n  \n27   DHS’s  DACA  FAQs  state  that  “[y]ou  may  be  considered  for  renewal  of  DACA  if  you  met  the  guidelines  for  consideration  of  Initial  \nDACA  (see  above)  AND  you:  [1]  Did  not  depart  the  United  States  on  or  after  Aug.  15,  2012,  without  advance  parole;  [2]  Have  \n  \ncontinuously  resided  in  the  United  States  since  you  submitted  your  most  recent  request  for  DACA  that  was  approved  up  to  the  \npresent  time;  and  [3]  Have  not  been  convicted  of  a  felony,  a  significant  misdemeanor,  or  three  or  more  misdemeanors,  and  do  \nnot  otherwise  pose  a  threat  to  national  security  or  public  safety.”  \n  \n28   Astonishingly,  this  sentence—which  appears  to  represent  a  change  from  the  prior  policy  of  affirmatively  protecting  information  \nfrom  disclosure—is  immediately  adjacent  to  DHS’s  assurance  that  nothing  has  changed.  Cf.  George  Orwell,  Nineteen  Eighty-­‐Four  \n  \n(1949),  at  175  (“Oceania  was  at  war  with  Eastasia:  Oceania  had  always  been  at  war  with  Eastasia.”).  \n  \n29   The  government  argues  that  the  statements  by  the  President  cited  in  the  complaints  do  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to  \nplausibly  allege  discriminatory  intent.  The  government  first  submits  that  nationality,  as  opposed  to  ethnicity,  is  not  an  invidious  \n  \nclassification,  and  that  many  of  the  cited  comments  go  only  to  Mexican  nationality.  “Often,  however,  the  two  are  identical  as  a  \nfactual  matter:  one  was  born  in  the  nation  whose  primary  stock  is  one’s  own  ethnic  group.”  St.  Francis  Coll.  v.  Al-­‐Khazraji,  481  \nU.S.  604,  614,  107  S.Ct.  2022,  95  L.Ed.2d  582  (1987)  (Brennan,  J.,  concurring).  And  plaintiffs  allege  discriminatory  intent  not  only  \ntoward  “Mexican  nationals,”  but  also  toward  “individuals  of  Mexican  heritage,  and  Latinos.”  \n  \n30   The  district  court  took  judicial  notice  of  one  such  statement  by  the  President:  “[o]n  December  29,  2017,  President  Trump  \ntweeted:  ‘The  Democrats  have  been  told,  and  fully  understand,  that  there  can  be  no  DACA  without  the  desperately  needed  WALL  \n  \nat  the  Southern  Border  and  an  END  to  the  horrible  Chain  Migration  &  ridiculous  Lottery  System  of  Immigration  etc.  We  must  \nprotect  our  Country  at  all  cost!’  ”  There  were  many  similar  statements  made  by  the  President  after  he  took  the  oath  of  office  \nleading  up  to  the  DACA  rescission  on  September  5,  2017.  \n  \n31   We  do  not  disagree  with  the  reasoning  of  Judge  Owens’s  concurring  opinion  that  the  likelihood  of  success  on  plaintiffs’  equal  \nprotection  claim  is  a  second,  alternative  ground  for  affirming  the  entry  of  the  injunction.  \n  \n  \n1   The  government  appears  to  share  this  view.  In  its  petition  for  certiorari  before  judgment,  the  government  asserted  that  “a  \nprimary  purpose  of  the  Acting  Secretary’s  orderly  wind-­‐down  of  the  DACA  policy  was  to  avoid  the  disruptive  effects  on  all  parties  \n  \nof  abrupt  shifts  in  the  enforcement  of  the  Nation’s  immigration  laws.  Inviting  more  changes  before  final  resolution  of  this  \nlitigation  would  not  further  that  interest.”  \n  \n   33  \n  \n\nRegents  of  the  University  of  California  v.  U.S.  Department  of...,  908  F.3d  476  (2018)     \n2018  WL  5833232  \n  \n2   As  for  the  government’s  appeal  from  the  motions  to  dismiss,  I  dissent,  for  reasons  stated  here,  from  the  majority’s  holding  to  \naffirm  the  district  court’s  denial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  Plaintiffs’  APA  arbitrary-­‐and-­‐capricious  claim  (Part  VI-­‐A).  However,  I  \n  \nconcur  in  the  majority’s  holding  to  affirm  the  district  court’s  dismissal  of  Plaintiffs’  APA  notice-­‐and-­‐comment  claim  (Part  VI-­‐B).  I  \nalso  concur  in  the  judgment  to  affirm  the  district  court’s  ruling  on  Plaintiffs’  Due  Process  claims  (Part  VI-­‐C;  Part  VI-­‐D).  And,  as  \nexplained  here  as  well,  I  agree  with  the  majority’s  decision  to  affirm  the  district  court’s  denial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  the  Equal  \nProtection  claim  (Part  VI-­‐E)  and  hold  that  the  Equal  Protection  claim  offers  an  alternative  ground  to  affirm  the  preliminary  \ninjunction.  \n  \n3   This  is  not  surprising:  §  202(5)  makes  the  Secretary  “responsible  for  ...  [e]stablishing  national  immigration  enforcement  policies  \nand  priorities.”  If  we  accept  that  this  broad,  discretion-­‐granting  statute  authorized  DACA’s  implementation,  it  surely  also  \n  \nsanctions  DACA’s  termination.  \n  \n4   Like  the  majority,  I  do  not  interpret  Trump  v.  Hawaii,  –––  U.S.  ––––,  138  S.  Ct.  2392,  201  L.Ed.2d  775  (2018),  to  preclude  review  \nof  the  President’s  statements  when  applying  the  Arlington  Heights  standard.  At  the  merits  stage,  the  district  court  can  still  decide  \n  \nwhether,  or  to  what  degree,  the  President’s  statements  betray  a  discriminatory  animus  behind  DACA’s  rescission.  \n  \n  \n \n  \n     \n  \n \n  \n   34  \n  ",

Decided December 20, 2017\n  PER CURIAM. \n  This case arises from five related lawsuits that chal-\nlenge a determination adopted by the Acting Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The deter-\nmination, announced by the Acting Secretary, is to take \nimmediate steps to rescind a program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, by March 5, 2018.  \nThe Acting Secretary stated that her determination was \nbased in part on the Attorney General’s conclusion that \nDACA is unlawful and likely would be enjoined in poten-\ntially imminent litigation. \n  The five suits were filed in the United States District \nCourt  for  the  Northern  District  of  California,  and  the \nplaintiffs in those actions are the respondents in the mat-\nter now before this Court.  The defendants in the District \nCourt,  and  the  petitioners  here,  include  the  Govern- \nment of the United States, the Acting Secretary, and the \nPresident of the United States, all referred to here as the \nGovernment. \n  In the District Court litigation respondents argue that \nthe Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA in \nthe near future is unlawful because, among other reasons, \nit violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including \nthe equal protection guarantee implicit in that Clause. \n  The issue to be considered here involves respondents’ \ncontention that the administrative record the Government \nfiled to support the Acting Secretary’s determination to \nrescind DACA is incomplete.  The record consists of 256 \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901572,3 152-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 8803 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  22  ooff  44\n2  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \npages of documents, and the Government contends that it \ncontains all of the nondeliberative material considered by \nthe  Acting  Secretary  in  reaching  her  determination.  \n(Nearly  200  pages  consist  of  published  opinions  from \nvarious federal courts.) \n  On  October  17,  the  District  Court,  on  respondents’ \nmotion, ordered the Government to complete the adminis-\ntrative record.  See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Department \nof Homeland Security, App. C to Pet. for Mandamus, 2017 \nWL 4642324 (ND Cal., Oct. 17, 2017) (District Court Or-\nder).  The details of that order are recounted further be-\nlow.  See infra, at 3. \n  The Government petitioned for a writ of mandamus in \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of \nAppeals, in a divided opinion, denied the Government’s \npetition.  See 875 F. 3d 1200 (2017). \n  On November 19, three days after the Court of Appeals \nissued its opinion, respondents moved the District Court \nto stay its order requiring completion of the administra-\ntive  record  until  after  the  District  Court  resolved  the \nGovernment’s motion to dismiss and respondents’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Motion to Stay in No. \n17–cv–5211 (Nov. 19, 2017), Doc. 190.  The District Court \ndid  not  grant  respondents’  request,  instead  staying  its \norder for one month. \n  Still objecting to the District Court’s order, the Govern-\nment now seeks relief in this Court.  It has filed here a \npetition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court, or, \nin the alternative, for a writ of certiorari to the Court of \nAppeals. \n  The Court now grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, \nvacates the order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, and remands the case. \n  The District Court’s October 17 order requires the Gov-\nernment  to  turn  over  all  “emails,  letters,  memoranda, \nnotes, media items, opinions and other materials” that fall \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901572,3 152-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 8803 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  33  ooff  44\n  Cite as: 583 U.

Under the specific facts of this \ncase, the District Court should have granted respondents’ \nmotion  on  November  19  to  stay  implementation  of  the \nchallenged October 17 order and first resolved the Gov-\nernment’s  threshold  arguments  (that  the  Acting  Secre-\ntary’s  determination  to  rescind  DACA  is  unreviewable \nbecause it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act \ndeprives the District Court of jurisdiction).  Either of those \narguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for \nthe District Court to examine a complete administrative \nrecord.  \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901572,3 152-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 8803 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  44  ooff  44\n4  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \n  On remand of the case, the Court of Appeals shall take \nappropriate  action  so  that  the  following  steps  can  be \ntaken.  The District Court should proceed to rule on the \nGovernment’s threshold arguments and, in doing so, may \nconsider  certifying  that  ruling  for  interlocutory  appeal \nunder 28 U. S. C. §1292(b) if appropriate.   Thereafter, the \nCourt of Appeals or the District Court in the first instance \nmay consider whether narrower amendments to the record \nare necessary and appropriate.  In any event, the District \nCourt  may  not  compel  the  Government  to  disclose  any \ndocument  that  the  Government  believes  is  privileged \nwithout first providing the Government with the oppor-\ntunity to argue the issue. \n  This order does not suggest any view on the merits of \nrespondents’ claims or the Government’s defenses, or that \nthe District Court’s rulings on the Government’s motion to \ndismiss and respondents’ motion for preliminary injunc-\ntion should be delayed. \n  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth \nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nIt is so ordered.

Argued November 12, 2019—Decided June 18, 2020*  \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo-\nrandum announcing an immigration relief program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows certain unauthor-\nized aliens who arrived in the United States as children to apply for a \ntwo-year forbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief become \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  Some  \n700,000 aliens have availed themselves of this opportunity. \n     Two years later, DHS expanded DACA eligibility and created a re-\nlated program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).  If implemented, that program \nwould have made 4.3 million parents of U.  S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents eligible for the same forbearance from removal, work  \neligibility, and other benefits as DACA recipients.  Texas, joined by 25 \nother States, secured a nationwide preliminary injunction barring im-\nplementation of both the DACA expansion and DAPA.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit upheld the injunction, concluding that the program violated the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), which carefully defines eligi-\nbility for benefits.  This Court affirmed by an equally divided vote, and \n—————— \n*Together  with No. 18–588, Trump, President of the United States, et  \n \nal. v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et al., \non certiorari before judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for  \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and No. 18–589, Wolf, Acting Secretary \nof Homeland  Security, et al. v.  Batalla  Vidal et al., on certiorari before \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nthe litigation then continued in the District Court.   \n     In June 2017, following a change in Presidential administrations,  \nDHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum, citing, among other reasons, \nthe ongoing suit by Texas  and new policy priorities.  That September, \nthe Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nElaine C. Duke that DACA shared DAPA’s legal flaws and should also \nbe rescinded.  The next day, Duke acted on that advice.  Taking into \nconsideration the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court rulings and the At-\ntorney General’s letter, Duke decided to terminate the program.  She \nexplained that DHS would no longer accept new applications, but that \nexisting DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within six \nmonths could apply for a two-year renewal.  For all other DACA recip-\nients, previously issued grants of relief would expire on their own \nterms, with no prospect for renewal.   \n     Several groups of plaintiffs challenged Duke’s decision to rescind  \nDACA, claiming that it was arbitrary  and capricious in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and infringed the equal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  District  \nCourts in California (Regents, No. 18–587), New York (Batalla Vidal, \nNo. 18–589), and the District of Columbia (NAACP, No. 18–588) all  \nruled for the plaintiffs.  Each court rejected the Government’s argu-\nments that the claims were unreviewable under the APA and that the  \nINA deprived the courts of jurisdiction. In Regents and Batalla Vidal, \nthe District Courts further held that the equal protection claims were \nadequately alleged, and they entered coextensive nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs were likely \nto succeed on their APA claims.  The District Court in  NAACP took a \ndifferent approach.  It deferred ruling on  the equal protection chal-\nlenge but granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their \nAPA claim, finding that the rescission was inadequately explained.  \nThe court then stayed its order for 90 days to permit DHS to reissue a \nmemorandum rescinding  DACA, this time with a fuller explanation of \nthe conclusion that DACA was unlawful.  Two months later, Duke’s  \nsuccessor, Secretary Kirstjen M.  Nielsen, responded to  the court’s  or-\nder.  She declined to disturb or replace Duke’s rescission decision and \ninstead explained why she thought her predecessor’s decision was \nsound.  In addition to reiterating the illegality conclusion, she offered \nseveral new justifications for the rescission.  The Government moved  \nfor the District Court to reconsider in light of this additional explana-\ntion, but the court concluded that the new reasoning failed to elaborate \nmeaningfully on the illegality rationale.  \n     The Government appealed  the various District Court  decisions to  \nthe Second, Ninth, and D.  C. Circuits, respectively.  While those ap-\npeals were pending, the Government filed three petitions  for certiorari  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nbefore judgment.  Following  the Ninth Circuit affirmance in Regents, \nthis Court granted  certiorari.  \nHeld: The judgment in No. 18–587 is vacated in part and reversed in \npart; the judgment in No. 18–588 is affirmed; the February 13, 2018 \norder in No. 18–589 is vacated, the November 9, 2017 order is affirmed  \nin part, and the March 29, 2018 order is reversed in part; and all of the \ncases are remanded. \nNo. 18–587, 908 F. 3d 476, vacated in part and reversed in part; No. 18–\n588, affirmed; and No. 18–589, February  13, 2018 order vacated, No-\nvember 9, 2017 order affirmed in part, and March 29, 2018 order re-\nversed in part; all cases remanded. \n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to  \nPart IV, concluding: \n   1. DHS’s rescission decision  is reviewable under the APA and is \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.  Pp. 9–13. \n     (a) The APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” of agency ac-\ntion, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140, can be rebut-\nted by showing that the “agency action is committed to agency discre-\ntion by law,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  In Heckler v. Chaney, the Court held  \nthat this narrow exception includes an agency’s decision not to insti-\ntute an enforcement action.  470 U. S. 821, 831–832.  The Government  \ncontends that DACA is a general non-enforcement policy  equivalent to \nthe individual non-enforcement decision in  Chaney.  But the DACA  \nMemorandum  did not merely decline to institute enforcement proceed-\nings; it created a program for conferring  affirmative immigration re-\nlief.  Therefore,  unlike  the  non-enforcement  decision  in  Chaney, \nDACA’s creation—and its rescission—is an “action [that] provides a  \nfocus for judicial review.”   Id., at 832.  In addition, by virtue of receiving \ndeferred action, 700,000 DACA recipients may  request work  authori-\nzation and are eligible for Social Security and Medicare.  Access to such  \nbenefits is an interest “courts often are called upon to protect.”  Ibid.   \nDACA’s rescission is thus subject to review under the APA.  Pp. 9–12.\n     (b) The two jurisdictional provisions of the INA invoked by the \nGovernment do not apply.  Title 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), which bars re-\nview of claims arising from “action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to re-\nmove an alien,” is inapplicable where, as here, the parties do not chal-\nlenge any removal proceedings.  And the rescission is not a decision “to  \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders” \nwithin the meaning of §1252(g).  Pp. 12–13. \n   2. DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary  and capricious un-\nder the APA.  Pp. 13–26. \n     (a) In assessing the rescission, the Government urges the Court to \nconsider not just the contemporaneous explanation offered by Acting \nSecretary Duke but also  the additional reasons supplied by Secretary \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nNielsen nine months later.  Judicial review of agency action, however, \nis limited to “the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the \naction.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758.  If those grounds are \ninadequate, a court may  remand for the agency to offer “a fuller expla-\nnation of the agency’s reasoning at the time of the agency  action,” Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.  LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(emphasis added), or to “deal with the problem afresh” by taking  new  \nagency action, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.  S. 194, 201.  Because Sec-\nretary Nielsen chose not to take new action, she was limited to elabo-\nrating on the agency’s original reasons.  But her reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor and consists primarily of imper-\nmissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Citizens to Preserve  Overton Park, \nInc. v.  Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 420.  The rule requiring a new decision  \nbefore considering new reasons is not merely a  formality.  It serves \nimportant administrative law values by  promoting agency accounta-\nbility to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not \nsimply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.  \nEach of these values would be markedly undermined if this Court al-\nlowed DHS to  rely on reasons offered nine months after the rescission \nand after three different courts had identified flaws in the original ex-\nplanation.  Pp. 13–17. \n     (b)  Acting Secretary Duke’s  rescission memorandum failed to con-\nsider important aspects of the problem before the agency.  Although \nDuke was bound by the Attorney General’s determination that DACA \nis illegal, see 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1), deciding  how best to address that \ndetermination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.   \nActing Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority \nin winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope \nof her discretion.  The Attorney General concluded that the legal de-\nfects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.  \nThe Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on \nDAPA’s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it ex-\ntended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens.  But the \ndefining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHS’s decision to defer re-\nmoval, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance \ncomponent from the associated benefits eligibility.  Eliminating bene-\nfits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely \nwithin Duke’s  discretion.  Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in \nher decision, Duke treated the Attorney General’s conclusion regard-\ning the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and \nforbearance, without explanation.  That reasoning repeated the error \nin Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.  \nv. State Farm— treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy \nas sufficient to rescind the entire policy.   463 U. S. 29, 51.  While DHS \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \nwas not required to “consider all policy alternatives,” ibid., deferred \naction was “within the ambit of the existing” policy,  ibid.; indeed, it \nwas the centerpiece of the policy.  In failing to consider the option to \nretain deferred action, Duke “failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned \nanalysis.’ ” Id., at 57. \n \n   That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary  and capri-\ncious, but it was not the only defect.  Duke also failed to address \nwhether there was “legitimate reliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  \nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742.  Certain  \nfeatures of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance \ninterests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first \ninstance. DHS has flexibility in addressing  any reliance interests and \ncould have considered various accommodations.  While the agency was \nnot required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess \nthe existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them \nagainst competing policy concerns.  Its failure to do so was arbitrary  \nand capricious.  Pp. 17–26.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondents’ claims fail \nto establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by \nanimus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Pp. 27–29. \nROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the  Court, except as to Part IV.   \nGINSBURG,  BREYER,  and KAGAN, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and SO-\nTOMAYOR, J., joined as to all but Part IV.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt, except as to Part IV. \n  In the summer of 2012, the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) announced an immigration program known as \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  That \nprogram allows certain unauthorized aliens who entered \nthe United States as children to apply for a two-year for-\nbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief are also \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  \nSome  700,000  aliens  have  availed  themselves  of  this \nopportunity. \n  Five years later, the Attorney General advised DHS to \nrescind DACA, based on his conclusion that it was unlaw-\nful. The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memoran-\ndum terminating the program on that basis.  The termina-\ntion  was  challenged  by  affected  individuals  and  third\nparties who alleged, among other things, that the Acting \nSecretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by failing to adequately address important factors \nbearing on her decision.  For the reasons that follow, we \nconclude that the Acting Secretary did violate the APA, and \nthat the rescission must be vacated.  \nI \nA \n  In June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued \na memorandum announcing an immigration relief program \nfor “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 18–587, p. 97a  \n(App. to Pet. for Cert.).  Known as DACA, the program ap-\nplies to childhood arrivals who were under age 31 in 2012;\nhave continuously resided here since 2007; are current stu-\ndents, have completed high school, or are honorably dis-\ncharged veterans; have not been convicted of any serious \ncrimes; and do not threaten national security or public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsafety.  Id., at 98a.  DHS concluded that individuals who \nmeet these criteria warrant favorable treatment under the \nimmigration laws because they “lacked the intent to violate\nthe law,” are “productive” contributors to our society, and \n“know only this country as home.”  Id., at 98a–99a. \n  “[T]o prevent [these] low priority  individuals from being \nremoved from the United States,” the DACA Memorandum \ninstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “exer-\ncise prosecutorial discretion[] on an individual basis . . . by\n \ndeferring action for a period of two years, subject to re-\nnewal.”  Id., at 100a.  In addition, it directs U. S. Citizen-\nship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to “accept applica-\ntions to determine whether these individuals qualify for \nwork authorization during this period of deferred action,”  \nid., at 101a, as permitted under regulations long predating \nDACA’s creation, see 8  CFR §274a.12(c)(14) (2012) (permit-\nting work authorization for deferred action recipients who \nestablish “economic necessity”); 46 Fed. Reg. 25080–25081 \n(1981) (similar). Pursuant to other regulations, deferred ac-\ntion recipients are considered “lawfully present” for pur-\nposes of, and therefore eligible  to receive, Social Security  \nand Medicare benefits.  See 8 CFR §1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 CFR\n§417.422(h) (2012). \n  In November 2014, two years after DACA was promul-\ngated,  DHS  issued  a  memorandum  announcing  that  it \nwould expand DACA eligibility by removing the age cap, \nshifting the date-of-entry requirement from 2007 to 2010, \nand extending the deferred action and work authorization \nperiod to three years.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a–107a.  In \nthe same memorandum, DHS created a new, related pro-\ngram known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  That program \nwould have authorized deferred action for up to 4.3 million \nparents whose children were U. S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents.  These parents were to enjoy the same for-\nbearance,  work  eligibility,  and  other  benefits  as  DACA \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nrecipients.\n  Before the DAPA Memorandum was implemented, 26 \nStates, led by Texas, filed suit in the Southern District of \nTexas.  The States contended that DAPA and the DACA  \nexpansion violated the APA’s notice and comment require-\nment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the \nExecutive’s duty under the Take Care Clause of the Consti-\ntution. The District Court found that the States were likely \nto succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims and  \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring imple-\nmentation of both DAPA and the DACA expansion.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677–678 (2015). \n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.  Texas v. United  \nStates, 809 F. 3d 134, 188 (2015).  In opposing the injunc-\ntion, the Government argued that the DAPA Memorandum \nreflected an unreviewable exercise of the Government’s en-\nforcement discretion. The Fifth Circuit majority disagreed.  \nIt reasoned that the deferred action described in the DAPA  \nMemorandum was “much more than nonenforcement: It \nwould affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated \nbenefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”   Id., at 166.  \nFrom this, the majority concluded that the creation of the \nDAPA program was not an unreviewable action “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  Id., at 169 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2)).\n  The majority then upheld the injunction on two grounds.  \nIt first concluded the States were likely to succeed on their \nprocedural claim that the DAPA Memorandum was a sub-\nstantive rule that was required to undergo notice and com-\nment.  It then held that the APA required DAPA to be set \naside because the program was “manifestly contrary” to the \nINA, which “expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes” to “receive the benefits” as-\nsociated with “lawful presence” and to qualify for work  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthorization, 809 F. 3d, at 179–181, 186 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Judge King dissented. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote, which meant that no opinion was is-\nsued.  United States v.  Texas, 579 U. S. ___ (2016) (per cu-\nriam).  For the next year, litigation over DAPA and the\nDACA  expansion  continued  in  the  Southern  District  of \nTexas, while implementation of those policies remained \nenjoined. \n  Then, in June 2017, following a change in Presidential \nadministrations, DHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum.  \nIn explaining that decision, DHS cited the preliminary in-\njunction  and  ongoing  litigation  in  Texas,  the  fact  that \nDAPA had never taken effect, and the new administration’s  \nimmigration enforcement priorities.\n  Three  months  later,  in  September  2017,  Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson B. Sessions III sent a letter to Acting Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke, “advis[ing]” \nthat DHS “should rescind” DACA as well.  App. 877.  Citing\nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion and this Court’s equally divided \naffirmance, the Attorney General concluded that DACA \nshared the “same legal . . . defects that the courts recog-\nnized as to DAPA” and was “likely” to meet a similar fate.   \nId., at 878. “In light of the costs and burdens” that a rescis-\nsion would “impose[] on DHS,” the Attorney General urged \n \nDHS  to  “consider  an  orderly  and  efficient  wind-down \nprocess.”  Ibid.  \n  The next day, Duke acted on the Attorney General’s ad-\nvice.  In her decision memorandum, Duke summarized the  \nhistory of the DACA and DAPA  programs, the Fifth Circuit \nopinion and ensuing affirmance, and the contents of the At-\ntorney General’s letter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–117a.  \n“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the \nFifth Circuit’s rulings” and the “letter from the Attorney \nGeneral,” she concluded that the “DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Id., at 117a. \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Duke then detailed how the program would be wound \ndown: No new applications would be accepted, but DHS\nwould entertain applications for two-year renewals from \nDACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within \nsix months.  For all other DACA recipients, previously is-\nsued  grants  of  deferred  action  and  work  authorization  \nwould not be revoked but would expire on their own terms, \nwith no prospect for renewal.  Id., at 117a–118a. \nB \n  Within days of Acting Secretary  Duke’s rescission an-\nnouncement, multiple groups of plaintiffs ranging from in-\ndividual DACA recipients and States to the Regents of the \nUniversity of California and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People challenged her decision \nin the U. S. District Courts for the Northern District of Cal-\nifornia (Regents, No. 18–587), the Eastern District of New \nYork (Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589), and the District of Co-\nlumbia (NAACP, No. 18–588).  The relevant claims are that \nthe rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of\nthe APA and that it infringed the equal protection guaran-\ntee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.1  \n  All three District Courts ruled for the plaintiffs, albeit at \ndifferent stages of the proceedings.2  In doing so, each court \nrejected the Government’s threshold arguments that the \n—————— \n1Plaintiffs also raised notice and comment claims, which uniformly \n \nfailed below, and assorted due process challenges, some of which sur-\nvived motions to dismiss.  Those claims are not before us. \n2In a related challenge not at issue here, the District Court for the \n \nDistrict of Maryland granted partial summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment.  Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Se-\ncurity, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  After the Government filed petitions \nfor certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that deci-\nsion and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and ca-\npricious. Casa de  Maryland  v.  United States Dept. of Homeland Security, \n924 F. 3d 684 (2019), cert. pending, No. 18–1469.  The Fourth Circuit has  \nsince stayed its mandate.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims were unreviewable under the APA and that the INA \ndeprived the court of jurisdiction.  298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n223–224, 234–235 (DC 2018); 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1029–\n1033 (ND Cal. 2018); 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150, 153–154 \n(EDNY 2017).\nIn Regents and Batalla Vidal, the District Courts held  \nthat the equal protection claims were adequately alleged.  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1315 (ND Cal. 2018); 291 F. Supp. 3d \n260, 279 (EDNY 2018).  Those courts also entered coexten-\nsive nationwide preliminary injunctions, based on the con-\nclusion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the mer-\nits of their claims that the rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious. These injunctions did not require DHS to accept \nnew applications, but did order the agency to allow DACA\nrecipients to “renew their enrollments.”  279 F.  Supp. 3d, at \n1048; see 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437 (EDNY 2018). \nIn  NAACP,  the  D. C.  District  Court  took  a  different  \ncourse.  In  April 2018, it deferred ruling on the equal pro-\ntection challenge but granted partial summary judgment to \nthe plaintiffs on their APA claim, holding that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s “conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in [the agency’s] view of DACA’s lawful-\nness.”  298 F. Supp. 3d, at 243.  The District Court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit DHS to “reissue a memoran-\ndum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller expla-\nnation for the determination that the program lacks statu-\ntory and constitutional authority.”  Id., at 245.  \n  Two months later, Duke’s successor, Secretary Kirstjen \nM. Nielsen, responded via memorandum.  App. to Pet. for\nCert. 120a–126a.  She explained that, “[h]aving considered \nthe Duke memorandum,” she “decline[d] to disturb” the re-\nscission. Id., at 121a.  Secretary Nielsen went on to articu-\nlate her “understanding” of Duke’s memorandum, identify-\ning  three  reasons  why,  in  Nielsen’s  estimation,  “the\ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, \nsound.”  Ibid.  First, she reiterated that, “as the Attorney  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nGeneral concluded, the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  \nId., at 122a. Second, she added that, regardless, the agency\nhad “serious doubts about [DACA’s] legality” and, for law \nenforcement reasons, wanted to avoid “legally questiona-\nble” policies.   Id., at 123a.  Third, she identified multiple \npolicy reasons for rescinding DACA, including (1) the belief \nthat any class-based immigration relief should come from \nCongress,  not  through  executive  non-enforcement;  (2)\nDHS’s preference for exercising prosecutorial discretion on \n“a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and (3) the im-\nportance of “project[ing] a message” that immigration laws \nwould be enforced against all classes and categories of al-\niens.  Id., at 123a–124a.  In her final paragraph, Secretary \nNielsen acknowledged the “asserted reliance interests” in \nDACA’s continuation but concluded that they did not “out-\nweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the\nother reasons” for the rescission discussed in her memoran-\ndum.  Id., at 125a. \n  The Government asked the D. C. District Court to revise  \nits prior order in light of the reasons provided by Secretary \nNielsen, but the court declined.  In the court’s view, the new \nmemorandum, which “fail[ed] to elaborate meaningfully” \non the agency’s illegality rationale, still did not provide an \nadequate explanation for the September 2017 rescission.  \n315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 460, 473–474 (2018). \n  The Government appealed the various District Court de-\ncisions to the Second, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, respec-\ntively.  In November 2018, while those appeals were pend-\ning, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions \nfor certiorari before judgment.  After the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the nationwide injunction in  Regents, see 908 F. 3d  \n476 (2018), but before rulings from the other two Circuits, \nwe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases for ar-\ngument.  588 U. S. ___ (2019).  The issues raised here are  \n(1) whether  the  APA  claims  are  reviewable,  (2)  if  so, \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nwhether the rescission was arbitrary and capricious in vio-\nlation of the APA, and (3) whether the plaintiffs have stated \nan equal protection claim. \nII  \n  The dispute before the Court is not whether DHS may \nrescind DACA.  All parties agree that it may.  The dispute\nis instead primarily about the procedure the agency fol-\nlowed in doing so. \n  The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal\nagencies are accountable to the public and their actions \nsubject to review by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U. S. 788, 796 (1992).  It requires agencies to engage in\n“reasoned decisionmaking,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.  S.  \n743, 750 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), and di-\nrects that agency actions be “set aside” if they are “arbi-\ntrary” or “capricious,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  Under this \n“narrow standard of review, . . . a court is not  to substitute  \nits judgment for that of the agency,”  FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 513 (2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted), but instead to assess only whether the de-\ncision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors \nand whether there has been a clear error of judgment,” Cit-\nizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, \n416 (1971).\n  But before determining whether the rescission was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, we must first address the Govern-\nment’s contentions that DHS’s decision is unreviewable  \nunder the APA and outside this Court’s jurisdiction. \nA \n  The APA establishes  a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview [for] one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-\ntion.’”  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140  \n \n(1967) (quoting §702).  That presumption can be rebutted \nby a showing that the relevant statute “preclude[s]” review,  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n§701(a)(1),  or  that  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to \nagency discretion by law,” §701(a)(2).  The latter exception \nis at issue here. \n  To “honor the presumption of review, we have read the \nexception in §701(a)(2) quite narrowly,” Weyerhaeuser Co. \nv. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 12), confining it to those rare “adminis-\ntrative decision[s] traditionally left to agency discretion,”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 191 (1993).  This limited cat-\negory of unreviewable actions includes an agency’s decision \nnot  to  institute  enforcement  proceedings,  Heckler  v.  \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985), and it is on that ex-\nception that the Government primarily relies. \nIn  Chaney,  several  death-row  inmates  petitioned  the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to take enforcement \naction against two States to prevent their use of certain \ndrugs for lethal injection.  The Court held that the FDA’s \ndenial of that petition was presumptively unreviewable in \nlight of the well-established “tradition” that “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce” is “generally commit-\nted to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id.,  at 831.  We \nidentified a constellation of reasons that underpin this tra-\ndition. To start, a non-enforcement decision “often involves \na  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  \nare  peculiarly  within  [the  agency’s]  expertise,”  such  as \n“whether the particular enforcement action requested best \nfits the agency’s overall policies.”  Ibid.  The decision also  \nmirrors, “to some extent,” a prosecutor’s decision not to in-\ndict, which has “long been regarded as the special province\nof the Executive Branch.”  Id., at 832.  And, as a practical \nmatter, “when an agency refuses to act” there is no action \nto “provide[] a focus for judicial review.”  Ibid. \n \n  The Government contends that a general non-enforcement \npolicy  is  equivalent  to  the  individual  non-enforcement \ndecision at issue in  Chaney.  In each case, the Government  \nargues, the agency must balance factors peculiarly within  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nits expertise, and does so in a manner akin to a criminal \nprosecutor.  Building on that premise, the Government ar-\ngues that the rescission of a non-enforcement policy is no  \ndifferent—for purposes of reviewability—from the adoption \nof that policy.  While the rescission may lead to increased \nenforcement, it does not, by itself, constitute a particular  \nenforcement action.  Applying this logic to the facts here, \nthe Government submits that DACA is a non-enforcement  \npolicy and that its rescission is therefore unreviewable. \n  But we need not test this chain of reasoning because \nDACA is not simply a non-enforcement policy.  For starters, \nthe DACA Memorandum did not merely “refus[e] to insti-\ntute proceedings” against a particular entity or even a par-\nticular class.   Ibid.  Instead, it directed USCIS to “establish  \na clear and efficient process” for identifying individuals who \nmet the enumerated criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  \nBased on this directive, USCIS solicited applications from \neligible aliens, instituted a standardized review process, \nand sent formal notices indicating whether the alien would \nreceive the two-year forbearance.  These proceedings are ef-\nfectively “adjudicat[ions].”  Id., at 117a.  And the result of \nthese adjudications—DHS’s decision to “grant deferred ac-\ntion,” Brief for Petitioners 45—is an “affirmative act of ap-\nproval,” the very opposite of a “refus[al] to act,” Chaney, 470  \nU. S., at 831–832.  In short, the DACA Memorandum does \nnot announce a passive non-enforcement policy; it created \na program for conferring affirmative immigration relief.  \nThe creation of that program—and its rescission—is an “ac-\ntion [that] provides a focus for judicial review.”  Id., at 832. \n  The  benefits  attendant  to  deferred  action  provide \nfurther confirmation that DACA is more than simply a  \nnon-enforcement policy.  As described above, by virtue of \nreceiving deferred action, the 700,000 DACA recipients may \nrequest work authorization and are eligible for Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare.  See supra, at 3.  Unlike an agency’s re-\nfusal to take requested enforcement action, access to these \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \ntypes of benefits is an interest “courts often are called upon \nto protect.”  Chaney, 470 U. S., at 832.  See also Barnhart v.  \nThomas, 540 U. S. 20 (2003) (reviewing eligibility determi-\nnation for Social Security benefits).\n  Because the DACA program  is more than a non-enforce-\nment policy, its rescission is subject to review under the\nAPA.  \nB \n  The Government also invokes two jurisdictional provi-\nsions of the INA as independent bars to review.  Neither \napplies. \n  Section 1252(b)(9) bars review of claims arising from “ac-\ntion[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  66 \nStat. 209, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9).  That tar-\ngeted language is not aimed at this sort of case.  As we have  \nsaid before, §1252(b)(9) “does not present a jurisdictional \nbar” where those bringing suit “are not asking  for review of \nan order of removal,” “the decision . . . to seek removal,” or  \n“the process by which . .  . removability will be determined.”  \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (plu-\nrality opinion) (slip op., at 10–11);  id., at ___ (BREYER, J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 31).  And it is certainly not a bar\nwhere, as here, the parties are not challenging any removal \nproceedings.\n  Section 1252(g) is similarly narrow.  That provision limits \nreview of cases “arising from” decisions “to commence pro-\nceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.”  \n§1252(g). We have previously rejected as “implausible” the \nGovernment’s suggestion that §1252(g) covers “all claims \narising from deportation proceedings” or imposes “a general \njurisdictional  limitation.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 482 (1999).  The re-\nscission, which revokes a deferred action program with as-\nsociated benefits, is not a decision to “commence proceed-\nings,”  much  less  to  “adjudicate”  a  case  or  “execute”  a  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nremoval order. \n  With these preliminary arguments out of the way, we \nproceed to the merits. \nIII  \nA \n  Deciding  whether  agency  action  was  adequately  ex-\nplained  requires,  first,  knowing  where  to  look  for  the \nagency’s explanation. The natural starting point here is the \nexplanation provided by Acting Secretary Duke when she \nannounced the rescission in September 2017. But the Gov-\nernment urges us to go on and consider the June 2018 mem-\norandum submitted by Secretary Nielsen as well.  That  \nmemo was prepared after the D. C. District Court vacated  \nthe Duke rescission and gave DHS an opportunity to “reis-\nsue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing \na fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks statutory and constitutional authority.”  298 F. Supp. \n3d, at 245. According to the Government, the Nielsen Mem-\norandum is properly before us because it was invited by the \nDistrict Court and reflects the views of the Secretary of  \nHomeland Security—the official responsible for immigra-\ntion policy. Respondents disagree, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemorandum, issued nine months after the rescission, im-\npermissibly asserts prudential and policy reasons not relied \nupon by Duke. \n  It is a “foundational principle of administrative law” that \njudicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Michigan, \n576 U. S., at 758.  If those grounds are inadequate, a court \nmay remand for the agency to do one of two things: First, \nthe agency can offer “a fuller explanation of  the agency’s \nreasoning at the time of the agency action.” Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(1990)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Alpharma,  Inc.  v.  \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nLeavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 5–6 (CADC 2006) (Garland, J.) (per-\nmitting an agency to provide an “amplified articulation” of \na prior “conclusory” observation (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  This route has important limitations.  When  an  \nagency’s initial explanation “indicate[s] the determinative \nreason for the final action taken,” the agency may elaborate \nlater on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new \nones. Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam).  \nAlternatively,  the  agency  can  “deal  with  the  problem\nafresh” by taking new agency action.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U. S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II).  An agency taking \nthis route is not limited to its prior reasons but must comply \nwith the procedural requirements for new agency action. \n  The District Court’s remand thus presented DHS with a \nchoice: rest on the Duke Memorandum while elaborating on \nits prior reasoning, or issue a new rescission bolstered by \nnew reasons absent from the Duke Memorandum.  Secre-\ntary Nielsen took the first path. Rather than making a new\ndecision, she “decline[d] to disturb the Duke memoran-\ndum’s rescission” and instead “provide[d] further explana-\ntion” for that action.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.  Indeed,  \nthe Government’s subsequent request for reconsideration \ndescribed the Nielsen Memorandum as “additional expla-\nnation for [Duke’s] decision” and asked the District Court \nto “leave in  place [Duke’s] September 5, 2017 decision to re-\nscind the DACA policy.”  Motion to Revise Order in No. 17– \ncv–1907 etc. (D DC), pp. 2, 19. Contrary to the position of \nthe  Government  before  this  Court,  and  of  JUSTICE  \nKAVANAUGH in dissent, post, at 4 (opinion concurring in \njudgment in part and dissenting in part), the Nielsen Mem-\norandum was by its own terms not a new rule implementing \na new policy.\n  Because Secretary Nielsen chose to elaborate on the rea-\nsons for the initial rescission rather than take new admin-\nistrative action, she was limited to the agency’s original rea-\nsons, and her explanation “must be viewed critically” to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nensure that the rescission is not upheld on the basis of im-\npermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Overton Park, 401 \nU. S., at 420.  But despite purporting to explain the Duke \nMemorandum, Secretary Nielsen’s reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor.  Acting Secretary \nDuke  rested the rescission on the conclusion that DACA is \nunlawful.  Period.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.  By con-\ntrast, Secretary Nielsen’s new memorandum offered three \n“separate and independently sufficient reasons” for the re-\nscission, id., at 122a, only the first of which is the conclusion \nthat DACA is illegal. \n  Her second reason is that DACA is, at minimum, legally \nquestionable and should be terminated to maintain public\nconfidence in the rule of law and avoid burdensome litiga-\ntion.  No such justification can be found in the Duke Mem-\norandum. Legal uncertainty is, of course, related to illegal-\nity.  But the two justifications are meaningfully distinct, \nespecially in this context.  While an agency might, for one \nreason or another, choose to do nothing in the face of uncer-\ntainty, illegality presumably requires remedial action of \nsome sort.  \n  The policy reasons that Secretary Nielsen cites as a third \nbasis for the rescission are also nowhere to be found in the \nDuke Memorandum.  That document makes no mention of \na preference for legislative fixes, the superiority of case-by-\ncase decisionmaking, the importance of sending a message \nof robust enforcement, or any other policy consideration.  \nNor are these points included in the legal analysis from the \nFifth Circuit and the Attorney General.  They can be viewed\nonly as impermissible post hoc rationalizations and thus  \nare not properly before us.\n  The Government, echoed by JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, pro-\ntests that requiring a new decision before considering Niel-\nsen’s new justifications would be “an idle and useless for-\nmality.”  NLRB  v. Wyman-Gordon  Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766, \n \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nn. 6 (1969) (plurality opinion).  See also post,  at 5.  Proce-\ndural requirements can often seem such. But here the rule \nserves important values of administrative law.  Requiring \na new decision before considering new reasons promotes \n“agency accountability,” Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., \n476 U. S. 610, 643 (1986), by ensuring that parties and the \npublic can respond fully and in a timely manner to an \nagency’s exercise of authority.  Considering only contempo-\nraneous explanations for agency action also instills confi-\ndence that the reasons given are not simply “convenient lit-\nigating position[s].”  Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham  \nCorp., 567 U. S. 142, 155 (2012) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Permitting agencies to invoke belated justifica-\ntions, on the other hand, can upset “the orderly functioning \nof the process of review,” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. \n80, 94 (1943), forcing both litigants and courts to chase a\nmoving target.  Each of these values would be markedly un-\ndermined were we to allow DHS to rely on reasons offered \nnine months after Duke announced the rescission and after \nthree different courts had identified flaws in the original \nexplanation.\nJUSTICE  KAVANAUGH  asserts  that  this  “foundational \nprinciple of administrative law,” Michigan, 576 U. S., at \n758, actually limits only what lawyers may argue, not what \nagencies may do. Post, at 5.  While it is true that the Court \nhas often rejected justifications belatedly advanced by ad-\nvocates, we refer to this as a prohibition on post hoc ration-\nalizations, not advocate rationalizations, because the prob-\nlem is the timing, not the speaker.  The functional reasons \nfor  requiring  contemporaneous  explanations  apply  with \nequal force regardless whether post hoc justifications are \nraised in court by those appearing on behalf of the agency\nor by agency officials themselves.  See American Textile  \nMfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 539 (1981) \n(“[T]he post hoc rationalizations of the agency . . . cannot \nserve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”); Overton  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPark, 401 U. S., at 419 (rejecting “litigation affidavits” from \nagency officials as “merely ‘post hoc’ rationalizations”).3  \n  Justice Holmes famously wrote that “[m]en must turn  \nsquare corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock \nIsland, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143  \n(1920).  But it is also true, particularly when so much is at \nstake, that “the Government should turn square corners in \ndealing with the people.”  St. Regis Paper Co. v. United \nStates, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting).  The \nbasic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.  This is not the  \ncase for cutting corners to allow DHS to rely upon reasons \nabsent from its original decision.  \nB \n  We turn, finally, to whether DHS’s decision to rescind \nDACA  was arbitrary and capricious.  As noted earlier, Act-\ning Secretary Duke’s justification for the rescission was suc-\ncinct: “Taking into consideration” the Fifth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that DAPA was unlawful because it conferred benefits \nin violation of the INA, and the Attorney General’s conclu-\nsion that DACA was unlawful for the same reason, she \nconcluded—without elaboration—that the “DACA program \nshould be terminated.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.4  \n—————— \n3  JUSTICE  KAVANAUGH further argues that the contemporaneous expla-\nnation  requirement  applies  only  to  agency  adjudications,  not  rule-\nmakings.  Post,  at 5–6 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part).  But he  cites no  authority limiting this basic principle—\nwhich the Court regularly articulates in the context of rulemakings—to \nadjudications.  The Government does not even raise this unheralded ar-\ngument.  \n4The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke  also focused \n \non litigation risk.  Although the background section of her memo refer-\nences a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge \nDACA, the memo never asserts that the rescission was intended to avert \nlitigation.  And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that the policy \nwas unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or de-\nfended in its current form—it is difficult to see how the risk of litigation  \n \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Respondents maintain that this explanation is deficient \nfor three reasons.  Their first and second arguments work \nin tandem, claiming that the Duke Memorandum does not \nadequately explain the conclusion that DACA is unlawful,  \nand that this conclusion is, in any event, wrong.  While \nthose arguments carried the day in the lower courts, in our \nview they overlook an important constraint on Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s decisionmaking authority—she was bound by\nthe Attorney General’s legal determination. \n  The same statutory provision that establishes the Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security’s authority to administer and en-\nforce immigration laws limits that authority, specifying \nthat, with respect to “all questions of law,” the determina-\ntions of the Attorney General “shall be controlling.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1103(a)(1).  Respondents are aware of this con-\nstraint.  Indeed they emphasized the point in the reviewa-\nbility sections of their briefs.  But in their merits argu-\nments, respondents never addressed whether or how this \nunique statutory provision might affect our review.  They\ndid not discuss whether Duke was required to explain a le-\ngal conclusion that was not hers to make.  Nor  did they dis-\ncuss whether the current suits challenging Duke’s rescis-\nsion decision, which everyone agrees was within her legal \nauthority under the INA, are proper vehicles for attacking \nthe Attorney General’s legal conclusion. \n  Because of these gaps in respondents’ briefing, we do not\nevaluate the claims challenging the explanation and cor-\nrectness of the illegality conclusion.  Instead we focus our \nattention on respondents’ third argument—that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke “failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of\nthe  problem”  before  her.  Motor  Vehicle  Mfrs.  Assn.  of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983). \n—————— \ncarried any independent weight.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Whether DACA is illegal is, of course, a legal determina-\ntion, and therefore a question for the Attorney General.  But \ndeciding how best to address a finding of illegality moving \nforward can involve important policy choices, especially \nwhen the finding concerns a program with the breadth of \nDACA.  Those policy choices are for DHS. \n  Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretion-\nary authority in winding down the program.  See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 117a–118a (listing the Acting Secretary’s de-\ncisions on eight transition issues).   Among other things, she \nspecified that those DACA recipients whose benefits were \nset to expire within six months were eligible for two-year \nrenewals.  Ibid. \n  But Duke did not appear to appreciate the full scope of \nher discretion, which picked up where the Attorney Gen-\neral’s legal reasoning left off.  The Attorney General con-\ncluded that “the DACA policy has the same legal . . . defects \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  App. 878.  So, to \nunderstand those defects, we look to the Fifth Circuit, the  \nhighest court to offer a reasoned opinion on the legality \nof DAPA.  That court described the “core” issue before it as \nthe “Secretary’s decision” to grant “eligibility for benefits”—\nincluding  work  authorization,  Social  Security,  and \nMedicare—to unauthorized aliens on “a class-wide basis.”   \nTexas, 809  F. 3d, at 170; see id., at 148, 184. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit’s focus on these benefits was central to every stage of \nits analysis.  See id., at 155 (standing); id., at 163 (zone of\ninterest); id., at 164 (applicability of §1252(g));  id., at 166 \n(reviewability); id., at 176–177 (notice and comment); id., at  \n184 (substantive APA).  And the Court ultimately held that \nDAPA was “manifestly contrary to  the INA” precisely be-\ncause it “would make 4.3 million otherwise removable al-\niens” eligible for work authorization and public benefits.  \nId., at 181–182 (internal quotation marks omitted).5  \n—————— \n5As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social  \n \n \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  But there is more to DAPA (and DACA) than such bene-\nfits.  The defining feature of deferred action is the decision \nto defer removal (and to notify the affected alien of that de-\ncision). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a.  And the Fifth Circuit  \nwas careful to distinguish that forbearance component from \neligibility for benefits. As it explained, the “challenged por-\ntion of DAPA’s deferred-action program” was the decision \nto make DAPA recipients eligible for benefits.  See Texas, \n809 F. 3d, at 168, and n. 108.  The other “[p]art of DAPA,” \nthe court noted, “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at \nleast temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as \nto a class of what he deem[ed] to be low-priority illegal al-\niens.”  Id., at 166.  Borrowing from this Court’s prior de-\nscription of deferred action, the Fifth Circuit observed that \n“the states do not challenge the Secretary’s decision to ‘de-\ncline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or de-\ncline to execute a final order of deportation.’”  Id., at 168 \n \n(quoting Reno, 525 U. S., at 484).  And the Fifth Circuit un-\nderscored that nothing in its decision or the preliminary in-\njunction “requires the Secretary  to remove any alien or to\nalter” the Secretary’s class-based “enforcement priorities.”   \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 166, 169.  In other words, the Secre-\ntary’s forbearance authority was unimpaired. \n  Acting Secretary Duke recognized that the Fifth Circuit’s \nholding addressed the benefits associated with DAPA.  In  \nher memorandum she explained that the Fifth Circuit con-\n—————— \nSecurity and Medicare benefits because they had been designated “law-\nfully present.” Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 168.  Lawful presence is a statutory  \nprerequisite for receipt of  certain benefits.  See id., at 148 (citing 8  \nU. S. C. §1611).  It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexo-\nrably from forbearance.  Thus, while deferred action recipients have been \ndesignated lawfully present for purposes of Social Security and Medicare \neligibility, see 8 CFR §1.3; 42 CFR §417.422(h), agencies can also exclude \nthem from this designation, see 45 CFR §152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that \nDACA recipients are not considered lawfully present for purposes of cov-\nerage under the Affordable Care Act). \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncluded that DAPA “conflicted with the discretion author-\nized by Congress” because the INA “‘flatly does not permit \n \nthe reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully\npresent and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of \nfederal and state benefits, including work authorization.’”  \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 114a (quoting Texas, 809 F. 3d, at  \n184).  Duke did not characterize the opinion as one about \nforbearance. \n  In short, the Attorney General neither addressed the for-\nbearance policy at the heart of DACA nor compelled DHS \nto abandon that policy.  Thus, removing benefits eligibility \nwhile continuing forbearance remained squarely within the \ndiscretion of Acting Secretary Duke, who was responsible \nfor “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement poli-\ncies and priorities.” 116 Stat. 2178, 6 U. S. C. §202(5).  But \nDuke’s memo offers no reason  for terminating forbearance.  \nShe instead treated the Attorney General’s conclusion re-\ngarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both \nbenefits and forbearance, without explanation. \n  That reasoning repeated the error we identified in one of \nour leading modern administrative law cases, Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.  There, the Na-\ntional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) \npromulgated a requirement that motor vehicles produced \nafter 1982 be equipped with one of two passive restraints: \nairbags or automatic seatbelts.  463 U. S., at 37–38, 46.  \nFour years later, before the requirement went into effect, \nNHTSA concluded that automatic seatbelts, the restraint of  \nchoice for most manufacturers, would not provide effective \nprotection.  Based on that premise, NHTSA rescinded the \npassive restraint requirement in full.  Id., at 38. \n  We concluded that the total rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As we explained, NHTSA’s justification sup-\nported only “disallow[ing] compliance by means of ” auto-\n \nmatic seatbelts.  Id., at 47.  It did “not cast doubt” on the  \n \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n“efficacy  of  airbag  technology”  or  upon  “the  need  for  a \npassive restraint standard.”  Ibid.  Given NHTSA’s prior \njudgment that “airbags are an effective and cost-beneficial \nlifesaving  technology,”  we  held  that  “the  mandatory\npassive restraint rule [could] not be abandoned without any \nconsideration whatsoever of an airbags-only requirement.”  \nId., at 51. \n  While the factual setting is different here, the error is the \nsame.  Even if it is illegal for DHS to extend work authori-\nzation and other benefits to DACA recipients, that conclu-\nsion supported only “disallow[ing]” benefits.  Id., at 47.  It \ndid “not cast doubt” on the legality of forbearance or upon \nDHS’s original reasons for extending forbearance to child-\nhood arrivals.  Ibid.  Thus, given DHS’s earlier judgment \nthat  forbearance  is  “especially  justified”  for  “productive  \nyoung  people”  who  were  brought  here  as  children  \nand “know only this country as home,”  App. to Pet. for \nCert. 98a–99a, the DACA Memorandum could not be re-\nscinded in full “without any consideration whatsoever” of a \nforbearance-only policy, State Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.6  \n  The Government acknowledges that “[d]eferred action \ncoupled with the associated benefits are the two legs upon \nwhich the DACA policy stands.”  Reply Brief 21.  It insists, \nhowever, that “DHS was not required to consider whether \nDACA’s illegality could be addressed by separating” the \n—————— \n6The three-page memorandum that established DACA is devoted en-\n \ntirely to forbearance, save for one sentence directing USCIS  to “deter-\nmine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work authorization.”  App. \nto Pet. for Cert. 101a.  The benefits associated with DACA flow from a  \nseparate  regulation.  See  8  CFR  §1.3(a)(4)(vi);  see  also  42  CFR \n§417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR §1.3).  Thus, DHS could have ad-\ndressed the Attorney General’s determination that such benefits were \nimpermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR §1.3 to exclude DACA \nrecipients from those benefits without rescinding the DACA Memoran-\ndum and the  forbearance policy it established.  But Duke’s rescission  \nmemo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo.  Ibid.   According to the Government, “It was not arbi-\ntrary and capricious for DHS to view deferred action and its \ncollateral benefits as importantly linked.”  Ibid.  Perhaps.  \nBut that response misses the point. The fact that there may \nbe a valid reason not to separate deferred action from ben-\nefits does not establish that DHS considered that option or \nthat such consideration was unnecessary. \n  The lead dissent acknowledges that forbearance and ben-\nefits are legally distinct and can be decoupled.  Post, at 21– \n22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J). It contends, however, that \nwe should not “dissect” agency action “piece by piece.”  Post,  \nat 21.  The dissent instead rests on the Attorney General’s\nlegal determination—which considered only benefits—“to \nsupply the ‘reasoned analysis’” to support rescission of both \n \nbenefits and forbearance.  Post, at 22 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U. S., at 42).  But State Farm teaches that when an  \nagency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the “alternative[s]” that are “within the ambit of \nthe existing [policy].”  Id., at 51.  Here forbearance was not \nsimply “within the ambit of the existing [policy],” it was the \ncenterpiece of the policy: DACA, after all, stands for “De-\nferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n111a (emphasis added).  But the rescission memorandum  \ncontains no discussion of forbearance or the option of retain-\ning forbearance without benefits.  Duke “entirely failed to \nconsider [that] important aspect of the problem.”  State \nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43.  \n  That omission alone renders Acting  Secretary Duke’s de-\ncision arbitrary and capricious.  But it is not the only defect.   \nDuke also failed to address whether there was “legitimate \nreliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  Smiley v. Citibank  \n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996).  When  an \nagency changes course, as DHS did here, it must “be cogni-\nzant that longstanding policies may have ‘engendered seri-\nous reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” \n \nEncino Motorcars, LLC  v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) \n \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n(slip op., at 9) (quoting Fox Television, 556 U. S., at 515).  “It \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”   \nId., at 515.  Yet that is what the Duke Memorandum did. \n  For its part, the Government does not contend that Duke \nconsidered potential reliance interests; it counters that she \ndid not need to.  In the Government’s view, shared by the \nlead dissent, DACA recipients have no “legally cognizable \nreliance interests” because the DACA Memorandum stated  \nthat the program “conferred no substantive rights” and pro-\nvided benefits only in two-year increments. Reply Brief 16–\n17; App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a. See also post, at 23–24 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J). But neither the Government nor the lead  \ndissent cites any legal authority establishing that such fea-\ntures automatically preclude reliance interests, and we are \nnot aware of any. These disclaimers are surely pertinent in \nconsidering the strength of any reliance interests, but that\nconsideration must be undertaken by the agency in the first \ninstance, subject to normal APA review.  There was no such  \nconsideration in the Duke Memorandum. \n  Respondents and their amici assert that there was much \nfor DHS to consider.  They stress that, since 2012, DACA\nrecipients have “enrolled in degree programs, embarked on \ncareers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even  \nmarried and had children, all in reliance” on the DACA pro-\ngram.  Brief for Respondent Regents of Univ. of California \net al. in No. 18–587, p.  41 (Brief for Regents).  The conse-\nquences of the rescission, respondents emphasize, would \n“radiate outward” to DACA recipients’ families, including \ntheir 200,000 U. S.-citizen children, to the schools where \nDACA recipients study and teach, and to the employers who\nhave invested time and money in training them. See id., at \n41–42; Brief for Respondent State of New York et al. in No. \n18–589, p. 42 (Brief for New York).  See also Brief for 143 \nBusinesses as Amici Curiae 17 (estimating that hiring and\ntraining replacements would cost employers $6.3 billion).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIn addition, excluding DACA recipients from the lawful la-\nbor force may, they tell us, result in the loss of $215 billion \nin economic activity and an associated $60 billion in federal \ntax revenue over the next ten years.  Brief for Regents 6.  \nMeanwhile, States and local governments could lose $1.25 \nbillion in tax revenue each year.  Ibid.  \n  These are certainly noteworthy concerns, but they are not \nnecessarily dispositive.  To the Government and lead dis-\nsent’s point, DHS could respond that reliance on forbear-\nance and benefits was unjustified in light of the express lim-\nitations in the DACA Memorandum.  Or it might conclude \nthat reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful \nare entitled to no or diminished weight.  And, even if DHS \nultimately concludes that the reliance interests rank as se-\nrious, they are but one factor to consider.  DHS may deter-\nmine, in the particular context before it, that other interests \nand policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests.  Mak-\ning that difficult decision was the agency’s  job, but the \nagency failed to do it.\n  DHS has considerable flexibility in carrying out its re-\nsponsibility.  The wind-down here is a good example of the \nkind of options available.  Acting Secretary Duke author-\nized DHS to process two-year renewals for those DACA re-\ncipients  whose  benefits  were  set  to  expire  within  six \nmonths.  But Duke’s consideration was solely for the pur-\npose of assisting the agency in dealing with “administrative \ncomplexities.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a–118a.  She should \nhave considered whether she had similar flexibility in ad-\ndressing any reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nlead dissent contends that accommodating such interests \nwould be “another exercise of unlawful power,” post, at 23 \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the Government does not make\nthat argument and DHS has already extended benefits for \npurposes other than reliance, following consultation with \nthe Office of the Attorney General.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n116a. \n \n\n26   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Had Duke considered reliance interests, she might, for \nexample, have considered a broader renewal period based\non the need for DACA recipients to reorder their affairs.  Al-\nternatively, Duke might have considered more accommo-\ndating termination dates for recipients caught in the mid-\ndle of a time-bounded commitment, to allow them to, say, \ngraduate from their course of study, complete their military \nservice, or finish a medical treatment regimen.  Or she  \nmight have instructed immigration officials to give salient \nweight to any reliance interests engendered by DACA when \nexercising individualized enforcement discretion.\n  To be clear, DHS was not required to do any of this or to \n“consider all policy alternatives in reaching [its] decision.”  \nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.  Agencies are not compelled to\nexplore “every alternative device and thought conceivable \nby the mind of man.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, \n551 (1978).  But, because DHS was “not writing on a blank \nslate,” post, at 22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), it was re-\nquired to assess whether there were reliance interests, de-\ntermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.\n  The lead dissent sees all the foregoing differently.  In its \nview, DACA is illegal, so any actions under DACA are them-\nselves illegal.  Such actions, it argues, must cease immedi-\nately and the APA should not be construed to impede that \nresult.  See post, at 19–23 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  The dissent is correct that DACA was rescinded because \nof  the  Attorney  General’s  illegality  determination.    See  \nante, at 20.  But nothing about that determination fore-\nclosed or even addressed the options of retaining forbear-\nance or accommodating particular reliance interests.  Act-\ning Secretary Duke should have considered those matters \nbut did not.  That failure was arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  27  \n \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nIV \n  Lastly, we turn to respondents’ claim that the rescis-\nsion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n  The parties dispute the proper framing of this claim.  The  \nGovernment contends that the allegation that the Execu-\ntive, motivated by animus, ended a program that dispropor-\ntionately benefits certain ethnic groups is a selective en-\nforcement claim.  Such a claim, the Government asserts,  \nis barred by our decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee.  See 525 U. S., at 488 (holding \nthat “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitu-\ntional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation”).  Respondents counter that their \nclaim falls outside the scope of that precedent because they \nare not challenging individual enforcement proceedings.  \nWe need not resolve this debate because, even if the claim \nis cognizable, the allegations here are insufficient. \n  To plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible infer-\nence that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a moti-\nvating factor” in the relevant decision.  Arlington Heights v.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, \n266 (1977). Possible evidence includes disparate impact on \na particular group, “[d]epartures from the normal proce-\ndural sequence,” and “contemporary statements by mem-\nbers of the decisionmaking body.”  Id., at 266–268.  Track-\ning  these  factors,  respondents  allege  that  animus  is\nevidenced by (1) the disparate impact of the rescission on \nLatinos from Mexico, who represent 78% of DACA recipi-\nents; (2) the unusual history behind the rescission; and \n(3) pre- and post-election statements by President Trump.  \nBrief for New York 54–55. \n  None of these points, either singly or in concert, estab-\nlishes a plausible equal protection claim.  First, because \nLatinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien\npopulation, one would expect them to make up an outsized \n \n\n28   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nshare of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief  \nprogram. See B. Baker, DHS, Office of Immigration Statis-\ntics,  Population  Estimates,  Illegal  Alien  Population \nResiding in the United States: January 2015, Table 2 (Dec. \n2018),  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\n18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf.  Were this fact suffi-\ncient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable im-\nmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection \ngrounds. \n  Second, there is nothing irregular about the history lead-\ning up to the September 2017 rescission.  The lower courts  \nconcluded that “DACA received reaffirmation by [DHS] as \nrecently as three months before the rescission,” 908 F. 3d, \nat 519 (quoting 298 F. Supp. 3d, at 1315), referring to the \nJune 2017 DAPA rescission memo, which stated that DACA \nwould “remain in effect,” App. 870.  But this reasoning con-\nfuses abstention with reaffirmation.  The DAPA memo did \nnot address the merits of the DACA policy or its legality.  \nThus, when the Attorney General later determined that \nDACA  shared  DAPA’s  legal  defects,  DHS’s  decision  to  \nreevaluate DACA was not a “strange about-face.”  908 F. 3d,  \nat 519.  It was a natural response to a newly identified \nproblem.\n  Finally, the cited statements are unilluminating.  The  \nrelevant actors were most directly Acting Secretary Duke \nand the Attorney General.  As the Batalla Vidal court  \nacknowledged, respondents did not “identif[y] statements\nby [either] that would give rise to an inference of discrimi-\nnatory motive.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 278. Instead, respond-\nents contend that President Trump made critical state-\nments  about  Latinos  that  evince  discriminatory  intent.  \nBut,  even  as  interpreted  by  respondents,  these  state-\nments—remote in time and made in unrelated contexts— \ndo not qualify as “contemporary statements” probative of \nthe decision at issue.  Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 268.   \nThus, like respondents’ other points, the statements fail to \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nraise a plausible inference that the rescission was moti-\nvated by animus. \n*  *  * \n  We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are \nsound policies.  “The wisdom” of those decisions “is none of \nour concern.”  Chenery  II, 332 U. S., at 207.  We address \nonly whether the agency complied with the procedural re-\nquirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its ac-\ntion. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous is-\nsues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything \nto do about the hardship to DACA recipients.  That dual  \nfailure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated \nthe scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a \nreasonable manner.  The appropriate recourse is therefore \nto remand to DHS so that it may consider the problem  \nanew. \n  The judgment in NAACP, No. 18–588, is affirmed.7  The  \njudgment in Regents, No. 18–587, is vacated in part and re-\nversed in part.  And in Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589, the Feb-\nruary 13, 2018 order granting respondents’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction is vacated, the November 9, 2017 or-\nder partially denying the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis affirmed in part, and the March  29, 2018 order partially \ndenying the balance of the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis reversed in part. All three cases are remanded for further  \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n—————— \n7Our affirmance of the  NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it \n \nunnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope of the in-\njunctions issued by the District Courts in  Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \n  The majority rightly holds that the Department of Home-\nland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri-\nvals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any chal-\nlenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  \nI believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing \nrecord and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would \ninstead permit respondents to develop their equal protec-\ntion claims on remand. \n  Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in  a \npreliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at \nthis stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that \nwould “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that \n[a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,  678 (2009).  The three courts to eval-\nuate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared \nthis modest threshold.  908 F. 3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) \n(affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018). \n  I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on re-\nmand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts \nthat plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality \ndisagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either sin-\ngly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection \nclaim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by dis-\ncounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly view-\ning the rest.\n  First, the plurality dismisses the statements that Presi-\ndent Trump made both  before and after he assumed office.  \nThe  Batalla  Vidal  complaints  catalog  then-candidate \nTrump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people \nthat have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, \ndrug dealers, [and] rapists.” 291 F.  Supp. 3d, at 276 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints ad-\n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nditionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement compar-\ning undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for \n“the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling \nand trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 \n(ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nplurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote \nin time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  \nAnte, at 28.  \n  But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered \napproach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements \nas remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Ha-\nwaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements \narise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migra-\ntion from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s cam-\npaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, ac-\ncording to respondents, were an animating force behind the \nrescission of DACA. Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proc-\nlamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred \nentry of individuals from several Muslim-majority coun-\ntries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign state-\nments about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the \nPresident” help to “create the strong perception” that the \nrescission  decision  was  “contaminated  by  impermissible \ndiscriminatory  animus.”  585  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of  \nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides\nrespondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection \nclaims further. \n  Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate im-\npact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering \nthis point in isolation. Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient \nto state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immi-\ngration  policy  could  be  challenged  on  equal  protection\ngrounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be \nviewed in the context of the President’s public statements \non and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nstage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an \nexecutive decision disproportionately harms the same ra-\ncial group that the President branded as less desirable mere \nmonths earlier. \n  Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “spe-\ncific sequence of events leading up to the challenged deci-\nsion.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late  \nas  June  2017,  DHS  insisted  it  remained  committed  to \nDACA, even while rescinding a related program, the De-\nferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Perma-\nnent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months  \nlater,  DHS  terminated  DACA  without,  as  the  plurality \nacknowledges, considering important aspects of the termi-\nnation.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests \nthat something other than questions about the legality of \nDACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it \nraises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the \ndecision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Depart-\nment of Commerce  v.  New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) \n(slip op., at 26).

OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Between 2001 and 2011, Congress considered over two \ndozen bills that would have granted lawful status to mil-\nlions of aliens who were illegally brought to this country as \nchildren.  Each of those legislative efforts failed.  In the \nwake of this impasse, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (DHS) under President Barack Obama took matters  \ninto its own hands.  Without any purported delegation of \nauthority from Congress and without undertaking a rule-\nmaking, DHS unilaterally created a program known as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  The three-\npage DACA memorandum made it possible for approxi-\nmately 1.7 million illegal aliens to qualify for temporary \nlawful  presence  and  certain  federal  and  state  benefits.  \nWhen President Donald Trump took office in  2017, his Act-\ning Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through yet an-\nother memorandum, rescinded the DACA memorandum.  \nTo state it plainly, the Trump administration rescinded \nDACA the same way that the Obama administration cre-\nated it: unilaterally, and through a mere memorandum. \n  Today the majority makes the mystifying determination \nthat this rescission of DACA was unlawful.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the majority acts as though it is engaging \nin the routine application of standard principles of admin-\nistrative law. On the contrary, this is anything but a stand-\nard administrative law case. \n  DHS created DACA during the Obama administration \nwithout  any  statutory  authorization  and  without  going \nthrough the requisite rulemaking process.  As a result, the  \nprogram was unlawful from its inception.  The majority \ndoes not even attempt to explain why a court has the au-\nthority to scrutinize an agency’s policy reasons for rescind-\ning an unlawful program under the arbitrary and capri-\ncious microscope. The decision to countermand an unlawful \nagency action is clearly reasonable.  So long as the agency’s \ndetermination of illegality is sound, our review should be at \nan end. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an ef-\nfort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct \ndecision. The Court could have made clear that the solution  \nrespondents seek must come from the Legislative Branch.  \nInstead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS’ initial \noverreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.  In \ndoing so, it has given the green light for future political bat-\ntles to be fought in this Court rather than where they right-\nfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes \nthe Court’s duty to apply the law according to neutral prin-\nciples, and the ripple effects of the majority’s error will be \nfelt throughout our system of self-government. \n  Perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority’s holding \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing ad-\nministrations.  Under the auspices of today’s decision, ad-\nministrations  can  bind  their  successors  by  unlawfully \nadopting  significant  legal  changes  through  Executive \nBranch agency memoranda.  Even if the agency lacked au-\nthority to effectuate the changes, the changes cannot be un-\ndone by the same agency in a successor administration un-\nless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications to \nthe satisfaction of this Court.  In other words, the majority \nerroneously holds that the agency is not only permitted, but \nrequired,  to  continue  administering  unlawful  programs \nthat it inherited from a previous administration.

This 2014 memorandum expanded\nDACA eligibility by extending the deferred-action period to \nthree years and by relaxing other criteria.  It also imple-\nmented a related program, known as Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  DAPA allowed unlawfully present parents to ob-\ntain deferred action derivatively through their children who \nwere either citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Ap-\nproximately 4.3 million aliens qualified for DAPA and, as \nwith DACA, these individuals would have become eligible \nfor certain federal and state benefits upon the approval of \ntheir DAPA applications.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF. 3d 134, 181 (CA5 2015).  Nevertheless, the 2014 memo-\nrandum repeated the incongruous assertion that these pro-\ngrams “d[id] not confer any form of legal status in this coun-\ntry” and added that deferred action “may be terminated at \nany time at the agency’s discretion.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. \nin No. 18–587, at 104a. \nB \n  Twenty-six States filed suit to enjoin the implementation \nof  these  new  programs,  DAPA  and  “expanded  DACA,” \nmaintaining that they violated the Constitution, the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA).  The States contended that, \nbecause the 2014 memorandum allowed aliens to receive \ndeferred action and other benefits, it amounted to a legisla-\ntive rule that had to comply with the APA’s notice  and \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The States also argued that DHS’ de-\ncision to recategorize an entire class of aliens from “unlaw-\nfully present” to “lawfully present” exceeded its statutory \nauthority under the federal immigration laws.  According \nto the States, these defects rendered the 2014 memoran-\ndum arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.  \n  The District Court preliminarily enjoined DAPA and ex-\npanded DACA.  The Fifth Circuit  affirmed, rejecting DHS’ \nclaim that the programs were an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion.  Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 167, 188.  The court con-\ncluded that the States were likely to succeed on their claim \nthat the 2014 memorandum was a legislative rule that had \nto be adopted through notice and comment rulemaking.  Id., \nat 171–178.  The court further concluded that the 2014  \nmemorandum was “substantively contrary to law” because\nthe INA did not grant DHS the statutory authority to im-\nplement either program.  Id., at 170, 178–186. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 579 U. S. ___ \n(2016) (per curiam).  \nC \n  The 2014 memorandum was rescinded on June 15, 2017, \nbefore taking effect.  Shortly after that rescission, several \nof the plaintiff States sent a letter to then-Attorney General \nJefferson Sessions III. They contended that the 2012 DACA \nmemorandum was also legally defective because, “just like \nDAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for . . . lawful \npresence without any statutory authorization from Con-\ngress.” App. 873.  The States wrote that they would amend \ntheir complaint to challenge DACA if the administration \ndid not rescind the 2012 memorandum creating DACA by \nSeptember 5, 2017.\n  On September 4, then-Attorney General Sessions wrote \nto  then-Acting  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Elaine  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

Sessions stated that, \nin his legal opinion, DACA took effect “through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no es-\ntablished end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a simi-\nlar result.  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigra-\ntion laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by \nthe Executive Branch.”  Id., at 877.  The letter also stated \nthat DACA was infected with the “same legal . . . defects  \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA,” id., at  878, and thus \nDACA would likely be enjoined as well. \n  Then-Acting Secretary Duke  rescinded DACA the next \nday, also through a memorandum.  Her memorandum be-\ngan by noting that DACA “purported to use deferred action \n. . . to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress \nhad not otherwise acted to provide by law.” App. to Pet. for  \nCert. in No. 18–587, at 112a.  It described the history of the\nFifth Circuit litigation, noting that the court had concluded \nthat DAPA “conflicted with the discretion authorized by  \nCongress”  because  “the [INA] flatly does not permit the  \nreclassification  of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully pre-\nsent.”  Id., at 114a (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fi-\nnally, the memorandum accepted then-Attorney General \nSessions’ legal determination that DACA was unlawful for \nthe same reasons as DAPA.  See §1103(a)(1). In light of the\nlegal conclusions reached by the Fifth Circuit and the At-\ntorney General, then-Acting Secretary Duke set forth the \nprocedures for winding down DACA. \n  These three cases soon followed.  In each, respondents\nclaimed, among other things, that DACA’s rescission was \narbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  APA.    Two  District  \nCourts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while \nthe third vacated the rescission. \nII \n  “‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 290, 317 (2013) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quot-\ning Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355,  \n374 (1986)).  When an  agency exercises power beyond the\nbounds of its authority, it acts unlawfully.  See, e.g., SAS  \nInstitute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___, ___, n. (2018) (slip op., \nat 11, n.).  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA provides \na poignant illustration of ultra vires agency action.\n  DACA alters how the immigration laws apply to a certain \nclass of aliens.  “DACA [recipients] primarily entered the \ncountry either by overstaying a visa or by entering without \ninspection, and the INA instructs that aliens in both classes \nare removable.”  Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662, 713 (SD Tex. 2018) (footnote omitted).  But DACA \ngranted its recipients deferred action, i.e., a decision to “de-\ncline  to  institute  [removal]  proceedings,  terminate  [re-\nmoval] proceedings, or decline to institute a final order of \n[removal].”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  \nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Under other regulations, recipients of deferred \naction are deemed lawfully present for purposes of certain \nfederal benefits. See supra, at 4. Thus, DACA in effect cre-\nated a new exception to the statutory provisions governing \nremovability and, in the process, conferred lawful presence \non an entire class of aliens.  \n  To  lawfully  implement  such  changes,  DHS  needed  a \ngrant of authority from Congress to either reclassify remov-\nable DACA recipients as lawfully present, or to exempt the \nentire class of aliens covered by DACA from statutory re-\nmoval procedures. No party disputes that the immigration \nstatutes lack an express delegation to accomplish either re-\nsult.  And, an examination of the highly reticulated immi-\ngration regime makes clear that DHS has no implicit dis-\ncretion to create new classes of lawful presence or to grant \nrelief from  removal out of whole cloth.  Accordingly, DACA  \nis substantively unlawful. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  This conclusion should begin and  end our review.  The  \ndecision to rescind an unlawful agency action is per se law-\nful. No additional policy justifications or considerations are  \nnecessary.  And, the majority’s contrary holding—that an \nagency is not only permitted, but required, to continue an  \nultra vires action—has no basis in  law. \nA \n  Congress has not authorized DHS to reclassify an entire \nclass of removable aliens as lawfully present or to categori-\ncally exempt aliens from statutory removal provisions.  \n1 \n  I begin with lawful presence.  As just stated, nothing in \nthe federal immigration laws expressly delegates to DHS\nthe unfettered discretion to create new categories of law-\nfully present aliens.  And, there is no basis for concluding \nthat Congress implicitly delegated to DHS the power to re-\nclassify categories of aliens as lawfully present.  The immi-\ngration statutes provide numerous ways to obtain lawful \npresence, both temporary and permanent.  The highly de-\ntailed nature of these provisions indicates that Congress \nhas exhaustively provided for all of  the ways that it thought \nlawful presence should be obtainable, leaving no discretion \nto DHS to add new pathways. \n  For example, federal immigration laws provide over 60\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa options, including visas for \nambassadors, full-time students and their spouses and chil-\ndren, those engaged to marry a United States citizen within \n90 days of arrival, athletes and performers, and aliens with \nspecialized  knowledge  related  to  their  employers.    See  \n§§1101(a)(15)(A)–(V), 1184; 8 CFR §214.1; see also Congres-\nsional Research Service, J. Wilson, Nonimmigrant and Im-\nmigrant Visa Categories: Data Brief 1–6 (2019) (Table 1).  \nIn addition, the statutes permit the Attorney General to \ngrant temporary “parole” into the  United States “for urgent \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

Refugees and asylees also may \nreceive lawful permanent residence under certain condi-\ntions, §1159; 8 CFR §§209.1, 209.2.4  As with  temporary  \nlawful presence,  each  avenue to lawful  permanent resi-\ndence status has its own set of rules and exceptions.5  \n  As the Fifth Circuit held in the DAPA litigation, a conclu-\nsion with which then-Attorney General Sessions agreed, \n“specific and detailed provisions[ of] the INA expressly and \n—————— \n4The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful perma-\n \nnent residence status.  See §1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) (two years for spouses to \ndemonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of \nprocuring an  alien’s admission as an immigrant”); §1186b (qualifying  \nbusiness entrepreneurs). \n5For instance, Congress has  carved out rules for aliens who served in \n \nthe Armed Forces, §§1438–1440, and alien spouses who have been sub-\nject to domestic abuse, §§1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In light of this elaborate statutory scheme, the lack of \nany similar provision for DACA recipients convincingly es-\ntablishes that Congress left DHS with no discretion to cre-\nate an additional class of aliens eligible for lawful presence.  \nCongress knows well how to provide broad discretion, and\nit has provided open-ended delegations of authority in stat-\nutes too numerous to name.  But when it comes to lawful \npresence, Congress did something strikingly different.  In-\nstead of enacting  a statute with “broad general directives” \nand leaving it to the agency to fill in the lion’s share of the \ndetails,  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.  S.  361,  372 \n(1989), Congress put in place intricate specifications gov-\nerning eligibility for lawful presence.  This comprehensive \nscheme indicates that DHS has no discretion to supplement \nor amend the statutory provisions in any manner, least of \nall by memorandum.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (An agency “may not \nexercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with \nthe administrative structure that Congress enacted” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); see also ETSI Pipeline Pro-\nject v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 509–510 (1988). \n2 \n  The relief that Congress has extended to removable al-\niens likewise confirms that DACA exceeds DHS’ delegated \nauthority.  Through deferred action, DACA grants tempo-\nrary relief to removable aliens on a programmatic scale.  \nSee Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d, at 714.  But as with lawful pres-\nence, Congress did not expressly grant DHS the authority \nto create categorical exceptions to the statute’s removal re-\nquirements.  And again, as with lawful presence, the intri-\ncate level of detail in the federal immigration laws regard-\ning  relief  from  removal  indicates  that  DHS  has  no  \ndiscretionary authority to supplement that relief with an  \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nentirely new programmatic exemption.\n  At the outset, Congress clearly knows how to provide for \nclasswide deferred action when it wishes to do so.  On mul-\ntiple  occasions,  Congress  has  used  express  language  to \nmake certain classes of individuals eligible for deferred ac-\ntion. See 8 U. S. C. §§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (certain indi-\nviduals covered under the Violence Against Women Act are \n“eligible for deferred action”); Victims of Trafficking and Vi-\nolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522 (“‘Any individ-\n \nual described in subclause (I) is  eligible for deferred ac-\ntion’”); Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Ter-\nrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, §423(b), 115 Stat. \n361 (“Such  spouse, child, son, or daughter may be eligible \nfor deferred action”); National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, §§1703(c)(1)(A), (2), 117 Stat. 1694–\n1695 (“Such spouse or child shall be eligible for deferred ac-\ntion”).6  Congress has failed to provide similar explicit pro-\nvisions for DACA recipients, and the immigration laws con-\ntain no indication that DHS can, at will, create its own \ncategorical policies for deferred action. \n  Other provisions pertaining to relief from removal fur-\nther demonstrate that DHS lacked the delegated authority  \n—————— \n6In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action pro-\n \ngrams have been implemented by the Executive Branch without explicit \nlegislation.  But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive]  \n \npower.’ ” Medellín v.  Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 532 (2008) (quoting  Dames & \n \nMoore v.  Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981)).  If any of these programs had \nbeen challenged, it would seem that they would be legally infirm for the  \nsame reasons as DACA.  Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create \nnew categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ \ndeferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise.   Duncan v.  \nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, \nand Congress is no closer to a legislative solution than it was in 2012.   \nSee, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H.

For instance, both permanent and \ntemporary residents can seek cancellation of removal if  \nthey meet certain residency requirements and have not \ncommitted certain crimes.  §§1229b(a)–(b).  And certain \nnonpermanent residents may have their status adjusted to \npermanent  residence  during  these  proceedings.  \n§1229b(b)(2). Aliens can apply for asylum or withholding of \nremoval during removal proceedings unless they have com-\nmitted certain crimes.  §§1158, 1231(b)(3).  Applicants for \ncertain nonimmigrant visas may be granted a stay of re-\nmoval until the visa application is adjudicated.  §1227(d).  \nAnd, aliens may voluntarily depart rather than be subject\nto an order of removal. §1229c.\n  In sum, like lawful presence, Congress has provided for \nrelief from removal in specific and complex ways.  This nu-\nanced detail indicates that Congress has provided the full \npanoply of methods it thinks should be available for an al-\nien to seek relief from removal, leaving no discretion to DHS \nto provide additional programmatic forms of relief.7  \n3 \n  Finally, DHS could not appeal to general grants of au-\nthority, such as the Secretary’s ability to “perform such\nother acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his au-\nthority under the provisions of this chapter,” §1103(a)(3), or \nto “[e]stablis[h] national immigration enforcement policies\nand  priorities,”  6  U.

Even assuming that these ad hoc exer-\ncises of discretion are permissible, however, we  have stated that “[a]n \nagency confronting resource  constraints may change its own conduct, but \nit cannot change the law.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.

S. 561, 569 (1995), these grants of au-\nthority must be read alongside the express limits contained \nwithin the statute.  Basing the Secretary’s ability to com-\npletely overhaul immigration law on these general grants \nof  authority  would  eviscerate  that  deliberate  statutory \nscheme by “allow[ing the Secretary of DHS] to grant lawful  \npresence  . .  .  to  any  illegal  alien  in  the  United States.”  \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 184.  Not only is this “an untenable po-\nsition in light of the INA’s intricate system,” ibid., but it \nwould also render many of those provisions wholly super-\nfluous due to DHS’ authority to disregard them at will, \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  And in addi-\ntion to these fatal problems, adopting a broad interpreta-\ntion of these general grants of authority would run afoul of \nthe presumption that “Congress . . . does not alter the fun-\ndamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or \nancillary  provisions.”  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  \nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).  And it would also  \nconflict with the major questions doctrine, which is based \non the expectation that  Congress speaks clearly when it del-\negates the power to make “decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.

S.  302,  324  (2014)  (UARG)  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted); see also  Texas, 787 F. 3d, at 760–761. \n  Read together, the detailed statutory provisions govern-\ning temporary and lawful permanent resident status, relief \nfrom removal, and classwide deferred-action programs lead\nineluctably to the conclusion that DACA is “inconsisten[t] \nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.”  \nUniversity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, \n570 U. S. 338, 353 (2013).

United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 654 (SD Tex.  \n2015). The immigration statutes contain a level of granular \nspecificity that is exceedingly rare in the modern adminis-\ntrative state.  It defies all logic and common sense to con-\nclude that a statutory scheme detailed enough to provide \nconditional lawful presence to groups as narrowly defined\nas “alien entrepreneurs,” §1186b, is simultaneously capa-\ncious enough for DHS to grant lawful presence to almost \ntwo million  illegal aliens with the stroke of a Cabinet secre-\ntary’s pen. \nB \n  Then-Attorney General Sessions concluded that the ini-\ntial DACA program suffered from the “same legal . . . de-\nfects” as DAPA and expanded DACA, finding that, like \nthose programs, DACA was implemented without statutory\nauthority. App. 877–878. Not only was this determination \ncorrect, but it is also dispositive for purposes of our review.  \n“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power . . .  \nis limited to the authority granted by Congress.”  Bowen v.  \nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988).  DHS \nhad no authority here to create DACA, and the unlawful-\nness of that program is a sufficient justification for its re-\nscission.  \n  The majority opts for a different path, all but ignoring \nDACA’s substantive legal defect.  See ante, at 18–19.  On \nthe majority’s understanding of APA review, DHS was re-\nquired to provide additional policy justifications in order to \nrescind an action that it had no authority to take.  This rule \n“has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for [it] is \nconspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.”  Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 536 (2007) (ROBERTS, C.

No court can compel Executive Branch officials to ex-\nceed their congressionally delegated powers by continuing \na program that was void ab initio. Cf. Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U. S. 417 (1998); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919  \n(1983); see also EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., \n572 U. S. 489, 542, n. 5 (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Public \nCitizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 487 (1989) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  In reviewing agency\naction, our role is to ensure that Executive Branch officials  \ndo not transgress the proper bounds of their authority, Ar-\nlington, 569 U. S., at 327 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), not \nto perpetuate a decision to unlawfully wield power in direct \ncontravention  of  the enabling  statute’s  clear  limits,  see \nUARG, 573 U. S., at 327–328; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n  Under our precedents, DHS can only exercise the author-\nity that Congress has chosen to delegate to it.  See UARG, \n573 U. S., at 327.  In implementing DACA, DHS under the \nObama administration arrogated to itself power it was not \ngiven by Congress. Thus, every action taken by DHS under \nDACA is the unlawful exercise of power.  Now, under the  \nTrump administration, DHS has provided the most compel-\nling reason to rescind DACA: The program was unlawful \nand would force DHS to continue acting unlawfully if it car-\nried the program forward.  \nIII  \n  The majority’s demanding review of DHS’ decisionmak-\ning process is especially perverse given that the 2012 mem-\norandum flouted the APA’s procedural requirements—the\nvery  requirements  designed  to  prevent  arbitrary  deci-\nsionmaking. Even if DHS were authorized to create DACA,  \nit could not do so without undertaking an administrative \nrulemaking.  The fact that DHS did not engage in this pro-\ncess likely provides an independent basis for rescinding \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nDACA.  But at the very least, this procedural defect com-\npounds the absurdity of the majority’s position in these \ncases. \n  As described above, DACA fundamentally altered the im-\nmigration laws. It created a new category of aliens who, as \na class, became exempt from statutory removal procedures, \nand it gave those aliens temporary lawful presence.  Both \nchanges contravened statutory limits.  DACA is thus what  \nis commonly called a substantive or legislative rule.8  As the  \nname implies, our precedents state that legislative rules \nare those that “have the force and effect of law.”  Chrysler  \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Our  precedents  allow  the  vast  majority  of  legislative \nrules to proceed through so-called “informal” notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  See United States v. Florida East \nCoast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973).9 But under our \nprecedents, an agency must engage in certain procedures \nmandated by the APA before its rule carries legal force.  Ki-\nsor v. Wilkie, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (plurality opinion) \n(slip op., at 23) (“[A] legislative rule, . . . to be valid[,] must \ngo through notice and comment”); id., at ___ (GORSUCH, J.,  \nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 17) (same); Perez v. \nMortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.

These procedures specify that the \nagency “shall” publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in  \n—————— \n8The majority  tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must.  See ante, at \n \n11–12.  Otherwise, the majority would have to accept that DACA was \nnothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make \nits rescission  unreviewable.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831  \n(1985). \n9As I have previously pointed out, “the APA actually contemplated a  \n \nmuch more formal process  for most rulemaking.”   Perez v. Mortgage  \nBankers Assn., 575 U. S. 92, 128, n.  5 (2015) (opinion concurring in judg-\nment). \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. C. §§553(b)–(c); see also Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opin-\nion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17). As we have recognized\nrecently, use of the word “shall” indicates that these proce-\ndures impose mandatory obligations on the agency before it \ncan adopt a valid binding regulation.  See Maine Commu-\nnity Health Options v.  United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___  \n(2020) (slip op., at 12).  After undergoing notice and com-\nment, the agency then publishes the final rule, which must \n“articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the] action in-\ncluding a rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United  \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463  \nU. S.  29,  43  (1983)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  \nOnly after completing this process is the legislative rule a \nvalid law. See Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, \nJ.) (slip op., at 17).10  \n  Because DACA has the force and effect of law, DHS was  \nrequired to observe the procedures set out in the APA if it \nwanted to promulgate a legislative rule.  It is undisputed, \nhowever, that DHS did not do so.  It provided no oppor-\ntunity for interested parties to submit comments regarding \nthe effect that the program’s dramatic and very significant \nchange in immigration law would have on various aspects \nof society.  It provided no discussion of economic considera-\ntions or national security interests.  Nor did it provide any \nsubstantial policy justifications for treating young people \n—————— \n10The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment \n \nrulemaking.  For example, an agency may promulgate a legally binding \nrule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so.  5 U.  S. C.  \n§553(b)(B).  This text would become a nullity if the agency  could achieve \nthe same effect by simply dispensing with notice and comment proce-\ndures altogether. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

And, it did not invoke any law authorizing  \nDHS to create such a program beyond its inexplicable as-\nsertion that DACA  was consistent with existing law.  Be-\ncause DHS failed to engage in the statutorily mandated\nprocess, DACA never gained status as a legally binding reg-\nulation that could impose duties or obligations on third par-\nties.  See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 23);  id., \nat ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17).\n  Given this state of affairs, it is unclear to me why DHS \nneeded to provide any explanation whatsoever when it de-\ncided to rescind DACA.  Nothing in the APA suggests that \nDHS was required to spill any ink justifying the rescission\nof an invalid legislative rule, let alone that it was required \nto provide policy justifications beyond acknowledging that \nthe program was simply unlawful from the beginning.  And,  \nit is well established that we do not remand for an agency \nto correct its reasoning when it was required by law to take \nor abstain from an action.  See Morgan Stanley Capital \nGroup Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 \nU. S. 527, 544–545 (2008).  Here, remand would be futile,  \nbecause no amount of policy explanation could cure the fact \nthat DHS lacked statutory authority to enact DACA in the \nfirst place.\n  Instead of recognizing this, the majority now requires the \nrescinding Department to treat the invalid rule as though \nit were legitimate.  As just explained, such a requirement \nis not supported by the APA.11  It is also absurd, as evi-\ndenced by its application to DACA in these cases.  The ma-\njority insists that DHS was obligated to discuss its choices \nregarding benefits and forbearance in great detail, even \n—————— \n11Thus, it is not  that the APA “should  not” be construed to support the \n \nmajority’s result, ante, at 26 (emphasis added), it is that the APA does  \nnot and cannot support that result. \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nthough no such detailed discussion accompanied DACA’s is-\nsuance. And, the majority also requires DHS to discuss re-\nliance interests at length, even though deferred action tra-\nditionally does not take reliance interests into account and \nDHS was not forced to explain its treatment of reliance in-\nterests in the first instance by going through notice and \ncomment.  See infra, at 23–24.  The majority’s demand for\nsuch an explanation here simply makes little sense. \n  At bottom, of course, none of this matters, because DHS  \ndid provide a sufficient explanation for its action.  DHS’ \nstatement that DACA was ultra vires  was more than suffi-\ncient to justify its rescission.12  By requiring more, the ma-\njority has distorted the APA review process beyond recogni-\ntion,  further  burdening  all  future  attempts  to  rescind \nunlawful programs.  Plaintiffs frequently bring successful \nchallenges to agency actions by arguing that the agency has \nimpermissibly dressed up a legislative rule as a policy state-\nment and must comply with the relevant procedures before \nfunctionally binding regulated parties.  See, e.g., Mendoza  \nv. Perez, 754 F. 3d 1002 (CADC 2014); Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 643 F. 3d 311 (CADC 2011); Na-\ntional Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn., Inc.  \nv. Sullivan, 979 F. 2d 227 (CADC 1992).  But going forward, \nwhen a rescinding agency inherits an invalid legislative\nrule that ignored virtually every rulemaking requirement \nof the APA, it will be obliged to overlook that reality.  In-\nstead of simply terminating the program because it did not \ngo through the requisite process, the agency will be com-\npelled to treat an invalid legislative rule as though it were \nlegitimate.13  \n—————— \n12I express no view on what other reasons would justify  an agency’s  \n \ndecision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action.  I merely point out \nthat correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n13In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immi-\n \ngration laws and had complied with the APA, it would still violate the \nConstitution as an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  See  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nIV \n  Even  if  I  were  to  accept  the  majority’s  premise  that \nDACA’s rescission required additional policy justifications, \nthe majority’s reasons for setting aside the agency’s deci-\nsion still fail. \nA \n  First, the majority claims that the Fifth Circuit discussed \nonly the legality of the 2014 memorandum’s conferral of \nbenefits, not its “forbearance component”—i.e., the decision \nnot to place DACA recipients into removal proceedings.  \nAnte, at 20.  The majority, therefore, claims that, notwith-\nstanding  the  then-Attorney  General’s  legal  conclusion, \nthen-Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider re-\nvoking  DACA  recipients’  lawful  presence  and  other  at-\ntendant benefits while continuing to defer their removal.  \nAnte, at 22–23. Even assuming the majority correctly char-\nacterizes the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, it cites no authority for \nthe proposition that arbitrary and capricious review re-\nquires an agency to dissect an unlawful program piece by \npiece,  scrutinizing  each  separate  element  to  determine \nwhether it would independently violate the law, rather \nthan just to rescind the entire program.14  \n—————— \nDepartment of Transportation v.  Association of American Railroads, 575  \nU. S. 43, 77 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).  Putting aside \nthis constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment process at \nleast attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some \nof the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rule-\nmaking process.  Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51  \nAdmin. L. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n14The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly \n \nquestionable.  Because a grant of deferred action renders DACA recipi-\nents eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from \nclear that the Department could separate  DACA’s “forbearance compo-\nnent” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet an-\nother APA problem.  The majority points to the fact that, under the Pa-\ntient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, relevant regulations \nexclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage.  \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  The then-Attorney General reviewed the thorough deci-\nsions of the District Court and the Fifth Circuit.  Those \ncourts exhaustively examined the INA’s text and structure, \nthe relevant provisions of other federal immigration stat-\nutes, the historical practice of deferred action, and the gen-\neral grants of statutory authority to set immigration policy.  \nBoth decisions concluded that  DAPA and expanded DACA \nviolated the carefully crafted federal immigration scheme, \nthat such violations could not be justified through reference \nto past exercises of deferred action, and that the general \ngrants of statutory authority did not give DHS the power to \nenact such a sweeping nonenforcement program. Based on  \nthe reasoning of those decisions, then-Attorney General \nSessions concluded that DACA was likewise implemented \nwithout statutory authority.  He directed DHS to restore \nthe rule of law.  DHS followed the then-Attorney General’s \nlegal analysis and rescinded the program.  This legal con-\nclusion more than suffices to supply the “reasoned analysis” \nnecessary to rescind an unlawful program. State Farm, 463  \nU. S., at 42.  \n  The majority has no answer except to suggest that this \napproach is inconsistent with  State Farm.  See ante, at 21– \n22.  But in doing so, the majority ignores the fact that, un-\nlike the typical “prior policy” contemplated by the Court in  \n—————— \nAnte, at 19, n. 5.  But that misses the point.  Those regulations were \npromulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the DACA pro-\ncess applie[d]” for those benefits.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012).  By \ncontrast, DACA recipients have been eligible for and have received Med-\nicare, Social Security, and work authorization for  years.  DHS therefore \nis not writing on a blank slate.  Under the majority’s rule, DHS would  \nneed to amend all relevant regulations and explain why all recipients of\ndeferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer \nreceive them.  Alternatively and perhaps  more problematically, it would \nneed to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred action should  \ncontinue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not.  It thus seems  \nhighly likely that the majority’s proposed course of action would be sub-\nject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nState Farm, DACA is unlawful.  Neither State Farm nor \nany other decision cited by the majority addresses what an \nagency must do when it has inherited an unlawful program.  \nIt is perhaps for this reason that, rather than responding \nwith authority of its own, the majority simply opts to excise \nthe “unlawful policy” aspect from its discussion. \nB \n  Second, the majority claims that DHS erred by failing to \ntake into account the reliance interests of DACA recipients.   \nAnte, at 23–26.  But reliance interests are irrelevant when  \nassessing whether to rescind an action that the agency \nlacked statutory authority to take.  No amount of reliance \ncould ever justify continuing a program that allows DHS to \nwield power that neither Congress nor the Constitution \ngave it. Any such decision would be “not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U. S. C. \n§§706(2)(A), (C). Accordingly, DHS would simply be engag-\ning in yet another exercise of unlawful power if it used reli-\nance interests to justify continuing the initially unlawful \nprogram, and a court would be obligated to set aside that \naction.15  \n  Even if reliance interests were sometimes relevant when \nrescinding an ultra vires action, the rescission still would \nnot be arbitrary and capricious here.  Rather, as the major-\nity does not dispute, the rescission is consistent with how\ndeferred action has always worked.  As a general matter, \ndeferred action creates no rights—it exists at the Govern-\nment’s discretion and can be revoked at any time.  See App.  \n—————— \n15The majority contends that this argument does not carry force be-\n \ncause the rescission implemented a winddown period during which re-\ncipients would continue to receive benefits.  But whether DHS’ decision \nto wind down DACA was lawful is a separate question from whether \nDHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing an \nunlawful program. \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The Government has made clear time \nand again that, because “deferred action is not an immigra-\ntion status, no alien has the right to deferred action.

Thus, con-\ntrary to the majority’s unsupported assertion,  ante, at 23,  \nthis longstanding administrative treatment of deferred ac-\ntion provides strong evidence and authority for the proposi-\ntion that an agency need not consider reliance interests in\nthis context.16  \n  Finally, it is inconceivable to require DHS to study reli-\nance interests before rescinding DACA considering how the \nprogram was previously defended.  DHS has made clear \nsince DACA’s inception that it would not consider such re-\nliance interests.  Contemporaneous with the DACA memo, \nDHS stated that “DHS can terminate or renew deferred ac-\ntion at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  Consideration  \n—————— \n16The majority’s  approach will make it far  more difficult to change \n \ndeferred-action programs going forward, which is hardly in keeping with \nthis Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in  \nadministrative discretion” used for administrative “convenience.”  Reno  \nv.

In fact,  \nDHS repeatedly argued in court that the 2014 memoran-\ndum was a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion in part \nbecause deferred action created no rights on which recipi-\nents could rely.  Before the Fifth Circuit, DHS stated that  \n“DHS may revoke or terminate deferred action and begin \nremoval proceedings at any time at its discretion.”  Brief for  \nAppellants in Texas v.  United States, No. 15–40238, p. 7;  \nsee also id., at 45–46.

T. 2015, No. 15–674, p. 5; see also id., at 37.

Without grounding its position in  \neither the APA or precedent, the majority declares that \nDHS was required to overlook  DACA’s obvious legal defi-\nciencies and provide additional policy reasons and justifica-\ntions before restoring the rule of law.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of ALITO,  J. \nnow  plays  in  our  constitutional system  should  consider\nwhat has happened in these cases.  Early in the term of the\ncurrent President, his administration took the controver-\nsial step of attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Shortly thereafter, \none of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked \nthis rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in \nlitigation.  In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed \npetitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not \nresolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells \nthe Department of Homeland Security to go back and try \nagain. What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, with-\nout holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented \nthat from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  \nOur constitutional system is not supposed to work that way. \n  I join JUSTICE THOMAS’s opinion.   DACA presents a deli-\ncate political issue, but that is not our business. As JUSTICE \nTHOMAS explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and \nthat alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even  \nif DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for over-\nturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA repre-\nsented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its re-\nscission represented an exercise of that same discretion, \nand it would therefore be unreviewable under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the ex-\ntent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and \ncapricious for essentially the reasons explained by JUSTICE \nKAVANAUGH.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \n  For the last 20 years, the country has engaged in conse-\nquential policy, religious, and moral debates about the legal \nstatus of millions of young immigrants who, as children, \nwere brought to the United States and have lived here ever \nsince.  Those young immigrants do not have legal status in \nthe United States under current statutory law.  They live, \ngo to school, and work here with uncertainty about their \nfutures.  Despite many attempts over the last two decades, \nCongress has not yet enacted legislation to afford legal sta-\ntus to those immigrants. \n  In 2012, exercising its view of the Executive’s prosecuto-\nrial discretion under Article II and the immigration laws, \nPresident Obama’s administration unilaterally instituted a \nprogram known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nor DACA.  Under DACA, eligible young immigrants may \napply for and receive deferred action.  They must renew \ntheir DACA status every two years.  Under the program, \nthe Executive Branch broadly forbears from enforcing cer-\ntain immigration removal laws against DACA recipients.  \nAnd by virtue of the forbearance, DACA recipients also be-\ncome eligible for work authorization and other benefits. \n  Since  2017,  President  Trump’s  administration  has \nsought to rescind DACA based on its different and narrower \nunderstanding of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion \nunder Article II and the immigration laws.  In its view, the \nExecutive Branch legally may not, and as a policy matter \nshould not, unilaterally forbear from enforcing the immi-\ngration laws against such a large class of individuals.  The \ncurrent administration has stated that it instead wants to \nwork with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that \nwould address the legal status of those immigrants together \nwith other significant immigration issues. \n  The question before the Court is whether the Executive \nBranch acted lawfully in ordering rescission of the ongoing \nDACA program.  To begin with, all nine Members of the \nCourt accept, as do the DACA plaintiffs themselves, that \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nthe Executive Branch possesses the legal authority to re-\nscind DACA and to resume pre-DACA enforcement of the \nimmigration laws enacted by Congress.  Having previously \nadopted a policy of prosecutorial discretion and nonenforce-\nment with respect to a particular class of offenses or indi-\nviduals, the Executive Branch has the legal authority to re-\nscind such a policy and resume enforcing the law enacted \nby Congress.  The Executive Branch’s exercise of that re-\nscission authority is subject to constitutional constraints \nand may also be subject to statutory constraints.  The nar-\nrow legal dispute here concerns a statutory constraint—\nnamely, whether the Executive Branch’s action to rescind \nDACA satisfied the general arbitrary-and-capricious stand-\nard of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. \n  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  \nAs the Court has long stated, judicial review under that \nstandard is deferential to the agency.  The Court may not \nsubstitute its policy judgment for that of the agency.  The \nCourt simply ensures that the agency has acted within a \nbroad zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reason-\nably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  ex-\nplained the decision.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U. S. 502 (2009); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29 (1983). \n  The Executive Branch explained its decision to rescind \nDACA in two sequential memorandums by successive Sec-\nretaries of Homeland Security: the 2017 Duke Memoran-\ndum and the 2018 Nielsen Memorandum.  The Duke Mem-\norandum focused on DACA’s perceived legal flaws.  The \nCourt today finds the Duke Memorandum insufficient un-\nder the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  But regardless of whether the Court is correct about the \nDuke Memorandum, the Nielsen Memorandum more fully \nexplained the Department’s legal reasons for rescinding \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA, and clarified that even if DACA were lawful, the De-\npartment would still rescind DACA for a variety of policy \nreasons.    The  Nielsen  Memorandum  also  expressly  ad-\ndressed the reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nquestion under the APA’s deferential arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious standard is not whether we agree with the Depart-\nment’s decision to rescind DACA.  The question is whether \nthe Nielsen Memorandum reasonably explained the deci-\nsion to rescind DACA.  Under ordinary application of the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memoran-\ndum—with its alternative and independent rationales and \nits discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an expla-\nnation for the Executive Branch’s action. \n  The Nielsen Memorandum was issued nine months after \nthe Duke Memorandum.  Under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, the Nielsen Memorandum is itself a “rule” setting \nforth “an agency statement of general . . . applicability and \nfuture effect designed to implement . . . policy.”  5 U. S. C. \n§551(4).  Because it is a rule, the Nielsen Memorandum con-\nstitutes “agency action.”  §551(13).  As the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Nielsen had the authority to \ndecide whether to stick with Secretary Duke’s decision to \nrescind DACA, or to make a different decision.  Like Secre-\ntary Duke, Secretary Nielsen chose to rescind DACA, and \nshe provided additional explanation.  Her memorandum \nwas akin to common forms of agency action that follow ear-\nlier agency action on the same subject—for example, a sup-\nplemental or new agency statement of policy, or an agency \norder with respect to a motion for rehearing or reconsider-\nation.  Courts often consider an agency’s additional expla-\nnations of policy or additional explanations made, for exam-\nple, on agency rehearing or reconsideration, or on remand \nfrom a court, even if the agency’s bottom-line decision itself \ndoes not change. \n  Yet the Court today jettisons the Nielsen Memorandum \nby classifying it as a post hoc justification for rescinding \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA.  Ante, at 14–16.  Under our precedents, however, the \npost hoc justification doctrine merely requires that courts \nassess agency action based on the official explanations of \nthe agency decisionmakers, and not based on after-the-fact \nexplanations advanced by agency lawyers during litigation \n(or  by  judges).   See,  e.g.,  State  Farm, 463 U. S., at  50 \n(“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc ration-\nalizations for agency action”); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. \n380, 397 (1974) (same); NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n380 U. S. 438, 443–444 (1965) (same); Burlington Truck \nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) \n(same).  As the D. C. Circuit has explained, the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine “is not a time barrier which freezes an \nagency’s exercise of its judgment after an initial decision \nhas been made and bars it from further articulation of its \nreasoning.  It is a rule directed at reviewing courts which \nforbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of ra-\ntionales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  deci-\nsionmakers.”  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 6 \n(2006) (Garland, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Indeed, the ordinary judicial remedy for an agency’s in-\nsufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation \nby the relevant agency personnel.  It would make little \nsense for a court to exclude official explanations by agency \npersonnel such as a Cabinet Secretary simply because the \nexplanations are purportedly post hoc, and then to turn \naround and remand for further explanation by those same \nagency personnel.  Yet that is the upshot of the Court’s ap-\nplication of the post hoc justification doctrine today.  The \nCourt’s refusal to look at the Nielsen Memorandum seems \nparticularly  mistaken,  moreover,  because  the  Nielsen \nMemorandum shows that the Department, back in 2018, \nconsidered the policy issues that the Court today says the \nDepartment did not consider.  Ante, at 20–26. \n  To be sure, cases such as Overton Park and Camp v. Pitts \nsuggest that courts reviewing certain agency adjudications \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nmay in some circumstances decline to examine an after-the-\nfact agency explanation.  See Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, \n142–143 (1973) (per curiam); Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 419–421 (1971).  But \nagency adjudications are “concerned with the determina-\ntion of past and present rights and liabilities,” Attorney \nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 14 \n(1947), and implicate the due process interests of the indi-\nvidual parties to the adjudication.  Judicial review of an ad-\njudication therefore ordinarily focuses on what happened \nduring the agency’s adjudication process of deciding that in-\ndividual case. \n  Even if certain agency adjudications have a slightly more \nstringent restriction on post hoc explanations, the APA is \n“based upon a dichotomy between rule making and adjudi-\ncation,” ibid., and this case involves an ongoing agency rule \nthat has future effect—the rescission of DACA.  The Nielsen \nMemorandum implements and explains the rescission of \nDACA.  I am aware of no case from this Court, and the \nCourt today cites none, that has employed the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine to exclude an agency’s official explana-\ntion of an agency rule.  For purposes of arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious review, it does not matter whether the latest official \nexplanation was two years ago or three years ago.  What \nmatters is whether the explanation was reasonable and fol-\nlowed the requisite procedures.  In my view, the Court \nshould  consider  the  Nielsen  Memorandum  in  deciding \nwhether the Department’s rescission of DACA satisfies the \nAPA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  Because the Court excludes the Nielsen Memorandum, \nthe Court sends the case back to the Department of Home-\nland Security for further explanation.  Although I disagree \nwith the Court’s decision to remand, the only practical con-\nsequence of the Court’s decision to remand appears to be \nsome delay.  The Court’s decision seems to allow the De-\npartment on remand to relabel and reiterate the substance \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nof the Nielsen Memorandum, perhaps with some elabora-\ntion as suggested in the Court’s opinion.  Ante, at 23–26.*\n*    *    * \n  The Court’s resolution of this narrow APA issue of course \ncannot eliminate the broader uncertainty over the status of \nthe DACA recipients.  That uncertainty is a result of Con-\ngress’s inability thus far to agree on legislation, which in \nturn has forced successive administrations to improvise, \nthereby triggering many rounds of relentless litigation with \nthe prospect of more litigation to come.  In contrast to those \nnecessarily  short-lived  and  stopgap  administrative \nmeasures, the Article I legislative process could produce a \nsturdy and enduring solution to this issue, one way or the \nother, and thereby remove the uncertainty that has per-\nsisted for years for these young immigrants and the Na-\n—————— \n*Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s ar-\n \nbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not consider whether its prose-\ncutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” \nand therefore not subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the \nfirst place.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  Several judges have advanced argu-\nments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an \nexercise of forbearance authority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions \nabout whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial discretion \nagainst a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable \nunder the APA as “committed to agency discretion by law.”  Ibid.; see \nCasa De Maryland v.
