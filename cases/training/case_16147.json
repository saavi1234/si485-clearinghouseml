    "summary": "<p>On July 9, 2014, a lawfully-present alien authorized to work in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff sued Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance, Inc., under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, alleging discrimination based on alienage in the making of employment contracts. Represented by private counsel and MALDEF, he sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. Citing the defendant’s advertised practice of requiring new employees to have had three or more continuous years of U.S. residency, hold permanent visas, and read and write English fluently, the plaintiff alleged that the company unlawfully refused or rescinded employment contracts to individuals based on their status as non-citizens or permanent residents. The named plaintiff, who had applied for employment and interviewed with the defendant, alleged that after one of its employees learned of his status as a non-citizen without a green card, the company decided to decline him an employment contract because of his alienage status. </p><p>On September 4, 2014 the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint. After hearing oral arguments, Judge Katherine Forrest denied the motion to dismiss on November 11, 2014, holding that the plaintiff could successfully plead intentional discrimination by alleging that the defendant acted pursuant to a facially discriminatory policy. In this case, Judge Forrest found that the policy facially discriminated against lawfully present aliens without green cards, who, as lawfully present aliens, are protected by § 1981. 69 F.Supp.3d 364.</p><p>The defendants moved to appeal shortly after, and on December 20, 2014 Judge Forrest stayed the case pending the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s decision whether or not to accept the defendant’s interlocutory appeal. On March 17, 2015, the Second Circuit granted the defendants permission to appeal the District Court’s (non-final) denial of their motion to dismiss. </p><p>However, before appellate briefing, the parties settled, out-of-court. On May 20, 2015 the plaintiffs filed a stipulation for dismissal of the case with prejudice, with each party to pay their own fees and expenses. Although the details of the settlement are unclear, on August 19, 2015, MALDEF posted the following <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MALDEF/photos/a.479912060698.266123.18053840698/10153527413040699/\">on Facebook</a>, which appears to be related to the settlement in this case: \"As part of an amicable legal agreement, MALDEF and Northwestern Mutual have launched a new recruitment program aimed at immigrants authorized to work, without sponsorship, including those in the DACA program, interested in a financial representative internship or financial representative contract.\" According to the post, individuals may be eligible for up to $7,500 in awards if they were told on or after July 1, 2010 that they were ineligible for a financial representative internship or contract because of their work authorization or immigration classification. </p>",

(\"Defendant\" or \"Northwestern Mutual\" ):\nSUMMARY OF CLAIM\n1. Northwestern Mutual, the nation's largest direct provider ofindividual life\ninsurance, outright refuses to hire individuals based on their alienage status notwithstanding the\nfact that they are authorized to work in the United States. Specifically, Northwestern Mutual\ndenies individuals the right to work ifthey are non-U.S, citizens or U.S, permanent residents.\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 2 of 12\nThis company-wide policy and practice discriminates based on alienage and is unlawful under the\nCivil Rights Act of 1866,as codified by 42 U.S.C.) 1981.\nPARTIES\nPlaintiff Ruben Juarez\n2. Plaintiff Ruben Juarez is a 25-year-old Mexican national presently residing in\nYonkers, New York. On May 29, 2014, Mr. Juarez graduated summa curn laude from Lehman\nCollege, a liberal arts college within the City University ofNew York, with a Bachelor of\nScience in Accounting and a G.P.A. of3.83/4.0. Mr. Juarez was recently accepted to Fordham\nUniversity's School ofBusiness to earn a Master ofScience in Global Finance,\n3. Mr, Juarez has authorization to work in the U.S.through the Federal\nGovernment's immigration program for undocumented youth in the United States called\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\").\nDefendant\nThe Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, Inc. Milwaukee, WI (NM)\n(life and disability insurance, annuities) is a Wisconsin corporation using the marketing name\nNorthwestern Mutual.\n5. Noithwestern Mutual, by soliciting, conducting, and transacting business in New\nYork State, engages in continuous, permanent, and substantial activity within the state.\n6. Northwestern Mutual is not a federal enclave and therefore is subject to Plaintiff's\n42 U.S.C.) 1981claim.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.$ 1331.\n8. This Court is empowered to issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n$$ 2201 and 2202.\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 3 of 12\n9, Venue is proper in the Southern District ofNew York pursuant to 28 U.S.C, )\n1391(b)(2)because a substantial part ofthe events or omissions giving rise to the claims\noccurred in this district and Defendant conducts business within this district.\nBACKGROUND\n10. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\")provides\nForm I-9to employers within the United States to verify the identity and employment\nauthorization ofindividuals they wish to hire.\n11. Employers are responsible for completing and maintaining Form I-9 for all oftheir\nemployees, whether they are citizens or non-citizens.\n12. Both employees and employers must complete Form I-9. An employee must\nprovide the employer with acceptable documents confirming both his identity and employment\nauthorization. Acceptable documents for Form I-9 verification are listed on the form and include,\namong others, a Social Security Account number card and an Employment Authorization\nDocument (\"EAD\"). An EAD establishes both identity and employment authorization, no further\ndocumentation is necessary.\n13. \"Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they will accept from an\nemployee.\"'oreover, according to the Department ofHomeland Security (\"DHS\")—which\nregulates the USCIS —\"[i]tis illegal to discriminate against any work-authorized individual in\nhiring, discharge, recruitment or referral for a fee, or in the employment eligibility verification\n(Form I-9 and E-Verify) process based on that individual's citizenship status, immigration\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, U.S.CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES,\nOMB NO. 1615-0047,INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITYVERIFICATION at 1\n(emphasis in original) (2016),available at http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-\n9.pdf (last visited July 9,2014).\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 4 of 12\nstatus or national origin.\"&02 Furthermore, \"[t]herefusal to hire an individual because the\ndocumentation presented has a future expiration date may also constitute illegal\ndiscrimination.\"\n14. On June 15,2012, President Obama announced that DHS would no longer\nremove certain young immigrants under an executive order now known as DACA.\n15. DACA's purpose, as explained by President Obama, is to \"[stop] expel[ling]\n...\ntalented young people, who [have] been raised as Americans; understand themselves to be part\n...\nofthis country [and] who want to staff our labs, or start new businesses, or defend our\ncountry.\"\n16. DACA is a form of\"deferred action\", a discretionary grant ofauthorized stay by\nthe Federal Government. Deferred action granted through DACA is valid for two years and is\nsubject to renewal for an additional two years.\n17. DACA mandates that persons who are granted \"deferred action\" will be eligible\nto obtain an EAD, a federal work permit, and a Social Security number. In other words, those\ngranted \"deferred action\" and in possession ofan EAD are legally authorized to work in the\nUnited States.\n18. As ofFebruary 6, 2014, USCIS has approved over 500,000 requests for DACA.\n19. DACA recipients are not the only class ofimmigrants who have legal work\nauthorization, but may not meet Noithwestern Mutual's alienage requirements. Northwestern\nId.\nId.\nPresident Obama, Remarks by the President on Immigration (June 15,2012),available at\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-immigration (last\nvisited July 9,2014).\nUSCIS 2012-2014First Quarter Report, available at\nhttp: //www.uscis. gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigrati\non%20Forms%20Data/AI1%20Form%20Types/DACA/DACA-06-02-14.pdf (last visited July 9,\n2014),\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 5 of 12\nMutual's imposed condition for entering into a work contract also discriminates against\nindividuals who have been granted temporary residence, refugee, asylee, or fiance/e status and\nare legally authorized to work. Northwesterii Mutual's policy also discriminates against\nsurvivors ofsevere forms oftrafficking and serious criminal activity for whom Congress has\nprovided visas and work authorization.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n20. In September 2012, Mr. Juarez applied for, and on October 25, 2012, was\ngranted, DACA status. In and around the same date, Mr. Juarez also obtained an EAD.\n21. On November 2, 2012, Mr. Juarez was granted a Social Security number.\n22. On October 26, 2012, aNorthwestern Mutual recruiter, Zuleyma Stryker, visited\nLehman College's 13ronx campus to recruit college students to become interns. Mr. Juarez\nsubmitted his resume to Ms. Stryker,\n23. Approximately one year later, on October 6, 2013,another Northwestern Mutual\nrecruiter, Susan Lewadowski, invited Mr. Juarez to an information session at Northwestern\nMutual's offices in Stamford, Connecticut.\n24. On November 27, 2013,Mr, Juarez traveled to Northwestern Mutual's Stamford\noffice to attend an information session alongside approximately 50 other individuals.\n25. On December 11,2013,Mr. Juarez interviewed with Ms. Lewandowski who\nexpressed strong interest in hiring Mr. Juarez.\n26. After a very positive interview, Ms. Lewandowski asked Mr. Juarez for\nemployment documents. Mr. Juarez provided his valid Social Security number.\n27. Ms. Lewandowski then asked Mr. Juarez whether he had a \"green card\" or\nwhether he was a U.S.citizen. Mr. Juarez informed Ms. Lewandowski that he had DACA status\nand an EAD and explained that he was authorized to legally work in the United States.\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 6 of 12\n28. When Defendant learned that Mr. Juarez was not a citizen ofthe United States and\ndid not have a green card, it blocked Mr. Juarez from receiving the job.\n29, On December 17,2013,Mr. Juarez emailed Ms. Lewandowski and informed her\nthat based on his research, because he had an EAD, he could legally work for Northwestern\nMutual regardless ofwhether he was a citizen or had a visa.\n30. Later that day, Ms. Lewandowski replied, \"[s]orry but you have to be a US citizen\nor have a green card.\"\n31. Northwestern Mutual advertises its blanket ban against hiring anyone who is not\na U.S.citizen or U.S.permanent resident on its website. The first question that individuals are\nasked to answer on an online \"assessment\" form is: \"Doyou have a [sic] least 3 years of\ncontinuous U.S.residency, hold a permanent resident visa and read, write and speak English\nfluently?\" Ifthe respondent answers \"no\"to this question, she is taken to apage with the\nfollowing statement ofpolicy: \"Financial representatives must have at least three years of\ncontinuous U.S.residency, hold a permanent resident visa and read, write and speak English\nfluently. A financial representative intern must hold a current student or resident visa, have three\nyears continuous residency or anticipated three years ofcontinuous residency completed upon\ncollege graduation, and read, write and speak English fluently, Your answers to our screening\nquestions indicated that you did not fulfill one or more ofthese qualifications. Ifyou anticipate\nmeeting these requirements in the future, we do hope to you consider investigating opportunities\nwith the Northwestern Mutual\nagain.\"'ackground\nInformation, NDRTHWESTERN MUTUAL, https://www.selfmgmt.corn/cgi-\nbin/assessment.exe? testtype=s12kfunction=cackac=025266188293kwrappeis=clients(nmfn2kc\nustomcaption=%20 (last visited July 9,2014).\nBackground Information, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL, https://www.selfmgmt.corn/cgi-\nbin/assessment.exe? testtype=s12k function=cack ac=025266188293&wrappers=clients(nmfn2kc\nustomcaption=%20 (last visited June 9, 2014).\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 7 of 12\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n32. Plaintiff brings his class allegations under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(2) and (b)(3)\non behalf ofa class defined as follows: All persons, who are within the jurisdiction ofthe United\nStates and legally authorized to work in the United States, who were denied the right to work at\nNorthwestern Mutual because they are not U.S.citizens or U.S.permanent residents between July\n9, 2010 and the date ofjudgment in this action (the \"Class\").\n33. Plaintiff is a member ofthe Class.\n34, Upon information and belief, the members ofthe Class are so numerous that\njoinder ofall ofthem is impracticable. Northwestern Mutual has offices throughout the United\nStates, USCIS has approved over 500,000 requests for DACA, and there are thousands ofpeople\nwho despite having work authorization do not meet Northwestern Mutual's immigration status\nand residency requirements. Plaintiff does not know the precise number ofClass Members —this\ninformation is in Northwestern Mutual's possession.\n35. There are questions oflaw and fact common to the Class, and these questions\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members. Common questions include,\namong others: (1)whether it is Northwestern Mutual's policy or practice to reject job applicants\nor terminate current workers who are legally authorized to work in the United States because they\nare not U.S.citizens or U.S.permanent residents; (2) whether Northwestern Mutual's policy as\nset forth above deprives Plaintiff and the Class ofthe right to contract for work in violation of42\nU.S.C. 1981;(3)whether Plaintiff and the Class suffered harm by reason ofDefendant's\n$\nunlawful policy; (4) whether Plaintiff and the Class are entitled to back pay relief; (5)whether\nPlaintiff and the Class are entitled to compensatory damages; (6)whether Plaintiff and the Class\nare entitled to punitive damages; (7)what equitable and injunctive relief for the Class is\nwarranted; and (8)the scope ofa resulting permanent injunction.\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 8 of 12\n36. Plaintiff's claims are typical ofthe claims ofthe Class: (l) Plaintiff was within the\njurisdiction ofthe United States and not a citizen ofthe United States; (2) Plaintiff was legally\nauthorized to work within the United States; (3)Plaintiff applied for a position at Northwestern\nMutual; and (4) Plaintiff was rejected because he was not a citizen or permanent resident ofthe\nUnited States. All ofthese claims are substantially shared by each and every class member. All\nofthe claims arise from the same course ofconduct by Defendant, and the relief sought is\ncommon.\n37. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests ofthe\nmembers ofthe Class. Plaintiff has no conflict with any class member. Plaintiff is committed to\nthe goal ofhaving Northwestern Mutual revise its hiring requirements to stop discriminating\nagainst Plaintiff and others who are immigrants, but legally authorized to work in the United\nStates.\n38. Plaintiff has retained counsel competent and experienced in complex employment\ndiscrimination class actions.\n39. The universe ofpeople affected by Northwestern Mutual's unlawful policy is\nascertainable through Defendant's records and therefore the proposed class is ascertainable.\n40. Class certification is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because\nNorthwestern Mutual has acted and/or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class,\nmaking appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff and the Class as a\nwhole. Northwestern Mutual has refused to hire and/or terminated anyone who is not a citizen or\ngreen card holder with at least three years ofcontinuous U.S.residency, i.e.,the Class. The Class\nmembers are entitled to injunctive relief to end Northwestern Mutual's common, uniform, unfair,\nand discriminatory policy and/or practice including priority instatement and other make-whole\nrelief.\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 9 of 12\n41. Class ceitification is also appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure\n23(b)(3) because common questions offact and law predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members ofthe Class, and because a class action is superior to other available\nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication ofthis litigation since joinder ofall members is\nimpracticable. The Class Members have been damaged and are entitled to recovery as a result of\nNorthwestern Mutual's common, uniform, unfair, and discriminatory policies and practices.\nDamages are capable ofmeasurement on a classwide basis and will be calculated based on the\nwages lost due to Northwestern Mutual's unlawful practices. The propriety and amount of\npunitive damages are based on Northwestern Mutual's conduct, making these issues common to\nthe Class. Plaintiff and the Class will rely on common evidence to resolve their legal and factual\nquestions. There are no pending actions raising similar claims. The proposed representative for\nthe Class is aNew York resident. Defendant engages in continuous, permanent, and substantial\nactivity in New York. There will be no undue difficulty in the management ofthis litigation as a\nclass action.\nCLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Alienage Discrimination)\n42 U.S.C 1981\ng\n42. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in all preceding paragraphs.\n43. Plaintiff brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf ofthe Class.\n44, Plaintiff is a person within the jurisdiction ofthe United States.\n45. Plaintiff is an alien.\n46. Plaintiff is legally authorized to work in the United States,\n47. Northwestern Mutual intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff and the Class on\nthe basis ofalienage by rescinding or denying them contracts to work or deterring them from\nwork opportunities because they are neither citizens ofthe United States nor permanent residents\n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 2   Filed 07/09/14   Page 10 of 12\nand do not have at least three years ofcontinuous U.S.residency.\n48. Northwestern Mutual's intentional discrimination against Plaintiff and the Class\ninterfered with their right to make and enforce work contracts.\n49. Defendant's policy and practice ofdenying work opportunities based on Plaintiff's\nand the Class's alienage despite being legally authorized to work within the United States harmed\nPlaintiff and the Class and constitutes unlawful alienage discrimination in the making and\nenforcing ofcontracts in violation of42 U.S.C.$ 1981.\n50. Plaintiff and the Class have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law to\nredress the wrongs alleged herein, and the injunctive relief sought in this action is the only means\nofsecuring complete and adequate relief. Plaintiff and the Class he seeks to represent are now\nsuffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable injury from Defendant's discriminatory acts and\nomissions.\n51. Defendant's conduct has caused, and continues to cause, Plaintiff and the\nmembers ofthe Class substantial losses in earnings and other work benefits,\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for relief as follows:\n52. Certification ofthe case as a class action on behalf ofthe proposed Class;\n53. Designation ofPlaintiff Ruben Juarez as a representative on behalf ofthe Class;\n54.

FORREST, District Judge: \nOn July 9, 2014, plaintiff Ruben Juarez (\"plaintiff' or \"Juarez\") filed this \naction, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, against The \nNorthwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, Inc. (\"defendant\" or \"Northwestern \nMutual\"), alleging alienage discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.  (ECF \nNo. 2 (\"Compl.\").)  Plaintiff alleges that he was legally authorized to work in the \nUnited States, applied for a position at Northwestern Mutual, and was rejected \npursuant to a policy that denies employment to all persons who are not U.S. citizens \nor legal permanent residents (\"LPRs\").  On September 4, 2014, defendant filed a \nmotion to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim.  (ECF No. 22.)  The \nmotion became fully briefed on October 10, 2014 (ECF No. 40) and the Court heard \noral argument on the motion on November 3, 2014.  For the reasons set forth below, \nthe motion is DENIED. \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 2 of 17\nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Complaint alleges the following facts.1  The Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") is a federal program that authorizes recipients to \nremain in the United States for two years2 and to obtain an Employment \nAuthorization Document (\"EAD\"), a federal work permit, and a Social Security \nnumber.  (See Compl. iii! 16-17.)  Juarez is a Mexican national residing in New \nYork.  (Id. ii 2.)  On October 25, 2012, Jaurez obtained DACA status.3  (Id. ii 20.) \nJuarez obtained an EAD around the same time and received a Social Security \nnumber on November 2, 2012.  (Id. iii! 20-21.) \nOn October 26, 2012, Juarez submitted a resume to a Northwestern Mutual \nrepresentative who was recruiting college students to become interns.  (Id. ii 22.) \nOn December 11, 2013, Juarez interviewed at Northwestern Mutual with Susan \nLewandowski (\"Lewandowski\").  (Id. ii 25.)  After the interview, Lewandowski \nrequested Juarez's employment documents.  (Id. ii 26.)  Juarez provided his valid \nSocial Security number.  (Id.)  Lewandowski then asked Juarez whether he was a \nU.S. citizen or a green-card holder.  (Id. ii 27.)  Juarez explained that he had DACA \nstatus and an EAD and that he was legally authorized to work in the United States. \n(Id.)  On December 17, 2013, Juarez e-mailed Lewandowski and informed her that, \nbased on his research, \"he could legally work for Northwestern Mutual regardless of \nwhether he was a citizen or had a visa.\"  (Id. ii 29.)  Later that day, Lewandowski \n1 The Court sets out here only those facts that are relevant to defendant's motion to dismiss. \n2 Recipients may seek renewal of their DACA status for an additional two years.  (Com pl. i! 16.) \n3 The Court has been advised that, on October 29, 2014, Juarez's DACA status was renewed for an \nadditional two years.  (See Defendant's Letter of November 7, 2014 at 3, ECF No. 42.) \n2 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 3 of 17\nreplied, \"[s]orry but you have to be a US citizen or have a green card.\"  (Id. if 30 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).)  According to the Complaint, \"Northwestern \nMutual advertises its blanket ban against hiring anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or \nU.S. permanent resident on its website.\"4  (Id. if 31.) \nOn July 9, 2014, Juarez filed this putative class action against Northwestern \nMutual, alleging alienage discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.  (ECF No. \n2.)  On September 4, 2014, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint for \nfailure to state a claim.  (ECF No. 22.)  That motion is the subject of this Opinion & \nOrder. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege \n\"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"  Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  \"A claim has facial plausibility when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  In applying that \n4 The specific policy alleged in the Complaint is as follows: \nFinancial representatives must have at least three years of continuous U.S. residency, hold a \npermanent resident visa and read, write and speak English fluently.  A financial \nrepresentative intern must hold a current student or resident visa, have three years \ncontinuous residency or anticipated three years of continuous residency completed upon \ncollege graduation, and read, write and speak English fluently. \n(Compl. iJ 31.)  For simplicity, the Court will describe the policy as requiring U.S. citizenship or legal \npermanent residency.  For purposes of resolving the instant motion, the only important feature of \nthe policy is that it denies employment opportunities to (and only to) a subclass of aliens. \n3 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 4 of 17\nstandard, the court accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws \nall reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor, but does not credit \"mere conclusory \nstatements\" or \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.\"  Id. (citing \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555). \nB.  Section 1981 \nSection 1981 provides in relevant part, \"All persons within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make \nand enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens ....\"   42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). \nThe statute, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, prohibits both public and \nprivate actors from discriminating on the basis of race or alienage in the making \nand enforcement of contracts, including employment contracts.  See Anderson v. \nConboy, 156 F.3d 167, 170, 180 (2d Cir. 1998).  Alienage discrimination is \ndiscrimination on the basis of citizenship.  See, e.g., Anderson, 156 F.3d at 171 \n(observing that § 1981's \"juxtaposition of 'persons' and 'citizens' suggests that it \nprohibits alienage discrimination\" (emphasis added)); see also 8 U.S.C. § 110l(a)(3) \n(defining \"alien\" as \"any person not a citizen or national of the United States\"). \n\"Alienage discrimination is distinct from both national-origin and birthplace \ndiscrimination.\"  Anderson, 156 F.3d at 171 n.5 (citation omitted). \nTo state a claim under § 1981, a plaintiff must allege that (1) he or she is a \nmember of a protected class, (2) the defendant intentionally discriminated against \nhim or her on the basis of membership in that protected class; and (3) the \ndiscrimination concerned one of§ 1981's enumerated activities.  See Brown v. City \n4 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 5 of 17\nof Oneonta, 221 F.3d 329, 339 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).5  \"[Section] 1981, \nlike the Equal Protection Clause, can be violated only by purposeful discrimination.\" \nGen. Bldg. Contractors Ass'n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 (1982). \nPurposeful discrimination is \"conduct motivated by a discriminatory purpose,\" \nrather than conduct that \"merely result[s] in a disproportionate impact on a \nparticular class.\"  Id. at 386; see also id. at 388 (quoting a case for the proposition \nthat § 1981 would be violated if a private actor discriminated against someone \n\"solely because\" of his race). \nC.  Relationship Between§ 1981 and the Fourteenth Amendment \nThere is a close relationship between§ 1981 and the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSection 1981 is derived from Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Section 16 \nof the Voting Rights Act of 1870.  Anderson, 156 F.3d at 172.  \"Both of these laws, in \nturn, were legislative cousins of the Fourteenth Amendment\": \nThe 1866 Act represented Congress' first attempt to ensure equal rights for \nthe freedmen following the formal abolition of slavery effected by the \nThirteenth Amendment.  As such, it constituted an initial blueprint of the \nFourteenth Amendment, which Congress proposed in part as a means of \n\"incorporat[ing] the guaranties of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 in the organic \nlaw of the land.\"  The 1870 Act, which contained the language that now \nappears in§ 1981, was enacted as a means of enforcing the recently ratified \nFourteenth Amendment. \nGen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 389 (citations omitted).  \"In light of the close \nconnection between these Acts and the Amendment, it would be incongruous to \nconstrue the principal object of their successor, § 1981, in a manner markedly \n5 Brown addressed discrimination on the basis of race, but Anderson held that alienage is also a \nprotected characteristic under§ 1981.  See Anderson, 156 F.3d at 180. \n5 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 6 of 17\ndifferent from that of the Amendment itself.\"  Id. at 389-90.  In particular, \n\"purposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment will also violate § 1981.\"  Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, \n276 n.23 (2003) (citing Gen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 389-90).  The pleading \nstandards for two claims are also the same.  See Brisbane v. Milano, 443 F. App'x \n593, 594 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Defendant's argument \nDefendant does not dispute that the Complaint sufficiently alleges the first \nand third elements required to state a claim under § 1981-namely, that plaintiff \nwas a member of a protected class and that the alleged discrimination concerned \none of§ 1981's enumerated activities.  Rather, defendant argues that the Complaint \nfails because it does not (and cannot) plausibly allege that Northwestern Mutual \nengaged in intentional, purposeful discrimination on the basis of alienage.  (See \nDefendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss (\"Def.'s \nMem.\") at 1, ECF No. 23.)  Defendant cites Igbal for the meaning of \"discriminatory \npurpose\": \nUnder extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than \"intent \nas volition or intent as awareness of consequences.\"  It instead involves a \ndecisionmaker's undertaking a course of action '\"because of,' not merely 'in \nspite of,' [the action's] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 676-77 (citations omitted).  According to defendant, Northwestern \nMutual's willingness to hire LPRs-\"the single largest group of non-U.S. citizens \nwho are authorized to work in the United States\"-renders implausible any \n6 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 7 of 17\nallegation that the company refused to hire Juarez \"because of' his lack of U.S. \ncitizenship.  (Def.'s Mem. at 1; see also id. at 15 (\"[The] Complaint acknowledges \nthat if he had held a green card, Juarez would have been welcome to apply for a \ncontract notwithstanding his lack of United States citizenship.\"); 1113/14 Tr.6 at 11 \n(\"[The policy] clearly couldn't be driven by a motive, an intent, purposeful \ndiscrimination against someone because of their lack of citizenship, or they would \nhave excluded all of them.\").)  According to defendant, the Complaint at most \nplausibly alleges that Juarez was turned away because of his work authorization or \nimmigration status (that is, his lack of a green card)-a classification that does not \nfall within the ambit of§ 1981.  (See Def.'s Mem. at 4; 11/3/14 Tr. at 19 (\"Mr. Juarez \nwas not turned away because he was not a citizen.  He was turned away because he \ndidn't have a green card ....\" ).)  Relatedly, defendant argues that Juarez has not \npled \"specific facts giving rise to a reasonable inference of discriminatory animus \nand purpose\" (Def.'s Mem. at 14), as required to state a claim under§ 1981.  (Id. at \n14-15.) \nB.  The Court's Analysis \nThe policy alleged in the Complaint-essentially, \"Legal aliens without green \ncards need not apply\"-on its face discriminates against a subclass of lawfully \npresent aliens.  Juarez's allegations that he was denied employment pursuant this \npolicy are sufficient to state a claim under§ 1981.  This conclusion follows directly \nfrom three premises, each of which is well supported in the law: (1) § 198l's \n6 Citations to \"11/3/14 Tr.\" refer to the transcript of the oral argument held on November 3, 2014. \n7 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 8 of 17\nprotection against discrimination extends to all lawfully present7 aliens, whether or \nnot they have a green card; (2) a plaintiff need not allege discrimination against all \nmembers of a protected class to state a claim under§ 1981; and (3) a plaintiff can \nplead intentional discrimination by alleging that the defendant acted pursuant to a \nfacially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment based on a protected \ntrait.  The Court elaborates on each of these premises in turn. \nThe protection of§ 1981, like that of the Fourteenth Amendment, extends to \nall lawfully present aliens, whether or not they have a green card.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n1981 (\"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same \nright .... \" (emphasis added)); Anderson, 156 F.3d at 173-7 4 (explaining that \"any \nprohibition against alienage discrimination [in§ 1981] must be derived from Section \n16 of the 1870 Act,\" id. at 173, and later concluding that \"Section 16 was to apply to \nall aliens,\" id. at 174); see also Torao Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. \n410, 419-20 (1948) (\"The protection of[§ 1981 (then codified at 8 U.S.C. § 41)] has \nbeen held to extend to aliens as well as to citizens. . . .  The Fourteenth Amendment \nand the laws adopted under its authority thus embody a general policy that all \npersons lawfully in this country shall abide 'in any state' on an equality of legal \nprivileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws.\" (emphasis added) \n(footnote omitted)).  Indeed, defendant does not dispute that all lawfully present \n7 The Court need not address the extent, if any, to which§ 1981's protection against discrimination \nextends to illegal or undocumented aliens. \n8 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 9 of 17\naliens, including those who do not hold green cards, are protected under§ 1981. \n(See 1113/14 Tr. at 15.) \nDefendant also does not dispute that a plaintiff need not allege \ndiscrimination against all members of a protected class to state a claim under§ \n1981.  (See Reply Brief in Support of Northwestern Mutual's Motion to Dismiss at \n2-3 (acknowledging that the \"observation that a principal cannot escape liability for \nunlawful discrimination against one member of a protected class merely by \nestablishing that it did not discriminate against every member of that protected \nclass\" is \"unremarkable\" and \"undisputed\"), ECF No. 40.)  In Brown v. Henderson, \nthe Second Circuit explored this issue in the context of a Title VII claim of sex \ndiscrimination by virtue of a hostile work environment.  See 257 F.3d 246, 252-55 \n(2d Cir. 2001).  Like Juarez, the plaintiff in Brown was required to show that the \nchallenged conduct occurred \"because of' her protected characteristic.  Id. at 252. \nAlthough ultimately concluding that the plaintiff could not show that she was \ndiscriminated against because of her sex,s id. at 256, the Second Circuit rejected the \ndefendant's argument that \"there could be no discrimination 'because of sex' where \nboth a woman ([the plaintiff]) and a man ... were harassed,'' id. at 252.  The Court \nexplained that \"discrimination against one employee cannot be cured, or disproven, \nsolely by favorable, or equitable, treatment of other employees of the same race or \nsex.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  Similarly, \"whether an employer discriminates against \nonly a subset of a protected class or discriminates inconsistently, Title VII \n8 Unlike this case, Brown did not involve a facially discriminatory policy. \n9 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 10 of 17\nnevertheless protects any individual so long as that individual is mistreated \nbecause of her sex.\"  Id. at 253 (citations omitted).  The same principles apply to \n§ 1981 claims.  See Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., 223 F.3d 62, 69 (2d \nCir. 2000) (quoting a case for the proposition that \"[i]n analyzing§ 1981 claims, we \napply the same standards as in Title VII cases\" (quoting Hardin v. S.C. Johnson & \nSon, Inc., 167 F.3d 340, 34 7 n.2 (7th Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nA defendant is not insulated from § 1981 liability for intentional discrimination \nagainst some members of a protected class merely because not every member of the \nclass becomes a victim of the discrimination.9 \nFinally, while defendant is correct that\"§ 1981 reaches only purposeful \ndiscrimination,\" Gen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 389, a plaintiff who alleges a \npolicy that is discriminatory on its face is not required to make any further \nallegations of discriminatory intent or animus.  The Second Circuit has explained \nthat there are \"several ways for a plaintiff to plead intentional discrimination that \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause,\" Brown, 221 F.3d at 337, and that the same \npleadings standards apply to § 1981 claims, id. at 339.  One of the ways to plead \nintentional discrimination is to point to a law or policy that expressly classifies \npeople on the basis of a protected characteristic.  Id. at 337; see also Hazen Paper \n9 Put differently, a plaintiff can state a claim under§ 1981 by alleging that defendant imposed an \nadditional burden on a protected class, even if some members of the class are able to overcome that \nburden.  See Joseph v. New York Yankees P'ship, No. 00 Civ. 2275 (SHS), 2000 WL 1559019, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2000) (\"Assuming [the plaintiffs] allegations are true and that she was required to \nfulfill an additional condition that non-minority customers were not before she could contract for \ndining services, she would be limited in her right to contract as she could not enjoy 'all benefits, \nprivileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship' to the same extent as non-minority \ncustomers.\" (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1981)). \n10 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 11 of 17\nCo. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993) (\"The employer may have relied upon a \nformal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with \n[a protected] trait.\" (citations omitted)); Amini v. Oberlin Coll., 440 F.3d 350, 359 \n(6th Cir. 2006) (\"[P]roof of 'a facially discriminatory employment policy ... to [avoid \nhiring] employees in the protected group is direct evidence of discriminatory \nintent.\"' (citations omitted)).  It follows that allegations that Juarez's application \nwas rejected pursuant to a policy that expressly denies employment to lawfully \npresent aliens without green cards-a protected subclass-suffice to state a claim \nunder § 1981. \nDefendant misinterprets the law when it argues that Northwestern Mutual's \nwillingness to hire some lawfully present aliens renders implausible any allegation \nof intentional discrimination on the basis of alienage.  Iqbal's statement that \npurposeful discrimination requires that the adverse action be taken \"because of' \nrather than \"in spite of' a protected characteristic, see 556 U.S. at 676-77, is \nconsistent with the principle that one of the ways to engage in purposeful \ndiscrimination is to apply a policy that is discriminatory on its face.  Facial \ndiscrimination is discrimination \"because of' a protected characteristic.  An \nemployer cannot implement a policy, \"Members of protected class P need not apply,\" \nand then successfully argue that the policy was not motivated by any animus \ntoward the protected class.  Similarly, the employer cannot implement a policy that \nexpressly discriminates against members of a protected class (here, lawfully present \naliens) with characteristic X (here, lack of LPR status) and then, when a rejected \n11 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 12 of 17\ncandidate files a lawsuit, successfully argue that case should be dismissed because \nthe discrimination was on the basis of X rather than the protected trait.  Such an \nargument fails at pleadings stage irrespective of the nature of characteristic X: X \ncould be a particular eye color (\"Aliens with blue eyes need not apply\") or X could \nbe, as here, a particular immigration status (\"Aliens without LPR status need not \napply\").  The important point is that the alleged policy facially singles out a \n10 \nprotected subclass for adverse treatment. \nHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604 (1993), does not support \ndefendant's position.  In Biggins, the Supreme Court held that an employer does not \nviolate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\") \"just by \ninterfering with an older employee's pension benefits that would have vested by \nvirtue of the employee's years of service.\"  Id. at 613.  The Court explained that \ndiscrimination on the basis of years of service does not run afoul of the ADEA \nbecause \"an employee's age is analytically distinct from his years of service\": \nAn employee who is younger than 40, and therefore outside the class of older \nworkers as defined by the ADEA, see 29 U.S.C. § 631(a), may have worked for \na particular employer his entire career, while an older worker may have been \nnewly hired.  Because age and years of service are analytically distinct, an \nemployer can take account of one while ignoring the other, and thus it is \nincorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily \"age \nbased.\" \nId. at 611.  Unlike in Biggins, where the classification was on the basis of a \ncharacteristic (years of service) that was merely correlated with a protected trait \n10 There is no question that an employer may have good business reasons to refuse to hire aliens who \nare not LPRs-reasons that would not justify discriminating on the basis of eye color.  However, any \nsuch reasons are irrelevant to the present motion. \n12 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 13 of 17\n(age), the classification alleged here is expressly based on a protected trait: the \nalleged policy singles out a subclass of aliens, namely those without green cards, \nand denies them employment.  A Biggins-like analogue would be a policy that \ndiscriminates against employees over 50 with Y years of service.11 \nC.  Equal Protection Cases \nThe conclusion that Juarez has stated a plausible claim under§ 1981 is \nsupported by a long line of precedent interpreting the Equal Protection Clause.12  In \n11 Defendant's reliance on Vaughn v. City of New York, No. 06-CV-6547 (ILG), 2010 WL 2076926 \n(E.D.N.Y. May 24, 2010), is also misplaced.  In stating that \"alienage discrimination is \ndiscrimination on the basis of citizenship status, not immigrant status,\" id. at * 10, Vaughn was \ndistinguishing between alienage discrimination and national origin discrimination.  See id. (citing \ncases for the proposition that§ 1981 does not prohibit national origin discrimination).  Here, there is \nno question that the alleged policy classifies people on the basis of alienage rather than national \norigin. \nFinally, Talwar v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., No. 12-CV-0033 (CBA)(JMA), 2014 WL \n5784626 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014), which is currently on appeal before the Second Circuit, is \ndistinguishable from this case.  In Talwar, the plaintiff argued that her employer violated§ 1981 by \ninsisting that she obtain an unlimited medical license, which was available only to citizens and \nLPRs.  See id. at *7.  Importantly, the employer did not impose this requirement on Dr. Talwar until \nafter she complained about her salary.  The district court found that the plaintiffs own testimony on \nthis point undercut any inference that her employer discriminated against her because she was an \nalien: \nHere, ... any [inference of discrimination on the basis of alienage] is entirely undercut by the \nfact that Dr. Talwar's own testimony establishes that Dr. Simpkins took these actions only \nafter she complained about her salary.  Given her long and amicable relationship with Dr. \nSimpkins, Dr. Talwar acknowledges that Dr. Simpkins did not \"suddenly develop a dislike\" \nfor her because she was not a citizen.  Instead, Dr. Talwar testified at her deposition that she \nbelieved the revision of her employment contract and the scrutiny of her citizenship status \nwere a \"cover\" in order to retaliate against her for her complaints about a pay disparity.  In \nother words, under Dr. Talwar's own theory of the facts, defendants' sudden insistence that \nshe obtain an unlimited medical license was pretext for her complaints to Dr. Simpkins \nabout her salary. \nId. (citations omitted).  Unlike the employer in Talwar, Northwestern Mutual allegedly rejected \nplaintiffs application pursuant to a policy that expressly denied employment to a subset of aliens. \nAs explained above, the allegation of a facially discriminatory policy-an allegation not made in \nTalwar-obviates the need for additional allegations of discriminatory intent or animus behind the \nalleged adverse action. \n12 Although these cases were not decided on a motion to dismiss, they are relevant because they \nsuggest that the policy alleged in Juarez's Complaint runs afoul of§ 1981.  See Gen. Bldg. \nContractors, 458 U.S. at 389-90 (\"In light of the close connection between these Acts and the \n13 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 14 of 17\nTorao Takahashi, the Supreme Court struck down 13 a California statute that denied \ncommercial fishing licenses to any \"person ineligible [for] citizenship,\" 334 U.S. at \n413 (internal quotation marks omitted), explaining that \"[s]tate laws which impose \ndiscriminatory burdens upon the entrance or residence of aliens lawfully within the \nUnited States\" are invalid, id. at 419.  Then, in Graham v. Richardson, the Supreme \nCourt struck down two state statutes that prevented immigrants from receiving \npublic assistance.  403 U.S. 365, 376 (1971).  Notably, neither statute denied \nbenefits to all aliens: one barred aliens who did not qualify under federal assistance \nprograms, and the second barred aliens who did not satisfy a fifteen-year residency \nrequirement.  See id. at 367-68.  Nonetheless, the Court subjected both statutes to \nstrict scrutiny and held that they violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 376. \nSince Graham, the Court has repeatedly applied strict scrutiny to statutes \ndiscriminating on the basis of alienage.14  See Dandamudi, 686 F.3d at 73 (collecting \ncases).  In Nyquist v. Mauclet, resident aliens challenged the constitutionality a \nNew York statutory provision barring certain resident aliens from receiving state \nfinancial assistance for higher education.  See 432 U.S. 1, 3-5 (1977).  The statutory \nprovision provided: \nAmendment, it would be incongruous to construe the principal object of their successor, § 1981, in a \nmanner markedly different from that of the Amendment itself.\"). \n13 As the Second Circuit has observed, \"the basis for the decision was unclear, appearing to rely on \nboth the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Congress's exclusive power \nunder Article I to control immigration.\"  Anderson, 156 F.3d at 177 (citation omitted). \n14 The Court has recognized two exceptions, neither of which is relevant here.  The first exception is \nthat states' exclusion of aliens from political and governmental functions is subject to only rational \nbasis review.  Dandamudi v. Tisch, 686 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2012).  The second exception allows \nstates more latitude to deny opportunities and benefits to undocumented aliens.  Id. at 74. \n14 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 15 of 17\nCitizenship.  An applicant (a) must be a citizen of the United States, or (b) \nmust have made application to become a citizen, or (c) if not qualified for \ncitizenship, must submit a statement affirming intent to apply for United \nStates citizenship as soon as he has the qualifications, and must apply as \nsoon as eligible for citizenship, or (d) must be an individual of a class of \nrefugees paroled by the attorney general of the United States under his \nparole authority pertaining to the admission of aliens to the United States. \nId. at 3-4.  The district court held that this provision violated the Equal Protection \nClause by discriminating against resident aliens.  Id. at 5-6.  On appeal, the \ndefendants argued, inter alia, that the provision should not be subjected to strict \nscrutiny, id. at 7, because it distinguished \"only within the 'heterogeneous' class of \naliens,\" not \"between citizens and aliens vel non\": \"[a]liens who have applied for \ncitizenship, or, if not qualified for it, who have filed a statement of intent to apply as \nsoon as they are eligible, are allowed to participate in the assistance programs,\" id. \nat 8 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court, citing Graham, \nsquarely rejected this argument, explaining that \"[t]he important points are that \n[the provision] is directed at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it.  The fact \nthat the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it does not discriminate \nagainst the class.\"  Id. at 9 (citations omitted).  The Court struck down the provision \nas unconstitutional.  Id. at 12. \nThe Second Circuit also has affirmed the principle that discrimination \nagainst a subclass of aliens is subject to strict scrutiny.  In Dandamudi, \nnonimmigrant aliensl5 who had temporary authorization from the federal \n15 \"Nonimmigrant\" aliens are aliens whose \"status grants them the right to reside and work in the \nUnited States only temporarily.\"  Dandamudi, 686 F.3d at 70. \n15 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 16 of 17\ngovernment to work in the United States challenged the constitutionality of a New \nYork licensing statute that provided that only U.S. citizens and LPRs were eligible \nfor a pharmacist's license.  686 F.3d at 69-70.  The district court granted plaintiffs' \nmotion for summary judgment, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  Id. at 70.  The \nSecond Circuit rejected the state's argument that the statute should be subjected to \nrational-basis review because it discriminates against only against nonimmigrant \naliens: \"In our view, ... a state statute that discriminates against aliens who have \nbeen lawfully admitted to reside and work in the United States should be viewed in \nthe same light under the Equal Protection Clause as one which discriminates \nagainst aliens who enjoy the right to reside here permanently.\"16  Id.; see also id. at \n7 4-7 5 (\" [T]he [Supreme] Court has never distinguished between classes oflegal \nresident aliens.  The state's argument that suspect class protection extends no \nfurther than to LPRs simply has no mooring in the High Court's prior ventures into \nthis area.\" (footnote omitted)); id. at 76-77 (\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's \nprecedent counsels us to 'judicially craftD a subset of aliens, scaled by how [we] \nperceive the aliens' proximity to citizenship.'  Rather, the Court's precedent \nsupports drawing a distinction among aliens only as between lawfully admitted \naliens and those who are in the United States illegally.\" (footnotes and citations \nomitted)). \n16 In so holding, the Second Circuit disagreed with two contrary decisions in the Fifth and Sixth \nCircuits.  See id. at 72, 75. \n16 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-05107-KBF   Document 44   Filed 11/14/14   Page 17 of 17\nIn these cases, statutes that discriminated against a subclass of lawfully \npresent aliens were subjected to strict scrutiny and struck down as violating the \nEqual Protection Clause.  As in these cases, the policy alleged here is \"is directed at \naliens and that only aliens are harmed by it,\" Nyquist, 432 U.S. at 9.  Given the \nclose connection between§ 1981 and the Equal Protection Clause, Gen. Bldg. \nContractors, 458 U.S. at 389-90, these cases suggest that Juarez's allegations, if \nproven, would establish a violation of§ 1981.  See Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23 \n(\"[P]urposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment will also violate § 1981.\"). \nIV.
