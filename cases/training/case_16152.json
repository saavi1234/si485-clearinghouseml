    "summary": "<p>On September 11, 2017, an individual recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (&ldquo;DACA&rdquo;) program filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (&ldquo;DHS&rdquo;), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (&ldquo;USCIS&rdquo;), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (&ldquo;ICE&rdquo;), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (&ldquo;CBP&rdquo;). The case was assigned to District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff stated that he had been a two-time DACA recipient since 2013. He alleged that in May 2016, DHS had apprehended him in a raid, detained him for a month, and initiated removal proceedings against him solely for unlawful presence. DHS denied the plaintiff's allegations and claimed the arrest was for human smuggling. Because of the removal proceedings, DHS automatically terminated the plaintiff&rsquo;s DACA status, including his employment authorization, leading to his job loss. The plaintiff argued that this automatic status termination, with no notice or opportunity to respond, ran contrary to the USCIS&rsquo;s DACA Standard Operating Procedures (&ldquo;SOP&rdquo;), and thus violated the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;) for being arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. The plaintiff also alleged that the government&rsquo;s actions violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights. He sought declaratory relief and an injunction requiring compliance with the SOP&mdash;i.e., for his DACA authorization to be reinstated and not terminated prior to notice and an opportunity to respond.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff noted that President Donald Trump had, on September 5, 2017, announced a phase-out of the DACA program. This phase-out included a renewal option for current DACA holders with a deadline of Oct. 5, 2017. Given this impending deadline, the plaintiff also moved for a temporary restraining order (&ldquo;TRO&rdquo;) on the same day as the complaint, requesting an expedited hearing. Judge Miller scheduled a motion hearing for September 28, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2017, DHS responded to the plaintiff's motion for a TRO. The government argued that the plaintiff was unlikely to succeed on the merits because (1) he could challenge removal only in removal proceedings in immigration court and not in the district court, and (2) DACA and its associated employment authorization was a discretionary program not governed by the Constitution or the APA. The plaintiff replied on September 26, 2017, arguing that the government&rsquo;s jurisdictional arguments mischaracterized the plaintiff and DACA, and that the government imposed irreparable harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Miller held a TRO motion hearing on September 28, 2017. The next day, the court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining DHS's revocation of plaintiff's DACA status and allowing the plaintiff to apply for an extension. The court found that it had jurisdiction to review DHS's termination of the plaintiff's status, even though the court lacked jurisdiction in the plaintiff's immigration removal proceeding. Next, Judge Miller held that the plaintiff had established a likelihood of success on his claim demonstrating that DHS's termination of his status without reference to the DACA SOP was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Further, due to the status termination and loss of employment, the plaintiff had suffered irreparable harm. 2017 WL 4340385.</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2017, the plaintiff moved to modify the preliminary injunction. He explained that USCIS had not yet adjudicated his pending DACA renewal application, but that his status would expire on December 22, 2017. He asked the court to modify the preliminary injunction to ensure he would retain his status while USCIS processed the renewal application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following a December 12, 2017 motion hearing, the plaintiff alerted the court of a December 13, 2017 news report that ICE had detained a Pennsylvania DACA recipient after a postal delay with his renewal application had caused his status to lapse. DHS objected to the plaintiff introducing the news report.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, 2017, Judge Miller denied the plaintiff's motion to modify the preliminary injunction. The court stated that DHS had complied with the order by reinstating plaintiff's DACA status and employment authorization and accepting his renewal request. Although DHS intended to terminate the plaintiff's status by December 22, 2019, USCIS was also adjudicating his renewal request. The court concluded that since it had ordered DHS to comply with the APA and SOP, DHS was unlikely to improperly terminate the plaintiff's DACA status, detain, or remove him before December 22, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2017, DHS asked the court to dissolve the preliminary injunction and allow the status termination to take effect.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2018, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction. At this point in time, DHS had already terminated the plaintiff's DACA status and denied his renewal application based upon the removal proceedings. The plaintiff alleged that these actions violated the APA, as they lacked reasoned explanation guided by the DACA SOP, as well as his Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiff requested a preliminary injunction vacating and enjoining the purported termination and the purported subsequent denial of his renewal application.</p>\r\n<p>The government moved to dismiss the case on February 23, 2018. DHS argued that the plaintiff lacked standing after his DACA termination, that the case belonged in removal proceedings rather than before the district court, and that the termination implicated no constitutional interest.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2018, the court granted DHS's motion to dismiss without leave to amend the complaint, dissolved the initial preliminary injunction, and denied the plaintiff's January 12 motion for a new preliminary injunction. The court held that the second revocation of the plaintiff's DACA grant complied with the SOP and thus the preliminary injunction could be dissolved. In Judge Miller&rsquo;s view, DHS had considered all the relevant factors in deeming the plaintiff an enforcement priority because of the allegations of human&nbsp;smuggling against him&ndash;even with no further evidence. Thus, DHS did not violate the APA. The court also found no constitutional violations. Judge Miller conceded that DACA implicated due process interests, entitling recipients to a notice and hearing before termination. However, the court held that the plaintiff had in fact received those procedural due process protections. In addition, the court dissolved the preliminary injunction issued on September 29, 2017. 2018 WL 1757668.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff moved for reconsideration on May 10, 2018. The court denied the motion for reconsideration on July 20, 2018 because no newly discovered evidence was presented, no error was made in the initial judgment, and the controlling law had not changed. 2018 WL 3495830.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on August 3, 2018. After reviewing the district court docket, the Ninth Circuit issued an order stating that the appeal did not appear to be a preliminary injunction appeal. The plaintiff filed a reply brief on May 29, 2019, arguing that the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction, dismissal of the case, and entry of judgment was legally erroneous. The plaintiff asked the Ninth Circuit to vacate the district court&rsquo;s decision and remand with instructions to enter a preliminary injunction setting aside USCIS&rsquo;s termination of the plaintiff&rsquo;s DACA status, benefits, and renewal application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was considered for oral argument. However, the Ninth Circuit removed the case from the oral argument calendar on April 4, 2023, due to a scheduling conflict. As of April 16, 2024, no docket activity has occurred since April 4, 2023.</p>",

No. 12, USCIS has reinstated \n1111 Plaintiff’s DACA, accepted his DACA renewal request, and issued Plaintiff a Notice of \n1122 Intent to Terminate (NOIT) his reinstated DACA. Dkt. Nos. 14-1, 14-2, & 14-3.1 At \n1133 present, there is no final agency action to review. Plaintiff’s response to the NOIT is due \n1144 on or before December 16, 2017. Dkt. No. 14-3. At the time of this filing, Plaintiff has \n1155 not yet responded to the NOIT. Assuming that Plaintiff timely responds to the NOIT and \n1166 his response does not overcome the intended grounds for termination, USCIS anticipates \n1177 completing the adjudication of its intended termination of Plaintiff’s reinstated DACA \n1188 and adjudication of his pending DACA renewal request on or before December 22, 2017. \n1199 Moreover, Plaintiff’s now reinstated DACA would expire on its own on December 22, \n2200 2017, even if Defendants took no further action with regard to the NOIT.  \n                                                 \n2211\n1 Although Defendants have issued Plaintiff a NOIT in this matter, it is important to note \n2222\nthat the Court’s Order incorrectly cites the USCIS DACA SOP as requiring that “the \nDACA recipient must be provided with DACA Form 603, and an opportunity respond,” \n2233\nin cases where “USCIS determines, after consulting with ICE, that exercising \n2244\nprosecutorial discretion is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement policies.” Dkt. No. 12 \n2255 at 6; but see Dkt. No. 2-9 at 14 (where “ICE does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer \nshould refer the case to HQSCOPS, through the normal chain of command, to determine \n2266\nwhether or not a NOIT is appropriate.”) (emphasis added). The DACA 603 template \n2277 referenced by the Court is a termination notice template, not a notice of intent to \nterminate template.  Accordingly, the DACA 603 template does not provide an \n2288\nopportunity to respond.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 18   Filed 12/04/17   PageID.648   Page 3 of 7\n \n11   Defendants do not dispute the authority of courts to modify injunctions based on \n22 changes in fact or law “as required by the circumstances of a given case,” U.S. v. \n33 Washington, 853 F.3d 946, 979 (9th Cir. 2017), or the ability of parties to “request \n44 modification in the future to add, upon competent proof, specific other terms” to the \n55 injunction. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fung, 710 F.3d 1020, 1048 (9th Cir. \n66 2013). The party seeking modification or dissolution of an injunction bears the burden of \n77 establishing that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision or dissolution of \n88 the injunction. Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000). \n99   However, Plaintiff mischaracterizes his claim as a motion to modify this Court’s \n1111 Order.2 Modification is not an appropriate frame with which to view the changed facts of \n1122 this case. Indeed, a court “cannot grant a preliminary injunction on the basis of claims not \n1133 asserted.” Garduno's of Ariz., LLC v. Tortilla, Inc., No. 08-CV-1090-DGC(PHx), 2009 \n1144 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88025, at *3 (D. Ariz. Sept. 8, 2009); see also Stewart v. U.S. I.N.S., \n1155 762 F.2d 193, 199 (2d Cir. 1985) (explaining that a party cannot obtain a preliminary \n1166 injunction for claims not asserted in its pleadings).  \n1177   Additionally, claims for injunctive relief become moot once subsequent events \n1188 have made clear the conduct alleged as the basis for the requested relief “could not \n1199 reasonably be expected to recur,” Bayer v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 861 F.3d 853, 864 \n2200 (9th Cir. 2017), and also where “interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably \n2211 eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.” Lindquist v. Idaho State Bd. of \n2222 Corrections, 776 F.2d 851, 854 (9th Cir. 1985) (quoting Los Angeles County v. Davis, \n2233 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)).  \n2244\n2255                                                  \n2 Unlike the authorities on which Plaintiff relies, nothing in this Court’s Order is vague in \n2266\nits implementation such that clarification via modification is warranted. Indeed, this case \n2277 is nothing like Records Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 284 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2002), where \nthe Ninth Circuit approved of district court modification of an injunction where the initial \n2288\nterms of that injunction proved ineffective for the purpose of that injunction. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 18   Filed 12/04/17   PageID.649   Page 4 of 7\n \n11   Even the amendment of a Plaintiff’s complaint in such circumstances would not \n22 preserve an existing preliminary injunction because where an “amended complaint \n33 supersedes the original complaint,” “the asserted basis for the preliminary injunction is no \n44 longer before this court.”). Clay v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., N.A., No. 2:13-CV-00338-\n55 KJM, 2013 WL 1189712, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2013). In fact, where an amended \n66 complaint supersedes a previous complaint, courts have treated as moot pending motions \n77 for injunctive relief and instead permitted parties to refile and address how amendment \n88 has impacted the relief requested. See, e.g. La Jolla Cove Inv'rs, Inc. v. GoConnect Ltd., \n99 No. 11CV1907 JLS JMA, 2012 WL 1580995, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 4, 2012).\n1111   Plaintiff now asks the Court to modify its Order to “enjoin the expiration of Mr. \n1122 Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment authorization pending final resolution of his \n1133 renewal application, including any time to respond to a Notice of Intent to Deny his \n1144 application, and/or the litigation of any denial of his application to ensure full compliance \n1155 with the DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) and all other applicable laws \n1166 and guidelines.” Dkt. No. 13-1 at 1. However, Plaintiff necessarily did not challenge a \n1177 then nonexistent administrative action in his complaint, nor does Plaintiff challenge \n1188 Defendants’ procedures regarding DACA renewal requests.  \n1199   Rather, the relief Plaintiff seeks in his complaint revolves around U.S. Customs \n2200 and Border Protection’s May 7, 2016, issuance of a Notice to Appear to Plaintiff and \n2211 automatic termination of his DACA. Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶ 84-85. Plaintiff seeks declarations \n2222 regarding the legality of that DACA termination under the APA and constitution, and \n2233 injunctive relief “set[ting] aside and enjoin[ing] Defendants’ decision to terminate Mr. \n2244 Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD;” and “restoring Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and \n2255 attending benefits . . . pending a reconsideration of its termination decision, in which \n2266 Defendants provide him notice of their intent to terminate, a reasoned basis for that \n2277 intent, and an opportunity to respond with argument and evidence.” Dkt. No. 1 at 26. \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 18   Filed 12/04/17   PageID.650   Page 5 of 7\n \n11   With the reinstatement of Plaintiff’s DACA and employment authorization, the \n22 prior DACA termination he challenged is no longer final. Moreover, in issuing a NOIT, \n33 Defendants have already provided Plaintiff the notice, basis, and opportunity to respond \n44 that he seeks. Notably, the harm Plaintiff cited in support of his preliminary injunction \n55 motion – his inability to seek renewal of his DACA were it not reinstated – is not tied to \n66 the relief sought in the original complaint, nor could it be. In this way, Plaintiff overstates \n77 the purpose of the Court’s injunction when he states that it was to “remedy the irreparable \n88 harm suffered by Mr. Gonzalez as a result of Defendants’ unlawful revocation and to \n99 provide him a fair adjudication of his renewal application. . . .” Dkt. No. 13-1 at 4. \n1111 Rather, other than its harm determination, the only thing the Court’s order says about \n1122 Plaintiff’s renewal application is that Defendants must accept it, which Defendants have \n1133 done. Dkt. No. 12 at 14; Dkt. No. 14-2. \n1144   Accordingly, Plaintiff has not asserted a viable basis for this Court to modify its \n1155 September 29, 2017 Order. First, the additional injunctive relief that Plaintiff now seeks –\n1166 continuation of his reinstated DACA based on allegations regarding the timing and \n1177 process of Defendants’ adjudication of his DACA renewal – arise from claims regarding \n1188 Plaintiff’s DACA renewal request that have never been pled. Second, the relief Plaintiff \n1199 does seek in his complaint regarding Defendants’ termination of his DACA has already \n2200 been rendered moot by USCIS’s subsequent actions of reinstating and issuing a NOIT, \n2211 and will become all the more moot by December 22, 2017, with USCIS’s decision \n2222 regarding its NOIT or the expiration of Plaintiff’s reinstated DACA in the ordinary \n2233 course of business.3 The mooting of those claims also moots the underlying preliminary \n                                                 \n2244\n3 The district court in Colotl v. Duke, No. 1:17-CV-1670-MHC (N.D. Ga.), did extend its \n2255 initial preliminary injunction pending briefing on a second motion for preliminary \ninjunction and defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. However, that \n2266\ndecision is legal error and wholly inconsistent with that court’s contemporaneous finding \n2277 that: 1) the filing of plaintiff’s amended complaint mooted the prior complaint, and 2) \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss that complaint as moot following adjudication of \n2288\nPlaintiff’s DACA renewal was consistent with that court’s preliminary injunction. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 18   Filed 12/04/17   PageID.651   Page 6 of 7\n \n11 injunction, and the need for Plaintiff to amend his complaint to raise new challenges to \n22 the possible termination of his reinstated DACA and denial of his DACA renewal \n33 request, would demand that Plaintiff seek new injunctive relief. \n44   Additionally, even if the Court finds that Plaintiff’s complaint sufficiently states \n55 claims related to Defendants’ adjudication of his DACA renewal request or that \n66 Plaintiff’s initial claims are not moot or likely to become moot, the Court should still \n77 deny Plaintiff’s modification request because Plaintiff has not demonstrated sufficient \n88 harm. Plaintiff argues that allowing his “lawful presence and employment authorization \n99 to lapse merely because he was barred from applying for renewal early . . . would cause \n1111 him the same irreparable harm as the revocation in the first instance and would defeat the \n1122 purpose of the Court’s injunction.” Dkt. No. 13-1 at 5. However, while Plaintiff asserted \n1133 in his motion in support of a preliminary injunction that he was working for Gate \n1144 Gourmet, Dkt.  No. 2-1 at 7, he has offered no evidence in support of this motion that he \n1155 is working anywhere such that a lapse in employment authorization pending a final \n1166 adjudication of his DACA renewal request or subsequent litigation regarding that request \n1177 would cause him harm. Further, an order continuing Plaintiff’s receipt of DACA and \n1188 employment authorization pending adjudication and possible litigation regarding his \n1199 DACA renewal request would be in direct opposition to preserving the status quo ante, \n2200 because similarly situated DACA requestors are not afforded an extension of their DACA \n2211 pending adjudication of their renewal requests. See archived USCIS DACA FAQs 49 and \n2222 50 at https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions#education (stating that \n2233 renewal requests should be submitted between 150 and 120 days prior to expiration of the \n2244 individual’s DACA to minimize the possibility DACA will expire before a decision is \n2255 reached on his or her renewal request). Moreover, while the Court initially found that the \n2266 balance of factors weighed in Plaintiff’s favor, it is incumbent on the Court to reweigh \n2277 those factors in light of the additional process Plaintiff has received and cited compliance \n2288 to the Court’s interpretation of Defendants’ guidance and SOPs. Here, while Plaintiff \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 18   Filed 12/04/17   PageID.652   Page 7 of 7\n \n11 may ultimately not be satisfied with the result, the additional process Plaintiff has \n22 received markedly diminishes Plaintiff’s ability to suggest he will likely succeed on the \n33 merits – and which the Court should find warrants the denial of Plaintiff’s modification \n44 motion. \n55   Finally, Plaintiff has provided no authority to support his conclusion that he would \n66 be entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond to Defendants’ potential denial of his \n77 DACA renewal request. Accordingly, to the extent the Court extends its preliminary \n88 injunction in the manner sought by Plaintiff, imputing such procedural requirement on \n99 Defendants is unfounded and unwarranted. \n1111   For the above stated reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s modification \n1122 motion. \n \n1133\nDated: December 4, 2017     Respectfully submitted, \n1144  \nCHAD A.

INTRODUCTION \n22   Plaintiff Alberto Luciano Gonzalez Torres, (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Gonzalez”) seeks \n33 the extraordinary remedy from this Court of reinstating the DACA that was previously \n44 terminated sixteen months ago so he may again seek a favorable exercise of the \n55 Government’s prosecutorial discretion. Not only is Plaintiff’s motion for a restraining \n66 order an emergency of his own making, but the relief he seeks requires this Court to \n77 reject decades of precedent to recognize alleged rights and privileges that have never \n88 existed for Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals.  \n99   Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his emergency motion for a temporary \n1111 restraining order or preliminary injunction because he is not likely to succeed in obtaining \n1122 review of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) discretionary decisions to \n1133 issue a Notice to Appear to place him in removal proceedings, and thereby automatically \n1144 terminate his DACA, related employment authorization, and other alleged ancillary \n1155 benefits. \n1166   Throughout his Complaint, Plaintiff places substantial and repeated, but misplaced, \n1177 reliance on Coyotl v. Kelly, 2017 WL 2889681 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017). See Dkt. 2-8, \n1188 Pl.’s Ex. E. Coyotl was both wrongly decided and distinguishable. First, the Coyotl court \n1199 never explained why the jurisdiction-limiting language of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) relates \n2200 solely to the review of discretionary administrative actions. See id. at 8-10. Coyotl \n2211 appears to confuse Section 1252(g) with 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which bars judicial \n2222 review only of certain discretionary determinations. See id. at 8-11. Coyotl is not, \n2233 therefore, persuasive on the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Second, Coyotl is factually \n2244 and procedurally distinguishable. In that case, the termination of DACA did not take \n2255 place via the issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”). But, as discussed below, Plaintiff’s \n2266 DACA was automatically terminated by the issuance of an NTA, a process squarely \n2277 supported by relevant procedures. \n2288  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.409   Page 11 of 36\n \n11 A.  Overview of Deferred Action and the DACA Policy \n22 The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) charges the Secretary of Homeland \n33 Security “with the administration and enforcement” of the INA and “all other laws \n44 relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). \n55 Individuals are removable if, inter alia, “they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have \n66 been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. \n77 United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a). The \n88 federal government cannot practicably remove every removable alien. Rather, “[a] \n99 principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration \n1111 officials.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. DHS, “as an initial matter, must decide whether it \n1122 makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Id. “At each stage the Executive has discretion to \n1133 abandon the endeavor.” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, \n1144 483 (1999) (“AADC”). Like other agencies exercising enforcement discretion, DHS must \n1155 balance a number of factors that are within its expertise. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n1166 821, 831 (1985).  \n1177 Deferred action is “a regular practice” in which the Secretary exercises his \n1188 discretion “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [his] own convenience,” to notify an \n1199 alien of a non-binding decision to forbear from seeking his removal for a designated \n2200 period. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-84; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (“an act of \n2211 administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority”). \n2222 Through “[t]his commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without \n2233 express statutory authorization,” AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 (citations omitted), a removable \n2244 individual may remain present in the United States so long as DHS continues to forbear. \n2255 Deferred action does not confer lawful immigration status or provide any defense \n2266 to removal. Cf. Chaudhry v. Holder, 705 F.3d 289, 292 (7th Cir. 2013) (discussing the \n2277 difference between “unlawful presence” and “unlawful status” as two distinct concepts). \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.410   Page 12 of 36\n \n11 An individual with deferred action remains removable at any time, and DHS has the \n22 discretion to revoke deferred action unilaterally. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85. \n33 On June 15, 2012, DHS issued a memorandum entitled, “Exercising Prosecutorial \n44 Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” \n55 (“DACA Memo”). See Dkt. No. 2-5, Pl.’s Ex. B. That memorandum outlines a policy \n66 known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) that is available to a certain \n77 subset of individuals unlawfully present in this country. The DACA Memo states, “[t]his \n88 memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. \n99 Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.” Id. at \n1111 3. The memo does not address the topics of arrest by DHS or the grounds that DHS will \n1122 consider in terminating deferred action.  \n1133 In mid-August 2012, USCIS published on its website a webpage entitled, \n1144 “Frequently Asked Questions,” which is now archived on the USCIS webpage. See Dkt. \n \n1155 No. 2-11, Pl.’s Ex. H. These FAQs provide guidance on the DACA policy and state, \n1166 “DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated \n1177 at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.” Id. at \n1188 Q:27. The FAQs also explain that the phrase “national security or public safety threat” \n1199 includes but is not limited to “gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or \n2200 participation in activities that threaten the United States.” See id. at Q:65. The Form I-\n2211 821D, entitled, “Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood \n2222 Arrivals” states, “[i]ndividuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into \n2233 removal proceedings or removed from the United States for a specified period of time, \n2244 unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.” \n2255 Exhibit A, Form I-821D Instructions. \n2266 DHS has provided procedural guidance for terminating deferred action in three \n2277 circumstances, one of which includes issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) \n2288 and providing a chance for a DACA recipient to respond, and two in which such notice \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.411   Page 13 of 36\n \n11 and an opportunity to respond is not required. See Dk.t No. 2-9, Pl.’s Ex. F, U.S. \n22 Department of Homeland Security, National Standard Operating Procedures, Deferred \n \n33 Action for Childhood Arrivals (“SOP”) (Aug. 28, 2013); Exhibit B, DACA SOP \n44 Appendix I (March 1, 2016). \n55 Most relevant here is the circumstance wherein a component of DHS, including \n66 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) or U.S. Customs and Border \n77 Protection (“CBP”), issues an NTA that commences removal proceedings once filed with \n88 an immigration court. CBP or ICE may issue an NTA if the facts and circumstances \n99 available at the time an alien is encountered counsel against the continuation of deferred \n1111 action, including where there is a criminal offense or public safety concern presented. \n1122 Moreover, USCIS can refer individuals for removal after termination of DACA if USCIS \n1133 becomes aware of a disqualifying criminal offense or public safety concern deemed to be \n1144 an Egregious Public Safety (EPS) issue. USCIS’s November 7, 2011, Policy \n1155 Memorandum identified shared NTA authority between USCIS, ICE, and CBP as a \n1166 means of ensuring consistency in enforcement. See Dkt. No. 2-10, Pl.’s Ex. G. Nothing in \n1177 that memorandum limits CBP or ICE from exercising their authority to issue an NTA. \n1188 Rather, pursuant to the DACA SOP and Appendix I, the issuance of an NTA \n1199 automatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to respond. See \n2200 Pl.’s Ex. F; Def.’s Ex. B. USCIS then generally sends a “Notice of Action” to the \n2211 individual informing him that his deferred action and employment authorization \n2222 terminated automatically as of the date the NTA was issued. See Def.’s Ex. B. This \n2233 “Notice of Action” serves an administrative purpose to inform the DACA recipient that \n2244 his DACA and employment authorization was already automatically terminated due to \n2255 issuance of an NTA. The Notice of Action does not itself effectuate the termination of \n2266 DACA and employment authorization. \n2277 On September 5, 2017, DHS announced a plan to end the DACA policy in an \n2288 orderly fashion. See “Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action for Child Arrivals” \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.412   Page 14 of 36\n \n11 from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, to ICE, CBP, and USCIS \n22 (Sept. 5, 2017) (“Duke Memo”). See Dkt. 1 at ¶ 21. The memorandum, inter alia, \n33 provides that DHS will “adjudicate – on an individual, case by case basis – properly filed \n44 pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment \n55 Authorization Documents . . . from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire \n66 between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by the \n77 Department as of October 5, 2017.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n88 B.  Factual Background \n99 Plaintiff alleges he first requested deferred action and employment authorization \n1111 pursuant to DACA in early 2013. Dkt. No. 2-1 at 6. He was granted deferred action and \n1122 work authorization. Id.; Dkt. 2-12, Pl.’s Ex. I. In 2014, Plaintiff requested renewal of \n1133 DACA and was once again granted deferred action and employment authorization, \n1144 effective through December 22, 2017. Id. at 6-7; Dkt. No. 2-13, Pl.’s Ex. J. The approval \n1155 letter states in relevant part, that “[d]eferred action does not confer or alter any \n1166 immigration status” and that “[u]nless terminated, this decision to defer removal action \n1177 will remain in effect for 2 years from the date of this notice,” although the expiration of \n1188 the notice is three years after issuance. Dkt. No. 2-13. The notice also advises that \n1199 “[s]ubsequent criminal activity after your case has been deferred is likely to result in \n2200 termination of your deferred action.” Id.  \n2211 Plaintiff alleges the following: on May 6, 2016, he was taking care of an \n2222 acquaintance’s dogs at that acquaintance’s house when police knocked on the door \n2233 around 4:00 p.m. See Dkt. 2-19 ¶¶ 9-11. Plaintiff refused permission for the police to \n2244 enter the house, asked for a warrant, and asserts that the police did not produce a warrant \n2255 and stopped talking to him. Id. ¶ 11. At 5:00 p.m., a man Plaintiff did not recognize said \n2266 he was the owner of the house and asked Plaintiff to exit – Plaintiff complied. Id. ¶ 12-14. \n2277 Upon leaving the house, Plaintiff was stopped by police; he told the police that he was a \n2288 DACA recipient, they verified his documents, asked him some questions, and arrested \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.413   Page 15 of 36\n \n11 him. Id. ¶ 14-16. During this encounter, Plaintiff claims that he “sat handcuffed on the \n22 front porch for one or two minutes, unable to see or hear anything that happened inside \n33 the house . . . . I did not see or hear [the officer] speak to anyone who went inside the \n44 house.” Id. ¶ 17.  \n55 Defendants’ narrative is similar to Plaintiff’s, absent Plaintiff’s omissions. First, \n66 Defendants identify that they were investigating an ongoing human smuggling operation \n77 and had received information that human smuggling had taken place in the morning at the \n88 same house where Defendants found Plaintiff later the same day. See Exhibit C.2 at 2, \n99 Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (I-213), Report of Investigation (G-166) and \n1111 related documents pertaining to Plaintiff and his arrest on May 6, 2016. Defendants’ \n1122 narrative also comports with Plaintiff’s retelling of their arrival at the house on the \n1133 afternoon of May 6; however, Defendants made specific note that “Gonzalez appeared \n1144 visibly shaken. When Gonzalez spoke he did so stuttering and it appeared that he had dry \n1155 mouth, consistent with someone who is nervous.” Id. at 3. Defendants’ narrative similarly \nreports that Plaintiff left the house when asked by the landlord, and reports Plaintiff’s \n1166\nstory that he was at the residence to look after two dogs, did not have the key to the \n1177\nproperty, and that he was headed to work and was not responsible for anything inside the \n1188\nhouse. Id. at 3. At this same time, however, Defendants also report that they obtained a \n1199\nladder from the property owner, identified twelve individuals hiding in the attic of the \n2200\nhouse, placed those individuals under arrest for being illegally present in the United \n2211\nStates, and placed Plaintiff and another individual under arrest for harboring illegal \n2222\naliens. Id. at 3-4.1 \n2233\n                                                 \n2244\n1 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) criminalizes the conduct of those who “knowing or in \n2255 reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United \nStates in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to \n2266\nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building \n2277 or any means of transportation.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) states that “[a]ny alien who at \nany time knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to \n2288\nenter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.” \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.414   Page 16 of 36\n \n11 Notably, three of those individuals found in the attic specifically identified Plaintiff \n22 as having a role in their concealment in the attic of the house. See Exhibit C.3 at 9, \n33 Records of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (I-213) pertaining to other individuals arrested \n44 with Plaintiff on May 6, 2016 (identifying two individuals “who lead [sic] the group to a \n55 room and instructed them to stay there,” “instructed them to go into the attic and hide,” \n66 and who identified Plaintiff as one of those individuals in a six-pack photographic line \n77 up); id. at 14 (identifying Plaintiff and his friend through two photographic lineups as the \n88 “stash house care-takers,” and stating “that [Plaintiff] instructed all of [the] individuals at \n99 the house to enter the attic”); id. at 34 (identifying Plaintiff and his friend through two \n1111 photographic lineups as the “stash house care-takers).  \n1122   On May 7, 2016, CBP issued Plaintiff an NTA charging him as inadmissible to the \n1133 United States based on his presence without admission or parole pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n1144 § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). See Dkt. 2-16, Pl.’s Ex. M. That same day, Plaintiff requested that an \n1155 immigration judge review his custody determination. See Exhibit C.1, Notice to Appear \n1166 Served on Immigration Court. The NTA was served on the immigration court on May 18, \n1177 2016. Id. at 1. An immigration judge held a custody hearing on June 1, 2016, and granted \n1188 Plaintiff release from immigration detention on $5,000 bond. See Dkt. 2-15, Pl.’s Ex. L. \n1199 Plaintiff was released from custody on June 3, 2016. See Dkt. 2-1 at 9. \n2200 On September 11, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint seeking an order restoring his \n2211 DACA and employment authorization, and requiring Defendants to provide him with a \n2222 further explanation for its decision and an opportunity to respond. See Dkt. No. 1. That \n2233 same day, Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary \n2244 injunction seeking to enjoin Defendants’ termination of his DACA so that he could seek \n2255 renewal of DACA prior to the October 5, 2017, date established for certain DACA \n2266 recipients to renew their requests as part of the winding down of the DACA policy. See \n2277 Dkt. No. 2. \n2288  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.415   Page 17 of 36\n \n11 II.  ARGUMENT \n22 A.  Standards of Review \n33 “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \n44 positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Texas v. \n55 Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). As a result, it is generally inappropriate at the \n66 “preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.” Id.; see Senate of \n77 State of Cal. v. Mosbacher, 968 F.2d 974, 978 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that “judgment on \n88 the merits in the guise of preliminary relief is a highly inappropriate result”). \n99   The applicable legal standard for a motion for a temporary restraining order is the \n1111 same as that for a motion for a preliminary injunction. Henry Schein, Inc. v. Cook, 191 F. \n1122 Supp. 3d 1072, 1076 (N.D. Cal. 2016). An injunction is “a drastic and extraordinary \n1133 remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course.” As the Supreme Court has \n1144 held, a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish” that: (1) it is likely to \n1155 succeed on the merits of its claims; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \n1166 preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in \n1177 the public interest. Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Preliminary \n1188 injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right, id. at 20, and the \n1199 party seeking such relief bears the burden of establishing the prerequisites to this \n2200 extraordinary remedy. Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). \n2211   Alternatively, a party must show “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a \n2222 hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff,” as well as a likelihood of \n2233 irreparable harm, and that the injunction is in the public interest. Alliance for the Wild \n2244 Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011). Showing “serious questions \n2255 going to the merits” requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a “substantial case for relief on the \n2266 merits.” Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n2277   When a plaintiff seeks an ex parte temporary restraining order, courts also consider \n2288 the imminence of the alleged irreparable injury, and reject such relief when the \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.416   Page 18 of 36\n \n11 emergency is of the plaintiff’s own making. See, e.g., Quach v. Bank of Am., Nat. Ass’n, \n22 No. 12–5037 EJD, 2012 WL 4498873, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept.28, 2012) (finding that an ex \n33 parte TRO to enjoin a foreclosure sale was not justified where plaintiffs were aware for \n44 months of the potential trustee’s sale); William W. Schwarzer, et al., California Practice \n55 Guide: Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial § 13:95 (2010) (“An important factor will \n66 be whether the applicant could have sought relief earlier by a motion for preliminary \n77 injunction, avoiding the necessity for a last-minute TRO. Delay in seeking relief may be \n88 evidence of laches . . . or negate the alleged threat of ‘immediate’ irreparable injury . . . . \n99 The court has discretion to deny the application on either ground”). \n1111   Finally, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks an injunction that “orders a responsible \n1122 party to ‘take action’,” Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 484 (1996), it is a \n1133 mandatory injunction. When granting mandatory injunctive relief, “courts should be \n1144 extremely cautious” and will apply a heightened standard in reviewing whether a plaintiff \n1155 has established a basis for injunctive relief. Stanley v. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, \n1166 1319 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted). Mandatory injunctions “go[ ] well \n1177 beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite [and] is particularly disfavored.” \n1188 Id. at 1320 (internal citations omitted). In a mandatory injunction request, a moving party \n1199 “must establish that the law and facts clearly favor [their] position, not simply that [they] \n2200 [are] likely to succeed.” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \n2211 B.  Plaintiff Cannot Sustain the Requirements for Preliminary Relief. \n2222 1.  Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate Imminent, Irreparable Harm. \n2233 The harm that Plaintiff alleges in support of his emergency motion arises from the \n2244 alleged loss of opportunity to request renewal of his DACA if the Court does not reinstate \n2255 his previously terminated DACA before October 5, 2017. Dkt. No. 2-1 at 1, 24. The Court \n2266 should deny Plaintiff’s motion at the outset because the imminence of the harm Plaintiff \n2277 cites is of his own making. See, e.g., Quach, 2012 WL 4498873, at *4. Defendants \n2288 terminated Plaintiff’s DACA sixteen months ago. While the winding down of the DACA \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.417   Page 19 of 36\n \n11 policy could impact Plaintiff if he still had DACA, Plaintiff’s failure to raise this action to \n22 date is the only reason there is now any urgency to his claim in this Court.  \n33 While Plaintiff may argue that he could not have foreseen the wind-down of \n44 DACA until it was announced on September 5, the fact that he did not move for \n55 reinstatement of DACA, and of the benefits ancillary to it, for sixteen months casts doubt \n66 on his claim of harm if he cannot renew his DACA after October 5, 2017. \n77 2.  Plaintiff is not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n88 Whether viewed as a preliminary or permanent injunction, the Court cannot grant \n99 Plaintiff relief because he cannot succeed on the merits of his claims. First, this Court lacks \n1111 jurisdiction to review Plaintiff’s challenge to DHS’s discretionary determination to issue \n1122 Plaintiff a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) in removal proceedings, which had the result of terminating \n1133 his DACA. Additionally, nothing in the APA or constitutional jurisprudence establishes a \n1144 right to review or constrain DHS’s exercise of discretion or to grant Plaintiff procedural \n1155 rights other than those available to him through his removal proceedings. \n1166 a.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Review DHS’s Initiation \nRemoval Proceedings, and any Judicial Challenges to \n1177\nRemoval Must be Brought in a Petition for Review. \n1188\nThe APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial \n1199\nreview in federal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 \n2200\n§§ U.S.C. 702, 704. A reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be \n2211\n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” \n2222\nor “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). The \n2233\nAPA also precludes judicial review of agency decisions that are “committed to agency \n2244\ndiscretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). In Heckler v. Chaney, the Supreme Court held \n2255\nthat “an agency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune \n2266\nfrom judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985). \n2277\nIndividual DACA decisions fall squarely within that category of agency discretion. \n2288\nA decision to defer action is committed to agency discretion by law because notifying an \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.418   Page 20 of 36\n \n11 alien that DHS has decided to forbear from removing him for a designated period is an \n22 exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and a court has no meaningful standard against which \n33 to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion to forbear from enforcement for that period. \n44 See Heckler, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 828 (9th \n55 Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a type of government \n66 action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial intervention”); Arpaio v. Obama, \n77 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (explaining that “[i]n making immigration enforcement \n88 decisions, the executive considers a variety of factors”), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 900, \n99 (2016), reh’g denied, 136 S. Ct. 1250 (2016). \n1111 Here, Plaintiff cannot establish any likelihood of success on the merits. The INA \n1122 specifically precludes review of the actions that Plaintiff challenges – the discretionary \n1133 decision to issue an NTA and terminate Plaintiff’s DACA, the effects of that decision on \n1144 Plaintiff’s removal proceedings, and the impact on ancillary benefits. Moreover, all of the \n1155 actions challenged are discretionary actions for which there is no law to apply. \n1166 i.  The Court lacks jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \nThe issuance of an NTA to an alien is a necessary predicate step to commencing \n1177\nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Through the INA, \n1188\nas amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005 and codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Congress \n1199\nexplicitly precluded judicial review of any challenge arising from any decision or action \n2200\nto commence removal proceedings. That statute states, in relevant part: \n2211\n \n2222\nExcept as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision \n2233 of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or any \nother habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, \n2244\nno court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf \n2255\nof any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against \n2266\nany alien under this chapter.  \n2277\n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n11 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.419   Page 21 of 36\n \n11 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).2 The Supreme Court explained that § 1252(g) was “directed against a \n22 particular evil: attempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” \n33 AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9. \n44 Applying 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), the Ninth Circuit has specifically held there is no \n55 subject matter jurisdiction to review a decision to grant DACA. See, e.g., Vilchiz-Soto v. \n66 Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[W]e lack jurisdiction to review petitioners’ \n77 contention that the agency abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen to seek \n88 prosecutorial discretion based on the recent order of President Obama.”); Rodriguez v. \n99 Sessions, No. 15-72487, 2017 WL 695192, at *1 (9th Cir. Feb. 22, 2017); Fabian-Lopez \n1111 v. Holder, No. 11-71513, 540 F. App’x 760, 761 n.2 (9th Cir. Apr. 29, 2013); cf. Flores-\n1122 Panso v. Asher, No. C13-1923-TSZ, 2014 WL 1338073, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 2, \n1133 2014) (adopting recommendation that district courts lack jurisdiction over a claim that a \n1144 stay of removal is warranted for a petitioner to seek DACA).3 \n1155 This precedent applies to the present case and precludes judicial review of the \ndecision to issue an NTA, which terminated Plaintiff’s DACA, and which was a predicate \n1166\nstep to commencing removal proceedings. See, e.g., Samayoa-Martinez v. Holder, 558 \n1177\nF.3d 897, 901-02 (9th Cir. 2009) (“Logically, an alien cannot be placed in formal \n1188\nproceedings until those proceedings have been commenced with the filing of the NTA.”).  \n1199\n2200                                                  \n2 For example, courts lack jurisdiction to review the timing of the commencement of \n2211\nremoval proceedings. See Chavez-Navarro v. Ashcroft, 57 F. App’x 349 (9th Cir. 2003). \n2222\nMoreover,  “[a]s  a  general  matter  .  .  .  an  alien  unlawfully  in  this  country  has  no \nconstitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation.” \n2233\nAADC, 525 U.S. at 488, 491 \n2244\n3  This  authority  is  consistent  with  earlier  case  law  interpreting  the  1981  Operating \n2255 Instructions, a previous policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of deferred action.  \nThat authority concluded that district courts lack jurisdiction to review the district director’s \n2266\ndecision not to recommend deferred action. Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1025 \n2277 (9th Cir. 1985); see also Carranza, v. I.N.S., 277 F.3d 65, 72 (1st Cir. 2002) (supporting \n“general proscription against judicial review of any aspect” of prosecutorial deliberations) \n2288\n(citing Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-8 (1985)). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n12 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.420   Page 22 of 36\n \n11 Plaintiff may contend that the present case is distinguishable from these earlier \n22 cases because it involves the Government’s decision to issue an NTA, and thereby \n33 terminate DACA, rather than a determination as to whether an individual is considered \n44 for DACA in the first place. But nothing in the language of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) supports \n55 such a distinction and both decisions are similar in the relevant respect – they both \n66 involve the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Congress had no reason to preclude \n77 judicial review of the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion (where individuals \n88 self-select whether to request DACA in light of agency guidelines) while permitting \n99 judicial review of an agency’s decision to issue an NTA so that it may commence \n1111 removal proceedings and thereby terminate DACA (where the agency weighs competing \n1122 factors and allocates its resources). See Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831 (discussing the \n1133 Executive’s discretion to spend resources on “this violation or another”); Arpaio, 797 \n1144 F.3d at 16, 24 (“Even after they are approved for deferred action . . . beneficiaries are \n1155 subject to the Department’s overall enforcement priorities”). If anything, the decision to \nissue an NTA, which results in termination of DACA, is more closely connected with the \n1166\ncentral purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) – to prevent “judicial constraints on prosecutorial \n1177\ndiscretion.” See AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9. Thus, decisions to issue an NTA and thereby \n1188\nterminate DACA are even further outside the scope of judicial review than determinations \n1199\nof whether to grant DACA in the first place.  \n2200\n  Additionally, the Court should reject, as contrary to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Plaintiff’s \n2211\ncontention that his case is distinguishable from Ninth Circuit case law because he is \n2222\nchallenging the Government’s decision-making process rather than the final decision \n2233\nitself. Section 1252(g) is not limited to claims arising from the adjudication of cases. It \n2244\nbroadly precludes judicial review of “cause[s] or claim[s]” that arise from the decision “or \n2255\naction” to “commence proceedings” against any alien. See, e.g., Sissoko v. Rocha, 509 \n2266\nF.3d 947, 948-50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding claim of money damages arose from decision \n2277\nor action to commence removal proceedings and was, thus, barred by 8 U.S.C. \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n13 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.421   Page 23 of 36\n \n11 § 1252(g)).4 To hold otherwise would render 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) a dead letter because any \n22 alien could seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge the commencement of removal \n33 proceedings through this type of creative pleading. Lastly, Plaintiff’s argument that his \n44 claims under the APA are not barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) because they challenge \n55 nondiscretionary rather than discretionary duties necessarily fails because 8 U.S.C. \n66 § 1252(g) does not distinguish between discretionary and nondiscretionary duties.5 See \n77 Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (rejecting contention that \n88 § 1252(g) applies only to discretionary decisions of the Secretary, emphasizing that \n99 § 1252(g), by its plain language, “makes no distinction between discretionary and \n1111 nondiscretionary decisions”); see also Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th \n1122                                                  \n1133 4 In Sissoko, the Ninth Circuit held that because the plaintiff’s detention arose from the \ndecision to commence removal proceedings, Bivens jurisdiction was barred by 8 U.S.C. \n1144\n§ 1252(g). Sissoko, 509 F.3d at 949. The court distinguished between these types of claims \n1155 and those raised in an earlier Ninth Circuit case discussing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Wong v. \nUnited States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004). Id. In Wong, the plaintiff’s counsel expressly \n1166\ndisclaimed any challenge to the execution of removal and explained that her claims only \n1177\nimplicated “actions other than that removal, or the commencement of proceedings . . .” 373 \nF.3d at 964 (emphasis original). Thus,  the claims at issue in Wong did not implicate the \n1188\nagency’s prosecutorial discretion and did not pose a threat of “obstruction of the institution \n1199\nof removal proceedings or the execution of removal orders . . .” Id. at 970. Wong is clearly \n2200 distinguishable from the present case in which Plaintiff is directly challenging the decision \nto issue an NTA and thereby terminate DACA, which predicated the commencement of \n2211\nremoval proceedings. As a result, his claims are barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). See Sissoko, \n2222\n509 F.3d at 949.  \n5  To  be  sure,  in  other  contexts,  courts  distinguish  between  discretionary  and \n2233\nnondiscretionary duties. For example, under 5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(1), a plaintiff can assert an \n2244\nAPA claim (akin to a mandamus claim) seeking to compel an agency to perform a duty but \n2255 only if it is a duty compelled by statute (that is, a matter over which the agency has no \ndiscretion). See, e.g., Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710 F.3d 995, 1003 (9th Cir. 2013). Similarly, \n2266\nthere are additional jurisdictional bars contained in different subsections of 8 U.S.C. \n2277 § 1252. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 486 (“[M]any provisions of IIRIRA are aimed at protecting \nthe Executive’s discretion from the courts – indeed, that can fairly be said to be the theme \n2288\nof the legislation.”) (emphasis omitted).  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n14 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.422   Page 24 of 36\n \n11 Cir. 2001) (holding that “a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose \n22 to remove simply by cloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb” or “through the facile \n33 device of re-characterizing” claims to avoid a clear jurisdictional bar). \n44   In sum, regardless of how Plaintiff seeks to frame the issue, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \n55 precludes judicial review of the Government’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. \n66 Accordingly, the decisions of DHS to issue an NTA and place Plaintiff in removal \n77 proceedings, and thereby terminate DACA, are not subject to judicial review, and the \n88 Court should reject Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief.  \n99 ii.  Any viable claims must be channeled through \nPlaintiff’s removal proceedings and not this Court. \n1111\n  To the extent Plaintiff has any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified in 8 U.S.C. \n1122\n§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars him from raising his claims in district court. Under a \n1133\nstatutory scheme designed to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the \n1144\nreview process,” all claims arising from removal proceedings must be raised in \n1155\nimmigration court and channeled through the petition for review process. Aguilar v. \n1166\nImmigration & Customs Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2007). The Ninth Circuit has \n1177\naffirmed this channeling requirement without exception. J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d \n1188\n1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2016). Section 1252(a)(5), entitled “[e]xclusive means of review,” \n1199\nrequires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be \n2200\nthe sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. \n2211\n§ 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and \n2222\nfact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, \n2233\narising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United \n2244\nStates under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order \n2255\nunder this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (emphasis added). \n2266\n  These channeling provisions are not limited to challenges to final orders of removal \n2277\nbut preclude review in district court of “any” challenge “arising from any action” taken to \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n15 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.423   Page 25 of 36\n \n11 remove an alien. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1031. The second sentence of Section \n22 1252(b)(9) explicitly precludes jurisdiction to review (i) orders, “or [(ii)] such questions \n33 of law or fact.” Id. The questions of law and fact described in the preceding sentence \n44 modify those “arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien \n55 from the United States.” Id. Thus, claims arising from “any action taken” to remove an \n66 alien from the United States – including the decision to issue an NTA, a necessary action \n77 towards commencing removal proceedings, and one that terminates DACA – are \n88 channeled through the petition for review process and cannot be brought in federal district \n99 court. To hold otherwise would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from the \n1111 statute. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th \n1122 Cir. 2012) (in the context of an APA claim, ignoring how claim “is framed” for purposes \n1133 of determining whether claim must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n1144 Congress’ intent was simple: if the issue is one that can be raised in removal proceedings, \n1155 and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute precludes district court review). \nSee J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1034 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 173 (statute was \n1166\n“intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal \n1177\nproceeding)); cf. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10 (“Congress plainly intended to put an end to \n1188\nthe scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process. . . .”). \n1199\n  This approach effectuates the general rule precluding simultaneous review of a \n2200\nquestion by both an administrative body and a federal court. See Acura of Bellevue v. \n2211\nReich, 90 F.3d 1403, 1408-9 (9th Cir. 1996). Moreover, there is no “general constitutional \n2222\nright” for an alien to review prosecutorial deliberations in order to avert or prevent \n2233\nremoval proceedings. See Carranza, 277 F.3d at 72, citing AADC, 525 U.S. at 487-92. \n2244\n  Here, Plaintiff challenges the Secretary’s discretionary decision to issue an NTA \n2255\nand thereby terminate his DACA. See Dkt. No. 2-1 at 12 (“USCIS’s decision to terminate \n2266\nhis DACA status automatically—i.e., without considering the basis for the NTA or \n2277\noffering Mr. Gonzalez an opportunity to respond—was both in blatant disregard of \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n16 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.424   Page 26 of 36\n \n11 established procedures for DACA termination and an arbitrary action that flew in the face \n22 of the basic purpose of the DACA program.”). Specifically, Plaintiff argues he has a \n33 constitutional interests in deferred action and in employment authorization that are \n44 protected by due process. Id. at 21-22. But where Plaintiff challenges Defendants’ \n55 exercise of prosecutorial discretion to issue an NTA – a predicate step in commencing \n66 removal proceedings – which has the effect of terminating deferred action and \n77 employment authorization, his challenge necessarily arises from “action taken or \n88 proceedings brought to remove an alien.” See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5); 1252(b)(9). In fact, \n99 he is challenging the very validity of the “proceedings.” See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85 \n1111 (explaining what deferred action is).  \n1122   The Ninth Circuit has made clear that, in the context of a petition for review \n1133 (“PFR”), it may review alleged constitutional violations – which here are insubstantial – \n1144 including claims that were not raised in removal proceedings. See, e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 \n1155 F.3d at 1038 (explaining that, even if never raised in removal proceedings, a court of \nappeals has the authority to resolve questions of constitutional rights); see generally \n1166\nChuyon Yon Hong v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2008) (asserting jurisdiction over \n1177\n“Questions of law, and in particular due process challenges to removal orders”). The \n1188\nNinth Circuit held that taken together, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) “mean that any \n1199\nissue – whether legal or factual – arising from any removal-related activity can be \n2200\nreviewed only through the PFR process.” See id. at 1031 (emphases in original). Plaintiff \n2211\nmay prefer that his constitutional claims be resolved now rather than at a later date, but \n2222\nhis preference provides no basis for this Court to exercise jurisdiction over claims that are \n2233\nsubject to a statutory channeling provision. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1035-36, 1038. \n2244\nThe termination of deferred action due to issuance of an NTA and the \n2255\ncommencement of removal proceedings upon filing of the NTA with the immigration court \n2266\nare two ways of saying the same thing – DHS has decided to take action to remove the \n2277\nalien. By arguing that Plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to deferred action (i.e., that DHS \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n17 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.425   Page 27 of 36\n \n11 must defer acting to remove him) he is, by definition, arguing that DHS is barred from \n22 acting to remove him. Those claims, at least in these circumstances, must be channeled \n33 through petitions for review because Congress imposed significant limitations on aliens’ \n44 ability to challenge decisions and actions related to removal proceedings. See AADC, 525 \n55 U.S. at 485 n.9. \n66 b.  Nothing in the Constitution or APA Establishes a Right that \nConstrains DHS’s Exercise of Discretion. \n77\nEven if this Court finds that the INA’s jurisdiction-stripping and channeling \n88\nprovisions might not preclude review of Plaintiff’s claims, the Court should still deny \n99\nPlaintiff’s motion for emergency relief because Plaintiff’s merits claims fail as a matter \n1111\nof law. Here, Plaintiff can establish neither a constitutional nor an administrative right to \n1122\nreceive any process regarding the termination or denial of DACA because deferred \n1133\naction is necessarily an exercise of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion. Indeed, \n1144\nPlaintiff argues that Defendants’ determinations would be proper if subject to “a process \n1155\nin which USCIS actually exercises its discretion and provides a reasoned explanation \n1166\nthat is based on consideration of relevant factors.” Dkt. No. 2-1 at 18. In fact, DHS \n1177\nacted based on that discretion by issuing an NTA based on factors involving Plaintiff’s \n1188\ncriminality for harboring, which put Plaintiff into removal proceedings and had the \n1199\neffect of terminating his DACA. See Dkt. Nos. 2-16 and 2-17, Pl.’s Exs. M & N. \n2200\ni.  Plaintiff has no Constitutional Interest in Continued \n2211\nDACA or Employment Authorization. \n2222\nHere, Plaintiff asserts both liberty and property interests in the continued receipt \n2233\nof his DACA and seeks procedural due process protections with regard to its \n2244\ntermination. See Dkt. No. 2-1 at 21 (asserting a liberty interest in DACA based on “the \n2255\nassurance not to be apprehended or seek removal of DACA recipients based solely on \n2266\nthe basis of their deferred action); id. (citing Morrisey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) \n2277\n(also alleging that a liberty interest “encompasses the ability to work, raise a family, and \n2288\n‘form the other enduring attachments of life.’”)). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.426   Page 28 of 36\n \n11 To establish a procedural due process interest, a Plaintiff “clearly must have more \n22 than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of \n33 it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Bd. of Regents of State \n44 Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  \n55 1.  Termination of DACA does not Infringe upon an \nEstablished Constitutional Interest. \n66\nFirst, the mere fact that an individual alleges an injury does not result in a loss of \n77\nliberty. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 712 (1976). The cases on which Plaintiff relies to \n88\nsupport an infringement on his liberty interest are inapposite. In Morrissey v. Brewer, \n99\n408 U.S. 471 (1972), the Supreme Court considered the right of parolees to remain at \n1111\nliberty as long as the conditions of parole were not violated. However, Plaintiff cannot \n1122\nallege that his actual liberty is presently at issue. Similarly, while Plaintiff cites \n1133\nMorrisey to discuss “other enduring attachments of life,” Plaintiff purports that such \n1144\nattachments extend to the ability to work and raise a family. See Dkt. No. 2-1 at 21, \n1155\nciting Morrisey, 408 U.S. at 471. Such extension of constitutional interest would \n1166\ndirectly conflict with related rulings.  \n1177\nPlaintiff’s claims regarding the right to raise a family conflict with the Ninth \n1188\nCircuit’s determination that there is no “right to family unity” to reside in the United \n1199\nStates “simply because other members of their family are citizens or lawful permanent \n2200\nresidents.” De Mercado v. Mukasey, 566 F.3d 810, 816 (9th Cir. 2009). The same goes \n2211\nfor the right of aliens to work in the United States without authorization. See Pilapil v. \n2222\nINS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970), cert denied, 400 U.S. 908 (1970); WJA Realty Ltd. \n2233\nP’ship v. Nelson, 708 F. Supp. 1268, 1273 (S.D. Fla. 1989) (holding that noncitizens do \n2244\nnot have a constitutional right to work without authorization). Thus, there is no judicial \n2255\nreview of the decision to terminate work authorization. See Perales v. Casillas, 903 \n2266\nF.2d 1043, 1047-48 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[T]here is nothing in the [INA] expressly \n2277\nproviding for the grant of employment authorization . . . . to aliens who are the \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n19 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.427   Page 29 of 36\n \n11 beneficiaries of approved petitions”) (vacating the challenged portion of the injunction); \n22 see, e.g., Kaddoura v. Gonzales, No. C06-1402 RSL, 2007 WL 1521218, at *4-5 (W.D. \n33 Wash. May 21, 2007) (finding a lack of judicial review). As a matter of law, a plaintiff \n44 cannot assert an established constitutional right to DACA or work authorization.  \n55 2.  Termination of DACA does not Infringe upon a \nConstitutional Interest based on Entitlement. \n66\n“To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an \n77\nabstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He \n88\nmust, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. \n99\n& Rehab., 727 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 577); see also \n1111\nMendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 (9th Cir. 2016) (underscoring that aliens \n1122\ncannot claim a cognizable due process interest in discretionary immigration relief or \n1133\nbenefits); Tefel v. Reno, 180 F.3d 1286, 1301 (11th Cir. 1999) (“awarding and then \n1144\nrevoking discretionary relief does not offend due process”). A property interest subject to \n1155\nprocedural due process protection may arise where such interest is secured by “existing \n1166\nrules or understandings that stem from an independent source . . . .” Roth, 408 U.S. at \n1177\n577. The independent source can be a statute, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 572-73 \n1188\n(1975); a regulation, see Glenn v. Newman, 614 F.2d 467, 471-72 (5th Cir. 1980), \n1199\noverruled on other grounds by Shearer v. Bowen, 216 F.3d 1080 (5th Cir. 2000); an \n2200\nexpress or implied contract, see Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601-02 (1972); or a \n2211\nmutually explicit understanding. Id. at 602-03. In a pair of companion cases handed down \n2222\nthe same day, the Supreme Court explained that “government employees can have a \n2233\nprotected property interest in their continued employment if they have a legitimate claim \n2244\nto tenure or if the terms of the employment make it clear that the employee can be fired \n2255\nonly for cause.” Blantz, 727 F.3d at 922-23 (comparing Roth, 408 U.S. 576-78, with \n2266\nPerry, 408 U.S. at 599-603). \n2277\n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n20 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.428   Page 30 of 36\n \n11 For example, when a professor sued for deprivation of property without due \n22 process after his employment contract was not renewed, the Court found that the \n33 professor lacked a protected property interest in his continued employment because his \n44 employment contract was for a fixed one-year term. Blantz, 727 F.3d at 922-23 (citing \n55 Roth, 408 U.S. at 566). Similarly, when a nurse sued over her termination, relying on \n66 orientation documents that stated “termination can occur as a result of the performance \n77 review procedures” detailed in the document, the Ninth Circuit concluded she lacked a \n88 property interest in her continued employment because the documents “do not guarantee \n99 that every termination must be preceded by a peer review process or any other specified \n1111 departmental procedures.” Id. at 924.  \n1122   Similarly, nothing in the DACA memoranda, public Q&A, or the DACA SOP \n1133 indicate any promise of benefits or entitlement to initial or continuing deferred action or \n1144 DACA-based employment authorization. See, e.g., Dkt. 2-11, Pl.’s Ex. H (USCIS FAQ) \n1155 (“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be \nterminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \n1166\ndiscretion.”). Here, the DACA guidance and policies made clear that a recipient of \n1177\nDACA has no constitutionally protected interest in the continuation of DACA or a \n1188\nconstitutionally protected interest in notice prior to termination. Specifically, the 2012 \n1199\nMemorandum states, “[t]his memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration \n2200\nstatus or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative \n2211\nauthority, can confer these rights.” Dkt. No. 2-5, Pl.’s Ex. B at 3. In addition, the USCIS \n2222\nFAQs specifically state that deferred action can be terminated before it expires, \n2233\nexplaining, “DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may \n2244\nbe terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \n2255\ndiscretion.” Dkt. No. 2-11, Pl.’s Ex. H at Q27. The USCIS FAQs further explain that \n2266\nthe phrase “national security or public safety threat” includes but is not limited to “gang \n2277\nmembership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n21 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.429   Page 31 of 36\n \n11 threaten the United States.” See id. at Q:65.6 Reading these documents in context, a \n22 DACA recipient does not have a protected property interest in the continuation of his or \n33 her DACA or DACA-based employment authorization. See, e.g., Gerhart v. Lake Cnty., \n44 Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2011) (“A person’s belief of entitlement to a \n55 government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably held, does not create a \n66 property right if that belief is not mutually held by the government. The Supreme Court \n77 has explained, ‘[a] constitutional entitlement cannot be created—as if by estoppel—\n88 merely because a wholly and expressly discretionary state privilege has been granted \n99 generously in the past.’ We have similarly held that a government body’s past practice \n1111 of granting a government benefit is insufficient to establish a legal entitlement to the \n1122 benefit.” (quoting Conn. Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 465 (1981)) \n1133 (citations omitted); Plaza Health Labs., Inc. v. Perales, 878 F.2d 577, 581 (2d Cir. \n1144 1989) (observing that, for due process purposes, “the existence of provisions that retain \n1155 for the [government] significant discretionary authority over the bestowal or \ncontinuation of a government benefit suggests that the recipients of such benefits have \n1166\nno entitlement to them”). These policies and guidance are consistent with longstanding \n1177\nauthority regarding the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the context of \n1188\nimmigration law. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 (recognizing that deferred action is a \n1199\n“commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without express \n2200\nstatutory authorization”). Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion for \n2211\nemergency relief because his claims fail as a matter of law. \n2222\n \n2233\n// \n \n2244\n//   \n2255\n2266\n                                                 \n2277 6 Although criminal activity “can” result in termination, it is not the case that “every \ntermination must be preceded” by criminal activity. See Blantz, 727 F.3d at 924. The \n2288\nGovernment retains the discretion to terminate DACA for other reasons.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n22 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.430   Page 32 of 36\n \nii.  The APA Affords Plaintiff no Actionable Interest \n11\nRegarding the Termination of DACA or \n22 Employment Authorization. \n33 Assuming jurisdiction arguendo, there is no basis to conclude that Defendants \n44 are required to provide notice to a DACA recipient before issuing an NTA that \n55 terminates DACA, or to issue a notice of the termination of that DACA. The USCIS \n66 FAQ specifically states that DACA “may be terminated at any time, with or without a \n77 Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.” Dkt. No. 2-11, Pl.’s Ex. H at \n88 Q:27. Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions, DHS procedural guidance provides for \n99 termination of deferred action without issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate or \n1111 providing a chance to respond. See Dkt. No. 2-9, Pl.’s Ex. F and Exhibit B.  \n1122   For example, where CBP or ICE issues a Notice to Appear, the DACA guidance \n1133 provides that DACA terminates automatically. Per Appendix I, the related Employment \n1144 Authorization Document terminates when removal proceedings are initiated, which were \n1155 triggered here by the notice. Def.’s Ex. B; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii), (2). CBP or ICE \n1166 may decide to issue an NTA, among other reasons, where there is a disqualifying criminal \n1177 offense or public safety concern, and USCIS will generally issue a Notice of Action \n1188 informing the individual that his DACA and Employment Authorization Document \n1199 terminated automatically due to the NTA. Def.’s Ex. B at 2 (“On [Date NTA served on \n2200 alien], [ICE] issued you a Notice to Appear (NTA). . . . USCIS is notifying you that your \n2211 deferred action as a childhood arrival and your employment authorization terminated \n2222 automatically as of the date your NTA was issued.”). The determination to issue the NTA \n2233 remains within the discretion of the agency. 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a) (“Any immigration \n2244 officer, or supervisor thereof, performing an inspection of an arriving alien at a port-of-\n2255 entry may issue a notice to appear to such alien.”); see, e.g., Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, \n2266 727 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 2013) (discussing historic roots of this discretion). \n2277   Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant’s internal procedures require notice and an \n2288 opportunity to respond in every DACA termination is incorrect, and it is based on a \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.431   Page 33 of 36\n \n11 selective reading of those procedures. Dkt. No. 2-1 at 5-6, 12-14 (alleging Defendants \n22 acted in violation of the Accardi doctrine because they failed to adhere to their own \n33 internal operating procedures.) Here, Defendants obtained information through Plaintiff’s \n44 arrest and detention process, including interviews with other unlawfully present aliens \n55 hiding in the attic of the house where Plaintiff was arrested, which suggested to \n66 Defendants that Plaintiff was involved in a human smuggling operation. Exs. D and E. \n77 That information led to the discretionary determination to issue an NTA, which \n88 simultaneously terminated Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD. See Dkt. No. 2-16, Pl.’s Ex. M; \n99 Dkt. No. 2-17, Pl.’s Ex. N. The Notice of Action that Plaintiff received following the \n1111 NTA was drawn directly from Appendix I of the DACA SOP. See Def.’s Ex. B at 2. \n1122 Criminal activity that is considered a national security or public safety concern, even \n1133 without a conviction, is a basis for NTA issuance and resultant DACA termination.  See, \n1144 e.g., Dkt. No. 2-10, Pl.’s Ex.G (investigation and/or arrest for human smuggling makes an \n1155 unlawful immigrant “a top immigration enforcement priority.”). Defendants, therefore, \nexercised their discretion to initiate removal proceedings against Plaintiff by issuing an \n1166\nNTA. As prescribed in Chapter 14 and Appendix I of the DACA SOP, the issuance of the \n1177\nNTA immediately terminated Plaintiff’s DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity \n1188\nto respond required. Per Appendix I, the NTA also terminated Plaintiff’s employment \n1199\nauthorization. Thus, Plaintiff has no basis to rely on the Accardi doctrine, which requires \n2200\nan agency to comply with its own regulations, to allege a violation of internal operating \n2211\nprocedures.  \n2222\n  Additionally, courts have declined to apply the Accardi doctrine in matters of \n2233\nprosecutorial discretion. See Carranza, 277 F.3d at 72-73 (declining to apply Accardi \n2244\ndoctrine in habeas challenge to alleged “failure of the INS to exercise individualized \n2255\ndiscretion in its decision to initiate deportation proceedings,” observing that “[w]hether or \n2266\nnot the INS exercised its discretion is therefore beside any relevant point” as “petitioner \n2277\ndid not have a right to demand the exercise of this discretion in the first place”); United \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n24 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.432   Page 34 of 36\n \n11 States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485, 492-93 (8th Cir. 2001) (“Courts have agreed that individuals \n22 have no enforceable rights under another internal DOJ policy known as the Petite policy, \n33 which restricts federal prosecution of individuals already prosecuted under state law for \n44 the same act or acts. Prosecutorial discretion has been treated differently than other types \n55 of agency discretion, and the special nature of prosecution is the reason that the Accardi \n66 doctrine has not been applied to criminal law enforcement policies and procedures.”). The \n77 Accardi doctrine is also inapplicable in the context of internal operating guidelines that \n88 preserve the exercise of agency discretion. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, \n99 1009 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding amended Operating Instructions were “general statements of \n1111 policy” because the instructions preserved the agency’s flexibility and opportunity to \n1122 make discretionary determinations); id. (“a directive must not establish a binding norm \n1133 and must leave agency officials free to consider the individual facts in the various cases \n1144 that arise and to exercise discretion”) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Thus, the \n1155 Court should deny Plaintiff’s requested relief because there is no basis to conclude that \nDefendants are required to provide notice to a DACA recipient before issuing an NTA or \n1166\nto issue a notice of the termination of that DACA.   \n1177\n1188 C.  The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors Favor Defendants. \n  Where the Government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \n1199\ninterest factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). Defendants have strong \n2200\ninterests in enforcing U.S. immigration laws effectively and consistent with the statutory \n2211\nremoval scheme. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 490 (“There is always a public interest in prompt \n2222\nexecution of removal orders: The continued presence of an alien lawfully deemed \n2233\nremovable undermines the streamlined removal proceedings IIRIRA established, and \n2244\n“permit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States law.”). These interests \n2255\noutweigh the harms alleged by Plaintiff, especially considering the amount of time that \n2266\nhas passed since Defendants first terminated Plaintiff’s DACA and began removal \n2277\nproceedings. For these additional reasons, Plaintiff’s motion should be denied. \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n25 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 9   Filed 09/21/17   PageID.433   Page 35 of 36\n \nDated: September 21, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n11\n \n22 CHAD A.

Introduction \n22   Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint challenges U.S. Citizenship and \n33 Immigration Services’ (“USCIS”) discretionary termination of his DACA and \n44 employment authorization after notice and an opportunity respond. Plaintiff now seeks an \n55 injunction setting aside Defendants’ termination of Plaintiff’s DACA, and subsequent \n66 denial of his DACA renewal request. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 30. \n77   The Court must deny Plaintiff’s motion because the Court should not allow \n88 Plaintiff to overturn, even temporarily, a decision clearly based in Defendants’ discretion, \n99 exercised in a manner that is fully compliant with Defendants’ established procedures. \n1111 Nor should the Court recognize constitutional rights where none exist. This Court lacks \n1122 jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims because: the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) \n1133 precludes review over Defendants’ decision and actions regarding the adjudication of \n1144 Plaintiff’s removal proceedings – including the termination of DACA – and any claims \n1155 the INA preserves for review must be channeled through Plaintiff’s removal proceedings; \n1166 Defendants’ exercise of prosecutorial discretion is not appropriate for judicial review; and \n1177 the Plaintiff cannot establish a constitutional interest sufficient to proceed on his Due \n1188 Process claims. Even were the Court to find jurisdiction, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a \n1199 likelihood of success on the merits because the process Defendant received and the \n2200 ultimate decision terminating his DACA were fully compliant with the U.S. Constitution \n2211 and administrative process. A decision granting Plaintiff the relief he seeks would be \n2222 tantamount to a finding that Defendants lack the discretion to terminate Plaintiff’s DACA \n2233 – a proposition that is both unsupported by the corresponding agency guidance, and is \n2244 also contrary to Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent. \nII.  Background \n2255\nHere, as a result of the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order, USCIS reinstated \n2266\nPlaintiff’s DACA, accepted his DACA renewal request, issued Plaintiff a Notice of Intent \n2277\nto Terminate (NOIT) his reinstated DACA, Dkt. Nos. 14-1 & 14-2; Dkt. No. 39-6 at 191-\n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1252   Page 13 of 37\n \n11 192, and have now issued a Termination Decision (“Decision”) that will terminate \n22 Plaintiff’s DACA as of December 21, 2017, upon further order of this Court. See Dkt. \n33 No. 39-6 at 194-197. That Decision specifically referenced the DACA SOP, Dkt. No. 39-\n44 6 at 195 (“If after consulting with ICE, USCIS determines that exercising prosecutorial \n55 discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with the \n66 Department of Homeland Security's enforcement priorities . . . .”), quoting Dkt. No. 2-9 \n77 at 15, and goes on to consider Plaintiff’s arguments in response to USCIS’s NOIT before \n88 concluding, the agency’s discretion, that termination of DACA is warranted.  \n99 ARGUMENT \n1111 I.  Standards of Review \n1122 “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \n1133 positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Texas v. \n1144 Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). As a result, it is generally inappropriate at the \n1155 “preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.” Id.; see Senate of \n1166 State of Cal. v. Mosbacher, 968 F.2d 974, 978 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that “judgment on \n1177 the merits in the guise of preliminary relief is a highly inappropriate result”). \n1188   A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish” that: (1) it is likely to \n1199 succeed on the merits of its claims; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \n2200 preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in \n2211 the public interest. Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Preliminary \n2222 injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right, id. at 20, and the \n2233 party seeking such relief bears the burden of establishing the prerequisites to this \n2244 extraordinary remedy. Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). \n2255 Alternatively, a party must show “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship \n2266 balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff,” as well as a likelihood of irreparable harm, \n2277 and that the injunction is in the public interest. Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, \n2288 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011). Showing “serious questions going to the merits” \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1253   Page 14 of 37\n \n11 requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a “substantial case for relief on the merits.” Leiva-\n22 Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n33\nIII.  Plaintiff Cannot Sustain the Requirements for Injunctive Relief. \n44\nA. Plaintiff is not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n55\nWhether viewed as a preliminary or permanent injunction, the Court cannot grant \n66\nPlaintiff relief because he cannot succeed on the merits. This Court lacks jurisdiction to \n77\nreview Defendant’s discretionary determination to terminate Plaintiff’s DACA. Additionally, \n88\nnothing in the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) or constitutional jurisprudence \n99\nestablishes a right to review or constrain DHS’s exercise of discretion or to grant Plaintiff \n1111\nprocedural rights other than those available to him through his removal proceedings. \n1122\n1.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction, and any Judicial Challenges to Removal \n1133 Must be Brought in a Petition for Review. \nThe APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial review in \n1144\nfederal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. A \n1155\nreviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n1166\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or “without observance of procedure \n1177\nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). However, the APA precludes judicial review of \n1188\nagency decisions when “statutes preclude judicial review,” or when the decision is “committed \n1199\nto agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), (a)(2); see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n2200\n830 (1985) (explaining that “even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, \n2211\nreview is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard \n2222\nagainst which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.”).  \n2233\nCongress enacted section 1252(g) to specifically preclude judicial review of the \n2244\ndiscretionary decision to initiate removal proceedings, and the actions and decisions arising out \n2255\nof such decisions. See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, \n2266\n483-85 (1999) (finding section 1252(g) also precludes review of the discretionary decision to \n2277\nnot initiate removal proceedings). Furthermore, in Heckler, the Supreme Court held that “an \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1254   Page 15 of 37\n \n11 agency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from \n22 judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” 470 U.S. 821, 832.  \n33 Here, the INA specifically precludes review of the actions that Plaintiff challenges. \n44 Moreover, the challenged action, an individual DACA decision, falls squarely within that \n55 category of actions for which there is no law to apply like: decision implicating \n66 prosecutorial discretion. See Heckler, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, \n77 824 F.3d 822, 828 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is \n88 a type of government action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial \n99 intervention”); accord Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (explaining that \n1111 “[i]n making immigration enforcement decisions, the executive considers a variety of \n1122 factors”), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 900, (2016), reh’g denied, 136 S. Ct. 1250 (2016). \n1133 Contrary to Plaintiff’s arguments, Defendants’ guidance does not curtail the well-\n1144 recognized discretion with regard to deferred action decisions. \n1155 Additionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s constitutional claims \nbecause Plaintiff necessarily lacks a protected constitutional interest in the DACA \n1166\ntermination process, because the ultimate relief he seeks – deferred action – is \n1177\ndiscretionary. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  \n1188\n1199 a.  The INA Limits Review of Plaintiff’s Claims which Arise from \nDHS’s Decision to Commence and Adjudicate Plaintiff’s \n2200\nRemoval Proceedings. \n2211\nThrough the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005 and codified at 8 \n2222\nU.S.C. § 1252(g), Congress explicitly eliminated judicial review over “any cause or claim \n2233\nby or on behalf of any alien . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to commence \n2244\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this \n2255\nchapter.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Section 1252(g) was “directed against a particular evil: \n2266\nattempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” AADC, 525 U.S. at \n2277\n485 n.9; cf. Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (rejecting contention \n2288\nthat section 1252(g) applies only to discretionary decisions of the Secretary).  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1255   Page 16 of 37\n \n11 The fact that Plaintiff frames his claim as a challenge to a DACA determination \n22 rather than expressly requesting the enjoining of adjudication of his removal proceedings \n33 is irrelevant because section 1252(g) precludes judicial review of “any” claim “arising” \n44 from “the decision or action” to adjudicate cases (not just express challenges to the \n55 adjudication itself). See, e.g., Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004) \n66 (finding review of the reopening of removal proceedings, but not the administrative \n77 closure of proceedings, was barred from review as an action related to the decision to \n88 commence removal); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing AADC, \n99 525 U.S. at 944 (discussing the scope of section 1252(g) as including “various decisions . \n1111 . . leading up to order consequent upon final orders of deportation.”)). \n1122 Additionally, the Court should reject, as contrary to section 1252(g), Plaintiff’s \n1133 contention that he is challenging the Government’s decision-making process rather than \n1144 the final decision itself. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 17. Section 1252(g) is not limited to claims \n1155 arising from the adjudication of cases or that his claims nor is it limited to only \ndiscretionary actions. Cf. Silva, 866 F.3d at 940. Defendants disagree with the Court’s \n1166\nprior citation to United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004), for the \n1177\nproposition that judicial review is preserved for purely legal conclusions. Dkt. No. 12 at \n1188\n8. There, the Ninth Circuit held that section 1252(g) did not apply because “the gravamen \n1199\nof [the alien’s] claim does not arise from the Attorney General’s decision or action to \n2200\ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.” Hovsepian, 359 \n2211\nF.3d at 1155 (9th Cir. 2004).1 Additionally, Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328 (N.D. \n2222\nGa. June 12, 2017), is of no assistance here. There, the court noted that section 1252(g) \n2233\n2244\n2255\n                                                 \n2266 1 Hovsepian considered a purely legal question preceding a discretionary decision. Here, however, the \nDACA SOP identifies threshold criteria for DACA consideration, but it does not mandate granting DACA \n2277\nif those threshold criteria are met. See DACA SOP Chapter 8 at 45 (April 2013 version) (“Individuals may \n2288 be considered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”), available at \nhttps://cliniclegal.org/sites/default/files/attachments/daca_sop_4-4-13.pdf (last visited Feb. 5, 2018). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1256   Page 17 of 37\n \n11 eliminates “jurisdiction to review the government’s ultimate discretionary determination \n22 as to Plaintiff’s DACA [ ].” Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1339 (citations omitted). \n33 Moreover, Plaintiff’s claim that constitutional claims are preserved \n44 notwithstanding section 1252(g) similarly fails. See Dkt. No. 39-1 at 17. On this point, \n55 the Court’s prior reliance on Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2003), is \n66 also misplaced. See Dkt. No. 12 at 8. There, the Ninth Circuit did not even consider \n77 section 1252(g) and analyzed only the jurisdiction limitation statute at section \n88 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) holding that “[w]hether the BIA’s interpretation of the hardship standard \n99 violates due process is not a “judgment regarding the granting of” cancellation of \n1111 removal relief.” Ramirez-Perez, 336 F.3d at 1005. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit has held \n1122 that “a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by \n1133 cloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb.” See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, \n1144 1271 (9th Cir. 2001). And, even for a court to find that section 1252(g) does not preclude \n1155 review of constitutional claims, those claims must “not arise from ‘a decision or Action \nby the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal \n1166\norders against any alien,’ but instead constitute ‘general collateral challenges to \n1177\nunconstitutional practices and policies used by the agency.’” Walter v. Reno, 145 F.3d \n1188\n1032, 1052 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting McNary v. Haitian Refugee Cir., Inc., 498 U.S. 479 \n1199\n(1991)). Rather, claims that fall within the limitations of section 1252(g) are not subject \n2200\nto review, even if cast as constitutional claims. See Sissoko v.

United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004). In \nWong, plaintiff’s counsel expressly disclaimed any challenge to the execution of removal and explained \n2266\nthat her claims only implicated “actions other than that removal, or the commencement of proceedings . . \n.,” 373 F.3d at 964, for which the court held that the claims at issue in Wong did not implicate the agency’s \n2277\nprosecutorial discretion and did not pose a threat of “obstruction of the institution of removal proceedings \n2288 or the execution of removal orders . . . .” Id. at 970. Wong is distinguishable where Plaintiff is in removal \nproceedings and DACA termination could have a direct result in his removal from the United States.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1257   Page 18 of 37\n \n11 Courts have held that section 1252(g) applies to bar jurisdiction over DACA \n22 determinations. See Garcia-Herrera v. Asher, 585 F. App’x 439, 440 (9th Cir. 2014) \n33 (holding under section 1252(g) that petitioner’s challenge to ICE’s decision not to delay \n44 his removal proceeding pending the adjudication of his DACA request constituted a \n55 challenge to ICE’s decision to execute a removal order); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x \n66 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016) (finding no jurisdiction to review a denial of a DACA request \n77 because “that decision involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a \n88 deferred action.”); see also Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir. 2012) \n99 (“[W]e lack jurisdiction to review petitioners’ contention that the agency abused its \n1111 discretion in denying the motion to reopen to seek prosecutorial discretion based on the \n1122 recent order of President Obama.”); Rodriguez v. Sessions, No. 15-72487, 2017 WL \n1133 695192, at *1 (9th Cir. Feb. 22, 2017); Fabian-Lopez v. Holder, No. 11-71513, 540 F. \n1144 App’x 760, 761 n.2 (9th Cir. Apr. 29, 2013); cf. Sanchez v. Holder, No. 15CV0089-GPC \n1155 WVG, 2015 WL 4249446 (S.D. Cal. July 13, 2015) (district court lacked jurisdiction to \nstay removal and make determination on deferred action eligibility). \n1166\nThis recent authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 \n1177\nOperating Instructions, a previous policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of \n1188\ndeferred action.  That authority concluded that district courts lack jurisdiction to review \n1199\nthe district director’s decision not to recommend deferred action. Romeiro de Silva v. \n2200\nSmith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985). Plaintiff ignores that holding and instead \n2211\nrelies on Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979) for the purported reviewability of \n2222\nan internal deferred action policy with “‘express criteria’ and ‘periodic review of non-\n2233\npriority status’ [that] ‘clearly and directly affects substantive rights,’ including ‘the ability \n2244\nof an individual subject to its provisions to continue residence in the United States.’” Dkt. \n2255\nNo. 39-1, citing Nicholas, 590 F.2d at 807-08.3 There, the Ninth Circuit held that the five \n2266\n                                                 \n2277\n3 Notably, even in Nicholas, the Court ultimately denied the appeal on Nicholas’ claim to eligibility for \n2288 non-priority status as defined in the INS’s 1978 Operating Instructions because he could not meet his \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1258   Page 19 of 37\n \n11 express humanitarian factors in the 1978 Operating Instructions,4 the effect of a grant of \n22 such non-priority status to provide an indefinite delay in deportation, and the directive \n33 nature of the language (“‘In Every case’” where relief is appropriate, the District Director \n44 ‘Shall recommend’ deferred action category”), made it “obvious that this procedure exists \n55 out of consideration for the convenience of the petitioner, and not that of the INS.” Id. at \n66 806-07. While the Ninth Circuit considered periodic review an important factor, it \n77 conditioned its analysis in consideration that “the Instruction plainly contemplates a \n88 scheme where the status would preclude any deportation as long as the relevant \n99 humanitarian factors are still compelling, rather than being subject to termination at the \n1111 convenience of the INS.” Id. at 807. \n1122 In contrast to Nicholas, Romeiro de Silva’s request for deferred action was denied \n1133 after “[t]he INS district director considered each of these factors.” Romeiro de Silva, 773 \n1144 F.2d at 1023. The Ninth Circuit, however, acknowledged the weight of authority finding \n1155 that deferred action determinations under the 1978 operating instructions unreviewable, \nand held that under the 1981 Operating Instructions “the district court lacked jurisdiction \n1166\nto review the district director’s decision not to recommend deferred action status for \n1177\nRomeiro de Silva,” because “it is no longer possible to conclude that [the instruction] is \n1188\nintended to confer any benefit upon aliens, rather than [to operate] merely for the INS’s \n1199\nown convenience.” Id. at 1024-25.  \n2200\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in AADC held that section 1252(g) applied to bar \n2211\nthese same types deferred action determinations. AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-87 (“At each \n2222\n2233\n                                                 \nburden to show that the Government’s decision “deviated from an established pattern without reason” \n2244\nnotwithstanding the presence of humanitarian factors. 590 F.2d at 808. Nicholas’s request was verbally \n2255 denied, apparently without further explanation or process. Id. at 804.  \n \n2266 4 “When determining whether a case should be recommended for deferred action category, consideration \nshould include the following: (1) advanced or tender age; (2) many years’ presence in the United States; \n2277\n(3) physical or mental condition requiring care or treatment in the United States; (4) family situation in \n2288 the United States effect of expulsion; (5) criminal, immoral, or subversive activities or affiliations recent \nconduct.” Nicholas, 590 F.2d at 806-807, citing 1978 INS Operating Instruction at 103.1(a)(1)(ii). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1259   Page 20 of 37\n \n11 stage the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor, and at the time IIRIRA was \n22 enacted the INS had been engaging in a regular practice (which had come to be known as \n33 “deferred action”) of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its \n44 own convenience.”). There, the Government ended prior grants of deferred action by \n55 charging, and then pursuing deportation for only routine status violations against six of \n66 the eight plaintiffs. Id. at 474. Importantly, the Court held that aliens unlawfully in the \n77 United States and subject to deferred action had “no constitutional right to assert selective \n88 enforcement as a defense against his deportation,” under the First or Fifth Amendments \n99 to the U.S. Constitution. Id. at 489. \n1111 Here, the similarities to both the policies and procedures addressed by the Ninth \n1122 Circuit and Supreme Court are too strong for the Court to reason around Congress’s clear \n1133 intent. Plaintiff’s claims are barred by section 1252(g) because he is asserting claims \n1144 arising from the commencement of and adjudication of his removal proceedings. Because \n1155 Plaintiff claims that it was improper for DHS to terminate his DACA because “ICE’s \nlitigation of removal proceedings for unlawful presence against a DACA recipient was \n1166\nnot a valid basis for USCIS to terminate DACA under the SOP,” and “removal from the \n1177\ncountry in the absence of any culpability would visit such grievous harm,” Dkt. No. 38 at \n1188\n¶¶ 136; 14, he is necessarily challenging the “commencement” and “adjudicat[ion]” of \n1199\nhis ongoing removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Indeed, because the denial of \n2200\nDACA is a step “leading up to” a final order of removal, it is squarely within the scope of \n2211\nsection 1252(g). Id. Plaintiff’s effort to shroud his claims in procedural terms is further \n2222\nundone by his challenge to ICE’s identification of Plaintiff as a removal priority and \n2233\ndecision to pursue his removal because “[o]nly individuals who do not qualify for DACA \n2244\nstatus may be considered enforcement priorities [based on the Kelly Memo].” Dkt. No. \n2255\n38 ¶ 169. Finally, were the Court to find that a final removal against Plaintiff could not be \n2266\nexecuted based in some way on his claimed entitlement to DACA, then the issues raised \n2277\nhere are certainly those for which this Court lacks jurisdiction.  \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1260   Page 21 of 37\n \n11 Regardless of how Plaintiff frames the issue, section 1252(g) precludes judicial \n22 review of the Government’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. Accordingly, the \n33 decisions of DHS to issue an NTA and place Plaintiff in removal proceedings, and thereby \n44 terminate DACA, and subsequent decision to terminate Plaintiff’s DACA following advance \n55 notice and an opportunity to respond are not subject to judicial review, and the Court should \n66 reject Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief. To hold otherwise would render section \n77 1252(g) a dead letter because any individual could seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge \n88 the commencement of removal proceedings through this type of creative pleading. \n99 To the extent that Plaintiff has any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified at 8 \n1111 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars him from raising those claims in district court, \n1122 even before a final order of removal issues. Section 1252(a)(5), entitled “[e]xclusive \n1133 means of review,” requires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of \n1144 appeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of \n1155 removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides “[j]udicial review of \nall questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional \n1166\nand statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove \n1177\nan alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial \n1188\nreview of a final order under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (emphasis added); see, \n1199\ne.g., J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1038 (9th Cir. 2016) (district court lacked \n2200\njurisdiction over challenge to adequacy of removal procedures, and instead court of \n2211\nappeals has authority to resolve questions of constitutional rights on review of a final \n2222\nremoval order).  \n2233\nSection 1252(b)(9) is “a clear statutory prescription against district court review” \n2244\nof challenges arising from removal proceedings for plaintiffs who had not yet received \n2255\nfinal orders of removal. J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1035-38. While the Court acknowledged \n2266\nthat “an unrepresented minor in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult \n2277\nsituation,” it also found “these considerations cannot overcome a clear statutory \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1261   Page 22 of 37\n \n11 prescription against district court review. Relief is through review in the court of appeals \n22 or executive or congressional action.” Id. at 1036-38.5   \n33 Here, Plaintiff challenges the Secretary’s discretion to terminate DACA following \n44 the decision to issue Plaintiff an NTA. See Dkt. No. 39-1 at 1-2; Dkt. 38 ¶¶ 136; 14. Thus, \n55 Plaintiff’s challenge necessarily arises from “action taken or proceedings brought to \n66 remove an alien,” for which district courts lack jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court \n77 should find that Plaintiff cannot show either a likelihood of success or that the law and \n88 facts clearly favor his position. Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \nb. Judicial Review of DACA Termination Based on NTA Issuance is \n99\nalso Barred under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).   \n1111\nThere is no judicial review under the APA of decisions that “courts traditionally \n1122\nhave regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n1133\n(1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). These decisions are typically unreviewable \n1144\nbecause there exists “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n1155\nexercise of discretion.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985). This bar applies \n1166\neven when “the agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.” \n1177\nICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987) (“BLE”). The decisions \n1188\ncommitted to executive discretion include “an agency’s exercise of enforcement power,” \n1199\nincluding resource allocation and overall priorities. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. As there is \n2200\n“no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in \n2211\nweighing these factors, an agency’s exercise of enforcement powers is “presumed \n2222\nimmune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” Id. at 830, 832.  \n2233\n                                                 \n2244 5 The Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), is misplaced. Dkt. No. \n31 at 7. Singh challenged ineffective assistance of counsel through habeas, and the court held that section \n2255\n1252(b)(9) did not apply because the challenge was not tied to removal proceedings. Singh, 499 F.3d at \n2266 978-79. To interpret Singh as permitting district court challenges such as those raised here runs counter to \nCongressional intent, and would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from the statute. See \n2277 Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (an APA claim \n“challeng[ing] the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably linked’ to the \n2288\norder of removal” must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n11 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1262   Page 23 of 37\n \n11 Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” presumptively “rests entirely in \n22 [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) \n33 (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil enforcement action is generally \n44 not open to judicial scrutiny. Considerations such as the Chaney factors are equally \n55 present in enforcement decisions as in nonenforcement decisions. See Chaney, 470 U.S. \n66 at 831; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-8 (1985) (“[T]he decision to \n77 prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). \n88 One form of that broad discretion is deferred action, a “discretionary and \n99 reversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek his removal for a \n1111 specific period of time. Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Like other \n1122 agency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing \n1133 of policy considerations that cannot serve as “meaningful standard against which to judge \n1144 the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The converse is equally \n1155 true: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency discretion. See AADC, 525 \nU.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”). \n1166\nBecause “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in this \n1177\ncountry” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which \n1188\njudges may patrol its exercise.” Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) \n1199\n(INS’s decision not to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to \n2200\na group of aliens was non-justiciable). Thus, individual DACA terminations fall squarely \n2211\nwithin that category of agency discretion for which judicial review is improper. See \n2222\nChaney, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales, 824 F.3d at 822 (explaining that the exercise \n2233\nof prosecutorial discretion is different from other types of agency action). \n2244\nHere, Plaintiff is challenging DHS’s exercise of its enforcement power, including \n2255\nspecifically the factors it relied on, and argues that instead of seeking to remove him from \n2266\nthis country, DHS should decide to continue to defer action with respect to him. See, e.g., \n2277\nDkt. No. 39-1 at 20 (“Defendants have applied the non-DACA definition of ‘enforcement \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n12 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1263   Page 24 of 37\n \n11 priority’ to a DACA recipient;”) Id. at 26 (“DACA termination threatens to completely \n22 deprive him, inter alia, of his basic ability to remain in the only country he has ever \n33 called home.”). This is a classic challenge to DHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial \n44 discretion. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. There is no meaningful standard to judge \n55 whether DHS should continue to defer action as to Plaintiff and, instead, prioritize the \n66 removal of other aliens. See id.6 Indeed, Plaintiff’s tortured reading of the DACA SOP \n77 along with the Kelly Memo would render meaningless the specific termination ground \n88 that continuation of deferred action is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities. \n99 See Dkt. No. 39-1 at 19-22. Rather, this type of enforcement decision involves a \n1111 balancing of factors, including factors as to how to allocate agency resources, that is \n1122 committed to agency discretion by law. See id., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. The question \n1133 for DHS was not whether it could continue to exercise its discretion in favor of the \n1144 Plaintiff, but rather whether it should have under the circumstances of this case. Because \n1155 this type of discretionary determination is committed to DHS by law, this Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Plaintiff’s claims. \n1166\n1177 c.  Plaintiff Cannot State a Constitutional Claim because the \nTermination of DACA and Employment Authorizations does not \n1188\nImplicate a Constitutional Interest. \n1199\nPlaintiffs cannot have a protected constitutional interest in DACA because it purely \n2200\ndiscretionary.  See, e.g., Velasco-Gutierrez v. Crossland, 732 F.2d 792, 798 (10th Cir. \n2211\n1984) (holding that deferred action guidance “places no effective limitations on official \n2222\ndiscretion, and thus creates no protected liberty interest in deferred action”); cf. Arpaio, \n2233\n797 F.3d at 17 (quoting DACA Memo for the proposition that “deferred action remains \n2244\n                                                 \n2255 6 It is irrelevant for this Court’s jurisdiction that DHS has guidance regarding grants of deferred action \nunder DACA. The existence of criteria that an agency is to consider is not enough to provide a meaningful \n2266\nstandard of review, see Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 659 (11th Cir. 1983), and, moreover, the exercise \nof prosecutorial discretion is not amenable to judicial review even when an agency has established \n2277\nprocedures. See Carranza, v. I.N.S., 277 F.3d 65, 72-3 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485, \n2288 492 (8th Cir. 2001) (reversing a finding that a criminal defendant can force the Department of Justice to \ncomply with its death penalty protocol); Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607-8.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n13 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1264   Page 25 of 37\n \n11 discretionary and reversible, and ‘confers no substantive right, immigration status or \n22 pathway to citizenship.’”) \n33 The Supreme Court has held that, for due process purposes, a benefit “is not a \n44 protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it in their \n55 discretion.” Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756. For Due Process purposes, statutes or \n66 regulations limit discretion only when they contain “‘explicitly mandatory language’”—\n77 i.e., “specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations’ substantive \n88 predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow.” Ky. Dep’t of Corrs. v. \n99 Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462–63 (1989) (citation omitted). Nor does the provision of \n1111 certain procedures by an agency itself give rise to a federal constitutional dimension. See, \n1122 e.g., Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51 (1983) (“[a] liberty interest . . . cannot be \n1133 the right to demand needless formality. Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional \n1144 purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim \n1155 of entitlement.”).  \nNeither the constitution nor Congress provides an individual in unlawful status a \n1166\nprotected interest in family reunification, living or working in the United States, or in \n1177\ndiscretionary relief from removal. See De Mercado v. Mukasey, 566 F.3d 810, 816 (9th \n1188\nCir. 2009). Garcia v. Holder, No., 07-60271, 320 F. App’x 288, 290 (9th Cir. April 9, \n1199\n2009); Pilapil v. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970), cert denied, 400 U.S. 908 (1970).7 \n2200\nNor can Plaintiff claim an entitlement in this case that creates a Constitutional interest. \n2211\n“To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract \n2222\nneed or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, \n2233\ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal.

Lake Cnty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2011)) (“A \n77 person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or \n88 reasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief is not mutually held by the \n99 government.”).8 \n1111 The DACA policy and related guidance create no such mutually held expectation \n1122 regarding the terms for termination, id., nor do they contain no “explicitly mandatory \n1133 language,” Thompson, 490 U.S. at 462–63. The policy is codified in no statute or \n1144 regulation.9 Its source—the DACA Memo—describes it as a “policy” for the “exercise of \n1155 prosecutorial discretion.” Dkt. No. 39-4 at 3; see Omar v. McHugh, 646 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. \nCir. 2011) (the “use of the word ‘policy’”—“rather than a word such as ‘right’—\n1166\nreinforces the conclusion that Congress did not intend to create an ‘entitlement’”). And \n1177\nthe agency’s public guidance makes clear that, under DACA, deferred action “may be \n1188\nterminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \n1199\n2200\n                                                 \n2211\n8 Plaintiff’s reliance on cases that discuss violations of non-discretionary procedures in agency \n2222 regulations are inapposite where deferred action and related employment authorization are discretionary \nconcepts not tied to statute or regulation. See Dkt. No. 39-1 at 24-25 (citing United States v. Raya-Vaca, \n2233\n771 F.3d 1195, 1203 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2014) (liberty interest arising from risk of removal on an expedited \nremoval order, not the loss of something conferred by a discretionary policy)); Trinidad y Garcia v. \n2244\nThomas, 683 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2012) (“An extraditee thus possesses a narrow liberty interest: that \n2255 the Secretary comply with her statutory and regulatory obligations [to consider an extraditees’ torture \nclaim].”); Singh v.

Jan. 19, 2010) \n2266\n(addressing questions of regulatory procedures for asylum termination outside of removal proceedings). \n \n2277\n9 The only regulation that references deferred action, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14), long predates the DACA \n2288 policy, and only allows aliens with deferred action to apply for employment authorization if they can \ndemonstrate an economic need for employment. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n15 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1266   Page 27 of 37\n \n11 discretion.” Dkt. No. 39-4 at 5; see also Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 17 (noting that the grant of \n22 deferred action is discretionary).  \n33 Because DACA is discretionary and “may be terminated at any time, with or \n44 without” notice, Plaintiff necessarily cannot have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the \n55 favorable exercise of discretion regarding DACA. Even assuming arguendo that deferred \n66 action is viewed as a benefit, Plaintiff lacks any protected constitutional interest in \n77 deferred action. See Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756; Velasco-Gutierrez, 732 F.2d at 798.  \n88 2.  Plaintiff is Not Likely to Succeed on His Claims under the \nAPA or Constitution. \n99\na.  USCIS’s DACA Termination Fully Complied with its \n1111 SOP and Other Policies. \n1122\nPlaintiff can state no claim under the APA because USCIS’s Decision fully \n1133\ncomplied with its SOP and other policies, and the APA in general. First, USCIS’s \n1144\nDecision specifically quotes the SOP provision on which it is based. Dkt. No. 39-6 at \n1155\n195. Second, USCIS’s Decision demonstrates adherence to all the procedural steps in the \n1166\ncited SOP guidelines: consultation with ICE; consideration of whether continuing DACA \n1177\nis inconsistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities; and USCIS’s consideration of \n1188\nPlaintiff’s response and the agency’s voluntary consideration of his supplemental \n1199\nresponse to that NOIT.  Id. Following that review, USCIS found “that continuing to \n2200\nexercise prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against you is not consistent \n2211\nwith DHS’s enforcement priorities. Therefore USCIS does not find that you merit a \n2222\nfavorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion and will not continue to defer DHS removal \n2233\naction against you under DACA.” Id. at 3. \n2244\nPlaintiff, without citation, attempts to reconstruct the DACA SOP to argue that: \n2255\n“[i]f a DACA recipient meets the DACA Memo’s objectively verifiable criteria, he or she \n2266\nremains, by definition, a ‘low priority case.’ In other words, that individual is not an \n2277\nenforcement priority.” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 19. Plaintiff goes on to paraphrase the various \n2288\ngrounds for DACA termination discussed in the SOP, but omits the ground applied to \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n16 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1267   Page 28 of 37\n \n11 him: “Enforcement Priority.” Id. at 19; see also Dkt. No. 39-4 at 79-81. Notably, this \n22 DACA termination provision was in the August 2013 version of the SOP, well before the \n33 Kelly Memo issued in January 2017. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot support his claim that \n44 “Defendants purport to label Mr. Gonzalez an enforcement priority on grounds applicable \n55 only to non-DACA recipients. . . . This is a failure to follow unambiguous internal rules.” \n66 Dkt. No. 39-1 at 20. While Defendants maintain that the operative DACA SOP allows for \n77 a fluid definition of enforcement priorities and that nothing precludes Defendants from \n88 determining an individual is an enforcement priority on a case-by-case basis, the Court \n99 need not even consider those arguments to find that Plaintiff cannot succeed here because \n1111 Plaintiff’s alleged role in an alien smuggling enterprise is clearly identified as an \n1122 enforcement priority in USCIS’s 2011 NTA guidance. See Dkt. No. 39-4 at 62.  \n1133 Plaintiff next argues that “ICE’s issuance of an NTA against him for nothing more \n1144 than unlawful presence” is not “‘a reasoned basis for terminating DACA.’” Dkt. No. 39-1 \n1155 at 20 (citing Inland Empire—Immigrant Youth Collective v. Duke, No. EDCV 17–2048, \n2017 WL 5900061, at *6-7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (“IEIYC”)). While Defendants \n1166\ndisagree with the court’s grant of a preliminary injunction in IEIYC, it followed the \n1177\nautomatic termination of DACA based on NTA issuance alone, which is no longer the \n1188\ncase here. Moreover, Defendants’ Termination makes clear that it is based on more than \n1199\n“ICE’s issuance of an NTA against him for nothing more than unlawful presence.” Dkt. \n2200\nNo. 39-1 at 20. Rather, USCIS stated: \n2211\n2222 USCIS does not rely solely on the ground listed in the charging document as \nit may not reflect all derogatory information and/or the assessment of whether \n2233\nor not you are considered an enforcement priority.  \n2244\nDkt. No. 39-6 at 196. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not and cannot demonstrate that \n2255\nDefendants have ignored their own DACA termination policy.10 \n2266\n                                                 \n10 Plaintiff also appears to argue that the DACA SOP requires a criminal conviction to support DACA \n2277\ntermination, whereas the Kelly Memo prioritizes charged or suspected criminal conduct. Dkt. No. 39-1 \n2288 at 20, citing Dkt. No. 39-6 at 208. However, even the provision that Plaintiff cites only supports a \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n17 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1268   Page 29 of 37\n \nb. USCIS’s DACA Termination was Neither Arbitrary Nor \n11\nCapricious.  \n22\nPlaintiff also challenges USCIS’s Decision as arbitrary and capricious because \n33\nUSCIS’s discretion is not based on “reasoned decision-making,” and that USCIS has \n44\nimproperly departed “from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard[ed] rules that \n55\nare still on the books.” Dkt. No. 39-1 (citations omitted). Additionally, Plaintiff accuses \n66\nUSCIS’s termination of amounting “to nothing less than assertion of the same unfettered \n77\ndiscretion this Court already “categorically reject[ed].” Id., citing Dkt. No. 12 at 10.  \n88\n  As an initial matter, Plaintiff misrepresents this Court’s prior order. The position \n99\nthat the Court “categorically rejected” was what the Court characterized as Defendants’ \n1111\nargument that “DHS possesses such broad prosecutorial discretion they need not follow \n1122\nthe DACA SOP in terminating the status of DACA recipients.” Id. The Court’s prior \n1133\nconclusion then has no application to Defendants exercise of the discretion provided by \n1144\nthe SOP – to terminate DACA where a recipient is deemed to be an enforcement priority.  \n1155\n  Indeed, Plaintiff’s arguments make it clear that he is not challenging the process by \n1166\nwhich USCIS terminated his DACA, but he is instead challenging how USCIS exercised \n1177\nits discretion – an action for which this Court lacks jurisdiction. Plaintiff’s arbitrary and \n1188\ncapricious analysis suffers from the same flaw as his argument about Defendants’ \n1199\ncompliance with the SOP – he concludes that USCIS failed “to comply with the DACA \n2200\nMemo and the termination provision of the DACA SOP,” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 22, but offers \n2211\n2222                                                  \nrequirement that USCIS adjudicators investigate beyond a RAP sheet to ascertain whether a DACA \n2233\nrequestor has actually been convicted of a crime. Id. Notably the same SOP provision that Plaintiff cites \nindicates that certain criminal conduct may render an individual “not eligible for consideration of \n2244\nDACA,” but states that “the requestor’s entire offense history can be considered along with other facts \n2255 to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, he/she warrants an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion.” Id. at 204. Ultimately, the DACA SOP is silent as to the factors USCIS is to \n2266\nuse in DACA termination decisions based where an individual is determined to be an enforcement \npriority, and the DACA SOP and related guidance support that DACA may be terminated on a \n2277\ndiscretionary case-by-case basis even where a DACA recipient otherwise meets the guidelines. Dkt. No. \n2288 39-4 at 81; id. at 11 (“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be \nterminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1269   Page 30 of 37\n \n11 no cogent explanation why USCIS’s Termination fails in this regard. Indeed, Plaintiff \n22 again states, without citation, that “[b]ecause Defendants have acknowledged that Mr. \n33 Gonzalez has never been convicted of a crime and does not pose a threat to public safety, \n44 their decision to rescind his DACA because he is somehow an ‘enforcement priority’ has \n55 not basis is reasoned decision-making.” Id. However, where Plaintiff has not and cannot \n66 demonstrate that Defendants’ discretion to determine that he is an enforcement priority is \n77 constrained by his lack of conviction of public safety concern, his argument fails. \n88   Plaintiff also attempts to add requirements to Defendants’ discretionary exercise by \n99 analogy to other cases. However, none of these cases change the nature of USCIS’s \n1111 discretion regarding DACA termination on enforcement priority grounds. See Dkt. No. \n1122 39-1 at 22-23. In Movsisian v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit \n1133 held that the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) abused its discretion when it denied \n1144 a motion to reopen without articulating any reasons. 395 F.3d at 1098. In Natural \n1155 Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A., 966 F.2d 1292 (9th Cir. 1992), the Ninth \nCircuit was not reviewing an exercise of discretion, but instead found arbitrary and \n1166\ncapricious an agency rulemaking that relied on an “unsubstantiated assumption.” Id. at \n1177\n1305. Nor was the Ninth Circuit reviewing a discretionary action in United States v. One \n1188\n1985 Mercedes, 917 F.2d 415 (9th Cir. 1990), where it cited the unremarkable \n1199\nproposition that “agency policy must be implemented and rules enforced consistently and \n2200\npredictably.” Id. at 423. Rather, key to the Ninth Circuit’s holding in One 1985 Mercedes \n2211\nwas that the claimant there “must establish that the policy in question had the force and \n2222\neffect of law, i.e., that the policy ‘(1) prescribe[d] substantive rules—not interpretive \n2233\nrules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization, procedure or \n2244\npractice—and, (2) conform[ed] to certain procedural requirements.’” Id. (citing Rank v. \n2255\nNimmo, 677 F.2d 692, 698 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 907 (1982)) (emphasis \n2266\nin original). That Bertelsen v. Hartford Life Insurance Co., 1 F. Supp. 3d 1060 (E.D. Cal. \n2277\n2014), found that an administrative decision denying disability benefits was arbitrary and \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n19 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1270   Page 31 of 37\n \n11 capricious because it was based on incomplete information following previous careful \n22 examinations is of no help to Plaintiff here because the standards demanding such \n33 explanation in the decision were based on statute and regulation and case law interpreting \n44 those requirements. Id. at 1071. And finally, Plaintiff’s reliance on In re Guerreo-\n55 Morales, 512 F. Supp. 1328 (D. Minn. 1981), is misplaced where subsequent controlling \n66 authority analyzes guidance more like the DACA policy to find no jurisdiction over \n77 deferred action decisions. See, e.g., Raffington v. Cangemi, No. CIV. 04-3846, 2004 WL \n88 2420642, at *5 (D. Minn. Oct. 6, 2004) (recognizing that revised Operating Instructions \n99 superseded In re Guerreo-Morales), aff’d. 399 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2005). In contrast to \n1111 this authority, here, USCIS articulated its reasons for termination in a manner consistent \n1122 with the DACA SOP. Here, while Plaintiff may disagree with USCIS’s assessment of the \n1133 facts, USCIS’s Decision is not based on an unsubstantiated assumption. Here, not only is \n1144 the policy that Plaintiff challenges not a substantive rule that has conformed to no \n1155 procedural requirement, but Plaintiff fails to even allege that Defendant has applied its \nenforcement priority DACA termination provision inconsistently or unpredictably. Thus, \n1166\nPlaintiff’s claim is not bolstered by citation to inapposite authority.  \n1177\nAdditionally, Plaintiff’s reliance on Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 53 (2011), to \n1188\nargue that Defendants’ NOIT indicates a failure to engage (or potentially engage) in \n1199\n“reasoned decision-making,” also lacks merit. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 18-23. In Judulang, the \n2200\nSupreme Court held that “[b]y hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary \n2211\nrelief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories - a matter irrelevant to \n2222\nthe alien's fitness to reside in this country - the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in \n2233\na reasoned manner.” Judulang, 565 U.S. at 54. Plaintiff’s claims are unlike the Judulang \n2244\nCourt’s concerns about the relationship of the exercise of discretion to the purpose of the \n2255\nimmigration laws. Here, Plaintiff cannot show that the approach of the DACA \n2266\ntermination SOP regarding individuals identified as enforcement priorities is untied from \n2277\nthe non-statutory and non-regulatory DACA policy and guidance that allow for case-by-\n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n20 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1271   Page 32 of 37\n \n11 case discretionary determinations whether individuals have become enforcement \n22 priorities after their receipt of DACA. Indeed, the only way for Plaintiff to attempt to \n33 make this argument is for him to inaccurately re-characterize the Termination. Neither \n44 the plain text of the Termination nor the circumstances that gave rise to the NTA issuance \n55 support Plaintiff’s re-characterization. See Dkt. No. 39-6 at 194-97.  \n66 Finally, Plaintiff can also not prevail on his passing citations to F.C.C. v. Fox \n77 Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502 (2009), and conclusory analysis that \n88 “[u]nexplained departure from established practice is arbitrary and capricious and must \n99 be set aside,” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 18, 21. Rather, Defendants’ conclusion that Plaintiff is \n1111 now an enforcement priority is not a change in policy that calls for the application of Fox, \n1122 556 U.S. at 514–16. In Fox, the Supreme Court held that the APA “makes no distinction . \n1133 . . between initial agency action and subsequent agency action undoing or revising that \n1144 action.” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515 (reversing on this basis). Instead, what the Supreme Court \n1155 required in Fox is that when reviewing changes in agency policy, an agency must \n“display awareness that it is changing position” and must show that there are “good \n1166\nreasons for the new policy.” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. Fox only applies to changes in agency \n1177\npolicy. See 556 U.S. at 514 (holding that when an agency changes policy, it must show \n1188\nno more than that it “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory \n1199\nexplanation for its action.”).  \n2200\nHere, USCIS’s policies regarding DACA termination and enforcement priorities \n2211\nhave not changed – USCIS has merely changed its view regarding how its existing \n2222\ndiscretion should be exercised in Plaintiff’s case. Moreover, even if Fox applied here, the \n2233\nTermination displays an awareness to terminate an existing grant of DACA (“USCIS \n2244\nfinds that continuing to exercise prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against \n2255\nyou is not consistent with the DHS’s enforcement priorities”), and provides good reasons \n2266\nfor the intended termination (“USCIS does not find that you merit a favorable exercise of \n2277\n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n21 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1272   Page 33 of 37\n \n11 prosecutorial discretion and will not continue to defer DHS removal action against you \n22 under DACA.”). Dkt. No. 39-6 at 196. \n33 c.  Plaintiff Received All the Process He is Due.  \n44 Where the alleged deprivation at the center of Plaintiff’s claim is removal from the \n55 United States that have impacted the termination of his DACA, Plaintiff must challenge \n66 the initiation of removal proceedings through the course of those removal proceedings. \n77 e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1038. And, Plaintiff’s claim for “freedom from arbitrary \n88 adjudicative procedures,” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 26 (citing Castillo v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 959 \n99 F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1262 (C.D. Cal. 2013)), cannot be sustained where the adjudicative \n1111 procedures he challenges allow for such discretion. \n1122 Even if the Court finds that Plaintiff can plead a viable constitutional claim, here, \n1133 he fails on the merits of that that claim because he has received all the process he is due. \n1144 “Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular \n1155 situation demands.” Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 930 (1997). There are three factors \nto balance in determining what process is constitutionally due: 1) the private interest \n1166\naffected; 2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest and the probable value of \n1177\nadditional procedural safeguards; and 3) the government interest at stake. Id. at 931–2 \n1188\n(citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976)).  \n1199\n  First, Plaintiff’s interest in the continuation of a discretionary policy that could \n2200\ndelay his removal from the United States is minimal. Such interest must be evaluated \n2211\nwithin the context of Plaintiff’s unlawful status in the United States and the overall \n2222\ndiscretionary nature of DACA policy, and the nature of his alleged criminal conduct. In \n2233\nthis way, Plaintiff’s interest in the process by which USCIS exercises its discretion \n2244\nadjudicating DACA, if more than minimal, must still be evaluated on the basis that it is \n2255\n“part and parcel of the DHS’s authority” to “initiat[e] removal proceedings on aliens \n2266\nwithout authority to remain in the United States.” Jeronimo v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 330 F. \n2277\nApp’x 821, 823–24 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 225–29 \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n22 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1273   Page 34 of 37\n \n11 (2005) (“Prisoners held in lawful confinement have their liberty curtailed by definition, \n22 so the procedural protections to which they are entitled are more limited than in cases \n33 where the right at stake is the right to be free from confinement at all.”).11  \n44 Second, the process Plaintiff received is sufficient to avoid the risk of erroneous \n55 deprivation. Indeed, “[w]hen a government-created property interest is at stake, due \n66 process principles require at least notice and an opportunity to respond in some manner, \n77 whether in writing or at an oral hearing, before termination of that interest.” Cleveland \n88 Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). That notice and opportunity to \n99 respond “are among the most important procedural mechanisms for avoiding erroneous \n1111 deprivations.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 226 (citations omitted). Here, Plaintiff argues that \n1122 USCIS offers no opportunity to rebut the facts that USCIS considers relevant, and that \n1133 additional safeguards are paramount in his circumstance because he “is effectively being \n1144 labeled a criminal.” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 27. \n1155 There can be no dispute, however, that Plaintiff has had notice and an opportunity \nto respond. Dkt. No. 39-6 at 191-2. Plaintiff was also constructively on notice that his \n1166\narrest on allegations of alien harboring gave rise to CBP’s NTA and was considered in \n1177\nUSCIS’s adjudicatory process. This information has been conveyed at various times, in \n1188\nthe course of Plaintiff’s removal proceedings. See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 10-11. These \n1199\nstatements gave Plaintiff actual notice regarding the basis for USCIS’s issuance of the \n2200\nNOIT. See Dkt. No. 39-6 at 191-192 (“USCIS has consulted with U.S. Immigration and \n2211\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) and has determined that exercising prosecutorial discretion \n2222\nto defer removal action in your case is not consistent with DH’s enforcement priorities. \n2233\nICE does not plan to issue you an NTA because CBP already issued an NTA to you on \n2244\nMay 7, 2016, and ICE has informed USCIS that it is actively pursuing your removal.”). \n2255\n2266\n                                                 \n11 Plaintiff’s reliance on MacDonald, Dkt. 39-1 at 26 (citing 400 F.3d at 690), is misplaced because the \n2277\nCourt there specifically considered the threat of deportation as the harsh sanction at issue. Here, Plaintiff \n2288 should not be allowed to disassociate his DACA challenge from his removal proceedings but allege \nharm from the risk of removal. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n23 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1274   Page 35 of 37\n \n11 Additionally, Plaintiff cannot argue that he has not received sufficiently constructive \n22 notice of why he is an enforcement priority and that his opportunity to respond has been \n33 impeded, or that his is prejudiced by the lack of such notice because Plaintiff addressed \n44 these facts in his response to USCIS’s NOIT. See Dkt. No. 39-5 at 91, 93-94.12 \n55   Nor can Plaintiff show that the lack of additional process he seeks has prejudiced \n66 him.  See Zolotukhin v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir.2005); Ali v. United \n77 States, 849 F.3d 510, 515 (1st Cir. 2017) (“There is no reason to think that, if an \n88 evidentiary hearing occurred, USCIS would not continue to rely on its own official \n99 records contemporaneous to the 1999 interview, as well as Lewis’ signature affirming \n1111 what appears to be her own handwritten statement . . . .”).13 Like in Ali, Plaintiff has not \n1122 given any reason to think that additional process would result in a different outcome. \n1133 Indeed, Plaintiff has offered no explanation for his nervous conduct described by Border \n1144 Patrol Agents when Plaintiff was in the house, and only offers his self-serving statement. \n1155 That declaration refers to Plaintiff’s sister, the acquaintance he allegedly dog-sat for, \nAdolfo, and two people in the house when he arrived, a woman, and a man named \n1166\nRomeo, who he has seen before, see Dkt. No. 39-5 at 178-181, but Plaintiff included no \n1177\nstatements from any of these potential witnesses to USCIS. Additionally, while Plaintiff \n1188\nseeks to examine all twelve individuals arrested at the house, Dkt. No. 39-1 at 12 \n1199\n(“Tellingly, Defendants neither name the three witnesses who allegedly identified Mr. \n2200\nGonzalez nor disclose the results of the photo lineups shown to the other nine individuals, \n2211\nwho presumably did not identify him.”), Plaintiff ignores USCIS’s statement that “the I-\n2222\n2233\n                                                 \n12 Plaintiff’s analogy to Gete v. INS, 121 F.3d 1285, 1297 (9th Cir. 1997), to argue that Defendants’ \n2244\ntermination here is based on a similarly “bare” notice lacks merit. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 28. Here, Plaintiff \n2255 was on direct notice of the reason for his DACA termination, based on an enforcement priority finding, \nand Defendants specifically cited to the grounds and procedures in the Notice of Intent to Terminate.  \n2266\n \n13 Notably, even if Plaintiff’s challenge to the Termination was reviewable, review would be based on \n2277\nsubstantial evidence – “more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance; it is such relevant \n2288 evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Sandgathe v. Chater, \n108 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotations marks omitted). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n24 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 44   Filed 02/05/18   PageID.1275   Page 36 of 37\n \n11 213 records for all the individual detained for being present in the United States without \n22 admission do not indicate that all 12 individuals were asked to identify you in the \n33 photographic line-up”). Dkt. No. 39-6 at 196. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot succeed on \n44 the merits of his due process claim because Plaintiff cannot show additional process \n55 likely to result in a different result to Defendants’ exercise of discretion. \n66 Finally, when assessing the constitutionality of the process provided to Plaintiff, \n77 the Court should also consider the strong state interest in maintaining discretion to \n88 enforce U.S. immigration laws effectively and consistent with the statutory removal \n99 scheme. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 490 (“There is always a public interest in prompt \n1111 execution of removal orders. . . .”); cf. Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 79–80 (1976) (“In \n1122 the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly \n1133 makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.”).  \n1144 Here, the process Plaintiff has received is more than adequate given the ultimately \n1155 discretionary policy at issue, a record that sufficiently supports Defendants’ concerns \nregarding Plaintiff’s alleged criminal conduct, and the Government’s strong interest \n1166\nregarding immigration enforcement. \n1177\n1188 B. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors Favor Defendants. \nWhere the Government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \n1199\ninterest factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). This balancing in large \n2200\npart mirrors the discussion of the Governmental interest in opposition to the merits of \n2211\nPlaintiff’s constitutional claim. Notably, it would be inappropriate for the Court to enjoin \n2222\nthe Government from terminating Plaintiff’s DACA where the Government exercised its \n2233\ndiscretion in conformity with all applicable guidance and policies, and indeed, there are no \n2244\napplicable statutes or regulations.14  \n2255\n2266\n                                                 \n2277\n14 The relief Plaintiff seeks with regard to the reinstatement of his employment authorization is all the \n2288 more troubling because the termination of employment authorization is tied to commencement of \nremoval proceedings, not to the termination of Plaintiff’s DACA.

See Dec. 21, 2017 Termination Notice, Exhibit A. That notice \n33 acknowledges that, pursuant to this Court’s September 29, 2017 Order, it cannot take \n44 effect until further order of this Court. Id. at 3. Accordingly, Defendants respectfully \n55 request that the Court issue an Order dissolving the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order, \n66 and alternatively issue a more limited order allowing Defendants’ December 21, 2017, \n77 Termination Notice to take effect.1   \n88 “A party seeking modification or dissolution of an injunction bears the burden of \n99 establishing that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision or dissolution of \n1111 the injunction.” Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Southeast \n1122 Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’s, 272 F.3d 1097, 1101 (9th Cir. \n1133 2006) (moving party must demonstrate facts have changed sufficiently since court issued \n1144 its order); see also Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk C’nty Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383 (1992) (Rule \n1155 60(b)(5) movants must show significant change in facts or law) and Bellevue Manor \nAssociates v. United States, 165 F.3d 1249, 1257 (9th Cir. 1999) (Rufo standard applies \n1166\nto all Rule 60(b)(5) petitions brought on equitable grounds); see also McMillen v. Las \n1177\nVegas Twp. Constable's Office, No. 2:14-CV-00780-APG, 2015 WL 403563, at *7 (D. \n1188\nNev. Jan. 29, 2015), appeal dismissed (Sept. 15, 2015) (“That fee has now been waived, \n1199\nand McMillen's due process claim is moot. These changed circumstances warrant \n2200\ndissolution of the preliminary injunction.”); but see Sharp Healthcare v. Leavitt, No. 08-\n2211\nCV-0170 W POR, 2009 WL 790113, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2009) (“Plaintiffs are \n2222\nentitled to amend their complaint and have expressed their desire to do so, and therefore \n2233\nit is still possible that they will succeed on the merits.”)  \n2244\n2255\n2266\n                                                 \n2277 1 USCIS intends to issue a decision on Plaintiff’s DACA renewal request in the next week. \nThat decision is contingent on the newly issued Termination Notice, and as such, a ruling \n2288\non this ex parte application is needed for both decisions to take effect. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 31   Filed 12/22/17   PageID.871   Page 3 of 6\n \n11   Defendants’ Termination Notice, and actions leading to that notice, are new facts \n22 that warrant dissolution of the injunction because Defendants have complied with that \n33 order. The Court’s injunction consists of four provisions: (1) vacating Defendants’ May \n44 7, 2016 revocation of Plaintiff’s DACA and enjoining enforcement of that revocation; (2) \n55 vacating the termination of Plaintiff’s employment authorization and enjoining \n66 termination of employment authorization; (3) “that Defendants shall fully comply with \n77 the DACA SOP should Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status;” and (4) \n88 “that Defendants accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application.” Dkt. No. 12 at 13-14. \n99 Here, as a result of the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order, USCIS reinstated Plaintiff’s \n1111 DACA, accepted his DACA renewal request, issued Plaintiff a Notice of Intent to \n1122 Terminate (NOIT) his reinstated DACA, Dkt. Nos. 14-1, 14-2, & 14-3.1, and have now \n1133 issued a Termination Decision that terminates Plaintiff’s DACA. See Ex. A. That \n1144 Termination Decision fully complies with the DACA SOP.2  \n1155\n                                                 \n1166 2 Even if Plaintiff seeks to challenge the substance of Defendants’ new Termination \nNotice, the dissolution of the present injunction is warranted where Defendants’ actions \n1177\nsubsequent to the injunction render the entirety of Plaintiff’s complaint moot. Claims for \n1188 injunctive relief become moot once subsequent events have made clear the conduct \nalleged as the basis for the requested relief “could not reasonably be expected to recur,” \n1199\nBayer v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 861 F.3d 853, 864 (9th Cir. 2017), and also where \n2200 “interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the \nalleged violation.” Lindquist v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 776 F.2d 851, 854 (9th Cir. \n2211\n1985) (quoting Los Angeles C’nty v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)). While Defendants \n2222\nacknowledge that courts must construe a complaint in the light most favorable to the \n2233 plaintiff, see Dkt. No. 29 at 3, n.1, citing Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1500 (9th Cir. \n1995), cert. dismissed, 116 S. Ct. 1710 (1996), such construction is limited to motions to \n2244\ndismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Here, Defendants contend that Plaintiff has \n2255 received all the relief requested in his complaint and that the final agency action \nchallenged there – the May 7, 2016 DACA revocation – no longer exists. Defendants \n2266\nintend to move to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint on these 12(b)(1) grounds on or before \n2277\nDecember 29, 2017, if Plaintiff does not amend his complaint before then. See, e.g., \n2288 Elder v. Nat'l Conference of Bar Examiners, No. C 11-00199 SI, 2011 WL 4079623, at \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 31   Filed 12/22/17   PageID.872   Page 4 of 6\n \n11 First, USCIS’s Notice of Decision specifically quotes the SOP provision on which \n22 it is based:  \n33 If after consulting with ICE, USCIS determines that exercising prosecutorial \ndiscretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with \n44\nthe Department of Homeland Security's enforcement priorities, and ICE does \n55 not plan to issue an NTA, the officer should refer the case to HQSCOPS \n[Headquarters  Service  Center  Operations],  through  the  normal  chain  of \n66\ncommand, to determine whether or not a NOIT [Notice of Intent to Terminate] \n77\nis appropriate. If it is determined that the case warrants final termination, the \n88 officer will issue DACA 603 - Termination Notice [Enforcement Priority, Not \nAutomatically Terminated] from the Appendix I. \n99\nSee Ex. A at 2 (emphasis added), quoting Dkt. No. 2-9 at 15. Second, USCIS’s \n1111\nTermination Notice demonstrates adherence to all the procedural steps in the SOP \n1122\nguidelines above:  consultation with ICE; consideration of whether continuing DACA is \n1133\ninconsistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities; and USCIS’s consideration of Plaintiff’s \n1144\nresponse and the agency’s voluntary consideration of his supplemental response to that \n1155\nNOIT.  Id. In short, the USCIS termination decision states that after consultation with \n1166\nICE and considering Plaintiff’s response to the NOIT and the totality of the \n1177\ncircumstances, USCIS “finds that continuing to exercise prosecutorial discretion to defer \n1188\nremoval action against you is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities. \n1199\nTherefore USCIS does not find that you merit a favorable exercise of prosecutorial \n2200\ndiscretion and will not continue to defer DHS removal action against you under DACA.” \n2211\nEx.

Sept. 12, 2011) (“The Court finds that the issues between the parties are \nmoot. Plaintiff has received all of the relief he sought in his complaint. Therefore, the \n2288\nbond should be dissolved and the case DISMISSED.”). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 31   Filed 12/22/17   PageID.873   Page 5 of 6\n \nUSCIS has consulted with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \n11\nand has determined that exercising prosecutorial discretion to defer removal \n22 action in your case is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities.  ICE \ninformed USCIS that it considers you an enforcement priority, and that ICE \n33\ndid not plan to issue an NTA because CBP already issued an NTA to you on \n44\nMay 7, 2016, and that ICE was actively prosecuting your removal based on \n55 the CBP-issued NTA, and ICE’s determination that you are an enforcement \npriority, in immigration court in accordance with INA § 240. \n66\n \n77 Subsequent to issuing you the NOIT, the immigration proceedings that were \ninitiated against you by CBP on May 7, 2016 were terminated on November \n88\n17,  2017;  however,  ICE  once  again  confirmed  it  still  views  you  as  an \n99\nenforcement  priority  and  issued  you  a  new  NTA  on  December  8,  2017 \n1111 demonstrating that ICE is actively pursuing your removal. DHS records show \nthat you have a master calendar hearing date with an Immigration Judge \n1122\nscheduled for March 20, 2018. \n1133  \nUSCIS received your response to the NOIT on December 18, 2017. Pursuant \n1144\nto your request, although USCIS was not required to do so, we allowed you \n1155\nto submit a supplemental response on December 19, 2017 to address the ICE-\nissued NTA on December 8, 2017 that you claimed you had not received. \n1166\n \n1177\nIn your response to the NOIT, you provided information concerning your \n1188 perspective on your encounter with border patrol agents on May 7, 2017.

Dkt. 12 at 12. The\n6 Court further concluded that “Plaintiff [would] suffer significant irreparable harm\n7 in the absence of an injunction by losing his DACA status and the ability to apply\n8 for renewal of that status.” Id. The opinion goes on to explain that Mr. Gonzalez\n9 would lose his right to employment, the ability to provide financially for himself\n10 and his family, and his sense of well-being, and would be subject “to a constant\n11 threat of apprehension and possible removal from the only country he has called\n12 home.” Id. For all these reasons, the Court fashioned a remedial order that was\n13 intended to redress Defendants’ violations of the APA and to protect Mr. Gonzalez\n14 from the harms inflicted as a result of their arbitrary and capricious actions. It\n15 vacated the termination of his DACA status, ordered Defendants to comply with\n16 the DACA SOP if they elected to reconsider his DACA status, and required\n17 Defendants to accept (and presumably consider) his DACA renewal application.\n18 In the weeks following the entry of the Preliminary Injunction, it became\n19 apparent that the Court’s Order would need to be modified to achieve its goals.\n20 Because Defendants had unlawfully terminated his DACA status, Mr. Gonzalez\n21 was unable to submit a renewal application until this Court vacated the termination\n22 and reinstated his status. As a result, he applied for renewal so close to the end\n23 date of his current DACA term that he was likely to see his reinstated status expire\n24 weeks or months before USCIS issued a decision on his renewal application.\n25 During that time, Mr. Gonzalez would be left without DACA protection and\n26 subject to the very harms identified by the Court, all as a direct result of\n27 Defendants’ unlawful termination of his DACA status. Accordingly, Mr. Gonzalez\n28 brought this motion to modify the Preliminary Injunction, in order to assure that it\n1\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.732   Page 3 of 10\n1 would protect him adequately from the irreparable harms it was intended to\n2 prevent.\n3 Defendants’ opposition to the Motion to Modify only reinforces the need for\n4 the requested modification. Defendants explain that on November 13, 2017,\n5 roughly six weeks after the Court entered its Preliminary Injunction, they issued\n6 Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) his current DACA status.\n7 They further note that Defendant “USCIS anticipates completing the adjudication\n8 of its intended termination of Plaintiff’s reinstated DACA and adjudication of his\n9 pending DACA renewal request on or before December 22, 2017.” Dkt. 18 at 2\n10 (emphasis added). In other words, during the week before Christmas, Defendants\n11 intend to (1) terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and (2) either deny his DACA\n12 renewal application for the same improper reasons, or (as seems more likely\n13 because USCIS has not yet issued Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Intent to Deny the\n14 renewal application) declare the application moot because his preexisting DACA\n15 status will have been terminated, leaving nothing to renew. It bears emphasis that\n16 Defendants have undertaken this entire process so that they can terminate Mr.\n17 Gonzalez’s DACA status less than a week before it is already set to expire on\n18 December 22.\n19 Defendants’ efforts to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and\n20 summarily reject his renewal application are arbitrary and capricious, violate the\n21 DACA SOP, and are plainly intended to deny him the protections of the\n22 Preliminary Injunction. The sole ground for termination in the NOIT is CBP’s\n23 issuance of an NTA against him based on unlawful presence in the United States\n24 and ICE’s decision to pursue the removal proceedings. But unlawful presence is\n25 an irrelevant factor in determining eligibility for DACA status. All DACA\n26 applicants are, by definition, unlawfully present. Accordingly, the NOIT is\n27 arbitrary and capricious and provides no reasoned basis to which Mr. Gonzalez can\n28 respond, and termination on the asserted grounds represents a failure to engage in\n2\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.733   Page 4 of 10\n1 the mandatory exercise of discretion that the SOP requires before USCIS can make\n2 a determination with respect to DACA status.\n3 Mr. Gonzalez is not asking the Court to resolve the merits of these serious\n4 APA and constitutional issues on this motion. He notes only that Defendants’\n5 issuance of the NOIT and their subsequent statements in opposition to this motion\n6 represent changed circumstances that threaten to deprive him of the intended\n7 protections of the Preliminary Injunction. Mr. Gonzalez therefore asks that the\n8 Court modify its injunction, as other courts in similar circumstances have done, to\n9 enjoin the termination or expiration of his DACA status and denial of his renewal\n10 application pending judicial determination (through and including final appellate\n11 review) of whether Defendants are complying with the Preliminary Injunction and\n12 the law.\n13 I. LEGAL STANDARD\n14 “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment,\n15 often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the\n16 legal issues it presents.” Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct.\n17 2080, 2087 (2017). “The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the\n18 [judge] to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility\n19 rather than rigidity has distinguished it.” Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S.\n20 305, 312 (1982) (quoting Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944)); see\n21 Northwest Environmental Defense Ctr. v. Gordon, 849 F.2d 1241, 1244-45 (9th\n22 Cir. 1988) (“courts of equity have broad discretion in shaping remedies”).\n23 Accordingly, a court “may modify the scope of its injunction under its continuing\n24 duty to supervise the relief granted if it is informed of new facts that require\n25 additional supervisory action.” State v. Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2017 WL\n26 2989048, at *4 (D. Haw. July 13, 2017) (quoting Nat’l Grange of the Order of\n27 Patrons of Husbandry v. Cal. State Grange, 182 F. Supp. 3d 1065, 1074 (E.D. Cal.\n28 2016)). As circumstances develop subsequent to the entry of a preliminary\n3\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.734   Page 5 of 10\n1 injunction, the Court “has a continuing duty to maintain a status quo.” Hoffman\n2 for & on Behalf of NLRB v. Beer Drivers & Salesmen’s Local Union No. 888, 536\n3 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1976). These directives flow from the Court’s power to\n4 modify its orders when necessary to “achieve the purposes” of an injunction. U.S.\n5 v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 249 (1968).\n6 II. ARGUMENT\n7 In their opposition to this motion, Defendants contend that any challenge to\n8 their effort to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status pursuant to the November\n9 13, 2017 NOIT or their subsequent denial (or dismissal) of his DACA renewal\n10 application is beyond the scope of the complaint in this case and therefore not\n11 subject to the Preliminary Injunction. But Mr. Gonzalez’s Complaint is plainly\n12 directed at preventing any termination effort that does not comply with the DACA\n13 SOP and assuring a fair consideration of his renewal application. Defendants’\n14 strained effort to recharacterize his claims must therefore be rejected out of hand,\n15 and the Preliminary Injunction should be modified to assure that Mr. Gonzalez is\n16 protected from the harms the Court has found are likely to result from any\n17 unlawful efforts to deprive him of DACA status.\n18 In similar circumstances, the Ninth Circuit recently affirmed a district\n19 court’s modification of the district court’s preliminary injunction in response to\n20 “the Government’s restricted reading of” the terms of that injunction (as modified\n21 by the Supreme Court). State v. Trump, 871 F.3d 646, 658 (9th Cir. 2017). In that\n22 case, the Supreme Court held that the Government could not apply its immigration\n23 restrictions to people with a “close familial relationship” to a U.S. citizen and that\n24 a mother-in-law “clearly has such a relationship.” Id. at 655. In implementing this\n25 directive, the Government excluded a variety of familial relationships without a\n26 “persuasive explanation” of why they were not at least as close as that of mother-\n27 in-law. Id. Because the “Government unreasonably interpret[ed]” the Supreme\n28 Court’s modification, id. at 655, the Ninth Circuit held that the district court “did\n4\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.735   Page 6 of 10\n1 not err” in changing the precise terms of its injunction to cover several additional\n2 relationships, id. at 658.\n3 Here, Defendants are “unreasonably interpreting” this Court’s Preliminary\n4 Injunction by (1) mischaracterizing Mr. Gonzalez’s complaint, (2) ignoring the\n5 DACA SOP, and (3) doing what this Court already made clear is unlawful and\n6 “indefensible”—terminating Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and denying his\n7 renewal application without exercising reasoned discretion, on the sole ground that\n8 he received a Notice to Appear in Immigration Court for unlawful presence in the\n9 United States, see Dkt. 12 at 9-11.\n10 In his Complaint, Mr. Gonzalez seeks “restor[ation of his] DACA status and\n11 attendant benefits, including employment authorization, pending a reconsideration\n12 of its termination decision, in which Defendants provide him notice of their intent\n13 to terminate, a reasoned basis for that intent, and an opportunity to respond with\n14 argument and evidence.” Dkt. 1 at 27 (emphasis added).1 While citing this very\n15 request, Defendants’ opposition asserts that Mr. Gonzalez’s claims are now moot\n16 because USCIS issued him an NOIT (the purported “notice, basis, and opportunity\n17 to respond that he seeks”), and because the “basis for the requested relief could not\n18 be reasonably expected to recur.” Dkt. 18 at 3-5.\n19 But the problem underlying Mr. Gonzalez’s claims is already recurring.\n20 Defendants are again attempting to terminate his DACA status and to prevent him\n21 from seeking renewal without providing him any reasoned basis for their decision.\n22 Defendants are thus violating the DACA SOP, including its requirement that they\n23 exercise reasoned discretion in making DACA status determinations. And Mr.\n24 Gonzalez is subject to the same irreparable harm identified by the Court, resulting\n25 from the same essential conduct that the Court enjoined as arbitrary and capricious.\n26\n27 1 Mr. Gonzalez’s preliminary injunction motion similarly requested “a proper\nprocedure that accords with DHS and USCIS policies and due process” and sought\n28\n“the reasons for” any purported termination. Dkt. 2-1 at 8, 31.\n5\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.736   Page 7 of 10\n1 The Court would therefore be well within its discretion, and fully justified, in\n2 modifying its injunction to protect Mr. Gonzalez from the harms resulting from\n3 Defendants’ APA violations and to assure that Defendants do not violate the APA\n4 a second time. There is no need for an amended complaint.\n5 While Mr. Gonzalez is not seeking adjudication of his APA challenges to\n6 Defendants’ renewed effort to deprive him of DACA status on this motion, he has\n7 serious concerns that the “process” is already irretrievably tainted. By seeking to\n8 terminate his DACA status and deny his renewal application merely because a\n9 CBP officer issued Mr. Gonzalez an NTA for unlawful presence and ICE chose to\n10 litigate that charge in Immigration Court, Defendants are flouting (1) this Court’s\n11 determination that such grounds for termination are “indefensible,” Dkt. 12 at 11,\n12 and (2) the DACA SOP’s requirement that where the “DACA requestor has been\n13 placed in proceedings on a ground that does not adversely impact the exercise of\n14 prosecutorial discretion”—i.e., unlawful presence under 8 U.S.C. §\n15 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)—USCIS must “review all derogatory information in its totality\n16 and then make an informed assessment regarding the appropriate exercise of\n17 prosecutorial discretion,” Dkt. 20-3 at 11 (emphasis added). Unlawful presence is\n18 not a relevant factor in the determination of DACA status.\n19 Moreover, to the extent that the NOIT purports to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n20 DACA status and deny his renewal application because he is suddenly an\n21 “enforcement priority,” Defendants have offered no reason for this change in\n22 position, which directly contradicts their behavior in previously granting him\n23 DACA status twice while he was unlawfully present, and for the last 18 months,\n24 during which time they have not investigated him for any unlawful activity and\n25 have allowed him to live freely in San Diego. See Dkt. 20 at 10. Indeed, the\n26 removal proceedings against Mr. Gonzalez were terminated on November 16,\n27 2017. In other words, with respect to Mr. Gonzalez’s current DACA status and his\n28 renewal application, Defendants are doing exactly what Mr. Gonzalez’s Complaint\n6\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.737   Page 8 of 10\n1 and the Court’s Preliminary Injunction seek to prohibit: reconsidering his DACA\n2 status without a reasoned basis. See Inland Empire—Immigrant Youth Collective\n3 v. Duke, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2017 WL 5900061, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017)\n4 (“the issuance of an NTA charging presence without admission does not provide a\n5 reasoned basis for terminating DACA”).\n6 Defendants’ claim that their blatantly unlawful actions constitute\n7 “substantial[] compli[ance]” with the Court’s Order is both wrong and beside the\n8 point. For the reasons outlined above, Defendants have not substantially complied\n9 with the Court’s Order or the DACA SOP, but the Court does not need to resolve\n10 that substantive question now. Instead, the Court can and should modify its\n11 Preliminary Injunction to enjoin the termination or expiration of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n12 DACA status pending the final resolution of any judicial challenges to Defendants’\n13 efforts to terminate his current DACA status and/or to deny or dismiss his renewal\n14 application. Without prejudging any of those issues, the Court would thus preserve\n15 the status quo and achieve the purposes of its injunction—i.e., a process in which\n16 “true discretion can be exercised in the manner in which that discretion is outlined\n17 in the DACA SOP.” Dkt. 20-2 at 34. It would also protect Mr. Gonzalez from the\n18 very harms the Court identified as flowing from Defendants’ adjudicated APA\n19 violations, which the Preliminary Injunction was intended to prevent.\n20 III. CONCLUSION\n21 Defendants’ opposition effectively asks the Court to dissolve its Preliminary\n22 Injunction on the basis of an illusory promise that “Defendants have already\n23 provided Plaintiff the notice, basis, and opportunity to respond that he seeks.” Dkt.\n24 18 at 5. In reality, they are asking the Court to countenance their repetition of\n25 unlawful action in the form of a sham “procedure.” See Cnty. of Santa Clara v.\n26 Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2017 WL 3086064, at *8-9 (N.D. Cal. July 20, 2017)\n27 (denying the Government’s motion for reconsideration of a preliminary injunction\n28 where the only basis offered was an “illusory promise” to exercise its power\n7\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 22   Filed 12/07/17   PageID.738   Page 9 of 10\n1 appropriately). The Court should reject this ruse and should effectuate the\n2 purposes of its Preliminary Injunction by modifying its order to enjoin any lapse of\n3 Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status pending a judicial determination (through and\n4 including final appeal) of whether Defendants are complying with the DACA SOP,\n5 the APA, and due process.\n6\n7 Dated: December 7, 2017 Respectfully submitted,\n8\n/s/ John C.

INTRODUCTION\n2 Defendants’ opposition to Mr. Gonzalez’s motion for temporary restraining\n3 order and preliminary injunction rests entirely on mischaracterizations of Mr.\n4 Gonzalez’s claims, the DACA program, and Defendants’ own mandatory DACA\n5 Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOP”). Defendants have only reaffirmed\n6 the merits of Mr. Gonzalez’s APA claims, and their jurisdictional arguments\n7 misconstrue the law.\n8 II. DEFENDANTS’ JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENTS RELY ON\nMISCHARACTERIZATIONS OF MR. GONZALEZ’S CLAIMS AND\n9 OF DACA, AND ON MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF LAW\n10 Defendants’ jurisdictional arguments rest entirely on their repeated\n11 misstatement that Mr. Gonzalez is challenging CBP’s “decision to issue an NTA”\n12 and therefore cannot bring his claims in federal court. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 9 at 21,\n13 25, 33 (docket pagination). Mr. Gonzalez is not challenging CBP’s issuance of an\n14 NTA. Nor is he challenging any action that is bound up in his removal\n15 proceedings. He is challenging the separate termination of his DACA status and\n16 employment authorization without an NOIT or opportunity to respond—in\n17 violation of the DACA SOP’s mandatory procedures and due process. Conceding\n18 the failure to follow those procedures, Defendants advance the unsupported\n19 assertion that CBP issuing an unlawful presence NTA is synonymous with DACA\n20 termination, so that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and (b)(9) preclude judicial review. But\n21 this alleged policy—the sole basis for Defendants’ jurisdictional arguments—has\n22 no basis in the DACA SOP. See Dkt. Nos. 1-11; 1-3 at 11-12, 18-20.\n23 Since DACA’s inception, Defendants have made clear that an NTA and\n24 DACA status are distinct. Their attempt to rewrite the DACA program for this\n25 case ignores DHS’s original 2012 DACA Memorandum; USCIS’s DACA FAQ;\n26 DHS/USCIS’s DACA approval notices; and DHS’s nondiscretionary DACA SOP\n27 termination policies. Specifically:\n28\n1\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.550   Page 7 of 16\n The DACA Memo and DACA FAQ make clear that being in removal\n1 proceedings (or having a removal order) is not mutually exclusive of DACA status.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 1-7 at 3 (eligibility for “individuals who are in removal\n2 proceedings”) (emphasis in original); 1-13 at 5-6 (“open to . . . those in removal\nproceedings, with a final order, or with a voluntary departure order”).\n3\n Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA approval notices distinguish initiation of removal\n4 proceedings from termination of DACA status. See Dkt. Nos. 1-14 at 2; 1-15 at 2\n(“Information obtained . . . will be used to determine whether termination of\n5 deferred action and/or removal proceedings are appropriate.”) (emphasis added).\n6 The DACA SOP establishes nondiscretionary termination procedures that\n7 are independent of removal proceedings. To obscure the fact that CBP’s issuance\n8 of an NTA for unlawful presence is a matter separate from USCIS’s termination of\n9 DACA status, Defendants once again attach DACA SOP Appendix I (also attached\n10 as part of Exhibit F to Mr. Gonzalez’s motion)—in which form 602 provides for\n11 “automatic” termination upon the issuance of an NTA (by USCIS or ICE, but\n12 notably not by CBP), see Dkt. Nos. 1-11 at 13-16; 9-3 at 4—but conveniently\n13 leave out the policies that dictate when form 602 is to be used. Those policies\n14 (included in Mr. Gonzalez’s Exhibit F, Dkt. No. 1-11) require USCIS to adhere to\n15 detailed procedures for Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) cases before issuing an\n16 “automatic” termination using form 602. See Dkt. Nos. 1-11 at 13-15 (“Chapter\n17 14: DACA Termination”); 1-3 at 11-12, 18-20. Even then, the NTA and the\n18 termination of DACA status are distinct events in separate proceedings before\n19 different agencies of DHS.\n20 Because Mr. Gonzalez challenges USCIS’s failure to honor his procedural\n21 rights in DACA termination proceedings that are not part of the removal\n22 proceedings against him—and does not challenge CBP’s issuance of an NTA; the\n23 merits of any discretionary determination in immigration court; or rights that flow\n24 from his removal proceedings—neither § 1252(g) nor (b)(9) bars any of his claims.\n25 The Ninth Circuit has consistently held that § 1252(g) does not preclude\n26 judicial review of (1) factual and legal determinations made prior to discretionary\n27 decisions, or (2) compliance with, or the validity of, procedures that form the\n28 backdrop of ultimate discretionary decisions. See Gete v. INS, 121 F.3d 1285,\n2\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.551   Page 8 of 16\n1 1291-92 (9th Cir. 1997); U.S. v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004)\n2 (en banc) (“district court may consider a purely legal question that does not\n3 challenge the Attorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the answer . . .\n4 forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later will exercise\n5 discretionary authority”). Moreover, courts “retain jurisdiction to review\n6 constitutional claims, even when those claims address [agency] discretionary\n7 decision[s].” Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir. 2003); see\n8 Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 452-53 & n.1 (9th Cir. 2000) (§ 1252(g) did not\n9 bar due process claim that green cards were seized without hearing).\n10 In short, Ninth Circuit precedent supports the Coyotl court’s holding that §\n11 1252(g) does not strip the courts of jurisdiction over claims like Mr. Gonzalez’s,\n12 that challenge USCIS’s failure to follow nondiscretionary procedures in DACA\n13 termination proceedings, which do not arise from the Attorney General\n14 “commenc[ing] proceedings, adjudicat[ing] cases, or execut[ing] removal orders”\n15 against an immigrant. That is doubtless why Defendants attempt to re-characterize\n16 Mr. Gonzalez’s claims as “directly challenging the decision to issue an NTA.”\n17 Dkt. No. 9 at 23 n.4. Defendants cite two Ninth Circuit cases in support of that\n18 argument,1 but those cases merely affirm the unremarkable propositions that Mr.\n19 Gonzalez may not challenge CBP’s issuance of an NTA before this Court (he is\n20 not) or ask the Court to review the result of a DACA termination decision reached\n21 in compliance with proper procedures (he is not). The Sissoko court clarified that §\n22 1252(g) barred jurisdiction in the “limited context” of that case because the\n23 plaintiff was challenging statutorily “mandatory” detention resulting from the\n24 commencement of expedited removal proceedings. 509 F.3d at 949-50. For all of\n25 the reasons discussed above and in Mr. Gonzalez’s opening brief, no statute,\n26 regulation, or policy mandates termination of his DACA status and benefits\n27\n1 I.e., Chavez-Navarro v. Ashcroft, 57 F. App’x 349 (9th Cir. 2003); Sissoko v.\n28\nRocha, 509 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 2007).\n3\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.552   Page 9 of 16\n1 because CBP issued him an NTA for unlawful presence. Section 1252(g) does not\n2 strip this Court of jurisdiction.\n3 Defendants’ § 1252(b)(9) argument fares no better. At its essence, the\n4 argument relies on an overly broad—and unsupportable—reading of the Ninth\n5 Circuit’s decision in JEFM v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026 (9th Cir. 2016), pet. for reh’g\n6 en banc filed. In fact, JEFM supports Mr. Gonzalez in this case.\n7 The JEFM decision broke with Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent\n8 making clear that by its “explicit language,” § 1252(b)(9) “appl[ies] only to those\n9 claims seeking judicial review of orders of removal.” A. Singh v. Gonzales, 499\n10 F.3d 969, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2007); see Reno v. AADC, 525 U.S. 471, 487 (1999).\n11 While the validity of its holding that the statute applies before a removal order is\n12 entered may thus be questioned, JEFM reaffirmed that § 1252(b)(9) has “built-in\n13 limits.” 837 F.3d at 1032. The statute applies to claims that “arise from” removal\n14 proceedings, but does not strip courts of jurisdiction to hear immigrants’ “claims\n15 that are collateral to, or independent of, the removal process.” Id.\n16 In JEFM, the plaintiff children challenged laws and regulations governing\n17 the immigration courts that denied government-appointed counsel to children in\n18 removal proceedings. Because the children’s right-to-counsel claims arose from\n19 their removal proceedings, id. at 1033 (“bound up in and an inextricable part of the\n20 administrative process”), the Ninth Circuit held that § 1252(b)(9) prevented them\n21 from bringing those claims in federal court in the first instance. Id. at 1035.\n22 Here, by contrast, Mr. Gonzalez’s procedural challenge to his DACA\n23 termination is entirely independent from his removal proceedings. He is\n24 challenging USCIS’s failure to follow mandatory procedures promulgated separate\n25 and apart from the laws and regulations governing immigration court and the\n26 removal process. His claims do not exist only by virtue of his removal\n27 proceedings. The APA claims he raises in this Court would exist even if\n28 Defendants had terminated his DACA status without following their procedures,\n4\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.553   Page 10 of 16\n1 but never issued an NTA. In other words—unlike in JEFM—these are procedural\n2 protections that Mr. Gonzalez has a right to vindicate even in the absence of\n3 removal proceedings.2 See Dkt. No. 1-3 at 10-11, 26-29. Accordingly, §\n4 1252(b)(9) does not prevent him from pursuing his claims in this Court. See, e.g.,\n5 Flores-Torres v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 708, 711 (9th Cir. 2008) (upholding\n6 jurisdiction over challenge to detention during removal proceedings that was\n7 deemed collateral to the removal process); see id. at 711-13 & n.6 (claim may be\n8 considered independent of removal proceedings even when its resolution might\n9 invalidate the proceedings).\n10 Defendants seek nothing less than to circumvent the “strong presumption in\n11 favor of judicial review of administrative action.” INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289,\n12 298 (2001). But their own argument that the INA precludes judicial review of\n13 “issues that can be raised in removal proceedings,” Dkt. No. 9 at 25, is fatal to that\n14 effort. By the Government’s admission, an Immigration Judge and the BIA cannot\n15 reinstate DACA status or compel Defendants to abide by the DACA SOP’s\n16 termination procedures. See Medina v. DHS, 2:17-CV-00218, Mar. 18, 2017 Hr’g\n17 Tr. at 6-8 (COURT: “[D]oes the immigration judge have the power to reinstate\n18 DACA status?” MR. ROBINS: “No, Your Honor.”); In re Javier Luis Medrano-\n19 Inocence, 2017 WL 1508874, at *2 (BIA Mar. 27, 2017) (“[W]e have no\n20 jurisdiction to grant relief under the [DACA] program.”). Defendants would thus\n21 have this Court construe the INA “to deny any judicial forum for a colorable\n22 constitutional claim,” Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988). That cannot be\n23 the law because it would raise obvious and “serious constitutional concerns.” Id.;\n24 see Aguilar v. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (“§1252(b)(9) is a judicial\n25 channeling provision, not a claim-barring one”).\n26\n2 At least one court has recognized that JEFM did not purport to overturn Ninth\n27\nCircuit precedent governing claims that are not “wholly intertwined with the\nremoval proceedings.” See Medina v. DHS, 2017 WL 2954719, at *13-16 (W.D.\n28\nWash. Mar. 14, 2017) (Report and Recommendation).\n5\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.554   Page 11 of 16\nIII. DEFENDANTS REAFFIRM THE MERITS OF MR. GONZALEZ’S\n1 APA CLAIMS\n2 Defendants’ arguments in opposition to the merits of Mr. Gonzalez’s APA\n3 claims are equally unavailing. “Pursuant to the Accardi doctrine, an administrative\n4 agency is required to adhere to its own internal operating procedures.” Church of\n5 Scientology v. U.S., 920 F.2d 1481, 1487 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing U.S. ex rel Accardi\n6 v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954)). Defendants failed to do so here and\n7 thus violated Mr. Gonzalez’s rights under the APA. Defendants attempt to distract\n8 from their indisputable misconduct by making bold and incorrect assertions of law,\n9 mischaracterizing Mr. Gonzalez’s claims, and raising post hoc justifications for\n10 their conduct and factual disputes that are not properly raised before this Court,\n11 which only underscore the need for a fair hearing at USCIS. But no amount of\n12 obfuscation hides the fact that Defendants acted unlawfully and violated their own\n13 mandatory DACA termination procedures by failing to provide Mr. Gonzalez with\n14 either an NOIT or any opportunity (let alone 33 days) to respond to the allegations\n15 against him before terminating his DACA status and employment authorization.\n16 Defendants contend that Mr. Gonzalez was not entitled “to receive any\n17 process regarding the termination . . . of DACA because deferred action is\n18 necessarily an exercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion.” Dkt. No. 9 at 27. This\n19 brash argument flies in the face of established caselaw holding that discretion with\n20 respect to DACA applications and terminations is circumscribed by mandatory\n21 procedures in DHS’s DACA SOP and the 2011 USCIS Memo it incorporates. See\n22 Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 173 (5th Cir. 2015); Coyotl v. Kelly, 2017 WL\n23 2889681, at *4 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017) (DACA SOP is nondiscretionary).\n24 Indeed, the Government conceded in Coyotl that these documents “are the\n25 guidelines that adjudicators are to apply.” Id. at *4. And they entitle Mr. Gonzalez\n26 to an NOIT and opportunity to respond. Dkt. No. 1-3 at 18-29.\n27 Defendants cannot avoid the mandates of the DACA SOP’s and 2011\n28 USCIS Memo’s detailed procedures for DACA termination by cherry-picking and\n6\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.555   Page 12 of 16\n1 mischaracterizing a broadly worded response to a DACA FAQ, see Dkt. No. 9 at\n2 32, asking “Can my deferred action under the DACA process be terminated before\n3 it expires?” The answer—“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and\n4 deferred action may be terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to\n5 Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”—does not suggest that the FAQ supersedes the\n6 DACA SOP’s detailed procedures. On the contrary, “at DHS’s discretion” must be\n7 understood in the context of those mandatory procedures, which allow for\n8 termination without an NOIT only after USCIS and ICE follow a specified\n9 procedure that Defendants concede went ignored in Mr. Gonzalez’s case.\n10 To defeat Mr. Gonzalez’s APA and Accardi claims, Defendants improperly\n11 rely on a mischaracterization of the DACA SOP and post hoc justifications for\n12 USCIS’s termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status without notice. See Shirrod\n13 v. Director, 809 F.3d 1082, 1087 n.4 (9th Cir. 2015) (court must “review only what\n14 the agency did, not what [it] could have done”); Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055,\n15 1064 (9th Cir. 2015) (agency action may only be affirmed based on “explanations\n16 offered by the agency”). They argue that “where CBP or ICE issues a Notice to\n17 Appear, the DACA guidance provides that DACA terminates automatically . . .\n18 [p]er Appendix I.” Dkt. No. 9 at 32. But neither Chapter 14 of the DACA SOP—\n19 which governs termination—nor Appendix I, on which Defendants purport to rely,\n20 says USCIS may terminate DACA status without issuing an NOIT when CBP\n21 issues an NTA based solely on unlawful presence. On the contrary, the DACA\n22 SOP requires USCIS and ICE to comply with procedures for determining that a\n23 particular case raises EPS concerns before termination without notice is permitted.\n24 See Dkt. No. 1-11 at 13-16.\n25 Defendants concede that they failed to follow those procedures. Nothing in\n26 the record indicates that anyone at USCIS ever determined Mr. Gonzalez was an\n27 EPS concern or referred his case to ICE, or that ICE ever reviewed his case or\n28 issued an NTA based on a determination that it was an EPS case. On the contrary,\n7\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.556   Page 13 of 16\n1 CBP (not ICE) issued Mr. Gonzalez’s NTA based solely on unlawful presence\n2 without reference to any criminal violation. Under those circumstances, the\n3 DACA SOP required that USCIS provide Mr. Gonzalez notice and an opportunity\n4 to respond before his DACA status was terminated. See Dkt. No. 1-11 at 13-16.\n5 Defendants attempt to justify USCIS’s termination without notice by\n6 pointing to notes of interviews with three of the undocumented immigrants\n7 allegedly found at the house where Mr. Gonzalez was arrested, who supposedly\n8 identified him in a photographic array as having had a role in their concealment.\n9 Dkt. No. 9 at 16. Of course, the same interview notes suggest that the other nine\n10 individuals—whom CBP also interviewed—did not identify Mr. Gonzalez. For\n11 their part, Defendants interviewed Mr. Gonzalez for two days before losing interest\n12 in him—allowing him to be released for just $5,000 after a hearing in which an\n13 Immigration Judge determined that he was not a public safety concern—and never\n14 charged him with a crime or investigated him again for the past 16 months.\n15 Ultimately, the factual dispute over Mr. Gonzalez’s involvement with the\n16 immigrants found at the house is not part of the procedural claims before this\n17 Court; it must be considered by USCIS in a proper termination proceeding in\n18 which Mr. Gonzalez—who vigorously contests Defendants’ allegations—has an\n19 opportunity to tell his side of the story.\n20 In sum: (1) USCIS did not base its termination of DACA on any finding that\n21 Mr. Gonzalez was an EPS concern and cannot now rely on that reasoning to justify\n22 its unlawful decision not to issue an NOIT, see San Luis & Delta-Mendoza Water\n23 Auth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, 603 (9th Cir. 2014); and (2) the parties’ factual\n24 dispute only underscores the wisdom of the DACA SOP’s procedural safeguards.\n25 Defendants’ assertion that courts “decline[] to apply the Accardi doctrine in\n26 matters of prosecutorial discretion” is simply wrong. Accardi itself was a case\n27 about the exercise of discretion in immigration removal proceedings. And courts\n28 have applied the Accardi doctrine in a wide variety of enforcement contexts. See,\n8\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.557   Page 14 of 16\n1 e.g., INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996); McDonald v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 684,\n2 686 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2005); Sameena Inc. v. U.S. Air Force, 147 F.3d 1148, 1153\n3 (9th Cir. 1998). Nor is the Accardi doctrine “inapplicable in the context of internal\n4 operating guidelines that preserve the exercise of agency discretion.” Dkt. No. 9 at\n5 34. In the Ninth Circuit, the Accardi doctrine extends beyond formal “regulations”\n6 to include, e.g., “internal operating procedures,” “handbook[s],” “policy\n7 statements,” and other materials that document an agency’s “usual practice.”\n8 Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing cases).3\n9 Finally, while the Court should be able to grant this motion based on Mr.\n10 Gonzalez’s non-constitutional APA claims, Defendants’ arguments in opposition\n11 to his due process claim also miss the mark. While arguing that Mr. Gonzalez\n12 lacks a protected property interest in his DACA status and associated benefits,\n13 Defendants acknowledge that an individual has a protected property interest in a\n14 government benefit where he or she has a “legitimate claim of entitlement” to that\n15 benefit. See Nozzi v. Housing Auth. of Los Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir.\n16 2015). The Ninth Circuit has explained that a person has a protected property right\n17 in government benefits where regulations “greatly restrict the discretion of the\n18 people who administer those benefits.” Id. There is no question that DACA\n19 recipients have a legitimate claim of entitlement to benefits conferred by the\n20 program because it is operated under a well-defined framework and governed by\n21 specific criteria that greatly restrict the discretion of those who administer it.\n22 Indeed, the DACA SOP provides “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions” for\n23 managing the program, Texas, 809 F.3d at 173, which are not discretionary and\n24\n25\n3 Defendants ignore Mr. Gonzalez’s remaining arbitrary and capricious arguments,\n26\nsee Dkt. No. 1-3 at 20-25, because permitting a CBP official’s issuance of an\n27\nunlawful presence NTA to simultaneously terminate DACA status (i.e., lawful\npresence) would so clearly fly in the face of the DACA program’s raison d’être\n28\nand eliminate its “rational operation.” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 58 (2011).\n9\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.558   Page 15 of 16\n1 apply “to all personnel performing adjudicative functions.” Coyotyl, 2017 WL\n2 2889861, at *4.\n3 Defendants’ remaining constitutional arguments simply mischaracterize Mr.\n4 Gonzalez’s due process claim. He does not premise his claim, for example, on a\n5 substantive right “to work in the United States without authorization.” Dkt. No. 9\n6 at 28. Rather, his claim is that once certain benefits, like employment\n7 authorization, are conferred, they cannot be terminated without due process. Bell\n8 v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971); Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Ct., 349 F.3d 1169, 1179\n9 (9th Cir. 2003). And for obvious reasons, Defendants do not even attempt to argue\n10 that they afforded Mr. Gonzalez due process in his DACA termination decision.\n11 IV. THE HARM IMPOSED BY DEFENDANTS IS IRREPARABLE\n12 Defendants argue that this Court should ignore the urgency underlying Mr.\n13 Gonzalez’s TRO application as of his own making. Nonsense. Mr. Gonzalez’s\n14 urgent need to have his DACA status restored before the October 5 final deadline\n15 for DACA renewal applications is solely the result of the current administration’s\n16 decision to wind down the DACA program and impose that deadline, which was\n17 announced for the first time on September 5. Mr. Gonzalez filed this case and his\n18 TRO application just six days later. Defendants also contend that Mr. Gonzalez’s\n19 not filing for DACA reinstatement for 16 months “casts doubt on his claim of\n20 harm.” Dkt. No. 9 at 19. The Court should reject this cruel argument out of hand.\n21 When USCIS terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status “automatically” and\n22 without prior notice, it told him that the decision was final and “[a]n appeal or\n23 motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.” Dkt. No. 1-19\n24 at 2. It is the ultimate “Catch-22” for Defendants now to argue that a layperson\n25 with a high school education, who was not represented by counsel for most of the\n26 time, should be penalized for taking USCIS at its word and not filing suit to\n27 challenge the termination at an earlier date. Of course, that is not the law.\n28\n10\nPLAINTIFF’SREPLYINSUPPORTOFEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARY\nRESTRAININGORDERAND/ORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 10   Filed 09/25/17   PageID.559   Page 16 of 16\nDated: September 25, 2017 Respectfully submitted,\n1\n2 /s/ John C.

INJUNCTION \n13\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF\nHOMELAND SECURITY; U.S.\n14\nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nSERVICES; U.S. IMMIGRATION\n15\nAND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT;\nand U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER\n16\nPROTECTION,\n17\nDefendants.\n18\nPlaintiff  Alberto  Luciano  Gonzalez  Torres  moves  to  modify  this  court’s\n19\nSeptember 29, 2017 Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Order”). \n20\nPlaintiff seeks to enjoin the expiration of the immigration and employment status he\n21\nobtained pursuant to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program. \n22\nDefendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration\n23\nServices (“USCIS”), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs\n24\nand Border Protection oppose the motion.  Having carefully considered the matter\n25\npresented, the court record, the arguments of counsel and, for the reasons set forth\n26\nbelow, the court denies the motion to modify the Order without prejudice.\n27\n28\n- 1 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 29   Filed 12/15/17   PageID.809   Page 2 of 4\n1 BACKGROUND\n2 The court incorporates its Order as if fully set forth herein.  In granting the\n3 motion for preliminary injunction, the court enjoined the termination of Plaintiff’s\n4 DACA status and employment authorization, required Defendants to comply with the\n5 DACA SOP, and ordered Defendants to accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application. \n6 Defendants represent that they have complied with the Order.  Defendants\n7 reinstated Plaintiff’s DACA status and employment authorization, accepted his DACA\n8 renewal request, and, on November 13, 2017, issued Plaintiff a Notice of Intent to\n9 Terminate (“NOIT”).  Plaintiff’s response to the NOIT is due on or before December\n10 16, 2017.  Moreover, Defendants represents that “USCIS anticipates completing the\n11 adjudication  of  its  intended  termination  of  Plaintiff’s  reinstated  DACA”  before\n12 expiration of Plaintiff’s DACA status on December 22, 2017.  \n13 THE MOTION\n14 The court possesses broad authority to modify preliminary injunctions “as\n15 required by the circumstances of a given case.”  United States v. Washington, 852 F.3d\n16 946, 979 (9th Cir. 2007) (a court “should not hesitate to modify its injunction” as\n17 required by the circumstances of the case).\n18 Plaintiff seeks to modify the Order to include a provision that would “enjoin the\n19 expiration of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment authorization pending\n20 final  resolution  of  his  renewal  application,”  including  the  time  spent  pursuing\n21 administrative and legal remedies.  (Motion at p.1:11-15).  Plaintiff represents that he\n22 timely filed a DACA renewal application on October 4, 2017, the processing of the\n23 renewal application by USCIS is anticipated to take between 120-150 days (between\n24 February and March 2018), and his current DACA status expires on December 22,\n25 2017.  Should the renewal application not be adjudicated prior to December 22, 2017,\n26 Plaintiff fears the loss of his DACA status and employment authorization at that time.\n27 Defendants represent that there is no need to modify the Order because Plaintiff\n28 has been provided with a NOIT and the opportunity to respond to the NOIT by\n- 2 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 29   Filed 12/15/17   PageID.810   Page 3 of 4\n1 December 16, 2017.  Presumably, the Government anticipates the termination of\n2 Plaintiff’s DACA status at that time.  Defendants anticipate resolving the NOIT and\n3 terminating  Plaintiff’s  DACA  status  prior  to  December  22,  2017,  thus  mooting\n4 Plaintiff’s request to extend Plaintiff’s DACA status beyond that date.1  They do not\n5 indicate whether Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application will be processed by December\n6 22, 2017.2\n7 At the outset, the court notes that the Order required Defendants to comply with\n8 the DACA SOP in seeking to terminate an individual’s DACA status.  To remedy the\n9 deficiencies identified by Plaintiff in his complaint, the court required Defendants to\n10 reinstate Plaintiff’s DACA status and employment authorization and to accept his\n11 DACA renewal application.  Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendants have complied\n12 with the Order.  \n13 While  Plaintiff  validly  expresses  insecurity  with  the  pace  of  Defendants’\n14 reported processing of DACA renewal applications, Defendants largely respond that,\n15 pursuant to the DACA SOP, Plaintiff’s DACA status will be lawfully resolved prior\n16 to  December  22,  2017,  by  properly  using  the  procedural  safeguards  of  the\n17 Administrative  Procedures  Act  and  the  DACA  SOP.    In  light  of  Defendants’\n18 representations, the court concludes that there is no reasonable or likely prospect that\n19 Defendants  will  improperly  detain  or  remove  Plaintiff  or  otherwise  improperly\n20 terminate Plaintiff’s DACA status. At this point in time, Plaintiff fails to meet his\n21 burden to show  that  modification  of the Order  is appropriate under  the current\n22 circumstances of the case.\n23\n1 The court rejects Defendants’ argument that the modification of the Order\n24 sought by Plaintiff deals with a new claim falling outside the scope of the present\ncomplaint.  The court construes Plaintiff’s complaint broadly, as this court is required\n25 to do.  See Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1500 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. dismissed, 116\nS. Ct. 1710 (1996) (courts must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to\n26 the plaintiff). \n27 2 In their December 8, 2017 sur-reply, Defendants represent that ICE issued\nDefendant a new NTA (this NTA relates to the removal proceedings commenced\n28 against Plaintiff in May 2016), clarifying DHS’s continuing interest in pursuing\nPlaintiff’s removal in support of the NOIT process.  \n- 3 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 29   Filed 12/15/17   PageID.811   Page 4 of 4\n1 In sum, the court denies the motion to modify the Order, without prejudice.3\n2 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n3 DATED: December 15, 2017\n4\n                                                                         \n5 JEFFREY T.

Having\n25 carefully considered the matter presented, the court record, the arguments of counsel\n26 and, for the reasons set forth below, the court grants the motion for preliminary\n27 injunction.  \n28 / / /\n- 1 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.561   Page 2 of 14\n1\n2 BACKGROUND\n3 On September 11, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this declaratory and injunctive\n4 relief action seeking a declaration that the automatic termination of his DACA status,\n5 without notice or an opportunity to contest the termination, (1) failed to comply with\n6 the DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOP”); (2) violated the arbitrary,\n7 capricious, and abuse of discretion standard of the Administrative Procedure Act\n8 (“APA”); and (3) violated Plaintiff’s Procedural Due Process rights under the Fifth\n9 Amendment.  \n10 Plaintiff Obtains DACA Status\n11 Plaintiff is a 24-year-old citizen of Mexico who was brought to the United States\n12 by his family when he was eight years old.  Plaintiff and his family entered the United\n13 States without authorization from the Attorney General.  Since his entry into the United\n14 States, Plaintiff has lived in San Diego, California where he graduated from Altus\n15 Charter High School in 2011.  From 2011 to 2013 Plaintiff was unable to obtain lawful\n16 employment due to his immigration status.  Plaintiff has no criminal convictions and\n17 had never been arrested until the 2016 detention in this case.\n18 In June 2012, the Obama Administration created a program which allowed\n19 certain immigrants to avoid deportation and obtain work permits for a period of two\n20 years, renewable upon good behavior.  The contours of the DACA program were set\n21 out in a June 15, 2012 Memorandum from former Secretary of the DHS, Janet\n22 Napolitano, and which became known as the “Napolitano Memo.”  The Napolitano\n23 Memo provided the criteria to be satisfied before an individual could be considered for\n24 an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  In broad brush, one qualified for DACA status\n25 upon showing that the individual:\n26 • entered the United States before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007; \n27 • lived continuously in the United States during the previous five years; \n28 • was currently in school, a high school graduate or was honorably discharged\n- 2 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.562   Page 3 of 14\n1 from the military;\n2 • was under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; and \n3 • not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three other\n4 misdemeanors, nor posed a threat to national or public safety.  \n5 The program did not, and still does not, provide lawful status or a path to\n6 citizenship, nor, among other things, does it provide eligibility for federal welfare or\n7 student aid.  (Pls. Exh. B).\n8 In early 2013, satisfying all prerequisites for DACA status, Plaintiff applied for,\n9 and  was  granted,  DACA  status.    Having  obtained  DACA  status,  Plaintiff  was\n10 considered “lawfully present” in the country and granted an Employment Authorization\n11 Document (“EAD”) and Social Security Number, so that Plaintiff could be lawfully\n12 employed.  The approval letter issued by USCIS informed Plaintiff that “in the exercise\n13 of its prosecutorial discretion, [USCIS] has decided to defer action on” his case for a\n14 period of two years.  “Deferred action does not confer or alter any immigration status.” \n15 (Pl. Exh. I).  In 2014, DHS renewed Plaintiff’s DACA status.\n16 Upon receipt of DACA status, Plaintiff obtained full-time employment in the\n17 airline food packaging industry and worked in that industry from 2013 until May 2016,\n18 working the 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. shift.  The hiring process involved interviews, drug\n19 tests, background checks, and verification of employment authorization.  Plaintiff used\n20 a portion of his income to financially support his family.  In May 2016, Plaintiff’s\n21 DACA status was purportedly revoked by the USCIS in a Notice of Action.  Plaintiff\n22 informed his employer of the loss of DACA status and was terminated.  The employer\n23 informed Plaintiff that he could re-apply for employment once he obtains work\n24 authorization.  \n25 Revocation of DACA Status\n26 On May 6, 2016, Plaintiff declares that an acquaintance named Adolfo asked\n27 him, as he had in the past, to look after his dogs while he was out of town.  Plaintiff\n28 went to Adolfo’s home, took care of the dogs, and encountered two other individuals\n- 3 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.563   Page 4 of 14\n1 at the home.  Plaintiff planned to have his sister pick him up from Adolfo’s house and\n2 drive him to work by 7:00 p.m., the shift start time.  At 4:00 p.m., a few hours after\n3 arriving at Adolfo’s house, USCBP officers knocked on the door and asked Plaintiff\n4 if they could search the premises.   He informed the USCBP officers that they needed\n5 a search warrant to enter the home as he did not believe he “had permission to let them\n6 in because it was not my house.”  (Gonzalez Decl. ¶11).  The Officers did not enter the\n7 home, but remained outside.\n8 Around 5:00 p.m. a man not known to Plaintiff arrived, represented that he was\n9 the owner of the house, and asked Plaintiff to exit his home.  Outside the home,\n10 Plaintiff  was interviewed by USCBP officers and informed them that he possessed\n11 DACA  status  and  a  valid  EAD.    According  to  Plaintiff,  he  was  then  arrested,\n12 handcuffed, and spent the next two days being “aggressively” interrogated by two\n13 officers.  The officers asked him about “wrongdoing at the house that I did not\n14 understand.  I kept asking them for details and telling them, ‘I don’t understand why\n15 I’m being detained.’” (Id. ¶18).  “No one interrogated [Plaintiff] after those first two\n16 or three days,” or after his release from custody.\n17 After two or three days, Plaintiff was transferred to another facility.  On June 1,\n18 2016,  Plaintiff  was  provided  with  a  bond  hearing  before  Immigration  Judge\n19 McSeveney, and released two days later on a $5,000 bond.  In the sixteen months since\n20 his release, Plaintiff has not had any law enforcement contacts.  At oral argument, the\n21 court was advised the matter of Plaintiff’s removal is still pending.\n22 To provide additional context to Plaintiff’s declaration, Defendants represent that\n23 Plaintiff (and another individual arrested at the searched house) was arrested on May\n24 6, 2016, for harboring illegal aliens in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and\n25 §1182(a)(6)(E)(i).  Once the owner of the home arrived at Adolfo’s residence, the\n26 owner consented to permit USCBP agents to search the residence (the renters were not\n27 at home).  Inside, USCBP discovered 12 illegal aliens (five from China and seven from\n28 Mexico) hiding in the attic. The record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien  documents\n- 4 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.564   Page 5 of 14\n1 indicate that three material witnesses identified Plaintiff as the individual who told\n2 them to hide in the attic.\n3 On May 7, 2016, USCIS issued Plaintiff a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) charging\n4 him as “inadmissible” to the United States  (i.e. Plaintiff was deemed unlawfully\n5 present in the country) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i).  On May 23, 2016,\n6 USCIS provided Plaintiff with a Notice of Action informing him that his DACA status\n7 and employment authorization had been automatically terminated as of the date of the\n8 NTA (May 7, 2016).  The Notice of Action also informed Plaintiff that an appeal or\n9 motion to reopen/reconsider “may not be filed.”  (Pls. Exh. N).    \n10 The DACA SOP\n11 The DACA SOP issued by DHS sets forth the procedures for adjudicating\n12 DACA applications, renewals, and the termination of participation in DACA.  In\n13 pertinent  part,  the  DACA  SOP  outlines  four  procedures  to  be  followed  upon\n14 termination or revocation of DACA status.  First, in the event an immigration officer\n15 learns that DACA status was either erroneously or fraudulently issued to a DACA\n16 recipient,  the agency issues a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) to the recipient. \n17 The NOIT provides notice that, upon termination of DACA status, the recipient will\n18 lose employment authorization.  The DACA SOP provides that the NOIT must inform\n19 the recipient that he or she has “33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the\n20 grounds cited in the” NOIT.  (Pls. Exh.F at 136).  \n21 Second, the DACA SOP also provides that criminal offenses or public safety\n22 concerns deemed to be Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) cases, as defined in the\n23 November 7, 2011 Memorandum for EPS cases (“2011 Memorandum”), may serve as\n24 a basis to terminate DACA status.  Once the underlying conduct is found to be an EPS\n25 case, the officer then forwards the case to the Background Check Unit DACA Team\n26 (“BCU”)  who,  in  turn,  forwards  the  case  to  ICE  for  application  of  the  2011\n27 Memorandum. In the event ICE accepts the case and issues an NTA, the recipient will\n28 automatically lose DACA status.  Additionally, upon filing the NTA with EOIR\n- 5 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.565   Page 6 of 14\n1 (Executive Office for Immigration Review), the recipient’s employment authorization\n2 terminates automatically.  (Id. at 137).  \n3 Third, in the event ICE does not accept the EPS case, or the underlying offense\n4 is non-EPS conduct, BCU DACA Team is instructed to reopen the case and issue a\n5 NOIT.  The individual then has 33 days to submit a brief contesting the grounds for\n6 removal identified in the NOIT.\n7 Fourth, in the event USCIS determines, after consulting with ICE, that exercising\n8 prosecutorial discretion is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement policies, and ICE\n9 does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer refers the matter through the normal chain of\n10 command to Headquarters Service Center Operations (“HSCO”).  In the event HSCO\n11 determines that the case warrants final termination, the DACA recipient must be\n12 provided with DACA Form 603, and an opportunity to respond. \n13 In short, except in EPS cases, the DACA SOP requires notice and an ability to\n14 contest the NOIT before DACA status may be terminated.  In EPS cases, DACA status\n15 is automatically revoked once ICE accepts the case and issues a NTA.  However, as set\n16 forth in the November 7, 2011 Policy Memorandum, an NTA can only by issued by\n17 USCIS under limited circumstances not applicable here (in cases involving modifying\n18 conditions of residency, denial of Form I-829, termination of refugee status, adjustment\n19 of status denials, and asylum).  (Pls. Exh. G). It is undisputed that Defendants did not\n20 comply with any of the specified DACA termination provisions, including the referral\n21 of the case to ICE for a decision on the issuance of an NTA.  \n22 Recent DACA Related Events\n23 On September 5, 2017, Defendant DHS announced a plan to eliminate DACA,\n24 beginning in March 2018.  Current DACA recipients whose status expires on or before\n25 March 5, 2018, may apply for a two-year renewal, but renewal applications are due on\n26 or before October 5, 2017.\n27 In light of the numerous recent government issued memoranda concerning\n28 modifications to immigration policies, laws, regulations and procedures, the court notes\n- 6 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.566   Page 7 of 14\n1 that these memoranda preserve the DACA program.  For example, on February 20,\n2 2017, the Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly issued an implementing\n3 Memorandum  stating  that  DHS  “will  no  longer  exempt  classes  or  categories  of\n4 removable aliens from potential enforcement.”  However, the memorandum specifically \n5 left  intact  the  DACA  program.    On  June  15,  2017,  Secretary  Kelly  issued  a\n6 memorandum rescinding the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful\n7 Permanent Residents (“DAPA”), but temporarily leaving the DACA program in place. \n8 (Pls. Exh. A).\n9 In light of the announced elimination of DACA, and the October 5, 2017 deadline\n10 for renewals under DACA, Plaintiff seeks expedited relief to enjoin Defendants from\n11 enforcing the termination of his DACA status in order to permit him to file a DACA\n12 renewal application.  On September 21, 2017, the court entered an Amended Scheduling\n13 Order setting the matter for oral argument on September 28, 2017.\n14 DISCUSSION\n15 Legal Standards\n16 To obtain preliminary or temporary injunctive relief, the party must satisfy one\n17 of two tests: (1) a combination of probable success and the possibility of irreparable\n18 harm, or (2) the party raises serious questions and the balance of hardship tips in its\n19 favor.  Arcamuzi v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 937 (9th Cir. 1987).\n20 \"These two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required\n21 degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.\"  Id.  Under\n22 both formulations, however, the party must demonstrate a \"fair chance of success on the\n23 merits\" and a \"significant threat of irreparable injury.\"  Id; Miller v. California Pac.\n24 Med. Ctr., 19 F.3d 449, 456 (9th Cir. 1994 (en banc).  The court also considers the\n25 public interest in the issues raised by the parties.  Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20\n26 (2008).1\n27\n28\n1 Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a), the court treats Plaintiff’s motion as one for\npreliminary injunctive relief.\n- 7 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.567   Page 8 of 14\n1 Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n2 Defendants contend that the jurisdictional stripping provision of the Immigration\n3 and Naturalization Act prevents this court from reviewing Plaintiff’s claim.  The statute\n4 provides:\n5 Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision\nof law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or\n6 any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such\ntitle, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on\n7 behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney\nGeneral to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal\n8 orders against any alien under this chapter. \n9 8 U.S.C. §1252(g).  The parties do not dispute that, as stated in the statute, this court\n10 does not have jurisdiction to entertain claims “arising from the decision or action by the\n11 Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders\n12 against any alien.”  Id.  Under this provision, the court is stripped of jurisdiction to\n13 entertain Defendants’ ultimate discretionary determination as to Plaintiff’s DACA\n14 status.  However, Defendants misconstrue §1252(g).  \n15 Section 1252(g) must be construed narrowly and “applies only to three discrete\n16 actions. . . ‘to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’” \n17 Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 963-64 (9th Cir. 2004); Coyotl v. Kelly, 2017 WL\n18 2889681 (N.D. GA. June 12, 2017) (jurisdictional stripping provision does not bar the\n19 exercise of jurisdiction over claim that termination of DACA status occurred without\n20 following the non-discretionary termination provisions of the DACA SOP); (United\n21 States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (district court may consider\n22 “a purely legal conclusion that does not challenge the Attorney General’s discretionary\n23 authority, even if the answer . . . forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General\n24 later will exercise discretionary authority”); Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 1001,\n25 1004 (9th Cir. 2003) (courts “retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims, even\n26 when those claim address [agency] discretion”).  Accordingly, this provision does not\n27 deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff’s claim that the termination of his\n28 DACA status did not comply with the non-discretionary DACA SOP.\n- 8 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.568   Page 9 of 14\n1 Similarly, the provision related to the review of orders of removal, 8 U.S.C.\n2 §1252(b)(9), does not prevent the court from entertaining Plaintiff’s claims.  Here, there\n3 is no final order of removal entered against Plaintiff and no proceedings have been\n4 commenced against Plaintiff.  As noted in Sing v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir.\n5 2007), §1252(b)(9) “appl[ies] only to those claims seeking judicial review of orders of\n6 removal.”  Here, Plaintiff brings a procedural challenge to termination of his DACA\n7 status, an issue independent from any removal proceedings.  Accordingly, this provision\n8 does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff’s claim.\n9 In sum, the court concludes that it possesses jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff’s\n10 claims.\n11 Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n12 Both Counts One and Two in the complaint seek relief pursuant to the APA, 5\n13 U.S.C. §702, based upon Defendants failure to comply with the DACA SOP when\n14 terminating Plaintiff’s DACA status.  Under the APA, “[a] person suffering legal wrong\n15 because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within\n16 the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. §702.  The\n17 APA further states “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action\n18 for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.” \n19 Id. § 704.  Section 706 instructs the court reviewing agency action to “decide all\n20 relevant  questions  of  law,  interpret  constitutional  and  statutory  provisions,  and\n21 determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  Not only shall\n22 the reviewing court compel agency action unlawfully withheld but shall also “hold\n23 unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be – (A)\n24 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n25 Id. §§706(1) and (2)(A).  \n26 The court concludes that Defendants’ failure to follow the termination procedures\n27 set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.  See U.S.\n28 ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954) Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d\n- 9 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.569   Page 10 of 14\n1 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (an agency’s failure to follow its own procedures is a\n2 sufficient ground to set aside agency action).  Two of the four DACA SOP termination\n3 procedures require the appropriate agency to provide the DACA recipient with a NOIT\n4 identifying the grounds for termination and providing 33 days to file a brief or statement\n5 contesting the grounds.  (Pls. Exh. F at 136-37).  Defendants did not comply with this\n6 procedure in the DACA SOP.  One other means of terminating DACA status is to refer\n7 the matter to HSCO which then determines whether the case warrants final termination. \n8 If so, the DACA recipient must be provided with DACA Form 603, and an opportunity\n9 to respond.  Defendants did not comply with this procedure in the DACA SOP.  Lastly,\n10 while DACA status may be terminated by ICE in an EPS case, the Notice received by\n11 Plaintiff identified his presence in the United States without being admitted or paroled\n12 in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as the grounds for removal.   A violation of\n13 that  provision  does  not  constitute  an  EPS  case  because  the  2011  Memorandum \n14 identifies  only  certain  aggravated  felony  alien  smuggling  offenses  (8  U.S.C.\n15 §1001(a)(43)(N)) as disqualifying criminal conduct.  Unlawful presence in violation of\n16 §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) is not an aggravated felony.  Accordingly, the court concludes that\n17 Defendants have failed to follow their own procedures in terminating Plaintiff’s DACA\n18 status.\n19 Defendants broadly argue that the DHS possesses such broad prosecutorial\n20 discretion that they need not follow the DACA SOP in terminating the status of DACA\n21 recipients.  The court categorically rejects this proposition.  While Defendants are\n22 granted broad discretion to commence, adjudicate, and execute removal orders, a\n23 fundamental principle of federal law is that a federal agency must follow its own\n24 procedures.  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 233-35 (1974) (“[W]here the rights of\n25 individuals  are  affected,  it  is  incumbent  upon  agencies  to  follow  their  own\n26 procedures.”);  Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802, 809 (9th Cir.1979) (holding that INS\n27 violated its own regulation in processing a non-citizen's request for immigration\n28 records); United States v. Heffner, 420 F.2d 809 (4th Cir. 1969) (courts must overturn\n- 10 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.570   Page 11 of 14\n1 agency actions which do not scrupulously follow the regulations and procedures\n2 promulgated by the agency itself).  In Accardi, 347 U.S. 260, the petitioner alleged that\n3 the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals  (“BIA”)  failed  to  exercise  its  discretion  in\n4 determining his application for suspension of deportation.  Id. at 261.  Petitioner alleged\n5 that the BIA deferred to the decision of the Attorney General and, therefore, did not\n6 exercise its own regulatory discretion in determining his application.  The BIA denied\n7 petitioner’s application allegedly because petitioner’s name was on a list of immigrants\n8 the Attorney General wanted deported.  The regulatory scheme required the BIA to\n9 exercise its own judgment when considering immigration appeals, and not to rely upon\n10 the Attorney General’s determinations.  The Supreme Court reversed the BIA’s denial\n11 of the application and remanded for further proceedings because the BIA allegedly\n12 failed to exercise its own discretion as required by its own relevant regulations.  \n13 Defendants further contend, in essence, the NTA issued by USCBP in connection\n14 with    removal  proceedings  for  Plaintiff  was  tantamount  to  ICE  issuing  a  NTA\n15 terminating DACA status pursuant to the DACA SOP.  But this position is indefensible\n16 for several reasons.  First, as discussed elsewhere in this order, the NTA for removal\n17 proceedings was predicated upon the “ground” of being illegally present, a charge that\n18 is not an aggravated felony for purposes of EPS rules.   See 8 U.S.C. §1001(a)(43)(N);\n19 Pls. Exh. G at pp. 61-62.  Second, contrary to defendants’ position that immigration\n20 removal proceedings are the proper forum for Plaintiff to raise his DACA termination\n21 status, an immigration judge has no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or to\n22 authorize an application for renewal of DACA status, as acknowledged by Defendants\n23 at oral argument.  Basically, Defendants’ argument that a USCBP issued NTA for\n24 removal purposes is the equivalent of an ICE issued NTA for an EPS case under DACA\n25 has no basis in law.  The two NTAs are not fungible, or “flip sides of the same coin,”\n26 as advanced by Defendants at oral argument.\n27 Here, Defendants have failed to present any evidence that they complied with the\n28 termination of DACA status provisions set forth in the DACA SOP.  Moreover, Plaintiff\n- 11 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.571   Page 12 of 14\n1 has made a strong showing that he is likely to prevail on his APA claim that Defendants\n2 acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and abused their discretion by failing to follow the\n3 DACA SOP.  \n4 In sum, the court concludes that Plaintiff has made a strong showing that he is\n5 likely to prevail on the merits. \n6 Procedural Due Process\n7 Because the court resolved Plaintiff’s claims based upon a statutory analysis, the\n8 court does not reach the claim that Defendants violated his Fifth Amendment procedural\n9 due process rights.  In any event, the court notes that the remedy for violation of the\n10 DACA SOP - - notice and an opportunity to contest administrative action - - is an\n11 equivalent remedy available under the due process clause.\n12 Irreparable Harm\n13 The court concludes that Plaintiff will suffer significant irreparable harm in the\n14 absence of an injunction by losing his DACA status and the ability to apply for renewal\n15 of that status.  The potential harm caused by Defendants’ conduct includes the loss of\n16 employment, a core benefit under DACA.  The deprivation of employment impacts\n17 Plaintiff’s ability to financially provide for himself and his family.  See Cleveland Bd.\n18 Of Ed. v. Laudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (loss of livelihood is a severe harm). \n19 The loss of DACA status also undermines one’s sense of well-being and subjects\n20 Plaintiff to a constant threat of apprehension and possible removal from the only\n21 country he has called home.  This threatened harm far exceeds any harm suffered by the\n22 government.  This court is simply requiring Defendants to follow their own procedural\n23 dictates for termination of DACA status by essentially giving Plaintiff a meaningful\n24 opportunity to be heard before any determination to terminate his DACA status is made. \n25 Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s pursuit of a legal remedy 16 months after his\n26 DACA status was terminated undermines his claim of irreparable harm.  This argument\n27 is not persuasive.  The precipitating event giving rise to the present action is the\n28 September 5, 2017 announcement by DHS that the DACA program is being phased out\n- 12 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.572   Page 13 of 14\n1 and  any  DACA  renewals  had  to  be  filed  on  October  5,  2017.    Under  these\n2 circumstances, Plaintiff’s pursuit of this action is timely.\n3 In sum, Plaintiff has demonstrated a significant threat of irreparable harm.  \n4 The Public Interest  \n5 The court concludes that the public interest consideration is multi-faceted and\n6 difficult to assess in light of the current political situation.  There is no doubt that there\n7 is strong interest in enforcing U.S. immigration laws effectively and consistently.  On\n8 the other hand, the public has a strong interest in the fair and even-handed treatment of\n9 immigrants.  The court also notes that (1) DACA and DACA recipients have strong\n10 national support as reflected in numerous public opinion polls, as well as broad political\n11 support, and (2) the political process may comprehensively address the DACA program\n12 in the foreseeable future.  \n13 In sum, at the present time, this factor neither strongly favors one side nor the\n14 other.  \n15 The Balance of Equities\n16 Applying the Arcamuzi balancing test, Plaintiff has made a strong showing of the\n17 likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm such that entry of a preliminary\n18 injunction is warranted under the circumstances.\n19 CONCLUSION\n20 For  the  reasons  set  forth  herein,  the  court  Grants  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for\n21 Preliminary Injunction and\n22 (1) Orders that Defendants’ May 7, 2016 revocation of Plaintiff’s DACA status\n23 is vacated and Defendants are preliminary enjoined from enforcing the said revocation; \n24 (2) Orders that Defendants’ termination of Plaintiff’s EAD is vacated and\n25 Defendants  are  preliminarily  enjoined  from  terminating  Plaintiff’s  employment\n26 authorization;\n27 (3) Orders that Defendants shall fully comply with the DACA SOP should\n28 Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status; and \n- 13 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 12   Filed 09/29/17   PageID.573   Page 14 of 14\n1 (4) Orders that Defendants accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application.  \n2 Finally, this order is to remain in effect pending further Order of this court. \n3 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n4 DATED:  September 29, 2017\n5\n   Hon.

INTRODUCTION\n1\nOn December 21, 2017, just three days after receiving Plaintiff Alberto\n2\nLuciano Gonzalez Torres’s response to USCIS’s Notice of Intent to Terminate\n3\n(“NOIT”) his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) status and\n4\nEmployment Authorization Document (“EAD”), Defendants terminated Mr.\n5\nGonzalez’s status—24 hours before it was set to expire anyway. It was the second\n6\ntime Defendants have attempted to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status. In\n7\nSeptember, this Court vacated and preliminarily enjoined Defendants’ first\n8\ntermination as unlawful and a violation of Defendants’ own DACA Standard\n9\nOperating Procedures (“SOP”) and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).\n10\nThe Court explained that the harms flowing from Mr. Gonzalez “losing his DACA\n11\nstatus and ability to apply for renewal of that status,” including losing the right to\n12\nlive and work lawfully in the United States, were irreparable. Accordingly, the\n13\nCourt ordered, in part, that (1) “Defendants shall fully comply with the DACA\n14\nSOP should Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status,” (2)\n15\n“Defendants accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application,” and (3) the Court’s\n16\nPreliminary Injunction “is to remain in effect pending further Order of this court.”\n17\nSix weeks later, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a bare-bones NOIT, seeking to\n18\nterminate his DACA status and EAD without any explanation of the factors it\n19\nwould consider in reviewing his response. Mr. Gonzalez responded with an\n20\nexplanation of the NOIT’s deficiencies and an explicit and unambiguous denial of\n21\nany connection to what he surmised USCIS might consider in that review, i.e., its\n22\npurported suspicion of criminality—which, because he has never been charged\n23\nwith a crime (or even investigated in nearly two years) has never been tested in any\n24\ncompetent forum—stemming from his arrest in May 2016 by CBP officers.\n25\nUltimately, USCIS purported to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD\n26\nbecause: (1) he is in removal proceedings solely for unlawful presence in the\n27\n28\n1\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.954   Page 8 of 37\n1 United States, and (2) his DACA status “is not consistent with [DHS’s]\n2 enforcement priorities.”\n3 USCIS’s second effort to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status\n4 demonstrates, yet again, Defendants’ disregard or misreading of the plain language\n5 of the Court’s Order, the DACA SOP, and DHS’s publicly defined and reaffirmed\n6 “enforcement priorities.” The Court ordered Defendants to “fully” comply with\n7 the SOP if they reconsidered Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status. But Defendants have\n8 not complied with the SOP. The issuance of a bare-bones NOIT, an opportunity to\n9 respond (without the benefit of knowing which aspects of Mr. Gonzalez’s history\n10 would bear on the decision), and the issuance of a termination notice do not\n11 constitute compliance, where, as here, Defendants’ stated reasons do not fall within\n12 any of the SOP’s clearly defined bases for termination.\n13 The SOP’s Termination chapter identifies six potential bases for DACA\n14 termination. USCIS’s second purported termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n15 status fits none of them. Merely being in removal proceedings for unlawful\n16 presence does not support termination, given that DACA expressly contemplates\n17 extending benefits even to those who have had final orders of removal issued\n18 against them. Nor, according to DHS’s own policies, does mere suspicion of\n19 wrongdoing flowing from a May 2016 arrest that led to no charge or conviction\n20 and has not even been investigated in more than a year and a half, especially in the\n21 absence of a stated public safety concern.\n22 In short, the DACA SOP does not countenance termination (1) for a DACA\n23 recipient with no criminal charges or convictions (2) on the basis of a USCIS\n24 officer’s informal evaluation of criminality (3) without any stated public safety\n25 concern (4) following an NOIT that did not explain what factors would be\n26 considered in its review.\n27 Moreover, if the Court determines that USCIS’s purported termination is not\n28 a violation of the DACA Memo and DACA SOP or otherwise arbitrary and\n2\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.955   Page 9 of 37\n1 capricious, the termination and denial of renewal should nevertheless be set aside\n2 for failure to comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Mr.\n3 Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD confer liberty and property interests, including\n4 the right to live and work lawfully in the United States and the opportunity for\n5 renewal upon consideration of the DACA criteria. Their termination requires an\n6 adequate procedure and a meaningful opportunity to respond, which Mr. Gonzalez\n7 has not received. Even if the DACA program could countenance such a result, the\n8 Fifth Amendment cannot.\n9 The Court should reject Defendants’ motion to dissolve its Preliminary\n10 Injunction and their request to permit their unlawful termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n11 DACA status and EAD to take effect. In addition, Mr. Gonzalez seeks a\n12 preliminary injunction vacating and enjoining the purported termination, as well as\n13 the purported subsequent denial of his DACA renewal application, which by its\n14 own terms is premised on nothing more than the unlawful purported termination.1\nII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n15\nA. TERMS OF THE DACA PROGRAM\n16\nOn June 15, 2012, DHS announced the terms of the DACA program. See\n17\nDeclaration of John C. Ulin (“Ulin Dec.”; filed concurrently), Ex. A, “Exercising\n18\nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United\n19\nStates as Children” (“DACA Memo”). The DACA Memo explains that the\n20\n“Nation’s immigration laws . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without\n21\nconsideration given to the individual circumstances of each case,” and that\n22\n“additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are\n23\nnot expended on [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on\n24\npeople who meet our enforcement priorities.” Its purpose is to protect “certain\n25\nyoung people who were brought to this country as children and know only this\n26\n27 1 This request for a preliminary injunction has no bearing on the Court’s current\nInjunction. Their terms are not mutually exclusive. And the harms at issue here flow\n28 both from Defendants’ conduct in November and December 2017 and their unlawful\nactions in 2016 that gave rise to the current Injunction.\n3\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.956   Page 10 of 37\n1 country as home [because] these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law.”\n2 A DACA recipient who meets the following objectively verifiable criteria is, by\n3 definition, a “low priority case” and does not “meet [DHS’s] enforcement\n4 priorities.” The relevant criteria are that the recipient:\n5  came to the United States under the age of 16;\n6  continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding the\ndate of the DACA Memo and was present in the United States on the date of the\n7 DACA Memo;\n8  is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general\neducation development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the\n9 Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;\n10  “has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense,\nor multiple misdemeanor offenses,” and does not “otherwise pose[] a threat to\n11 national security or public safety”; and\n12  is not above the age of 30.\n13 DACA renewal applicants must continue to meet these criteria. Both DACA\n14 applicants and renewal applicants “must undergo biographic and biometric\n15 background checks.” Ulin Dec., Ex. B, “DACA FAQ,” Q22.\n16 USCIS is charged with implementing the terms of the DACA program in a\n17 manner consistent with the DACA Memo and subsequent DHS guidance. Since\n18 DACA’s inception, the objective criteria above have served as the determinative\n19 basis for USCIS’s DACA decisions. See Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 171-76 (5th\n20 Cir. 2015) (“[d]enials are recorded in a ‘check the box’ standardized form, for\n21 which USCIS personnel are provided templates”). To govern application,\n22 termination, and renewal decisions, Defendants promulgated the DACA SOP and\n23 the DACA FAQ. “The SOP states that it is applicable to all personnel performing\n24 adjudicative functions and the procedures to be followed are not discretionary.”\n25 Coyotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1334 (N.D. Ga. 2017). For these reasons,\n26 this Court “categorically reject[ed]” the proposition that Defendants “need not\n27 follow the DACA SOP in terminating the status of DACA recipients.” Gonzalez\n28 Torres v. DHS, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017); see id. at *5\n4\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.957   Page 11 of 37\n1 (“Defendants’ failure to follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA\n2 SOP is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”). Defendants themselves\n3 have confirmed that conclusion. Coyotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1334 (“confirmation\n4 from counsel for Defendants that ‘[t]hey are the guidelines that adjudicators are to\n5 apply’”).\n6 B. CONTINUATION OF THE DACA PROGRAM’S TERMS\n7 DHS began a rescission and wind-down of the DACA program on\n8 September 5, 2017. See Ulin Dec., Ex. C, “Memorandum on Rescission of\n9 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” (“Rescission Memo”). Before and after\n10 the rescission announcement, DHS has explained repeatedly that the rules\n11 governing the DACA program and DACA recipients have not changed, and that\n12 DACA recipients would not be deemed “enforcement priorities” in a manner that\n13 deviates from how that term has been defined in the DACA program since 2012:\n14  On February 20, 2017, DHS issued a memorandum defining its new\nimmigration enforcement priorities:\n15\nWith the exception of the June 15, 2012, memorandum\n16 entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect\nto Individuals Who Came to the United States as\n17 Children” [i.e., the DACA Memo,] . . . all existing\nconflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance\n18 regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and\npriorities for removal are hereby immediately rescinded—to\n19 the extent of the conflict.\n20 See Ulin Dec., Ex. D, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the\nNational Interest” (“Kelly Memo”) (emphasis added).\n21\n The Kelly Memo prioritizes enforcement against individuals who “have been\n22 charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved” or allegedly\n“committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” But by the\n23 Memo’s own terms, the directive that individuals be deemed enforcement\npriorities based on alleged offenses or suspicions of wrongdoing, without\n24 convictions, adverse judicial adjudications, or even criminal charges, does not\napply to DACA recipients, who continue to be governed by the DACA Memo,\n25 DACA SOP, and DACA FAQ. See id. (“Except as specifically noted above\n[i.e., as required by the DACA Memo], the Department no longer will exempt\n26 classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.”)\n(emphasis added).\n27\n On February 21, 2017, DHS again unequivocally explained that the Kelly\n28 Memo’s enforcement priorities have no bearing on DACA recipients:\n5\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.958   Page 12 of 37\n1 Q22: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred\nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?\n2 A22: No.\n3 Ulin Dec., Ex. E, “Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on\nEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.”\n4\n On June 15, 2017, DHS issued more public guidance, explaining that “DACA\n5 recipients will continue to be eligible as outlined in the June 15, 2012\nmemorandum.” Ulin Dec., Ex. F, “Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of\n6 Memorandum Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\nLawful Permanent Residents (‘DAPA’)” (emphasis added).\n7\n Following the rescission, on September 8, 2017, the administration explained\n8 DHS’s policy that “[d]uring this six-month time, there are no changes that are\nbeing made to the program at this point.” Ulin Dec., Ex. G, “Press Briefing by\n9 Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert.”\n10  And again on October 3, 2017, DHS assured the Senate Judiciary Committee\nregarding its enforcement priorities:\n11\nWe rely on guidance that was put in place in 2012 when\n12 the DACA program was initiated. That’s available on\nUSCIS’s website and will tell you what the priorities are\n13 for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and what they\nare for the Department at large. Those priorities have not\n14 changed.\n15 Testimony of Michael Dougherty, Assistant Secretary of DHS at 01:10:20,\n“Oversight of the Administration’s Decision to End Deferred Action for\n16 Childhood Arrivals,” available at https://bit.ly/2fzVNEY; id. at 01:11:00 (the\nKelly Memo “carved out” DACA from its enforcement priorities; “I would tell\n17 you in good faith and complete confidence that we are relying on the same\npriorities that were in place in 2012 and we have not added to them for this\n18 population.”).\n19 In short, under Defendants’ own binding procedures, DACA recipients who\n20 meet the DACA Memo’s objectively verifiable eligibility criteria—i.e., have no\n21 disqualifying criminal offenses and do not pose a threat to public safety—remain\n22 “low priority cases,” and their removal remains inconsistent with DHS’s\n23 enforcement priorities. DHS has made other changes to the DACA program\n24 during its wind-down (e.g., elimination of advance parole) and has re-defined\n25 enforcement priorities for non-DACA recipients. But it has not instructed ICE or\n26 USCIS to re-define the prioritization of DACA recipients for removal. To the\n27 contrary, DHS has reaffirmed that DACA recipients will not be prioritized in a\n28 manner inconsistent with the DACA program as it has existed since 2012.\n6\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.959   Page 13 of 37\nC. CONSTRAINTS ON DEFENDANTS’ DISCRETION IN\n1 IMPLEMENTING THE TERMS OF THE DACA PROGRAM\n2 DACA recipients and renewal applicants remain subject to the heavily\n3 circumscribed discretion of USCIS personnel, who must act in accordance with:\n4 (1) DHS’s 2012 DACA Memo, which declares DHS’s non-prioritization of\n5 individuals who meet the five objectively verifiable criteria that make a DACA\n6 recipient a “low priority” and have always formed the basis for USCIS’s DACA\n7 status decisions;\n8 (2) Defendants’ DACA SOP, which sets forth the mandatory termination\n9 procedures and enumerates the six permissible bases for termination that USCIS\n10 personnel must follow with regard to DACA applicants and recipients;\n11 (3) USCIS’s November 7, 2011 Policy Memorandum (“Revised Guidance\n12 for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases\n13 Involving Inadmissible and Removable Aliens”), Ulin Dec., Ex. H (“USCIS\n14 Memo”)—which the DACA SOP incorporates as mandatory procedures for certain\n15 termination decisions;\n16 (4) USCIS’s DACA FAQ document, which (i) explains that DACA\n17 recipients are “not unlawfully present”; (ii) directs ICE and CBP “to prevent\n18 qualifying individuals from being apprehended, placed into removal proceedings,\n19 or removed”; and (iii) requires consideration of the DACA criteria for applicants\n20 who are in removal proceedings, have a final order of removal, or have a voluntary\n21 departure order, Ulin Dec., Ex. B, “DACA FAQ,” Q1, Q9, Q10; and\n22 (5) DHS’s Kelly Memo and accompanying statements explaining its scope,\n23 which make clear that the DACA Memo, DAC SOP, DACA FAQ, and any\n24 guidelines incorporated or encompassed by those documents continue to govern\n25 the rights of DACA recipients and the scenarios in which Defendants may deem\n26 them enforcement priorities—i.e., disqualifying criminal history and/or public\n27\n28\n7\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.960   Page 14 of 37\n1 safety concerns, and not alleged offenses or suspicions of wrongdoing without\n2 conviction or other neutral adjudication, or stated public safety concerns.\n3 D. MANDATORY DACA TERMINATION GUIDELINES\n4 DHS’s DACA SOP establishes the terms governing Defendants’\n5 implementation of the DACA program and the potential bases for DACA status\n6 and EAD termination. See Ulin Dec., Ex. I, Aug. 28, 2013 DACA SOP. As\n7 explained by this and other courts, the SOP is binding on all agencies and\n8 personnel administering the terms of the program. See, e.g., Dkt. 12 at 5-6. The\n9 SOP incorporates the 2011 USCIS Memo, and adopts its mandatory guidelines for\n10 certain DACA termination decisions. Ulin Dec., Ex. H, USCIS Memo. Where\n11 termination is concerned, Chapter 14 of the DACA SOP and the incorporated 2011\n12 USCIS Memo provide six potential bases for termination, and the procedures to be\n13 followed when each potential basis is implicated:\n(1) “If it comes to the attention of an officer that removal was deferred under\n14\nDACA in error, the officer should reopen the case on Service motion and issue” an\nNOIT, with 33 days to overcome the “grounds cited.”\n15\n(2) “If it comes to the attention of an officer that an individual committed fraud in\n16\nseeking deferral of removal under DACA, the officer should reopen the case on\nService motion and issue” an NOIT, with 33 days to overcome the “grounds cited.”\n17\n(3) Generally, “[i]f disqualifying criminal offenses or public safety concerns . . .\n18\narise after” DACA status is granted, the recipient must receive an NOIT and “33\ndays to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited.”\n19\n(4) If USCIS suspects an Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) concern, it must send\n20\nthe case to the Background Check Unit DACA Team (“BCU”), which must refer\nthe case to ICE. Ulin Dec., Ex. I, Aug. 28, 2013 DACA SOP, Ch. 14; Ex. H at 61-\n21\n63, USCIS Memo. “All EPS cases must be referred to ICE” for “an opportunity to\ndecide if, when, and how to issue an NTA . . . . USCIS will not issue an NTA in\n22\nthese cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA. . . . This referral process is utilized in\norder to give ICE the opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action\n23\nbefore USCIS adjudicates the case.” Id., Ex. H at 61-63, USCIS Memo. ICE’s\nissuance of an NTA after an EPS referral is meant to allow USCIS to “proceed\n24\nwith adjudication, . . . taking into account the basis for the NTA.” Id. If ICE\nissues an NTA based on an EPS concern, USCIS will terminate DACA status\n25\n“automatically,” without an NOIT or opportunity to respond. Neither the DACA\nSOP nor the USCIS Memo authorizes termination without notice when CBP issues\n26\nan NTA or in the absence of an EPS determination by ICE. In such instances, an\nNOIT and 33 days to respond are required.\n27\n28\n8\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.961   Page 15 of 37\n(5) “If national security concerns arise after removal has been deferred under\n1 DACA, the case should go through the [Controlled Application Review and\nResolution Program], through established CARRP protocols.”\n2\n(6) “If after consulting with ICE, USCIS determines that exercising prosecutorial\n3 discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with\n[DHS’s] enforcement priorities, and ICE does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer\n4 should refer the case to HQSCOPS, through the normal chain of command, to\ndetermine whether or not a[n] NOIT is appropriate.” If USCIS issues an NOIT and\n5 “it is determined that the case warrants final termination, the officer will issue\nDACA 603 – Termination Notice [Enforcement Priority; Not Automatically\n6 Terminated] from the Appendix I.”\n7 E. BENEFITS CONFERRED BY DACA STATUS\n8 DACA status confers numerous benefits on a recipient. Chief among them\n9 is “authoriz[ation] by DHS to be present in the United States, and [] therefore\n10 considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the period deferred action is in\n11 effect.” Ulin Dec., Ex. B, DACA FAQ, Q1; see Arizona Dream Act Coalition v.\n12 Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1058-59 (9th Cir. 2014); Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n13 Because DACA recipients are “lawfully present,” DHS and USCIS have directed\n14 ICE and CBP “to prevent qualifying individuals from being apprehended, placed\n15 into removal proceedings, or removed.” Ulin Dec., Ex. B, DACA FAQ, Q9.\n16 Another “core benefit” (Dkt. 12 at 12) of DACA status is the EAD,\n17 conferring the right to lawful employment “for the period of deferred action.” Ulin\n18 Dec., Ex. B, DACA FAQ, Q1; see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12, (c)(33). In addition to the\n19 “ability to financially provide for himself and his family” (Dkt. 12 at 12), the EAD\n20 provides a DACA recipient a Social Security Number, which opens the door to and\n21 encourages investment in ancillary benefits typically unavailable or difficult to\n22 obtain for undocumented immigrants, including the ability to open bank accounts,\n23 obtain credit cards, start businesses, purchase homes and cars, and obtain state\n24 financial aid for higher education. In short, “lawful presence removes the\n25 categorical bar” to employment, participation in crucial elements of social, civic,\n26 and economic life, and certain public benefits. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n27\n28\n9\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.962   Page 16 of 37\nF. MR. GONZALEZ’S DACA STATUS AND EMPLOYMENT\n1\nMr. Gonzalez was brought to the United States from Mexico sixteen years\n2\nago, as an eight-year-old. He has lived in San Diego ever since. Declaration of\n3\nAlberto Luciano Gonzalez Torres (“Gonzalez Dec.”) ¶ 1. After graduating on time\n4\nfrom Altus Charter High School in 2011, Mr. Gonzalez was unable to secure\n5\nlawful employment for nearly two years because he was unwilling to misrepresent\n6\nhis immigration status. Id. ¶ 2.\n7\nBut in early 2013, after extensive background and criminal record checks,\n8\nUSCIS granted him DACA status, an EAD, and a Social Security Number. Id. ¶¶\n9\n3-4; Ulin Dec., Ex. J (initial DACA approval notice). In late 2014, after more\n10\nbackground checks, USCIS granted renewal through December 22, 2017. Id. ¶ 4;\n11\nUlin Dec., Ex. K (DACA renewal approval notice).2\n12\nMr. Gonzalez quickly obtained lawful employment with Gate Gourmet after\n13\nbeing granted DACA status. Id. ¶ 5. Because of the nature of his work (preparing\n14\nfood and equipment for commercial aircraft), he had to pass additional screening,\n15\nincluding interviews, drug tests, security clearance protocols, and EAD\n16\nverification. Id. Mr. Gonzalez was a dutiful and trusted employee for nearly three\n17\nyears. Id. ¶¶ 5-6. He was saving up to buy his own car to more easily commute to\n18\nwork. Id. ¶ 7. When USCIS initially terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and\n19\nEAD, he voluntarily informed his employers, who told him they had to let him go,\n20\nbut asked that he reapply upon restoration of his EAD. Id. ¶ 8.\n21\nMr. Gonzalez’s employers have praised his “work ethic, dedication, and\n22\nconsistency.” One of them wrote to USCIS to “recommend that he continue to be\n23\nprovided the opportunity to be gainfully employed here” because he “would [be]\n24\nhighly recommended [] to any future employer.” Ulin Dec., Ex. L at 96 (NOIT\n25\nresponse).\n26\n27\n28 2 In 2015, USCIS further screened all DACA recipients for suspected gang\naffiliations and found no reason to alter Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status.\n10\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.963   Page 17 of 37\nG. MR. GONZALEZ’S ARREST AND RELEASE\n1\nOn May 6, 2016, an acquaintance known to Mr. Gonzalez only as “Adolfo”\n2\nasked him to come to his house and care for his dogs while Adolfo was out of\n3\ntown. Mr. Gonzalez agreed, having done so in the past without issue. Gonzalez\n4\nDec. ¶ 9. He arrived at the house sometime between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Id.\n5\n¶ 9. He was surprised to find two other people already at the house—a man Mr.\n6\nGonzalez recognized only as “Romeo” and a woman he did not recognize. Id. ¶ 9.\n7\nAfter tending to the dogs, Mr. Gonzalez considered leaving them in the care of\n8\nRomeo and the woman. But without a car, he was unable to leave until his sister\n9\narrived to take him to his early-evening-to-early-morning work shift. Id. ¶ 10.\n10\nAt roughly 4:00 p.m., law enforcement officers knocked on the front door.\n11\nId. ¶ 11. Mr. Gonzalez explained to the officers that it was not his home and that\n12\nhe could not let them in without a search warrant. Id. ¶ 11. The officers stopped\n13\ntrying to enter the house or speak to Mr. Gonzalez, though they continued to\n14\nsurround the house. Id. ¶ 11. About an hour later, a man Mr. Gonzalez did not\n15\nrecognize arrived, claiming to be the owner and asking Mr. Gonzalez to exit. Id. ¶\n16\n12. Mr. Gonzalez had to leave for work soon, and he came outside. Id. ¶ 13.\n17\nRelying on Defendants’ assurances—publicly and in his DACA approval\n18\nnotices—that DACA status barred his apprehension as long as he had not\n19\ncommitted any crime, Mr. Gonzalez informed the officers of his DACA status and\n20\nhis need to get to work. Id. ¶ 14. He showed them his EAD with C-33 DACA\n21\nclassification. Id. ¶ 14. Nevertheless, CBP told him he was going to be detained\n22\nbecause he was not in the country legally and his DACA status did not matter. Id.\n23\n¶ 15. An officer handcuffed him, while two others entered the house. Id. ¶¶ 16-17.\n24\nA few minutes later—without further questioning or explanation—the first officer\n25\nput him in a police car and took him away. Mr. Gonzalez did not see or hear that\n26\nofficer speak to or engage with anyone who went inside the house. Id. ¶ 17.\n27\n28\n11\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.964   Page 18 of 37\n1 Mr. Gonzalez spent the next two days in immigration detention—threatened\n2 with vague insinuations of wrongdoing. His repeated refrain was, “I don’t\n3 understand why I’m being detained.” Id. ¶ 18. Eventually, Mr. Gonzalez agreed\n4 to let officers review his cell phone contacts and communications. As they pored\n5 over Mr. Gonzalez’s innocuous contact list and text messages, he saw the\n6 disappointment in their faces. Id. ¶ 19. After the initial questioning, Mr. Gonzalez\n7 was twice transferred to other detention facilities, where Defendants simply\n8 ignored him for nearly a month. The questioning ceased entirely. Id. ¶¶ 21-22.\n9 After two days of threats, abuse, unsubstantiated accusations, and a coerced phone\n10 search, the officers clearly realized that Mr. Gonzalez was not of any interest.\n11 On June 1, 2016, Immigration Judge McSeveney ordered Mr. Gonzalez\n12 released on just $5,000 bond after determining that he was not a public safety\n13 concern. DHS waived appeal. Mr. Gonzalez was finally released on June 3, 2016.\n14 Id. ¶ 23; see Ulin Dec., Ex. M (bond and release order of Immigration Judge).\n15 In the course of this litigation, Defendants have subsequently alleged that\n16 CBP encountered twelve undocumented immigrants in the attic of the house, and\n17 that the next day, three of the twelve identified a person “resembling” Mr.\n18 Gonzalez in photo lineups. Tellingly, Defendants neither name the three witnesses\n19 who allegedly identified Mr. Gonzalez nor disclose the results of the photo lineups\n20 shown to the other nine individuals, who presumably did not identify him. Mr.\n21 Gonzalez has repeatedly and unambiguously disavowed any knowledge of or\n22 involvement in whatever wrongdoing might have occurred at the house—to CBP\n23 officers during his detention, to Immigration Judge McSeveney at his bond\n24 hearing, in a sworn declaration submitted to this Court, and in his response to\n25 USCIS’s NOIT. Judge McSeveney determined that Mr. Gonzalez was credible\n26 and did not present a public safety concern. And Defendants’ own conduct\n27 strongly suggests that they concluded long ago that he was not involved.\n28\n12\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.965   Page 19 of 37\n1 In nearly two years since his release, Mr. Gonzalez has never been charged\n2 with a crime or had another encounter with law enforcement. Throughout the\n3 course of this litigation, Defendants have made clear that Mr. Gonzalez has not\n4 been under investigation for any wrongdoing surrounding the events of May 6,\n5 2016 or otherwise since those two days of questioning immediately following his\n6 arrest. Indeed, Defendants recently explained on December 8, 2017 that they “do\n7 not take issue with [Mr. Gonzalez’s] ability to meet the DACA guidelines going\n8 forward” (Dkt. 23-2 at 8), establishing their admission of the obvious: Mr.\n9 Gonzalez has no disqualifying criminal offenses and does not pose a threat to\n10 national security or public safety.\n11 H. USCIS’S UNLAWFUL “AUTOMATIC” TERMINATION OF\nMR. GONZALEZ’S DACA STATUS AND EAD\n12\nOn May 7, 2016—just one day after Mr. Gonzalez was arrested—CBP\n13\nissued him an NTA. Its sole charge was unlawful presence in the United States\n14\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Ulin Dec., Ex. N (NTA). USCIS sent him a\n15\n“Notice of Action” dated May 23, 2016, purporting to automatically terminate his\n16\nDACA status and EAD. Ulin Dec., Ex. O (“Notice of Action”). On September 29,\n17\n2017, this Court vacated and preliminarily enjoined that termination as violating\n18\nthe DACA SOP and the APA. The Court ordered Defendants to “fully comply\n19\nwith the DACA SOP should Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA\n20\nstatus” and to accept his DACA renewal application. Dkt. 12 at 13. Mr. Gonzalez\n21\ntimely submitted a renewal application upon his DACA status reinstatement.\n22\nI. THE NOIT PROCESS\n23\nSix weeks after the Court entered its current Preliminary Injunction—and a\n24\nyear and a half after Defendants ceased suspecting or investigating Mr. Gonzalez\n25\nof criminality—on November 13, 2017, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez an NOIT. Its\n26\nsole stated reasoning is:\n27\nSince DHS has determined that you are an enforcement\n28 priority and ICE has informed USCIS that it is actively\npursuing your removal, USCIS will not contemporaneously\n13\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.966   Page 20 of 37\nconclude that removal action should continue to be deferred\n1 in your case.\n2 Ulin Dec., Ex. P (“NOIT”).\n3 Of the six potential bases for DACA termination defined in the DACA SOP,\n4 see supra at 8-9, the NOIT cites only number 6 (“exercising prosecutorial\n5 discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with the\n6 Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement priorities”). The NOIT does not\n7 identify the asserted enforcement priorities or any source for them. Nor does it cite\n8 a single fact (other than ICE’s litigation of removal proceedings for unlawful\n9 presence) on which DHS or USCIS would rely in determining whether Mr.\n10 Gonzalez indeed fits DHS’s asserted enforcement priorities.3\n11 Mr. Gonzalez timely responded to the NOIT. The response explains that\n12 Mr. Gonzalez continues to meet all of the objectively verifiable DACA criteria that\n13 have always informed Defendants’ DACA status determinations, including the\n14 lack of any disqualifying criminal offenses and Judge McSeveney’s determination\n15 that he was credible and did not pose a threat to public safety. Ulin Dec., Ex. L at\n16 88, 92 (NOIT response). It goes on to explain Defendants’ apparent agreement\n17 with the Immigration Judge’s public safety determination. Id. at 93.\n18 The response reminds Defendants that the litigation of removal proceedings\n19 for unlawful presence has never been a bar to DACA status under the DACA\n20 Memo, DACA SOP, and DACA FAQ, and that the litigation of those proceedings\n21 would not “provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA.” Id. at 89-91 (citing\n22 Inland Empire—Immigrant Youth Collective v. Duke, 2017 WL 5800061, at *6-7\n23 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (“IEIYC”); Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42 (2011)).\n24 Forced to address the NOIT’s assertion that he is now an “enforcement\n25 priority” even though it “does not explain why” (id. at 93), Mr. Gonzalez’s\n26\n27 3 On November 16, 2017, the Immigration Judge terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s removal\nproceedings without prejudice. On December 8, 2017, ICE issued Mr. Gonzalez\n28 another NTA. It again alleges nothing but unlawful presence under 8 U.S.C. §\n1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Ulin Dec., Ex. Q (NTA).\n14\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.967   Page 21 of 37\n1 response recounts the facts surrounding his arrest and release by CBP in May\n2 2016, his sworn denials of wrongdoing, and the determinations by Judge\n3 McSeveney and DHS that he does not pose a threat to public safety. He explains:\n4  He has never been charged with or convicted of any crime in any forum, and\ntherefore does not have a DACA disqualifying (or any other) criminal offense.\n5\n DHS has been fully aware of his encounter with CBP for more than a year and a\n6 half, and has allowed him to continue living freely in San Diego without ever\ninvestigating him further.\n7\n The Kelly Memo’s declaration that all persons who are not legally present in\n8 the United States or have been suspected of some wrongdoing are enforcement\npriorities expressly does not apply to DACA recipients—and therefore cannot\n9 form the basis of an assertion that Mr. Gonzalez is an enforcement priority\nbecause ICE initiated removal proceedings against him on the sole charge of\n10 unlawful presence.\n11  “[T]o the extent that the NOIT—which does not even mention any criminal\nallegations—might be read to import them, Mr. Gonzalez is being deprived of\n12 his due process rights, where the termination of DACA and employment\nauthorization (and the liberty and property interests associated with the right to\n13 remain in the United States and work lawfully) hinges on un-stated and\nuncharged criminal suspicions informally adjudicated without the\n14 Constitutional and statutory protections of the criminal justice system.” Id. at\n94.\n15\nUSCIS issued its purported termination notice within three days of receiving\n16\nMr. Gonzalez’s response—on December 21, 2017, the day before his DACA status\n17\nwas set to expire. See Ulin Dec., Ex. R, “Termination Notice.” The Termination\n18\nNotice belatedly does what the NOIT neglected to do: it explains what facts USCIS\n19\ndeems relevant to its decision on Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status. It does not,\n20\nhowever, explain why—in the absence of any disqualifying criminal offenses or\n21\nany statement that Mr. Gonzalez poses a threat to public safety—his continued\n22\nDACA status is “not consistent with the DHS’s enforcement priorities.”\n23\nThe Termination Notice relies on ICE’s litigation of removal proceedings in\n24\nImmigration Court. And it reflects a USCIS officer’s determination—following an\n25\ninformal consideration—that Mr. Gonzalez’s sworn statements disavowing\n26\ncriminality are “not credible.” Id., Ex. R at 196. That determination is based on\n27\nthree factors: (1) Mr. Gonzalez’s presence at the house; (2) that the arrest record\n28\n15\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.968   Page 22 of 37\n1 issued the day after the incident describes Mr. Gonzalez as “nervous” when a slew\n2 of federal officers descended on him while he was minding his own business; and\n3 (3) “that three individuals did identify you in connection with their smuggling.”\n4 Id. Of course, it ignores that the same arrest record: (1) explains that whoever\n5 allegedly smuggled those individuals into the house did so several hours before\n6 Mr. Gonzalez arrived; (2) identifies two other male individuals at the house when\n7 the officers arrived; and (3) sheds no light on the circumstances of the three (out of\n8 twelve) purported identifications, which have never been examined by Mr.\n9 Gonzalez or assessed by a neutral arbiter. See Ulin Dec., Ex. S (DHS Form I-213).\n10 The Termination Notice acknowledges that Mr. Gonzalez has “not been\n11 charged criminally or in immigration court for any crime related to the events of\n12 May 6, 2016.” And USCIS does not dispute that he “meet[s] all other DACA\n13 criteria.” Ulin Dec., Ex. R at 196, Termination Notice. Indeed, nowhere does\n14 USCIS claim that Mr. Gonzalez poses a threat to national security or public safety.\n15 The Termination Notice simply asserts USCIS’s unfettered “ultimate discretion to\n16 determine whether deferred action is appropriate in any given case.” Id.4\n17 III. ARGUMENT\nA. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD\n18\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he is\n19\nlikely to succeed on the merits, (2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the\n20\nabsence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4)\n21\nan injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20\n22\n(2008). Under the Ninth Circuit’s sliding scale approach, “[s]erious questions\n23\ngoing to the merits and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff\n24\ncan support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as” the irreparable injury\n25\nand public interest elements are satisfied. Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n26\n27 4 On December 28, 2017, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a purported denial of his\nrenewal application as well. Even though the Termination Notice has yet to go into\n28 effect, the denial notice relies solely on the unlawful termination. See Ulin Dec., Ex.\nT (purported renewal denial notice).\n16\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.969   Page 23 of 37\n1 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). In other words, “[i]f the balance of harm tips\n2 decidedly toward [Mr. Gonzalez], then [he] need not show as robust a likelihood of\n3 success on the merits as when the balance tips less decidedly.” Rep. of the\n4 Philippines v. Marcos, 862 F.2d 1355, 1362 (9th Cir. 1988); see Arcamuzi v.\n5 Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 937 (9th Cir. 1987) (“fair chance of\n6 success on the merits” and a “significant threat of irreparable injury”).\n7 B. MR. GONZALEZ IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON HIS APA\nAND CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS—OR AT LEAST HAS\n8 RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LAWFULNESS\nOF HIS DACA TERMINATION\n9\n1. None of the INA’s Jurisdictional Bars Apply\n10\nThis Court has already correctly held that neither 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) nor 8\n11\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) strips the Court of jurisdiction to decide the claims at issue\n12\nhere. Section 1252(g) “does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to entertain\n13\nPlaintiff’s claim that the termination of his DACA status did not comply with the\n14\nnon-discretionary DACA SOP” because the Court (1) may consider “a purely legal\n15\nconclusion that does not challenge the Attorney General’s discretionary authority,\n16\neven if the answer . . . forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later\n17\nwill exercise discretionary authority,” and (2) “retain[s] jurisdiction to review\n18\nconstitutional claims, even when those claims address [agency] discretion.” Dkt.\n19\n12 at 8 (citations omitted). And Section 1252(b)(9) does not apply to Mr.\n20\nGonzalez’s “procedural challenge to termination of his DACA status, an issue\n21\nindependent from any removal proceedings.” Dkt. 12 at 9.\n22\nDefendants may argue that Mr. Gonzalez is now challenging the outcome of\n23\nhis DACA termination proceedings. He is not. Mr. Gonzalez is again challenging\n24\nDefendants’ failure to abide by their own non-discretionary guidelines. He is not\n25\nasking the Court to define Defendants’ enforcement priorities, but merely to\n26\nrequire Defendants to abide by their own existing definitions, as delineated in the\n27\nDACA Memo, DACA SOP, Kelly Memo, and DHS statements. He also brings\n28\nconstitutional claims over which the Court “retains jurisdiction.”\n17\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.970   Page 24 of 37\n2. Mr. Gonzalez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits of His APA\n1 Claims\n2 Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action,\nfindings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n3\nor otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). An agency’s\n4\nfailure to follow its own internal policies is a sufficient ground to set aside its\n5\naction. U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Alcaraz v.\n6\nINS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases requiring agencies to\n7\n“abide by … internal policies,” including in immigration context). Agency action\n8\nmust demonstrate “reasoned decision-making.” Judulang, 565 U.S. at 52-53.\n9\na. Defendants Ignored Their Own DACA Termination\nPolicy\n10\nFederal agencies must comply with their own guidelines, policies, and\n11\nprocedures “[w]here the rights of individuals are affected.” Morton v. Ruiz, 415\n12\nU.S. 199, 235 (1974). An agency is “bound by its regulations so long as they\n13\nremain operative,”—i.e., until the agency properly “repeal[s] them and\n14\nsubstitute[s] new rules in their place.” Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021,\n15\n1025 (9th Cir. 1985) (discussing INS’s internal deferred action instructions).\n16\nUnexplained departure from established practice is arbitrary and capricious and\n17\nmust be set aside. FCC v. Fox TV Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).\n18\nChapter 14 of the DACA SOP enumerates six bases for DACA termination.\n19\nIf a DACA termination does not comport with one of those six bases, the\n20\ntermination does not comply with the SOP and is therefore arbitrary action that\n21\nviolates the APA and must be set aside.5\n22\nDefendants do not assert any of the SOP’s first five bases for termination—\n23\nerror; fraud; EPS concerns; “disqualifying criminal offenses” or “public safety\n24\nconcerns”; or “national security concerns—in Mr. Gonzalez’s NOIT or\n25\n26 5 As an initial matter, USCIS’s NOIT was deficient under the SOP because it did not\nprovide the “grounds” upon which USCIS intended to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n27 DACA status. Without conveying the guidance upon which the determination would\nbe made or the facts that USCIS deemed relevant, Mr. Gonzalez was forced to guess\n28 how he might “overcome” the “adverse grounds” that the SOP contemplates an NOIT\nwill contain. Ulin Dec., Ex. I at 80, Aug. 28, 2013 DACA SOP.\n18\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.971   Page 25 of 37\n1 Termination Notice. See supra at 13-16. The only asserted basis for his\n2 termination is the sixth—that deferred action is “not consistent with DHS’s\n3 enforcement priorities.” In making that determination, Defendants departed from\n4 their own binding policies and thus violated the APA.\n5 DHS has defined a two-tiered system of enforcement priorities via the Kelly\n6 Memo, under which the DACA program remains operative:\n7 (1) DACA recipients continue to be governed by the DACA Memo and\n8 DACA SOP. If a DACA recipient meets the DACA Memo’s objectively verifiable\n9 criteria, he or she remains, by definition, a “low priority case.” In other words, that\n10 individual is not an enforcement priority. A reversal of that non-priority status\n11 requires a finding that:\n12  DACA status was conferred in error; or\n13  the individual committed fraud in seeking DACA status; or\n14  the individual has since been convicted or adjudicated guilty of a disqualifying\n15 criminal offense (felony, significant misdemeanor, or multiple misdemeanors)\n16 or presents “significant public safety concerns”6; or\n17  the individual presents an EPS concern; or\n18  the individual presents a national security concern.\n19 (2) On the other hand, an individual without DACA status may be an\n20 enforcement priority “regardless of the basis for removability” if he has merely\n21 “been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved” or is\n22 suspected of having “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal\n23 offense.” Ulin Dec., Ex. D at 31, Kelly Memo.\n24 Mr. Gonzalez’s Termination Notice does not allege error or fraud, that he\n25 has a disqualifying criminal conviction or adverse adjudication, that he presents an\n26 EPS or national security concern, or that he presents a public safety concern.\n27 Indeed, the word “safety” does not appear in either the NOIT or the Termination\n28\n6 See Ulin Dec., Ex. U at 209, Apr. 4, 2013 DACA SOP.\n19\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.972   Page 26 of 37\n1 Notice; and the word “charge” appears only in acknowledging the lack of any.\n2 Rather, Defendants purport to label Mr. Gonzalez an enforcement priority on\n3 grounds applicable only to non-DACA recipients—i.e., a USCIS officer’s\n4 determination through informal review of an NOIT and response that Mr.\n5 Gonzalez’s sworn statements disavowing criminality are “not credible” and the\n6 suspicion of that officer and one or more unidentified individuals at ICE that Mr.\n7 Gonzalez committed criminal acts, which Defendants notably have neglected even\n8 to investigate for nearly two years. This is a failure to follow unambiguous\n9 internal rules. Tellingly, the only other basis for the assertion that Mr. Gonzalez is\n10 an “enforcement priority” is ICE’s issuance of an NTA against him for nothing\n11 more than unlawful presence. Of course, that is not “a reasoned basis for\n12 terminating DACA.” IEIYC, 2017 WL 5800061, at *6-7.\n13 In short, Defendants have applied the non-DACA definition of “enforcement\n14 priority” to a DACA recipient, in violation of their own policies in the Kelly Memo\n15 and DACA SOP. See Coyotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1344 n.7 (“Defendants’ attempt\n16 to rely on the Kelly Memo to justify their decisions reinforces the arbitrariness of\n17 their actions against Plaintiff, when the Kelly Memo expressly exempts the DACA\n18 program from its scope.”); compare Ulin Dec., Ex. U at 208, Apr. 4, 2013 DACA\n19 SOP (“When a DACA requestor’s RAP sheet indicates an arrest, it is necessary to\n20 determine whether the DACA requestor has been convicted of a crime.”)\n21 (emphases added), with Ulin Dec., Ex. D at 31, Kelly Memo (prioritizing non-\n22 DACA recipients “charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved”\n23 or suspected of “committ[ing] acts which constitute a chargeable criminal\n24 offense”) (emphases added).7\n25\n7 Defendants may argue that defining “enforcement priorities” for DACA recipients\n26 by reference to the other bases for termination renders the enforcement priority\nsection of Chapter 14 redundant. Not so. That section simply reflects the well-\n27 settled truth that an agency “may repeal [its policies] and substitute new rules in their\nplace.” Romeiro de Silva, 773 F.2d at 1025. But Defendants are “bound by” the\n28 existing rules “so long as they remain operative.” Id.

Defendants’ Action Is Arbitrary and Capricious\n1\nAs Defendants repeatedly remind the Court, DACA status decisions are an\n2\nexercise of discretion. An agency must exercise discretion through “reasoned\n3\ndecision-making.” Judulang, 565 U.S. at 52-53. A reviewing court must\n4\n“examin[e] the reasons for agency decisions—or, as the case may be, the absence\n5\nof such reasons.” Id. at 53. The exercise of discretion exercised pursuant to\n6\npromulgated rules cannot be a standardless foray. On the contrary, the agency\n7\nmust “cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner.”\n8\nNat’l Parks Conserv. Assoc. v. EPA, 788 F.3d 1134, 1142 (9th Cir. 2015).\n9\nPursuant to those rules, immigration decisions must be based on “relevant factors.”\n10\nJudulang, 565 U.S. at 55. “An agency may not . . . depart from a prior policy sub\n11\nsilentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.” FCC, 556 U.S. at\n12\n515. And the agency must abide by its stated rationale, not post hoc\n13\nrationalizations. Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. U.S., 371 U.S. 156 (1962).\n14\nDefendants may disavow having applied the Kelly Memo’s new\n15\nenforcement priorities, and insist that their attempt to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n16\nDACA status is based on and comports with the DACA Memo and SOP. Their\n17\naction remains arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion all the same. In a\n18\nsingle paragraph of the Termination Notice, USCIS (1) acknowledges that Mr.\n19\nGonzalez has “not been charged criminally or in immigration court for any crime\n20\nrelated to the events of May 6, 2016,” (2) does not dispute that Mr. Gonzalez\n21\n“meet[s] all other DACA criteria” (which of course includes the lack of any public\n22\n23\ndefine the prioritization of certain DACA recipients in the Kelly Memo or other\n24 guidance. Indeed, they made several other changes to the DACA program, including\nthe elimination of advance parole and the end of accepting applications. But the\n25 Kelly Memo and DHS’s subsequent explanations delineate the agency’s tiered\npriorities and make clear that the DACA guidelines remain operative without any\n26 change in DHS’s stated position in the DACA Memo that DACA recipients are “low\npriority case[s]” and do not “meet [DHS’s] enforcement priorities.” See supra at 6\n27 (“We rely on guidance that was put in place in 2012 when the DACA program was\ninitiated. That’s available on USCIS’s website and will tell you what the priorities\n28 are for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and what they are for the Department\nat large. Those priorities have not changed.”).\n21\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.974   Page 28 of 37\n1 safety concerns), and (3) tells him that those considerations have no bearing on\n2 whether he is an enforcement priority. Ulin Dec., Ex. R at 196, Termination\n3 Notice. USCIS’s position amounts to nothing less than assertion of the same\n4 unfettered discretion this Court already “categorically reject[ed].” Dkt. 12 at 10.\n5 In Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979), the Ninth Circuit explained\n6 that an internal deferred action policy with “express criteria” and “periodic review\n7 of non-priority status” “clearly and directly affects substantive rights,” including\n8 “the ability of an individual subject to its provisions to continue residence in the\n9 United States.” Id. at 807-08. Accordingly, “non-priority status” cannot be\n10 terminated “at the convenience of the [agency].” Rather, the status depends on the\n11 recipient’s continued eligibility under the “relevant” guidelines. Id.; see\n12 McDonald v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 684, 686-87 (9th Cir. 2005) (“Current INS policy\n13 is reflected in an INS memo” that “lists five factors for the agent to weigh,” and\n14 “[h]ad these instructions been followed in [this] case, it is hard to image that [the\n15 plaintiff] would today be facing removal.”).\n16 Because Defendants have acknowledged that Mr. Gonzalez has never been\n17 convicted of a crime and does not pose a threat to public safety, their decision to\n18 rescind his DACA because he is somehow an “enforcement priority” has no basis\n19 in “reasoned decision-making,” or factors that are relevant to DACA status\n20 decisions. It is based on a USCIS officer’s failure to comply with the DACA\n21 Memo and the termination provisions of the DACA SOP. See Movsisian v.\n22 Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir. 2005) (agency abuses its discretion when it\n23 fails to provide a “reasoned explanation for its actions”); NRDC, Inc. v. EPA, 966\n24 F.2d 1292, 1305 (9th Cir. 1992) (disparate treatment and departure from “normal .\n25 . . process based on . . . unsubstantiated assumption[s]” is “arbitrary and\n26 capricious”); U.S. v. One 1985 Mercedes, 917 F.2d 415, 422 (9th Cir. 1990)\n27 (“Where the government does not act in a consistent and predictable manner, it\n28 runs the risk of violating the [APA] and of having its action invalidated.”).\n22\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.975   Page 29 of 37\n1 Moreover, because the allegations in Mr. Gonzalez’s arrest record and\n2 Termination Notice have never been tested in a competent forum, the Termination\n3 Notice is clearly based on incomplete information, and for that additional reason\n4 should be set aside. See Bertelsen v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 1 F. Supp. 3d 1060\n5 (E.D. Cal. 2014) (arbitrary and capricious to revoke—based on incomplete\n6 information—eligibility for benefits that was based on previous careful\n7 examinations); Petition of Guerrero-Morales, 512 F. Supp. 1328, 1329-30 (D.\n8 Minn. 1981) (in reviewing denial of deferred action, court must look not only to\n9 evidence supporting administrative finding, but also take into account anything in\n10 the record that fairly detracts from its weight).\n11 The only judicial determination of Mr. Gonzalez’s credibility resulted in his\n12 immediate release from detention and a determination that he poses no threat to\n13 public safety. Defendants did not object to or appeal that determination, and have\n14 done nothing to impede Mr. Gonzalez’s peaceful return to the San Diego\n15 community for nearly two years. He has not even been investigated again after\n16 two days of questioning in May 2016. Consistent with those actions, Defendants\n17 continue to acknowledge that he does not pose any safety threat. They are simply\n18 making the bare assertion that he is an “enforcement priority” in disregard for the\n19 DACA Memo and DACA SOP. By purporting to unmoor enforcement priority\n20 determinations from the carefully delineated criteria of the DACA Memo and SOP,\n21 Defendants seek to impose a “method for disfavoring deportable aliens . . . that\n22 neither focuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the country.” That\n23 is arbitrary and capricious. Judulang, 565 U.S. at 55.\n24 3. Mr. Gonzalez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits of His Due\nProcess Claims\n25\nIf the Court believes that the DACA SOP countenances Defendants’ actions,\n26\nit should nevertheless set aside Mr. Gonzalez’s NOIT and Termination Notice for\n27\nfailure to comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which\n28\n23\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.976   Page 30 of 37\n1 applies to all ‘persons’ within the United States, including aliens, whether their\n2 presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” U.S. v. Peralta-\n3 Sanchez, 847 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir. 2017); see Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.\n4 678, 693 (2001). The Constitution “imposes constraints on governmental\n5 decisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests.” Mathews\n6 v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). DACA status confers both liberty and\n7 property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and any\n8 deprivation of those interests must comport with the “essence of due process”:\n9 adequate notice and “the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a\n10 meaningful manner.” Id. at 333, 348-49 (emphases added).\n11 a. DACA Status Confers Liberty and Property Interests\n12 Liberty and property rights are a function of “the substance of the interest\n13 recognized, not the name given that interest by the state.” Newman v.\n14 Sathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d 786, 797 (9th Cir. 2002). Defendants have conferred\n15 meaningful legal rights on DACA beneficiaries—including lawful presence,\n16 employment authorization, and access to certain federal benefits. In so doing, they\n17 simultaneously conferred a constitutional right not to be deprived of those interests\n18 without due process. See Regents v. DHS, 2018 WL 339144, at *25 (N.D. Cal.\n19 Jan. 9, 2018) (“Defendants’ attempt to portray DACA as a program that did not\n20 generate reliance interests is unconvincing [because] DACA recipients . . .\n21 developed expectations based on the possibility that [they] could renew their\n22 deferred action and work authorizations for additional two-year periods.”).\n23 The “Constitution itself” confers the “narrow liberty interest” of Defendants’\n24 “strict compliance” with the terms of the DACA program. Trinidad y Garcia v.\n25 Thomas, 683 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2012). More broadly, the most obvious\n26 liberty interest conferred by DACA status is the fact that DHS considers a DACA\n27 recipient—who, by definition, has lived in the United States since at least 2007—\n28 “lawfully present.” As the Ninth Circuit has explained, even a person who “has\n24\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.977   Page 31 of 37\n1 run some fifty yards into the United States” and is immediately apprehended\n2 “confronts the loss of a significant liberty interest.” U.S. v. Raya-Vaca, 771 F.3d\n3 1195, 1203 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2014) (emphasis added). Liberty also encompasses the\n4 ability to work, raise a family, and “form the other enduring attachments of life.”\n5 Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972). That is what the DACA program\n6 conferred when it encouraged undocumented “Dreamers” like Mr. Gonzalez to\n7 come forward and weave themselves into the country’s social fabric by seeking\n8 employment, starting businesses, and buying homes and cars on the understanding\n9 that as long as they kept their word to abide by the law, Defendants would deem\n10 them lawfully present.\n11 Property interests encompass more than tangible property and include any\n12 claim of entitlement that stems from government-created “rules or understandings\n13 that secure certain benefits.” Nozzi v. Housing Auth. of LA, 806 F.3d 1178, 1190-\n14 91 (9th Cir. 2015). Mr. Gonzalez’s employment authorization is precisely that.\n15 From 2011 to 2013, he could not find work because of his immigration status.\n16 Defendants remedied that in 2013 by granting him an EAD and Social Security\n17 Number, both of which they renewed in 2014. Once Defendants have conferred\n18 such a crucial benefit, they are compelled to provide a fair and adequate process\n19 before taking it away. See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971) (because a\n20 driver’s license may become essential to the pursuit of one’s livelihood, it cannot\n21 be revoked without due process); Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482 (parole revocation\n22 requires due process because of the implicit promise that it will not be stripped\n23 absent a failure to abide by its conditions); Singh v. Bardini, 2010 WL 308807, at\n24 *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) (“Even if there is no constitutional right to be granted\n25 asylum, . . . once granted, asylum status can[not] be taken away without any due\n26 process protections.” ) (citation omitted).\n27 In short, DACA status creates more than a unilateral expectation of lawful\n28 presence and employment authorization—it constitutes Defendants’ “pledge” not\n25\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.978   Page 32 of 37\n1 to deprive recipients of those interests without due process. Arizona Dream Act\n2 Coalition, 757 F.3d at 1066. Extending lawful presence to DACA recipients thus\n3 “create[s] a constitutionally protected liberty interest,” Olim v. Wakinekona, 461\n4 U.S. 238, 249 (1983), and the EAD creates an equally protected property interest.\n5 b. Defendants Have Violated Procedural Due Process\n6 The three-part Eldridge test for Procedural Due Process governs the\n7 constitutionality of Defendants’ deprivation of Mr. Gonzalez’s liberty and property\n8 interests. The Court must balance (1) the nature of Mr. Gonzalez’s interests and\n9 the degree of potential deprivation, (2) the fairness and reliability of existing\n10 procedures and the value of additional procedural safeguards, and (3) the public\n11 interest. 424 U.S. at 335. By purporting to place the determination of whether Mr.\n12 Gonzalez committed a crime nearly two years ago in the hands of a USCIS officer\n13 via an informal procedure without any hearing, opportunity to confront evidence,\n14 or cross-examine witnesses, Defendants have not provided a sufficiently fair and\n15 reliable procedure. See McDonald, 400 F.3d at 690 (“[I]n severity [deportation]\n16 surpasses all but the most Draconian criminal penalties. We therefore cannot deem\n17 wholly irrelevant the long unbroken tradition of the criminal law that harsh\n18 sanctions should not be imposed where moral culpability is lacking.”).\n19 First, Mr. Gonzalez’s interests could hardly be more significant. DACA\n20 termination threatens to completely deprive him, inter alia, of his basic ability to\n21 remain in the only country he has ever called home, where he was raised; to avoid\n22 removal to an unfamiliar country where he has not lived or even visited since he\n23 was a small child; and to earn a living. See Dkt. 12 at 12 (“The [C]ourt concludes\n24 that Plaintiff will suffer significant irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction\n25 by losing his DACA status.”).\n26 Second, “freedom from arbitrary adjudicative procedures is a substantive\n27 element of one’s liberty, and due-process safeguards must be analyzed\n28 accordingly.” Castillo v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 959 F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1262 (C.D.\n26\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.979   Page 33 of 37\n1 Cal. 2013). In the absence of any criminal charge or adjudication, or a stated\n2 public safety concern, it is anything but fair or reliable to allow a USCIS officer to\n3 determine Mr. Gonzalez’s credibility or his involvement in criminal conduct via an\n4 informal paper process nearly two years after all investigation ceased, especially\n5 where Mr. Gonzalez’s ability to defer adverse immigration action hangs in the\n6 balance. As an initial matter, Mr. Gonzalez’s NOIT provided the sort of “bare\n7 notice” that is “plainly” insufficient to satisfy due process. Gete v. INS, 121 F.3d\n8 1285, 1297 (9th Cir. 1997). It simply asserted, without citing to a single fact or\n9 source of guidance, that Mr. Gonzalez is an enforcement priority undeserving of\n10 continued DACA status. This alone suffices to illustrate the inadequacy of the\n11 process used. Id.\n12 More troublingly, the Termination Notice deems Mr. Gonzalez a criminal\n13 and imposes a serious consequence—the loss of DACA status—despite his\n14 repeated and sworn declarations to the contrary. It belatedly identifies the facts\n15 that USCIS considers relevant, but offers no opportunity to rebut them. The\n16 Supreme Court has explained that in “almost every setting where important\n17 decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an opportunity to confront\n18 and cross-examine adverse witnesses.” Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 269\n19 (1970). Mr. Gonzalez is effectively being labeled a criminal—the paradigm case\n20 for the right to confront adverse evidence. In these circumstances, the value of\n21 additional safeguards is paramount. See Hicks v. Colvin, 2016 WL 7436050, at *3\n22 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 21, 2016) (hearing devoid of opportunity to rebut government’s\n23 factual assertions is not meaningful and violates due process) (citing Armstrong v.\n24 Manzo, 380 U.S. 545 (1965)).8 However, Defendants have never even identified\n25 the witnesses against Mr. Gonzalez, let alone afforded him an opportunity to\n26\n8 Because an informal determination of criminality with serious consequences is\n27 anathema to our “concept of ordered liberty,” and because removal from the country\nin the absence of any culpability would visit such grievous harm, Defendants’ actions\n28 “shock the conscience” and also amount to a violation of Mr. Gonzalez’s substantive\ndue process rights. Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 (1998).\n27\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.980   Page 34 of 37\n1 confront them, to learn what happened to other people arrested at the house or to\n2 “Adolfo,” or to test the circumstances or reliability of the photo lineups Defendants\n3 deem so important, or to examine either the three individuals who allegedly\n4 identified him in those photo lineups or the nine individuals who did not.\n5 Third, Defendants have acknowledged the value of DACA recipients to this\n6 country, and have established procedures to protect them. The public interest is\n7 not served by arbitrarily stripping Mr. Gonzalez of his EAD, leaving him\n8 unemployed and financially vulnerable. “Complying with [their] constitutional\n9 obligations . . . would not be unduly burdensome.” Gete, 121 F.3d at 1298.\n10 Defendants already have an avenue for administrative review of the credibility of\n11 any criminal suspicions against Mr. Gonzalez that does not amount to a full-blown\n12 criminal trial, but nevertheless puts the decision in the hands of a competent\n13 neutral arbiter whose expertise is actually suited to such determinations and allows\n14 Mr. Gonzalez to confront witnesses and test the evidence against him. Defendants\n15 can issue an NTA for something more than mere unlawful presence and adjudicate\n16 the question of whether Mr. Gonzalez was involved in the alleged criminal activity\n17 that forms the basis for his DACA termination in Immigration Court.\n18 C. MR. GONZALEZ IS SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM\n19 Defendants’ termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status is causing him at\n20 least three forms of immediate and irreparable harm. First, he is being deprived of\n21 the Government’s recognition of his lawful presence in the only country he has\n22 ever called home, Arizona Dream Act Coalition, 757 F.3d at 1058-59, without due\n23 process. See Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“It is well-\n24 established that the deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes\n25 irreparable injury.”).\n26 Second, he is being stripped of the right to lawful employment, a core\n27 benefit of DACA status, leaving him less able to provide for himself and his\n28 family. These lost opportunities are the essence of irreparable harm. See\n28\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.981   Page 35 of 37\n1 Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (Supreme Court has\n2 “frequently recognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of\n3 livelihood”); Enyart v. Nat’l Conf. of Bar Examiners, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1165\n4 (9th Cir. 2011). Mr. Gonzalez’s age and socioeconomic status only increase these\n5 harms. Arizona Dream Act Coalition, 757 F.3d at 1068 (DACA recipients’\n6 injuries heightened by “young age and fragile socioeconomic position”;\n7 “[s]etbacks early in their careers are likely to haunt [them] for the rest of their\n8 lives”). This is simply “productive time irretrievably lost.” Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Ct.,\n9 840 F.2d 701, 710 (9th Cir. 1988).\n10 Finally, these concerns are all the more pressing given Defendants’\n11 purported denial of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA renewal application on the sole stated\n12 basis of their unlawful purported Termination Notice.\nD. THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES FAVORS MR. GONZALEZ,\n13\nAND AN INJUNCTION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST\n14\nNeither the Government nor the public has an interest in depriving Mr.\n15\nGonzalez of the right to remain lawfully present in the only country he knows,\n16\nwork, and pay taxes. U.S. v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 27 (1960) (“[T]here is the\n17\nhighest public interest in the due observance of all the constitutional guarantees.”).\n18\nMr. Gonzalez has lived in the United States for sixteen years, maintained a clean\n19\ncriminal record, and given Defendants no reason to think he poses any threat to the\n20\npublic—as the Immigration Judge found he did not when releasing him on just\n21\n$5,000 bond in June 2016, and Defendants reaffirmed when they acknowledged\n22\nthat he satisfies DACA’s eligibility criteria during the course of this litigation and\n23\nin the purported Termination Notice.\n24\nMoreover, it is abundantly clear that Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status was\n25\nterminated in violation of Defendants’ own binding procedures. The Government\n26\nhas an interest in maintaining adherence to its procedures, and “cannot suffer harm\n27\nfrom an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” Rodriguez v. Robbins,\n28\n715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013).\n29\nMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINOPPOSITIONTOEXPARTEAPPLICATIONANDIN\nSUPPORTOFMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 39-1   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.982   Page 36 of 37\n1 By contrast, Mr. Gonzalez would suffer greatly from the denial of an\n2 injunction—by losing Defendants’ recognition of his lawful presence without the\n3 basic protections of due process, losing his ability to work “on the books,” and\n4 having his DACA renewal application summarily denied. Mr. Gonzalez has a\n5 demonstrated history of contributing to the San Diego community and following\n6 the law. The public’s interest lies in assuring that he and others who play by the\n7 rules are not deprived of their liberty and property interests without due process.\n8 See Coyotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1344 n.7 (“Defendants argue that their interest in\n9 enforcing immigration laws outweighs any harms alleged by Plaintiff. Defendants’\n10 interest in enforcing immigration laws does not justify them running roughshod\n11 over Plaintiff by ignoring their own required procedures prior to undertaking action\n12 to deny or terminate her DACA status.”).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n13\nFor all of these reasons, Defendants’ purported termination of Mr.\n14\nGonzalez’s DACA status should be enjoined and set aside. Defendants’ purported\n15\ndenial of his DACA renewal application should also be enjoined because by its\n16\nown terms it relies on nothing more than the unlawful termination.\n17\n18\nDated: January 12, 2018 Respectfully submitted,\n19\n/s/ John C.

DACA status has made him\n5 “lawfully present” with the right to work in the United States and offered the\n6 opportunity for renewal upon consideration of the DACA eligibility criteria.\n7 Crucial to that status and to the consideration for renewal is the fact that—in the 16\n8 years he has lived in the United States, since the age of 8—he has never been\n9 charged with (let alone convicted of) any crime, in any forum.\n10 In May 2016, officers of Defendant CBP arrested Mr. Gonzalez when they\n11 encountered him at the home of an acquaintance where CBP claims it later found\n12 several undocumented immigrants. Following the arrest, Defendant USCIS\n13 unlawfully automatically terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status. In September\n14 2017, this Court vacated and preliminarily enjoined that termination as violating\n15 the DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) and the Administrative\n16 Procedure Act (“APA”).\n17 USCIS subsequently issued Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Intent to Terminate\n18 (“NOIT”) his DACA status. Its sole rationale is that he is now an “enforcement\n19 priority” because Defendant ICE is litigating Immigration Court removal\n20 proceedings against him on the charge of presence in the United States without\n21 admission or parole—i.e., the ground for removal that DACA, by definition, exists\n22 to defer because DACA recipients are “low priority cases.” Mr. Gonzalez\n23 responded to the NOIT, again denying any knowledge of or involvement in any\n24 possible wrongdoing associated with the circumstances of his arrest.\n25 While the NOIT was pending USCIS’s review, Defendants acknowledged\n26 that they “do not take issue with” the fact that Mr. Gonzalez continues to meet all\n27 of the DACA eligibility criteria. That very recent admission is significant, as one\n28 of those criteria is that a DACA requestor does not “pose[] a threat to national\n1\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.898   Page 3 of 46\n1 security or public safety.” Defendants’ acknowledgment is therefore inconsistent\n2 with USCIS’s sudden labeling of Mr. Gonzalez as an “enforcement priority,” in\n3 clear contravention of Defendants’ publicly stated and unambiguous definitions of\n4 that term, which make clear that DACA recipients remain low priority cases in the\n5 absence of adjudicated disqualifying criminal offenses.\n6 On the other hand, Defendants’ acknowledgment that he is not a public\n7 safety concern is entirely consistent with (1) the fact that Mr. Gonzalez has never\n8 been charged with or convicted of any crime, in any forum; (2) CBP’s\n9 abandonment of any investigation of Mr. Gonzalez after two days of aggressive\n10 interrogation nearly two years ago; (3) an Immigration Judge’s June 2016\n11 determination that he is not a public safety concern and should be released on just\n12 $5,000 bond; and (4) DHS’s decision not to object to or appeal that determination\n13 or to investigate or take any action against Mr. Gonzalez in the 20 months since he\n14 was released from immigration detention, during which time he has resumed his\n15 law-biding and productive life in San Diego, the only home he knows.\n16 In other words, for over a year and a half, the government has explicitly and\n17 implicitly indicated that it does not believe Mr. Gonzalez was involved in any\n18 criminal activity related to the circumstances of his arrest or that he is a safety\n19 concern. Accordingly, he has never had the opportunity to confront any potentially\n20 incriminating evidence against him because he has never been charged with a\n21 crime, in Immigration Court or otherwise. Defendants’ decision to label a DACA\n22 recipient an enforcement priority in the absence of any “criminal offense” is\n23 therefore an unexplained departure from the DACA Standard Operating\n24 Procedures and Defendants’ publicly iterated enforcement priority standards,\n25 which they have repeatedly affirmed have not changed for DACA recipients and\n26 remain governed by the criteria set forth in DHS’s 2012 DACA Memo.\n27 The closest Mr. Gonzalez has come to an opportunity to be heard by a\n28 neutral arbiter was at his bond hearing, where the Immigration Judge found him\n2\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.899   Page 4 of 46\n1 credible and determined that he is not a threat to the public before releasing him on\n2 $5,000 bond. And he has since disavowed any wrongdoing in a sworn declaration\n3 submitted to this Court, and again in his responses to USCIS’s NOIT.\n4 Nevertheless, USCIS—acting as judge and jury—has determined through an\n5 informal review that his assertions of innocence are “not credible” and that the\n6 “record as a whole”—i.e., his mere presence at the house and unsubstantiated\n7 identifications of a person “resembling” him by three of the twelve immigrants\n8 allegedly present at the house (but not the other nine)—suffice to label him a\n9 criminal. On the basis of this violation of the most basic tenets of due process,\n10 USCIS has purported to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment\n11 authorization, and to deny his renewal application.\n12 As explained more fully below, Defendants have violated the DACA Memo\n13 and DACA SOP, deviated from their own mandatory policies and public\n14 pronouncements regarding enforcement priorities without any reason or\n15 explanation, and declared Mr. Gonzalez a criminal through an informal\n16 determination that contradicts their own behavior and statements. Defendants’\n17 actions violate the APA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The\n18 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and the denial of his renewal\n19 application must be declared unlawful and unconstitutional and set aside.\n20 INTRODUCTION\n21 1. Mr. Gonzalez was born in Mexico and brought to the United States at\n22 approximately 8 years old—16 years ago. Since that time, he has never left\n23 California, has no criminal history, and has been a productive member of his San\n24 Diego community.\n25 2. Mr. Gonzalez attended elementary and middle school in San Diego,\n26 where he graduated on time from high school in 2011. In January 2013,\n27 Defendants granted him permission to live and work lawfully in the United States\n28 pursuant to the DACA program. Defendants renewed Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n3\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.900   Page 5 of 46\n1 status in December 2014 until December 22, 2017. Both times, he was subject to\n2 rigorous biographic and biometric background checks, and paid $465 fees.\n3 3. Prior to receiving DACA status, from 2011 to 2013, Mr. Gonzalez\n4 was unable to secure employment because he was unwilling to misrepresent his\n5 immigration status. But thanks to his DACA-related employment authorization,\n6 Mr. Gonzalez quickly found lawful employment with an airline supply company in\n7 2013. He was tasked with stocking food and supplies on commercial flights for\n8 American Airlines. In addition to the rigorous vetting process he had undergone to\n9 obtain—and then renew—his DACA status and employment authorization, Mr.\n10 Gonzalez’s airline industry job required him to meet strict security protocols,\n11 including background checks and drug tests. He passed them all.\n12 4. On May 6, 2016, Mr. Gonzalez was detained by immigration officers\n13 while dog-sitting at a house where a CBP officer later alleged that undocumented\n14 immigrants were present. The very next day, CBP issued him a Notice to Appear\n15 (“NTA”) in Immigration Court. The NTA’s sole charge was unlawful presence in\n16 the United States under Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n17 (“INA”). See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (“present in the United States without\n18 being admitted or paroled”). The NTA did not contain any criminal allegations.\n19 5. After two days of questioning, Mr. Gonzalez was virtually ignored for\n20 nearly a month in immigration detention. CBP officers apparently lost interest in\n21 him and concluded that he was not involved in whatever events they were\n22 investigating. Ultimately, an Immigration Judge ordered Mr. Gonzalez released on\n23 a bond of only $5,000, after finding that he did not pose a threat to public safety.\n24 DHS did not object to or appeal the Immigration Judge’s findings or his decision.\n25 Since being released over 19 months ago, Mr. Gonzalez has resumed his life as a\n26 law-abiding and productive member of his San Diego community. To this day,\n27 Mr. Gonzalez has never been criminally charged or questioned again by any law\n28\n4\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.901   Page 6 of 46\n1 enforcement agency or officer in connection with the events of May 6, 2016. He\n2 appeared at every Immigration Court proceeding pursuant to his NTA.\n3 6. On May 23, 2016, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a “Notice of Action,”\n4 informing him that: “On May 7, 2016, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n5 issued you a Notice to Appear (NTA). USCIS is notifying you that your deferred\n6 action as a childhood arrival and your employment authorization terminated\n7 automatically as of the date your NTA [for unlawful presence] was issued.”\n8 7. On September 29, 2017, this Court vacated and preliminarily enjoined\n9 that automatic termination and ordered Defendants to reinstate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n10 DACA status and employment authorization, accept his renewal application, and\n11 fully comply with the DACA SOP if they wished to reconsider his DACA status.\n12 Any termination decision does not take effect until Defendants prove the\n13 termination’s lawfulness to the satisfaction of the Court.\n14 8. On November 13, 2017, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of\n15 Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”), explaining that it would not independently assess\n16 his DACA eligibility because ICE was litigating removal proceedings against him\n17 for unlawful presence. After the Immigration Judge terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s\n18 removal proceedings without prejudice, ICE issued a new NTA—again charging\n19 nothing but unlawful presence.\n20 9. The new NTA preceded Mr. Gonzalez’s response to the NOIT, and\n21 therefore indicated Defendants’ pre-judgment of whether Mr. Gonzalez might\n22 rightfully be deemed an “enforcement priority.” Tellingly, however, the new NTA\n23 still does not contain any criminal allegations.\n24 10. Therefore, while Defendants purport to have superficially complied\n25 with the DACA SOP by issuing an NOIT, their pre-judgment of the case and their\n26 decision to label Mr. Gonzalez an “enforcement priority” even though he has never\n27 been charged with or convicted of a crime is a violation of the DACA program’s\n28 non-prioritization of immigrants without any criminal history and the APA’s\n5\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.902   Page 7 of 46\n1 proscriptions against arbitrary and capricious action and unexplained policy\n2 changes.\n3 11. Moreover, Defendants’ revocation—through an informal review and\n4 determination of credibility and criminality—of the rights they granted Mr.\n5 Gonzalez to live and work in the United States is a blatant due process violation.\n6 12. The timing of Defendants’ purported termination is also telling.\n7 While they waited six weeks after the Court issued its Preliminary Injunction (and\n8 a year and a half after the incident of May 6, 2016) to issue the bare-bones NOIT,\n9 Defendants then issued Mr. Gonzalez’s termination notice only three days after\n10 receiving his NOIT response, and just one day before his DACA status was set to\n11 expire—in a seemingly pre-judged determination, and in an apparent effort to\n12 avoid considering his pending renewal application. As this Court warned, it\n13 “seems . . . this situation has been prejudged, and that this [NOIT procedure] is just\n14 going to be a pretext to get this guy out of the country, terminate his legal status,\n15 and [] do what it wanted to do in the beginning by the initial issuance of the NTA.”\n16 13. After growing up and obtaining his education in San Diego, Mr.\n17 Gonzalez has been a valued employee and productive member of his community.\n18 Defendants’ efforts to strip him of protection from removal from the only country\n19 he knows are unlawful and unconstitutional and must be set aside.\n20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n21 14. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n22 15. This Court has remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment\n23 Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.\n24 16. Venue is proper in the Southern District of California because a\n25 substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this\n26 District. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).\n27\n28\n6\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.903   Page 8 of 46\n1 PARTIES\n2 17. Mr. Gonzalez is a 24-year-old resident of San Diego, California. He\n3 was born in Mexico and brought to the United States in or around 2001, when he\n4 was approximately 8 years old. Pursuant to the DACA program, Defendants twice\n5 conferred on Mr. Gonzalez the right to live and work in this country—for set\n6 periods subject to renewal—after lengthy application processes, rigorous security\n7 vetting, and substantial fee payments. He is a valued employee with no criminal\n8 history.\n9 18. DHS is a cabinet department of the United States federal government\n10 with responsibility for, among other things, administering and enforcing the\n11 nation’s immigration laws. Its stated mission is to “safeguard the American\n12 people, our homeland, and our values.” U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\n13 “Our Mission.”1\n14 19. USCIS is a federal agency within DHS “that oversees lawful\n15 immigration to the United States.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,\n16 “About Us.”2 USCIS administers the DACA program, including collection of\n17 forms, documents, and fees; issuance of DACA approval and employment\n18 authorization notices; and issuance of termination notices. USCIS previously\n19 “automatically” terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD without notice\n20 or an opportunity to be heard, and now purports to unlawfully and\n21 unconstitutionally terminate his DACA status and deny his renewal application.\n22 20. ICE is a law enforcement agency within DHS that “enforces federal\n23 laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote\n24 homeland security and public safety.” U.S. Immigration and Customs\n25 Enforcement, “Who We Are.”3\n26\n27\n1 https://www.dhs.gov/our-mission (last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n28\n2 https://www.uscis.gov/aboutus (last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n3 https://www.ice.gov/about (last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n7\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.904   Page 9 of 46\n1 21. CBP is a law enforcement agency within DHS that “is charged with\n2 keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful\n3 international travel and trade.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “About\n4 CBP.”4 CBP issued Mr. Gonzalez’s initial NTA charging unlawful presence in the\n5 United States.\n6 22. Defendants Does 1-10 are currently unidentified individuals whose\n7 actions, in addition to those of named Defendants, gave rise to Mr. Gonzalez’s\n8 claims.\n9 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n10 Establishment and Terms of the DACA Program\n11 23. On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet\n12 Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program. See June 15,\n13 2012 Memorandum from Janet Napolitano to ICE, CBP, and USCIS, “Exercising\n14 Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United\n15 States as Children” (“DACA Memo”).5 The DACA Memo explained that the\n16 “Nation’s immigration laws . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without\n17 consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case” and that\n18 “additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are\n19 not expended on [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on\n20 people who meet our enforcement priorities.” Its purpose is to protect “certain\n21 young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this\n22 country as home [because] these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law.”\n23 A DACA recipient who meets certain objectively verifiable criteria is, by\n24 definition, a “low priority case” and does not “meet [DHS’s] enforcement\n25 priorities.”\n26\n27\n4 https://www.cbp.gov/about (last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n28\n5 https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-\nindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf.\n8\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.905   Page 10 of 46\n1 24. Accordingly, Defendants enacted a program of deferred action for\n2 individuals who were brought to the United States as children and meet specific\n3 criteria. Deferred action is a well-established form of administrative action by\n4 which the Executive Branch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain\n5 from seeking an individual’s removal from the country and authorizes his\n6 continued lawful presence for a specified period.\n7 25. A recipient of deferred action is eligible to receive employment\n8 authorization. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c). The DACA Memo directed USCIS to\n9 “accept applications to determine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work\n10 authorization during [their] period of deferred action.”\n11 26. President Obama explained that “it makes no sense to expel talented\n12 young people, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans – they’ve been\n13 raised as Americans; understand themselves to be part of this country . . . [and]\n14 want to staff our labs, or start new businesses, or defend our country.”\n15 Accordingly, the President explained that DHS would be “taking steps to lift the\n16 shadow of deportation from these young people” and giving them “a degree of\n17 relief and hope.” The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by\n18 the President on Immigration” (“Obama Remarks”) (June 15, 2012).6\n19 27. The DACA Memo established that the following DACA criteria:\n20  came to the United States under the age of 16;\n21  continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding the\n22 date of the memorandum and was present in the United States on the date of the\n23 memorandum;\n24  is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general\n25 education development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the\n26 Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;\n27\n28\n6 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-\npresident-immigration.\n9\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.906   Page 11 of 46\n1  has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense,\n2 or multiple misdemeanor offenses, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national\n3 security or public safety; and\n4  is not above the age of 30.\n5 28. The DACA Memo also directed that “[n]o individual should receive\n6 deferred action . . . unless they first pass a background check.”\n7 29. USCIS was tasked with implementing the DACA program, including\n8 collection of forms, documents, and fees and issuance of DACA approval and\n9 employment authorization notices. Defendants promulgated a public policy\n10 document detailing how the DACA program operates. See USCIS, “DACA\n11 Frequently Asked Questions” (“DACA FAQ”).7\n12 30. Defendants also developed non-discretionary internal policies for all\n13 government personnel implementing the DACA program, known as the DACA\n14 Standard Operating Procedures, or “SOP.”\n15 31. Until the program’s rescission in September 2017, a DACA recipient\n16 could apply for renewal every 2 years. A renewal applicant had to reapply, pass\n17 another round of background checks, and pay another $495. Renewal requires that\n18 the recipient “met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA” and:\n19  did not depart the United States on or after August 15, 2012 without advance\n20 parole;\n21  has continuously resided in the United States since submitting his most recent\n22 request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; and\n23  has not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more\n24 misdemeanors, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public\n25 safety.\n26\n27\n28\n7 https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions (updated Oct. 6, 2017;\nlast visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n10\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.907   Page 12 of 46\n1 32. Since DACA’s inception, these objective criteria have served as the\n2 determinative basis for USCIS’s individual DACA decisions. See Texas v. U.S.,\n3 809 F.3d 134, 171-76 (5th Cir. 2015).\n4 33. In 2015, USCIS further screened all individuals who had been granted\n5 DACA status “to identify records that contained information indicating known or\n6 suspected gang association.” Apr. 17, 2015 Letter from USCIS Director Leon\n7 Rodriguez to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley (“Rodriguez\n8 Letter”).8\n9 34. A DACA recipient “may obtain employment authorization from\n10 USCIS provided [he or she] can demonstrate an economic necessity for\n11 employment.” DACA FAQ, Q4. Upon approval, the recipient receives an\n12 Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”).\n13 35. “An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by\n14 DHS to be present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be\n15 lawfully present during the period deferred action is in effect.” DACA FAQ, Q1.\n16 36. DACA determinations are separate and independent from any removal\n17 proceedings in Immigration Court. Even an individual who (1) is in removal\n18 proceedings, (2) has a final order of removal, or (3) has a voluntary departure order\n19 is eligible for DACA status. See DACA FAQ, Q10. Indeed, the DACA SOP\n20 requires review of DACA eligibility even for individuals who were removed\n21 pursuant to a final removal order but illegally reentered the country.\n22 Rescission of the DACA Program\n23 37. From January to September 5, 2017, the Trump administration\n24 continued to process and grant new DACA applications, renewal applications, and\n25 EADs.\n26 38. On September 5, DHS announced a plan to phase out the DACA\n27 program over a two-year period. DACA recipients whose statuses were set to\n28\n8 https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-04-\n17%20USCIS%20to%20CEG%20(DACA%20for%20Gang%20Member).pdf.\n11\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.908   Page 13 of 46\n1 expire before March 6, 2018 were permitted to apply for renewal by October 5,\n2 2017. See Sept. 5, 2017 Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke to ICE, CBP, and\n3 USCIS, “Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action for Child Arrivals”\n4 (“Duke Memo”).9\n5 39. Before and after the rescission, the administration made clear that the\n6 rules governing DACA recipients had not changed, and that DACA recipients\n7 would not be deemed enforcement priorities in a manner inconsistent with the\n8 DACA program. Indeed, on April 21, 2017, President Trump—using the common\n9 term for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children—\n10 assured that the administration is “not after the dreamers.” He was asked, “that’s\n11 going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?” The\n12 President responded unequivocally: “Yes. Yes. That’s our policy.” He\n13 elaborated: “The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I’ll give you that. The dreamers\n14 should rest easy.” Associated Press, “Transcript of AP Interview with Trump”\n15 (“Trump Interview”) (published Apr. 23, 2017).10\n16 40. On February 20, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security (and\n17 current White House Chief of Staff) John Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth\n18 DHS’s immigration enforcement priorities. See Feb. 20, 2017 Memorandum from\n19 John Kelly to ICE, CBP, and USCIS, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to\n20 Serve the National Interest” (“Kelly Memo”).11 The Kelly Memo “immediately\n21 rescinded” “all existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance\n22 regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and priorities for removal,” but\n23 specifically exempted the June 15, 2012 DACA Memo.\n24 41. The Kelly Memo prioritizes for removal non-DACA recipients who\n25 merely “have been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved”\n26\n27 9 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca.\n10 https://www.apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83.\n28\n11 https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-\nof-the-Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf.\n12\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.909   Page 14 of 46\n1 or allegedly “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” But\n2 by the Memo’s own terms, the enforcement priority for individuals subject to an\n3 allegation or suspicion of wrongdoing without a conviction or criminal charge does\n4 not apply to DACA recipients.\n5 42. On February 21, 2017, DHS again unequivocally stated that the Kelly\n6 Memo’s enforcement priorities have no bearing on DACA recipients:\n7 Q22: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred\nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?\n8 A22: No.\n9 DHS, “Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Enhancing Public\n10 Safety in the Interior of the United States (Feb. 20, 2017).12\n11 43. On June 15, 2017, DHS issued more public guidance, explaining that\n12 “DACA recipients will continue to be eligible as outlined in the June 15, 2012\n13 memorandum.” DHS, “Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Memorandum\n14 Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent\n15 Residents (‘DAPA’)” (June 15, 2017).13\n16 44. Following the announcement of the DACA rescission plan, the\n17 administration explained that “[d]uring this six-month time, there are no changes\n18 that are being made to the program at this point.” The White House, “Press\n19 Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Homeland Security Advisor Tom\n20 Bossert” (Sept. 8, 2017).\n21 45. And again on October 3, 2017, DHS assured the Senate Judiciary\n22 Committee regarding its enforcement priorities: “We rely on guidance that was put\n23 in place in 2012 when the DACA program was initiated. That’s available on\n24 USCIS’s website and will tell you what the priorities are for Immigration and\n25 Customs Enforcement and what they are for the Department at large. Those\n26\n27 12 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/02/21/qa-dhs-implementation-executive-order-\nenhancing-public-safety-interior-united-states.\n28\n13 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/06/15/frequently-asked-questions-rescission-\nmemorandum-providing-deferred-action-parents.\n13\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.910   Page 15 of 46\n1 priorities have not changed.” Testimony of Michael Dougherty, Assistant\n2 Secretary of DHS at 01:10:20, “Oversight of the Administration’s Decision to End\n3 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,” available at https://bit.ly/2fzVNEY; id.\n4 at 01:11:00 (the Kelly Memo “carved out” DACA from its enforcement priorities;\n5 “I would tell you in good faith and complete confidence that we are relying on the\n6 same priorities that were in place in 2012 and we have not added to them for this\n7 population.”).14\n8 46. In short, DACA recipients who meet the program’s objectively\n9 verifiable criteria—i.e., have no disqualifying criminal convictions and do not pose\n10 a threat to national security or public safety—remain “low priority cases.” The\n11 government has issued no guidance indicating a change in that position.\n12 DACA Application and Renewal Process\n13 47. A DACA applicant had to submit to USCIS: (1) Form I-821D,\n14 Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; (2) Form I-765,\n15 Application for Employment Authorization; (3) Form I-765WS, Worksheet\n16 establishing economic need for employment; and (4) extensive documentation to\n17 establish that he or she meets the DACA Memo’s eligibility criteria and USCIS’s\n18 implementing criteria. See DACA FAQ, Q7, Q28-Q41.\n19 48. A DACA applicant had to “undergo biographic and biometric\n20 background checks before USCIS [would] consider [his or her] request.” DACA\n21 FAQ, Q22. This involved checking biographic and biometric information “against\n22 a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government agencies.”\n23 DACA FAQ, Q23.\n24 49. To be considered, an applicant also paid a $495 fee, which “cannot be\n25 waived.” USCIS, “I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood\n26 Arrivals.”15\n27\n14 https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/oversight-of-the-administrations-\n28\ndecision-to-end-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals.\n15 https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d (updated Oct. 6, 2017; last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n14\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.911   Page 16 of 46\n1 50. A DACA renewal applicant had to submit the same forms, undergo\n2 another round of biographic and biometric background checks, and pay another\n3 $495 fee. USCIS, Form I-821D, OMB No. 1615-0124.16\n4 51. If the background checks or other information indicate that the\n5 applicant’s presence “threatens public safety or national security,” deferred action\n6 will be denied absent “exceptional circumstances.” Indicators of such a threat\n7 include gang membership, participation in certain criminal activities, or\n8 participation in activities that threaten the United States. DACA FAQ, Q65.\n9 52. In 2015, USCIS further screened all individuals who had been granted\n10 DACA status “to identify records that contained information indicating known or\n11 suspected gang association.” Apr. 17, 2015 Letter from USCIS Director Leon\n12 Rodriguez to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley.17\n13 53. Even an individual (1) in removal proceedings, (2) with a final order\n14 of removal, or (3) with a voluntary departure order is eligible for DACA status.\n15 See DACA FAQ, Q7.\n16 DACA Termination Policies\n17 54. The DACA SOP governs USCIS’s implementation of the DACA\n18 program. It incorporates a 2011 USCIS Memo and the relevant procedures set\n19 forth therein.\n20 55. Under the DACA SOP, “[i]f disqualifying criminal offenses or public\n21 safety concerns . . . arise after” DACA status is granted, USCIS must issue the\n22 recipient a “Notice of Intent to Terminate” (“NOIT”) and “allow [him or her] 33\n23 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited” therein. DHS,\n24 “National Standard Operating Procedures, Deferred Action for Childhood\n25 Arrivals” (“DACA SOP”), Chapter 14 (Aug. 28, 2013).\n26\n27 16 https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-821dinstr.pdf?download=1\n(archived content).\n28\n17 https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-04-\n17%20USCIS%20to%20CEG%20(DACA%20for%20Gang%20Member).pdf.\n15\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.912   Page 17 of 46\n1 56. The exception to this rule is when USCIS follows a specific protocol\n2 for cases involving Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) concerns. If USCIS suspects\n3 that a particular DACA recipient poses an EPS concern, it must send the case to\n4 the Background Check Unit (“BCU”) DACA Team for consideration. If BCU\n5 suspects an EPS concern, it must refer the case to ICE to make a determination.\n6 DACA SOP, Chapter 14; Nov. 7, 2011 USCIS Policy Memorandum (“USCIS\n7 Memo”) at 3.18\n8 57. “All EPS cases must be referred to ICE” for “an opportunity to decide\n9 if, when, and how to issue an NTA . . . . USCIS will not issue an NTA in these\n10 cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA. . . . This referral process is utilized in order\n11 to give ICE the opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action before\n12 USCIS adjudicates the case.” USCIS Memo at 4. If, and only if, ICE issues an\n13 NTA on the basis of an EPS concern, USCIS may then terminate an individual’s\n14 DACA status without providing prior notice or an opportunity to be heard. ICE’s\n15 issuance of an NTA after an EPS referral is meant to allow USCIS to “proceed\n16 with adjudication, . . . taking into account the basis for the NTA.” USCIS Memo at\n17 4.\n18 58. If ICE issues an NTA based on an EPS concern, USCIS will terminate\n19 DACA status “automatically,” without an NOIT or opportunity to respond.\n20 Neither the DACA SOP nor the USCIS Memo authorizes termination without\n21 notice when CBP issues an NTA or in the absence of an EPS determination by\n22 ICE. In such instances, an NOIT and 33 days to respond are required. An EPS\n23 referral does not require being charged or convicted of any crime. It requires only\n24 “information indicat[ing] the alien is under investigation for, has been arrested for\n25 (without disposition), or has been convicted of” one of a list of crimes, defined in\n26 Section 101 of the INA. USCIS Memo at 3.\n27\n18\n28\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_M\nemoranda/NTA%20PM%20%28Approved%20as%20final%2011-7-11%29.pdf.\n16\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.913   Page 18 of 46\n1 59. If ICE makes an EPS determination, USCIS affords a DACA recipient\n2 no opportunity to contest the grounds.\n3 60. An individual who is not suspected of being an EPS concern—but\n4 who has committed a “disqualifying criminal offense” or whose continuing DACA\n5 status is “not consistent with [DHS’s] enforcement priorities”—must be issued an\n6 NOIT with 33 days to “file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in the”\n7 NOIT.\n8 The Government’s Representations to DACA Applicants and Recipients\n9 61. DACA status confers numerous benefits on a recipient as part of\n10 Defendants’ recognition that the United States “continue[s] to benefit . . . from the\n11 contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing\n12 more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Dec. 30, 2016\n13 Letter from then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles Johnson to\n14 Representative Judy Chu (“Johnson Letter”) at 2.19\n15 62. In 2016, over 100 members of Congress sought confirmation that\n16 DACA applicants’ personal identifying information would be safeguarded. DHS\n17 affirmed that its “representations” that such information would not be used for\n18 “other immigration-related purposes . . . must continue to be honored.”\n19 Defendants understand that “DACA applicants most assuredly relied” on their\n20 representations. Dec. 30, 2016 Johnson Letter at 1-2.\n21 63. More broadly, the DACA SOP codifies Defendants’ commitment to\n22 the DACA program, effectively limiting the exercise of agency discretion with\n23 “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions” for granting, denying, and terminating\n24 deferred action. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 173 (citing the DACA SOP as evidence\n25 that DACA is not a truly discretionary program), aff’d by an equally divided Court,\n26 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016).\n27\n19\n28\nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Respon\nse%20to%20Chu%2012.30.16.pdf.\n17\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.914   Page 19 of 46\n1 64. Executive and Legislative Branch officials from both political parties\n2 have reinforced the promises of the DACA program. They have publicly\n3 acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of DACA applicants and recipients have\n4 relied on Defendants to (1) honor the benefits conferred by DACA and (2)\n5 implement and enforce it without policies or actions that are arbitrary, capricious,\n6 an abuse of discretion, contrary to internal policies, or unconstitutional.\n7  In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that the government\n8 must ensure “that the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” DACA recipients and\n9 their families, because they have “organize[d] [their] li[ves] around” the DACA\n10 program. CNN, “Transcripts: Town Hall Meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan”\n11 (Jan. 12, 2017).20\n12  In February 2017, Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva called on the\n13 government to “honor its word to protect” those who came forward “expecting”\n14 the government to uphold its “commitment.” Congressional Progressive Caucus,\n15 “Congressional Progressive Caucus Leaders Respond to ICE Arrest of DACA\n16 Recipient” (Feb. 16, 2017).21\n17  In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary Kelly reaffirmed that DACA status “is a\n18 commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person.” Ted Hesson and\n19 Seung Min Kim, “Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration,”\n20 Politico (Mar. 29, 2017).22\n21  And in April 2017, President Trump reiterated that “dreamers should rest easy.”\n22 Apr. 21, 2017 Trump Interview.\n23 65. Defendants’ reassurances that no changes were being made to the\n24 DACA program during its wind-down bolstered the mutual understanding that\n25\n26\n20 https://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1701/12/se.01.html.\n27 21 https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/press-releases/congressional-progressive-caucus-\nleaders-respond-to-ice-arrest-of-daca-recipient/.\n28\n22 https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/wary-dems-look-to-kelly-for-answers-\non-immigration-236673.\n18\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.915   Page 20 of 46\n1 DACA confers Constitutionally significant benefits in the form of the right to\n2 lawfully live and work in the United States.\n3 Benefits Conferred by Defendants on DACA Recipients\n4 66. DACA status confers numerous benefits on a recipient. Chief among\n5 them is USCIS’s explanation that a DACA recipient “is authorized by DHS to be\n6 present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully\n7 present during the period deferred action is in effect.” DACA FAQ, Q1; see\n8 Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1058-59 (9th Cir. 2014)\n9 (“DHS considers DACA recipients not to be unlawfully present in the United\n10 States because their deferred action is a period of stay authorized by the Attorney\n11 General.”) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3)); Texas\n12 v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148 (“[L]awful presence” has “significant legal\n13 consequences.”).\n14 67. Because DACA recipients are lawfully present, DHS and USCIS have\n15 directed ICE and CBP “to prevent qualifying individuals from being apprehended,\n16 placed into removal proceedings, or removed.” DACA FAQ, Q9.\n17 68. In the course of Mr. Gonzalez’s removal proceedings, ICE explained\n18 in open court that DACA is “permission” to live in the United States.\n19 69. DACA recipients are also eligible for a DACA-specific EAD “for the\n20 period of deferred action,” for which they would otherwise be ineligible. DACA\n21 FAQ, Q1; see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12, Category (c)(33).23\n22 70. DACA recipients may apply for certain federal public benefits for\n23 which they would otherwise be ineligible, including Social Security retirement\n24 benefits, Social Security disability benefits, and Medicare Part A health insurance\n25 benefits. See 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(2)-(3). They may also be eligible for state public\n26\n27\n23 https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/information-employers-\n28\nemployees/employer-information/employment-authorization (updated Oct. 24,\n2017; last visited Dec. 29, 2017).\n19\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.916   Page 21 of 46\n1 benefits, including a driver’s license and unemployment insurance. See 8 U.S.C. §\n2 1621(d); accord Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n3 71. DACA recipients, by virtue of obtaining Social Security Numbers, are\n4 also afforded ancillary benefits that are typically unavailable or difficult to obtain\n5 for undocumented immigrants, including opening a bank account, obtaining a\n6 credit card, starting a business, purchasing a home or car, and obtaining financial\n7 aid for higher education.\n8 72. DACA recipients do not accrue time for unlawful presence for\n9 admissibility purposes under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). See DACA FAQ, Q5.\n10 And—prior to a September 5 change in policy regarding advance parole—for\n11 certain humanitarian, educational, and employment purposes, recipients could\n12 briefly leave the country and legally return, a benefit that Defendants do not afford\n13 to those they does not deem lawfully present. See DACA FAQ, Q57.\n14 73. In short, “lawful presence removes the categorical bar” to certain\n15 public benefits and participation in several crucial elements of social, civic, and\n16 economic life in the United States. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n17 74. In other words, Defendants have taken steps to “lift the shadow of\n18 deportation from these young people” and given them “a degree of relief and\n19 hope.” June 15, 2012 Obama Remarks. As a result of DACA, hundreds of\n20 thousands of Dreamers “have been able to enroll in colleges and universities,\n21 complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and give\n22 back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and\n23 entrepreneurs—all on the books.” Dec. 30, 2016 Johnson Letter at 2.\n24 75. Of course, these benefits were not unilaterally conferred. Defendants\n25 granted these benefits in exchange for recipients’ personal, financial, and criminal\n26 history information and substantial fee payments, and the expectation of\n27 consideration for renewal.\n28\n20\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.917   Page 22 of 46\n1 76. These benefits, once conferred—and consistently reaffirmed by\n2 Defendants’ subsequent policies and public statements—have created a reasonable\n3 expectation that Defendants would abide by the terms of the DACA program and\n4 would not reverse course on DACA recipients’ status as low priority cases or\n5 terminate or deny renewal without disqualifying criminal offenses or stated public\n6 safety concerns.\n7 Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA Status and Employment Authorization\n8 77. Mr. Gonzalez graduated on time from Altus Charter High School in\n9 San Diego in 2011. Despite the support of his family and friends, he was unable to\n10 secure lawful employment from 2011 to 2013 because he was unwilling to\n11 misrepresent his immigration status to prospective employers.\n12 78. In 2013, Mr. Gonzalez learned of the DACA program. He expended\n13 significant time and resources filling out the USCIS forms; gathering the necessary\n14 supporting evidence and documentation; attending a biometrics appointment where\n15 his photograph and fingerprints were taken; and paying the $465 filing fee.\n16 79. Mr. Gonzalez provided Defendants his birth certificate; school records\n17 from childhood to graduation, including report cards and certificates of\n18 achievement; several years of his family’s tax returns; and his prior addresses, all\n19 of which are in San Diego.\n20 80. Ultimately, Defendants granted Mr. Gonzalez DACA status and\n21 employment authorization on January 22, 2013, valid until January 21, 2015.\n22 81. In 2014, Mr. Gonzalez timely applied for renewal of his DACA status\n23 and EAD, again complying with the paperwork and biographic and biometric\n24 background checks, and paying the same substantial fee. Upon review of these\n25 materials, Defendants granted Mr. Gonzalez’s renewal application, deeming him\n26 lawfully present and authorized to work in the United States until December 22,\n27 2017 with the expectation of appropriate consideration for renewal.\n28\n21\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.918   Page 23 of 46\n1 82. In 2015, USCIS further screened all individuals who had been granted\n2 DACA status “to identify records that contained information indicating known or\n3 suspected gang association.” See Rodriguez Letter, supra.\n4 83. Defendants therefore confirmed, on at least three separate occasions,\n5 that Mr. Gonzalez is deserving of DACA status and its benefits and does not pose a\n6 threat to national security or public safety.\n7 84. They reaffirmed these determinations in the course of this litigation,\n8 stating on December 8, 2017 that they “do not take issue with [Mr. Gonzalez’s]\n9 ability to meet the DACA guidelines going forward.”\n10 Mr. Gonzalez’s Employment\n11 85. With EAD in hand, Mr. Gonzalez sought and quickly obtained\n12 employment in 2013. He was hired to perform food and equipment setup and\n13 stocking for Gate Gourmet, a provider of airline catering and provision services.\n14 Because he was preparing trays that were carried on commercial aircraft, Mr.\n15 Gonzalez’s employer required that he pass additional security tests, including\n16 interviews, drug tests, security clearance protocols, and EAD verification. He\n17 passed all of them.\n18 86. Mr. Gonzalez was a dutiful and trusted employee for nearly three\n19 years. He was primarily responsible for provisioning seven flights, five nights a\n20 week for American Airlines, but was often tasked with helping others who were\n21 responsible for Canada Air, Delta, Hawaiian, United, and US Airways. From the\n22 time he was hired to the time of his inexplicable detention, Mr. Gonzalez worked\n23 five nights a week from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. Upon coming home\n24 to his shared apartment, he often slept much of the day before returning to work in\n25 the evening.\n26 87. Mr. Gonzalez was saving up to buy his own car, but after he was\n27 detained, he was forced to divert those savings to securing his release.\n28\n22\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.919   Page 24 of 46\n1 88. When Mr. Gonzalez was released from his month-long detention, he\n2 voluntarily informed Gate Gourmet that his EAD had been terminated. He had to\n3 be let go, but his employer asked him to reapply when his EAD or other\n4 employment authorization was restored.\n5 89. Mr. Gonzalez’s employers have praised his “work ethic, dedication,\n6 and consistency.” One of them wrote to USCIS to “recommend that he continue to\n7 be provided the opportunity to be gainfully employed here” because he “would\n8 [be] highly recommended [] to any future employer.”\n9 Mr. Gonzalez’s Detention and Release\n10 90. On May 6, 2016, an acquaintance known to Mr. Gonzalez only as\n11 “Adolfo” asked him to come to his home and care for his dogs for the afternoon\n12 while Adolfo was out of town. Mr. Gonzalez agreed, having previously done so\n13 without any issues. He arrived at Adolfo’s home sometime between 11:30 a.m.\n14 and 1:00 p.m.\n15 91. Mr. Gonzalez entered the unlocked home and was surprised to\n16 discover that two people were already there. One was a male acquaintance whom\n17 Mr. Gonzalez recognized as “Romeo,” and the other was a woman he did not\n18 know.\n19 92. Having fed and cleaned up after the dogs, and realizing that others\n20 were there to look after them, Mr. Gonzalez considered leaving. But he was\n21 without transportation.\n22 93. For the rest of the afternoon, Mr. Gonzalez kept to himself, passing\n23 the time watching movies and television while he waited for his ride to his regular\n24 early-evening-to-early-morning work shift.\n25 94. At approximately 4:00 p.m., a law enforcement officer knocked on the\n26 front door and asked to enter the house. Mr. Gonzalez felt it was inappropriate to\n27 allow anyone into someone else’s home without a search warrant. He said so to\n28\n23\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.920   Page 25 of 46\n1 the officers, who stopped trying to enter the house and stopped speaking to him.\n2 But Mr. Gonzalez noticed that the officers continued to surround the house.\n3 95. About an hour later, a man Mr. Gonzalez did not recognize arrived at\n4 the house with the law enforcement officers. He identified himself as the owner\n5 and asked Mr. Gonzalez to exit.\n6 96. By that time, Mr. Gonzalez knew he would soon have to leave for\n7 work. His manager had an unforgiving policy toward tardiness, and Mr. Gonzalez\n8 believed he would have little difficulty resolving the situation with law\n9 enforcement and being allowed to go to work—because he had DACA status and\n10 had done nothing wrong.\n11 97. Mr. Gonzalez (and Romeo) exited the house. Relying on Defendants’\n12 assurances—publicly and in his DACA approval notices—that DACA status\n13 barred his apprehension as long as he had not committed any crimes (which he had\n14 not) Mr. Gonzalez informed the officers of his DACA status and of his need to get\n15 to work.\n16 98. Mr. Gonzalez had his valid DACA EAD with C-33 classification with\n17 him. He handed it to one of the officers for verification.\n18 99. After that officer walked away, a second officer told Mr. Gonzalez\n19 that he would be detained. Mr. Gonzalez asked why, to which the officer replied\n20 that he was in the country illegally and his DACA status did not matter. A third\n21 officer abruptly grabbed Mr. Gonzalez by the arm and handcuffed him.\n22 100. Romeo was taken away in handcuffs, and the officer who threatened\n23 Mr. Gonzalez with detention and the officer who handcuffed him went inside the\n24 house.\n25 101. At no point did any officer indicate that their investigation targeted\n26 Mr. Gonzalez.\n27 102. Mr. Gonzalez sat on the front porch—handcuffed—unable to see\n28 inside the house. He heard no sounds coming from inside the house. He did not\n24\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.921   Page 26 of 46\n1 see or hear anyone else go in or out of the house. Within a couple of minutes—\n2 without further questioning or explanation—the officer who was checking Mr.\n3 Gonzalez’s immigration status put him in a police car and took him away. Mr.\n4 Gonzalez did not see that officer speak to or engage with anyone who went inside\n5 the house.\n6 103. Mr. Gonzalez was taken to a detention facility, where he was\n7 questioned by a handful of officers, one at a time. They did not ask any specific or\n8 pointed questions. Mr. Gonzalez repeatedly answered to the effect of, “I don’t\n9 understand why I’m being detained.”\n10 104. During the questioning, officers threatened to arrest his (unspecified)\n11 family members. These threats were not based on any allegations of wrongdoing.\n12 105. Seeing and fearing the officers’ hostility and willingness to threaten\n13 him and his family for reasons he did not understand, Mr. Gonzalez handed over\n14 his phone.\n15 106. The officers looked through the contacts and communications, asking\n16 who certain names were. Mr. Gonzalez gave them the boring answers: “my soccer\n17 buddy,” “my ex-girlfriend,” “my brother,” and so on. He saw the disappointment\n18 in the officers’ faces as they scoured the phone’s contents.\n19 107. For two or three days, Mr. Gonzalez was denied food, deliberately\n20 woken up with loud bangs by officers (who laughed at his shocked fear), and\n21 threatened with arrest of his family.\n22 108. After that, the officers apparently lost interest in Mr. Gonzalez.\n23 109. He was transferred to a second facility. For approximately a week he\n24 was ignored. No one came to question him, and his requests for an explanation or\n25 right to call his family simply went unanswered.\n26 110. Subsequently, Mr. Gonzalez was transferred to a third facility, where\n27 he was finally permitted to contact his family after approximately ten days in\n28 detention.\n25\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.922   Page 27 of 46\n1 111. For the final three weeks or more of Mr. Gonzalez’s detention, law\n2 enforcement officers continued to ignore him.\n3 112. The questioning ceased entirely. After the initial two days of threats,\n4 abuse, and unsubstantiated accusations, the officers apparently concluded what Mr.\n5 Gonzalez told them all along: that he had no part in the events at Adolfo’s house\n6 that concerned them and was not a person of interest.\n7 113. On June 1, 2016—nearly a month after his unwarranted and unlawful\n8 detention—Immigration Judge McSeveney ordered Mr. Gonzalez released from\n9 custody on a mere $5,000 bond. Judge McSeveney fond him credible and stated\n10 that Mr. Gonzalez was not a danger to the public.\n11 114. DHS did not object to the Immigration Court’s findings or decision\n12 and waived appeal.\n13 115. Mr. Gonzalez was finally released on June 3, 2016.\n14 116. Mr. Gonzalez has not been questioned or investigated since. Indeed,\n15 he has not had a single run-in with law enforcement before or after May 6, 2016.\n16 117. On May 7, 2016 (the day after Mr. Gonzalez’s arrest), CBP agent\n17 Andrew Bolton issued DHS Form I-213, “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible\n18 Alien.” It affirms Mr. Gonzalez’s lack of a criminal record (“None Known”) and\n19 gives a narrative of the events of May 6. It alleges that law enforcement officers\n20 were “relayed” information that at around 8:30 a.m. (several hours before Mr.\n21 Gonzalez arrived at the house) a male individual escorted five individuals who\n22 “appeared” to have been “recently smuggled into the United States” into the house.\n23 The narrative affirms the presence of Roman Rodriguez (“Romeo”) at the house\n24 when officers arrived at approximately 4:20 p.m., and also describes another “male\n25 individual, later identified to be the dweller of the detached garage, [who] exited\n26 the property through the rear of the house towards an alley.”\n27 118. The I-213 describes Mr. Gonzalez as “nervous” when several law\n28 enforcement officers descended on him. Among other inaccuracies, it mistakenly\n26\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.923   Page 28 of 46\n1 indicates that Mr. Gonzalez told the officers it was up to his sister (who has never\n2 had any connection to the house or the circumstances of this case) to give\n3 permission to enter the house.\n4 119. The narrative affirms that the door to the house was left unlocked and\n5 that Mr. Gonzalez “did not even have the key to the property.”\n6 120. While the I-213 states that Mr. Gonzalez was “booked for\n7 Administrative Alien Smuggling” and was “being processed for removal\n8 proceedings,” the May 7, 2016 NTA commencing those proceedings did not\n9 charge alien smuggling—the sole stated basis for removal was unlawful presence.\n10 121. DHS Form I-831, “Report of Investigation,” also prepared on May 7,\n11 2016, details incriminating statements extracted in the course of interviews with\n12 everyone encountered at the house that day. Tellingly, although it indicates what\n13 the other undocumented immigrants said to incriminate themselves in their\n14 interviews, it says nothing about any derogatory information learned in the course\n15 of interviewing Mr. Gonzalez, who made every effort to cooperate with the\n16 officers and even turned over his phone to them.\n17 122. Pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Mr.\n18 Gonzalez on July 19, 2017, on December 26, 2017 (after the second purported\n19 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status) ICE provided more records created\n20 contemporaneous to Mr. Gonzalez’s detention. Those records:\n21  contain the hand-written notations “No crim” and “First imm app”;\n22  under the “Event/Incident Information” heading, describe the “Event Type” as\n23 “Administrative Non-Criminal Individual”;\n24  under the “Subject Information” heading, describe Mr. Gonzalez’s “Priority” as\n25 “N/A” and his “Criminal Type” as “N/A.”\n26 USCIS’s Automatic Termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA Status and EAD\n27 123. On May 7, 2016—the day after Mr. Gonzalez’s arrest—CBP issued\n28 him an NTA. Its sole charge was that Mr. Gonzalez is unlawfully present in the\n27\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.924   Page 29 of 46\n1 United States under Section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The\n2 NTA made no other allegations.\n3 124. On May 23, 2016, USCIS sent Mr. Gonzalez a “Notice of Action,”\n4 explaining that: “On May 7, 2016, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued\n5 you a Notice to Appear (NTA). USCIS is notifying you that your deferred action\n6 as a childhood arrival and your employment authorization terminated automatically\n7 as of the date your NTA [for unlawful presence] was issued.”\n8 125. Because this purported automatic termination has no basis in the\n9 DACA SOP, see supra ¶¶ 54-60, it violates the APA.\n10 126. This Court vacated and preliminarily enjoined the termination as\n11 violating the DACA SOP and the APA. In so doing, the Court held that Mr.\n12 Gonzalez\n13 “will suffer significant irreparable harm in the absence of\n14 an injunction by losing his DACA status and the ability\n15 to apply for renewal of that status. The potential harm\n16 caused by Defendants’ conduct includes the loss of\n17 employment, a core benefit under DACA. The\n18 deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s ability to\n19 financially provide for himself and his family. The loss\n20 of DACA status also undermines one’s sense of well-\n21 being and subjects Plaintiff to a constant threat of\n22 apprehension and possible removal from the only country\n23 he has called home.”\n24 127. The Court ordered Defendants to reinstate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n25 status and EAD and to “fully comply with the DACA SOP should Defendants elect\n26 to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status.” The Court also required Defendants to\n27 accept (and presumably fairly consider) Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA renewal\n28 application.\n28\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.925   Page 30 of 46\n1 128. The Court’s Preliminary Injunction “order is to remain in effect\n2 pending further Order of this court.”\n3 129. Defendants must prove the termination’s lawfulness to the satisfaction\n4 of the Court, as the harms flowing from the initial unlawful termination have not\n5 abated.\n6 130. With his current DACA status set to expire on December 22, 2017,\n7 Mr. Gonzalez submitted a timely DACA renewal application on October 4, 2017.\n8 131. Following a Master Calendar Hearing on November 16, 2017, San\n9 Diego Immigration Judge Law terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s removal proceedings\n10 without prejudice.\n11 The NOIT Process\n12 132. On November 13, 2017, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of\n13 Intent to Terminate his DACA status. The NOIT provided Mr. Gonzalez 33 days\n14 to “submit any evidence that you feel will overcome the grounds for termination.”\n15 133. The NOIT explained: “Since DHS has determined that you are an\n16 enforcement priority and ICE has informed USCIS that it is actively pursuing your\n17 removal, USCIS will not contemporaneously conclude that removal action should\n18 continue to be deferred in your case.”\n19 134. The NOIT did not provide any facts in support of the sudden\n20 “enforcement priority” assertion. Nor did it cite to any new DHS policy indicating\n21 that merely being in removal proceedings for unlawful presence made a DACA\n22 recipient an “enforcement priority” rather than a “low priority case” in the absence\n23 of a “disqualifying criminal offense” or public safety concern.\n24 135. Through his counsel, Mr. Gonzalez responded to the NOIT by\n25 explaining that he continues to meet all of the objective DACA eligibility\n26 criteria—including Defendants’ determination that he does not pose a threat to\n27 national security or public safety—which have governed USCIS’s DACA\n28\n29\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.926   Page 31 of 46\n1 determinations for over five years, and formed the basis for his two previous\n2 DACA grants.\n3 136. The response went on to explain that ICE’s litigation of removal\n4 proceedings for unlawful presence against a DACA recipient was not a valid basis\n5 for USCIS to terminate DACA under the SOP, which requires USCIS to consider\n6 eligibility for individuals in removal proceedings and with final orders of removal.\n7 In short, he explained that “since DACA’s inception, the litigation of removal\n8 proceedings by ICE has never been a bar to USCIS’s adjudication and approval of\n9 DACA,” and that termination on that basis would therefore violate the APA.\n10 “Consistent with these policies and practices, Mr. Gonzalez respectfully\n11 request[ed] that USCIS exercise its independent discretion in this case and\n12 continue its deferral of [his] removal.”\n13 137. While the NOIT did not give any factual predicate or cite any reversal\n14 in policy or guidance in support of the notion that Mr. Gonzalez is now an\n15 “enforcement priority,” Mr. Gonzalez’s response posited that the only conceivable\n16 basis for such an assertion was his May 6, 2016 arrest, which never led to the filing\n17 of any criminal charges in Immigration Court, Federal Court, or State Court.\n18 138. In unambiguously denying any knowledge of or involvement in any\n19 alleged criminal conduct surrounding the circumstances of that day, the response\n20 was unequivocal:\n21 “Mr. Gonzalez takes this opportunity to reassert his\n22 ignorance of and lack of participation in any alleged\n23 criminal conduct, including alien harboring. He was at\n24 the house on May 6 to look after the pets of an\n25 acquaintance and had nothing to do with any of the\n26 alleged undocumented immigrants that CBP allegedly\n27 encountered. It is crucial to note that even in CBP’s\n28 version of the events, recounted in the I-213 issued the\n30\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.927   Page 32 of 46\n1 day after the arrest, Mr. Gonzalez was outside of the\n2 house when the individuals were discovered and was not\n3 questioned about their presence prior to their discovery.\n4 And the officers arrested and took him away before any\n5 of those individuals emerged from the house. Once the\n6 questioning began at the detention facility, it became\n7 clear that Mr. Gonzalez had no idea what the officers\n8 were talking about.”\n9 139. Mr. Gonzalez’s response also referenced and attached the sworn\n10 declaration he submitted to this Court under penalty of perjury, in which he\n11 explained (1) his expectation that the officers would let him leave the house and go\n12 to work because he had not “committed a crime,” and (2) the fact that the CBP\n13 officers indicated their intent to detain him before discovering any alleged\n14 criminality on the stated rationale that he “was not in the country legally and [his]\n15 DACA status did not matter.”\n16 140. Mr. Gonzalez pointed out the arbitrariness of his sudden purported\n17 “enforcement priority” label, given: (1) CBP’s abandonment of his case after two\n18 days of questioning and a thorough search of his cell phone; (2) Judge\n19 McSeveney’s determination that he was credible and should be released on bond\n20 because he was not a public safety concern; (3) DHS’s decision not to object to or\n21 appeal that determination; and (4) the fact that he has not had an encounter with or\n22 been questioned by law enforcement for over a year and a half after his release\n23 (and never had a single law enforcement encounter before May 6, 2016).\n24 141. Indeed, Mr. Gonzalez made clear that deeming him an “enforcement\n25 priority” would be counter to (or an unexplained reversal of) Defendants’ years-\n26 long policy of categorizing individuals who meet the DACA eligibility criteria as\n27 “low priority cases” in the absence of “disqualifying criminal offenses.”\n28\n31\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.928   Page 33 of 46\n1 142. And of course, Defendants explained in a filing with this Court as\n2 recently as December 8, 2017 that they “do not take issue with [Mr. Gonzalez’s]\n3 ability to meet the DACA guidelines going forward.” Those guidelines include the\n4 requirement that Mr. Gonzalez has not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal\n5 offense and does not “otherwise pose[] a threat to national security or public\n6 safety.”\n7 143. USCIS permitted Mr. Gonzalez to submit a supplemental response as\n8 well, in order to address the new NTA that ICE issued on December 8, 2017,\n9 which Mr. Gonzalez did not receive until the day before he submitted his initial\n10 response. The new NTA again only charges unlawful presence in the United\n11 States, which “does not provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA.” Inland\n12 Empire—Immigrant Youth Collective v. Duke, 2017 WL 5900061, at *6 (C.D. Cal.\n13 Nov. 20, 2017).\n14 144. Within two or three days of receiving these responses (and just one\n15 day before Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status was set to expire) USCIS issued Mr.\n16 Gonzalez’s Termination Notice on December 21, 2017. On the sole basis of that\n17 termination decision, USCIS summarily denied Mr. Gonzalez’s renewal\n18 application on December 28, 2017.\n19 145. Signaling that the decision was pre-determined, USCIS explained that\n20 it based its decision on ICE’s issuance of the December 8, 2017 NTA.\n21 146. Even though neither NTA against Mr. Gonzalez has contained any\n22 criminal allegations, the Termination Notice went on to explain USCIS’s informal\n23 determination that Mr. Gonzalez is a criminal because his “claim that [he was]\n24 unaware of [the alleged undocumented immigrants’] presence in the home is not\n25 credible when [he was] present in the house and three individuals did identify\n26 [him] in connection with their smuggling.”\n27 147. Of course, nine out of the twelve individuals interviewed did not\n28 identify Mr. Gonzalez.\n32\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.929   Page 34 of 46\n1 148. More importantly, Mr. Gonzalez has never had an opportunity to\n2 confront the circumstances of those three identifications, let alone cross-examine\n3 those individuals or the nine individuals who did not identify him, all of whose\n4 identities are redacted in the I-831 and who were all placed into removal\n5 proceedings and likely have been removed from the country.\n6 149. Indeed, Mr. Gonzalez has never had an opportunity to confront any of\n7 the suspicions against him in a proper forum, for the simple reason that he has\n8 never been charged with a crime in any forum. That is unsurprising, given his\n9 repeated claims of innocence and the fact that the law enforcement agencies tasked\n10 with investigating the incident seem to have concluded long ago that he was not\n11 involved in any alleged criminal act.\n12 150. The I-831 indicates that the other suspected caretaker of the house\n13 (whose name is redacted but was presumably “Romeo”) was read his Miranda\n14 rights. There is no indication that Mr. Gonzalez was read his Miranda rights\n15 before being questioned, again indicating that the officers did not view him as a\n16 serious target of the criminal investigation (or that the officers violated his\n17 Constitutional rights).\n18 151. Mr. Gonzalez now faces the revocation of his DACA status and the\n19 summary denial of his renewal application—i.e., the significant benefits of being\n20 permitted to live and work lawfully in the United States—even though he has\n21 never been convicted of (or even charged with) a disqualifying criminal offense (or\n22 any criminal offense), in a clear misapplication of Defendants’ own enforcement\n23 priority policies and after a USCIS agent’s informal determination of criminality.\n24 152. In addition to violating the DACA program rules, Defendants’ process\n25 clearly lacks the fairness and reliability required to deprive a person of existing\n26 liberty or property interests. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).\n27 153. The value of additional procedural safeguards is significant. And\n28 those safeguards are readily available to Defendants. Even if Defendants wish to\n33\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.930   Page 35 of 46\n1 adjudicate allegations against Mr. Gonzalez and base DACA termination on an\n2 administrative finding rather than on a criminal conviction, an obvious available\n3 alternative exists: the filing of an NTA charging more than mere unlawful presence\n4 and the determination by an Immigration Judge of the charge’s validity.\n5 CAUSES OF ACTION\n6 COUNT ONE\n7 Administrative Procedure Act\n8 (Initial May 23, 2016 Automatic Termination)\n9 154. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n10 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n11 155. The termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment\n12 authorization and summary denial of his renewal application constitute final\n13 agency action that cannot be appealed administratively.\n14 156. The APA provides that courts “shall hold unlawful and set aside\n15 agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse\n16 of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n17 157. Agencies must provide “reasoned explanation[s]” for their actions,\n18 and courts must reverse agency actions for which they cannot discern a reason.\n19 Defendants provided no explanation—let alone a reasoned one—for the automatic\n20 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD in violation of multiple\n21 provisions of the DACA SOP and USCIS Memo, which establish the binding\n22 process for DACA termination.\n23 158. The DACA SOP and USCIS Memo typically require USCIS to issue a\n24 DACA beneficiary an NOIT and 33 days to respond before determining whether to\n25 terminate DACA status. But USCIS did not provide Mr. Gonzalez with notice or\n26 an opportunity to respond before terminating his DACA status. The SOP provides\n27 for termination without notice when USCIS follows the protocol for EPS cases,\n28 including referral of the case to BCU and ultimately to ICE and the issuance of an\n34\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.931   Page 36 of 46\n1 NTA by ICE based on alleged EPS concerns. But USCIS did not follow the\n2 protocol for EPS cases, nor did ICE issue Mr. Gonzalez an NTA based on a finding\n3 that his was an EPS case. Neither the DACA SOP nor the USCIS Memo provides\n4 for “automatic” termination without notice when CBP issues an NTA based on\n5 unlawful presence. But USCIS terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status\n6 automatically upon CBP’s issuance of an NTA that listed unlawful presence as its\n7 sole basis. Moreover, USCIS’s own guidelines make clear that, even upon ICE’s\n8 issuance of an NTA in an EPS case, USCIS should proceed by “taking into account\n9 the basis for the NTA.” USCIS Memo at 4. By adopting an unwritten “policy” of\n10 automatic termination regardless of the basis for an NTA and regardless of the\n11 issuing agency, USCIS expressly eschewed any consideration of the basis for the\n12 NTA.\n13 159. In at least these ways, USCIS’s initial automatic termination of Mr.\n14 Gonzalez’s DACA status in May 2016 violated established procedures for DACA\n15 termination and, for that reason, was arbitrary and capricious.\n16 160. USCIS’s initial automatic termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n17 status was also arbitrary and capricious because USCIS failed to exercise its\n18 discretion through reasoned decision-making and merely terminated his status\n19 “automatically” based on a CBP officer’s decision to issue an NTA for unlawful\n20 presence, which is not even a relevant factor in the determination of DACA\n21 eligibility.\n22 161. The termination decision was also arbitrary and capricious because:\n23 (a) USCIS failed to articulate any reason for terminating DACA benefits; (b)\n24 DACA status is expressly available to those who are subject to NTAs and thus\n25 cannot terminate automatically upon the issuance of an NTA; (c) it purports to rest\n26 on a practice that finds no support in procedures that govern DACA termination\n27 and constitutes an abrupt departure from established termination practice; (d) it\n28 would make termination hinge on an immigration official’s decision to issue an\n35\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.932   Page 37 of 46\n1 NTA without any allegation of wrongdoing; and (e) “automatic” termination does\n2 not involve the exercise of discretion, which is required before USCIS may\n3 terminate DACA status.\n4 162. The harms flowing from Defendants’ unlawful May 2016 termination\n5 have not abated.\n6 163. For all of these reasons, USCIS’s initial automatic termination of Mr.\n7 Gonzalez’s DACA status and work authorization in May 2016 violates the APA\n8 and must be permanently vacated and enjoined as arbitrary, capricious, and an\n9 abuse of discretion.\n10 COUNT TWO\n11 Administrative Procedure Act\n12 (Purported December 21, 2017 Termination and Purported December 28,\n13 2017 Denial)\n14 164. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n15 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n16 165. The termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment\n17 authorization and summary denial of his renewal application constitute final\n18 agency action that cannot be appealed administratively.\n19 166. The APA provides that courts “shall hold unlawful and set aside\n20 agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse\n21 of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n22 167. Agencies must provide “reasoned explanation[s]” for their actions,\n23 and courts must reverse agency actions for which they cannot discern a reason.\n24 When an agency departs from prior action, it must provide “a reasoned analysis for\n25 the change.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The DACA SOP identifies six permissible bases for DACA\n4 termination. Defendants assert that USCIS premised its termination of Mr.\n5 Gonzalez’s DACA status on only one of those six bases—that it was “not\n6 consistent with [DHS’s] enforcement priorities.” But Mr. Gonzalez does not fit\n7 DHS’s own well-defined enforcement priorities with respect to DACA recipients\n8 because he satisfies the DACA eligibility criteria and has not either been convicted\n9 or otherwise adjudicated guilty of a disqualifying criminal offense and Defendants\n10 do not assert that he is either a public safety or a national security concern.\n11 169. To the extent that Defendants purport to rely on the Kelly Memo’s\n12 definitions of enforcement priorities for non-DACA recipients to revoke Mr.\n13 Gonzalez’s DACA status, they are violating its explicit and binding terms. The\n14 Kelly Memo exempts DACA recipients from enforcement priority status for\n15 merely having “been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved”\n16 or a suspicion of having “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal\n17 offense.” Only individuals who do not qualify for DACA status may be\n18 considered enforcement priorities on those bases. Asserting that a DACA recipient\n19 who is subject to only an allegation or suspicion of criminal misconduct, without a\n20 conviction or adverse adjudication in court, violates Defendants’ own binding\n21 policies with respect to enforcement priorities and the APA.\n22 170. To the extent that Defendants purport to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n23 DACA status under their governing DACA Memo and DACA SOP provisions,\n24 they are either deliberately disregarding or grossly misreading those provisions. In\n25 the absence of a disqualifying criminal offense or public safety concern, the DACA\n26 Memo, DACA SOP, DACA FAQ, and other guidance governing administration of\n27 the DACA program do not make Mr. Gonzalez an enforcement priority or allow\n28 Defendants to terminate his DACA status on the basis of a suspicion of criminal\n37\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.934   Page 39 of 46\n1 conduct reviewed by a USCIS officer nearly two years after the fact, in the face of\n2 a bare-bones NOIT that did not indicate what facts would inform its review, and in\n3 the face of an Immigration Judge’s determination that Mr. Gonzalez was credible\n4 and did not present a public safety concern, and Defendants’ agreement that Mr.\n5 Gonzalez continues to meet the DACA criteria—including the lack of a\n6 disqualifying criminal offense or public safety concern. Defendants therefore have\n7 also violated the APA by terminating Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status without any\n8 proper basis in the DACA SOP and/or improperly attempted to adopt bases for\n9 termination that do not appear in the DACA SOP informally and sub silentio,\n10 which also violates the APA.\n11 171. USCIS’s purported termination decision constitutes an unexplained\n12 departure from established DACA determination policies and practices. It also\n13 purports to permit termination to hinge on an immigration official’s decision to\n14 issue an NTA for mere unlawful presence, a charge that is irrelevant to DACA\n15 eligibility.\n16 172. And because USCIS’s purported summary denial of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n17 DACA renewal application is for the sole reason of the unlawful termination\n18 (which has yet to even take effect), it has no basis in reasoned decision-making or\n19 consideration of relevant factors.\n20 173. In at least these ways, USCIS’s termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n21 status and summary denial of his renewal application violate established\n22 procedures and policies for DACA status determinations and are arbitrary,\n23 capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the APA.\n24 COUNT THREE\n25 Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\n26 1. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n27 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n28\n38\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.935   Page 40 of 46\n1 2. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o\n2 person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\n3 law.”\n4 3. Immigrants who are physically present in the United States are\n5 guaranteed the protections of the Due Process Clause. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533\n6 U.S. 678, 693 (2001); U.S. v. Peralta-Sanchez, 847 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir.\n7 2017) (“[T]he Due Process Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United States,\n8 including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or\n9 permanent.”).\n10 4. When a person has a protected liberty or property interest, the\n11 Constitution constrains government action that deprives the person of that interest\n12 without due process. See Nozzi v. Housing Authority of LA, 806 F.3d 1178, 1190-\n13 91 (9th Cir. 2015); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).\n14 5. DACA status confers a liberty interest to be free from apprehension,\n15 arrest, or detention on the basis of immigration status. The term liberty also\n16 encompasses the ability to work, raise a family, and “form the other enduring\n17 attachments of normal life.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972).\n18 Where, as here, an individual reasonably relies on a conferred status to pursue\n19 these activities, that status cannot be revoked without due process. See Bell v.\n20 Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971).\n21 6. DACA status also confers property interests, which “extend beyond\n22 tangible property and include anything to which a plaintiff has a legitimate claim\n23 of entitlement . . . [as] created [by] . . . rules or understandings that secure certain\n24 benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” Nozzi, 806 F.3d\n25 at 1191.\n26 7. Mr. Gonzalez possesses a property interest in his DACA status and\n27 the numerous benefits conferred by it, including employment authorization and\n28 eligibility for federal and state public benefits.\n39\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.936   Page 41 of 46\n1 8. While Defendants may argue that DACA status confers no substantive\n2 rights or benefits, “the identification of property interests under constitutional law\n3 turns on the substance of the interest recognized, not the name given that interest\n4 by the state.” Newman v. Sathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d 786, 797 (9th Cir. 2002).\n5 The “mutually explicit understandings” created by Defendants’ establishment and\n6 continuous operation of the DACA program—under a well-defined framework and\n7 highly specific criteria—created a reasonable expectation of entitlement to DACA\n8 status and its attendant benefits, and proper consideration for renewal, which\n9 cannot be terminated without due process. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593,\n10 601 (1972).\n11 9. Even if Defendants’ ultimate decision about whether to terminate Mr.\n12 Gonzalez’s DACA status is discretionary, its policy and process must be rational\n13 and conform to their own policies and Constitutional procedural due process\n14 requirements. See Galvin v. Hay, 374 F.3d 739, 758 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[F]ederal\n15 officials do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights.”).\n16 10. The adequacy of Defendants’ procedure in attempting to deprive Mr.\n17 Gonzalez of his protected liberty and property interests is evaluated under the\n18 three-part Eldridge test, under which the Court must balance (1) the nature of the\n19 interest and the degree of potential deprivation, (2) the fairness and reliability of\n20 existing procedures and the value of additional procedural safeguards, and (3) the\n21 public interest.\n22 11. Here, the initial automatic termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n23 status, EAD, and other benefits on May 23, 2016 without any notice or opportunity\n24 to be heard obviously fails the Eldridge test. First, his protected interests are\n25 extremely significant. Second, the existing procedure of termination without\n26 notice is a wholly inadequate abrogation of the “essence of due process”—\n27 adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to present one’s case. Eldridge, 424\n28\n40\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.937   Page 42 of 46\n1 U.S. at 348-49. And third, there is no credible burden associated with adequate\n2 procedural safeguards, or public benefit from their absence.\n3 12. Similarly, Defendants’ purported December 21, 2017 termination and\n4 December 28, 2017 summary denial of renewal of Mr. Gonzalez’s right to live and\n5 work lawfully in the United States fail the Eldridge test. First, his protected\n6 interests—the rights that Defendants conferred on him to live and work in the only\n7 country he knows after he submitted to extensive screening and paid substantial\n8 fees—are extremely significant. Second, the existing procedure of a criminal\n9 determination through the informal NOIT process—via a USCIS agent’s\n10 determinations of credibility and criminality without a hearing or the ability to\n11 confront evidence—is neither fair nor reliable. And the value of a simple\n12 additional procedural safeguard—i.e., the issuance of an NTA charging a crime,\n13 and an Immigration Judge’s sustaining of that NTA—is tremendous. Third, the\n14 public interest and the rights implicated by these determinations heavily outweigh\n15 the additional burden of using fair and Constitutionally adequate procedures to\n16 adjudicate criminal allegations or suspicions.\n17 13. Mr. Gonzalez does not have any DACA-disqualifying criminal\n18 offenses. Even if Defendants wish to adjudicate criminal allegations against Mr.\n19 Gonzalez only through an administrative proceeding (rather than in a Federal Court\n20 prosecution) and to revoke the rights they granted him to live and work lawfully in\n21 the United States, they have an administrative avenue for doing so: via the issuance\n22 of an NTA alleging a criminal violation as the basis for removal. In the face of\n23 such an obvious alternative procedure, the revocation of benefits with serious\n24 adverse liberty and property consequences through a USCIS agent’s informal\n25 findings of credibility and criminality fails the Eldridge test and is Constitutionally\n26 inadequate.\n27 14. Because an informal determination of criminality with serious\n28 consequences is anathema to our “concept of ordered liberty,” and because\n41\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.938   Page 43 of 46\n1 removal from the country in the absence of any culpability would visit such\n2 grievous harm, Defendants’ actions “shock the conscience” and also amount to a\n3 violation of Mr. Gonzalez’s substantive due process rights. Cnty. of Sacramento v.\n4 Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 (1998).\n5 15. For all of these reasons, Defendants’ termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n6 DACA status and employment authorization and summary denial of his renewal\n7 application violate his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n8 Amendment.\n9 COUNT FOUR\n10 Declaratory Relief\n11 16. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n12 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n13 17. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that Defendants’ May 23, 2016\n14 automatic termination of his DACA status and EAD failed to adhere to the DACA\n15 SOP and USCIS Memo, was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and\n16 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n17 18. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that Defendants’ December 21,\n18 2017 termination of his DACA status and employment authorization and\n19 December 28, 2017 summary denial of his renewal application fail to adhere to\n20 Defendants’ policies, including the DACA Memo, DACA SOP, DACA FAQ,\n21 Kelly Memo, and related guidance, and are arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of\n22 discretion.\n23 19. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that (1) he has constitutionally\n24 protected liberty and property interests in his DACA status and its attendant\n25 benefits, and therefore (2) Defendants’ termination of those interests through an\n26 informal determination of criminality does not provide the procedural safeguards\n27 mandated by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n28\n42\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.939   Page 44 of 46\n1 20. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that, for all of these reasons,\n2 Defendants’ termination of his DACA status and employment authorization, and\n3 summary denial of his renewal application, violate the APA and the Due Process\n4 Clause of the Fifth Amendment and must be set aside.\n5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n6 WHEREFORE, Mr. Gonzalez prays that this Court grant the following\n7 relief:\n8 (1) Declare that Defendants’ May 2016 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n9 DACA status, EAD, and attendant benefits (i) is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse\n10 of discretion in violation of the APA; (ii) violates Mr. Gonzalez’s rights under the\n11 Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (iii) as a result, must be set\n12 aside;\n13 (2) Declare that Defendants’ December 2017 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n14 DACA status, EAD, and attendant benefits and summary denial of his renewal\n15 application (i) are arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of\n16 the APA; (ii) violate Mr. Gonzalez’s rights under the Due Process Clause of the\n17 Fifth Amendment; and (iii) as a result, must be set aside;\n18 (3) Declare (i) that Mr. Gonzalez has constitutionally protected liberty and\n19 property interests in his DACA status, EAD, and attendant benefits, and (ii) that\n20 Defendants’ purported termination of those interests in both May 2016 and\n21 December 2017 was unlawful and invalid;\n22 (4) Declare that a denial of Mr. Gonzalez’s renewal application on the same\n23 grounds as the December 2017 termination decision violates the APA and the Due\n24 Process Clause;\n25 (5) Set aside and enjoin Defendants’ decisions to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n26 DACA status and EAD in both May 2016 and December 2017 and their summary\n27 denial of his renewal application in December 2017;\n28\n43\nFIRSTAMENDEDCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 38   Filed 01/12/18   PageID.940   Page 45 of 46\n1 (6) Order Defendants to restore Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD\n2 pending a termination procedure that comports with the APA and the Due Process\n3 Clause and a lawful resolution of his renewal application;\n4 (7) Award Mr. Gonzalez reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees; and\n5 (8) Grant any other and further relief that this Court deems fit and proper.\n6\n7 Dated: January 12, 2018 Respectfully submitted,\n8\n/s/ John C.

INTRODUCTION \n1\nDefendants seek to foreclose any judicial review of Mr. Gonzalez’s APA and \n2\nconstitutional claims by asking this Court to reconsider its jurisdictional determinations. \n3\nOn the merits, Defendants seek to convert the term “enforcement priorities,” which is \n4\nclearly defined in DACA’s governing documents, into a standardless phrase that would \n5\nallow them to terminate benefits whenever they feel like it. The Court should reject this \n6\nunsupportable misreading of their governing procedures. And if Defendants are \n7\ncharacterizing their policies correctly, they have applied them in a way that violates Mr. \n8\nGonzalez’s right to due process. \n9\nII.  THIS COURT’S JURISDICTIONAL RULINGS ARE LAW OF THE \nCASE; DEFENDANTS IMPROPERLY SEEK RECONSIDERATION \n10\nThis Court correctly determined that neither 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) nor 8 U.S.C. § \n11\n1252(b)(9) deprives it of jurisdiction over claims that Defendants violated their own \n12\nmandatory policies and procedures, the APA, and the Constitution in purporting to \n13\nterminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status through a process that—as the Court noted and \n14\nDefendants conceded—is not subject to review in immigration court. Dkt. 12 at 8-9 \n15\n(docket pagination throughout); Sept. 28, 2017 Hr’g Tr. at 16. Every court to address \n16\nthe issue has reached the same conclusion. See IEIYC v. Duke, 2017 WL 5900061 \n17\n(C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017); Ramirez Medina v. DHS, 2017 WL 5176720 (W.D. Wash. \n18\nNov. 8, 2017); Coyotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328 (N.D. Ga. 2017). But Defendants \n19\nrehash the same losing arguments rejected by the Ninth Circuit, which has held that a \n20\nfederal court has jurisdiction to “consider a purely legal question that does not challenge \n21\nthe Attorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the answer … forms the \n22\nbackdrop against which the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary \n23\nauthority.” U.S. v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004). Defendants’ \n24\narguments fail—again. \n25\nFirst, this Court’s decisions regarding the effects of Sections 1252(g) and \n26\n1252(b)(9) are law of the case, which “requires that when a court decides on a rule, it \n27\nshould ordinarily follow that rule during the pendency of the matter” in the absence—as \n28\nhere—of “a change in controlling authority or the need to correct a clearly erroneous \n  1 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1285   Page 7 of 17\n \n1 decision which would work a manifest injustice.” Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136 F. \n2 Supp. 2d 1152, 1153-54 (E.D. Cal. 2001). While the Court’s order was preliminary, \n3 neither the law nor anything relevant to the Court’s jurisdictional determinations has \n4 changed. See id. (prior preliminary injunction established law of the case). Mr. \n5 Gonzalez is still not challenging any of the “narrow[]” and “discrete actions” in Section \n6 1252(g), Dkt. 12 at 8; and he is still not “seeking judicial review of [an] order[] of \n7 removal,” id. at 9. He is again asserting that Defendants have violated their mandatory \n8 DACA procedures, and his claims still do not bear on the validity of his NTA or \n9 challenge his immigration court removal proceedings.1 There is no reason to disturb \n10 this Court’s decision.2 \n11 Second, Defendants inappropriately seek reconsideration of the Court’s rulings. \n12 See Dkt. 44 at 16, 17, 22 n.5 (“Defendants disagree”; “prior reliance … is also \n13 misplaced”; “previous reliance … is misplaced”). Too late. See L.R. 7.1.i.2 (“any \n14 motion or application for reconsideration must be filed within 28 days after the entry of \n15 the ruling, order or judgment sought to be reconsidered”). In this Court, reconsideration \n16 is “disfavored unless a party shows there is new evidence, a change in controlling law, \n17 or establishes that the Court committed a clear error in the earlier ruling.” Nothing of \n18 the sort has happened. \n19 Third, regardless of the above, Defendants are wrong. On Section 1252(g), \n20 Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1155, controls. There, “the only thing standing between [the \n21 plaintiff] and deportation [was] the district court’s order barring the INS from \n22 commencing deportation proceedings” on particular grounds. Id. Because he sought “a \n23 description of the relevant law” (applied to his criminal convictions) that would “form[] \n                                         \n24 1 An Immigration Judge’s past or future discretionary decision to terminate or close \nMr. Gonzalez’s immigration court removal proceedings after being apprised of his \n25 situation does not change the fact that his claims in this Court are entirely collateral to \nand independent of the removal proceedings. Indeed, a claim may be independent of \n26 removal proceedings even when its resolution might invalidate the proceedings. See \nFlores-Torres v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 708, 711-13 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2008). \n27 2 These principles are particularly apt given Defendants’ decision not to appeal the \nCourt’s legal determinations. See Schering Corp. v. Ill. Antibiotics Co., 89 F.3d 357, \n28\n358 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Under the doctrine of the law of the case, a ruling by the trial \ncourt, in an earlier stage of the case, that could have been but was not challenged on \nappeal is binding in subsequent stages of the case.”). \n  2 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1286   Page 8 of 17\n \n1 the backdrop against which the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary \n2 authority,” the district court had jurisdiction—even though he sought an injunction \n3 against the very commencement of removal proceedings. Id. Mr. Gonzalez is not \n4 asking this Court to undo his NTA. He is asking the Court to (1) “consider a purely \n5 legal question” (how does the DACA program define “enforcement priorities” for \n6 termination purposes?) (2) “that does not challenge … discretionary authority” (to \n7 commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders). And “even if the \n8 answer … forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later will exercise \n9 discretionary authority” (whether a person in Mr. Gonzalez’s situation fits the \n10 definition), this Court has jurisdiction. \n11 Sissoko v. Rocha, 509 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 2007) confirms that Mr. Gonzalez’s \n12 claims are properly before this Court. There, the Ninth Circuit held that Section 1252(g) \n13 barred jurisdiction in the “limited context” of a challenge to detention that was \n14 statutorily “mandatory” upon the commencement of expedited removal proceedings, \n15 and therefore “arose from” that commencement. By contrast, it is not “mandatory” that \n16 the commencement of removal proceedings for unlawful presence terminates DACA \n17 status, so Mr. Gonzalez’s challenge to Defendants’ actions does not “arise from” that \n18 commencement. See Dkt. 12 at 11. \n19 Defendants’ reliance on Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir. 2001) is \n20 also misplaced. On a petition for review, the Ninth Circuit simply explained that the \n21 petitioner had not alleged a “colorable” due process claim because he did “not contend \n22 that he was prevented from presenting his case before the immigration judge or the \n23 BIA, denied a full and fair hearing before an impartial adjudicator[,] or otherwise \n24 denied a basic due process right.” Id. at 1271. Mr. Gonzalez has alleged all of these, and \n25 made clear that he is not challenging any of the three discrete actions in Section \n26 1252(g). See Dkt. 39-1 at 29-34. \n27 This Court should again quickly dispose of Defendants’ reliance on Sections \n28 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9). The “explicit language” of those provisions “appl[ies] only \nto those claims seeking judicial review of orders of removal.” A. Singh v. Gonzalez, 499 \n  3 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1287   Page 9 of 17\n \n1 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007). They do not apply to “claims that are collateral to, or \n2 independent of, the removal process.” JEFM v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 (9th Cir. \n3 2016). Mr. Gonzalez is not challenging any part of the immigration court process. His \n4 claims are not “bound up in and an inextricable part of the [immigration court] \n5 administrative process.” Id. at 1033; Aguilar v. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) \n6 (“arises from” requires tighter nexus than “related to”). \n7 Finally, this Court must not abandon its role and construe the INA “to deny any \n8 judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim,” raising “serious constitutional \n9 concerns.” Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988); cf. JEFM, 837 F.3d at 1035 \n10 (Plaintiffs “have not been denied all forms of meaningful judicial review.”). \nIII.  THE APA DOES NOT PRECLUDE REVIEW \n11\nDefendants’ assertion that 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) precludes review of Mr. \n12\nGonzalez’s claims is an equally unavailing effort to circumvent the “strong \n13\npresumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action.” INS v. St. Cyr, 533 \n14\nU.S. 289, 298 (2001). Section 701(a)(2) only precludes judicial review “to the extent \n15\nthat” a particular “action is committed to agency discretion by law.” It is a “very narrow \n16\nexception” that “applies in those rare instances where … in a given case there is no law \n17\nto apply.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971); \n18\nRobbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“absolutely no guidance as to \n19\nhow [] discretion is to be exercised”). This Court already disposed of Defendants’ \n20\narguments by making clear that the DACA SOP provides law for Defendants to apply \n21\nand “categorically reject[ing]” that “DHS possesses such broad prosecutorial discretion \n22\nthat they need not follow the DACA SOP in terminating the status of DACA \n23\nrecipients.” Dkt. 12 at 10. \n24\nLaw to apply may be found in “internal operating procedures,” “policy \n25\nstatement[s],” and “usual practice.” Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. \n26\n2004).3 Defendants cannot seriously contend—in the face of mounting judicial \n27\ndeterminations and their own admissions—that the DACA Memo, DACA SOP, \n28\n                                         \n3 Indeed, “DHS’s prior statements” regarding the operation of DACA provide law to \napply. Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 2017 WL 5201116, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2017). \n  4 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1288   Page 10 of 17\n \n1 DACA FAQ, and other DHS statements, memos, and policy directives do not provide \n2 law to apply with respect to DACA status decisions and enforcement priority \n3 determinations. Even if Defendants had unfettered discretion over similar decisions \n4 before DACA, their establishment of and adherence to binding procedures, definitions, \n5 and restrictions brings their compliance squarely within the purview of 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n6 INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996) (“Though the agency’s discretion is unfettered at \n7 the outset, if it announces and follows—by rule or by settled course of adjudication—a \n8 general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed, an irrational \n9 departure from that policy (as opposed to an avowed alteration of it) could constitute \n10 action that must be overturned” under the APA.). In addition, it is “well-established that \n11 even where agency action is committed to agency discretion by law, review is still \n12 available to determine if the Constitution has been violated.” Batalla Vidal, 2017 WL \n13 5201116, at *11. \n14 Against this backdrop, Defendants attempt to reframe Mr. Gonzalez’s claims as \n15 a challenge to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion—i.e., to ICE’s decision to issue \n16 an NTA for unlawful presence, which Mr. Gonzalez is not challenging here —rather \n17 than to their termination of his DACA status in violation of the DACA SOP. \n18 Defendants’ cases regarding challenges to discretionary decisions not to enforce are \n19 inapposite and shed no light on whether the DACA program is bereft of “judicially \n20 manageable standards” to judge Defendants’ compliance with their own mandatory \n21 policies and defined enforcement priorities when they decided to enforce the \n22 termination provisions against Mr. Gonzalez. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 \n23 (1985). In Heckler, the Supreme Court explained that enforcement decisions are \n24 reviewable when governed by “clearly defined factors.” Id. at 834. Regardless of the \n25 extent of Defendants’ discretion to issue an NTA for unlawful presence to a DACA \n26\n27\n28\n  5 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1289   Page 11 of 17\n \n1 recipient, DACA termination is governed by clearly defined factors in the DACA \n2 Memo and SOP.4 And Defendants’ invocation of a “complex balancing of policy \n3 considerations,” Dkt. 44 at 23, is a red herring. Nothing about reading the DACA \n4 SOP’s and the Kelly Memo’s definitions of who does and does not constitute an \n5 enforcement priority is “peculiarly within [USCIS’s] expertise.” Heckler, 470 U.S. at \n6 831. Indeed, if the phrase “enforcement priorities” is as standardless as Defendants \n7 claim, no balancing of anything would be required before stripping a DACA recipient \n8 of his status. That cannot be the law. \n9 Finally, Defendants’ attempt to equate the DACA SOP with the 1981 deferred \n10 action instructions at issue in Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021 (9th Cir. 1985) \n11 ignores two dispositive distinctions. First, like the 1978 version at issue in Nicholas v. \n12 INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979), DACA status confers substantive benefits and is \n13 premised on humanitarian concerns: \n \n14 •  Defendants have taken affirmative steps and expended significant resources to, e.g., \n(1) conduct an “ongoing review of pending removal cases [and] offer[] \n15 administrative closure to many of them,” Dkt. 39-4 at 2; (2) operate a special hotline \n“staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week” to assist DACA-eligible individuals in \n16 removal proceedings, id. at 10; and (3) establish the comprehensive SOP to greatly \ncircumscribe discretion regarding DACA status. \n17 •  The DACA Memo opens by explaining that DHS intends to protect “certain young \npeople who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \n18 home,” and “lacked the intent to violate the law.” Dkt. 39-4 at 2. \n19 Second, as Defendants have conceded, the DACA Memo and SOP are replete \n20 with mandatory language. See, e.g., id. at 2-3 (“necessary to ensure” non-prioritization; \n21 “USCIS is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days”; “USCIS \n22 process shall also be available to individuals subject to a final order of removal”). \n23 Hence, the DACA SOP’s objectively verifiable criteria have been the determinative \n24 basis for USCIS’s DACA decisions since its inception. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, \n25 171 (5th Cir. 2015). The DACA program provides ample law to apply, and Defendants’ \n26                                          \n4 Therefore, Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822 (9th Cir. 2016) has no \n27 application here. To secure the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the \nplaintiff was challenging a valid reinstatement of removal issued in immigration \n28\ncourt, and her claims were entirely bound up in what was happening in her removal \nproceedings. Id. at 825. By contrast, Mr. Gonzalez is not challenging any agency’s \ndecision to issue an NTA or prosecute that NTA in immigration court. \n  6 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1290   Page 12 of 17\n \n1 efforts to deprive it of meaning by asserting the right to terminate DACA whenever and \n2 however they please are contrary to law and logic. \nIV.  DEFENDANTS IGNORED THE DACA MEMO’S AND DACA SOP’S \n3 DEFINITIONS OF ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES \n4 Defendants’ arguments on the merits hinge on erroneous assertions and post hoc \n5 rationalizations: (1) that Mr. Gonzalez has not identified how the DACA SOP defines \n6 “enforcement priorities” for DACA recipients, Dkt. 44 at 27-28; (2) that “the DACA \n7 SOP is silent as to the factors USCIS is to use in DACA termination decisions based \n8 where an individual is determined to be an enforcement priority,” Dkt. 44 at 29 n.10; \n9 (3) that the law and the DACA program permit Defendants’ unfettered discretion to \n10 deem a DACA recipient an enforcement priority for any reason, and USCIS is not \n11 “constrained by his lack of conviction o[r] public safety concern,” Dkt. 44 at 305; and \n12 (4) that Mr. Gonzalez must be an enforcement priority “based on his alleged role in an \n13 alien smuggling enterprise” because the 2011 USCIS Memo (Dkt. 39-4, Ex. H) \n14 identifies circumstances where ICE may find a DACA recipient an Egregious Public \n15 Safety (“EPS”) concern, Dkt. 44 at 28. \n16 As Mr. Gonzalez already explained—no matter the definition of enforcement \n17 priorities that may apply to individuals outside the scope of the DACA Memo, or \n18 perhaps even facially-DACA-eligible individuals who do not have DACA status—\n19 pursuant to the DACA SOP, a DACA recipient is, by definition, a “low priority” \n20 individual as long as he continues to meet the objectively verifiable DACA criteria. In \n21 other words, DACA status, once granted, cannot be terminated without a disqualifying \n22 criminal conviction, a public safety concern finding, a national security concern finding, \n23 or an EPS finding. The DACA SOP is not silent regarding what is required for a \n24 DACA recipient to be deemed an enforcement priority. Rather, it speaks simply and \n25 clearly: “these” individuals (i.e., who meet the DACA criteria) are distinct from “those \n26 who meet  \n27                                          \n5 Defendants admit, as they did in his purported termination notice, that Mr. Gonzalez \n28\ndoes not have a criminal offense and is not a public safety concern or an EPS \nconcern. Their effort to terminate his DACA status is not based on “relevant factors,” \nbut a failure to exercise “reasoned decisionmaking.” Judulang, 565 U.S. at 52-53, 55. \n  7 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1291   Page 13 of 17\n \n1 DHS’s enforcement priorities.” Apr. 4, 2013 DACA SOP at 18.6 \n2 Defendants claim that this plain reading of the DACA SOP “would render \n3 meaningless the specific termination ground that continuation of deferred action is not \n4 consistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities.” Dkt. 44 at 24. Mr. Gonzalez already \n5 explained why this argument fails. See Dkt. 39-1 at 26 n.7. The enforcement priority \n6 termination ground reflects the reality that DHS may “repeal” its current enforcement \n7 priority policies for DACA beneficiaries and “substitute new rules in their place.” \n8 Romeiro de Silva, 773 F.2d at 1025. But until then, Defendants remain “bound by” the \n9 “operative” rules, under which Mr. Gonzalez—as a DACA recipient without any \n10 criminal charge or conviction, or finding that he is a public safety concern—is not an \n11 enforcement priority. Id.; see Dkt. 39-1 at 11-12 (DHS explaining that DACA’s \n12 enforcement priority terms remain unchanged). In truth, it is Defendants’ argument that \n13 the enforcement priority termination ground is standardless and leaves their personnel \n14 without “constrain[t]” that would render meaningless all of the other DACA \n15 termination grounds. Why have specifically delineated termination categories if, as \n16 Defendants assert, enforcement priority means whatever a USCIS officer wants it to \n17 mean? \n18 Moreover, Defendants’ unmoored approach would run afoul of DHS’s statutory \n19 obligation to “establish[] national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.” 6 \n20 U.S.C. § 202(5). It is Defendants’ burden to define the “enforcement priorities” that \n21 justify DACA termination, and they have done so in the DACA Memo and SOP. They \n22 defined DACA recipients who meet the SOP’s objectively verifiable criteria as low \n23 priority cases and enumerated a series of events—criminal convictions, findings of \n24 public safety or national security concern, or EPS findings—that could make them an \n25 enforcement priority. Including additional language that permits termination when \n26 continued DACA status is not consistent with Defendants’ enforcement priorities does \n27                                          \n6 Indeed, “for DACA,” USCIS “references” the DACA Memo to ensure compliance \n28\nwith the SOP. Apr. 4, 2013 DACA SOP at 16. Therefore, DACA enforcement \npriorities must also be defined by “reference” to the DACA Memo, which exempts a \nDACA recipient who meets its objective criteria from enforcement priority status. \n  8 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1292   Page 14 of 17\n \n1 not relieve Defendants of their obligation to say what those priorities are and to \n2 terminate DACA only when an individual falls within one of the defined categories. \n3 Defendants argue an untenable reading of the termination provision that would swallow \n4 the proverbial rule. The Court should reject the argument out of hand.7 \n5 Finally, the Court may not consider Defendants’ post hoc explanation that Mr. \n6 Gonzalez is an enforcement priority by reference to the EPS section of the 2011 USCIS \n7 Memo. Nearly two years after first attempting to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA \n8 status, Defendants have never found that he was an EPS case. ICE never did it. CBP \n9 never did it. And neither did USCIS. It is therefore not a proper ground for termination \n10 to raise before this Court, which may only consider “explanations offered by the \n11 agency.” Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055, 1064 (9th Cir. 2015). Defendants either did not \n12 consider the EPS ground or concluded, as the judge who released him 21 months ago \n13 did, that Mr. Gonzalez does not present any public safety concern, let alone an \n14 egregious one. See Shirrod v. Director, 809 F.3d 1082, 1087 n.4 (9th Cir. 2015) (court \n15 must “review only what the agency did, not what [it] could have done”). Defendants’ \n16 post hoc rationalization also makes no sense. In an EPS case, they would not have \n17 issued Mr. Gonzalez an NOIT, but would have “automatically” terminated his DACA \n18 status. The enforcement priority ground of the DACA SOP is the only one before this \n19 Court. The DACA Memo and SOP define that ground. And Defendants ignored that \n20 definition. \nV.  IF DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS COMPORT WITH THE DACA MEMO \n21 AND SOP, THEY VIOLATE DUE PROCESS \n22 No matter what the SOP permits, the Constitution cannot countenance DACA \n23 status termination (1) on the basis of a USCIS officer’s determination on a paper record \n24 that Mr. Gonzalez is a criminal, (2) after an Immigration Judge found him credible, so \n25 that he has resumed his law-abiding life in San Diego, (3) nearly two years after he was \n26 arrested without any charges, further investigation beyond two days after his arrest in \n27 May 2016, prior or subsequent law enforcement encounters, or public safety concerns, \n                                         \n28 7 Defendants have not come forward with a definition. Should the Court disagree \nwith Mr. Gonzalez’s (and the SOP’s) definition, it should ensure that Defendants bear \nthe burden of illuminating the correct definition, as is their statutory obligation. \n  9 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1293   Page 15 of 17\n \n1 (4) without the opportunity to know the facts that would guide the termination decision, \n2 confront evidence or witnesses, or rebut factual allegations, and (5) without any chance \n3 to be heard by a neutral arbiter, rather than the same one who had already issued him a \n4 seemingly pre-determined notice of intent to terminate. See Dkt. 39-1 at 32-34. \n5 Once granted, Mr. Gonzalez has a constitutionally protected interest in DACA \n6 status—the result of a deal with the government, not unilateral expectation. At least one \n7 court has rejected DHS’s assertion “that there can be no violation of [a DACA \n8 recipient’s] Due Process rights because no process is actually due”: \nIn creating the DACA policy/program, the federal government recognized \n9\nthat there were thousands of young people unlawfully present in our country, \nthat lacked the intent to violate the law, and that had contributed to our \n10\ncountry in significant ways, and that its immigration enforcement resources \nshould not be spent on low priority cases such as those. The policy then set \n11\nforth criteria to be considered when determining whether to grant DACA to \nan applicant. These criteria established a quid pro quo from the federal \n12\ngovernment to the potential applicants—i.e., you (applicant) make yourself \nknown to us (federal government) and pass rigorous background checks, \n13\netc., and in return you will be considered for DACA, which in turn will \nallow you the opportunity to remain in the country, work, and potentially \n14\nreceive other state benefits. Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *9. \n15\nDefendants’ behavior is not consonant with a program that exists solely for the \n16\nadministrative convenience of the government, but rather one that confers benefits \n17\nbased on “mutually explicit understandings.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 \n18\n(1972). Indeed, DHS recently explained that it views DACA status as “confer[ring] \n19\naffirmative benefits.” Pet. for Writ of Cert. at 12, DHS v. Regents, No. 17-1003 (Jan. \n20\n18, 2018), available at https://goo.gl/Tjvaqg. \n21\nDACA’s well-defined framework, specific operating procedures, and mandatory \n22\nlanguage “greatly restrict the discretion of the people who administer it” and underscore \n23\nthe property interests conferred by DACA status. Nozzi v. Housing Auth. of LA, 806 \n24\nF.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015); Wedges/Ledges of Calif., Inc. v. Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, \n25\n63 (9th Cir. 1994). And the DACA Memo’s boilerplate that it “confers no substantive \n26\nright” is not determinative. The question “turns on the substance of the interest \n27\nrecognized, not the name given that interest by the state.” Newman v. \n28\nSathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d 786, 797 (9th Cir. 2002). \n \n  10 \nPLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 46   Filed 02/12/18   PageID.1294   Page 16 of 17\n \nDated: February 12, 2018   Respectfully submitted, \n1\n \n2 /s/ John C.

Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the court finds the matters presented\n26\nappropriate for resolution without oral argument.  For the reasons set forth below, the\n27\n28\n1The court incorporates the Order herein.\n- 1 -\n17cv1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 63   Filed 07/20/18   PageID.1563   Page 2 of 4\n1 court denies the motion for reconsideration.  \n2 DISCUSSION\n3 Reconsideration is generally appropriate “if the district court (1) is presented\n4 with newly discovered evidence, (2) committed clear error or the initial decision was\n5 manifestly unjust, or (3) if there is an intervening change in controlling law. . . . There\n6 may also be other, highly unusual circumstances warranting reconsideration.\"  School\n7 Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County, Oregon v. ACandS, Inc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.\n8 1993) (citations omitted); Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\n9 Plaintiff raises several arguments previously addressed in the Order, and only\n10 briefly discussed herein.  In the main, Plaintiff contends that the court committed clear\n11 error by concluding, under APA review, that Defendants’ challenged conduct was\n12 neither arbitrary, capricious nor contrary to law.  Defendants complied with DACA in\n13 revoking Plaintiff’s DACA status by concluding, in their discretion, that he constituted\n14 an enforcement priority based upon his involvement in alien smuggling (i.e. conduct\n15 that violated  8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and §1182(a)(6)(E)(i)).2  Plaintiff seeks to\n16 limit Defendants’ ability to exercise their discretion in determining DHS’s enforcement\n17 priority to only those situations where the DACA recipient possesses a disqualifying\n18 criminal conviction, a public safety concern finding, a national security concern finding\n19 or an EPS (Egregious Public Safety) finding.  For the reasons set forth in the Order, \n20 the court rejects this argument.3   \n21\n22 2 The court again highlights that the veracity or falsity of Plaintiff’s involvement\nin human trafficking is not an issue before the court.  Defendants’ proffer of proof\n23 supports their conclusion that Plaintiff engaged in conduct that violated 8 U.S.C.\n§1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and §1182(a)(6)(E)(i).\n24\n3 The court further notes that Congress authorizes the Attorney General to\n25 exercise broad discretion in the immigration context, see I.N.S. v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526\nU.S.  415,  425  (1999),  including  the  determination  of  deportability  based  upon\n26 circumstances not involving a criminal conviction, an EPS finding, a public safety\nthreat determination, or a national security threat determination.  For example, those\n27 circumstances may include the change in immigration status, involvement in alien\nsmuggling,  marriage  fraud,  drug abuse,  etc.  See  8  U.S.C. §1227.  Contrary to\n28 Plaintiff’s arguments, the so-called Kelly Memo neither expands nor limits DHS’s\nauthority to exercise its discretion in determining enforcement priorities under the INA\n- 2 -\n17cv1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 63   Filed 07/20/18   PageID.1564   Page 3 of 4\n1 Plaintiff also argues that the November 17, 2017 NOIT, (ECF 39-6 at 9-10),\n2 violated his due process rights by failing to provide him with adequate notice of the\n3 “events or facts [DHS] w[as] relying on” in revoking his DACA status.  Plaintiff\n4 correctly  asserts  that  the  NOIT  does  not  directly  inform  him  of  the  basis  and\n5 circumstances for revocation of his DACA status.  However, the NOIT made express\n6 reference to this action and the first revocation of his DACA status.  In any event, by\n7 means of the on-going administrative proceedings and this action, Plaintiff does not\n8 dispute that he had actual notice of the underlying basis and circumstances for\n9 terminating his DACA status.  Similarly, there is no showing that he suffered any\n10 prejudice by such omission.  \n11 Finally, Plaintiff contends that his substantive due process rights were violated\n12 because of the “determination of criminality made by a non-neutral arbiter.”  (Motion\n13 at p.25:6-7).  Notably, Plaintiff cites scant authority to support this conclusion.\n14 In every case in which a plaintiff challenges the actions of an executive\nofficial under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause, he\n15 must  demonstrate  both  that  the  official's  conduct  was\nconscience-shocking,  [],  and  that  the  official  violated  one  or  more\n16 fundamental rights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation's history and\ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither\n17 liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.”\n18 Moran  v.  Clarke,  296  F.3d  638,  651  (8th  Cir.  2002)  (quoting  Washington  v.\n19 Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  720–21  (1997)).      Here,  there  is  no  indication  that\n20 Defendants engaged in any conscience-shocking or clearly arbitrary and unreasonable\n21 conduct, or that factual determinations by duly constituted administrative bodies made\n22 in the ordinary and normal course of an administrative proceeding violate the concept\n23 of “ordered liberty.”  Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his substantive due\n24 process claim.\n25 / / /\n26 / / /\n27 / / /\n28\nand DACA.\n- 3 -\n17cv1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 63   Filed 07/20/18   PageID.1565   Page 4 of 4\n1 In sum, the motion for reconsideration is denied.\n2 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n3 DATED:  July 20, 2018\n4\n   Hon.

Ulin, the proposed\n6 letter, and the news articles referenced therein and attached thereto.\n7 At the hearing, the Court expressed concerns about the potential adverse\n8 consequences, including immigration detention and removal from the country, that\n9 Mr. Gonzalez might face if his DACA status is allowed to lapse pending the\n10 Court’s opportunity to review whether Defendants’ current rushed termination\n11 process complies with the Court’s Order, the DACA SOP, and the Administrative\n12 Procedure Act. Defendants could provide no assurance that Mr. Gonzalez would\n13 not be subject to such adverse action. And the day after the hearing, a news report\n14 explained that just this week ICE has placed a Pennsylvania DACA recipient in\n15 immigration detention after his DACA status lapsed due to Postal Service errors\n16 with his renewal application, even though he was awaiting a letter from USCIS\n17 inviting him to re-submit his renewal application.

But many missed the tight deadline imposed by the\nadministration — just one month from the day they announced the sunsetting of the\nprogram — and others saw their applications rejected by the government for being\nlate, after languishing for weeks at a United States Postal Service processing center\nin Chicago.\nEnriquez is among those immigrants. According to the Trump administration, he’s\nsupposed to wait to be invited to reapply by US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nInstead, he’s being put on the road to deportation. (DHS did not respond to a request for\ncomment.)\nEnriquez might be the first known case of an immigrant getting detained by ICE after his\nDACA expired under the administration’s new rules. He’s almost certainly the first known\ncase of an immigrant getting detained while waiting to reapply for DACA renewal.\nHis presence there is perhaps the most vivid reminder yet that as Congress drags out what\nto do about DACA recipients, it will probably be too late for some.\nRELATED\nThe Trump administration rejected 4,000 \"late\" DACA renewals.

His fiancée has a green\ncard, and their son, who’s not quite a year old, was born in the United States.\nhttps://www.vox.com/2017/12/13/16772630/daca-expire-ice-arrest-deport 2/8\n\n12/14/2017Case 3:17-cv-018T4h0e -PJoMsta-lN SeLrvSic e   kDepot chiumm froemn rte n2e6wi-n3g  h i sF DiAleCdA . 1N2ow/1 h4e’/s1 in7 im   mPigaragtioenI Dde.te7n8tio7n .  -  PVoaxge 4 of 9\nFROM OUR SPONSOR CONTINUE FOR MORE CONTENT\nWhen the Trump administration announced on September 5 that it would end DACA,\nEnriquez’s work permit was set to expire in a little over a month — on October 15.\nAccording to the administration, that made him (and 154,000 other DACA recipients\nwhose work permits were set to expire before March 5, 2018) eligible to apply for a two-\nyear renewal of protections — but only if they got their applications in by October 5.\nEnriquez went to the Lancaster office of immigrant advocacy and legal services\norganization Church World Service for help with his renewal application. According to\nCCaarrrrie CCaarrrranza of CWS, his application was mailed September 18. “His application was\nmailed out at same time as many other DACA applications that have now been approved,”\nshe told Vox on Wednesday.\nBut Enriquez wasn’t so lucky. His application arrived at the USCIS service center in Chicago\non October 10 — three weeks after he mailed it, and five days after the deadline. It was\nrejected.\nAt the time, CCaarrrranza says, they didn’t really understand what had happened; “We told him,\n‘We’re so sorry this happened; you did everything right; it was just a fluke, a debacle, out of\nyour control.’”\nhttps://www.vox.com/2017/12/13/16772630/daca-expire-ice-arrest-deport 3/8\n\n12/14/2017Case 3:17-cv-018T4h0e -PJoMsta-lN SeLrvSic e   kDepot chiumm froemn rte n2e6wi-n3g  h i sF DiAleCdA . 1N2ow/1 h4e’/s1 in7 im   mPigaragtioenI Dde.te7n8tio8n .  -  PVoaxge 5 of 9\nIt turns out the scope of the “debacle” was beyond anything she could imagine. It is likely\nthat thousands of DACA renewal applications were mailed in advance of the deadline but\nwere slowed down by USPS delays — including many that were received at government\ndropboxes on October 5 but were rejected because they were not picked up until the next\nday.\nWhen reports from the New York Times and Vox highlighted the problem in November,\nUSCIS reversed itself, declaring that immigrants whose DACA renewals had been mailed\non time would be given the chance to reapply.\nIn guidance issued at the end of November (and included in the current FAQs about DACA\non the USCIS website), the government says, “The USPS is working with USCIS to\nidentify DACA requests that were received after the deadline due to USPS mail-service\ndelays” — like Enriquez’s.\n“As soon as USPS completes its assessment, identifies such requests, and provides this\ninformation to USCIS, USCIS will send affected DACA requestors a letter inviting them to\nresubmit their DACA request. If you receive such a letter, you will have 33 calendar days\nfrom the date of the letter to resubmit your request.”\nThe FAQ estimates that the Postal Service assessment will be done by “mid-December,”\nand that USCIS will send invitations to reapply about a week after that.\nBut in the meantime, Enriquez was in limbo. His work permit had expired, but he still had to\nwork to support his family; his driver’s license had expired, because it was only valid as\nlong as he had DACA, but he still needed to drive to get to work.\nOn Monday morning — six days before his son’s first birthday — as Enriquez drove down\nRoute 83 to his contracting job, he was pulled over by a Pennsylvania State Police officer.\nThe officer told him his vehicle registration had expired. Enriquez’s fiancée says the family\nthought they had kept their registration current; since Pennsylvania doesn’t put\nregistration-date stickers on license plates, CCaarrrranza speculates that the only way the\ntrooper would have known Enriquez’s registration had lapsed would be if she’d run his\nlicense plates when he drove by.\nEnriquez was ultimately issued a ticket not for the expired registration, but for his expired\ndriver’s license. But in the meantime, CCaarrrranza says, the state police officer had called\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement to come pick up Enriquez. ICE agents took him to\nhttps://www.vox.com/2017/12/13/16772630/daca-expire-ice-arrest-deport 4/8\n\n12/14/2017Case 3:17-cv-018T4h0e -PJoMsta-lN SeLrvSic e   kDepot chiumm froemn rte n2e6wi-n3g  h i sF DiAleCdA . 1N2ow/1 h4e’/s1 in7 im   mPigaragtioenI Dde.te7n8tio9n .  -  PVoaxge 6 of 9\nthe York detention center and served him with a notice to appear in immigration court —\nformally starting deportation proceedings against him.\nTwo days later, Enriquez is still in detention.\nUnless something changes, he’ll miss his son’s\nbirthday on Saturday.\nThe Trump administration made this\ninevitable, and only Congress can stop it\nAD\nfrom getting worse\nAdvocates and Democrats, extrapolating from\nUSCIS numbers, have estimated that 122\nimmigrants will lose their DACA protections\nevery day between October 5 and March 5.\n(That doesn’t count the immigrants arrested by\nICE despite still having DACA, or whose DACA protections have been stripped from them\nafter an arrest.)\nBut despite fears that ICE would use the information contained in DACA applications to\ntrack down and arrest immigrants, there don’t appear to have been any cases (at least, not\nany known to the public) in which immigrants who have lost DACA after September have\nactually been detained. Until now.\nBut what happened to Enriquez is the inevitable outcome of the way the Trump\nadministration wound down DACA. It gave immigrants an unusually short amount of time to\napply for renewal, then enforced stricter-than-usual rules about what counted as a timely\napplication. Their current plan to allow some immigrants affected by mail delays to reapply\nstill puts many immigrants at risk of a gap between one work permit expiring and a new\none being issued. And during that time, working, driving, and existing in the US put DACA-\neligible immigrants at just as much risk of deportation as any other unauthorized\nimmigrant.\nYou can’t understand the current debate in Congress over how and when to help DACA\nrecipients without understanding this phenomenon. Elected Democrats are extremely\naware that people are losing DACA every day, and many moderate Republicans also note\nthat the program is less effective the longer it’s allowed to wind down. But Republican\nleadership isn’t thinking about the program’s efficacy; it’s focused on the March 5\n“deadline” set by the White House, and sees no need to take action before then.\nhttps://www.vox.com/2017/12/13/16772630/daca-expire-ice-arrest-deport 5/8\n\n12/14/2017Case 3:17-cv-018T4h0e -PJoMsta-lN SeLrvSic e   kDepot chiumm froemn rte n2e6wi-n3g  h i sF DiAleCdA . 1N2ow/1 h4e’/s1 in7 im   mPigaragtioenI Dde.te7n9tio0n .  -  PVoaxge 7 of 9\nAt present, Democrats are trying to figure out if the urgency of DACA is enough to withhold\nvotes on a must-pass government funding bill days before Christmas — risking a\ngovernment shutdown — or whether to allow the issue to fall into 2018. If they pick the\nlatter, they’ll have to hope that Republicans see the March 5 deadline as a serious deadline,\nlike a government funding bill, and not a “deadline” like funding the Children’s Health\nInsurance Program (which Congress has allowed to lapse for 73 days and counting).\nAnd in the meantime, Osman Enriquez, and perhaps others like him, will be waiting in a\ndetention cell for Congress to make up its mind.\nCORRECTION: This article originally identified the CWS staffer in Lancaster as “CCaarrrrie\nHussein,” a name she no longer goes by.

An estimated 742,000\nDreamers have been given protection under the program.\nAt issue are those former DACA beneficiaries whose protected status was canceled either because of a criminal\nconviction or gang activity.\nImmigrant advocates say the rise in deportations of former Dreamers is likely a result of Trump’s executive\norders tightening border security and immigration enforcement.\nThe Obama administration prioritized deportation of immigrants who were deemed a danger to public safety,\nconvicted of a serious crime, a threat to national security or who had recently crossed the border.\n\"Given the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies, I'm not surprised that more people are being targeted\n— including individuals who are longtime residents who pose no danger, contribute to our society and\neconomy, and have U.S. citizen families,\" said Lucas Guttentag, a former senior advisor at the Department of\nHomeland Security under Obama who now teaches law at Stanford University.\nThe Department of Homeland Security says its policies on DACA have not changed.\n“The grounds for DACA termination have not changed since the inception of the program,” Gillian Christensen,\nacting Homeland Security press secretary, said in a statement. She said many of the former DACA beneficiaries\ndeported this year probably had their protected status terminated before Trump became president.\n“Individuals who pose a public safety threat due to their criminal history or gang affiliation are subject to DACA\nrevocation,” she said.\nYet it appears clear that those whose DACA protection is terminated are more likely to be a target for\ndeportation now that Trump has set new priorities for enforcement. Under the Obama administration,\nGuttentag said, someone could have his or her DACA status terminated yet remain a non-priority for removal if\nnot seen to pose a danger or convicted of a serious criminal offense.\n“The fact that they abandoned priorities didn’t change DACA,” Guttentag said. “But if a DACA recipient does\nsomething to lose eligibility, that could not make him or her vulnerable.”\nUnder Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order, immigrants in the country illegally can be deported if they are merely\ncharged with a crime, as opposed to having a criminal conviction. All 43 former Dreamers deported since\nTrump’s inauguration had been convicted of crimes or found to have gang affiliations, Christensen said in an\nemail. She declined to provide any breakdown of the crimes that prompted their DACA status to be revoked.\nMore than 670 former Dreamers currently face removal proceedings, with 90 detained in custody, according to\nHomeland Security data.\nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-daca-deportations-20170419-story.html 2/3\n\n12/14/2017Case 3:17-cv-0184D0ep-JorMtat-ioNnsL oSf ' D r eDamoecrsu' mwheo'nvet  lo2s6t p-r4o te  cFteidl estdat u1s 2ha/1ve4 s/u1rg7e d   uPndaegr TeruIDmp.7 - 9LA6 T  im Pesage 4 of 4\nThe deportation figures released by the Homeland Security Department show that while 43 former DACA\nimmigrants were deported from Jan. 20 to March 25, 20 were allowed to remain in the country.\nWhile a total of 365 were deported during the four-plus years the DACA program was carried out under Obama,\nmore than 500 were released from immigration custody.\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based research\ninstitute that advocates stricter immigration policy, cautioned that it is too early to know how deportations will\nproceed under Trump.\n“We have years of data on Obama policy and only weeks of data on Trump policies,” she said. “But it does\nappear if you have DACA and it was revoked, you are more likely to be deported under the Trump\nadministration than the Obama administration.”\nIn addition to deporting former Dreamers with criminal convictions, Vaughan said she would not be surprised\nif the new administration also starts going after those who have not renewed their DACA status or are found to\nhave obtained it fraudulently.\n“The Obama administration put a lot of restraints on ICE,” Vaughan said, referring to the Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement agency. “The Trump administration is starting from the standpoint that anyone here\nillegally is potentially subject to deportation. ICE officers are not going to be turning the other way.”\nALSO\nA 23-year-old 'Dreamer' sues the Trump administration over his deportation to Mexico\n'Dreamer' threatened with deportation in Seattle is released after weeks of detention\nYes, Trump can boost deportations and gut the Dreamer program for young immigrants\nCopyright © 2017, Los Angeles Times\nThis article is related to: Immigration, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-daca-deportations-20170419-story.html 3/3",

Dkt. No 38. At the heart of Plaintiff’s claim is the bald assertion that \n88 Plaintiff cannot be an enforcement priority because “DACA recipients are ‘low priority \n99 cases.’” Dkt. No. 38 at 1. \n1111   The Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s FAC. First, Plaintiff lacks standing to challenge \n1122 Defendants’ initial termination of his DACA through issuance of an NTA. As a result of \n1133 the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n1144 (“September 29, 2017 Order”), USCIS reinstated Plaintiff’s DACA, accepted his DACA \n1155 renewal request, issued Plaintiff a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) his reinstated \n1166 DACA, Dkt. Nos. 14-1 & 14-2; Dkt. No. 38 at ¶¶ 132-134; 39-6 at ¶¶ 191-192, and \n1177 issued a Termination Decision (“Decision”) that will terminate Plaintiff’s DACA as of \n1188 December 21, 2017, upon further order of this Court. See Dkt. No. 39-6 at 194-197.1 \n1199 Thus, the initial termination of Plaintiff’s DACA is no longer a final agency action, and \n2200 amendment of his complaint after Defendants’ subsequent termination of his DACA \n2211 precludes Plaintiff from establishing standing over the initial termination.  \n2222\n                                                 \n2233 1 Although Plaintiff neither cites nor attaches USCIS’s NOIT or Termination Decision to his amended \ncomplaint, the Court may take judicial notice of those documents and Defendants’ policies and guidance \n2244 under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, as agency materials, see Report Cactus Corner, LLC v. U.S. Dep't of \nAgric., 346 F.Supp.2d 1075, 1100 (E.D. Cal. 2004) aff’d, 450 F.3d 428 (9th Cir. 2006), and materials from \n2255\nproceedings in other tribunals, see Biggs v. Terhune, 334 F.3d 910, 915 n.3 (9th Cir. 2003). For ease of \n2266 reference, Defendants refer to previously docketed versions of these materials found at Dkt. Nos. 14 and \n39. Courts may consider documents subject to judicial notice in deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) facial attack. \n2277 See, e.g., PNC Equip. Fin., LLC v. California Fairs Fin. Auth., No. CV1106248MMMDTBX, 2012 WL \n12506870, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2012). \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1317   Page 11 of 30\n \n11   This Court also lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims because: the Immigration \n22 and Nationality Act (“INA”) precludes review over Defendants’ decision and actions \n33 regarding the adjudication of Plaintiff’s removal proceedings – including the termination \n44 of DACA – and any claims the INA preserves for review must be channeled through \n55 Plaintiff’s removal proceedings; Defendants’ exercise of prosecutorial discretion is not \n66 appropriate for judicial review; and the Plaintiff cannot establish a constitutional interest \n77 sufficient to proceed on his Due Process claims.2  \n88 BACKGROUND \n99 Here, as a result of the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order, USCIS reinstated \n1111 Plaintiff’s DACA, accepted his DACA renewal request, issued Plaintiff a Notice of Intent \n1122 to Terminate (NOIT) his reinstated DACA, Dkt. Nos. 14-1 & 14-2; Dkt. No. 39-6 at 191-\n1133 192, and issued a Termination Decision (“Decision”) that will terminate Plaintiff’s \n1144 DACA as of December 21, 2017, upon further order of this Court. See Dkt. No. 39-6 at \n1155 194-197. That Decision specifically referenced the DACA SOP, Dkt. No. 39-6 at 195 (“If \nafter consulting with ICE, USCIS determines that exercising prosecutorial discretion after \n1166\nremoval has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with the Department of \n1177\nHomeland Security's enforcement priorities . . . .”), quoting Dkt. No. 2-9 at 15, and goes \n1188\non to consider Plaintiff’s arguments in response to USCIS’s NOIT before concluding, the \n1199\nagency’s discretion, that termination of DACA is warranted.  \n2200\n2211  \n2222  \n2233                                                  \n2“The decision of a trial or appellate court whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction does not \n2244 constitute the law of the case for the purposes of further proceedings and does not limit or preclude the \nparties from litigating the merits. . . .” Berrigan v. Sigler, 499 F.2d 514, 518 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see also \n2255\nWalt Disney Productions v. Filmation, 628 F. Supp. 871, 879 (C.D. Cal. 1986) (stating that appraisal of \n2266 the “likelihood of success” standard is not a final decision on the merits). Moreover, the doctrine itself is \na guide to the Court’s discretion rather than a limit on the Court’s jurisdiction. See United States v. \n2277 Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir. 1997), citing Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983). \nCourts may depart from this doctrine in cases, inter alia, of clear error or changed circumstances – both of \n2288\nwhich Defendants contend are applicable here. Alexander, 106 F.3d at 876.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1318   Page 12 of 30\n \n11 ARGUMENT \n22 I.  Standard of Review \n33\nA. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \n44\nBecause federal courts have limited jurisdiction, a court must dismiss any case if it \n55\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); Owen Equip. & \n66\nErection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978). “A federal court is presumed to lack \n77\njurisdiction in a particular case unless the contrary affirmatively appears.” Stock W., Inc. \n88\nv. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989). \n99\nThe elements necessary to establish standing “must be supported in the same way as any \n1111 other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.” Lujan v. Defenders of \n1122 Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). Moreover, when the issue of jurisdiction is separable \n1133 from the merits of the case, no presumption of truthfulness attaches to a plaintiff’s \n1144 allegations, and the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists. Thornhill \n1155 Publ’g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1979). \n1166 The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” to assert federal court \n1177 jurisdiction requires “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact . . . which is . . . \n1188 concrete and particularized, . . . the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged \n1199 action of the defendant, and . . . it must be likely . . . that the injury will be redressed by a \n2200 favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations and modifications omitted).  \n2211 “Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art[icle] III.” \n2222 Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enf’t Admin., 860 F.3d \n2233 1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 2017), citing Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1141 \n2244 (2013). Finally, while an imminent future harm may establish standing, the harm alleged \n2255 cannot be the result of plaintiff’s own unlawful conduct. Id. at 1042, quoting O’Shea v. \n2266 Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974). \n2277  \n2288  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1319   Page 13 of 30\n \n11 B. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \n22 To survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), “the complaint must allege sufficient \n33 facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n44 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Although the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded \n55 factual allegations when determining the legal sufficiency of a claim, it need not credit \n66 “legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.” Id. at 555. “Threadbare recitals of the \n77 elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” \n88 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \n99 II.  Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Raise Claims Regarding the Enjoined May 2016 \nTermination of his DACA.  \n1111\nWhen “a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the \n1122\ncomplaint, courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.” Rockwell \n1133\nInt’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007); see also Forziano v. Indep. Grp. \n1144\nHome Living Program, Inc., 613 F. App’x 15, 17 (2d Cir. 2015) (citations omitted) (“The \n1155\ndistrict court properly assessed the plaintiffs’ standing to request an injunction based on \n1166\nthe amended complaint, which ‘supercede[d] the original, and render[ed] it of no legal \n1177\neffect.’”); Clay v. Wells Fargo Home, N.A., No. 13-CV-338-KJM(GGHx), 2013 U.S. \n1188\nDist. LEXIS 39689, at *7 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2013) (“As the amended complaint \n1199\nsupersedes the original complaint, and the asserted basis for the preliminary injunction is \n2200\nno longer before the court, the pending motion is moot.”); La Jolla Cove Inv’rs, Inc. v. \n2211\nGoConnect Ltd., No. 11CV1907 JLS JMA, 2012 WL 1580995, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 4, \n2222\n2012) (“Noting that an amended complaint supersedes any previous complaint, the Court \n2233\ndenied the pending motions as moot, but permitted La Jolla Cove to refile its motion for a \n2244\npreliminary injunction, directing it to ‘address[ ] how the amendments impact the relief \n2255\nrequested.’”). \n2266\n2277 Defendants previously argued that this claim, and the Court’s injunction based on \n2288 this claim, became moot upon the reinstatement of Plaintiff’s DACA, Dkt. No. 31 at 2, \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1320   Page 14 of 30\n \n11 n.2. However, by amending his complaint after the May 2016 termination was no longer \n22 in effect the question of mootness turns into one of standing. Now, Plaintiff Gonzalez \n33 lacks standing to challenge a procedural and final agency action that he is no longer \n44 subject to because Defendants, in compliance with this Court’s Order, reinstated \n55 Plaintiff’s DACA and then terminated it again with advance notice and an opportunity to \n66 respond specifically based on procedures identified in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n77 Service’s DACA Standard Operating Procedures. See, e.g., Forziano, 613 F. App’x at 17.  \n88 III.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction, and any Judicial Challenges to Removal Must \nbe Brought in a Petition for Review. \n99\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) permits persons aggrieved by final agency \n1111\naction to obtain judicial review in federal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a \n1122\ncourt.” See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. A reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be \n1133\n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or \n1144\n“without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). However, the \n1155\nAPA precludes judicial review of agency decisions when “statutes preclude judicial review,” or \n1166\nwhen the decision is “committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), (a)(2); see \n1177\nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985) (explaining that “even where Congress has not \n1188\naffirmatively precluded review, review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court \n1199\nwould have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of \n2200\ndiscretion.”).  \n2211\nCongress enacted section 1252(g) to specifically preclude judicial review of the \n2222\ndiscretionary decision to initiate removal proceedings, and the actions and decisions arising out \n2233\nof such decisions. See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, \n2244\n483-85 (1999) (finding section 1252(g) also precludes review of the discretionary decision to \n2255\nnot initiate removal proceedings). Furthermore, in Heckler, the Supreme Court held that “an \n2266\nagency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from \n2277\njudicial review under § 701(a)(2).” 470 U.S. 821, 832.  \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1321   Page 15 of 30\n \n11 Here, the INA specifically precludes review of the actions that Plaintiff challenges. \n22 Moreover, the challenged action, an individual DACA decision, falls squarely within that \n33 category of actions for which there is no law to apply, as it is a decision implicating \n44 prosecutorial discretion. See Heckler, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, \n55 824 F.3d 822, 828 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is \n66 a type of government action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial \n77 intervention”); accord Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (explaining that \n88 “[i]n making immigration enforcement decisions, the executive considers a variety of \n99 factors”), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 900, (2016), reh’g denied, 136 S. Ct. 1250 (2016). \n1111 Contrary to Plaintiff’s arguments, Defendants’ guidance does not curtail the well-\n1122 recognized discretion with regard to deferred action decisions. \n1133 Additionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s constitutional claims \n1144 because Plaintiff necessarily lacks a protected constitutional interest in the DACA \n1155 termination process, because the ultimate relief he seeks – deferred action – is \ndiscretionary. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  \n1166\n1177 A. The INA Limits Review of Plaintiff’s Claims which Arise from DHS’s \nDecision to Commence and Adjudicate Plaintiff’s Removal Proceedings. \n1188\nThrough the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005 and codified at 8 \n1199\nU.S.C. § 1252(g), Congress explicitly eliminated judicial review over “any cause or claim \n2200\nby or on behalf of any alien . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to commence \n2211\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this \n2222\nchapter.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Section 1252(g) was “directed against a particular evil: \n2233\nattempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” AADC, 525 U.S. at \n2244\n485 n.9; cf. Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (rejecting contention \n2255\nthat section 1252(g) applies only to discretionary decisions of the Secretary).  \n2266\nThe fact that Plaintiff frames his claim as a challenge to a DACA determination \n2277\nrather than expressly requesting the enjoining of adjudication of his removal proceedings \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1322   Page 16 of 30\n \n11 is irrelevant because section 1252(g) precludes judicial review of “any” claim “arising” \n22 from “the decision or action” to adjudicate cases (not just express challenges to the \n33 adjudication itself). See, e.g., Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004) \n44 (finding review of the reopening of removal proceedings, but not the administrative \n55 closure of proceedings, was barred from review as an action related to the decision to \n66 commence removal); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing AADC, \n77 525 U.S. at 944 (discussing the scope of section 1252(g) as including “various decisions . \n88 . . leading up to order consequent upon final orders of deportation.”)). \n99 To the extent Plaintiff’s reply brief will likely reiterate arguments made in his \n1111 Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Court should reject, as contrary to section 1252(g), \n1122 Plaintiff’s contention that he is challenging the Government’s decision-making process \n1133 rather than the final decision itself. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 23.3 Section 1252(g) is not limited to \n1144 claims arising from the adjudication of cases nor is it limited to only discretionary actions. \n1155 Cf. Silva, 866 F.3d at 940. Defendants disagree with the Court’s prior citation to United \nStates v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004), for the proposition that judicial \n1166\nreview is preserved for purely legal conclusions. Dkt. No. 12 at 8. There, the Ninth \n1177\nCircuit held that section 1252(g) did not apply because “the gravamen of [the alien’s] \n1188\nclaim does not arise from the Attorney General’s decision or action to commence \n1199\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.” Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1155 \n2200\n(9th Cir. 2004).4 Additionally, Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328 (N.D. Ga. June 12, \n2211\n2017), is of no assistance here. There, the court noted that section 1252(g) eliminates \n2222\n                                                 \n2233\n3 Where Plaintiff has offered arguments in his brief in support of his motion for preliminary injunction \n[Dkt. No. 39-1] that address Defendants’ arguments against his amended complaint [Dkt. No. 38], \n2244\nDefendants reference that motion in anticipation of Plaintiff’s likely incorporation of those arguments in \n2255 response to Defendants’ arguments herein. \n2266 4 Hovsepian considered a purely legal question preceding a discretionary decision. Here, however, the \nDACA SOP identifies threshold criteria for DACA consideration, but it does not mandate granting DACA \n2277 if those threshold criteria are met. See DACA SOP Chapter 8 at 45 (April 2013 version) (“Individuals may \nbe considered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”), available at \n2288\nhttps://cliniclegal.org/sites/default/files/attachments/daca_sop_4-4-13.pdf (last visited Feb. 5, 2018). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1323   Page 17 of 30\n \n11 “jurisdiction to review the government’s ultimate discretionary determination as to \n22 Plaintiff’s DACA [ ].” Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1339 (citations omitted). \n33 Moreover, Plaintiff’s claim that constitutional claims are preserved \n44 notwithstanding section 1252(g) similarly fails. See Dkt. No. 39-1 at 23. On this point, \n55 the Court’s prior reliance on Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2003), is \n66 also misplaced. See Dkt. No. 12 at 8. There, the Ninth Circuit did not even consider \n77 section 1252(g) and analyzed only the jurisdiction limitation statute at section \n88 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) holding that “[w]hether the BIA’s interpretation of the hardship standard \n99 violates due process is not a “judgment regarding the granting of” cancellation of \n1111 removal relief.” Ramirez-Perez, 336 F.3d at 1005. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit has held \n1122 that “a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by \n1133 cloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb.” See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, \n1144 1271 (9th Cir. 2001). And, even for a court to find that section 1252(g) does not preclude \n1155 review of constitutional claims, those claims must “not arise from ‘a decision or Action \nby the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal \n1166\norders against any alien,’ but instead constitute ‘general collateral challenges to \n1177\nunconstitutional practices and policies used by the agency.’” Walter v.

Rather, claims that fall within the limitations of section 1252(g) are not subject \n2200\nto review, even if cast as constitutional claims. See Sissoko v.

United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004). In \nWong, plaintiff’s counsel expressly disclaimed any challenge to the execution of removal and explained \n2266\nthat her claims only implicated “actions other than that removal, or the commencement of proceedings . . \n.,” 373 F.3d at 964, for which the court held that the claims at issue in Wong did not implicate the agency’s \n2277\nprosecutorial discretion and did not pose a threat of “obstruction of the institution of removal proceedings \n2288 or the execution of removal orders . . . .” Id. at 970.

See Garcia-Herrera v. Asher, 585 F. App’x 439, 440 (9th Cir. 2014) \n33 (holding under section 1252(g) that petitioner’s challenge to ICE’s decision not to delay \n44 his removal proceeding pending the adjudication of his DACA request constituted a \n55 challenge to ICE’s decision to execute a removal order); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x \n66 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016) (finding no jurisdiction to review a denial of a DACA request \n77 because “that decision involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a \n88 deferred action.”); see also Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir. 2012) \n99 (“[W]e lack jurisdiction to review petitioners’ contention that the agency abused its \n1111 discretion in denying the motion to reopen to seek prosecutorial discretion based on the \n1122 recent order of President Obama.”); Rodriguez v. Sessions, No. 15-72487, 2017 WL \n1133 695192, at *1 (9th Cir. Feb. 22, 2017); Fabian-Lopez v. Holder, No. 11-71513, 540 F. \n1144 App’x 760, 761 n.2 (9th Cir. Apr. 29, 2013); cf. Sanchez v. Holder, No. 15CV0089-GPC \n1155 WVG, 2015 WL 4249446 (S.D. Cal. July 13, 2015) (district court lacked jurisdiction to \nstay removal and make determination whether deferred action was warranted). \n1166\nThis recent authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 \n1177\nOperating Instructions, a previous policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of \n1188\ndeferred action.  That authority concluded that district courts lack jurisdiction to review \n1199\nthe district director’s decision not to recommend deferred action. Romeiro de Silva v. \n2200\nSmith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985). Plaintiff ignores that holding and instead \n2211\nrelies on Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979) for the purported reviewability of \n2222\nan internal deferred action policy with “‘express criteria’ and ‘periodic review of non-\n2233\npriority status’ [that] ‘clearly and directly affects substantive rights,’ including ‘the ability \n2244\nof an individual subject to its provisions to continue residence in the United States.’” Dkt. \n2255\n2266\n2277                                                  \nproceedings and DACA termination could have a direct result in his removal from the United States.  \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1325   Page 19 of 30\n \n11 No. 39-1 at 28, citing Nicholas, 590 F.2d at 807-08.6 There, the Ninth Circuit held that \n22 the five express humanitarian factors in the 1978 Operating Instructions,7 the effect of a \n33 grant of such non-priority status to provide an indefinite delay in deportation, and the \n44 directive nature of the language (“‘In Every case’” where relief is appropriate, the District \n55 Director ‘Shall recommend’ deferred action category”), made it “obvious that this \n66 procedure exists out of consideration for the convenience of the petitioner, and not that of \n77 the INS.” Id. at 806-07. While the Ninth Circuit considered periodic review an important \n88 factor, it conditioned its analysis in consideration that “the Instruction plainly \n99 contemplates a scheme where the status would preclude any deportation as long as the \n1111 relevant humanitarian factors are still compelling, rather than being subject to termination \n1122 at the convenience of the INS.” Id. at 807. \n1133 In contrast to Nicholas, Romeiro de Silva’s request for deferred action was denied \n1144 after “[t]he INS district director considered each of these factors.” Romeiro de Silva, 773 \n1155 F.2d at 1023. The Ninth Circuit, however, acknowledged the weight of authority finding \nthat deferred action determinations under the 1978 operating instructions unreviewable, \n1166\nand held that under the 1981 Operating Instructions “the district court lacked jurisdiction \n1177\nto review the district director’s decision not to recommend deferred action status for \n1188\nRomeiro de Silva,” because “it is no longer possible to conclude that [the instruction] is \n1199\nintended to confer any benefit upon aliens, rather than [to operate] merely for the INS’s \n2200\nown convenience.” Id. at 1024-25.  \n2211\n2222                                                  \n6 Notably, even in Nicholas, the Court ultimately denied the appeal on Nicholas’ claim to eligibility for \n2233\nnon-priority status as defined in the INS’s 1978 Operating Instructions because he could not meet his \nburden to show that the Government’s decision “deviated from an established pattern without reason” \n2244\nnotwithstanding the presence of humanitarian factors. 590 F.2d at 808. Nicholas’s request was verbally \n2255 denied, apparently without further explanation or process. Id. at 804.  \n2266 7 “When determining whether a case should be recommended for deferred action category, consideration \nshould include the following: (1) advanced or tender age; (2) many years’ presence in the United States; \n2277 (3) physical or mental condition requiring care or treatment in the United States; (4) family situation in \nthe United States effect of expulsion; (5) criminal, immoral, or subversive activities or affiliations recent \n2288\nconduct.” Nicholas, 590 F.2d at 806-807, citing 1978 INS Operating Instruction at 103.1(a)(1)(ii). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1326   Page 20 of 30\n \n11 The Supreme Court’s decision in AADC held that section 1252(g) applied to bar \n22 these same types of deferred action determinations. AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-87 (“At each \n33 stage the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor, and at the time IIRIRA was \n44 enacted the INS had been engaging in a regular practice (which had come to be known as \n55 “deferred action”) of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its \n66 own convenience.”). There, the Government ended prior grants of deferred action by \n77 charging, and then pursuing deportation for only routine status violations against six of \n88 the eight plaintiffs. Id. at 474. Importantly, the Court held that aliens unlawfully in the \n99 United States and subject to deferred action had “no constitutional right to assert selective \n1111 enforcement as a defense against his deportation,” under the First or Fifth Amendments \n1122 to the U.S. Constitution. Id. at 489. \n1133 Here, the similarities to both the policies and procedures addressed by the Ninth \n1144 Circuit and Supreme Court are too strong for the Court to reason around Congress’s clear \n1155 intent. Plaintiff’s claims are barred by section 1252(g) because he is asserting claims \narising from the commencement of and adjudication of his removal proceedings. Because \n1166\nPlaintiff claims that it was improper for DHS to terminate his DACA because “ICE’s \n1177\nlitigation of removal proceedings for unlawful presence against a DACA recipient was \n1188\nnot a valid basis for USCIS to terminate DACA under the SOP,” and “removal from the \n1199\ncountry in the absence of any culpability would visit such grievous harm,” Dkt. No. 38 at \n2200\n¶¶ 136; 14 [of Count Three],8 he is necessarily challenging the “commencement” and \n2211\n“adjudicat[ion]” of his ongoing removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Indeed, \n2222\nbecause the denial of DACA is a step “leading up to” a final order of removal, it is \n2233\nsquarely within the scope of section 1252(g). Id. Plaintiff’s effort to shroud his claims in \n2244\nprocedural terms is further undone by his challenge to ICE’s identification of Plaintiff as \n2255\na removal priority and decision to pursue his removal because “[o]nly individuals who do \n2266\n2277\n                                                 \n2288 8 Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint restarts paragraph numbering with paragraph 1 under Count Three on \npage 39, following paragraph 173 under Count Two.

No. 38 ¶ 169. Finally, were the Court to find that a final removal \n33 against Plaintiff could not be executed based in some way on his claimed entitlement to \n44 DACA, then the issues raised here are certainly those for which this Court lacks \n55 jurisdiction.  \n66 Regardless of how Plaintiff frames the issue, section 1252(g) precludes judicial \n77 review of the Government’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. Accordingly, the \n88 decisions of DHS to issue an NTA and place Plaintiff in removal proceedings, and thereby \n99 terminate DACA, and subsequent decision to terminate Plaintiff’s DACA following advance \n1111 notice and an opportunity to respond are not subject to judicial review, and the Court should \n1122 reject Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief. To hold otherwise would render section \n1133 1252(g) a dead letter because any individual could seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge \n1144 the commencement of removal proceedings through this type of creative pleading. \n1155 To the extent that Plaintiff has any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified at 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars him from raising those claims in district court, \n1166\neven before a final order of removal issues. Section 1252(a)(5), entitled “[e]xclusive \n1177\nmeans of review,” requires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of \n1188\nappeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of \n1199\nremoval . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides “[j]udicial review of \n2200\nall questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional \n2211\nand statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove \n2222\nan alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial \n2233\nreview of a final order under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (emphasis added); see, \n2244\ne.g., J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1038 (9th Cir. 2016) (district court lacked \n2255\njurisdiction over challenge to adequacy of removal procedures, and instead court of \n2266\nappeals has authority to resolve questions of constitutional rights on review of a final \n2277\nremoval order).  \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n12 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1328   Page 22 of 30\n \n11 Section 1252(b)(9) is “a clear statutory prescription against district court review” \n22 of challenges arising from removal proceedings for plaintiffs who had not yet received \n33 final orders of removal. J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1035-38. While the Court acknowledged \n44 that “an unrepresented minor in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult \n55 situation,” it also found “these considerations cannot overcome a clear statutory \n66 prescription against district court review. Relief is through review in the court of appeals \n77 or executive or congressional action.” Id. at 1036-38.9   \n88 Here, Plaintiff challenges the Secretary’s discretion to terminate DACA following \n99 the decision to issue Plaintiff an NTA. See Dkt. No. 38 ¶¶ 136, 158. Thus, Plaintiff’s \n1111 challenge necessarily arises from “action taken or proceedings brought to remove an \n1122 alien,” for which district courts lack jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court should find that \n1133 Plaintiff cannot show either a likelihood of success or that the law and facts clearly favor \n1144 his position. Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \n1155 B. Judicial Review of Discretionary DACA Termination After Advance \nNotice and an Opportunity to Respond is also Barred under 5 U.S.C. \n1166\n§ 701(a)(2).   \n1177\nThere is no judicial review under the APA of decisions that “courts traditionally \n1188\nhave regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n1199\n(1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). These decisions are typically unreviewable \n2200\nbecause there exists “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n2211\nexercise of discretion.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985). This bar applies \n2222\neven when “the agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.” \n2233\n                                                 \n2244 9 The Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), is misplaced. Dkt. No. \n31 at 7. Singh challenged ineffective assistance of counsel through habeas, and the court held that section \n2255\n1252(b)(9) did not apply because the challenge was not tied to removal proceedings. Singh, 499 F.3d at \n2266 978-79. To interpret Singh as permitting district court challenges such as those raised here runs counter to \nCongressional intent, and would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from the statute. See \n2277 Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (an APA claim \n“challeng[ing] the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably linked’ to the \n2288\norder of removal” must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n13 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1329   Page 23 of 30\n \n11 ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987) (“BLE”). The decisions \n22 committed to executive discretion include “an agency’s exercise of enforcement power,” \n33 including resource allocation and overall priorities. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. As there is \n44 “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in \n55 weighing these factors, an agency’s exercise of enforcement powers is “presumed \n66 immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” Id. at 830, 832.  \n77 Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” presumptively “rests entirely in \n88 [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) \n99 (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil enforcement action is generally \n1111 not open to judicial scrutiny. Considerations such as the Chaney factors are equally \n1122 present in enforcement decisions as in nonenforcement decisions. See Chaney, 470 U.S. \n1133 at 831; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-8 (1985) (“[T]he decision to \n1144 prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). \n1155 One form of that broad discretion is deferred action, a “discretionary and \nreversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek his removal for a \n1166\nspecific period of time. Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Like other \n1177\nagency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing \n1188\nof policy considerations that cannot serve as “meaningful standard against which to judge \n1199\nthe agency’s exercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The converse is equally \n2200\ntrue: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency discretion. See AADC, 525 \n2211\nU.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”). \n2222\nBecause “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in this \n2233\ncountry” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which \n2244\njudges may patrol its exercise.” Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) \n2255\n(INS’s decision not to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to \n2266\na group of aliens was non-justiciable). Thus, individual DACA terminations fall squarely \n2277\nwithin that category of agency discretion for which judicial review is improper. See \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n14 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1330   Page 24 of 30\n \n11 Chaney, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales, 824 F.3d at 822 (explaining that the exercise \n22 of prosecutorial discretion is different from other types of agency action). \n33 Here, Plaintiff is challenging DHS’s exercise of its enforcement power, including \n44 specifically the factors it relied on, and argues that instead of seeking to remove him from \n55 this country, DHS should decide to continue to defer action with respect to him. See, e.g., \n66 Dkt. No. 38 at ¶ 136 (“Mr. Gonzalez respectfully request[ed] that USCIS exercise its \n77 independent discretion in this case and continue its deferral of [his] removal.”); id. at ¶ 13 \n88 (“Defendants’ efforts to strip him of protection from removal from the only country he \n99 knows are unlawful and unconstitutional and must be set aside”). This is a classic \n1111 challenge to DHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. \n1122 There is no meaningful standard to judge whether DHS should continue to defer action as \n1133 to Plaintiff and, instead, prioritize the removal of other aliens. See id.10 Indeed, Plaintiff’s \n1144 tortured reading of the DACA SOP along with the Kelly Memo would render \n1155 meaningless the specific termination ground that continuation of deferred action is not \nconsistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities. See Dkt. No. 38 at ¶¶ 40-42. Rather, this \n1166\ntype of enforcement decision involves a balancing of factors, including factors as to how \n1177\nto allocate agency resources, that is committed to agency discretion by law. See Chaney, \n1188\n470 U.S. at 831; Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. The question for DHS was not whether it \n1199\ncould continue to exercise its discretion in favor of the Plaintiff, but rather whether it \n2200\nshould have under the circumstances of this case. Because this type of discretionary \n2211\ndetermination is committed to DHS by law, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review \n2222\nPlaintiff’s claims. \n2233\n2244                                                  \n10 It is irrelevant for this Court’s jurisdiction that DHS has guidance regarding grants of deferred action \n2255\nunder DACA. The existence of criteria that an agency is to consider is not enough to provide a meaningful \n2266 standard of review, see Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 659 (11th Cir. 1983), and, moreover, the exercise \nof prosecutorial discretion is not amenable to judicial review even when an agency has established \n2277 procedures. See Carranza, v. I.N.S., 277 F.3d 65, 72-3 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485, \n492 (8th Cir. 2001) (reversing a finding that a criminal defendant can force the Department of Justice to \n2288\ncomply with its death penalty protocol); Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607-8.  \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n15 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1331   Page 25 of 30\n \n11 Plaintiff can state no claim under the APA because USCIS’s Decision fully \n22 complied with its SOP and other policies, and the APA in general. First, USCIS’s \n33 Decision specifically quotes the SOP provision on which it is based. Dkt. No. 39-6 at \n44 195. Second, USCIS’s Decision demonstrates adherence to all the procedural steps in the \n55 cited SOP guidelines: consultation with ICE; consideration of whether continuing DACA \n66 is inconsistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities; and USCIS’s consideration of \n77 Plaintiff’s response and the agency’s voluntary consideration of his supplemental \n88 response to that NOIT.  Id. Following that review, USCIS found “that continuing to \n99 exercise prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against you is not consistent \n1111 with DHS’s enforcement priorities. Therefore USCIS does not find that you merit a \n1122 favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion and will not continue to defer DHS removal \n1133 action against you under DACA.” Id. at 3. \n1144 Plaintiff, without citation, attempts to reconstruct the DACA SOP to argue that: \n1155 “DACA recipients who meet the program’s objectively verifiable criteria—i.e., have no \ndisqualifying criminal convictions and do not pose a threat to national security or public \n1166\nsafety—remain ‘low priority cases.’” Dkt. No. 38 at ¶ 46. Plaintiff goes on to paraphrase \n1177\nthe various grounds for DACA termination discussed in the SOP, but omits the ground \n1188\napplied to him: “Enforcement Priority.” Id. at ¶¶ 54-60; see also Dkt. No. 39-4 at 79-81. \n1199\nNotably, this DACA termination provision was in the August 2013 version of the SOP, \n2200\nwell before the Kelly Memo issued in February 2017. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot \n2211\nsupport his claim that “deeming him an ‘enforcement priority’ would be counter to (or an \n2222\nunexplained reversal of) Defendants’ yearslong [sic] policy of categorizing individuals \n2233\nwho meet the DACA eligibility criteria as ‘low priority cases’ in the absence of \n2244\n‘disqualifying criminal offenses.’” Dkt. No. 38 at ¶ 141. While Defendants maintain that \n2255\nthe operative DACA SOP allows for a fluid definition of enforcement priorities and that \n2266\nnothing precludes Defendants from determining an individual is an enforcement priority \n2277\non a case-by-case basis, the Court need not even consider those arguments to find that \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n16 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1332   Page 26 of 30\n \n11 Plaintiff cannot succeed here because Plaintiff’s alleged role in an alien smuggling \n22 enterprise is clearly identified as an enforcement priority in USCIS’s 2011 NTA \n33 guidance. See Dkt. No. 39-4 at 62.  \n44 Plaintiff next argues that “ICE’s issuance of an NTA against him for nothing more \n55 than unlawful presence” is not “‘a reasoned basis for terminating DACA.’” Dkt. No. 38 \n66 at ¶ 143 (citing Inland Empire—Immigrant Youth Collective v. Duke, No. EDCV 17–\n77 2048, 2017 WL 5900061, at *6-7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (“IEIYC”)). While \n88 Defendants disagree with the court’s grant of a preliminary injunction in IEIYC, it \n99 followed the automatic termination of DACA based on NTA issuance alone, which is no \n1111 longer the case here. Moreover, Defendants’ Termination makes clear that it is based on \n1122 more than “ICE’s issuance of an NTA against him for nothing more than unlawful \n1133 presence.” Dkt. No. 38 at ¶ 143. Rather, USCIS stated: \n1144 USCIS does not rely solely on the ground listed in the charging document as \nit may not reflect all derogatory information and/or the assessment of whether \n1155\nor not you are considered an enforcement priority.  \n1166\nDkt. No. 39-6 at 196. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not and cannot demonstrate that \n1177\nDefendants have ignored their own DACA termination policy.11 \n1188\n1199\n                                                 \n11 Plaintiff also appears to argue that the DACA SOP requires a criminal conviction to support DACA \n2200\ntermination, whereas the Kelly Memo prioritizes charged or suspected criminal conduct. Dkt. No. 39-1 \n2211 at 20, citing Dkt. No. 39-6 at 208. However, even the provision that Plaintiff cites only supports a \nrequirement that USCIS adjudicators investigate beyond a RAP sheet to ascertain whether a DACA \n2222\nrequestor has actually been convicted of a crime. Id. Notably the same SOP provision that Plaintiff cites \n2233 indicates that certain criminal conduct may render an individual “not eligible for consideration of \nDACA,” but states that “the requestor’s entire offense history can be considered along with other facts \n2244 to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, he/she warrants an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion.” Id. at 204. Ultimately, the DACA SOP is silent as to the factors USCIS is to \n2255\nuse in DACA termination decisions where an individual is determined to be an enforcement priority, and \n2266 the DACA SOP and related guidance support that DACA may be terminated on a discretionary case-by-\ncase basis even where a DACA recipient otherwise meets the guidelines. Dkt. No. 39-4 at 81; id. at 11 \n2277 (“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated at any time, \nwith or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”). \n2288\n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n17 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1333   Page 27 of 30\n \n11   Indeed, Plaintiff’s arguments make clear that he is not challenging the process by \n22 which USCIS terminated his DACA, but he is instead challenging USCIS’s ultimate \n33 decision of how to exercise its discretion – an action for which this Court lacks \n44 jurisdiction. Plaintiff’s arbitrary and capricious analysis suffers from the same flaw as his \n55 argument about Defendants’ compliance with the SOP – he concludes that “the automatic \n66 termination of his DACA status and EAD failed to adhere to the DACA SOP and USCIS \n77 Memo” Dkt. No. 38 at ¶ 17 [of Count Four],12 but offers no cogent explanation why \n88 USCIS’s Termination fails in this regard. Indeed, Plaintiff again states, without citation, \n99 that Defendants “decision to label Mr. Gonzalez an “enforcement priority” even though \n1111 he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime is a violation of the DACA \n1122 program’s non-prioritization of immigrants without any criminal history and the APA’s \n1133 proscriptions against arbitrary and capricious action and unexplained policy \n1144 changes” Id. at ¶  10. However, where Plaintiff has not and cannot demonstrate that \n1155 Defendants’ discretion to determine that he is an enforcement priority is constrained by \nhis lack of a conviction or public safety concern, his argument fails. \n1166\n1177 C. Plaintiff Cannot State a Constitutional Claim because the Termination of \nDACA and Employment Authorization does not Implicate a Constitutional \n1188\nInterest. \n1199\nPlaintiffs cannot have a protected constitutional interest in DACA because it purely \n2200\ndiscretionary.  See, e.g., Velasco-Gutierrez v. Crossland, 732 F.2d 792, 798 (10th Cir. \n2211\n1984) (holding that deferred action guidance “places no effective limitations on official \n2222\ndiscretion, and thus creates no protected liberty interest in deferred action”); cf. Arpaio, \n2233\n797 F.3d at 17 (quoting DACA Memo for the proposition that “deferred action remains \n2244\ndiscretionary and reversible, and ‘confers no substantive right, immigration status or \n2255\npathway to citizenship.’”). \n2266\n2277\n                                                 \n2288 12 Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint restarts paragraph numbering with paragraph 1 under Count Three on \npage 39, following paragraph 173 under Count Two. See Dkt. No. 38. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1334   Page 28 of 30\n \n11 The Supreme Court has held that, for due process purposes, a benefit “is not a \n22 protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it in their \n33 discretion.” Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756. For Due Process purposes, statutes or \n44 regulations limit discretion only when they contain “‘explicitly mandatory language’”—\n55 i.e., “specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations’ substantive \n66 predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow.” Ky. Dep’t of Corrs. v. \n77 Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462–63 (1989) (citation omitted). Nor does the provision of \n88 certain procedures by an agency itself give rise to a federal constitutional dimension. See, \n99 e.g., Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51 (1983) (“[a] liberty interest . . . cannot be \n1111 the right to demand needless formality. Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional \n1122 purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim \n1133 of entitlement.”).  \n1144 Neither the constitution nor Congress provides an individual in unlawful status a \n1155 protected interest in family reunification, living or working in the United States, or in \ndiscretionary relief from removal. See De Mercado v. Mukasey, 566 F.3d 810, 816 (9th \n1166\nCir. 2009). Garcia v. Holder, No., 07-60271, 320 F. App’x 288, 290 (9th Cir. April 9, \n1177\n2009); Pilapil v. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970), cert denied, 400 U.S. 908 (1970).13 \n1188\nNor can Plaintiff claim an entitlement in this case that creates a Constitutional interest. \n1199\n“To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract \n2200\nneed or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, \n2211\ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & \n2222\nRehab., 727 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. \n2233\nRoth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)); see also Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 \n2244\n(9th Cir. 2016) (underscoring that aliens cannot claim a cognizable due process interest in \n2255\ndiscretionary immigration relief or benefits). Even a practice of “generously” granting a \n2266\n2277                                                  \n13 While Plaintiff cites Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), to discuss “other enduring \n2288\nattachments of life,” the extensions that Plaintiff argues for here conflict with the cited rulings. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n19 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 49-1   Filed 02/23/18   PageID.1335   Page 29 of 30\n \n11 “wholly and expressly discretionary state privilege” does not create a legal entitlement to \n22 that benefit. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec. \n33 (“Regents”), No. C 17-05211 WHA, 2018 WL 339144, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2018) \n44 (citing Gerhart v.

The policy is codified in no statute or \n1122 regulation.15 Its source—the DACA Memo—describes it as a “policy” for the “exercise of \n1133 prosecutorial discretion.” Dkt. No. 39-4 at 3; see Omar v. McHugh, 646 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. \n1144 Cir. 2011) (the “use of the word ‘policy’”—“rather than a word such as ‘right’—\n1155 reinforces the conclusion that Congress did not intend to create an ‘entitlement’”). And \nthe agency’s public guidance makes clear that, under DACA, deferred action “may be \n1166\nterminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \n1177\ndiscretion.” Dkt. No. 39-4 at 5; see also Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 17 (noting that the grant of \n1188\ndeferred action is discretionary).  \n1199\n2200\n                                                 \n14 Plaintiff’s reliance in his motion for preliminary injunction on cases that discuss violations of non-\n2211\ndiscretionary procedures in agency regulations are inapposite where deferred action and related \n2222 employment authorization are discretionary concepts not tied to statute or regulation. See Dkt. No. 39-1 \nat 24-25 (citing United States v. Raya-Vaca, 771 F.3d 1195, 1203 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2014) (liberty interest \n2233\narising from risk of removal on an expedited removal order, not the loss of something conferred by a \ndiscretionary policy)); Trinidad y Garcia v.

Pursuant to Local Rules\n4 7.1(a) and 7.1(e)(5), Mr. Gonzalez respectfully requests waiver of the 28-day\n5 notice of motion requirement, and an expedited hearing prior to October 2017. Mr.\n6 Gonzalez respectfully requests oral argument (in person or telephonically,\n7 consistent with Local Rule 7.1(d)). Proposed orders have been properly submitted,\n8 and Defendants are on notice. Mr. Gonzalez also requests that no fewer than seven\n9 calendar days prior to the Court’s oral argument date, Defendants produce the\n10 USCIS record upon which the determination to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s Deferred\n11 Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) status and employment authorization\n12 was made.\n13 For the reasons described below and set forth more fully in Mr. Gonzalez’s\n14 accompanying Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Memorandum of\n15 Points and Authorities, Declaration, Declaration of John C. Ulin, and exhibits\n16 thereto, Mr. Gonzalez respectfully requests that this Court issue a temporary\n17 restraining order and/or preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining Defendants’\n18 revocation of his DACA status and employment authorization, in order for\n19 Defendants to provide Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA, an\n20 opportunity to respond, and the opportunity to file a timely DACA renewal\n21 application in advance of the October 5, 2017 deadline that Defendants imposed on\n22 September 5, 2017. These procedures are mandated by Defendants’ internal\n23 DACA policies and procedural due process.\n24 Good cause exists for this Court to waive the 28-day notice requirement and\n25 hold an expedited hearing. On September 5, 2017, Defendant Department of\n26 Homeland Security (“DHS”) declared that Defendant United States Citizenship\n27 and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) will (1) stop processing any new DACA\n28 applications permanently, and (2) will not process any renewal DACA applications\n1\nPLAINTIFF’SEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARYRESTRAININGORDERAND/OR\nPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION;APPLICATIONFORORDERSHORTENINGTIMEANDEXPEDITED\nHEARINGPRIORTOOCTOBER2017\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 2   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.210   Page 3 of 6\n1 filed after October 5, 2017 (for those whose DACA status expires before March 5,\n2 2018). Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status (originally set to expire on December 22,\n3 2017) was unlawfully revoked. He seeks this Court’s temporary restoration so that\n4 he may apply for renewal. See Coyotl v. Kelly, 2017 WL 2889681, at *13 (N.D.\n5 Ga. June 12, 2017) (ordering reinstatement of DACA status pending the\n6 Government’s adjudication consistent with the DACA Standard Operating\n7 Procedures).\n8 As set forth more fully in Mr. Gonzalez’s accompanying Memorandum of\n9 Points and Authorities, he satisfies each required element for a temporary\n10 restraining order and/or preliminary injunction:\n11 1. Mr. Gonzalez is likely to succeed on his claim that USCIS’s automatic\n12 termination of his DACA status was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n13 and violated DHS’s DACA National Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA\n14 SOP”) and USCIS’s November 7, 2011 Policy Memorandum. USCIS revoked Mr.\n15 Gonzalez’s “lawful presence,” employment authorization, and other attendant\n16 benefits (including the right to leave the country and lawfully return under certain\n17 circumstances)—without any notice, opportunity to be heard, or opportunity to\n18 appeal—simultaneous to Customs and Border Protection’s (“CBP”) charge that\n19 Mr. Gonzalez was unlawfully present in the United States. That is the height of\n20 arbitrary agency action. Because DACA status confers “lawful presence,” such an\n21 automatic termination was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. It was\n22 in violation of the DACA SOP, which requires a Notice of Intent to Terminate and\n23 thirty-three days to respond before DACA termination. USCIS’s automatic\n24 termination violated Mr. Gonzalez’s Fifth Amendment Procedural Due Process\n25 rights by depriving him of liberty and property interests without any notice.\n26 2. Mr. Gonzalez is suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm\n27 as a result of Defendants’ unlawful termination of his DACA status and\n28 employment authorization. Because of that unlawful termination, Mr. Gonzalez\n2\nPLAINTIFF’SEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARYRESTRAININGORDERAND/OR\nPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION;APPLICATIONFORORDERSHORTENINGTIMEANDEXPEDITED\nHEARINGPRIORTOOCTOBER2017\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 2   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.211   Page 4 of 6\n1 has been stripped of “lawful presence” in the United States and was forced to leave\n2 his lawful employment in the airline industry. He has been barred from lawful\n3 employment for over a year, despite his former employer’s assurance that it would\n4 welcome his reapplication upon restoration of his right to work. With DHS’s\n5 September 5, 2017 decision to stop accepting DACA renewal applications after\n6 October 5, 2017, Mr. Gonzalez is at a highly elevated risk of irreparable harm:\n7 Unless Defendants’ unlawful termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status is\n8 enjoined (in order to provide Mr. Gonzalez notice and an opportunity to respond),\n9 Mr. Gonzalez will be precluded from submitting a DACA renewal application\n10 because of USCIS’s own previous unlawful action.\n11 3. The balance of hardships tips heavily in Mr. Gonzalez’s favor, and the\n12 public interest is not served by countenancing Defendants’ unlawful and arbitrary\n13 stripping of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment authorization. The\n14 Government stands to lose nothing (and never stood to lose anything) by providing\n15 Mr. Gonzalez notice and an opportunity to respond before terminating his DACA\n16 status in accordance with its own guidelines and policies and basic principles of\n17 procedural due process. Mr. Gonzalez was released from immigration detention\n18 fifteen months ago and has never been charged with a crime or further investigated\n19 in connection with the events that led to his detention. He was twice granted\n20 DACA status after affirmative determinations by the Government that he had a\n21 spotless criminal record and that he otherwise posed no public safety threat. Since\n22 being released from immigration detention, Mr. Gonzalez has resumed his place as\n23 a model member of his family and community. In short, there is no reason to\n24 maintain the unlawful revocation of his lawful presence in this country and\n25 deprivation of his right to work and pay taxes, as he did for nearly three years as a\n26 law-abiding DACA recipient. DHS’s artificial and arbitrary October 5, 2017\n27 deadline for DACA renewal applications only makes the need to undo Defendants’\n28 unlawful actions all the more pressing.\n3\nPLAINTIFF’SEXPARTEEMERGENCYMOTIONFORTEMPORARYRESTRAININGORDERAND/OR\nPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION;APPLICATIONFORORDERSHORTENINGTIMEANDEXPEDITED\nHEARINGPRIORTOOCTOBER2017\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 2   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.212   Page 5 of 6\n1 In pursuit of the relief sought here and for purposes of Defendants’\n2 subsequent lawful adjudication of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA termination and renewal,\n3 Mr. Gonzalez requests that Defendants immediately present all relevant\n4 documents, including but not limited to Mr. Gonzalez’s “A-file” and the entirety of\n5 the USCIS record upon which the decision to automatically terminate Mr.\n6 Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment authorization was based. See Portland\n7 Audubon Soc. v. Endangered Species Committee, 984 F.2d 1534, 1548 (9th Cir.\n8 1993) (“Section 706 of the APA provides that judicial review of agency action\n9 shall be based on ‘the whole record,’” which “includes everything that was before\n10 the agency pertaining to the merits of its decision.”). Mr. Gonzalez has a right to\n11 review the agency record that formed the basis of Defendants’ actions, for which\n12 Defendants must “articulate a satisfactory explanation,” including a “rational\n13 connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\n14 Assoc. of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).\n15 Mr. Gonzalez submitted a FOIA request for these documents to Defendant\n16 USCIS on July 19, 2017. In nearly two months, USCIS has failed to produce\n17 anything or explain the reasons for delay of this simple request. Mr. Gonzalez\n18 respectfully requests that the Court order Defendants to produce these documents\n19 no fewer than seven calendar days prior to the Court’s oral argument date. Mr.\n20 Gonzalez’s request is narrow, simple, in pursuit of his statutory and constitutional\n21 rights, and does not place any undue burden on Defendants, who have been on\n22 notice of this request for nearly two months. See Smagin v. Yegiazaryan, 2015 WL\n23 12762270, at *2 (C.D.

No. 26. This is the \n44 second time Plaintiff has attempted to present an argument to the Court in a matter that \n55 serves an improper purpose and by which Defendants would not have the opportunity to \n66 respond.1 \n77   Plaintiff’s ex parte application improperly seeks to present the Court with one \n88 newly published news article, a second older article that Plaintiff has not previously cited, \n99 as well as letter briefing that contains arguments far in excess of the new article on which \n1111 Plaintiff bases his ex parte application.  \n1122 In the analogous context of Rule 28(j) letters submitted pursuant to the Fed. R. \n1133 App. P., arguments raised for the first time in such supplemental authority are deemed \n1144 waived. Pawlyk v. Wood, 248 F.3d 815, 822 n.5 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). Here, \n1155 Plaintiff seeks to respond directly to concerns raised by the Court during the December \n12, 2017, hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to modify this Court’s September 29, 2017, \n1166\nOrder. See Dkt. No. 26-2 at 2 (“we write briefly to address a few of the concerns that \n1177\nYour Honor raised at Tuesday’s hearing”); (“this Court is right to be concerned about the \n1188\npotential for grievous adverse consequences for Mr. Gonzalez once his DACA status is \n1199\nterminated or expires . . .”); id. at 3 (responding to the Court’s suggestion at hearing “that \n2200\nsuch further order might be a ‘ministerial act,’ by arguing “that it would be anything but \n2211\nministerial.”); (“the risk of non-compliance is increased by the unusual pace at which \n2222\nDefendants seek to adjudicate his NOIT and renewal application.”). These issues were \n2233\nraised by the Court during the course of a ninety minute hearing on Plaintiff’s motion \n2244\nwhere the Court acknowledged that it was inquiring and informing itself about issues that \n2255\n                                                 \n2266\n1 Plaintiff’s ex parte application also violates Local Rule 83.3(g), in that Plaintiff allowed \n2277\nonly thirteen minutes to elapse between his counsel’s message regarding the intended ex \n2288 parte application and filing with this Court. \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 27   Filed 12/15/17   PageID.799   Page 3 of 4\n \n11 were not squarely before the Court in Plaintiff’s motion. These issues appear to have \n22 been raised by the Court sua sponte, and Plaintiff does not and cannot point to prior \n33 briefing on these issues.2 For this reason alone, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s ex parte \n44 application. The Court should also deny Plaintiff’s ex parte application to the extent it \n55 submits, discusses, and argues an eight month old article from April 17, 2017, that \n66 Plaintiff appears to have never cited in this matter. See Dkt. No. 26-4. \n77 The Court should deny Plaintiff’s ex parte application not only because Plaintiff’s \n88 argument regarding the newly cited article exceeds the scope of Plaintiff’s prior \n99 arguments, and the newly alleged harms are not related to the issues before the Court in \n1111 Plaintiff’s complaint and the Court’s September 29, 2017, Order, but also because the \n1122 new article fails to meet the legal standard for judicial notice. Taking judicial notice of \n1133 publications is not appropriate with respect to “whether the contents of those articles \n1144 were in fact true.” Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 F.3d 954, \n1155 960 (9th Cir. 2010). “This is because often, the accuracy of information in newspaper \narticles and press releases cannot be readily determined and/or can be reasonably \n1166\nquestioned.” Gerritsen v. Warner Bros. Entm’t Inc., 112 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1028 (C.D. \n1177\nCal. 2015), citing Fed. R. Evid. 201.  \n1188\nWere the Court to consider the newly cited article for its truth, the Court should \n1199\nalso consider the further development in Mr. Enriquez’s case that ICE has moved to \n2200\n2211                                                  \n2 With regard to the merits of Plaintiff’s new arguments, these arguments are based on \n2222\nPlaintiff’s same misconceptions regarding the claims in his complaint and this Court’s \n2233 September 29, 2017 Order, and Defendants’ response from prior briefing is unchanged. \nSee Dkt. No. 23-2 at 8 (“Not only are these challenges premature, they are also distinct \n2244\nfrom the challenge raised in Plaintiff’s complaint to the automatic termination of his DACA \n2255 based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s NTA.”); Dkt. No. 18 at 1 (“Plaintiff has \nnever stated a claim regarding his now pending DACA renewal request or the procedures \n2266\nregarding  the  adjudication  of  that  request.”);  id.  at  3  (“Plaintiff  necessarily  did  not \n2277\nchallenge a then nonexistent administrative action in his complaint, nor does Plaintiff \n2288 challenge Defendants’ procedures regarding DACA renewal requests.”). \n \n \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 27   Filed 12/15/17   PageID.800   Page 4 of 4\n \n11 dismiss the Notice to Appear as improvidently issued. See Exhibit 1. Moreover, the \n22 harms Plaintiff asserts regarding Mr. Enriquez at the time of his arrest are different from \n33 any harm Plaintiff could assert because Plaintiff is already subject to removal \n44 proceedings.3 Accordingly, even if the Court considers the article regarding Mr. \n55 Enriquez’s case, it fails to supports Plaintiff’s new arguments regarding hypothetical \n66 injuries.  \n77 For the above stated reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s ex parte application. \n88 Dated: December 15, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n \n99\nCHAD A.

Miller, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\n5 California, located at 221 West Broadway, Courtroom 5D, San Diego, CA 92101,\n6 Plaintiff Alberto Luciano Gonzalez Torres will and hereby does move to modify\n7 the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n8 [Docket No. 12].\n9 The Court’s Order reinstated Mr. Gonzalez’s Deferred Action for Childhood\n10 Arrivals (“DACA”) status and attendant employment authorization; enjoined\n11 Defendants from enforcing their unlawful revocation of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n12 status and employment authorization; and required Defendants to accept Mr.\n13 Gonzalez’s DACA and employment authorization renewal application. The Order\n14 requires Defendants to fully comply with the DACA Standard Operating\n15 Procedures (“SOP”) in adjudicating Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status. Following the\n16 Court’s Order, Mr. Gonzalez submitted a timely renewal application, which\n17 remains pending before Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration\n18 Services. His current DACA status and employment authorization will expire on\n19 December 22, 2017.\n20 According to Defendants’ public guidance, DACA renewal applications may\n21 remain pending for several months (120 to 150 days from the date of submission).\n22 The only reason Mr. Gonzalez did not and could not apply for renewal well in\n23 advance of his December 22 expiration date was by virtue of Defendants’ unlawful\n24 revocation of his DACA status and employment authorization. Therefore, Mr.\n25 Gonzalez respectfully requests that the Court modify its Order to ensure that Mr.\n26 Gonzalez retains his DACA status and employment authorization as long as his\n27 renewal application remains pending, including any time to respond to a Notice of\n28 Intent to Deny his application, and/or during the course of any litigation stemming\n1\nPLAINTIFF’SNOTICEOFMOTIONANDMOTIONTOMODIFY\nORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.576   Page 3 of 4\n1 from Defendants’ denial of his application to ensure full compliance with the\n2 DACA SOP and all other applicable laws and guidelines.

INTRODUCTION\n2 Plaintiff Alberto Luciano Gonzalez Torres (“Mr. Gonzalez”) seeks a\n3 modification of the Court’s September 29, 2017 Order granting his motion for a\n4 preliminary injunction. Mr. Gonzalez’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\n5 (“DACA”) status and attendant employment authorization (collectively, “DACA\n6 status”) are set to expire on December 22, 2017. Had Defendants not unlawfully\n7 revoked Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status, he would have applied for renewal well in\n8 advance of his expiration date. But he was barred from applying for renewal until\n9 this Court restored his DACA status, and Defendants’ adjudication of his renewal\n10 application may stretch well beyond his expiration date. The Court should\n11 therefore enjoin the expiration of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and employment\n12 authorization pending final resolution of his renewal application, including any\n13 time to respond to a Notice of Intent to Deny his application, and/or the litigation\n14 of any denial of his application to ensure full compliance with the DACA Standard\n15 Operating Procedures (“SOP”) and all other applicable laws and guidelines.\n16 II. BACKGROUND\n17 On September 29, 2017, the Court granted Mr. Gonzalez’s motion for a\n18 preliminary injunction, “enjoin[ing] the revocation of the legal status he obtained\n19 through the [DACA] program in order to permit him to apply for an extension of\n20 his DACA status.” Dkt. 12 at 1. The Court ordered Defendants to “accept\n21 Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application” and “preliminarily enjoined [Defendants]\n22 from terminating Plaintiff’s employment authorization” “pending further Order of\n23 this Court.” Id. at 13-14. The Court further ordered that “Defendants shall fully\n24 comply with the DACA SOP should Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s\n25 DACA status.” Id. at 13.\n26 In reaching its decision, the Court held that Mr. Gonzalez “has made a\n27 strong showing that he is likely to prevail on his APA claim that Defendants acted\n28 arbitrarily, capriciously, and abused their discretion” in revoking his DACA status\n1\nPLAINTIFF’SMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINSUPPORTOF\nMOTIONTOMODIFYORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13-1   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.580   Page 3 of 8\n1 without following the DACA SOP. Id. at 11-12. The Court “categorically\n2 reject[ed]” Defendants’ position that they had not acted unlawfully. Id. at 10.\n3 The Court also held that Defendants’ unlawful revocation of Mr. Gonzalez’s\n4 DACA status caused him ongoing irreparable harm, in the form of a “constant\n5 threat of apprehension” and the “deprivation of employment.” Id. at 12.\n6 Mr. Gonzalez submitted a timely DACA renewal application on October 4.\n7 It remains pending before Defendant USCIS. Mr. Gonzalez’s “myUSCIS Case\n8 Status” webpage indicates that “[a]s of October 25, 2017, [USCIS] is actively\n9 reviewing” his application. See Declaration of John C. Ulin (filed concurrently),\n10 Ex. A (last visited Nov. 13, 2017). It does not indicate how soon Mr. Gonzalez\n11 may expect action in his case. However, USCIS has long urged DACA recipients\n12 to apply for renewal 150 to 120 days in advance of their expiration dates to ensure\n13 that their DACA status did not lapse during adjudication. See Dkt. 2-11 at 16, Ulin\n14 Dec., Ex. H, DACA FAQ, Q49 (“USCIS strongly encourages you to submit your\n15 [DACA] renewal request between 150 days and 120 days before the expiration\n16 date located on your current . . . DACA approval notice and Employment\n17 Authorization Document (EAD).”); id. (“USCIS’ current goal is to process DACA\n18 renewal requests within 120 days.”). 120 days from October 4, 2017 is February 1,\n19 2018, nearly a month and a half after Mr. Gonzalez’s current DACA status (and\n20 right to work) expires.\n21 Were it not for Defendants’ unlawful revocation of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n22 status, he would have submitted his DACA renewal application well in advance of\n23 his current expiration date. Indeed, when Mr. Gonzalez renewed his DACA status\n24 in 2014, he did so with over three months to spare, resulting in a renewal that\n25 started a month before his initial DACA status even expired. See Dkt. 2-19,\n26 Gonzalez Dec. ¶ 4 (explaining that Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status was renewed on\n27 December 24, 2014, approximately a month before his initial status would have\n28 expired on January 21, 2015).\n2\nPLAINTIFF’SMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINSUPPORTOF\nMOTIONTOMODIFYORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13-1   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.581   Page 4 of 8\n1 III. ARGUMENT\n2 A. THE COURT HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO MODIFY THE\nTERMS OF ITS EQUITABLE RELIEF IN LIGHT OF THE\n3 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE\n4 The Court should exercise its “wide discretion” to modify the precise terms\n5 of its injunction. System Federation No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 648 (1961);\n6 see Taheny v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2011 WL 864678, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 10,\n7 2011) (“Courts issuing injunctions have inherent power to modify them.”).\n8 Modification of an injunction is appropriate as part of the Court’s “continuing\n9 supervision [and] continuing willingness to apply its powers and processes on\n10 behalf of the party who obtained that equitable relief.” System Federation, 364\n11 U.S. at 647; accord State v. Trump, 871 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir. 2017) (“The\n12 district court has the power to supervise compliance with an injunction and to\n13 ‘modify a preliminary injunction in consideration of new facts.’”) (quoting A&M\n14 Records Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 284 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2002)). Modification\n15 may also be necessary to “describe in reasonable detail . . . the act or acts\n16 restrained or required.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C).\n17 The Court “should not hesitate to modify its injunction” as part of its “equity\n18 jurisdiction” as required by the circumstances of a given case. U.S. v. Washington,\n19 853 F.3d 946, 979 (9th Cir. 2017). As part of this continuing supervision,\n20 modification is appropriate when necessary to “achieve the purposes” of an\n21 injunction. U.S. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 249 (1968). The\n22 prevailing party “can request modification in the future to add, upon competent\n23 proof, specific other terms” to the injunction. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v.\n24 Fung, 710 F.3d 1020, 1048 (9th Cir. 2013).\n25\n26\n27\n28\n3\nPLAINTIFF’SMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINSUPPORTOF\nMOTIONTOMODIFYORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13-1   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.582   Page 5 of 8\n1 B. MR. GONZALEZ HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NECESSITY\nAND PROPRIETY OF A MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS\n2 OF THE COURT’S INJUNCTION\n3 In accordance with these principles, Mr. Gonzalez is entitled to a\n4 modification of the terms of the Court’s injunction. The Court should enter a\n5 modified order extending his DACA status until either (1) USCIS approves or\n6 denies his renewal application, including during the 33-day period provided by the\n7 DACA SOP to respond to a Notice of Intent to Deny, and/or (2) until the resolution\n8 of any litigation to ensure full compliance with the DACA SOP and all other\n9 applicable laws and guidelines in the event that USCIS denies his renewal\n10 application.\n11 The Court has already determined that Defendants revoked Mr. Gonzalez’s\n12 DACA status unlawfully. And Mr. Gonzalez’s past behavior indicates that he\n13 otherwise would have submitted a timely renewal application and prevented the\n14 lapse of his DACA status upon its December 22, 2017 expiration—had he not been\n15 denied the right to apply for renewal prior to this Court’s September 29 Order.\n16 Therefore, to achieve the purposes of the Court’s injunction—i.e., to remedy the\n17 irreparable harm suffered by Mr. Gonzalez as a result of Defendants’ unlawful\n18 revocation and to provide him a fair adjudication of his renewal application—the\n19 Court should modify its injunction.\n20 Defendants’ adjudication of Mr. Gonzalez’s renewal application may, by the\n21 terms of USCIS’s own public guidance, stretch into February 2018 or beyond.\n22 This would unjustly strip Mr. Gonzalez of his DACA status and employment\n23 authorization, leaving him in fear of apprehension and unable to work and provide\n24 for himself. Such an outcome would defeat the purpose of the Court’s injunction,\n25 which is to undo the effects of Defendants’ unlawful revocation of his DACA\n26 status. As the Court has already held:\n27 Plaintiff will suffer significant irreparable harm in the\nabsence of an injunction by losing his DACA status . . . .\n28 The potential harm caused by Defendants’ conduct\n4\nPLAINTIFF’SMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINSUPPORTOF\nMOTIONTOMODIFYORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13-1   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.583   Page 6 of 8\nincludes the loss of employment, a core benefit under\n1 DACA. The deprivation of employment impacts\nPlaintiff’s ability to financially provide for himself and\n2 his family. The loss of DACA status also undermines\none’s sense of well-being and subjects Plaintiff to a\n3 constant threat of apprehension and possible removal\nfrom the only country he has called home. This\n4 threatened harm far exceeds any harm suffered by the\ngovernment.\n5\n6 Dkt. 12 at 12. In short, allowing Mr. Gonzalez’s lawful presence and employment\n7 authorization to lapse merely because he was barred from applying for renewal\n8 early—i.e., as a direct result of Defendants’ unlawful revocation of his DACA\n9 status—would cause him the same irreparable harm as the revocation in the first\n10 instance and would defeat the purpose of the Court’s injunction.\n11 IV. CONCLUSION\n12 Mr. Gonzalez respectfully requests that the Court modify its September 29,\n13 2017 Order to make clear that Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status will remain in effect\n14 pending final resolution of his renewal application, including the 33-day period\n15 provided by the DACA SOP to respond to a Notice of Intent to Deny his\n16 application, and/or the litigation of a denial of his application to ensure\n17 Defendants’ full compliance with the DACA SOP and all other applicable laws\n18 and guidelines. See Coyotl v. Duke, No. 1:17-CV-1670-MHC, Dkt. 54, Order\n19 (Oct. 26, 2017) (Declaration of John C. Ulin (filed concurrently), Ex. B) (upon\n20 defendants’ denial of plaintiff’s DACA renewal application and motion to dissolve\n21 preliminary injunction, court ordering that “Plaintiff’s DACA and employment\n22 authorization shall remain in effect . . . until further Order from this Court, which\n23 will issue only after Defendants have submitted sufficient proof that they have\n24 followed all relevant standard operating procedures regarding the adjudication of\n25 Plaintiff’s renewal application and any termination of Plaintiff’s DACA status.”).\n26\n27\n28\n5\nPLAINTIFF’SMEMORANDUMOFPOINTSANDAUTHORITIESINSUPPORTOF\nMOTIONTOMODIFYORDERGRANTINGMOTIONFORPRELIMINARYINJUNCTION\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 13-1   Filed 11/13/17   PageID.584   Page 7 of 8\nDated: November 13, 2017 Respectfully submitted,\n1\n2 /s/ John C.

DACA status made him\n5 “lawfully present” in the United States for its duration.\n6 For the reasons set forth below, Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that\n7 Defendants’1 “automatic” termination of his DACA status (and attendant\n8 employment authorization and other benefits)—without notice, opportunity to\n9 contest, or opportunity to appeal—simultaneous to CBP’s issuance of a Notice to\n10 Appear (“NTA”) charging nothing more than unlawful presence in the United\n11 States:\n12 (1) failed to adhere to the mandatory agency guidelines and policies set forth\n13 in DHS’s DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOP”);\n14 (2) was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, in violation of the\n15 Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”); and\n16 (3) violated Mr. Gonzalez’s Fifth Amendment Procedural Due Process\n17 rights.\n18 In each of these ways, the termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status\n19 violated the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and must be declared unlawful and set aside.\n20 Mr. Gonzalez seeks an order restoring his DACA status and employment\n21 authorization while the Government provides him adequate notice of its intent to\n22 terminate his benefits, a reasoned basis for its decision, and an opportunity to\n23 respond with arguments and evidence demonstrating his continued DACA\n24 eligibility and that he merits the Government’s continued favorable exercise of\n25 deferred action.\n26\n27 1 Defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), U.S. Citizenship\nand Immigration Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n28\n(“ICE”), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) are referred to\ncollectively as “the Government” unless addressed specifically.\n1\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.3   Page 3 of 29\n1 INTRODUCTION\n2 Mr. Gonzalez was born in Mexico and brought to the United States at\n3 approximately 8 years old—16 years ago. Since that time, he has never left\n4 California, has no criminal history, and has been a productive member of his San\n5 Diego community.\n6 Mr. Gonzalez attended elementary and middle school in San Diego, where\n7 he graduated on time from high school in 2011. In January 2013, the Government\n8 granted him permission to live and work in the United States pursuant to its DACA\n9 program. The Government renewed Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status in December\n10 2014 until December 22, 2017. Both times, he was subject to the Government’s\n11 rigorous biographic and biometric background checks, and paid $495 fees.\n12 Prior to receiving DACA status, during the period from 2011 to 2013, Mr.\n13 Gonzalez was unable to secure employment because he was unwilling to\n14 misrepresent his immigration status. But thanks to his DACA-related employment\n15 authorization, Mr. Gonzalez quickly found lawful employment with an airline\n16 supply company in 2013. He was tasked with stocking food and supplies on\n17 commercial flights for American Airlines. In addition to the rigorous vetting\n18 process he had undergone to obtain—and then renew—his DACA status and\n19 employment authorization, Mr. Gonzalez’s airline industry job required him to\n20 meet strict security protocols, including background checks and drug tests. He\n21 passed them all.\n22 On May 6, 2016, Mr. Gonzalez was detained by immigration officers while\n23 dog-sitting at a house where CBP later alleged that undocumented immigrants\n24 were present. The very next day, CBP issued him a Notice to Appear. The NTA’s\n25 sole charge was unlawful presence in the United States under Section 212 of the\n26 Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”). See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)\n27 (“present in the United States without being admitted or paroled”). The NTA did\n28 not allege any other criminal or unlawful activity.\n2\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.4   Page 4 of 29\n1 After two days of questioning, Mr. Gonzalez was virtually ignored for nearly\n2 a month in immigration detention. Border Patrol officers apparently lost interest in\n3 him and concluded that he was not involved in whatever events they were\n4 investigating. Ultimately, an Immigration Judge ordered Mr. Gonzalez released on\n5 a bond of only $5,000, after finding that he did not pose a threat to public safety.\n6 DHS did not appeal. Since being released over 15 months ago, he has resumed\n7 being a productive member of his family and San Diego community—though\n8 stripped of his right to lawful employment. To this day, Mr. Gonzalez has never\n9 been criminally charged or questioned again by any law enforcement agency or\n10 officer in connection with the events of May 6, 2016. He has appeared at every\n11 Immigration Court proceeding pursuant to his NTA.\n12 On May 23, 2016, USCIS issued Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Action,\n13 informing him that: “On May 7, 2016, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n14 issued you a Notice to Appear (NTA). USCIS is notifying you that your deferred\n15 action as a childhood arrival and your employment authorization terminated\n16 automatically as of the date your NTA [for unlawful presence] was issued.”\n17 Mr. Gonzalez was a valued employee and productive member of the San\n18 Diego community until his DACA status and employment authorization were\n19 stripped pursuant to a Government “policy” that did not provide him any notice,\n20 opportunity to contest, or opportunity to appeal. Upon his release from detention,\n21 Mr. Gonzalez voluntarily informed his employer of his loss of employment\n22 authorization. He had to be let go, but the employer asked him to reapply when he\n23 regained the right to work.\n24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n25 1. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n26 2. This Court has remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment\n27 Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.\n28\n3\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.5   Page 5 of 29\n1 3. Venue is proper in the Southern District of California because a\n2 substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this\n3 District. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).\n4 PARTIES\n5 4. Mr. Gonzalez is a 24-year-old resident of San Diego, California. He\n6 was born in Mexico and brought to the United States in or around 2001, when he\n7 was approximately 8 years old. Pursuant to its DACA program, the United States\n8 Government twice conferred on Mr. Gonzalez the right to live and work in this\n9 country—for set periods subject to renewal—after lengthy application processes,\n10 rigorous security vetting, and substantial fee payments. In May 2016, the\n11 Government terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status, employment authorization,\n12 and attendant benefits without providing him prior notice of its intent to terminate\n13 or an opportunity to be heard.\n14 5. DHS is a cabinet department of the United States federal government\n15 with responsibility for, among other things, administering and enforcing the\n16 nation’s immigration laws. Its stated mission is to “safeguard the American\n17 people, our homeland, and our values.” U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\n18 “Our Mission.”2\n19 6. USCIS is a federal agency within DHS “that oversees lawful\n20 immigration to the United States.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,\n21 “About Us.”3 USCIS administers the DACA program, including collection of\n22 forms, documents, and fees; issuance of DACA approval and employment\n23 authorization notices; and issuance of termination notices. USCIS was the agency\n24 that “automatically” terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD without\n25 notice or an opportunity to be heard.\n26 7. ICE is a law enforcement agency within DHS that “enforces federal\n27 laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote\n28\n2 https://www.dhs.gov/our-mission (last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n3 https://www.uscis.gov/aboutus (last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n4\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.6   Page 6 of 29\n1 homeland security and public safety.” U.S. Immigration and Customs\n2 Enforcement, “Who We Are.”4\n3 8. CBP is a law enforcement agency within DHS that “is charged with\n4 keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful\n5 international travel and trade.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “About\n6 CBP.”5 CBP issued Mr. Gonzalez’s NTA charging unlawful presence in the\n7 United States.\n8 9. Defendants Does 1-10 are currently unidentified individuals whose\n9 actions, in addition to those of named Defendants, gave rise to Mr. Gonzalez’s\n10 claims.\n11 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n12 Establishment and Terms of the DACA Program\n13 10. On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet\n14 Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program. See June 15,\n15 2012 Memorandum from Janet Napolitano to ICE, CBP, and USCIS, “Exercising\n16 Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United\n17 States as Children” (“DACA Memo”).6 The DACA Memo explained that the\n18 “Nation’s immigration laws . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without\n19 consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case” and that\n20 “additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are\n21 not expended on . . . low priority cases.”\n22 11. Accordingly, the Government enacted a program of deferred action\n23 for individuals who were brought to the United States as children and meet specific\n24 criteria. Deferred action is a well-established form of administrative action by\n25 which the Executive Branch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain\n26\n27 4 https://www.ice.gov/about (last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n5 https://www.cbp.gov/about (last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n28\n6 https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-\nindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf.\n5\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.7   Page 7 of 29\n1 from seeking an individual’s removal from the country and authorizes his\n2 continued lawful presence for a specified period.\n3 12. A recipient of deferred action is eligible to receive employment\n4 authorization. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c). The DACA Memo directed USCIS to\n5 “accept applications to determine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work\n6 authorization during [their] period of deferred action.”\n7 13. President Obama explained that the Government instituted DACA\n8 because “it makes no sense to expel talented young people, who, for all intents and\n9 purposes, are Americans – they’ve been raised as Americans; understand\n10 themselves to be part of this country . . . [and] want to staff our labs, or start new\n11 businesses, or defend our country.” Accordingly, the President explained that\n12 DHS would be “taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young\n13 people” and giving them “a degree of relief and hope.” The White House, Office\n14 of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by the President on Immigration” (“Obama\n15 Remarks”) (June 15, 2012).7\n16 14. The DACA Memo established that the following criteria “should be\n17 satisfied” for DACA eligibility:\n18  came to the United States under the age of 16;\n19  continuously resided in the United States for at least 5 years preceding the date\n20 of the memorandum and was present in the United States on the date of the\n21 memorandum;\n22  is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general\n23 education development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the\n24 Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;\n25  has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense,\n26 or multiple misdemeanor offenses, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national\n27 security or public safety; and\n28\n7 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-\npresident-immigration.\n6\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.8   Page 8 of 29\n1  is not above the age of 30.\n2 15. The DACA Memo also directed that “[n]o individual should receive\n3 deferred action . . . unless they first pass a background check.”\n4 16. USCIS was tasked with implementing the DACA program, including\n5 collection of forms, documents, and fees and issuance of DACA approval and\n6 employment authorization notices. It promulgated a public policy document\n7 detailing how the DACA program operates. See USCIS, “DACA Frequently\n8 Asked Questions” (“DACA FAQ”).8\n9 17. Deferred action is available for 2 years, subject to renewal upon\n10 reapplication. A DACA recipient must reapply, pass another round of background\n11 checks, and pay another $495. Renewal requires that the recipient “met the\n12 guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA” and:\n13  did not depart the United States on or after August 15, 2012 without advance\n14 parole;\n15  has continuously resided in the United States since submitting his most recent\n16 request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; and\n17  has not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or 3 or more\n18 misdemeanors, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public\n19 safety.\n20 18. A DACA recipient “may obtain employment authorization from\n21 USCIS provided [he or she] can demonstrate an economic necessity for\n22 employment.” DACA FAQ, Q4. Upon approval, the recipient is issued an\n23 Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”).\n24 19. Even an individual who (1) is in removal proceedings, (2) has a final\n25 order of removal, or (3) has a voluntary departure order is eligible to apply for and\n26 be granted DACA status. See DACA FAQ, Q10.\n27\n8 https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-\n28\narrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions (updated Sept. 6, 2017; last visited\nSept. 7, 2017).\n7\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.9   Page 9 of 29\n1 Reaffirmation, Continuation, and Elimination of the DACA Program\n2 20. From January to September 5, 2017, the Trump Administration\n3 continued to process and grant new DACA applications, renewal applications, and\n4 EADs.\n5 21. On September 5, DHS announced a plan to phase out the DACA\n6 program over a two year period. See Sept. 5, 2017 Memorandum from Elaine C.\n7 Duke to ICE, CBP, and USCIS, “Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action\n8 for Child Arrivals” (“Duke Memo”).9\n9 22. The rescission reversed the current Administration’s several public\n10 assurances that DACA remained its policy.\n11 23. On February 20, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security (and\n12 current White House Chief of Staff) John Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth\n13 DHS’s immigration enforcement priorities. See Feb. 20, 2017 Memorandum from\n14 John Kelly to ICE, CBP, and USCIS, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to\n15 Serve the National Interest” (“Kelly Memo”).10 The Kelly Memo “immediately\n16 rescinded” “all existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance\n17 regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and priorities for removal,” but\n18 specifically exempted the June 15, 2012 DACA Memo.\n19 24. On June 15, 2017, DHS issued public guidance, explaining that\n20 “DACA recipients will continue to be eligible as outlined in the June 15, 2012\n21 memorandum”; EAD recipients “will be eligible to seek a two-year extension upon\n22 their expiration”; and “[n]o work permits will be terminated prior to their current\n23 expiration dates.” DHS, “Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of\n24 Memorandum Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful\n25 Permanent Residents (‘DAPA’)” (June 15, 2017).11\n26\n9 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca.\n27 10 https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-\nof-the-Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf.\n28\n11 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/06/15/frequently-asked-questions-rescission-\nmemorandum-providing-deferred-action-parents.\n8\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.10   Page 10 of 29\n1 25. On April 21, 2017, President Trump—using the common term for\n2 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children—assured that\n3 the Administration is “not after the dreamers.” He was asked, “that’s going to be\n4 the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?” The President\n5 responded unequivocally: “Yes. Yes. That’s our policy.” He elaborated: “The\n6 dreamers should rest easy. OK? I’ll give you that. The dreamers should rest\n7 easy.” Associated Press, “Transcript of AP Interview with Trump” (“Trump\n8 Interview”) (published Apr. 23, 2017).12\n9 DACA Application and Renewal Process\n10 26. A DACA applicant must submit to USCIS: (1) Form I-821D,\n11 Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; (2) Form I-765,\n12 Application for Employment Authorization; (3) Form I-765WS, Worksheet\n13 establishing economic need for employment; and (4) extensive documentation to\n14 establish that he or she meets the DACA Memo’s eligibility criteria and USCIS’s\n15 implementing criteria. See DACA FAQ, Q7, Q28-Q41.\n16 27. A DACA applicant “must undergo biographic and biometric\n17 background checks before USCIS will consider [his or her] request.” DACA FAQ,\n18 Q22. This involves checking biographic and biometric information “against a\n19 variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government agencies.”\n20 DACA FAQ, Q23.\n21 28. To be considered, an applicant must also pay a $495 fee, which\n22 “cannot be waived.” USCIS, “I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for\n23 Childhood Arrivals.”13\n24 29. A DACA renewal applicant must submit the same forms, undergo\n25 another round of biographic and biometric background checks, and pay another\n26 $495 fee.

If the background checks or other information indicate that the\n2 applicant’s presence “threatens public safety or national security,” deferred action\n3 will be denied absent “exceptional circumstances.” Indicators of such a threat\n4 include gang membership, participation in certain criminal activities, or\n5 participation in activities that threaten the United States. DACA FAQ, Q65.\n6 31. In 2015, USCIS further screened all individuals who had been granted\n7 DACA status “to identify records that contained information indicating known or\n8 suspected gang association.” Apr. 17, 2015 Letter from USCIS Director Leon\n9 Rodriguez to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley.15\n10 32. Even an individual (1) in removal proceedings, (2) with a final order\n11 of removal, or (3) with a voluntary departure order may apply for and be granted\n12 DACA status. See DACA FAQ, Q7. In support, such an individual can provide\n13 USCIS with “initial evidence” and “supporting documents” to plead eligibility and\n14 controvert Government allegations against that person.\n15 The Government’s DACA Termination Guidelines and Policies\n16 33. The DACA SOP governs USCIS’s implementation of the DACA\n17 program. It incorporates the 2011 USCIS Memo and the relevant procedures set\n18 forth therein.\n19 34. Under the DACA SOP, “[i]f disqualifying criminal offenses or public\n20 safety concerns . . . arise after” DACA status is granted, USCIS must issue the\n21 recipient a “Notice of Intent to Terminate” (“NOIT”) and “allow [him or her] 33\n22 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited” therein. DHS,\n23 “National Standard Operating Procedures, Deferred Action for Childhood\n24 Arrivals” (“DACA SOP”), Chapter 14 (Aug. 28, 2013).\n25\n26\n27 14 https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-821dinstr.pdf?download=1\n(updated Jan. 9, 2017; expires Jan. 31, 2019; last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n28\n15 https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-04-\n17%20USCIS%20to%20CEG%20(DACA%20for%20Gang%20Member).pdf.\n10\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.12   Page 12 of 29\n1 35. The exception to this rule is when USCIS follows a specific protocol\n2 for cases involving Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) concerns. If USCIS suspects\n3 that a particular DACA recipient poses an EPS concern, it must send the case to\n4 the Background Check Unit (“BCU”) DACA Team for consideration. If BCU\n5 suspects an EPS concern, it must refer the case to ICE to make a determination.\n6 DACA SOP, Chapter 14; Nov. 7, 2011 USCIS Policy Memorandum (“USCIS\n7 Memo”) at 3.16\n8 36. “All EPS cases must be referred to ICE” for “an opportunity to decide\n9 if, when, and how to issue an NTA . . . . USCIS will not issue an NTA in these\n10 cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA. . . . This referral process is utilized in order\n11 to give ICE the opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action before\n12 USCIS adjudicates the case.” USCIS Memo at 4. If, and only if, ICE issues an\n13 NTA on the basis of an EPS concern, USCIS may then terminate an individual’s\n14 DACA status without providing prior notice or an opportunity to be heard. ICE’s\n15 issuance of an NTA after an EPS referral is meant to allow USCIS to “proceed\n16 with adjudication, . . . taking into account the basis for the NTA.” USCIS Memo at\n17 4.\n18 37. Neither the DACA SOP nor the USCIS Memo authorizes termination\n19 without notice when CBP issues an NTA. In that instance, an NOIT and 33 days\n20 to respond are required. DACA SOP, Chapter 14 and Appendix I.\n21 38. An EPS referral does not require being charged or convicted of any\n22 crime. It requires only “information indicat[ing] the alien is under investigation\n23 for, has been arrested for (without disposition), or has been convicted of” one of a\n24 list of crimes, defined in Section 101 of the INA. USCIS Memo at 3.\n25\n26\n27\n16\n28\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_M\nemoranda/NTA%20PM%20%28Approved%20as%20final%2011-7-11%29.pdf.\n11\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.13   Page 13 of 29\n1 39. The USCIS Memo suggests that the determination to “investigate” or\n2 “arrest without disposition” a DACA recipient for one of the specific crimes may\n3 have been made by any single local, state, or federal law enforcement agent.\n4 40. USCIS affords a DACA recipient no opportunity to contest the\n5 grounds for an EPS referral.\n6 The Government’s Representations to DACA Applicants and Recipients\n7 41. DACA status confers numerous benefits on a recipient as part of the\n8 Government’s recognition that the United States “continue[s] to benefit . . . from\n9 the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing\n10 more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Dec. 30, 2016\n11 Letter from then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles Johnson to\n12 Representative Judy Chu (“Johnson Letter”) at 2.17\n13 42. In 2016, over 100 members of Congress sought confirmation that\n14 DACA applicants’ personal identifying information would be safeguarded. The\n15 Government affirmed that its “representations” that such information would not be\n16 used for “other immigration-related purposes . . . must continue to be honored.”\n17 The Government understands that “DACA applicants most assuredly relied” on its\n18 representations. Dec. 30, 2016 Johnson Letter at 1-2.\n19 43. More broadly, the DACA SOP codified the Government’s\n20 commitment to the DACA program, effectively limiting the exercise of agency\n21 discretion with “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions” for granting, denying,\n22 and terminating deferred action. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 173 (5th Cir. 2015)\n23 (citing the DACA SOP as evidence that DACA is not a truly discretionary\n24 program), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016).\n25 44. Executive and Legislative Branch officials from both political parties\n26 have reinforced the promises of the DACA program. They have publicly\n27\n17\n28\nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Respon\nse%20to%20Chu%2012.30.16.pdf.\n12\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.14   Page 14 of 29\n1 acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of DACA applicants and recipients have\n2 relied on the Government (1) to honor the benefits conferred by DACA and (2)\n3 implement and enforce it without policies or actions that are arbitrary, capricious,\n4 an abuse of discretion, contrary to internal guidelines, or unconstitutional.\n5  In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that the Government\n6 must ensure “that the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” DACA recipients and\n7 their families, because they have “organize[d] [their] li[ves] around” the DACA\n8 program. CNN, “Transcripts: Town Hall Meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan”\n9 (Jan. 12, 2017).18\n10  In February 2017, Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva called on the\n11 Government to “honor its word to protect” those who came forward “expecting”\n12 the Government to uphold its “commitment.” Congressional Progressive Caucus,\n13 “Congressional Progressive Caucus Leaders Respond to ICE Arrest of DACA\n14 Recipient” (Feb. 16, 2017).19\n15  In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary Kelly reaffirmed that DACA status “is a\n16 commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person.” Ted Hesson and\n17 Seung Min Kim, “Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration,”\n18 Politico (Mar. 29, 2017).20\n19  And in April 2017, President Trump reiterated that “[D]reamers should rest\n20 easy.” Apr. 21, 2017 Trump Interview.\n21 45. However, on September 5, 2017, DHS announced President Trump’s\n22 plan to phase out the DACA program over the next two years. Current DACA\n23 recipients whose status expires before March 5, 2018 have until October 5, 2017 to\n24 apply to USCIS for a two-year renewal.\n25\n26\n18 https://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1701/12/se.01.html.\n27 19 https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/press-releases/congressional-progressive-caucus-\nleaders-respond-to-ice-arrest-of-daca-recipient/.\n28\n20 https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/wary-dems-look-to-kelly-for-answers-\non-immigration-236673.\n13\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.15   Page 15 of 29\n1 Benefits Conferred by the Government on DACA Recipients\n2 46. DACA status confers numerous benefits on a recipient. Chief among\n3 them is USCIS’s explanation that a DACA recipient “is authorized by DHS to be\n4 present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully\n5 present during the period deferred action is in effect.” DACA FAQ, Q1; see\n6 Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1058-59 (9th Cir. 2014)\n7 (“DHS considers DACA recipients not to be unlawfully present in the United\n8 States because their deferred action is a period of stay authorized by the Attorney\n9 General.”) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3)); Texas\n10 v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148 (“[L]awful presence” has “significant legal\n11 consequences.”).\n12 47. Because DACA recipients are lawfully present, the Government has\n13 directed ICE and CBP “to prevent qualifying individuals from being apprehended,\n14 placed into removal proceedings, or removed.” DACA FAQ, Q9.\n15 48. DACA recipients are also eligible for a DACA-specific EAD “for the\n16 period of deferred action,” for which they would otherwise be ineligible. DACA\n17 FAQ, Q1; see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12, Category (c)(33).21\n18 49. DACA recipients may apply for certain federal public benefits for\n19 which they would otherwise be ineligible, including Social Security retirement\n20 benefits, Social Security disability benefits, and Medicare Part A health insurance\n21 benefits. See 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(2)-(3). They may also be eligible for state public\n22 benefits, including a driver’s license or unemployment insurance. See 8 U.S.C. §\n23 1621(d). Accord Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n24 50. DACA recipients, by virtue of obtaining Social Security Numbers, are\n25 also afforded ancillary benefits that are typically unavailable or difficult to obtain\n26 for undocumented immigrants, including opening a bank account, obtaining a\n27\n21 https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/information-employers-\n28\nemployees/employer-information/employment-authorization (updated Jan. 27,\n2015; last visited Sept. 7, 2017).\n14\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.16   Page 16 of 29\n1 credit card, starting a business, purchasing a home or car, and obtaining financial\n2 aid for higher education.\n3 51. DACA recipients do not accrue time for unlawful presence for\n4 admissibility purposes under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). See DACA FAQ, Q5.\n5 And—prior to the September 5 change in policy—for certain humanitarian,\n6 educational, and employment purposes, recipients could briefly leave the country\n7 and legally return, a benefit the Government does not afford to those it does not\n8 deem lawfully present. See DACA FAQ, Q57.\n9 52. In short, “lawful presence removes the categorical bar” to certain\n10 public benefits and participation in several crucial elements of social, civic, and\n11 economic life in the United States. Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d at 148.\n12 53. In other words, the Government has taken steps to “lift the shadow of\n13 deportation from these young people” and given them “a degree of relief and\n14 hope.” June 15, 2012 Obama Remarks. As a result of DACA, hundreds of\n15 thousands of Dreamers “have been able to enroll in colleges and universities,\n16 complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and give\n17 back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and\n18 entrepreneurs—all on the books.” Dec. 30, 2016 Johnson Letter at 2.\n19 Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA Status and Employment Authorization\n20 54. Mr. Gonzalez graduated on time from Altus Charter High School in\n21 San Diego in 2011. Despite the support of his family and friends, he was unable to\n22 secure lawful employment from 2011 to 2013 because he was unwilling to\n23 misrepresent his immigration status to prospective employers.\n24 55. In 2013, Mr. Gonzalez learned of the DACA program. He expended\n25 significant time and resources filling out the USCIS forms; gathering the necessary\n26 supporting evidence and documentation; attending a biometrics appointment where\n27 his photograph and fingerprints were taken; and paying the $495 filing fee.\n28\n15\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.17   Page 17 of 29\n1 56. Mr. Gonzalez provided the Government his birth certificate; school\n2 records from childhood to graduation, including report cards and certificates of\n3 achievement; several years of his family’s tax returns; and his prior addresses, all\n4 of which are in San Diego.\n5 57. Ultimately, the Government granted Mr. Gonzalez DACA status and\n6 employment authorization on January 22, 2013, valid until January 21, 2015.\n7 58. In 2014, Mr. Gonzalez timely applied for renewal of his DACA status\n8 and EAD, again complying with the paperwork and biographic and biometric\n9 background checks, and paying a second fee. Upon review of these materials, the\n10 Government granted Mr. Gonzalez’s renewal application, deeming him lawfully\n11 present and authorized to work in the United States until December 22, 2017.\n12 59. In 2015, USCIS further screened all individuals who had been granted\n13 DACA status “to identify records that contained information indicating known or\n14 suspected gang association.” Apr. 17, 2015 Letter from USCIS Director Leon\n15 Rodriguez to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley.22\n16 60. The Government therefore confirmed, on at least 3 separate occasions,\n17 that Mr. Gonzalez is deserving of DACA benefits and does not pose a threat to\n18 national security or public safety.\n19 61. In an apparent oversight, on June 25, 2017—over a year after\n20 automatically terminating his DACA status and EAD—USCIS sent Mr. Gonzalez\n21 a notice to timely submit his DACA and EAD renewal applications ahead of their\n22 December expiration.\n23 Mr. Gonzalez’s Employment\n24 62. With EAD in hand, Mr. Gonzalez sought and quickly obtained\n25 employment in 2013. He was hired to perform food and equipment setup and\n26 stocking for Gate Gourmet, a provider of airline catering and provision services.\n27 Because he was preparing trays that were carried on commercial aircraft, Mr.\n28\n22 https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-04-\n17%20USCIS%20to%20CEG%20(DACA%20for%20Gang%20Member).pdf.\n16\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.18   Page 18 of 29\n1 Gonzalez’s employer required that he pass additional security tests, including\n2 interviews, drug tests, security clearance protocols, and EAD verification. He\n3 passed all of them.\n4 63. Mr. Gonzalez was a dutiful and trusted employee for nearly 3 years.\n5 He was primarily responsible for provisioning 7 flights, 5 nights a week for\n6 American Airlines, but was often tasked with helping others who were responsible\n7 for Canada Air, Delta, Hawaiian, United, and US Airways. From the time he was\n8 hired to the time of his inexplicable arrest and detention, Mr. Gonzalez worked 5\n9 nights a week from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. Upon coming home to\n10 his shared apartment, he often slept most of the day before returning to work in the\n11 evening.\n12 64. The money Mr. Gonzalez made at Gate Gourmet went toward\n13 supporting his family. He was also saving up to buy his own car, but after he was\n14 detained, his family was forced to divert those savings to securing his release.\n15 65. When Mr. Gonzalez was released from his month-long detention, he\n16 voluntarily informed Gate Gourmet that his EAD had been terminated. He had to\n17 be let go, but his employer asked him to reapply when his EAD or other\n18 employment authorization is restored.\n19 Mr. Gonzalez’s Arrest, Detention, and Release\n20 66. On May 6, 2016, an acquaintance known to Mr. Gonzalez only as\n21 “Adolfo” asked him to come to his home and care for his dogs for the afternoon\n22 while Adolfo was out of town. Mr. Gonzalez agreed, having previously done so\n23 without issue. His sister dropped him off at Adolfo’s home sometime between\n24 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.\n25 67. Mr. Gonzalez entered the unlocked home and was surprised to\n26 discover that 2 people were already there. One was a man whom Mr. Gonzalez\n27 recognized as “Romeo,” and the other was a woman he did not know.\n28\n17\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.19   Page 19 of 29\n1 68. Having fed and cleaned up after the dogs, and realizing that others\n2 were there to look after them, Mr. Gonzalez considered leaving. But he was\n3 without transportation.\n4 69. For the rest of the afternoon, Mr. Gonzalez kept to himself, passing\n5 the time watching movies and television while he waited for his sister to pick him\n6 up and take him to his regular early-evening-to-early-morning work shift. At\n7 approximately 4:00 p.m., a law enforcement officer knocked on the front door and\n8 asked to enter the house. Mr. Gonzalez felt it was inappropriate to allow them into\n9 someone else’s home unless they had a search warrant. He said so to the officers,\n10 who stopped trying to enter the house and stopped speaking to him. But Mr.\n11 Gonzalez noticed that the officers continued to surround the house.\n12 70. About an hour later, a man Mr. Gonzalez did not recognize arrived at\n13 the house with the law enforcement officers. He identified himself as the owner\n14 and asked Mr. Gonzalez to exit.\n15 71. By that time, Mr. Gonzalez knew he would soon have to leave for\n16 work. His manager had an unforgiving policy toward tardiness, and Mr. Gonzalez\n17 believed he would have little difficulty resolving the situation with law\n18 enforcement and being allowed to go to work.\n19 72. Mr. Gonzalez (and Romeo) exited the house. Relying on the\n20 Government’s assurances—publicly and in his DACA approval notices—that\n21 DACA status barred his apprehension as long as he had not committed any crimes,\n22 which he had not, Mr. Gonzalez informed the officers of his DACA status and of\n23 his need to get to work.\n24 73. Mr. Gonzalez had his DACA EAD with C-33 classification with him.\n25 He handed it to one of the officers for verification.\n26 74. After that officer walked away, a second officer told Mr. Gonzalez\n27 that he would be detained. Mr. Gonzalez asked why, to which the officer replied\n28\n18\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.20   Page 20 of 29\n1 that he was in the country illegally and his DACA status did not matter. A third\n2 officer abruptly grabbed Mr. Gonzalez by the arm and handcuffed him.\n3 75. Romeo was taken away in handcuffs, and the officer who threatened\n4 Mr. Gonzalez with detention and the officer who handcuffed him went inside the\n5 house.\n6 76. Mr. Gonzalez sat on the front porch—handcuffed—unable to see\n7 inside the house. He heard no sounds coming from inside the house. He did not\n8 see or hear anyone else go in or out of the house. Within a couple of minutes—\n9 without further questioning or explanation—the officer who was checking Mr.\n10 Gonzalez’s immigration status put him in a police car and took him away. Mr.\n11 Gonzalez did not see that officer speak to or engage with anyone who went inside\n12 the house.\n13 77. Mr. Gonzalez was taken to a detention facility, where he was\n14 questioned by a handful of officers, one at a time. They did not ask any specific or\n15 pointed questions. Mr. Gonzalez repeatedly answered to the effect of, “I don’t\n16 understand why I’m being detained.”\n17 78. During the questioning, officers threatened to detain his family\n18 members.\n19 79. Seeing and fearing the officers’ hostility and willingness to threaten\n20 him and his family for reasons he did not understand, Mr. Gonzalez handed over\n21 his phone.\n22 80. The officers looked through the contacts and communications, asking\n23 who certain names were. Mr. Gonzalez gave them the boring answers: “my soccer\n24 buddy,” “my ex-girlfriend,” “my brother,” and so on. Mr. Gonzalez saw the\n25 disappointment in the officers’ faces as they scoured the phone’s contents.\n26 81. For 2 or 3 days, Mr. Gonzalez was denied food, deliberately woken up\n27 with loud bangs by officers (who laughed at his shocked fear), and threatened with\n28 detention of his family. After that, the officers apparently lost interest in Mr.\n19\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.21   Page 21 of 29\n1 Gonzalez. He was transferred to a second facility. For approximately a week he\n2 was ignored. No one came to question him, and his requests for an explanation or\n3 right to call his family simply went unanswered. Subsequently, Mr. Gonzalez was\n4 transferred to a third facility, where he was finally permitted to contact his family\n5 after approximately 10 days in detention.\n6 82. For the final three or more weeks of Mr. Gonzalez’s detention, law\n7 enforcement officers continued to ignore him. The questioning ceased entirely.\n8 After the initial 2 days of threats, abuse, and unsubstantiated accusations, officers\n9 apparently determined that Mr. Gonzalez had no part in the events at Adolfo’s\n10 house that concerned them and was not a person of interest.\n11 83. On June 1, 2016—nearly a month after his unwarranted and unlawful\n12 arrest and detention—Immigration Judge McSeveney ordered Mr. Gonzalez\n13 released from custody on a mere $5,000 bond. The Judge stated that Mr. Gonzalez\n14 was not a danger to the public. DHS waived appeal, and Mr. Gonzalez was finally\n15 released on June 3, 2016.\n16 USCIS’s Automatic Termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA Status and EAD\n17 84. On May 7, 2016—the day after Mr. Gonzalez’s arrest—CBP issued\n18 him an NTA. Its sole charge is that Mr. Gonzalez is unlawfully present in the\n19 United States under Section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The\n20 NTA made no other allegations of wrongdoing or unlawful behavior, let alone\n21 criminality.\n22 85. On May 23, 2016, USCIS sent Mr. Gonzalez a Notice of Action,\n23 explaining that:\n24  “On May 7, 2016, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued you a Notice\n25 to Appear (NTA).”\n26  “USCIS is notifying you that your deferred action as a childhood arrival and\n27 your employment authorization terminated automatically as of the date your NTA\n28 [for unlawful presence] was issued.”\n20\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.22   Page 22 of 29\n1  “An appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed\n2 on behalf of the requestor.”\n3 CAUSES OF ACTION\n4 COUNT ONE\n5 Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious Action\n6 86. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n7 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n8 87. This Count seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the APA.\n9 88. The APA provides that courts “shall hold unlawful and set aside\n10 agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse\n11 of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n12 89. The termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and work\n13 authorization constitutes final agency action that cannot be appealed, as stated in\n14 USCIS’s May 23, 2016 Notice of Action.\n15 90. Agencies must provide “reasoned explanation[s]” for their actions,\n16 and courts must reverse agency actions for which they cannot discern a reason.\n17 The Government has provided no explanation—let alone a reasoned one—for its\n18 automatic termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and EAD in violation of\n19 multiple provisions of the DACA SOP and USCIS Memo, which establish the\n20 binding process for DACA termination.\n21 91. The DACA SOP and USCIS Memo typically require USCIS to issue a\n22 DACA beneficiary an NOIT and 33 days to respond before determining whether to\n23 terminate DACA status. But USCIS did not provide Mr. Gonzalez with notice or\n24 an opportunity to respond before terminating his DACA status. Termination may\n25 proceed without notice when USCIS follows the protocol for EPS cases, see supra\n26 ¶¶ 34-39, including referral of the case to BCU and ultimately to ICE and the\n27 issuance of an NTA by ICE based on alleged EPS concerns. But USCIS did not\n28 follow the protocol for EPS cases, nor did ICE issue Mr. Gonzalez an NTA based\n21\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.23   Page 23 of 29\n1 on a finding that his was an EPS case. Neither the DACA SOP nor the USCIS\n2 Memo provides for “automatic” termination without notice when CBP issues an\n3 NTA based on unlawful presence. But USCIS terminated Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n4 status automatically upon CBP’s issuance of an NTA that listed unlawful presence\n5 as its sole basis. Moreover, USCIS’s own guidelines make clear that, even upon\n6 ICE’s issuance of an NTA in an EPS case, USCIS should proceed by “taking into\n7 account the basis for the NTA.” USCIS Memo at 4. By adopting an unwritten\n8 “policy” of automatic termination regardless of the basis for an NTA and\n9 regardless of the issuing agency, USCIS expressly eschewed any consideration of\n10 the basis for the NTA.\n11 92. In at least these ways, USCIS’s termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA\n12 status violated established procedure for DACA termination and, for that reason,\n13 was arbitrary and capricious.\n14 93. USCIS’s termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status was also\n15 arbitrary and capricious because USCIS failed to exercise its discretion through\n16 reasoned decision-making and merely terminated his status “automatically” based\n17 on a CBP officer’s decision to issue an NTA for unlawful presence, which is not\n18 even a relevant factor in the determination of DACA eligibility.\n19 94. The termination decision is also arbitrary and capricious because: (a)\n20 USCIS failed to articulate any reason for terminating DACA benefits; (b) DACA\n21 status is expressly available to those who are subject to NTAs and thus cannot\n22 terminate automatically upon the issuance of an NTA; (c) it purports to rest on a\n23 practice that finds no support in procedures that govern DACA termination and\n24 constitutes an abrupt departure from established termination practice; (d) it would\n25 make termination hinge on an immigration official’s decision to issue an NTA\n26 without any allegation of wrongdoing; and (e) “automatic” termination does not\n27 involve the exercise of discretion, which is required before USCIS may terminate\n28 DACA status.\n22\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.24   Page 24 of 29\n1 95. For all of these reasons, USCIS’s decision to terminate Mr.\n2 Gonzalez’s DACA status and work authorization violated the APA and must be set\n3 aside as arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\n4 COUNT TWO\n5 Administrative Procedure Act – Unconstitutional Action\n6 96. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n7 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n8 97. This Count seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the APA.\n9 98. The APA provides that courts “shall hold unlawful and set aside\n10 agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be contrary to constitutional\n11 right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). Defendants violated the APA because their\n12 termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and work authorization violated his\n13 rights under the Due Process Clause.\n14 99. The termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and work\n15 authorization constitutes final agency action that cannot be appealed, as stated in\n16 USCIS’s May 23, 2016 Notice of Action.\n17 100. Aliens who are physically present in the United States are guaranteed\n18 the protections of the Due Process Clause. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678,\n19 693 (2001); U.S. v. Peralta-Sanchez, 847 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[T]he\n20 Due Process Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United States, including\n21 aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”).\n22 101. When a person has a protected liberty or property interest, the\n23 Constitution constrains government action that deprives the person of that interest\n24 without due process. See Nozzi v. Housing Authority of LA, 806 F.3d 1178, 1190-\n25 91 (9th Cir. 2015); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).\n26 102. DACA status confers a liberty interest to be free from apprehension,\n27 arrest, or detention on the basis of immigration status. The term liberty also\n28 encompasses the ability to work, raise a family, and “form the other enduring\n23\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.25   Page 25 of 29\n1 attachments of normal life.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972).\n2 Where, as here, an individual reasonably relies on a conferred status to pursue\n3 these activities, that status cannot be revoked without due process. See Bell v.\n4 Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971).\n5 103. DACA status also confers property interests, which “extend beyond\n6 tangible property and include anything to which a plaintiff has a legitimate claim\n7 of entitlement . . . [as] created [by] . . . rules or understandings that secure certain\n8 benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” Nozzi, 806 F.3d\n9 at 1191.\n10 104. Mr. Gonzalez possessed a property interest in his DACA status and\n11 the numerous benefits conferred by it, including employment authorization,\n12 eligibility for federal and state public benefits, and the ability to leave the country\n13 and return legally under certain circumstances.\n14 105. While the Government may argue that DACA status confers no\n15 substantive rights or benefits, “the identification of property interests under\n16 constitutional law turns on the substance of the interest recognized, not the name\n17 given that interest by the state.” Newman v. Sathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d 786, 797\n18 (9th Cir. 2002). The “mutually explicit understandings” created by the\n19 Government’s establishment and continuous operation of the DACA program—\n20 under a well-defined framework and highly specific criteria—created a reasonable\n21 expectation of entitlement to DACA status and its attendant benefits, which cannot\n22 be terminated without due process. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601\n23 (1972).\n24 106. Even if the Government’s ultimate decision about whether to\n25 terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status is discretionary, its policy and process\n26 must be rational and conform to constitutional procedural due process\n27 requirements. See Galvin v. Hay, 374 F.3d 739, 758 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[F]ederal\n28 officials do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights.”)\n24\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.26   Page 26 of 29\n1 107. The Government’s conduct in depriving Mr. Gonzalez of his protected\n2 liberty and property interests is evaluated under the three-part Eldridge test, under\n3 which courts must balance (1) the nature of the interest and the degree of potential\n4 deprivation, (2) the fairness and reliability of existing procedures and the value of\n5 additional procedural safeguards, and (3) the public interest.\n6 108. Here, the automatic termination of Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status,\n7 EAD, and other benefits without any notice or opportunity to be heard fails the\n8 Eldridge test. First, his protected interests are extremely significant. Second, the\n9 existing procedure is a wholly inadequate abrogation of the “essence of due\n10 process”—notice and a meaningful opportunity to present one’s case. Eldridge,\n11 424 U.S. at 348-49. And third, there is no credible burden associated with\n12 adequate procedural safeguards, or public benefit from their absence.\n13 109. For all of these reasons, Defendants’ automatic termination of Mr.\n14 Gonzalez’s DACA status and work authorization violated his rights under the Due\n15 Process Clause and must therefore be set aside as a violation of the APA.\n16 COUNT THREE\n17 Declaratory Relief\n18 110. Mr. Gonzalez repeats and incorporates by reference each and every\n19 preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.\n20 111. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that Defendants’ automatic\n21 termination of his DACA status and EAD was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n22 discretion, and failed to adhere to the DACA SOP and USCIS Memo.\n23 112. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that (1) he has constitutionally\n24 protected liberty and property interests in his DACA status and its attendant\n25 benefits, and therefore (2) Defendants’ termination of those interests without notice\n26 of a reasoned basis for its decision and a meaningful opportunity to respond was\n27 unlawful and invalid.\n28\n25\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.27   Page 27 of 29\n1 113. Mr. Gonzalez seeks a declaration that, for all these reasons,\n2 Defendants’ automatic termination of his DACA status and EAD violated the APA\n3 and must be set aside.\n4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n5 WHEREFORE, Mr. Gonzalez prays that this Court grant the following\n6 relief:\n7 (1) Declare that Defendants’ termination of DACA status and its attendant\n8 benefits—without notice, opportunity to contest, or opportunity to appeal—upon\n9 CBP’s issuance of a Notice to Appear charging nothing more than unlawful\n10 presence in the United States (i) is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion;\n11 (ii) violates Mr. Gonzalez’s rights under the Due Process Clause; and (iii) as a\n12 result, violates the APA and must be set aside;\n13 (2) Declare (i) that Mr. Gonzalez has constitutionally protected liberty and\n14 property interests in his DACA status and its attendant benefits, and (ii) that\n15 Defendants’ termination of those interests was unlawful and invalid;\n16 (3) Set aside and enjoin Defendants’ decision to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s\n17 DACA status and EAD;\n18 (4) Order Defendants to restore Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status and attendant\n19 benefits, including employment authorization, pending a reconsideration of its\n20 termination decision, in which Defendants provide him notice of their intent to\n21 terminate, a reasoned basis for that intent, and an opportunity to respond with\n22 argument and evidence;\n23 (5) Award Mr. Gonzalez reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees; and\n24 (6) Grant any other and further relief that this Court deems fit and proper.\n25\n26\n27\n28\n26\nCOMPLAINTFORDECLARATORYANDINJUNCTIVERELIEF\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 1   Filed 09/11/17   PageID.28   Page 28 of 29\nDated: September 11, 2017 Respectfully submitted,\n1\n2 /s/ John C.

Plaintiff Cannot Overcome his Lack of Standing to Raise Claims Regarding \n11  \nthe Enjoined May 2016 Termination of his DACA.  \n22  \nIn his response to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff argues that there is an \n33  \nongoing harm from the initial termination of his DACA in May 2016 that confers \n44  \nstanding to ask the Court essentially to enjoin that termination a second time. See Dkt. \n55  \nNo. 50 at 10. However, Plaintiff cites to Anderson v. Evans, 371 F.3d 475, 479 (9th Cir. \n66  \n2004), for the proposition that a claim is not mooted where “precedential harms continue \n77  \nto flow from the government’s action.” Id. Anderson is inapposite for two reasons. First, \n88  \nAnderson does not address standing at all, certainly not in the specific context of a \n99  \nplaintiff who filed an amended complaint after receiving the relief requested in his \n1111  \noriginal complaint. Second, the “precedential harms” finding from Anderson on which \n1122  \nPlaintiff relies is specifically based on a regulation that requires “[t]he precedential \n1133  \neffects of past agency decisions must be considered when an agency determines whether \n1144  \nan environmental impact statement (EIS) is required.” Anderson, 371 F.3d at 479, citing \n1155  \n40 C.F.R. § 1508.27. That regulation is not applicable here.  \n1166  \nHere, Mr. Gonzales had his DACA reinstated, and was issued a Notice of Intent to \n1177  \nTerminate in which Defendants provided “a reasoned basis for that intent, and an \n1188  \nopportunity to respond with argument and evidence.” Compl., Prayer for Relief ¶ 4; Dkt. \n1199  \nNo. 49-1 at 13-14. Plaintiff’s disagreement with the outcome of the process he sought and \n2200  \nreceived does not establish standing to again challenge the now-reversed May 2016 \n2211  \ntermination of his DACA, which is no longer a final agency action or live controversy. \n2222  \nII.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Hear a Challenge to the Discretionary \n2233   Decision to Terminate DACA. \n2244   In finding jurisdiction to grant Plaintiff his first preliminary injunction, this Court \n2255   held that “[u]nder [8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)], the court is stripped of jurisdiction to entertain \n2266   Defendants’ ultimate discretionary determination as to Plaintiff’s DACA status.” Dkt. \n2277   No. 12 at 8. The Court found only that “this provision does not deprive the court of \n2288   jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiff’s claim that the termination of his DACA status did not \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n1 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1364   Page 3 of 12\n \n11   comply with the non-discretionary DACA SOP.” Id. Although Plaintiff incorrectly \n22   asserts that the first preliminary injunction is the law of the case, Dkt. No. 50 at 6, 11, \n33   there is a “general practice” that a Court “should ordinarily follow [the rules it previously \n44   decided on] during the pendency of the matter.” Id., citing Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136 \n55   F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1153-54 (E.D. Cal. 2001).1 Defendants agree that this Court should \n66   rely on its previous section 1252(g) findings to inform its decision here, albeit under the \n77   changed circumstances that existed at the time the amended complaint and new motion \n88   were filed.  \n99   The Court previously found jurisdiction on the basis that Defendants had not \n1111   complied with the procedural requirements of the DACA SOP. Any defect in that process \n1122   was cured with Defendants’ reinstatement of Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD; issuance of a \n1133   Notice of Intent to Terminate that included an opportunity to respond with arguments and \n1144   evidence; and issuance of a decision that invoked DHS’s discretion to terminate DACA \n1155   and specifically cited the section of the DACA SOP that permitted termination in this \ncircumstance. See Dkt. Nos. 49 at 11; 44 at 12-13. Plaintiff now seeks to overturn that \n1166  \ndiscretionary decision, an action this Court has already found it lacks jurisdiction to do.2 \n1177  \nDkt. No. 12 at 8. Plaintiff’s argument that nothing “relevant to the Court’s jurisdictional \n1188  \ndeterminations has changed since September 2017” is manifestly incorrect. Id. at 11.  \n1199  \nUnder the new facts of the amended complaint, the Court should find again that it \n2200  \nlacks jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the discretionary decision to terminate DACA.  \n2211  \n                                                 \n2222  \n1 Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants’ arguments should now be barred because there was no appeal of \n2233   the Court’s first preliminary injunction lacks merit. Here, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint based on \nhis new circumstances, such that the first injunction is no longer operative for appeal. See Rockwell Int'l \n2244   Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007) (“[C]ourts look to the amended complaint to determine \njurisdiction.”). \n2255  \n \n2266   2 Plaintiff’s reliance on United States v. Hovsepian, remains misplaced. Hovsepian reaffirmed that “the \ndistrict court may consider a purely legal question that does not challenge the Attorney General's \n2277   discretionary authority.” See 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004). Plaintiff here is directly “asking this \nCourt. . . how does the DACA program define ‘enforcement priorities’ for termination purposes?” Dkt. \n2288  \nNo. 50 at 13 (emphasis in original). Because the definition and application of enforcement priorities to \n   an individual is a discretionary authority vested in DHS, Hovsepian does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims. \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1365   Page 4 of 12\n \nIII.  Plaintiff continues to misstate the Ninth Circuit on section 1252(b)(9).  \n11  \nAs to Plaintiff’s assertions that the Court should follow its prior finding that \n22  \njurisdiction is not barred under section 1252(b)(9), Defendants continue to respectfully \n33  \nassert that finding was incorrect, and offer additional authority (both controlling and \n44  \npersuasive) to support their argument. See Mayweathers, 136 F. Supp. 2d at 1154 \n55  \n(“Grounds justifying departure from the law of the case include substantially different \n66  \nevidence, a change in controlling authority, or any error in the court's prior decision.”). \n77  \nPlaintiff argues once again that because section 1252(b)(9) “applies only to those claims \n88  \nseeking judicial review of orders of removal,” that he is not barred from raising a \n99  \nchallenge related to his removal proceedings because he is not subject to a final order of \n1111  \nremoval. Dkt. No. 50 at 15, citing J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 (9th Cir. \n1122  \n2016), Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007); INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. \n1133  \n289, 313 (2001). Plaintiff also misleadingly argues again that J.E.F.M. found that claims \n1144  \ncould not be barred from district court review if they could not have been litigated in \n1155  \nremoval proceedings. Dkt. No. 50 at 15, citing J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032.  \n1166  \nBoth claims are taken out of context, applied incorrectly here, and are thoroughly \n1177  \nunsupported by a proper reading of J.E.F.M. and the case law of the Supreme Court and \n1188  \nthe Ninth Circuit. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1031-32 (“The Supreme Court has thus \n1199  \ncharacterized § 1252(b)(9) as a  ‘zipper’ clause, [] explaining that the statute’s purpose ‘is \n2200  \nto consolidate judicial review of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of \n2211  \nappeals[.]”), quoting Reno v. Am.–Arab Anti–Discrimination Comm. (AAADC), 525 U.S. \n2222  \n471, 483 (1999) and INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 & n.37 (2001). \n2233  \nFurthermore, another court in this District recently found that sections 1252(a)(5) \n2244  \nand (b)(9) barred jurisdiction of constitutional and APA claims related to removal \n2255  \nactivity, regardless of whether a final order had issued or whether the claims could be \n2266  \nadjudicated by an immigration judge. See Castellar v. Nielsen, No. 17-CV-0491-BAS-\n2277  \nBGS, 2018 WL 786742, at *15 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2018) (specifically rejecting the finding \n2288  \nin Medina v. DHS, No. C17-218-RSM-JPD, 2017 WL 2954719, at *14 (W.D. Wash. \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1366   Page 5 of 12\n \n11   Mar. 14, 2017), that J.E.F.M. was in conflict with Singh or Nadarajah).3 Plaintiffs in \n22   Castellar raised Fourth and Fifth Amendment and APA claims regarding the delay \n33   between when they were first detained and when they were first brought before an \n44   immigration judge. Id. at *4-6. Plaintiffs raised the same three arguments plaintiff here \n55   raises: 1. “their claims are independent of the substantive merits of their removal \n66   proceedings;” 2. “because their claims do not require judicial review of a final order of \n77   removal, they may assert them now;” and 3. their claims “cannot be meaningfully heard \n88   in the administrative process.” Id. at *12, *14, *15. The Court rejected all three claims:  \n99   Neither the statute, nor its interpretation by the Ninth Circuit identifies an \nexception to the channeling function of Section 1252(b)(9) based on whether \n1111  \nthe asserted claims go to the “substantive merits” of a removal proceeding. [] \n1122   To the contrary, the Ninth Circuit has clarified, “Congress intended to channel \nall claims arising from the removal proceedings . . . to the federal courts of \n1133  \nappeals.” J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1033. So long as the claims arise from the \n1144  \nremoval proceeding or any action taken to remove an alien, they are swept up \n1155   by Section 1252(b)(9). \nId. at *14 (emphasis added in original).  \n1166  \nThe jurisdictional channeling function of Section 1252(b)(9) is not defeated \n1177  \nsimply because Plaintiffs are at a stage of the removal proceedings at which \n1188  \nno final order of removal has issued against them. Aliens cannot “bypass the \n1199   immigration courts and directly proceed to district court,” but rather “must \nexhaust the administrative process before they can access the federal courts” \n2200  \nwhen their claims arise from removal proceedings.  \n2211  \nId. at *15, quoting J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1029. \n2222  \nThe Ninth Circuit further explained that notwithstanding the inability of an \n2233   immigration  judge  or  the  BIA  to  order  court-appointed  counsel  and \nnotwithstanding a failure to raise such a claim in removal proceedings, the \n2244  \ncourt of appeals would have authority to consider such a constitutional claim. \n2255  \nId. at *15, quoting J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1038 (internal citation omitted). \n2266  \n \n2277  \n                                                 \n2288  \n3 Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding jurisdiction in district court to hear a \n   habeas challenge where plaintiff had been granted asylum but remained in detention for five years).  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1367   Page 6 of 12\n \nA. Section 1252(b)(9) still applies before a final order of removal issues. \n11  \nRecent Supreme Court authority supports the proposition that section 1252(b)(9) \n22  \nworks to bar district court jurisdiction over a claim “challenging the decision to . . . seek \n33  \nremoval,” although plaintiffs lacked final orders of removal. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 \n44  \nS. Ct. 830, 841 (2018). In his concurrence, Justice Thomas explained:  \n55  \nThe text of this provision is clear. Courts generally lack jurisdiction over “all \n66  \nquestions of law and fact,” both “constitutional” and “statutory,” that “aris[e] \n77   from” an “action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.” If an alien \nraises a claim arising from such an action or proceeding, courts cannot review \n88  \nit unless they are reviewing “a final order” under § 1252(a)(1) or exercising \n99  \njurisdiction “otherwise provided” in § 1252. \n1111   id. at 853-54 (Thomas, J. concurring) (emphasis added). Thus, section 1252(b)(9) does \n1122   not lie feckless until a final order of removal issues, but rather acts as a channeling \n1133   provision throughout the removal process to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal \n1144   nature of the review process.” Aguilar v. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9-10 \n1155   (1st Cir. 2007) (cited favorably throughout J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d 1026). In J.E.F.M., the \n1166   Ninth Circuit explicitly acknowledged that the plaintiffs “are at various stages of the \n1177   removal process: some are waiting to have their first removal hearing, some have already \n1188   had a hearing, and some have been ordered removed in absentia.” 837 F.3d at 1029. \n1199   There can be no dispute that a final order of removal is not a predicate for section \n2200   1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar over any claim arising out of removal proceedings. \n2211   B. Plaintiff is incorrect that section 1252(b)(9) does not bar constitutional \nclaims from district court review. \n2222  \nPlaintiff also cites this Court’s prior finding, also based on J.E.F.M., that, because \n2233  \n“an immigration judge has no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or to authorize an \n2244  \napplication for renewal of DACA status,” section 1252(b)(9) cannot bar a district court \n2255  \nfrom hearing a DACA challenge. Dkt. No. 50 at 15, citing Dkt. No. 12 at 11. Plaintiff is \n2266  \ncorrect that J.E.F.M. acknowledged that the claim in Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 \n2277  \n(9th Cir. 2007), could proceed in district court because “Singh would have had no legal \n2288  \navenue to obtain judicial review of [his] claim.” J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1368   Page 7 of 12\n \n11   (9th Cir. 2016). However, the J.E.F.M. Court also explained that the reason Singh could \n22   not obtain relief in removal proceedings was because his ineffective assistance of counsel \n33   claim arose after those proceedings had ended. Id., citing Singh, 499 F.3d at 974. Thus, it \n44   was literally impossible for him to have raised the claim in removal proceedings. The \n55   J.E.F.M. Court further explained in great detail that the inability of the immigration judge \n66   to relieve a constitutional claim is absolutely not a valid reason to ignore the \n77   jurisdictional bar of 1252(b)(9). Id. at 1032-33. In fact, the Singh Court denied Singh’s \n88   second ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it “arose before a final order of \n99   removal entered and [] could and should have been brought before the agency.” Id. at \n1111   1032, citing Singh, 499 F.3d at 974 (emphasis added). The J.E.F.M. Court went on to \n1122   explain, in considering a minor’s right to counsel in removal proceedings:  \n1133   It is true that at present neither the immigration judge nor the Board of \nImmigration Appeals has authority to order court-appointed counsel. But the \n1144  \nquestion at hand is a legal one involving constitutional rights. Even if not \n1155   raised in the proceedings below, the court of appeals has authority to consider \nthe issue because it falls within the narrow exception for “constitutional \n1166  \nchallenges that are not within the competence of administrative agencies to \n1177  \ndecide” and for arguments that are “so entirely foreclosed . . . that no remedies \n[are] available as of right” from the agency. \n1188  \n1199   Id. at 1038. As explained above, the court in Castellar arrived at the same conclusion \n2200   under similar circumstances, 2018 WL 786742 at *15, and this Court should as well.4  \n2211   C. Plaintiff’s Efforts to Reason Around Section 1252(b)(9) Should Fail. \n2222   In addition to challenging the applicability of section 1252(b)(9), Plaintiff also tries \n2233   to circumvent that provision by alleging that his “claims would persist even if no NTA \n2244   existed against him, and USCIS’s termination of his DACA status is not a mandatory \n2255  \n                                                 \n2266   4 Plaintiff’s assertion that it is Defendants’ position that Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA termination claim is not \nreviewable “in any court, at any time” pursuant to section 1252(g) is correct and unremarkable, as this \n2277   Court found the same in its first Preliminary Injunction Order. Dkt. No. 12 at 8. However, even if the \nCourt finds there is jurisdiction to consider the claim, Castellar, J.E.F.M., and Jennings are unequivocal \n2288  \nthat Congress explicitly prohibited this Court from hearing the claim. \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1369   Page 8 of 12\n \n11   consequence of the NTA against him.”5 Dkt. No. 50 at 8. However, Plaintiff has not \n22   shown how, had no NTA issued against him, he would have lost his DACA by some \n33   independent way. Theoretically, USCIS could have learned of Plaintiff’s criminal charges \n44   and initiated a review process and ultimately decided to terminate his DACA but not \n55   initiate removal proceedings, but that is simply not the situation here. Whether the Court \n66   agrees that it was permissible, it is indisputable that Defendants terminated Plaintiff’s \n77   DACA based on ICE’s finding him an enforcement priority and pursuing removal against \n88   him. See Dkt. 44 at 12-13. His challenges to that decision cannot be distinguished from a \n99   challenge to an action related to his removal proceedings such that section 1252(b)(9) \n1111   would not bar this Court’s jurisdiction. Castellar, 2018 WL 786742 at *14.6  \n1122   IV.  Plaintiff misstates important case holdings to assert APA jurisdiction.  \n1133   A. Heckler v. Chaney does not support jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  \n1144   In challenging Defendants’ argument that 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) precludes review of \n1155   the challenged actions here, Plaintiff misleadingly claims that the Supreme Court in \n1166   Heckler v. Chaney “explained that enforcement decisions are reviewable when governed \n1177   by ‘clearly defined factors.’” Dkt. 50 at 18, citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 834. However, the \n1188   Supreme Court in that passage was actually recounting a finding of reviewability under \n1199   section 701(a)(1), where “the language of the [Labor-Management Reporting and \n2200  \n                                                 \n2211   5 Plaintiff’s reliance on the Ninth Circuit’s holding in Sissoko is misplaced. Dkt. No. 50 at 8. The \nmandatory nature of Sissoko’s detention as a “direct[] result[] from the decision to commence \n2222  \nproceedings against him” supports Defendants’ position that the termination of his DACA—as a direct \n2233   result of the initiation of removal proceedings against him—is similarly barred by section 1252(g). \nSissoko v. Rocha, 509 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2007). Sissoko illustrates that section 1252(g) applies to \n2244   claims arising out of the decision to initiate removal proceedings. \n \n2255  \n6 Plaintiff’s reliance on Flores-Torres v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 708 (9th Cir. 2008), to support \n2266   distinguishing his claims from his removal proceedings is inapposite. See Dkt. 50 at 61 n.1. Flores-\nTorres involved a habeas petitioner who brought a claim of U.S. citizenship to challenge his detention \n2277   under 8 U.S.C. § 1226. 548 F.3d at 709. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that because sections 1226 and 1252 \nauthorize the detention (and removal) of aliens, the petitioner could bring his “non-frivolous claim of \n2288  \ncitizenship” in district court. Id. at 712. Plaintiff’s claim here is premised on his lack of U.S. citizenship, \n   thus his claims may not arise outside of the jurisdiction-limiting provisions of section 1252.  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1370   Page 9 of 12\n \n11   Disclosure Act] indicated that the Secretary was required to file suit if certain ‘clearly \n22   defined’ factors were present.” 470 U.S. 821, 834 (emphasis added); discussing Dunlop v. \n33   Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560 (1975). The Heckler Court further explained, “Our textual \n44   references to the ‘strong presumption’ of reviewability in Dunlop were addressed only to \n55   the § (a)(1) exception; we were content to rely on the Court of Appeals' opinion to hold \n66   that the § (a)(2) exception did not apply.” Id.  \n77   Defendants maintain that subsection (a)(1) applies here because section 1252 bars \n88   jurisdiction, and thus the holding in Chaney Plaintiff relies on is entirely inapposite. \n99   Defendants contend that subsection (a)(2) also applies because there is no requirement that \n1111   DACA be granted, or retained once granted, based on any factors, clearly defined or \n1122   otherwise. As Defendants have addressed in detail, the DACA SOP provides no standards \n1133   for determining who is an enforcement priority, and the ultimate decision to grant, deny, \n1144   or terminate DACA is left entirely to agency discretion. See, e.g., DACA SOP, Dkt. No. \n1155   39-6 at 195. Unremarkably, there is a variety of guidance that helps Defendants assess \nwho is an enforcement priority, that guidance changes over time, and that guidance does \n1166  \nnot curtail individualized determinations that consider factors outside operative guidance. \n1177  \nSee Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“In making immigration \n1188  \nenforcement decisions, the executive considers a variety of factors”); see also Dkt. No. \n1199  \n39-5 at 56 (“The decision whether to defer action in a particular case is individualized and \n2200  \ndiscretionary, taking into account the nature and severity of the underlying criminal, \n2211  \nnational security, or public safety concerns.”). Plaintiff cannot show that the guidance he \n2222  \nreferences specifically curtails Defendants’ exercise of discretion to determine that an \n2233  \nindividual is an enforcement priority. \n2244  \nB. Plaintiff’s Romeiro da Silva analysis is wrong and misleading.  \n2255  \nPlaintiff equates the DACA SOP instructions for considering a grant of deferred \n2266  \naction to the 1978 INS instructions that were found in Nicholas to constrict discretion, on \n2277  \nthe basis that these two documents have “two dispositive distinctions” from the 1981 \n2288  \nversion of deferred action instructions that were found not to constrict the agency’s \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1371   Page 10 of 12\n \n11   discretion. Dkt. No. 50 at 19-20. Plaintiff claims the 1978 version and the DACA SOP \n22   both confer “substantive benefits and [are] premised on humanitarian concerns,” and that \n33   both “are replete with mandatory language,” id., and, by silence, implies the 1981 \n44   instructions have neither. However, the Romeiro de Silva Court held only that the 1981 \n55   instructions had changed the referral language from 1978 (“the district director . . . shall \n66   recommend consideration for deferred action”) to 1981 (“[t]he district director may, in \n77   his discretion, recommend consideration of deferred action”). Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, \n88   773 F.2d 1021, 1023 n.1 (emphasis added). Similarly, the DACA SOP repeatedly states \n99   an individual who meets DACA criteria may be considered for a DACA grant. See, e.g., \n1111   Dkt. 39-5 at 24. The Court should reject Plaintiff’s attempt to discredit this controlling \n1122   authority.  \n1133   V.  Plaintiff fails to support his Due Process claims.  \nPlaintiff cites only to the denial of a motion to dismiss in Medina for its holding \n1144  \nthat a DACA grant confers a due process right on a DACA recipient. See Medina v. DHS, \n1155  \nNo. C17-0218RSM, 2017 WL 5176720, at *9 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017). The court \n1166  \nthere found that the plaintiff raised “a plausible due process claim,” but left unanswered \n1177  \n1188   the questions of “[w]hat process is due, and whether Plaintiff received such process.” Id. \nImportantly, the question in that case was whether the government could terminate \n1199  \nDACA without notice or an opportunity to respond. Id. (“[T]he government emphasized \n2200  \nthat it is allowed to withdraw DACA at any time for no reason at all. [] That cannot be.”).  \n2211  \nHaving received notice of the government’s intent to terminate his DACA, and an \n2222  \nopportunity to respond, Plaintiff here makes a much more invasive claim that he has a \n2233  \nmutually explicit understanding with the government that USCIS is required to define \n2244  \nenforcement priorities and to terminate DACA only when an individual falls within that \n2255  \ndefinition. See Dkt. No. 50 at 18-19. Such a construction does not exist in the DACA \n2266  \nSOP or DACA Memo, and is contradicted by the agency’s core discretionary authority to \n2277  \ndetermine who is an enforcement priority and when to initiate removal proceedings. See \n2288    \nJeronimo v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 330 F. App’x 821, 823–24 (11th Cir. 2009). \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1372   Page 11 of 12\n \n11   Plaintiff claims that enforcement priorities are defined in the DACA Memo and \n22   DACA SOP by virtue of those documents defining what makes an individual a “low \n33   priority” for immigration enforcement. See Dkt. 50 at 18. However, Plaintiff’s logic that \n44   an enforcement priority definition can be reverse engineered from a list of criteria that \n55   enables an individual to be considered for deferred action simply does not follow. As the \n66   DACA SOP explains, the criteria provide guidance for who may ultimately be considered \n77   for DACA, they do not establish entitlement to DACA. While a finding that someone is \n88   an enforcement priority may encompass findings that also establish a person no longer \n99   meets the DACA guidelines, it also may not.  \n1111   For example, the DACA SOP guidance considers whether deferred action under \n1122   DACA is warranted, in part, by considering whether an individual has been convicted of \n1133   “a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanors,” see \n1144   Dkt. No. 39-5 at 56; while also instructing that DACA may be terminated due to, among \n1155   other things, a finding of EPS that may be based on “information [that] indicates the alien \nis under investigation for, has been arrested for (without disposition), or has been \n1166  \nconvicted of” a list of enumerated criminal actions. See Dkt. No. 39-4 at 69-70, 89; see \n1177  \nalso Dkt No. 39-6 at 32 (“A DACA requestor’s criminal record may give rise to \n1188  \nsignificant public safety concerns even where there is not a disposition of conviction.”).  \n1199  \nBecause the enforcement priority finding is completely discretionary, committed to \n2200  \nthe judgment of DHS officers, and tied directly to the decision to initiate removal \n2211  \nproceedings, Plaintiff cannot show that he is entitled to any process in this Court to \n2222  \nchallenge that finding.  \n2233  \n \n2244  \n2255  \n2266  \n2277  \n2288  \n  \n3:17-CV-01840-JM-(NLS) \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 51   Filed 03/16/18   PageID.1373   Page 12 of 12\n \nDated: March 16, 2018      Respectfully submitted, \n11  \n \n22   CHAD A.

INTRODUCTION \n2  In his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), Plaintiff Alberto Luciano Gonzalez \n3  Torres (“Mr. Gonzalez”) asserts APA and constitutional claims arising from \n4  Defendants’ unlawful attempt to terminate his DACA status, employment \n5  authorization, and other benefits without complying with the procedures governing \n6  DACA termination.  In their Motion to Dismiss (“MTD”), Defendants repeat \n7  meritless jurisdictional arguments previously rejected by this Court and otherwise \n8  attempt to mischaracterize Mr. Gonzalez’s claims in this case, all in an effort to \n9  convince the Court to foreclose any judicial review of the serious legal violations \n10  asserted in the FAC.  The Court has already told Defendants that it has jurisdiction to \n11  consider Mr. Gonzalez’s claims—a decision Defendants chose not to challenge on \n12  appeal.  Nothing has changed since the Court made that decision in September, and \n13  Defendants’ MTD should be denied in its entirety. \n14  In granting Mr. Gonzalez’s first motion for a preliminary injunction under the \n15  original complaint, this Court made clear that the arguments Defendants raise in \n16  support of their motion under Rule 12(b)(1) fail under controlling Ninth Circuit law.  \n17  The Court held that neither 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) nor 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) strips it of \n18  jurisdiction to decide claims challenging the termination of DACA status.  Dkt. 12 at \n19  8-9 (docket pagination throughout).  In addition, the Court explained that the DACA \n20  SOP provides mandatory procedures governing the termination of DACA status, id. \n21  at 9-11, which constitute law to apply and render 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) inapplicable \n22  here.  These conclusions regarding the Court’s jurisdiction to decide claims premised \n23  on the unlawful termination of DACA status are law of the case.  They are also \n24  clearly correct and apply with full force to the FAC.  Unsurprisingly, every court to \n25  consider these issues has agreed with this Court’s determinations.  See IEIYC v. Duke, \n26  2017 WL 5900061 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (“IEIYC I”); IEIYC v. Nielsen, 2018 \n27  WL 1061408 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, 2018) (“IEIYC II”); Ramirez Medina v. DHS, 2017 \n28 \n \n  1 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1345   Page 7 of 23\n1  WL 5176720 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017); Coyotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328 \n2  (N.D. Ga. 2017). \n3  Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) argument that Mr. Gonzalez cannot state a \n4  constitutional claim as to the termination of his DACA status is also at odds with \n5  settled law and the operation of the DACA program.  To hold otherwise would \n6  countenance the perverse notion that Defendants may terminate DACA status on a \n7  whim or without regard to DACA’s governing documents—which this Court has \n8  rightly rejected, see Dkt. 12 at 10.  The only court to decide, so far, whether DACA \n9  status, once granted, confers constitutionally protected interests squarely held that it \n10  does and rejected Defendants’ contrary position.  See Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL \n11  5176720, at *9. \n12  For all of these reasons, the MTD should be denied in its entirety. \n13 \nII.  BACKGROUND \n14 \nMr. Gonzalez has provided a comprehensive “Statement of Facts” in his \n15 \npending motion for a preliminary injunction, calendared for hearing by the Court on \n16 \nthe same day as Defendants’ MTD.  See Dkt. 39-1 at 9-22.  In the interest of brevity, \n17 \nthat entire history is not recounted here.  In short, Mr. Gonzalez alleges in his FAC \n18 \nthat Defendants’ first termination of his DACA status in May 2016, which this Court \n19 \npreviously declared unlawful, and their purported second termination of his DACA \n20 \nstatus in December 2017—following the Court’s preliminary injunction and USCIS’s \n21 \nissuance of a bare-bones Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”)—must both be set \n22 \naside under the APA for violating the mandatory terms of the DACA SOP and being \n23 \narbitrary and capricious.  In addition, because Defendants’ purported denial of Mr. \n24 \nGonzalez’s DACA renewal application was premised solely on their unlawful \n25 \nDecember 2017 termination, it too must be set aside.  And if the Court determines \n26 \nthat Defendants have not violated the DACA SOP or acted in an arbitrary and \n27 \ncapricious manner, they have nevertheless violated Mr. Gonzalez’s procedural and \n28 \n \n  2 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1346   Page 8 of 23\n1  substantive due process rights by issuing him an NOIT with no indication of what \n2  facts USCIS would consider in deciding whether to terminate his DACA status, and \n3  then adjudging him a criminal and imposing serious consequences—i.e., the loss of \n4  DACA status and attendant benefits—based on, inter alia, a bureaucrat’s informal \n5  suspicion of wrongdoing, without any hearing, presentation of evidence, opportunity \n6  to confront witnesses or challenge the photographic lineup upon which Defendants \n7  apparently place great reliance, or criminal charges ever having been filed against \n8  him in any forum. \n9  As this Court will recall, DACA termination decisions (1) are made by USCIS \n10  (a division of the Department of Homeland Security) and are independent of any \n11  proceedings before the Immigration Court (which is part of the Department of \n12  Justice); and (2) are governed by the mandatory requirements of the DACA Memo \n13  and SOP.  DACA status may be granted to a person in removal proceedings or with a \n14  final order of removal, and it may be properly terminated even if a DACA recipient is \n15  never issued a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) in Immigration Court.  Mr. Gonzalez’s \n16  claims would persist even if no NTA existed against him, and USCIS’s termination of \n17  his DACA status is not a mandatory consequence of the NTA against him.  Mr. \n18  Gonzalez’s claims in this case therefore do not challenge or arise from ICE’s decision \n19  to issue an NTA.  And his challenges to USCIS’s repeated violations of the DACA \n20  SOP are collateral to the Immigration Court process. \n21  The manner in which Defendants have operated the DACA program for nearly \n22  six years makes clear that DACA does not exist solely for the administrative \n23  convenience of the government, but rather confers benefits based on mutually explicit \n24  understandings.  DACA status is based on a quid pro quo between the DACA \n25  beneficiary and the government—the DACA beneficiary hands over significant \n26  personal information, pays large fees, and passes rigorous background checks; the \n27  government assures lawful presence, employment authorization, and other benefits, in \n28  the absence of a disqualifying criminal offense or public safety or national security \n \n  3 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1347   Page 9 of 23\n1  concern.  DACA status, once granted, thus confers constitutionally protected \n2  interests. \n3 \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n4 \nA.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n5 \nIn evaluating Defendants’ MTD under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n6 \n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), the Court must “accept as true all facts alleged in the [FAC] \n7 \nand construe them in the light most favorable to [Mr. Gonzalez].”  Snyder & Assocs. \n8 \nAcquisitions LLC v. U.S., 859 F.3d 1152, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 2017).  The Court must \n9 \nresolve Defendants’ “facial attack” under Rule 12(b)(1) by “determin[ing] whether \n10 \nthe allegations are sufficient as a legal matter to invoke the court’s jurisdiction.”  \n11 \nLeite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2014).  As a “general rule,” the \n12 \nplaintiff is “master of a complaint for jurisdictional purposes.”  Hawaii ex rel. Louie \n13 \nv. HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 761 F.3d 1027, 1040 (9th Cir. 2014).  The Court must \n14 \ndeny Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) argument if the FAC contains “sufficient factual \n15 \nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  \n16 \nAshcroft v.

GONZALEZ HAS ARTICLE III STANDING TO \nCHALLENGE DEFENDANTS’ MAY 2016 AUTOMATIC \n20  TERMINATION OF HIS DACA STATUS \n21  Mr. Gonzalez maintains standing to seek a final declaratory judgment and \n22  permanent injunction against  Defendants’ automatic termination of his DACA status \n23  in May 2016.  The harms flowing from Defendants’ unlawful actions in May 2016 \n24  are inextricably linked to Mr. Gonzalez’s ongoing injuries.  Defendants’ desire to \n25  vindicate the lawfulness and propriety of that initial termination is shaping their \n26  actions with respect to Mr. Gonzalez’s reinstated DACA status and his DACA \n27  renewal application.  Indeed, by its own terms, Mr. Gonzalez’s NOIT explains \n28  Defendants’ view that the NOIT and opportunity to respond were “not strictly \n \n  4 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1348   Page 10 of 23\n1  required by the DACA SOP” and were provided only “to comply with the court \n2  order” in this case.  Dkt. 39-6 at 10.  Because the unlawful May 2016 termination \n3  informs Defendants’ current actions—i.e., the sham procedure by which they have \n4  purported to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status for a second time—the harms \n5  flowing from the initial termination are ongoing and must be remedied by a final \n6  declaratory judgment and permanent injunction.  See Anderson v. Evans, 371 F.3d \n7  475, 479 (9th Cir. 2004) (where “[p]recedential harms continue to flow from the \n8  government’s action,” a claim is not moot). \n9   \nC.  THIS COURT’S JURISDICTIONAL RULINGS ARE LAW OF \n10  THE CASE, AND NO CLEAR ERROR OR CHANGED \nCIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME \n11 \nThis Court correctly determined last September that neither 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \n12 \nnor 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) deprives it of jurisdiction over claims that Defendants \n13 \nviolated their own mandatory policies and procedures, the APA, and the Constitution \n14 \nin purporting to terminate Mr. Gonzalez’s DACA status through a process that—as \n15 \nthe Court noted and Defendants conceded—is not subject to review in Immigration \n16 \nCourt.  See Dkt. 12 at 8-9; Sept. 28, 2017 Hr’g Tr. at 16.  The Court also disposed of \n17 \nDefendants’ reliance on 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)—which creates a narrow exception to \n18 \nthe presumption of judicial review of agency action—by making clear that the DACA \n19 \nSOP provides law to apply to Mr. Gonzalez’s challenge and “categorically \n20 \nreject[ing]” Defendants’ assertion that “DHS possesses such broad prosecutorial \n21 \ndiscretion that they need not follow the DACA SOP in terminating the status of \n22 \nDACA recipients.”  Dkt. 12 at 10. \n23 \nDefendants contend that the Court should reconsider these determinations \n24 \nbecause of “clear error” and “changed circumstances.”  Dkt. 49-1 at 11 n.2.  Not so.  \n25 \nThe Court’s jurisdictional rulings were correct, as explained below, and consistent \n26 \nwith the results in other cases challenging DACA status determinations.  And the \n27 \nrelevant circumstances have not changed:  Mr. Gonzalez is still not challenging any \n28 \n \n  5 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1349   Page 11 of 23\n1  of the three specific actions enumerated in Section 1252(g), but rather Defendants’ \n2  failure to comply with the clear and mandatory terms of the DACA Memo and SOP; \n3  his claims are still collateral to the Immigration Court process; and the DACA SOP \n4  still provides the relevant law that Defendants must apply in making DACA \n5  termination determinations.  Defendants’ arguments that the Court should revisit its \n6  jurisdictional rulings should be rejected for at least the following reasons: \n7  First, this Court’s decisions regarding Sections 1252(g) and 1252(b)(9) are law \n8  of the case, which “requires that when a court decides on a rule, it should ordinarily \n9  follow that rule during the pendency of the matter” in the absence—as here—of “a \n10  change in controlling authority or the need to correct a clearly erroneous decision \n11  which would work a manifest injustice.”  Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136 F. Supp. 2d \n12  1152, 1153-54 (E.D. Cal. 2001).  While the Court’s order was preliminary, neither \n13  the law nor anything relevant to the Court’s jurisdictional determinations has changed \n14  since September 2017.  See id. (prior preliminary injunction established law of the \n15  case).  Mr. Gonzalez is still not challenging any of the “narrow[]” and “discrete \n16  actions” in Section 1252(g), Dkt. 12 at 8; and he is still not “seeking judicial review \n17  of [an] order[] of removal,” id. at 9.  He is again asserting that Defendants have \n18  violated their mandatory DACA procedures, and his claims still do not bear on the \n19  validity of his NTA or challenge his Immigration Court removal proceedings.1  There \n20  is no reason to disturb this Court’s decision that Sections 1252(g) and 1252(b)(9) do \n21  not deprive it of jurisdiction.  Far from “working a manifest injustice,” the Court \n22  correctly applied the law.2 \n23 \n                                         \n1 An Immigration Judge’s past or future discretionary decision to terminate or \n24 \nadministratively close Mr. Gonzalez’s removal proceedings after being apprised of \nhis situation does not change the fact that his claims in this Court are entirely \n25 \ncollateral to and independent of the removal proceedings.  Indeed, a claim may be \nindependent of removal proceedings even when its resolution might invalidate the \n26 \nproceedings.  See Flores-Torres v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 708, 711-13 & n.6 (9th Cir. \n2008). \n27 \n \n2 These principles are particularly apt given Defendants’ decision not to appeal the \n28 \nCourt’s legal determinations.  See Schering Corp. v. Ill. Antibiotics Co., 89 F.3d 357, \n358 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Under the doctrine of the law of the case, a ruling by the trial \n \n  6 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1350   Page 12 of 23\n1  Second, Defendants’ MTD inappropriately seeks reconsideration of the Court’s \n2  rulings.  See Dkt. 49-1 at 16, 17, 22 n.5 (“Defendants disagree with the Court’s prior \n3  citation to United States v. Hovsepian”; “the Court’s prior reliance on Ramirez-Perez \n4  v. Ashcroft … is also misplaced”; “[t]he Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. \n5  Gonzales … is misplaced”).  The motion comes too late.  See L.R. 7.1.i.2 (“any \n6  motion or application for reconsideration must be filed within 28 days after the entry \n7  of the ruling, order or judgment sought to be reconsidered”).  Moreover, in this Court, \n8  reconsideration is “disfavored unless a party shows there is new evidence, a change in \n9  controlling law, or establishes that the Court committed a clear error in the earlier \n10  ruling.”  None of those factors is present here. \n11 \nD.  NEITHER SECTION 1252(g) NOR SECTION 1252(b)(9) STRIPS \n12  THE COURT OF JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMS REGARDING \nTHE DACA SOP’S TERMINATION PROVISIONS \n13 \nEven beyond the insurmountable procedural barriers they face, Defendants’ \n14 \njurisdictional arguments are wrong on the merits. \n15 \n \n16  1.  Section 1252(g) \n17  The Ninth Circuit has made clear that “even a claim closely related to the \n18  initiation of removal proceedings is not barred by [Section] 1252(g), so long as it \n19  does not challenge the decision to commence proceedings itself.”  IEIYC II, 2018 WL \n20  1061408, at *15 (citing Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004)). \n21  U.S. v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2004) is illustrative and controlling.  \n22  There, “the only thing standing between [the plaintiff] and deportation [was] the \n23  district court’s order barring the INS from commencing deportation proceedings” on \n24  particular grounds.  Id. at 1155.  Because he sought “a description of the relevant \n25  law” (as applied to his criminal convictions) that would “form[] the backdrop against \n26  which the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary authority,” the Ninth \n27 \n                                                                                                                                       \n28 \ncourt, in an earlier stage of the case, that could have been but was not challenged on \nappeal is binding in subsequent stages of the case.”). \n \n  7 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1351   Page 13 of 23\n1  Circuit held that the district court had jurisdiction—even though the plaintiff sought \n2  an injunction against the commencement of removal proceedings.  Id.  In the FAC, \n3  Mr. Gonzalez is not asking this Court to undo his NTA.  Indeed, he is not challenging \n4  any aspect of the Immigration Court proceedings against him in this case.  He is \n5  asking this Court to (1) “consider a purely legal question” (was the termination of his \n6  DACA status unlawful—i.e., how does the DACA program define “enforcement \n7  priorities” for termination purposes?) (2) “that does not challenge [Defendants’] \n8  discretionary authority” (to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute \n9  removal orders).  Id.  And “even if the answer … forms the backdrop against which \n10  the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary authority,” this Court has \n11  jurisdiction.  Id. at 1155. \n12  Sissoko v. Rocha, 509 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 2007) confirms that Mr. Gonzalez’s \n13  claims are properly before this Court.  There, the Ninth Circuit held that Section \n14  1252(g) barred jurisdiction in the “limited context” of a challenge to detention that \n15  was statutorily “mandatory” upon the commencement of expedited removal \n16  proceedings, and therefore “arose from” that commencement.  Id. at 949-50.  By \n17  contrast, it is not “mandatory” that the commencement of removal proceedings for \n18  unlawful presence terminates DACA status—as made clear by this Court and every \n19  other to address the issue—so Mr. Gonzalez’s challenge to USCIS’s actions does not \n20  “arise from” that commencement.  See Dkt. 12 at 11. \n21  To sidestep this clear Ninth Circuit law, Defendants (1) assert that “the denial \n22  of DACA is a step ‘leading up to’ a final order of removal,” (2) mischaracterize Mr. \n23  Gonzalez’s claims as a challenge to ICE’s “decision to pursue his removal,” and (3) \n24  caution that “were the Court to find that a final removal against [Mr. Gonzalez] could \n25  not be executed based in some way on his claimed entitlement to DACA, then the \n26  issues raised here are certainly those for which this Court lacks jurisdiction.”  Dkt. \n27  49-1 at 20-21.  Each of these arguments is meritless.   \n28 \n \n  8 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1352   Page 14 of 23\n1  Point (1) is simply wrong.  Immigration Court proceedings and DACA status \n2  operate independently—i.e., a person with a final order of removal may receive \n3  DACA status, see Dkt. 39-4 at 3, and a person who has never been issued an NTA \n4  may have his DACA status properly terminated, id. at 90.  Point (2) ignores the text \n5  of the FAC, which challenges “USCIS’s purported termination decision” and “a \n6  USCIS agent’s determinations of credibility and criminality without a hearing or the \n7  ability to confront evidence.”  Dkt. 38 at 39, 42 (emphases added).  Mr. Gonzalez is \n8  “master of [his] complaint,” Hawaii ex rel. Louie, 761 F.3d at 1040, and nowhere in \n9  the FAC does he seek to undo ICE’s actions.  Finally, point (3) both (a) \n10  mischaracterizes the relief Mr. Gonzalez seeks in the FAC—which does not ask the \n11  Court to make any finding about the enforceability of a speculative, future removal \n12  order that an Immigration Judge might issue against him—and (b) ignores the fact \n13  that this Court has jurisdiction over questions of law “even if the answer … forms the \n14  backdrop against which the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary \n15  authority,” Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1155.  Indeed, “[w]hile [Section 1252(g)] bars \n16  courts from reviewing certain exercises of discretion by the attorney general, it does \n17  not proscribe substantive review of the underlying legal bases for those discretionary \n18  decisions and actions.”  IEIYC II, 2018 WL 1061408, at *16 (quoting Madu v. U.S. \n19  Atty. Gen., 470 F.3d 1362, 1368 (11th Cir. 2006)). \n20  Defendants’ reliance on Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir. 2001) \n21  is similarly misplaced.  There, on a petition for review, the Ninth Circuit simply \n22  explained that the petitioner had not alleged a “colorable” due process claim because \n23  he did “not contend that he was prevented from presenting his case before the \n24  immigration judge or the BIA, denied a full and fair hearing before an impartial \n25  adjudicator[,] or otherwise denied a basic due process right.”  Id. at 1271.  Mr. \n26  Gonzalez’s FAC does allege, inter alia, that he was prevented from presenting his \n27  case before an impartial adjudicator, and makes clear that he is not challenging any of \n28  the three discrete actions in Section 1252(g).  See Dkt. 38 at 39-43. \n \n  9 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1353   Page 15 of 23\n1  2.  Section 1252(b)(9) \n2  The Court should again quickly dispose of Defendants’ reliance on Sections \n3  1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9).  The “explicit language” of those provisions “appl[ies] \n4  only to those claims seeking judicial review of orders of removal.”  A. Singh v. \n5  Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007); see INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 \n6  (2001) (same).  They do not apply to “claims that are collateral to, or independent of, \n7  the removal process.”  JEFM v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 (9th Cir. 2016).  Because \n8  Mr. Gonzalez is not and never has been subject to an order of removal and is not \n9  challenging any part of the Immigration Court proceedings in this Court, his claims \n10  are not “bound up in and an inextricable part of [that] administrative process.”  Id. at \n11  1033; see Aguilar v. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (“arises from” requires \n12  tighter nexus than “related to”). \n13  In JEFM, the Ninth Circuit explained that Section 1252(b)(9) does not deprive \n14  district courts of jurisdiction where a claim could not have been litigated in removal \n15  proceedings, thus providing “no legal avenue to obtain judicial review of [the] \n16  claim.”  837 F.3d at 1032.  Accordingly, this Court explained that “contrary to \n17  [D]efendants’ position that immigration removal proceedings are the proper forum \n18  for Plaintiff to raise his DACA termination status, an immigration judge has no \n19  jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or to authorize an application for renewal of \n20  DACA status, as acknowledged by Defendants at oral argument.”  Dkt. 12 at 11.  \n21  Therefore, this Court should again reject Defendants’ cynical invitation to construe \n22  the INA “to deny any judicial forum for [Mr. Gonzalez’s] colorable constitutional \n23  [and APA] claim[s].”  Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988).  Such a reading of \n24  the statute would raise “serious constitutional concerns.”  Id.3 \n25 \n                                         \n3 To be clear, Defendants assert the radical position that Mr. Gonzalez’s claims are \n26 \nnot reviewable in any court, at any time.  To the extent they posit that a \nconstitutional challenge may be appropriate on a Petition for Review in the Court of \n27 \nAppeals following the Immigration Court removal process, see Dkt. 49-1 at 22, they \nignore that the Court of Appeals (1) would lack an adequate record on which to \n28 \naddress Mr. Gonzalez’s claims and (2) is institutionally ill-suited and statutorily \nprohibited to “order the taking of additional evidence,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1). \n \n  10 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1354   Page 16 of 23\n1  E.  SECTION 701(a)(2) DOES NOT PRECLUDE REVIEW OF \nCLAIMS REGARDING THE DACA SOP’S TERMINATION \n2  PROVISIONS \n3  Defendants’ assertion that 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) precludes review of Mr. \n4  Gonzalez’s claims is an equally unavailing effort to circumvent the “strong \n5  presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action.”  St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at \n6  298.  Section 701(a)(2) only precludes judicial review “to the extent that” a particular \n7  “action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  It is a “very narrow exception” \n8  that “applies in those rare instances where … in a given case there is no law to \n9  apply.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971).  \n10  It only applies where the agency has “absolutely no guidance as to how [] discretion \n11  is to be exercised.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis \n12  added).  In the Ninth Circuit, law to apply may be found in “internal operating \n13  procedures,” “policy statement[s],” and “usual practice”—i.e., “where discretion has \n14  been legally circumscribed by various memoranda.”  Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1161-62.  \n15  The absence of a specific statute or regulation “does not … mean that there are no \n16  meaningful standards against which to evaluate” an agency’s actions.  Mendez-\n17  Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 (9th Cir. 2003); see ASSE Intern., Inc. v. \n18  Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (“Even where statutory language grants \n19  an agency ‘unfettered discretion,’ its decision may nonetheless be reviewed if \n20  regulations or agency practice provide a ‘meaningful standard by which this court \n21  may review its exercise of discretion.’”). \n22  Here, the question before the Court is whether the DACA Memo and SOP \n23  provide any guidance as to how USCIS must make DACA termination \n24  determinations.  They plainly do.  This Court already disposed of Defendants’ \n25  arguments by making clear that the DACA SOP provides law to apply and \n26  “categorically reject[ing]” that “DHS possesses such broad prosecutorial discretion \n27  that they need not follow the DACA SOP in terminating the status of DACA \n28  recipients.”  Dkt. 12 at 10.  Every other court to address the issue has reached the \n \n  11 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1355   Page 17 of 23\n1  same conclusion.  See IEIYC II, 2018 WL 1061408, at *14-15 (citing this Court’s \n2  order and collecting cases; explaining that “the decision to revoke DACA is governed \n3  by both the Napolitano [DACA] Memo and the DACA SOP”); Batalla Vidal v. Duke, \n4  2017 WL 5201116, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2017) (“DHS’s prior statements” \n5  regarding the operation of DACA provide law to apply). \n6  Defendants cannot seriously contend—in the face of mounting judicial \n7  determinations and their own admissions—that the DACA Memo, DACA SOP, \n8  DACA FAQ, and other DHS statements, memos, and policy directives do not provide \n9  law to apply with respect to DACA termination determinations.  See Coyotl, 261 F. \n10  Supp. 3d at 1334 (“confirmation from counsel for Defendants that ‘[t]hey are the \n11  guidelines that adjudicators are to apply’”).  Even if Defendants had unfettered \n12  discretion over similar deferred action decisions before DACA, their establishment of \n13  and adherence to binding procedures, definitions, and restrictions brings their \n14  compliance squarely within the purview of 5 U.S.C. § 706.  See INS v. Yang, 519 \n15  U.S. 26, 32 (1996) (“Though the agency’s discretion is unfettered at the outset, if it \n16  announces and follows—by rule or by settled course of adjudication—a general \n17  policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed, an irrational departure \n18  from that policy (as opposed to an avowed alteration of it) could constitute action that \n19  must be overturned” under the APA.).  In addition, it is “well-established that even \n20  where agency action is committed to agency discretion by law, review is still \n21  available to determine if the Constitution has been violated.”  Batalla Vidal, 2017 \n22  WL 5201116, at *11. \n23  Against this backdrop, Defendants attempt to reframe Mr. Gonzalez’s claims as \n24  a challenge to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion—i.e., to ICE’s decision to issue \n25  an NTA for unlawful presence, which the FAC does not challenge—rather than to \n26  USCIS’s termination of his DACA status in violation of the DACA Memo and SOP.  \n27  The effort fails.  Defendants’ cases regarding challenges to discretionary decisions \n28  not to enforce are inapposite and shed no light on whether the DACA program is \n \n  12 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1356   Page 18 of 23\n1  bereft of “judicially manageable standards” to judge Defendants’ compliance with \n2  their own mandatory policies and defined enforcement priorities when they decided \n3  to enforce the termination provisions against Mr. Gonzalez.  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 \n4  U.S. 821, 830 (1985). \n5  In Heckler, the Supreme Court explained that enforcement decisions are \n6  reviewable when governed by “clearly defined factors.”  Id. at 834.  Regardless of the \n7  extent of Defendants’ discretion to issue an NTA for unlawful presence to a DACA \n8  recipient, DACA termination is governed by clearly defined factors in the DACA \n9  Memo and SOP.4  And Defendants’ invocation of a “complex balancing of policy \n10  considerations,” Dkt. 49-1 at 23, is a red herring.  Nothing about reading the DACA \n11  SOP’s and the Kelly Memo’s definitions of who does and does not constitute an \n12  enforcement priority is “peculiarly within [USCIS’s] expertise.”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at \n13  831.  Indeed, if the phrase “enforcement priorities” is as standardless as Defendants \n14  claim, no balancing of anything would be required before stripping a DACA recipient \n15  of his status.  That cannot be the law. \n16  Moreover, Defendants’ unmoored approach would run afoul of DHS’s \n17  statutory obligation to “establish[] national immigration enforcement policies and \n18  priorities,” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5), against which such determinations must be made.  It is \n19  Defendants’ burden to define the “enforcement priorities” that justify DACA \n20  termination, and they have done so in the DACA Memo and SOP.  They defined \n21  DACA recipients who meet the DACA Memo’s and SOP’s objectively verifiable \n22  criteria as low priority cases and enumerated a series of events—criminal convictions, \n23  findings of public safety or national security concern, or EPS findings—that could \n24  make them an enforcement priority.  Including additional language that permits \n25 \n                                         \n4 Therefore, Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822 (9th Cir. 2016) has no \n26 \napplication here.  There, to secure the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, \nthe plaintiff was challenging a valid reinstatement of removal issued in Immigration \n27 \nCourt, and her claims were entirely bound up in what was happening in her removal \nproceedings.  Id. at 825.  By contrast, in the FAC Mr. Gonzalez is not challenging \n28 \nany agency’s decision to issue an NTA or prosecute that NTA in Immigration Court. \n \n \n  13 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1357   Page 19 of 23\n1  termination when continued DACA status is not consistent with Defendants’ \n2  enforcement priorities does not relieve Defendants of their obligation to say what \n3  those priorities are and to terminate DACA only when an individual falls within one \n4  of the defined categories.  Defendants argue an untenable reading of the termination \n5  provision that would swallow the proverbial rule.  The Court should reject the \n6  argument out of hand. \n7  Finally, Defendants’ attempt to equate the DACA SOP with the 1981 deferred \n8  action instructions at issue in Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021 (9th Cir. \n9  1985) ignores two dispositive distinctions.  First, like the 1978 version at issue in \n10  Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979), DACA status confers substantive \n11  benefits and is premised on humanitarian concerns: \n12   \n•  DACA status confers lawful presence, the right to work in the United States, and \n13  access to various federal and state benefits. \n \n14  •  Defendants have taken affirmative steps and expended significant resources to, \ne.g., (1) conduct an “ongoing review of pending removal cases [and] offer[] \n15  administrative closure to many of them,” Dkt. 39-4 at 2; (2) operate a special \nhotline “staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week” to assist DACA-eligible \n16  individuals in removal proceedings, id. at 10; and (3) establish the comprehensive \nSOP to greatly circumscribe discretion regarding DACA status. \n17   \n•  The DACA Memo opens by explaining that DHS intends to protect “certain young \n18  people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \nhome” and “lacked the intent to violate the law.”  Dkt. 39-4 at 2. \n19  Second, as Defendants have conceded, the DACA Memo and SOP are replete \n20  with mandatory language.  See Coyotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1334 (“confirmation from \n21  counsel for Defendants that ‘[t]hey are the guidelines that adjudicators are to \n22  apply’”); see, e.g., Dkt. 39-4 at 2-3 (“necessary to ensure” non-prioritization of \n23  individuals who meet the DACA criteria).  The DACA Memo’s and SOP’s \n24  objectively verifiable criteria have therefore been the determinative basis for USCIS’s \n25  DACA decisions since its inception.  See Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 171-76 (5th \n26  Cir. 2015).  The DACA Memo and SOP provide ample law for USCIS to apply and \n27  against which this Court may judge USCIS’s actions when making DACA status and \n28  termination determinations.  Defendants’ efforts to deprive those standards of \n \n  14 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1358   Page 20 of 23\n1  meaning by asserting the right to terminate DACA whenever and however they \n2  please are contrary to law and logic.  Section 701(a)(2) imposes no barrier to this \n3  Court’s consideration of Mr. Gonzalez’s claims. \n4   \nF.  ONCE GRANTED, DACA STATUS CONFERS \n5  CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED INTERESTS \n6  Once granted, Mr. Gonzalez has a constitutionally protected interest in his \n7  DACA status, which is the result of a deal with the government, not unilateral \n8  expectation. So far, the only court to directly address whether DACA status, once \n9  conferred, may be terminated without any process under the Fifth Amendment has \n10  rejected DHS’s assertion “that there can be no violation of [a DACA recipient’s] Due \n11  Process rights because no process is actually due”: \n12  In creating the DACA policy/program, the federal government \nrecognized that there were thousands of young people unlawfully present \n13  in our country, that lacked the intent to violate the law, and that had \ncontributed to our country in significant ways, and that its immigration \n14  enforcement resources should not be spent on low priority cases such as \nthose.  The policy then set forth criteria to be considered when \n15  determining whether to grant DACA to an applicant.  These criteria \nestablished a quid pro quo from the federal government to the potential \n16  applicants—i.e., you (applicant) make yourself known to us (federal \ngovernment) and pass rigorous background checks, etc., and in return \n17  you will be considered for DACA, which in turn will allow you the \nopportunity to remain in the country, work, and potentially receive other \n18  state benefits. \nRamirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *9. \n19   \nDefendants’ behavior in operating DACA for the last six years is not consonant \n20 \nwith a program that exists solely for the administrative convenience of the \n21 \ngovernment, but rather one that confers benefits based on “mutually explicit \n22 \nunderstandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  Indeed, DHS \n23 \nrecently explained that it views DACA status as “confer[ring] affirmative benefits.”  \n24 \nPet. for Writ of Cert. at 12, DHS v. Regents, No. 17-1003 (U.S. Jan. 18, 2018), \n25 \navailable at https://goo.gl/Tjvaqg. \n26 \nDACA’s well-defined framework, specific operating procedures, and \n27 \nmandatory language “greatly restrict the discretion of the people who administer it” \n28 \n \n  15 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1359   Page 21 of 23\n1  and underscore the property interests conferred by DACA status.  Nozzi v. Housing \n2  Auth. of LA, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015); Wedges/Ledges of Calif., Inc. v. \n3  Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, 63 (9th Cir. 1994).  And the DACA Memo’s boilerplate that it \n4  “confers no substantive right” is plainly not determinative.  The question “turns on \n5  the substance of the interest recognized, not the name given that interest by the state.”  \n6  Newman v. Sathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d 786, 797 (9th Cir. 2002). \n7  The precise process that is due in Mr. Gonzalez’s circumstances need not be \n8  determined on Defendants’ MTD, which by its nature only addresses the threshold \n9  question of whether any process is due at all.  But Mr. Gonzalez emphasizes here that \n10  the Constitution cannot countenance a DACA status termination: \n11   \n•  on the basis of a USCIS officer’s suspicion, on a paper record, that Mr. Gonzalez \n12  engaged in criminal misconduct; \n \n13  •  after an Immigration Judge found him credible and not a threat to public safety, \nand released him on a $5,000 bond to resume his law-abiding life in San Diego;  \n14   \n•  nearly two years after he was arrested but never charged, with no further \n15  investigation beyond the two days of questioning following his May 2016 arrest, \nand no prior or subsequent law enforcement encounters or public safety concerns; \n16   \n•  without Mr. Gonzalez having the opportunity to know the facts that would guide \n17  the termination decision, to test the evidence against him or confront adverse \nwitnesses, or rebut factual allegations; and  \n18   \n•  without his having a hearing or any chance to persuade a neutral arbiter, rather \n19  than the same one who had already issued him a seemingly pre-determined notice \nof intent to terminate. \n20   \nSee Dkt. 39-1 at 32-34; Kaur v. Holder, 561 F.3d 957, 960-62 (9th Cir. 2009) \n21 \n(summary stating only that “reliable confidential sources have reported that [the \n22 \nimmigrant] has conspired to engage in alien smuggling; has attempted to obtain \n23 \nfraudulent documents; and has engaged in immigration fraud by conspiring to supply \n24 \nfalse documents for others” was “fundamentally unfair and violated her due process \n25 \nrights”).  Based on the allegations of the FAC, Mr. Gonzalez has stated a plausible \n26 \nconstitutional claim that must survive Defendants’ motion under Rule 12(b)(6). \n27 \n28 \n \n  16 \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 50   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.1360   Page 22 of 23\n1  IV.

Defendants U.S.\n22\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n23\n(“USCIS”), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and U.S. Customs\n24\nand Border Protection (“CBP”) oppose the motion and separately move to dissolve this\n25\ncourt’s  September  29,  2017  Order  Granting  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction\n26\n(“Order”) and to dismiss the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for failure to state a\n27\nclaim.    Having  carefully  considered  the  matter  presented,  the  court  record,  the\n28\n- 1 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1383   Page 2 of 17\n1 arguments of counsel and, for the reasons set forth below, the court denies the motion\n2 for preliminary injunction, grants the motion to dissolve the original preliminary\n3 injunction, and grants the motion to dismiss the FAC without leave to amend.  \n4 BACKGROUND\n5 On September 11, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this declaratory and injunctive\n6 relief action seeking a declaration that the automatic termination of his DACA status\n7 on May 7, 2016, without notice or an opportunity to contest the termination, (1) failed\n8 to comply with the DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOP”); (2) violated\n9 the arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion standard of the Administrative\n10 Procedure Act (“APA”); and (3) violated Plaintiff’s Procedural Due Process rights\n11 under the Fifth Amendment.  (ECF 1).1\n12 Following oral argument on Plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order,\n13 on  September  29,  2017,  the  court  granted  the  motion  for  injunctive  relief  and\n14 provisionally ordered:  (1) the reinstatement of Plaintiff’s DACA status; (2) the\n15 reinstatement of Plaintiff’s employment authorization; (3) the Defendants to comply\n16 with the DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) “should Defendants elect to\n17 reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status;” and, (4) Defendants to accept Plaintiff’s DACA\n18 renewal application.  (ECF 12).  Defendants complied with the Order by reinstating\n19 Plaintiff’s DACA status and employment authorization, and accepting his DACA\n20 renewal application.  The parties dispute whether the second DACA termination\n21 violated the DACA SOP.\n22 On November 13, 2017, USCIS issued Plaintiff a second Notice of Intent to\n23 Terminate (“NOIT”) informing him, among other things, that his DACA status was\n24 being revoked because he was an enforcement priority in light of his suspected\n25 involvement with alien smuggling.  The central issue relevant to the present motions\n26 is whether Defendants complied with the DACA SOP when terminating Plaintiff’s\n27\n28 1 Citations refer to the Electronic Case File Docket Number (“ECF”) and, where\napplicable, to an Exhibit or to the scanned header page number.\n- 2 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1384   Page 3 of 17\n1 DACA status a second time, after this court had invalidated Defendants’ initial\n2 termination of Plaintiff’s DACA status.  After providing Plaintiff with notice and an\n3 opportunity to respond to the NOIT, on December 21, 2017, Defendants revoked and\n4 terminated Plaintiff’s DACA status for a second time.\n5 The FAC, filed on January 12, 2018, alleges four claims for relief arising out of\n6 the revocation of his DACA status: (1) violation of the APA, based upon the May 2016\n7 DACA violation; (2) violation of the APA, based upon the December 21, 2017 DACA\n8 violation; (3) violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (4) \n9 declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that the revocation of his DACA was unlawful. \n10 The following provides background relevant to the parties’ arguments. \n11 Plaintiff Obtains DACA Status\n12 Plaintiff is a 24-year-old citizen of Mexico who was brought to the United States\n13 by his family when he was eight years old.  Plaintiff and his family entered the United\n14 States without authorization from the Attorney General.  Since his entry into the United\n15 States, Plaintiff has lived in San Diego, California where he graduated from Altus\n16 Charter High School in 2011.  From 2011 to 2013, Plaintiff was unable to obtain lawful\n17 employment due to his immigration status.  Plaintiff has no criminal convictions and\n18 had never been arrested until the 2016 detention in this case.\n19 In June 2012, the Obama Administration created the DACA program which\n20 allowed certain immigrants to avoid deportation and obtain work permits for a period\n21 of two years, renewable upon good behavior.  The contours of the DACA program\n22 were set out in a June 15, 2012 Memorandum from former Secretary of the DHS, Janet\n23 Napolitano, and which became known as the “Napolitano Memo.”  The Napolitano\n24 Memo provided the criteria to be satisfied before an individual could be considered for\n25 an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  In broad brush, one qualified for DACA status\n26 upon showing that the individual:\n27 - entered the United States before his or her 16th birthday and prior to June 2007; \n28 - lived continuously in the United States during the previous five years; \n- 3 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1385   Page 4 of 17\n1 - was currently in school, a high school graduate or was honorably discharged\n2 from the military;\n3 - was under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; and \n4 - had not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three or more\n5 misdemeanors, nor posed a threat to national or public safety.  \n6 The program did not, and still does not, provide lawful status or a path to citizenship,\n7 nor does it provide eligibility for federal welfare or student aid.  (ECF 39-4, Exh. A).\n8 In early 2013, satisfying all prerequisites for DACA status, Plaintiff applied for,\n9 and  was  granted,  DACA  status.    Having  obtained  DACA  status,  Plaintiff  was\n10 considered “lawfully present” in the country and granted an Employment Authorization\n11 Document  (“EAD”)  and  Social  Security  Number,  which  allowed  Plaintiff  to  be\n12 lawfully employed.  The approval letter issued by USCIS informed Plaintiff that “in the\n13 exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, [USCIS] has decided to defer action on” his\n14 case  for  a  period  of  two  years.    “Deferred  action  does  not  confer  or  alter  any\n15 immigration status.”  (Id. Exh. I).  In 2014, DHS renewed Plaintiff’s DACA status.\n16 Upon receipt of DACA status, Plaintiff obtained full-time employment in the\n17 airline food packaging industry and worked in that industry from 2013 until May 2016,\n18 working the 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. shift.  The hiring process involved interviews, drug\n19 tests, background checks, and verification of employment authorization.  Plaintiff used\n20 a portion of his income to financially support his family.  In May 2016, Plaintiff’s\n21 DACA status was purportedly revoked by the USCIS in a Notice of Action.  Plaintiff\n22 informed his employer of the loss of DACA status and was, in turn, terminated by his\n23 employer.  Plaintiff’s employer did, however, inform Plaintiff he could re-apply for\n24 employment once he obtained work authorization.  \n25 The First Revocation of Plaintiff’s DACA Status\n26 On May 6, 2016, Plaintiff declares that an acquaintance named Adolfo asked\n27 him, as he had in the past, to look after his dogs while he was out of town.  Plaintiff\n28 went to Adolfo’s home, took care of the dogs, and encountered two other individuals\n- 4 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1386   Page 5 of 17\n1 at the home.  Plaintiff planned to have his sister pick him up from Adolfo’s house and\n2 drive him to work by 7:00 p.m., the shift start time.  At 4:00 p.m., a few hours after\n3 arriving at Adolfo’s house, USCBP officers knocked on the door and asked Plaintiff\n4 if they could search the premises.   He informed the USCBP officers that they needed\n5 a search warrant to enter the home as he did not believe he “had permission to let them\n6 in because it was not my house.”  (ECF 39-2, Gonzalez Decl. ¶11).  The Officers did\n7 not enter the home, but remained outside.\n8 Around 5:00 p.m. a man not known to Plaintiff arrived, represented that he was\n9 the owner of the house, and asked Plaintiff to exit his home.  Outside the home,\n10 Plaintiff  was interviewed by USCBP officers and informed them that he possessed\n11 DACA  status  and  a  valid  EAD.    According  to  Plaintiff,  he  was  then  arrested,\n12 handcuffed, and spent the next two days being “aggressively” interrogated by two\n13 officers.  The officers asked him about “wrongdoing at the house that I did not\n14 understand.  I kept asking them for details and telling them, ‘I don’t understand why\n15 I’m being detained.’” (Id. ¶18).  “No one interrogated [Plaintiff] after those first two\n16 or three days,” or after his release from custody.\n17 After two or three days, Plaintiff was transferred to another facility.  On June 1,\n18 2016,  Plaintiff  was  provided  with  a  bond  hearing  before  Immigration  Judge\n19 McSeveney, and released two days later on a $5,000 bond.  Since his release, Plaintiff\n20 has not had any law enforcement contacts.  \n21 To provide additional context to Plaintiff’s declaration, Defendants represent that\n22 Plaintiff (and another individual arrested at the searched house) was arrested on May\n23 6, 2016, for harboring illegal aliens in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and\n24 §1182(a)(6)(E)(i).  Once the owner of the home arrived at Adolfo’s residence, the\n25 owner consented to permit USCBP agents to search the residence (the renters were not\n26 at home).  Inside, USCBP discovered 12 illegal aliens (five from China and seven from\n27 Mexico) hiding in the attic. The record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien  documents\n28 indicate that three material witnesses identified Plaintiff as the individual who told\n- 5 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1387   Page 6 of 17\n1 them to hide in the attic.  \n2 On May 7, 2016, USCIS issued Plaintiff a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) charging\n3 him as “inadmissible” to the United States  (i.e. Plaintiff was deemed unlawfully\n4 present in the country) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i).  On May 23, 2016,\n5 USCIS provided Plaintiff with a Notice of Action informing him that his DACA status\n6 and employment authorization had been automatically terminated as of the date of the\n7 NTA (May 7, 2016).    \n8 The DACA SOP\n9 The DACA SOP issued by DHS sets forth the procedures for adjudicating\n10 DACA applications, renewals, and the termination of participation in DACA.  Among\n11 other things, the DACA SOP provision at issue here provides for termination of DACA\n12 status in the event the recipient is considered an enforcement priority by USCIS, after\n13 consultation with ICE:\n14 If  after  consulting  with  ICE,  USCIS  determines  that  exercising\nprosecutorial discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is\n15 not consistent with the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement\npriorities, and ICE does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer should refer\n16 the  case  to  HQSCOPS,  through  the  normal  chain  of  command,  to\ndetermine whether or not a NOIT is appropriate. If it is determined that\n17 the case warrants final termination, the officer will issue DACA 603 -\nTermination  Notice  [Enforcement  Priority;  Not  Automatically\n18 Terminated] from the Appendix I.\n19 In addition, the DACA recipient must be provided with notice and an ability to contest\n20 the NOIT before DACA status may be terminated. \n21 Recent DACA Related Events\n22 On September 5, 2017, Defendant DHS announced a plan to eliminate DACA,\n23 beginning in March 2018.  DACA recipients whose status would expire on or before\n24 March 5, 2018, could have applied for a two-year renewal, but renewal applications\n25 were due on or before October 5, 2017.  (ECF 39-4, Exh. C).2  \n26\n27 2 The court notes that two federal courts have enjoined the termination of the\nDACA program.  See Batalla-Vidal v. Nielsen, 16cv4756 (E.D.N.Y. February 13,\n28 2018); Regent of University of Cal. v. DHS, 17cv05221 WHA (N.D. Cal. January 9,\n2018).\n- 6 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1388   Page 7 of 17\n1 On February 20, 2017, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly issued a\n2 memorandum entitled Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National\n3 Interest  (the  “Kelly  Memo).”    The  Kelly  Memo  prioritizes  enforcement  against\n4 individuals who “have been charged with any criminal offense that has not been\n5 resolved” or allegedly “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” \n6 The Kelly Memo also provides that DHS is authorized to commence enforcement\n7 actions against removable aliens. \n8 Unless  otherwise  directed,  Department  personnel  may  initiate\nenforcement actions against removable aliens encountered during the\n9 performance of their official duties and should act consistently with the\nPresident's enforcement priorities identified in his Executive Order and\n10 any further guidance issued pursuant to this memorandum. Department\npersonnel have full authority to arrest or apprehend an alien whom an\n11 immigration officer has probable cause to believe is in violation of the\nimmigration  laws.  They  also  have  full  authority  to  initiate  removal \n12 proceedings against  any alien  who is subject  to  removal under  any\nprovision  of  the  INA,  and  to  refer  appropriate  cases  for  criminal\n13 prosecution.\n14 (ECF 39-4, Exh. D at 4).  The Memo also highlights that prosecutorial discretion\n15 should be exercised on a case-by-case basis:\n16 The exercise of prosecutorial discretion with regard to any alien who is\nsubject to arrest, criminal prosecution, or removal in accordance with law\n17 shall be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the head of the\nfield office component, where appropriate, of CBP, ICE, or USCIS that\n18 initiated or will initiate the enforcement action, regardless of which entity \nactually files any applicable charging documents: CBP Chief Patrol\n19 Agent, CBP Director of Field Operations, ICE Field Office Director, lCE\nSpecial Agent-in-Charge, or the USCIS Field Office Director, Asylum\n20 Office Director or Service Center Director. \n21 In light of the numerous recent government issued memoranda concerning\n22 modifications to immigration policies, laws, regulations and procedures, the court notes\n23 that these memoranda preserve the DACA program.  On June 15, 2017, Secretary Kelly\n24 issued a memorandum rescinding the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\n25 Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”), but temporarily leaving the DACA program\n26 in place.  (ECF 39-4, Exh. I).\n27 The Second Revocation of Plaintiff’s DACA Status\n28 As noted above, following this court’s September 29, 2017 Order granting\n- 7 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1389   Page 8 of 17\n1 injunctive relief, Defendants reinstated Plaintiff’s DACA status and employment\n2 authorization.  Thereafter, on December 21, 2017, USCIS issued Plaintiff a NOIT,\n3 informing him that his DACA status was being terminated.  The NOIT informed\n4 Plaintiff  that  USCIS  had  consulted  with  ICE  and  “determined  that  exercising\n5 prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action in your case is not consistent with\n6 DHS’s enforcement policies.”  (ECF 39-6).  In support of its decision, USCIS cited the\n7 following DACA SOP to support its position: \n8 If  after  consulting  with  ICE,  USCIS  determines  that  exercising\nprosecutorial discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is\n9 not consistent with the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement\npriorities, and ICE does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer should refer\n10 the  case  to  HQSCOPS,  through  the  normal  chain  of  command,  to\ndetermine whether or not a NOIT is appropriate. If it is determined that\n11 the case warrants final termination, the officer will issue DACA 603 -\nTermination  Notice  [Enforcement  Priority;  Not  Automatically\n12 Terminated] from the Appendix I.\n13 The  NOIT  articulated  Plaintiff’s  involvement  in  “what  appeared  to  be  a\n14 smuggling event” on May 6, 2017.  The NOIT provided Plaintiff with notice that he\n15 was an enforcement priority in light of his suspected criminal activity.  The NOIT also\n16 identified Plaintiff’s involvement in suspected alien smuggling, including statements\n17 by several of the illegal immigrants that Plaintiff directed them to hide in the attic when\n18 the CBP officers arrived on the site.\n19 On December 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed a response to the NOIT.  In the main, the\n20 response represented that Plaintiff continued to satisfy all objectively verifiable DACA\n21 criteria.  Notably, Plaintiff denies any involvement in alien smuggling.\n22 The Termination Notice\n23 After receipt of Plaintiff’s response to the NOIT, on December 21, 2017, USCIS\n24 issued a Termination Notice to Plaintiff.  The Termination Notice informed Plaintiff\n25 that USCIS consulted with ICE and determined that exercising prosecutorial discretion\n26 was “not consistent with the DHS’s enforcement priorities.”  (ECF 39-6).  In reaching\n27 the conclusion to revoke Plaintiff’s DACA status, the Termination Notice repeated and\n28 expanded upon the “derogatory information” concerning the alien smuggling events\n- 8 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1390   Page 9 of 17\n1 of May 6, 2016.  The Termination Notice referred to the I-213 forms (Record of\n2 Deportable/Inadmissible Alien) which identified Plaintiff’s purported involvement in\n3 alien smuggling  activities.   Plaintiff was also informed that he would have  the\n4 opportunity to contest his removal in Immigration Court pursuant to INA §240.\n5 Pending Immigration Proceedings\n6 On May 7, 2016, CBP provided Plaintiff with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”),\n7 thereby commencing removal proceedings against him pursuant to INA §240.  On\n8 November 7, 2016, the immigration proceedings against Plaintiff were terminated. \n9 However, “ICE once again confirmed it still views [Plaintiff] as an enforcement\n10 priority and issued [Plaintiff] a new NTA on December 8, 2017.”  (Pls. Exh. R). \n11 Plaintiff had a hearing scheduled before an Immigration Judge calendared for March\n12 20, 2018, but that date has been continued.\n13 Procedural History of This Action\n14 On September 29, 2017, the court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary\n15 Injunction  and  (1)  vacated  Defendants’  initial  DACA  revocation;  (2)  reinstated\n16 Plaintiff’s employment authorization; (3) instructed Defendants to comply with the\n17 DACA SOP, in the event Defendants were to elect to revoke Plaintiff’s DACA status;\n18 and (4) ordered Defendants to accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application.  The\n19 dispute amongst the parties centers on whether the second revocation of Plaintiff’s\n20 DACA status complied with the DACA SOP.\n21 DISCUSSION\n22 Legal Standards\n23 Preliminary Injunction\n24 To obtain preliminary or temporary injunctive relief, the party must satisfy one\n25 of two tests: (1) a combination of probable success and the possibility of irreparable\n26 harm, or (2) the party raises serious questions and the balance of hardship tips in its\n27 favor.  Arcamuzi v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 937 (9th Cir. 1987).\n28 \"These two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required\n- 9 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1391   Page 10 of 17\n1 degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.\"  Id. \n2 Under both formulations, however, the party must demonstrate a \"fair chance of\n3 success on the merits\" and a \"significant threat of irreparable injury.\"  Id; Miller v.\n4 California Pac. Med. Ctr., 19 F.3d 449, 456 (9th Cir. 1994 (en banc).  The court also\n5 considers the public interest in the issues raised by the parties.  Winter v. NRDC, Inc.,\n6 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).\n7 Review under the APA\n8 Under the APA, “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or\n9 adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant\n10 statute, is entitled to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. §702.  The APA further states\n11 “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there\n12 is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.”  Id. § 704. \n13 Section  706  instructs  the  court  reviewing  agency  action  to  “decide  all  relevant\n14 questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the\n15 meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  Not only shall the\n16 reviewing  court  compel  agency  action  unlawfully  withheld  but  shall  also  “hold\n17 unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be – (A) \n18 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n19 Id. §§706(1) and (2)(A).  \n20 Motion to Dismiss\n21 Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6)  dismissal  is  proper  only  in\n22 \"extraordinary\" cases. United States v. Redwood City, 640 F.2d 963, 966 (9th Cir.\n23 1981).  Courts should grant 12(b)(6) relief only where a plaintiff's complaint lacks a\n24 \"cognizable legal theory\" or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory. \n25 Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  Courts should\n26 dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim when the factual allegations are\n27 insufficient “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atlantic Corp.\n28 v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (the complaint’s allegations must “plausibly\n- 10 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1392   Page 11 of 17\n1 suggest[]” that the pleader is entitled to relief); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)\n2 (under Rule 8(a), well-pleaded facts must do more than permit the court to infer the\n3 mere possibility of misconduct).  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability\n4 requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n5 unlawfully.”  Id. at 678.  Thus, “threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,\n6 supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.  The defect must appear\n7 on the face of the complaint itself.  Thus, courts may not consider extraneous material\n8 in testing its legal adequacy.  Levine v. Diamanthuset, Inc., 950 F.2d 1478, 1482 (9th\n9 Cir. 1991).  The courts may, however, consider material properly submitted as part of\n10 the complaint.  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner and Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555\n11 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n12 Finally, courts must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the\n13 plaintiff.  Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1500 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. dismissed, 116 \n14 S. Ct. 1710 (1996).  Accordingly, courts must accept as true all material allegations in\n15 the complaint, as well as reasonable inferences to be drawn from them. Holden v.\n16 Hagopian, 978 F.2d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir. 1992).  However, conclusory allegations of\n17 law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  In\n18 Re Syntex Corp. Sec. Litig., 95 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir. 1996).\n19 The APA Claim\n20 The determinative issue raised in all three pending motions is whether the second\n21 DACA revocation complied with the DACA SOP.  In its September 29, 2017 Order,\n22 the  court  instructed  Defendants  to  “fully  comply  with  the  DACA  SOP  should\n23 Defendants elect to reconsider Plaintiff’s DACA status.”  (ECF 12; Order at p.13:27-\n24 28).   Defendants then issued a new NOIT to Plaintiff, afforded him an opportunity to\n25 respond, considered Plaintiff’s response, and terminated Plaintiff’s DACA status as of\n26 December 22, 2017, subject to further order of this court.  Defendants represent that\n27 the record demonstrates they complied with the provisions of the DACA SOP such that\n28 the agencies’ conduct was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor a violation of law.  Plaintiff\n- 11 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1393   Page 12 of 17\n1 takes a contrary view. \n2 Defendants assert that they fully complied with the following DACA SOP in\n3 revoking Plaintiff’s DACA status a second time:\n4 If  after  consulting  with  ICE,  USCIS  determines  that  exercising\nprosecutorial discretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is\n5 not consistent with the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement\npriorities, and ICE does not plan to issue an NTA, the officer should refer\n6 the  case  to  HQSCOPS,  through  the  normal  chain  of  command,  to\ndetermine whether or not a NOIT is appropriate. If it is determined that\n7 the case warrants final termination, the officer will issue DACA 603 -\nTermination  Notice  [Enforcement  Priority;  Not  Automatically\n8 Terminated] from the Appendix I.\n9 Defendants make a substantial showing that they complied with this DACA\n10 SOP.  The NOIT identifies the above provision of the DACA SOP as the ground for\n11 terminating Plaintiff’s DACA status, and represents that USCIS consulted with ICE\n12 and determined that “exercising prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action in your\n13 case is not consistent with DHS’s enforcement policies.”  (ECF at 39-6).  The basis for\n14 Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff is an “enforcement priority” arises from Plaintiff’s\n15 purported involvement with alien smuggling on May 6, 2016.  \n16 Plaintiff challenges and seeks to limit the term “enforcement priority,” as applied\n17 to DACA recipients, to mean “a disqualifying criminal conviction, a public safety\n18 concern finding, a national security concern finding or an EPS (Egregious Public\n19 Safety) finding.”  (Reply at p.7:20-23).  In other words, because Plaintiff has not been\n20 convicted of a crime, he contends that he is not an enforcement priority and, therefore,\n21 he has been wrongfully dispossessed of his DACA status.  Further, Plaintiff argues that\n22 he is entitled to retain his “low enforcement priority” status under DACA.  This\n23 argument is unpersuasive.\n24 While DACA expressly identifies that DACA recipients are considered low\n25 enforcement priority, the DACA SOP identifies several ways that a DACA recipient\n26 loses that protected status.  Not only does the DACA SOP identify that a DACA\n27 recipient loses DACA status once the recipient becomes an enforcement priority, but\n28 the Kelly Memo expressly identifies that alien individuals who “have committed acts\n- 12 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1394   Page 13 of 17\n1 which constitute a chargeable criminal offense” are enforcement priorities.   (ECF 39-4,\n2 Exh.D at p. 31).3  Furthermore, the November 7, 2011 USCIS Notice to Appear\n3 guidelines identify that an alien’s alleged role in alien smuggling (a violation of INA\n4 §§101(a)(43)(N) and (O))is one of the offenses that triggers the characterization of an\n5 alien as a “top immigration enforcement priority,” even without a conviction.  (ECF 39-\n6 4 at 61-62). \n7 The arbitrary and capricious standard of 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A) is a narrow one. \n8 Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 418 U.S. 281, 285\n9 (1974).  The court’s role under the APA is to determine whether the agency considered\n10 all relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.  “Although\n11 this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review\n12 is a narrow one.  The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the\n13 agency.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971).  The\n14 agency must articulate a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice\n15 made.”  Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).\n16 Here, the court concludes that Defendants considered all relevant factors in\n17 determining that Plaintiff was an enforcement priority within the meaning of the\n18 DACA SOP and Kelly Memo.  The record before the court reveals that relevant\n19 agencies (USCIS, ICE, and CBP) consulted with each other and determined that\n20 Plaintiff committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.  Defendants\n21 determined that several of the material witness aliens detained on May 6, 2016,\n22 identified Plaintiff as one of the individuals actively engaged in human trafficking\n23 conduct.    The  Termination  Notice  rationally  articulates  Plaintiff’s  perceived\n24 involvement in human trafficking, in violation of relevant statutes and regulations, and\n25 therefore,  supports  Defendants’  determination  that  Plaintiff  engaged  in  conduct\n26\n3 While the government does not rely on the Kelly Memo to buttress its decision,\n27 the Kelly Memo is instructive in that it expressly instructs that DHS “no longer will\nexempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,”  and\n28 highlights that ICE, CBP, and USCIS have the discretion “to prioritize enforcement\nactivities.”  Id. \n- 13 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1395   Page 14 of 17\n1\nconstituting a chargeable criminal offense.  See Judulang v, Holder, 562 U.S. 42, 52-53\n2\n(2011) (an agency must exercise reasoned decision-making).\n3\nThe DACA SOP,  the Kelly Memo, and the INA provide a clear indication that\n4\nthe  Defendant  agencies  possess  substantial  discretion  to  determine  whether  the\n5\nrevocation of an individual’s DACA status is consistent with DHS’s enforcement\n6\npriorities.  The DACA program specifically provides that ICE and USCIS possess the\n7\ndiscretion to determine whether the continued exercise of prosecutorial discretion is\n8\nconsistent with DHS’s enforcement priorities in any particular case.  (ECF 39-4 at 81). \n9\nThe  INA  also  provides  that  “[t]he  Attorney  General  shall  be  charged  with  the\n10\nadministration and enforcement” of the statute and that the “determination and ruling\n11\nby the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.” 8 \n12\nU.S.C.  §  1103(a)(1).    The  court  notes  that  some  deference  is  due  Defendants’\n13\ninterpretations and determinations under the circumstances of this case, particularly\n14\nwhere agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.  See 5 U.S.C. §701(a);\n15\n8  U.S.C.  §1252(g).    Judicial  deference  to  the  Executive  Branch  is  especially\n16\nappropriate in the immigration context.  See I.N.S. v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415,\n17\n425 (1999).  Here, the court cannot conclude that Defendants violated the APA by\n18\ndetermining that Plaintiff’s involvement in alien smuggling made him an enforcement\n19\npriority  for  purposes  of  the  DACA  program.    Defendants  articulated  a  rational\n20\nconnection between Plaintiff’s involvement with alien smuggling and the decision to\n21\nrevoke Plaintiff’s DACA status.\n22\nAdditionally, Plaintiff makes the argument that the allegations in Plaintiff’s\n23\narrest record have yet to be tested in a competent forum.  However, this is not the\n24\nappropriate forum to test the veracity of Defendants’ underlying assertions that Plaintiff\n25\nengaged in conduct that constituted a violation of the immigration laws.  Pursuant to\n26\n8 U.S.C. §1252(g) and 5 U.S.C. §701(a)(2), this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a\n27\ndetermination on the merits of Plaintiff’s alleged criminal conduct.  See Rodriguez v.\n28\nSessions, 677 Fed.Appx. 447, ––––, 2017 WL 695192, at *1 (9th Cir. 2017) (“We lack\n- 14 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1396   Page 15 of 17\n1\njurisdiction to consider [the plaintiff's] eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood\n2\nArrivals.”); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 Fed.Appx. 898, 901 (3rd Cir. 2016) (“[Section\n3\n1252(g) ] deprives all courts of jurisdiction to review a denial of DACA relief because\n4\nthat decision involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a deferred\n5\naction.”); Fabian-Lopez v. Holder, 540 Fed.Appx. 760, 761 n.2 (9th Cir. 2013)\n6\n(determining that Section 1252(g) deprived the court of jurisdiction to consider the\n7\nplaintiff's DACA eligibility).   Plaintiff may obtain review of this claim by filing a\n8\npetition for review with the Ninth Circuit.  See 8 U.S.C. §1252(a)(5).\n9\nIn the prior Order, the court concluded that Defendants violated the APA when\n10\nthey failed to comply with the DACA SOP.  The court did not reach, nor does it now,\n11\nthe merits of Plaintiff’s underlying conduct on May 6, 2016.  Defendants have made\n12\na sufficient showing that they followed the DACA SOP, consulted with the appropriate\n13\nagencies, issued a DACA compliant Notice of Termination, provided Plaintiff with the\n14\nopportunity to respond to the Notice of Termination, considered Plaintiff’s response,\n15\nand provided Plaintiff a Termination Notice explaining the reasons for the termination\n16\nof his DACA status.  Under APA review, the court cannot conclude that such agency\n17\naction was arbitrary, capricious, or a violation of law under 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A)\n18\nbecause Defendants complied with the DACA SOP.\n19\nThe Constitutional Claim\n20\nThe bedrock principle underlying procedural due process is clear: “Parties whose\n21\nrights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that\n22\nright they must be notified.”  Baldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall 223, 233 (1863).  Equally\n23\nfundamental to the right to notice is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time\n24\nin a meaningful manner.  Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965); Mathews v.\n25\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).  When protected liberty or property interests are\n26\nimplicated, the individual is entitled to “some kind of prior hearing” before the\n27\ntermination of such interests.  Board of Regent of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\n28\n(1972).\n- 15 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1397   Page 16 of 17\n1\nThe  court  is  unpersuaded  by  Defendants’  argument  that  DACA  is  purely\n2\ndiscretionary such that recipients of DACA possess no liberty, property, or other\n3\nconstitutional interest. The Napolitano Memo provides five criteria that must be\n4\nsatisfied before an illegal immigrant qualifies to obtain DACA status (entered the\n5\nUnited States before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007; lived continuously in\n6\nthe United States during the previous five years; was currently in school, a high school\n7\ngraduate or was honorably discharged from the military; was under the age of 31 as of\n8\nJune 15, 2012; and not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three\n9\nor more misdemeanors, nor posed a threat to national or public safety).  Once these\n10\nobjective and non-discretionary criteria are satisfied, the DACA recipient enjoys\n11\nsignificant  liberty  and  property  interests,  including  the  right  to  obtain  lawful\n12\nemployment authorization and the right to be considered lawfully present in the United\n13\nStates.\n14\nIn light of the liberty and property interests at stake, the court concludes that\n15\nPlaintiff, under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, is entitled to notice\n16\nof a DACA termination hearing and an opportunity to meaningfully respond to the\n17\nnotice of DACA termination before DACA status is revoked.  These are the same\n18\nprocedural due process protections that DACA specifically provides for and which\n19\nwere  afforded  to  Plaintiff.    Accordingly,  Plaintiff  cannot  prevail  on  his  Fifth\n20\nAmendment claims.4\n21\nMotion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction\n22\nThe  Preliminary  Injunction  entered  on  September  29,  2017:  (1)  vacated\n23\nDefendants’  initial  DACA  revocation;  (2)  reinstated  Plaintiff’s  employment\n24\nauthorization; (3) instructed Defendants to comply with the DACA SOP, in the event\n25\n26\n4 The court does not accept Plaintiff’s contention that procedural due process\n27 requires something akin to a formal judicial proceeding wherein Plaintiff has the\nopportunity  to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  The court also notes\n28 Plaintiff may seek judicial review of his claims by filing a petition for review pursuant\nto 8 U.S.C. §1252.\n- 16 -\n17CV1840\n\nCase 3:17-cv-01840-JM-NLS   Document 55   Filed 04/12/18   PageID.1398   Page 17 of 17\n1\nDefendants  were  to  elect  to  revoke  Plaintiff’s  DACA  status;  and  (4)  ordered\n2\nDefendants to accept Plaintiff’s DACA renewal application.  For the above stated\n3\nreasons, Defendants fully complied with the injunction, including the manner in which\n4\nthey revoked Plaintiff’s DACA status a second time.  Accordingly, the court grants the\n5\nmotion to dissolve the September 29, 2017 preliminary injunction.\n6\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction\n7\nIn light of the court’s conclusion that Defendants did not violate the APA by\n8\nrevoking Plaintiff’s DACA status a second time, Plaintiff fails to make the requisite\n9\nshowing of a likelihood of success on the merits.  Accordingly, the court denies\n10\nPlaintiff’s motion for a preliminarily injunction.\n11\nMotion to Dismiss\n12\nDefendants move to dismiss all four claims alleged in the FAC.  The first two\n13\nclaims for violation of APA arise from the May 2016 and December 2017 revocations\n14\nof Plaintiff’s DACA status, respectively.  As Plaintiff has received a remedy for the\n15\nMay  2016  violation  of  the  DACA  SOP,  this  claim  is  now  moot.    Dismissal  is\n16\nappropriate on the second cause of action because the second DACA revocation, for\n17\nthe above stated reasons, did not violate the APA.  The third claim for violation of the\n18\nFifth  Amendment  also  fails  because  Plaintiff  received  the  Notice  of  Intent  to\n19\nTerminate, an opportunity to respond, and an informed Notice of Termination.  For the\n20\nabove stated reasons, nothing more is required by the Fifth Amendment.  The fourth\n21\nclaim for declaratory relief, for the above stated reasons is moot.  Accordingly, the\n22\ncourt grants the motion to dismiss the action with prejudice.\n23\nIn sum, the court denies Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, grants\n24\nDefendants’ motion to dissolve the September 29, 2018 preliminary injunction, and\n25\ngrants Defendants motion to dismiss the FAC without leave to amend.  The Clerk of\n26\nCourt is instructed to close the file.\n27\nDATED:  April 12, 2018\n28\n   Hon. Jeffrey T. Miller\n   United States District Judge\n- 17 -\n17CV1840",
