    "summary": "<p>This suit, brought on September 14, 2017, challenged President Trump's revocation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The plaintiff was the City of San Jose, and it argued that the rescission violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The City sought a declaration that rescinding DACA was unlawful, and an injunction to halt the rescission and any steps to deport DACA recipients.</p>\r\n<p>The background leading up to this case was lengthy. In 2012, the Obama administration created the DACA program via DHS policy statements. The program offered work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children, as long as they met certain criteria. As of 2017, there were an estimated 800,000 DACA recipients. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he was ending the program in March unless Congress acted within the next six months. As the complaint highlighted, the Obama administration made key promises to immigrants: that any information they provided in the application process would not be used for immigration enforcement, and that barring criminal activity or fraud in their DACA applications, DACA recipients would be able to renew their status and keep their benefits.</p>\r\n<p>In the complaint, San Jose noted that over a quarter of DACA recipients lived in California. The complaint emphasized that San Jose, the tenth-largest city in America, \"has always been a place for immigrants[,] with almost 40% of its current population having been born in another country.\" San Jose further noted that the city employed many DACA recipients, and that the federal government's actions would cause San Jose to experience a significant loss of tax revenue and loss of experienced employees. San Jose alleged that DACA rescission violated Fifth Amendment Due Process rights by targeting individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their national origin without lawful justification. It also alleged that defendants had violated the APA by carrying out government action without first going through notice and comment.</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen on Sept. 14, and reassigned to Judge William Alsup on Sept. 21 after the case was related to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regents of the University of California v. Department of Homeland Security</a> (No. 17-cv-05211), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16160/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garcia v. USA</a> (No. 17-cv-5380), and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16144/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of California v. DHS</a> (No. 17-cv-5235). The case was later related to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16220/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">County of Santa Clara v. Trump</a> (No. 17-cv-05813).</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 6, in a related challenge led by Regents of University of California before this judge, the government filed the administrative record, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0051-0008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, which included a series of government documents pertaining to DACA from its inception to the decision to rescind it. On Oct. 17, after the University in the related case moved to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record, the court ordered them to do so in all related cases, including this one.</p>\r\n<p>The court ultimately found that the defendants did not produce all documents leading to the rescission, specifically related documents that Acting Secretary Duke did not directly review. The defendants moved to stay further proceedings at this court on Oct. 18 in light of their intent to appeal this ruling to the Ninth Circuit. The court denied staying proceedings on Oct. 19, and the defendants appealed the next day by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus and an emergency motion for stay. On Oct. 23, the district court replied to the Ninth Circuit's invitation to answer the government's petition stating it would not stay proceedings in light of the narrow window of time until the DACA ended on March 5, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On Nov. 16, the Ninth Circuit denied defendants' motion for a writ of mandamus, and the District Court immediately ordered the federal government to file an augmented administrative record by Nov 22. On Nov. 17, the federal government filed an emergency motion noting that it intended to file an application for mandamus with the Supreme Court no later than Nov. 20, and requesting that the Ninth Circuit stay its order pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the forthcoming petition. On Nov. 21, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the federal government's motion, holding that jurisdiction lied with the District Court and instructing the federal government that further relief must be sought in a new petition for mandamus.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the District Court, Judge Alsup on Nov. 20 agreed to stay all discovery until Dec. 22, at which point the augmented administrative record would be due.</p>\r\n<p>On Dec. 1, 2017, the government filed notice that they appealed the Ninth's Circuit denial of mandamus relief and applied for a stay to the Supreme Court. On Dec. 21 in a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's denial and remanded the case. The Court held that the district court should have stayed the order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. The Supreme Court stated that the lower court should have \"first resolved the Government's threshold arguments (that the Acting Secretary's determination to rescind DACA was unreviewable because it was \"committed to agency discretion,\" 5 U. S. C. &sect;701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction). Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative record.\" 583 U.S. ____ (2017). The same day, the district court stayed the order compelling the government to complete the administrative record.</p>\r\n<p>On Jan. 9, 2018, the district court denied the government's Nov. 1, 2017 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and provided provisional relief to the plaintiffs. The order indicated the court would separately deny the government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering that DACA remain in effect on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the rescission. However, the government did not need to process new applications from individuals who never before received deferred action. The court then granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to dismiss on Jan. 12, dismissing the plaintiffs' Regulatory Flexibility Act and equitable estoppel claims as well the individual plaintiffs' declaratory relief claims. The court sustained the plaintiffs' APA, due process, and equal protection claims (with a few exceptions from the various complaints of the related cases).</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit on Jan. 16, 2018, and also sought certiorari from the Supreme Court on Jan. 18 while the Ninth Circuit appeal was pending, arguing that the Supreme Court's immediate review was warranted because of how long the appeal would take in the Ninth Circuit and how time-sensitive the issue was. The Supreme Court denied certiorari without prejudice on Feb. 26, 2018, indicating the assumption of the justices \"that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case.\"</p>\r\n<p>The related cases were consolidated in the Ninth Circuit for the purposes of appeal. UC Regents, et al v. USA, et al, Case Number 18-80037 USCA 9th Circuit March 19, 2018. In February and March 2018, the parties and amici filed their briefs, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit (Judges Kim McLane Wardlaw, Jacqueline H. Nguyen, and John B. Owens) affirmed the district court's rulings on Nov. 8, 2018. The panel held that \"DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion\" and the government's belief that DACA was illegal was wrong. 2018 WL 5833232. Thus, the panel concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits in showing that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The panel also held that a nationwide injunction was appropriate because it \"promotes uniformity in immigration enforcement, and is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress.\" Id.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari on Nov. 5, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in three DACA cases: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/15462/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16162/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NAACP v. Trump</a>, all of which were pending before different circuit courts of appeal. The Court consolidated the three cases (No. 18-587).</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS&rsquo;s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA, that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program, and that the rescission was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious in violation fo the APA. 591 U.S. 1.</p>\r\n<p>Following the Supreme Court's decision, in another case challenging the DACA recession, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16202/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>, the Fourth Circuit issued a mandate to reinstate DACA and set aside the recession memo on a nationwide basis on June 30, 2020. On July 17, 2020, the District Court of Maryland ordered DHS to reinstate DACA as it existed before the issuance of the recession memo and ordered DHS to resume accepting initial DACA applications.</p>\r\n<p>However, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf instead issued a memorandum entitled \"Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled 'Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" on July 28, 2020 (\"Wolf Memorandum\"). In this memo, Acting Secretary Wolf stated that he would reconsider DACA's future in light of the Supreme Court's decision. In the interim, the memo instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. Later in August, Deputy Director for Policy for USCIS Joseph Edlow issued a memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum.</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 3, 2020. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs substituted some of the defendants to reflect new individuals occupying the relevant roles and to add additional responsible officials, including Deputy Director for Policy Edlow. The amended complaint argued that Acting Secretary Wolf's actions were invalid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Action, Homeland Security Act, and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because he lacked proper authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum violated the APA because Wolf and Edlow acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the defendants from altering or limiting DACA program and vacating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda.</p>\r\n<p>Before any additional activity on the amended complaint in this case, on December 4, the court in another case challenging the Wolf Memorandum,<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/15462/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/case/16130/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of New York v. Trump</a>, ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017 after it found that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary. The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years. On December 7, 2020 <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USCIS</a> updated their website and indicated that effective that day, USCIS would accept initial applications, extend one-year DACA renewals to two-years, and accept applications for advance parole.</p>\r\n<p>Then, in early 2021, President Biden took office. On the day of his inauguration (January 20, 2021), President Biden signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General &ldquo;to preserve and fortify DACA.&rdquo; In light of potential additional agency action to implement the memorandum, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay further proceedings and vacate pending deadlines on March 22, 2021. They agreed to provide the court with status updates every 60 days. The first is due May 24, 2021. This case is ongoing.</p>",

Begun in 2012,\nDACA provided deferred action for certain individuals without lawful immigration\nstatus who had entered the United States as children.  Several sets of plaintiffs sued\nto enjoin the rescission of DACA under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)\nand under various constitutional theories not relevant here.\nThe merits of those claims are not before us today.  The only issue is a\nprocedural one, raised by the government’s petition for a writ of mandamus.  The\n2\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 3 of 18\ngovernment asks us to permanently stay the district court’s order of October 17,\n2017, which required it to complete the administrative record.1  See Order re\nMotion to Complete Administrative Record, Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Homeland Sec., No. C 17-05211 WHA, 2017 WL 4642324 (October 17,\n2017) (“Order”).  We have jurisdiction pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n1651.  Because the district court did not clearly err by ordering the completion of\nthe administrative record, we hold that the government has not met the high bar\nrequired for mandamus relief.\nOne note at the outset:  We are not unmindful of the separation-of-powers\nconcerns raised by the government.  However, the narrow question presented here\nsimply does not implicate those concerns.  We consider only whether DHS failed\nto comply with its obligation under the APA to provide a complete administrative\nrecord to the court—or, more precisely, whether the district court clearly erred in\nso holding.  See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402,\n420 (1971) (“[R]eview is to be based on the full administrative record that was\nbefore the Secretary at the time he made his decision.”).  This obligation is\n1 Issues regarding supplementation—as opposed to completion—of the\nrecord and the propriety of discovery on the non-APA claims, including the\npropriety of depositions, are not properly before us at this time, and we do not\naddress them here.\n3\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 4 of 18\nimposed to ensure that agency action does not become effectively unreviewable,\nfor “[i]f the record is not complete, then the requirement that the agency decision\nbe supported by ‘the record’ becomes almost meaningless.”   Portland Audubon\nSoc’y v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d 1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993). \nAssuring that DHS complies with this requirement—imposed by the APA on all\nagencies and embodied in decades of precedent—is undoubtedly a proper judicial\nfunction. \n1. “The writ of mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved\nonly for really extraordinary cases.”  In re Van Dusen, 654 F.3d 838, 840 (9th Cir.\n2011) (quoting Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259–60 (1947) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).  Indeed, “only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial\nusurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion will justify the invocation of this\nextraordinary remedy.”  Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Ultimately, the issuance of the\nwrit is “in large measure . . . a matter of the court’s discretion.”  Johnson v.\nConsumerinfo.com, Inc., 745 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting United\nStates v. Sherman, 581 F.2d 1358, 1361 (9th Cir. 1978)).\nOur discretion is guided by the five factors laid out in Bauman v. U.S.\nDistrict Court, 557 F.2d 650 (9th Cir. 1977).  However, we need not consider four\n4\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 5 of 18\nof those five factors here, because “the absence of factor three—clear error as a\nmatter of law—will always defeat a petition for mandamus.”  In re Bundy, 840\nF.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting In re United States, 791 F.3d 945, 955\n(9th Cir. 2015)).  This factor—whether “[t]he district court’s order is clearly\nerroneous as a matter of law,” Bauman, 557 F.2d at 654–55—“is significantly\ndeferential and is not met unless the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.”  In re Bundy, 840 F.3d at 1041\n(quoting In re United States, 791 F.3d at 955).\n2. The district court’s order is not clearly erroneous as a matter of law. \nAPA § 706 provides that arbitrary and capricious review shall be based upon “the\nwhole record or those parts of it cited by a party.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  The whole\nrecord “includes everything that was before the agency pertaining to the merits of\nits decision.”  Portland Audubon, 984 F.2d at 1548; see also, e.g., James Madison\nLtd. by Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“The administrative\nrecord includes all materials compiled by the agency that were before the agency at\nthe time the decision was made.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nMore specifically, we have explained that the whole administrative record\n“consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by\nagency decision-makers and includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.” \n5\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 6 of 18\nThompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 739\n(10th Cir. 1993) (same).  The record is thus not necessarily limited to “those\ndocuments that the agency has compiled and submitted as ‘the’ administrative\nrecord.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAt the initial case management conference before the district court, the\ngovernment agreed to produce the complete administrative record on October 6,\n2017.  On that date, the government submitted as “the” administrative record\nfourteen documents comprising a mere 256 pages, all of which are publicly\navailable on the internet.  Indeed, all of the documents in the government’s\nproffered record had previously been included in filings in the district court in this\ncase, and 192 of its 256 pages consist of the Supreme Court, Fifth Circuit, and\ndistrict court opinions in the Texas v. United States litigation.2\nFaced with this sparse record, and on the plaintiffs’ motion (opposed by the\ngovernment), the district court ordered the government to complete the record to\ninclude, among other things, all DACA-related materials considered by\n2 That lawsuit challenged a related but distinct deferred action policy,\nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or\nDAPA.  See United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); Texas v. United States,\n809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015); Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D.\nTex. 2015).\n6\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 7 of 18\nsubordinates or other government personnel who then provided written or verbal\ninput directly to Acting Secretary Duke.  The district court excluded from the\nrecord documents that it determined in camera are protected by privilege.  Order at\n*8.\n3. The administrative record submitted by the government is entitled to a\npresumption of completeness which may be rebutted by clear evidence to the\ncontrary.  Bar MK Ranches, 994 F.2d at 740; see also Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555\n(noting that the administrative record “is not necessarily those documents that the\nagency has compiled and submitted as ‘the’ administrative record.”).  The district\ncourt correctly stated this legal framework and concluded that the presumption of\ncompleteness had been rebutted here.  Order at *5.  This conclusion was not clear\nlegal error:  Put bluntly, the notion that the head of a United States agency would\ndecide to terminate a program giving legal protections to roughly 800,000 people3\n3 See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Number of Form I-821D,\nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, by Fiscal Year, Quarter,\nIntake, Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year 2012–2017 (June 30) (Sept. 20,\n2017), goo.gl/UcGJww. \n7\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 8 of 18\nbased solely on 256 pages of publicly available documents is not credible, as the\ndistrict court concluded.4\nThe district court identified several specific categories of materials that were\nlikely considered by the Acting Secretary or those advising her, but which were not\nincluded in the government’s proffered record.  For example, the record contains\nno materials from the Department of Justice or the White House—other than a one-\npage letter from Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions—despite evidence that\nboth bodies were involved in the decision to end DACA, including the President’s\nown press release taking credit for the decision.5  Nor does the proffered record\ninclude any documents from Acting Secretary Duke’s subordinates; we agree with\nthe district court that “it strains credulity” to suggest that the Acting Secretary\ndecided to terminate DACA “without consulting one advisor or subordinate within\nDHS.”  Order at *4.  And the proffered record contains no materials addressing the\nchange of position between February 2017—when then-Secretary John Kelly\naffirmatively decided not to end DACA—and Acting Secretary Duke’s September\n4 The dissent agrees that “a policy shift of that magnitude presumably would\nnot have been made without extensive study and analysis beforehand.”  Dissent at\n1.\n5 See Press Release, White House Office of the Press Secretary, President\nDonald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to Immigration\n(Sept. 5, 2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/05/\npresident-donald-j-trump-restores-responsibility-and-rule-law.\n8\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 9 of 18\n2017 decision to do the exact opposite, despite the principle that reasoned agency\ndecision-making “ordinarily demand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it\nis changing position” and “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).\nAt oral argument, the government took the position that because the Acting\nSecretary’s stated justification for her decision was litigation risk, materials\nunrelated to litigation risk need not be included in the administrative record. \nSimply put, this is not what the law dictates.  The administrative record consists of\nall materials “considered by agency decision-makers,” Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555\n(emphasis added), not just those which support or form the basis for the agency’s\nultimate decision.  See also, e.g., Amfac Resorts, LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 143\nF. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (“[A] complete administrative record should\ninclude all materials that ‘might have influenced the agency’s decision,’ and not\nmerely those on which the agency relied in its final decision.”) (quoting Bethlehem\nSteel v. EPA, 638 F.2d 994, 1000 (7th Cir. 1980)).  And even if the record were\nproperly limited to materials relating to litigation risk, the district court did not\nclearly err in concluding that it is implausible that the Acting Secretary would\nmake a litigation-risk decision “without having generated any materials analyzing\n9\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 10 of 18\nthe lawsuit or other factors militating in favor of and against the switch in policy.” \nOrder at *4.\nIt was therefore not clear error for the district court to conclude that the\npresumption of regularity that attaches to the government’s proffered record is\nrebutted, and that ordering completion of the record was necessary and appropriate.\n4. Nor did the district court clearly err in identifying the materials that\nshould have been included within the scope of the complete administrative record. \nThe government challenges the decision to include materials considered by\nsubordinates who then briefed the Acting Secretary, but this decision was not clear\nlegal error.  We have held that the record properly includes “all documents and\nmaterials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers,” Thompson,\n885 F.2d at 555, but have not yet clarified the exact scope of “indirectly\nconsidered.”  District courts in this and other circuits, however, have interpreted\nthat phrase to include materials relied on by subordinates who directly advised the\nultimate decision-maker.  See, e.g., Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Gutierrez, No. C\n01-0421 JL, 2008 WL 11358008, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 2008) (“To the extent\n[the government argues] that only those documents that reached [the agency’s]\nmost senior administrators were in fact ‘considered,’ courts have rejected that view\nas contrary to the Ninth and other Circuits’ pronouncements . . . .”);\n10\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 11 of 18\nGeorgiaCarry.org, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 212 F. Supp. 3d 1348, 1352\n(N.D. Ga. 2016) (“Documents and materials indirectly considered by agency\ndecision-makers are those that may not have literally passed before the eyes of the\ndecision-makers, but were so heavily relied on in the recommendation that the\ndecisionmaker constructively considered them.”); Amfac Resorts, 143 F. Supp. 2d\nat 12 (“[I]f the agency decisionmaker based his decision on the work and\nrecommendations of subordinates, those materials should be included as well.”).6\nMoreover, as noted in the district court’s October 17 order, a Department of\nJustice guidance document directs agencies compiling the administrative record to\n“[i]nclude all documents and materials prepared, reviewed, or received by agency\npersonnel and used by or available to the decision-maker, even though the final\ndecision-maker did not actually review or know about the documents and\nmaterials.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Env’t and Nat. Res. Div., Guidance to Federal\nAgencies on Compiling the Administrative Record 3 (Jan. 1999) (emphasis added). \nIt further provides that the administrative record should include “communications\n6 We also note that the government has conceded in other cases that\ndocuments relied on by subordinates are properly part of the administrative record. \nSee Oceana, Inc. v. Pritzker, No. 16-cv-06784-LHK (SVK), 2017 WL 2670733, at\n*4 (N.D. Cal. June 21, 2017) (“Defendants acknowledge . . . that a decision-maker\ncan be deemed to have ‘constructively considered’ materials that, for example,\nwere relied on by subordinates . . . .”).\n11\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 12 of 18\nthe agency received from other agencies . . . documents and materials that support\nor oppose the challenged agency decision . . . minutes of meetings or transcripts\nthereof . . . [and] memorializations of telephone conversations and meetings, such\nas a memorandum or handwritten notes.”  Id. at 3–4.  The district court’s October\n17 order complies with this Department of Justice guidance; the government’s\nproffered record does not.\nWe recognize that such guidance is not binding; we nevertheless find it\npersuasive as a statement by the Department of Justice as to what should be\nincluded in a complete administrative record.  We also note that the guidance\ndocument DHS failed to comply with here was inexplicably rescinded the very\nsame day that the government filed this petition for a writ of mandamus.\nGiven that the district court’s interpretation of Thompson is consistent with\nthe rulings of other district courts, comports with the Department of Justice’s\nguidance on administrative records, and is not foreclosed by Ninth Circuit\nauthority, we cannot say that the district court’s interpretation was clearly\nerroneous as a matter of law.  See In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d 913, 916–17\n(9th Cir. 2016) (“It is well established that ‘[t]he absence of controlling precedent\n12\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 13 of 18\nweighs strongly against a finding of clear error [for mandamus purposes].’”)\n(quoting In re Van Dusen, 654 F.3d at 845).7\n5. The district court’s order that the government complete the record\nwith documents considered by former DHS Secretary John Kelly in the course of\ndeciding not to terminate DACA in February 2017 also withstands mandamus\nscrutiny.  This is not because of some freestanding requirement that all the\nmaterials underlying a previous decision on a similar subject are always part of the\nadministrative record; rather, it simply recognizes that both decisions were part of\nan ongoing decision-making process regarding deferred action:  In February 2017,\nSecretary Kelly ended other prioritization programs, but left DACA and DAPA in\nplace; in June 2017, Secretary Kelly ended DAPA but left DACA intact; finally, in\nSeptember 2017, Acting Secretary Duke ended DACA.  The materials considered\nby Secretary Kelly in the course of deciding against ending DACA in February\n7 There is tension within our decisions about whether controlling Ninth\nCircuit precedent is a necessary precondition to finding clear error as a matter of\nlaw.  Compare In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d at 917 (“If ‘no prior Ninth Circuit\nauthority prohibited the course taken by the district court, its ruling is not clearly\nerroneous.’”) (quoting In re Morgan, 506 F.3d 705, 713 (9th Cir. 2007)), with\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1147, 1159 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he necessary\nclear error factor does not require that the issue be one as to which there is\nestablished precedent.”) (emphasis added).  At a minimum, however, the lack of\nsuch authority “weighs strongly” against finding clear error.  In re Swift Transp.\nCo., 830 F.3d at 916.\n13\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 14 of 18\n2017 did not cease to be “before the agency” for purposes of the administrative\nrecord during that seven-month evolution in policy.  Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n555–56.  The district court’s decision to order their inclusion in the record was\ntherefore not clear legal error.\n6. Finally, the government makes two categorical arguments with respect\nto privilege.8  First, it contends that Cheney v. U.S. District Court, 542 U.S. 367\n(2004), bars the completion of the administrative record with any White House\nmaterials, because requiring White House officials to search for and assert\nprivilege as to individual documents would be an unwarranted intrusion into\nexecutive decision-making.  Cheney, of course, did not involve an administrative\nagency’s obligation under the APA to provide the court with the record underlying\nits decision-making.  It instead involved civil discovery requests that the Supreme\nCourt described variously as “overbroad” and as “ask[ing] for everything under the\nsky.”  Id. at 383, 387.  We do not read Cheney as imposing a categorical bar\nagainst requiring DHS to either include White House documents in a properly-\n8 The government also appears to challenge the district court’s individual\nprivilege determinations, but it has provided little in the way of argument regarding\nthe specific documents ordered disclosed by the district court.  We are unable to\nconclude that the government has met its burden of showing that the district court’s\nprivilege analysis was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\n14\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 15 of 18\ndefined administrative record or assert privilege individually as to those\ndocuments.  \nMoreover, the reasoning of Cheney appears to be based substantially on the\nfact that the Vice President himself was the subject of discovery.  See id. at 381\n(“Here, however, the Vice President and his comembers on the NEPDG are the\nsubjects of the discovery orders.”), 382 (“These separation-of-powers\nconsiderations should inform a court of appeals’ evaluation of a mandamus petition\ninvolving the President or the Vice President.”).  Here, although the government is\nof course correct that the President is named as a defendant in some of the\nunderlying lawsuits, there is no indication that either his documents or those of the\nVice President would fall within the completed administrative record as ordered by\nthe district court.  Cheney therefore does not render the district court’s order clearly\nerroneous. \nSecond, the government argues that it was clear legal error to require a\nprivilege log and to evaluate documents allegedly protected by the deliberative\nprocess privilege on an individual basis, since “deliberative” materials are not\nproperly within the administrative record at all.  As noted above, the district court\nreviewed in camera each of the documents as to which the government asserted the\ndeliberative process privilege, and ordered the inclusion of only those documents\n15\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 16 of 18\nthat met the balancing standard laid out in FTC v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 742\nF.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984).  The court stated that it would similarly review in\ncamera any additional documents as to which the government claims privilege in\nthe future.  Order at *8.\nAs the government acknowledges, we have not previously addressed\nwhether assertedly deliberative documents must be logged and examined or\nwhether the government may exclude them from the administrative record\naltogether.  However, many district courts within this circuit have required a\nprivilege log and in camera analysis of assertedly deliberative materials in APA\ncases.  See, e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15-cv-01590, 2017 WL\n1709318, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2017); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No.\n16-cv-01574 VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017); California ex\nrel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., No. C05-03508 EDL, 2006 WL 708914, at *4\n(N.D. Cal. March 16, 2008).  Again, “the absence of controlling precedent” and the\npractice of the district courts “weigh[] strongly against a finding of clear error” for\npurposes of mandamus.  In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d at 916–17 (citation\nomitted).\nWe further note that the “deliberative” materials at issue in the main case\ncited by the government, San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. Nuclear\n16\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 17 of 18\nRegulatory Comm’n, 789 F.2d 26 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc), were transcripts of\nliteral deliberations among the members of a multi-member agency board.  See id.\nat 44.  Where—as in Mothers for Peace—an agency is headed by a multi-member\nboard, the deliberations among those members are analogous to the internal mental\nprocesses of the sole head of an agency, and thus are generally not within the scope\nof the administrative record.  Cf. Portland Audubon, 984 F.2d at 1549\n(distinguishing Mothers for Peace as involving “the internal deliberative processes\nof the agency [and] the mental processes of individual agency members”)\n(emphases added).  No such deliberations among a multi-member agency are at\nissue here.  The district court’s decision to require a privilege log and evaluate\nclaims of privilege on an individual basis before including documents in the record\nwas not clearly erroneous as a matter of law. \n*     *     *\nThe district court’s October 17, 2017 order represents a reasonable approach\nto managing the conduct and exigencies of this important litigation—exigencies\nwhich were dictated by the government’s March 5, 2018 termination date for\nDACA.  In order for the government to prevail in its request for the extraordinary\nremedy of mandamus, we must be “left with a definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been committed.”  In re Bundy, 840 F.3d at 1041 (quoting In re United\n17\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 18 of 18\nStates, 791 F.3d at 955).  We are left with no such conviction here, and mandamus\nrelief is therefore not appropriate.\nAccordingly, the stay of proceedings entered on October 24, 2017 is lifted.\nPETITION DENIED.\n18\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 1 of 6\nFILED\nIn re United States of America, No. 17-72917\nNOV 16 2017\nWATFORD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nI understand why the district court ordered the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) to provide a more fulsome administrative record.  The agency’s\ndecision to rescind DACA will profoundly disrupt the lives of hundreds of\nthousands of people, and a policy shift of that magnitude presumably would not\nhave been made without extensive study and analysis beforehand.  But the desire\nfor greater insight into how DHS arrived at its decision is not a legitimate basis for\nordering the agency to expand the administrative record, unless the plaintiffs make\na threshold factual showing justifying such action.  They have not done so here. \nAs a result, I think the district court’s order constitutes “a clear abuse of\ndiscretion,” and the burden imposed by the order is exceptional enough to warrant\nthe extraordinary remedy of mandamus.  Cheney v. United States District Court for\nthe District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004).\nThe district court’s order violates two well-settled principles governing\njudicial review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.  The first\nis that a court ordinarily conducts its review “based on the record the agency\npresents to the reviewing court.”  Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S.\n729, 743–44 (1985); see also Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973) (per\ncuriam).  If the record compiled by the agency is inadequate to support the\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 2 of 6\nPage 2 of 6\nchallenged action, the reviewing court will usually be required to vacate the\nagency’s action and remand for additional investigation or explanation.  Florida\nPower, 470 U.S. at 744.  So in most cases the agency bears the risk associated with\nfiling an incomplete record, not the challengers.  \nThe second principle is that documents reflecting an agency’s internal\ndeliberative processes are ordinarily not part of the administrative record.  See In re\nSubpoena Duces Tecum Served on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n156 F.3d 1279, 1279–80 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Kansas State Network, Inc. v. FCC, 720\nF.2d 185, 191 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  An agency generally has no obligation to include\ndocuments that were prepared to assist the decision-maker in arriving at her\ndecision, such as memos or emails containing opinions, recommendations, or\nadvice.  These pre-decisional materials are not deemed part of the administrative\nrecord because they are irrelevant to the reviewing court’s task.  The court’s\nfunction is to assess the lawfulness of the agency’s action based on the reasons\noffered by the agency, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United\nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50\n(1983), not to “probe the mental processes” of agency decision-makers in reaching\ntheir conclusions.  Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18 (1938).  Requiring\nroutine disclosure of deliberative process materials would also chill the frank\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 3 of 6\nPage 3 of 6\ndiscussions and debates that are necessary to craft well-considered policy.  See\nAssembly of the State of California v. Department of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 920\n(9th Cir. 1992); San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission, 789 F.2d 26, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc) (plurality opinion).\nThere are exceptions to these general rules.  First, expansion of the record\nmay be required when the agency fails to make formal findings and thus leaves the\nreviewing court unable to discern the agency’s reasons for taking the action that it\ndid.  See Public Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 793–94 (9th Cir. 1982). \n(This exception doesn’t apply here because the memo issued by the Acting\nSecretary explicitly states her asserted reason for rescinding DACA: concern that\nthe program would be invalidated in threatened litigation.)  Second, the record may\nbe expanded if there is evidence that the agency cherry-picked the materials it\nincluded by omitting factual information undermining the conclusions it reached. \nSee Portland Audubon Society v. Endangered Species Committee, 984 F.2d 1534,\n1548 (9th Cir. 1993).  And third, documents reflecting an agency’s internal\ndeliberations may on occasion be made part of the record, but only if the\nchallengers make “a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior” on the part\nof agency decision-makers.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401\nU.S. 402, 420 (1971), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 4 of 6\nPage 4 of 6\nU.S. 99 (1977); In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 156 F.3d at 1279–80.\nThe plaintiffs have not made the showing necessary to trigger either of the\nlatter two exceptions.  They have not shown any likelihood that factual information\nconsidered by the Acting Secretary and relevant to her decision has been omitted\nfrom the record.  Indeed, it would be implausible to think that any such material\nexists, given the nature of the reason asserted by the Acting Secretary for\nrescinding DACA.  Concern over the program’s vulnerability to legal challenge\nwould rest not on factual information but on the legal analysis of lawyers. \nDocuments analyzing DACA’s potential legal infirmities, prepared to assist the\nActing Secretary in assessing the gravity of the litigation risk involved, fall\nsquarely within the category of deliberative process materials mentioned above. \nThey are presumptively outside the scope of what must be included in the\nadministrative record (and may be privileged in any event).\nNor have the plaintiffs attempted at this stage of the case to show bad faith\nor improper behavior on the part of the Acting Secretary.  To be sure, they assert in\ntheir brief that they suspect her stated reason for rescinding DACA is pretextual. \nBut bare assertions of that sort fall far short of the showing needed to overcome the\npresumption that agency decision-makers have acted for the reasons they’ve given.\nBecause the plaintiffs have failed to establish that any of these exceptions\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 5 of 6\nPage 5 of 6\napply, I don’t think the district court’s order can stand.  The court directed DHS to\ninclude in the administrative record all DACA-related “emails, letters, memoranda,\nnotes, media items, opinions, and other materials” considered by the Acting\nSecretary, and all such materials considered by any other government\nofficial—including officials from the Department of Justice and the White\nHouse—who provided the Acting Secretary with written or verbal input on the\ndecision to rescind DACA.  The court further expanded the record to include “all\ncomments and questions propounded by Acting Secretary Duke to advisors or\nsubordinates or others regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA and\ntheir responses.”\nIn my view, the district court exceeded the scope of its lawful authority to\nexpand the administrative record.  The order sweeps far beyond materials related to\nthe sole reason given for rescinding DACA—its supposed unlawfulness and\nvulnerability to legal challenge.  The order requires the inclusion of all documents\nmentioning DACA-related issues of any sort, and is overbroad for that reason\nalone.  But even if the order had been limited to documents analyzing the risk that\nDACA might be invalidated, those materials are deliberative in character and thus\ncould not be made part of the administrative record absent a showing of bad faith\nor improper behavior.  And to the extent the order will compel the production of\n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/16/2017, ID: 10657551, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 6 of 6\nPage 6 of 6\ncommunications between the Acting Secretary and high-level officials in the White\nHouse—including, potentially, the President himself—the order raises the same\nsensitive separation-of-powers concerns that made mandamus relief appropriate in\nCheney.  See 542 U.S. at 389–90.  \nThese departures from settled principles are enough to establish that the\ndistrict court’s order is “clearly erroneous as a matter of law,” which is the most\nimportant of the factors we consider when deciding whether to grant mandamus\nrelief.  In re Bundy, 840 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2016).  The other factors weigh\nin favor of granting relief as well.  The order isn’t immediately appealable, and if\nrelief is denied the harm inflicted will be immediate and irreparable.  As the\ndeclarations submitted by the government attest, the search for documents\nresponsive to the court’s order will be burdensome and intrusive, given the large\nnumber of government officials who may have provided written or verbal input to\nthe Acting Secretary.  And the damage caused by public disclosure of otherwise\nprivileged materials can’t be undone following an appeal from the final judgment.\nThis strikes me as a classic case in which mandamus relief is warranted, and\nI would therefore grant the writ.",

Detroit Timber & Lumber  Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus  \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY  ET AL. v. \nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY  OF  \nCALIFORNIA ET AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 18–587.  Argued November 12, 2019—Decided June 18, 2020*  \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo-\nrandum announcing an immigration relief program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows certain unauthor-\nized aliens who arrived in the United States as children to apply for a \ntwo-year forbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief become \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  Some  \n700,000 aliens have availed themselves of this opportunity. \n     Two years later, DHS expanded DACA eligibility and created a re-\nlated program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).  If implemented, that program \nwould have made 4.3 million parents of U.  S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents eligible for the same forbearance from removal, work  \neligibility, and other benefits as DACA recipients.  Texas, joined by 25 \nother States, secured a nationwide preliminary injunction barring im-\nplementation of both the DACA expansion and DAPA.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit upheld the injunction, concluding that the program violated the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), which carefully defines eligi-\nbility for benefits.  This Court affirmed by an equally divided vote, and \n—————— \n*Together  with No. 18–588, Trump, President of the United States, et  \n \nal. v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et al., \non certiorari before judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for  \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and No. 18–589, Wolf, Acting Secretary \nof Homeland  Security, et al. v.  Batalla  Vidal et al., on certiorari before \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nthe litigation then continued in the District Court.   \n     In June 2017, following a change in Presidential administrations,  \nDHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum, citing, among other reasons, \nthe ongoing suit by Texas  and new policy priorities.  That September, \nthe Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nElaine C. Duke that DACA shared DAPA’s legal flaws and should also \nbe rescinded.  The next day, Duke acted on that advice.  Taking into \nconsideration the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court rulings and the At-\ntorney General’s letter, Duke decided to terminate the program.  She \nexplained that DHS would no longer accept new applications, but that \nexisting DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within six \nmonths could apply for a two-year renewal.  For all other DACA recip-\nients, previously issued grants of relief would expire on their own \nterms, with no prospect for renewal.   \n     Several groups of plaintiffs challenged Duke’s decision to rescind  \nDACA, claiming that it was arbitrary  and capricious in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and infringed the equal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  District  \nCourts in California (Regents, No. 18–587), New York (Batalla Vidal, \nNo. 18–589), and the District of Columbia (NAACP, No. 18–588) all  \nruled for the plaintiffs.  Each court rejected the Government’s argu-\nments that the claims were unreviewable under the APA and that the  \nINA deprived the courts of jurisdiction. In Regents and Batalla Vidal, \nthe District Courts further held that the equal protection claims were \nadequately alleged, and they entered coextensive nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs were likely \nto succeed on their APA claims.  The District Court in  NAACP took a \ndifferent approach.  It deferred ruling on  the equal protection chal-\nlenge but granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their \nAPA claim, finding that the rescission was inadequately explained.  \nThe court then stayed its order for 90 days to permit DHS to reissue a \nmemorandum rescinding  DACA, this time with a fuller explanation of \nthe conclusion that DACA was unlawful.  Two months later, Duke’s  \nsuccessor, Secretary Kirstjen M.  Nielsen, responded to  the court’s  or-\nder.  She declined to disturb or replace Duke’s rescission decision and \ninstead explained why she thought her predecessor’s decision was \nsound.  In addition to reiterating the illegality conclusion, she offered \nseveral new justifications for the rescission.  The Government moved  \nfor the District Court to reconsider in light of this additional explana-\ntion, but the court concluded that the new reasoning failed to elaborate \nmeaningfully on the illegality rationale.  \n     The Government appealed  the various District Court  decisions to  \nthe Second, Ninth, and D.  C. Circuits, respectively.  While those ap-\npeals were pending, the Government filed three petitions  for certiorari  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nbefore judgment.  Following  the Ninth Circuit affirmance in Regents, \nthis Court granted  certiorari.  \nHeld: The judgment in No. 18–587 is vacated in part and reversed in \npart; the judgment in No. 18–588 is affirmed; the February 13, 2018 \norder in No. 18–589 is vacated, the November 9, 2017 order is affirmed  \nin part, and the March 29, 2018 order is reversed in part; and all of the \ncases are remanded. \nNo. 18–587, 908 F. 3d 476, vacated in part and reversed in part; No. 18–\n588, affirmed; and No. 18–589, February  13, 2018 order vacated, No-\nvember 9, 2017 order affirmed in part, and March 29, 2018 order re-\nversed in part; all cases remanded. \n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to  \nPart IV, concluding: \n   1. DHS’s rescission decision  is reviewable under the APA and is \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.  Pp. 9–13. \n     (a) The APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” of agency ac-\ntion, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140, can be rebut-\nted by showing that the “agency action is committed to agency discre-\ntion by law,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  In Heckler v. Chaney, the Court held  \nthat this narrow exception includes an agency’s decision not to insti-\ntute an enforcement action.  470 U. S. 821, 831–832.  The Government  \ncontends that DACA is a general non-enforcement policy  equivalent to \nthe individual non-enforcement decision in  Chaney.  But the DACA  \nMemorandum  did not merely decline to institute enforcement proceed-\nings; it created a program for conferring  affirmative immigration re-\nlief.  Therefore,  unlike  the  non-enforcement  decision  in  Chaney, \nDACA’s creation—and its rescission—is an “action [that] provides a  \nfocus for judicial review.”   Id., at 832.  In addition, by virtue of receiving \ndeferred action, 700,000 DACA recipients may  request work  authori-\nzation and are eligible for Social Security and Medicare.  Access to such  \nbenefits is an interest “courts often are called upon to protect.”  Ibid.   \nDACA’s rescission is thus subject to review under the APA.  Pp. 9–12.\n     (b) The two jurisdictional provisions of the INA invoked by the \nGovernment do not apply.  Title 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), which bars re-\nview of claims arising from “action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to re-\nmove an alien,” is inapplicable where, as here, the parties do not chal-\nlenge any removal proceedings.  And the rescission is not a decision “to  \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders” \nwithin the meaning of §1252(g).  Pp. 12–13. \n   2. DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary  and capricious un-\nder the APA.  Pp. 13–26. \n     (a) In assessing the rescission, the Government urges the Court to \nconsider not just the contemporaneous explanation offered by Acting \nSecretary Duke but also  the additional reasons supplied by Secretary \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nNielsen nine months later.  Judicial review of agency action, however, \nis limited to “the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the \naction.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758.  If those grounds are \ninadequate, a court may  remand for the agency to offer “a fuller expla-\nnation of the agency’s reasoning at the time of the agency  action,” Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.  LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(emphasis added), or to “deal with the problem afresh” by taking  new  \nagency action, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.  S. 194, 201.  Because Sec-\nretary Nielsen chose not to take new action, she was limited to elabo-\nrating on the agency’s original reasons.  But her reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor and consists primarily of imper-\nmissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Citizens to Preserve  Overton Park, \nInc. v.  Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 420.  The rule requiring a new decision  \nbefore considering new reasons is not merely a  formality.  It serves \nimportant administrative law values by  promoting agency accounta-\nbility to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not \nsimply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.  \nEach of these values would be markedly undermined if this Court al-\nlowed DHS to  rely on reasons offered nine months after the rescission \nand after three different courts had identified flaws in the original ex-\nplanation.  Pp. 13–17. \n     (b)  Acting Secretary Duke’s  rescission memorandum failed to con-\nsider important aspects of the problem before the agency.  Although \nDuke was bound by the Attorney General’s determination that DACA \nis illegal, see 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1), deciding  how best to address that \ndetermination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.   \nActing Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority \nin winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope \nof her discretion.  The Attorney General concluded that the legal de-\nfects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.  \nThe Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on \nDAPA’s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it ex-\ntended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens.  But the \ndefining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHS’s decision to defer re-\nmoval, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance \ncomponent from the associated benefits eligibility.  Eliminating bene-\nfits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely \nwithin Duke’s  discretion.  Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in \nher decision, Duke treated the Attorney General’s conclusion regard-\ning the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and \nforbearance, without explanation.  That reasoning repeated the error \nin Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.  \nv. State Farm— treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy \nas sufficient to rescind the entire policy.   463 U. S. 29, 51.  While DHS \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \nwas not required to “consider all policy alternatives,” ibid., deferred \naction was “within the ambit of the existing” policy,  ibid.; indeed, it \nwas the centerpiece of the policy.  In failing to consider the option to \nretain deferred action, Duke “failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned \nanalysis.’ ” Id., at 57. \n \n   That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary  and capri-\ncious, but it was not the only defect.  Duke also failed to address \nwhether there was “legitimate reliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  \nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742.  Certain  \nfeatures of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance \ninterests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first \ninstance. DHS has flexibility in addressing  any reliance interests and \ncould have considered various accommodations.  While the agency was \nnot required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess \nthe existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them \nagainst competing policy concerns.  Its failure to do so was arbitrary  \nand capricious.  Pp. 17–26.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondents’ claims fail \nto establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by \nanimus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Pp. 27–29. \nROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the  Court, except as to Part IV.   \nGINSBURG,  BREYER,  and KAGAN, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and SO-\nTOMAYOR, J., joined as to all but Part IV.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt, except as to Part IV. \n  In the summer of 2012, the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) announced an immigration program known as \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  That \nprogram allows certain unauthorized aliens who entered \nthe United States as children to apply for a two-year for-\nbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief are also \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  \nSome  700,000  aliens  have  availed  themselves  of  this \nopportunity. \n  Five years later, the Attorney General advised DHS to \nrescind DACA, based on his conclusion that it was unlaw-\nful. The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memoran-\ndum terminating the program on that basis.  The termina-\ntion  was  challenged  by  affected  individuals  and  third\nparties who alleged, among other things, that the Acting \nSecretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by failing to adequately address important factors \nbearing on her decision.  For the reasons that follow, we \nconclude that the Acting Secretary did violate the APA, and \nthat the rescission must be vacated.  \nI \nA \n  In June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued \na memorandum announcing an immigration relief program \nfor “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 18–587, p. 97a  \n(App. to Pet. for Cert.).  Known as DACA, the program ap-\nplies to childhood arrivals who were under age 31 in 2012;\nhave continuously resided here since 2007; are current stu-\ndents, have completed high school, or are honorably dis-\ncharged veterans; have not been convicted of any serious \ncrimes; and do not threaten national security or public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsafety.  Id., at 98a.  DHS concluded that individuals who \nmeet these criteria warrant favorable treatment under the \nimmigration laws because they “lacked the intent to violate\nthe law,” are “productive” contributors to our society, and \n“know only this country as home.”  Id., at 98a–99a. \n  “[T]o prevent [these] low priority  individuals from being \nremoved from the United States,” the DACA Memorandum \ninstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “exer-\ncise prosecutorial discretion[] on an individual basis . . . by\n \ndeferring action for a period of two years, subject to re-\nnewal.”  Id., at 100a.  In addition, it directs U. S. Citizen-\nship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to “accept applica-\ntions to determine whether these individuals qualify for \nwork authorization during this period of deferred action,”  \nid., at 101a, as permitted under regulations long predating \nDACA’s creation, see 8  CFR §274a.12(c)(14) (2012) (permit-\nting work authorization for deferred action recipients who \nestablish “economic necessity”); 46 Fed. Reg. 25080–25081 \n(1981) (similar). Pursuant to other regulations, deferred ac-\ntion recipients are considered “lawfully present” for pur-\nposes of, and therefore eligible  to receive, Social Security  \nand Medicare benefits.  See 8 CFR §1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 CFR\n§417.422(h) (2012). \n  In November 2014, two years after DACA was promul-\ngated,  DHS  issued  a  memorandum  announcing  that  it \nwould expand DACA eligibility by removing the age cap, \nshifting the date-of-entry requirement from 2007 to 2010, \nand extending the deferred action and work authorization \nperiod to three years.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a–107a.  In \nthe same memorandum, DHS created a new, related pro-\ngram known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  That program \nwould have authorized deferred action for up to 4.3 million \nparents whose children were U. S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents.  These parents were to enjoy the same for-\nbearance,  work  eligibility,  and  other  benefits  as  DACA \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nrecipients.\n  Before the DAPA Memorandum was implemented, 26 \nStates, led by Texas, filed suit in the Southern District of \nTexas.  The States contended that DAPA and the DACA  \nexpansion violated the APA’s notice and comment require-\nment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the \nExecutive’s duty under the Take Care Clause of the Consti-\ntution. The District Court found that the States were likely \nto succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims and  \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring imple-\nmentation of both DAPA and the DACA expansion.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677–678 (2015). \n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.  Texas v. United  \nStates, 809 F. 3d 134, 188 (2015).  In opposing the injunc-\ntion, the Government argued that the DAPA Memorandum \nreflected an unreviewable exercise of the Government’s en-\nforcement discretion. The Fifth Circuit majority disagreed.  \nIt reasoned that the deferred action described in the DAPA  \nMemorandum was “much more than nonenforcement: It \nwould affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated \nbenefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”   Id., at 166.  \nFrom this, the majority concluded that the creation of the \nDAPA program was not an unreviewable action “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  Id., at 169 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2)).\n  The majority then upheld the injunction on two grounds.  \nIt first concluded the States were likely to succeed on their \nprocedural claim that the DAPA Memorandum was a sub-\nstantive rule that was required to undergo notice and com-\nment.  It then held that the APA required DAPA to be set \naside because the program was “manifestly contrary” to the \nINA, which “expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes” to “receive the benefits” as-\nsociated with “lawful presence” and to qualify for work  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthorization, 809 F. 3d, at 179–181, 186 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Judge King dissented. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote, which meant that no opinion was is-\nsued.  United States v.  Texas, 579 U. S. ___ (2016) (per cu-\nriam).  For the next year, litigation over DAPA and the\nDACA  expansion  continued  in  the  Southern  District  of \nTexas, while implementation of those policies remained \nenjoined. \n  Then, in June 2017, following a change in Presidential \nadministrations, DHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum.  \nIn explaining that decision, DHS cited the preliminary in-\njunction  and  ongoing  litigation  in  Texas,  the  fact  that \nDAPA had never taken effect, and the new administration’s  \nimmigration enforcement priorities.\n  Three  months  later,  in  September  2017,  Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson B. Sessions III sent a letter to Acting Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke, “advis[ing]” \nthat DHS “should rescind” DACA as well.  App. 877.  Citing\nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion and this Court’s equally divided \naffirmance, the Attorney General concluded that DACA \nshared the “same legal . . . defects that the courts recog-\nnized as to DAPA” and was “likely” to meet a similar fate.   \nId., at 878. “In light of the costs and burdens” that a rescis-\nsion would “impose[] on DHS,” the Attorney General urged \n \nDHS  to  “consider  an  orderly  and  efficient  wind-down \nprocess.”  Ibid.  \n  The next day, Duke acted on the Attorney General’s ad-\nvice.  In her decision memorandum, Duke summarized the  \nhistory of the DACA and DAPA  programs, the Fifth Circuit \nopinion and ensuing affirmance, and the contents of the At-\ntorney General’s letter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–117a.  \n“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the \nFifth Circuit’s rulings” and the “letter from the Attorney \nGeneral,” she concluded that the “DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Id., at 117a. \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Duke then detailed how the program would be wound \ndown: No new applications would be accepted, but DHS\nwould entertain applications for two-year renewals from \nDACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within \nsix months.  For all other DACA recipients, previously is-\nsued  grants  of  deferred  action  and  work  authorization  \nwould not be revoked but would expire on their own terms, \nwith no prospect for renewal.  Id., at 117a–118a. \nB \n  Within days of Acting Secretary  Duke’s rescission an-\nnouncement, multiple groups of plaintiffs ranging from in-\ndividual DACA recipients and States to the Regents of the \nUniversity of California and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People challenged her decision \nin the U. S. District Courts for the Northern District of Cal-\nifornia (Regents, No. 18–587), the Eastern District of New \nYork (Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589), and the District of Co-\nlumbia (NAACP, No. 18–588).  The relevant claims are that \nthe rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of\nthe APA and that it infringed the equal protection guaran-\ntee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.1  \n  All three District Courts ruled for the plaintiffs, albeit at \ndifferent stages of the proceedings.2  In doing so, each court \nrejected the Government’s threshold arguments that the \n—————— \n1Plaintiffs also raised notice and comment claims, which uniformly \n \nfailed below, and assorted due process challenges, some of which sur-\nvived motions to dismiss.  Those claims are not before us. \n2In a related challenge not at issue here, the District Court for the \n \nDistrict of Maryland granted partial summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment.  Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Se-\ncurity, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  After the Government filed petitions \nfor certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that deci-\nsion and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and ca-\npricious. Casa de  Maryland  v.  United States Dept. of Homeland Security, \n924 F. 3d 684 (2019), cert. pending, No. 18–1469.  The Fourth Circuit has  \nsince stayed its mandate.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims were unreviewable under the APA and that the INA \ndeprived the court of jurisdiction.  298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n223–224, 234–235 (DC 2018); 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1029–\n1033 (ND Cal. 2018); 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150, 153–154 \n(EDNY 2017).\nIn Regents and Batalla Vidal, the District Courts held  \nthat the equal protection claims were adequately alleged.  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1315 (ND Cal. 2018); 291 F. Supp. 3d \n260, 279 (EDNY 2018).  Those courts also entered coexten-\nsive nationwide preliminary injunctions, based on the con-\nclusion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the mer-\nits of their claims that the rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious. These injunctions did not require DHS to accept \nnew applications, but did order the agency to allow DACA\nrecipients to “renew their enrollments.”  279 F.  Supp. 3d, at \n1048; see 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437 (EDNY 2018). \nIn  NAACP,  the  D. C.  District  Court  took  a  different  \ncourse.  In  April 2018, it deferred ruling on the equal pro-\ntection challenge but granted partial summary judgment to \nthe plaintiffs on their APA claim, holding that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s “conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in [the agency’s] view of DACA’s lawful-\nness.”  298 F. Supp. 3d, at 243.  The District Court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit DHS to “reissue a memoran-\ndum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller expla-\nnation for the determination that the program lacks statu-\ntory and constitutional authority.”  Id., at 245.  \n  Two months later, Duke’s successor, Secretary Kirstjen \nM. Nielsen, responded via memorandum.  App. to Pet. for\nCert. 120a–126a.  She explained that, “[h]aving considered \nthe Duke memorandum,” she “decline[d] to disturb” the re-\nscission. Id., at 121a.  Secretary Nielsen went on to articu-\nlate her “understanding” of Duke’s memorandum, identify-\ning  three  reasons  why,  in  Nielsen’s  estimation,  “the\ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, \nsound.”  Ibid.  First, she reiterated that, “as the Attorney  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nGeneral concluded, the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  \nId., at 122a. Second, she added that, regardless, the agency\nhad “serious doubts about [DACA’s] legality” and, for law \nenforcement reasons, wanted to avoid “legally questiona-\nble” policies.   Id., at 123a.  Third, she identified multiple \npolicy reasons for rescinding DACA, including (1) the belief \nthat any class-based immigration relief should come from \nCongress,  not  through  executive  non-enforcement;  (2)\nDHS’s preference for exercising prosecutorial discretion on \n“a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and (3) the im-\nportance of “project[ing] a message” that immigration laws \nwould be enforced against all classes and categories of al-\niens.  Id., at 123a–124a.  In her final paragraph, Secretary \nNielsen acknowledged the “asserted reliance interests” in \nDACA’s continuation but concluded that they did not “out-\nweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the\nother reasons” for the rescission discussed in her memoran-\ndum.  Id., at 125a. \n  The Government asked the D. C. District Court to revise  \nits prior order in light of the reasons provided by Secretary \nNielsen, but the court declined.  In the court’s view, the new \nmemorandum, which “fail[ed] to elaborate meaningfully” \non the agency’s illegality rationale, still did not provide an \nadequate explanation for the September 2017 rescission.  \n315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 460, 473–474 (2018). \n  The Government appealed the various District Court de-\ncisions to the Second, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, respec-\ntively.  In November 2018, while those appeals were pend-\ning, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions \nfor certiorari before judgment.  After the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the nationwide injunction in  Regents, see 908 F. 3d  \n476 (2018), but before rulings from the other two Circuits, \nwe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases for ar-\ngument.  588 U. S. ___ (2019).  The issues raised here are  \n(1) whether  the  APA  claims  are  reviewable,  (2)  if  so, \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nwhether the rescission was arbitrary and capricious in vio-\nlation of the APA, and (3) whether the plaintiffs have stated \nan equal protection claim. \nII  \n  The dispute before the Court is not whether DHS may \nrescind DACA.  All parties agree that it may.  The dispute\nis instead primarily about the procedure the agency fol-\nlowed in doing so. \n  The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal\nagencies are accountable to the public and their actions \nsubject to review by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U. S. 788, 796 (1992).  It requires agencies to engage in\n“reasoned decisionmaking,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.  S.  \n743, 750 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), and di-\nrects that agency actions be “set aside” if they are “arbi-\ntrary” or “capricious,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  Under this \n“narrow standard of review, . . . a court is not  to substitute  \nits judgment for that of the agency,”  FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 513 (2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted), but instead to assess only whether the de-\ncision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors \nand whether there has been a clear error of judgment,” Cit-\nizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, \n416 (1971).\n  But before determining whether the rescission was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, we must first address the Govern-\nment’s contentions that DHS’s decision is unreviewable  \nunder the APA and outside this Court’s jurisdiction. \nA \n  The APA establishes  a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview [for] one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-\ntion.’”  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140  \n \n(1967) (quoting §702).  That presumption can be rebutted \nby a showing that the relevant statute “preclude[s]” review,  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n§701(a)(1),  or  that  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to \nagency discretion by law,” §701(a)(2).  The latter exception \nis at issue here. \n  To “honor the presumption of review, we have read the \nexception in §701(a)(2) quite narrowly,” Weyerhaeuser Co. \nv. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 12), confining it to those rare “adminis-\ntrative decision[s] traditionally left to agency discretion,”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 191 (1993).  This limited cat-\negory of unreviewable actions includes an agency’s decision \nnot  to  institute  enforcement  proceedings,  Heckler  v.  \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985), and it is on that ex-\nception that the Government primarily relies. \nIn  Chaney,  several  death-row  inmates  petitioned  the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to take enforcement \naction against two States to prevent their use of certain \ndrugs for lethal injection.  The Court held that the FDA’s \ndenial of that petition was presumptively unreviewable in \nlight of the well-established “tradition” that “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce” is “generally commit-\nted to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id.,  at 831.  We \nidentified a constellation of reasons that underpin this tra-\ndition. To start, a non-enforcement decision “often involves \na  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  \nare  peculiarly  within  [the  agency’s]  expertise,”  such  as \n“whether the particular enforcement action requested best \nfits the agency’s overall policies.”  Ibid.  The decision also  \nmirrors, “to some extent,” a prosecutor’s decision not to in-\ndict, which has “long been regarded as the special province\nof the Executive Branch.”  Id., at 832.  And, as a practical \nmatter, “when an agency refuses to act” there is no action \nto “provide[] a focus for judicial review.”  Ibid. \n \n  The Government contends that a general non-enforcement \npolicy  is  equivalent  to  the  individual  non-enforcement \ndecision at issue in  Chaney.  In each case, the Government  \nargues, the agency must balance factors peculiarly within  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nits expertise, and does so in a manner akin to a criminal \nprosecutor.  Building on that premise, the Government ar-\ngues that the rescission of a non-enforcement policy is no  \ndifferent—for purposes of reviewability—from the adoption \nof that policy.  While the rescission may lead to increased \nenforcement, it does not, by itself, constitute a particular  \nenforcement action.  Applying this logic to the facts here, \nthe Government submits that DACA is a non-enforcement  \npolicy and that its rescission is therefore unreviewable. \n  But we need not test this chain of reasoning because \nDACA is not simply a non-enforcement policy.  For starters, \nthe DACA Memorandum did not merely “refus[e] to insti-\ntute proceedings” against a particular entity or even a par-\nticular class.   Ibid.  Instead, it directed USCIS to “establish  \na clear and efficient process” for identifying individuals who \nmet the enumerated criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  \nBased on this directive, USCIS solicited applications from \neligible aliens, instituted a standardized review process, \nand sent formal notices indicating whether the alien would \nreceive the two-year forbearance.  These proceedings are ef-\nfectively “adjudicat[ions].”  Id., at 117a.  And the result of \nthese adjudications—DHS’s decision to “grant deferred ac-\ntion,” Brief for Petitioners 45—is an “affirmative act of ap-\nproval,” the very opposite of a “refus[al] to act,” Chaney, 470  \nU. S., at 831–832.  In short, the DACA Memorandum does \nnot announce a passive non-enforcement policy; it created \na program for conferring affirmative immigration relief.  \nThe creation of that program—and its rescission—is an “ac-\ntion [that] provides a focus for judicial review.”  Id., at 832. \n  The  benefits  attendant  to  deferred  action  provide \nfurther confirmation that DACA is more than simply a  \nnon-enforcement policy.  As described above, by virtue of \nreceiving deferred action, the 700,000 DACA recipients may \nrequest work authorization and are eligible for Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare.  See supra, at 3.  Unlike an agency’s re-\nfusal to take requested enforcement action, access to these \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \ntypes of benefits is an interest “courts often are called upon \nto protect.”  Chaney, 470 U. S., at 832.  See also Barnhart v.  \nThomas, 540 U. S. 20 (2003) (reviewing eligibility determi-\nnation for Social Security benefits).\n  Because the DACA program  is more than a non-enforce-\nment policy, its rescission is subject to review under the\nAPA.  \nB \n  The Government also invokes two jurisdictional provi-\nsions of the INA as independent bars to review.  Neither \napplies. \n  Section 1252(b)(9) bars review of claims arising from “ac-\ntion[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  66 \nStat. 209, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9).  That tar-\ngeted language is not aimed at this sort of case.  As we have  \nsaid before, §1252(b)(9) “does not present a jurisdictional \nbar” where those bringing suit “are not asking  for review of \nan order of removal,” “the decision . . . to seek removal,” or  \n“the process by which . .  . removability will be determined.”  \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (plu-\nrality opinion) (slip op., at 10–11);  id., at ___ (BREYER, J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 31).  And it is certainly not a bar\nwhere, as here, the parties are not challenging any removal \nproceedings.\n  Section 1252(g) is similarly narrow.  That provision limits \nreview of cases “arising from” decisions “to commence pro-\nceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.”  \n§1252(g). We have previously rejected as “implausible” the \nGovernment’s suggestion that §1252(g) covers “all claims \narising from deportation proceedings” or imposes “a general \njurisdictional  limitation.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 482 (1999).  The re-\nscission, which revokes a deferred action program with as-\nsociated benefits, is not a decision to “commence proceed-\nings,”  much  less  to  “adjudicate”  a  case  or  “execute”  a  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nremoval order. \n  With these preliminary arguments out of the way, we \nproceed to the merits. \nIII  \nA \n  Deciding  whether  agency  action  was  adequately  ex-\nplained  requires,  first,  knowing  where  to  look  for  the \nagency’s explanation. The natural starting point here is the \nexplanation provided by Acting Secretary Duke when she \nannounced the rescission in September 2017. But the Gov-\nernment urges us to go on and consider the June 2018 mem-\norandum submitted by Secretary Nielsen as well.  That  \nmemo was prepared after the D. C. District Court vacated  \nthe Duke rescission and gave DHS an opportunity to “reis-\nsue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing \na fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks statutory and constitutional authority.”  298 F. Supp. \n3d, at 245. According to the Government, the Nielsen Mem-\norandum is properly before us because it was invited by the \nDistrict Court and reflects the views of the Secretary of  \nHomeland Security—the official responsible for immigra-\ntion policy. Respondents disagree, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemorandum, issued nine months after the rescission, im-\npermissibly asserts prudential and policy reasons not relied \nupon by Duke. \n  It is a “foundational principle of administrative law” that \njudicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Michigan, \n576 U. S., at 758.  If those grounds are inadequate, a court \nmay remand for the agency to do one of two things: First, \nthe agency can offer “a fuller explanation of  the agency’s \nreasoning at the time of the agency action.” Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(1990)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Alpharma,  Inc.  v.  \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nLeavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 5–6 (CADC 2006) (Garland, J.) (per-\nmitting an agency to provide an “amplified articulation” of \na prior “conclusory” observation (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  This route has important limitations.  When  an  \nagency’s initial explanation “indicate[s] the determinative \nreason for the final action taken,” the agency may elaborate \nlater on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new \nones. Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam).  \nAlternatively,  the  agency  can  “deal  with  the  problem\nafresh” by taking new agency action.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U. S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II).  An agency taking \nthis route is not limited to its prior reasons but must comply \nwith the procedural requirements for new agency action. \n  The District Court’s remand thus presented DHS with a \nchoice: rest on the Duke Memorandum while elaborating on \nits prior reasoning, or issue a new rescission bolstered by \nnew reasons absent from the Duke Memorandum.  Secre-\ntary Nielsen took the first path. Rather than making a new\ndecision, she “decline[d] to disturb the Duke memoran-\ndum’s rescission” and instead “provide[d] further explana-\ntion” for that action.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.  Indeed,  \nthe Government’s subsequent request for reconsideration \ndescribed the Nielsen Memorandum as “additional expla-\nnation for [Duke’s] decision” and asked the District Court \nto “leave in  place [Duke’s] September 5, 2017 decision to re-\nscind the DACA policy.”  Motion to Revise Order in No. 17– \ncv–1907 etc. (D DC), pp. 2, 19. Contrary to the position of \nthe  Government  before  this  Court,  and  of  JUSTICE  \nKAVANAUGH in dissent, post, at 4 (opinion concurring in \njudgment in part and dissenting in part), the Nielsen Mem-\norandum was by its own terms not a new rule implementing \na new policy.\n  Because Secretary Nielsen chose to elaborate on the rea-\nsons for the initial rescission rather than take new admin-\nistrative action, she was limited to the agency’s original rea-\nsons, and her explanation “must be viewed critically” to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nensure that the rescission is not upheld on the basis of im-\npermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Overton Park, 401 \nU. S., at 420.  But despite purporting to explain the Duke \nMemorandum, Secretary Nielsen’s reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor.  Acting Secretary \nDuke  rested the rescission on the conclusion that DACA is \nunlawful.  Period.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.  By con-\ntrast, Secretary Nielsen’s new memorandum offered three \n“separate and independently sufficient reasons” for the re-\nscission, id., at 122a, only the first of which is the conclusion \nthat DACA is illegal. \n  Her second reason is that DACA is, at minimum, legally \nquestionable and should be terminated to maintain public\nconfidence in the rule of law and avoid burdensome litiga-\ntion.  No such justification can be found in the Duke Mem-\norandum. Legal uncertainty is, of course, related to illegal-\nity.  But the two justifications are meaningfully distinct, \nespecially in this context.  While an agency might, for one \nreason or another, choose to do nothing in the face of uncer-\ntainty, illegality presumably requires remedial action of \nsome sort.  \n  The policy reasons that Secretary Nielsen cites as a third \nbasis for the rescission are also nowhere to be found in the \nDuke Memorandum.  That document makes no mention of \na preference for legislative fixes, the superiority of case-by-\ncase decisionmaking, the importance of sending a message \nof robust enforcement, or any other policy consideration.  \nNor are these points included in the legal analysis from the \nFifth Circuit and the Attorney General.  They can be viewed\nonly as impermissible post hoc rationalizations and thus  \nare not properly before us.\n  The Government, echoed by JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, pro-\ntests that requiring a new decision before considering Niel-\nsen’s new justifications would be “an idle and useless for-\nmality.”  NLRB  v. Wyman-Gordon  Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766, \n \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nn. 6 (1969) (plurality opinion).  See also post,  at 5.  Proce-\ndural requirements can often seem such. But here the rule \nserves important values of administrative law.  Requiring \na new decision before considering new reasons promotes \n“agency accountability,” Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., \n476 U. S. 610, 643 (1986), by ensuring that parties and the \npublic can respond fully and in a timely manner to an \nagency’s exercise of authority.  Considering only contempo-\nraneous explanations for agency action also instills confi-\ndence that the reasons given are not simply “convenient lit-\nigating position[s].”  Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham  \nCorp., 567 U. S. 142, 155 (2012) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Permitting agencies to invoke belated justifica-\ntions, on the other hand, can upset “the orderly functioning \nof the process of review,” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. \n80, 94 (1943), forcing both litigants and courts to chase a\nmoving target.  Each of these values would be markedly un-\ndermined were we to allow DHS to rely on reasons offered \nnine months after Duke announced the rescission and after \nthree different courts had identified flaws in the original \nexplanation.\nJUSTICE  KAVANAUGH  asserts  that  this  “foundational \nprinciple of administrative law,” Michigan, 576 U. S., at \n758, actually limits only what lawyers may argue, not what \nagencies may do. Post, at 5.  While it is true that the Court \nhas often rejected justifications belatedly advanced by ad-\nvocates, we refer to this as a prohibition on post hoc ration-\nalizations, not advocate rationalizations, because the prob-\nlem is the timing, not the speaker.  The functional reasons \nfor  requiring  contemporaneous  explanations  apply  with \nequal force regardless whether post hoc justifications are \nraised in court by those appearing on behalf of the agency\nor by agency officials themselves.  See American Textile  \nMfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 539 (1981) \n(“[T]he post hoc rationalizations of the agency . . . cannot \nserve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”); Overton  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPark, 401 U. S., at 419 (rejecting “litigation affidavits” from \nagency officials as “merely ‘post hoc’ rationalizations”).3  \n  Justice Holmes famously wrote that “[m]en must turn  \nsquare corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock \nIsland, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143  \n(1920).  But it is also true, particularly when so much is at \nstake, that “the Government should turn square corners in \ndealing with the people.”  St. Regis Paper Co. v. United \nStates, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting).  The \nbasic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.  This is not the  \ncase for cutting corners to allow DHS to rely upon reasons \nabsent from its original decision.  \nB \n  We turn, finally, to whether DHS’s decision to rescind \nDACA  was arbitrary and capricious.  As noted earlier, Act-\ning Secretary Duke’s justification for the rescission was suc-\ncinct: “Taking into consideration” the Fifth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that DAPA was unlawful because it conferred benefits \nin violation of the INA, and the Attorney General’s conclu-\nsion that DACA was unlawful for the same reason, she \nconcluded—without elaboration—that the “DACA program \nshould be terminated.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.4  \n—————— \n3  JUSTICE  KAVANAUGH further argues that the contemporaneous expla-\nnation  requirement  applies  only  to  agency  adjudications,  not  rule-\nmakings.  Post,  at 5–6 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part).  But he  cites no  authority limiting this basic principle—\nwhich the Court regularly articulates in the context of rulemakings—to \nadjudications.  The Government does not even raise this unheralded ar-\ngument.  \n4The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke  also focused \n \non litigation risk.  Although the background section of her memo refer-\nences a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge \nDACA, the memo never asserts that the rescission was intended to avert \nlitigation.  And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that the policy \nwas unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or de-\nfended in its current form—it is difficult to see how the risk of litigation  \n \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Respondents maintain that this explanation is deficient \nfor three reasons.  Their first and second arguments work \nin tandem, claiming that the Duke Memorandum does not \nadequately explain the conclusion that DACA is unlawful,  \nand that this conclusion is, in any event, wrong.  While \nthose arguments carried the day in the lower courts, in our \nview they overlook an important constraint on Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s decisionmaking authority—she was bound by\nthe Attorney General’s legal determination. \n  The same statutory provision that establishes the Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security’s authority to administer and en-\nforce immigration laws limits that authority, specifying \nthat, with respect to “all questions of law,” the determina-\ntions of the Attorney General “shall be controlling.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1103(a)(1).  Respondents are aware of this con-\nstraint.  Indeed they emphasized the point in the reviewa-\nbility sections of their briefs.  But in their merits argu-\nments, respondents never addressed whether or how this \nunique statutory provision might affect our review.  They\ndid not discuss whether Duke was required to explain a le-\ngal conclusion that was not hers to make.  Nor  did they dis-\ncuss whether the current suits challenging Duke’s rescis-\nsion decision, which everyone agrees was within her legal \nauthority under the INA, are proper vehicles for attacking \nthe Attorney General’s legal conclusion. \n  Because of these gaps in respondents’ briefing, we do not\nevaluate the claims challenging the explanation and cor-\nrectness of the illegality conclusion.  Instead we focus our \nattention on respondents’ third argument—that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke “failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of\nthe  problem”  before  her.  Motor  Vehicle  Mfrs.

S. ____ (2020)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Whether DACA is illegal is, of course, a legal determina-\ntion, and therefore a question for the Attorney General.  But \ndeciding how best to address a finding of illegality moving \nforward can involve important policy choices, especially \nwhen the finding concerns a program with the breadth of \nDACA.  Those policy choices are for DHS. \n  Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretion-\nary authority in winding down the program.  See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 117a–118a (listing the Acting Secretary’s de-\ncisions on eight transition issues).   Among other things, she \nspecified that those DACA recipients whose benefits were \nset to expire within six months were eligible for two-year \nrenewals.  Ibid. \n  But Duke did not appear to appreciate the full scope of \nher discretion, which picked up where the Attorney Gen-\neral’s legal reasoning left off.  The Attorney General con-\ncluded that “the DACA policy has the same legal . . . defects \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  App. 878.  So, to \nunderstand those defects, we look to the Fifth Circuit, the  \nhighest court to offer a reasoned opinion on the legality \nof DAPA.  That court described the “core” issue before it as \nthe “Secretary’s decision” to grant “eligibility for benefits”—\nincluding  work  authorization,  Social  Security,  and \nMedicare—to unauthorized aliens on “a class-wide basis.”   \nTexas, 809  F. 3d, at 170; see id., at 148, 184. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit’s focus on these benefits was central to every stage of \nits analysis.  See id., at 155 (standing); id., at 163 (zone of\ninterest); id., at 164 (applicability of §1252(g));  id., at 166 \n(reviewability); id., at 176–177 (notice and comment); id., at  \n184 (substantive APA).  And the Court ultimately held that \nDAPA was “manifestly contrary to  the INA” precisely be-\ncause it “would make 4.3 million otherwise removable al-\niens” eligible for work authorization and public benefits.  \nId., at 181–182 (internal quotation marks omitted).5  \n—————— \n5As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social  \n \n \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  But there is more to DAPA (and DACA) than such bene-\nfits.  The defining feature of deferred action is the decision \nto defer removal (and to notify the affected alien of that de-\ncision). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a.  And the Fifth Circuit  \nwas careful to distinguish that forbearance component from \neligibility for benefits. As it explained, the “challenged por-\ntion of DAPA’s deferred-action program” was the decision \nto make DAPA recipients eligible for benefits.  See Texas, \n809 F. 3d, at 168, and n. 108.  The other “[p]art of DAPA,” \nthe court noted, “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at \nleast temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as \nto a class of what he deem[ed] to be low-priority illegal al-\niens.”  Id., at 166.  Borrowing from this Court’s prior de-\nscription of deferred action, the Fifth Circuit observed that \n“the states do not challenge the Secretary’s decision to ‘de-\ncline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or de-\ncline to execute a final order of deportation.’”  Id., at 168 \n \n(quoting Reno, 525 U. S., at 484).  And the Fifth Circuit un-\nderscored that nothing in its decision or the preliminary in-\njunction “requires the Secretary  to remove any alien or to\nalter” the Secretary’s class-based “enforcement priorities.”   \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 166, 169.  In other words, the Secre-\ntary’s forbearance authority was unimpaired. \n  Acting Secretary Duke recognized that the Fifth Circuit’s \nholding addressed the benefits associated with DAPA.  In  \nher memorandum she explained that the Fifth Circuit con-\n—————— \nSecurity and Medicare benefits because they had been designated “law-\nfully present.” Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 168.  Lawful presence is a statutory  \nprerequisite for receipt of  certain benefits.  See id., at 148 (citing 8  \nU. S. C. §1611).  It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexo-\nrably from forbearance.  Thus, while deferred action recipients have been \ndesignated lawfully present for purposes of Social Security and Medicare \neligibility, see 8 CFR §1.3; 42 CFR §417.422(h), agencies can also exclude \nthem from this designation, see 45 CFR §152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that \nDACA recipients are not considered lawfully present for purposes of cov-\nerage under the Affordable Care Act). \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncluded that DAPA “conflicted with the discretion author-\nized by Congress” because the INA “‘flatly does not permit \n \nthe reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully\npresent and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of \nfederal and state benefits, including work authorization.’”  \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 114a (quoting Texas, 809 F. 3d, at  \n184).  Duke did not characterize the opinion as one about \nforbearance. \n  In short, the Attorney General neither addressed the for-\nbearance policy at the heart of DACA nor compelled DHS \nto abandon that policy.  Thus, removing benefits eligibility \nwhile continuing forbearance remained squarely within the \ndiscretion of Acting Secretary Duke, who was responsible \nfor “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement poli-\ncies and priorities.” 116 Stat. 2178, 6 U. S. C. §202(5).  But \nDuke’s memo offers no reason  for terminating forbearance.  \nShe instead treated the Attorney General’s conclusion re-\ngarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both \nbenefits and forbearance, without explanation. \n  That reasoning repeated the error we identified in one of \nour leading modern administrative law cases, Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.  There, the Na-\ntional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) \npromulgated a requirement that motor vehicles produced \nafter 1982 be equipped with one of two passive restraints: \nairbags or automatic seatbelts.  463 U. S., at 37–38, 46.  \nFour years later, before the requirement went into effect, \nNHTSA concluded that automatic seatbelts, the restraint of  \nchoice for most manufacturers, would not provide effective \nprotection.  Based on that premise, NHTSA rescinded the \npassive restraint requirement in full.  Id., at 38. \n  We concluded that the total rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As we explained, NHTSA’s justification sup-\nported only “disallow[ing] compliance by means of ” auto-\n \nmatic seatbelts.  Id., at 47.  It did “not cast doubt” on the  \n \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n“efficacy  of  airbag  technology”  or  upon  “the  need  for  a \npassive restraint standard.”  Ibid.  Given NHTSA’s prior \njudgment that “airbags are an effective and cost-beneficial \nlifesaving  technology,”  we  held  that  “the  mandatory\npassive restraint rule [could] not be abandoned without any \nconsideration whatsoever of an airbags-only requirement.”  \nId., at 51. \n  While the factual setting is different here, the error is the \nsame.  Even if it is illegal for DHS to extend work authori-\nzation and other benefits to DACA recipients, that conclu-\nsion supported only “disallow[ing]” benefits.  Id., at 47.  It \ndid “not cast doubt” on the legality of forbearance or upon \nDHS’s original reasons for extending forbearance to child-\nhood arrivals.  Ibid.  Thus, given DHS’s earlier judgment \nthat  forbearance  is  “especially  justified”  for  “productive  \nyoung  people”  who  were  brought  here  as  children  \nand “know only this country as home,”  App. to Pet. for \nCert. 98a–99a, the DACA Memorandum could not be re-\nscinded in full “without any consideration whatsoever” of a \nforbearance-only policy, State Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.6  \n  The Government acknowledges that “[d]eferred action \ncoupled with the associated benefits are the two legs upon \nwhich the DACA policy stands.”  Reply Brief 21.  It insists, \nhowever, that “DHS was not required to consider whether \nDACA’s illegality could be addressed by separating” the \n—————— \n6The three-page memorandum that established DACA is devoted en-\n \ntirely to forbearance, save for one sentence directing USCIS  to “deter-\nmine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work authorization.”  App. \nto Pet. for Cert. 101a.  The benefits associated with DACA flow from a  \nseparate  regulation.  See  8  CFR  §1.3(a)(4)(vi);  see  also  42  CFR \n§417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR §1.3).  Thus, DHS could have ad-\ndressed the Attorney General’s determination that such benefits were \nimpermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR §1.3 to exclude DACA \nrecipients from those benefits without rescinding the DACA Memoran-\ndum and the  forbearance policy it established.  But Duke’s rescission  \nmemo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo.  Ibid.   According to the Government, “It was not arbi-\ntrary and capricious for DHS to view deferred action and its \ncollateral benefits as importantly linked.”  Ibid.  Perhaps.  \nBut that response misses the point. The fact that there may \nbe a valid reason not to separate deferred action from ben-\nefits does not establish that DHS considered that option or \nthat such consideration was unnecessary. \n  The lead dissent acknowledges that forbearance and ben-\nefits are legally distinct and can be decoupled.  Post, at 21– \n22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J). It contends, however, that \nwe should not “dissect” agency action “piece by piece.”  Post,  \nat 21.  The dissent instead rests on the Attorney General’s\nlegal determination—which considered only benefits—“to \nsupply the ‘reasoned analysis’” to support rescission of both \n \nbenefits and forbearance.  Post, at 22 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U. S., at 42).  But State Farm teaches that when an  \nagency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the “alternative[s]” that are “within the ambit of \nthe existing [policy].”  Id., at 51.  Here forbearance was not \nsimply “within the ambit of the existing [policy],” it was the \ncenterpiece of the policy: DACA, after all, stands for “De-\nferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n111a (emphasis added).  But the rescission memorandum  \ncontains no discussion of forbearance or the option of retain-\ning forbearance without benefits.  Duke “entirely failed to \nconsider [that] important aspect of the problem.”  State \nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43.  \n  That omission alone renders Acting  Secretary Duke’s de-\ncision arbitrary and capricious.  But it is not the only defect.   \nDuke also failed to address whether there was “legitimate \nreliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  Smiley v. Citibank  \n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996).  When  an \nagency changes course, as DHS did here, it must “be cogni-\nzant that longstanding policies may have ‘engendered seri-\nous reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” \n \nEncino Motorcars, LLC  v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) \n \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n(slip op., at 9) (quoting Fox Television, 556 U. S., at 515).  “It \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”   \nId., at 515.  Yet that is what the Duke Memorandum did. \n  For its part, the Government does not contend that Duke \nconsidered potential reliance interests; it counters that she \ndid not need to.  In the Government’s view, shared by the \nlead dissent, DACA recipients have no “legally cognizable \nreliance interests” because the DACA Memorandum stated  \nthat the program “conferred no substantive rights” and pro-\nvided benefits only in two-year increments. Reply Brief 16–\n17; App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a. See also post, at 23–24 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J). But neither the Government nor the lead  \ndissent cites any legal authority establishing that such fea-\ntures automatically preclude reliance interests, and we are \nnot aware of any. These disclaimers are surely pertinent in \nconsidering the strength of any reliance interests, but that\nconsideration must be undertaken by the agency in the first \ninstance, subject to normal APA review.  There was no such  \nconsideration in the Duke Memorandum. \n  Respondents and their amici assert that there was much \nfor DHS to consider.  They stress that, since 2012, DACA\nrecipients have “enrolled in degree programs, embarked on \ncareers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even  \nmarried and had children, all in reliance” on the DACA pro-\ngram.  Brief for Respondent Regents of Univ. of California \net al. in No. 18–587, p.  41 (Brief for Regents).  The conse-\nquences of the rescission, respondents emphasize, would \n“radiate outward” to DACA recipients’ families, including \ntheir 200,000 U. S.-citizen children, to the schools where \nDACA recipients study and teach, and to the employers who\nhave invested time and money in training them. See id., at \n41–42; Brief for Respondent State of New York et al. in No. \n18–589, p. 42 (Brief for New York).  See also Brief for 143 \nBusinesses as Amici Curiae 17 (estimating that hiring and\ntraining replacements would cost employers $6.3 billion).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIn addition, excluding DACA recipients from the lawful la-\nbor force may, they tell us, result in the loss of $215 billion \nin economic activity and an associated $60 billion in federal \ntax revenue over the next ten years.  Brief for Regents 6.  \nMeanwhile, States and local governments could lose $1.25 \nbillion in tax revenue each year.  Ibid.  \n  These are certainly noteworthy concerns, but they are not \nnecessarily dispositive.  To the Government and lead dis-\nsent’s point, DHS could respond that reliance on forbear-\nance and benefits was unjustified in light of the express lim-\nitations in the DACA Memorandum.  Or it might conclude \nthat reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful \nare entitled to no or diminished weight.  And, even if DHS \nultimately concludes that the reliance interests rank as se-\nrious, they are but one factor to consider.  DHS may deter-\nmine, in the particular context before it, that other interests \nand policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests.  Mak-\ning that difficult decision was the agency’s  job, but the \nagency failed to do it.\n  DHS has considerable flexibility in carrying out its re-\nsponsibility.  The wind-down here is a good example of the \nkind of options available.  Acting Secretary Duke author-\nized DHS to process two-year renewals for those DACA re-\ncipients  whose  benefits  were  set  to  expire  within  six \nmonths.  But Duke’s consideration was solely for the pur-\npose of assisting the agency in dealing with “administrative \ncomplexities.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a–118a.  She should \nhave considered whether she had similar flexibility in ad-\ndressing any reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nlead dissent contends that accommodating such interests \nwould be “another exercise of unlawful power,” post, at 23 \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the Government does not make\nthat argument and DHS has already extended benefits for \npurposes other than reliance, following consultation with \nthe Office of the Attorney General.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n116a. \n \n\n26   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Had Duke considered reliance interests, she might, for \nexample, have considered a broader renewal period based\non the need for DACA recipients to reorder their affairs.  Al-\nternatively, Duke might have considered more accommo-\ndating termination dates for recipients caught in the mid-\ndle of a time-bounded commitment, to allow them to, say, \ngraduate from their course of study, complete their military \nservice, or finish a medical treatment regimen.  Or she  \nmight have instructed immigration officials to give salient \nweight to any reliance interests engendered by DACA when \nexercising individualized enforcement discretion.\n  To be clear, DHS was not required to do any of this or to \n“consider all policy alternatives in reaching [its] decision.”  \nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.  Agencies are not compelled to\nexplore “every alternative device and thought conceivable \nby the mind of man.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, \n551 (1978).  But, because DHS was “not writing on a blank \nslate,” post, at 22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), it was re-\nquired to assess whether there were reliance interests, de-\ntermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.\n  The lead dissent sees all the foregoing differently.  In its \nview, DACA is illegal, so any actions under DACA are them-\nselves illegal.  Such actions, it argues, must cease immedi-\nately and the APA should not be construed to impede that \nresult.  See post, at 19–23 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  The dissent is correct that DACA was rescinded because \nof  the  Attorney  General’s  illegality  determination.    See  \nante, at 20.  But nothing about that determination fore-\nclosed or even addressed the options of retaining forbear-\nance or accommodating particular reliance interests.  Act-\ning Secretary Duke should have considered those matters \nbut did not.  That failure was arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  27  \n \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nIV \n  Lastly, we turn to respondents’ claim that the rescis-\nsion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n  The parties dispute the proper framing of this claim.  The  \nGovernment contends that the allegation that the Execu-\ntive, motivated by animus, ended a program that dispropor-\ntionately benefits certain ethnic groups is a selective en-\nforcement claim.  Such a claim, the Government asserts,  \nis barred by our decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee.  See 525 U. S., at 488 (holding \nthat “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitu-\ntional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation”).  Respondents counter that their \nclaim falls outside the scope of that precedent because they \nare not challenging individual enforcement proceedings.  \nWe need not resolve this debate because, even if the claim \nis cognizable, the allegations here are insufficient. \n  To plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible infer-\nence that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a moti-\nvating factor” in the relevant decision.  Arlington Heights v.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, \n266 (1977). Possible evidence includes disparate impact on \na particular group, “[d]epartures from the normal proce-\ndural sequence,” and “contemporary statements by mem-\nbers of the decisionmaking body.”  Id., at 266–268.  Track-\ning  these  factors,  respondents  allege  that  animus  is\nevidenced by (1) the disparate impact of the rescission on \nLatinos from Mexico, who represent 78% of DACA recipi-\nents; (2) the unusual history behind the rescission; and \n(3) pre- and post-election statements by President Trump.  \nBrief for New York 54–55. \n  None of these points, either singly or in concert, estab-\nlishes a plausible equal protection claim.  First, because \nLatinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien\npopulation, one would expect them to make up an outsized \n \n\n28   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nshare of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief  \nprogram. See B. Baker, DHS, Office of Immigration Statis-\ntics,  Population  Estimates,  Illegal  Alien  Population \nResiding in the United States: January 2015, Table 2 (Dec. \n2018),  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\n18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf.  Were this fact suffi-\ncient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable im-\nmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection \ngrounds. \n  Second, there is nothing irregular about the history lead-\ning up to the September 2017 rescission.  The lower courts  \nconcluded that “DACA received reaffirmation by [DHS] as \nrecently as three months before the rescission,” 908 F. 3d, \nat 519 (quoting 298 F. Supp. 3d, at 1315), referring to the \nJune 2017 DAPA rescission memo, which stated that DACA \nwould “remain in effect,” App. 870.  But this reasoning con-\nfuses abstention with reaffirmation.  The DAPA memo did \nnot address the merits of the DACA policy or its legality.  \nThus, when the Attorney General later determined that \nDACA  shared  DAPA’s  legal  defects,  DHS’s  decision  to  \nreevaluate DACA was not a “strange about-face.”  908 F. 3d,  \nat 519.  It was a natural response to a newly identified \nproblem.\n  Finally, the cited statements are unilluminating.  The  \nrelevant actors were most directly Acting Secretary Duke \nand the Attorney General.  As the Batalla Vidal court  \nacknowledged, respondents did not “identif[y] statements\nby [either] that would give rise to an inference of discrimi-\nnatory motive.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 278. Instead, respond-\nents contend that President Trump made critical state-\nments  about  Latinos  that  evince  discriminatory  intent.  \nBut,  even  as  interpreted  by  respondents,  these  state-\nments—remote in time and made in unrelated contexts— \ndo not qualify as “contemporary statements” probative of \nthe decision at issue.  Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 268.   \nThus, like respondents’ other points, the statements fail to \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nraise a plausible inference that the rescission was moti-\nvated by animus. \n*  *  * \n  We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are \nsound policies.  “The wisdom” of those decisions “is none of \nour concern.”  Chenery  II, 332 U. S., at 207.  We address \nonly whether the agency complied with the procedural re-\nquirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its ac-\ntion. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous is-\nsues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything \nto do about the hardship to DACA recipients.  That dual  \nfailure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated \nthe scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a \nreasonable manner.  The appropriate recourse is therefore \nto remand to DHS so that it may consider the problem  \nanew. \n  The judgment in NAACP, No. 18–588, is affirmed.7  The  \njudgment in Regents, No. 18–587, is vacated in part and re-\nversed in part.  And in Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589, the Feb-\nruary 13, 2018 order granting respondents’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction is vacated, the November 9, 2017 or-\nder partially denying the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis affirmed in part, and the March  29, 2018 order partially \ndenying the balance of the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis reversed in part. All three cases are remanded for further  \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n—————— \n7Our affirmance of the  NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it \n \nunnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope of the in-\njunctions issued by the District Courts in  Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \n  The majority rightly holds that the Department of Home-\nland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri-\nvals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any chal-\nlenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  \nI believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing \nrecord and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would \ninstead permit respondents to develop their equal protec-\ntion claims on remand. \n  Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in  a \npreliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at \nthis stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that \nwould “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that \n[a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,  678 (2009).  The three courts to eval-\nuate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared \nthis modest threshold.  908 F. 3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) \n(affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018). \n  I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on re-\nmand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts \nthat plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality \ndisagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either sin-\ngly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection \nclaim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by dis-\ncounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly view-\ning the rest.\n  First, the plurality dismisses the statements that Presi-\ndent Trump made both  before and after he assumed office.  \nThe  Batalla  Vidal  complaints  catalog  then-candidate \nTrump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people \nthat have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, \ndrug dealers, [and] rapists.” 291 F.  Supp. 3d, at 276 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints ad-\n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nditionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement compar-\ning undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for \n“the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling \nand trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 \n(ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nplurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote \nin time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  \nAnte, at 28.  \n  But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered \napproach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements \nas remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Ha-\nwaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements \narise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migra-\ntion from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s cam-\npaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, ac-\ncording to respondents, were an animating force behind the \nrescission of DACA. Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proc-\nlamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred \nentry of individuals from several Muslim-majority coun-\ntries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign state-\nments about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the \nPresident” help to “create the strong perception” that the \nrescission  decision  was  “contaminated  by  impermissible \ndiscriminatory  animus.”  585  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of  \nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides\nrespondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection \nclaims further. \n  Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate im-\npact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering \nthis point in isolation. Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient \nto state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immi-\ngration  policy  could  be  challenged  on  equal  protection\ngrounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be \nviewed in the context of the President’s public statements \non and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nstage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an \nexecutive decision disproportionately harms the same ra-\ncial group that the President branded as less desirable mere \nmonths earlier. \n  Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “spe-\ncific sequence of events leading up to the challenged deci-\nsion.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late  \nas  June  2017,  DHS  insisted  it  remained  committed  to \nDACA, even while rescinding a related program, the De-\nferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Perma-\nnent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months  \nlater,  DHS  terminated  DACA  without,  as  the  plurality \nacknowledges, considering important aspects of the termi-\nnation.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests \nthat something other than questions about the legality of \nDACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it \nraises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the \ndecision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Depart-\nment of Commerce  v.  New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) \n(slip op., at 26).  Only by bypassing context does the plural-\nity conclude otherwise. \n*  *  * \n  The facts in respondents’ complaints create more than a\n“sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  \nIqbal, 556 U. S., at 678.  Whether they ultimately amount \nto actionable discrimination should be determined only af-\nter factual development on remand.  Because the Court  \nprematurely  disposes  of  respondents’  equal  protection \nclaims by overlooking the strength of their complaints, I \njoin all but Part IV of the opinion and do not concur in the \ncorresponding part of the judgment. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Between 2001 and 2011, Congress considered over two \ndozen bills that would have granted lawful status to mil-\nlions of aliens who were illegally brought to this country as \nchildren.  Each of those legislative efforts failed.  In the \nwake of this impasse, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (DHS) under President Barack Obama took matters  \ninto its own hands.  Without any purported delegation of \nauthority from Congress and without undertaking a rule-\nmaking, DHS unilaterally created a program known as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  The three-\npage DACA memorandum made it possible for approxi-\nmately 1.7 million illegal aliens to qualify for temporary \nlawful  presence  and  certain  federal  and  state  benefits.  \nWhen President Donald Trump took office in  2017, his Act-\ning Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through yet an-\nother memorandum, rescinded the DACA memorandum.  \nTo state it plainly, the Trump administration rescinded \nDACA the same way that the Obama administration cre-\nated it: unilaterally, and through a mere memorandum. \n  Today the majority makes the mystifying determination \nthat this rescission of DACA was unlawful.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the majority acts as though it is engaging \nin the routine application of standard principles of admin-\nistrative law. On the contrary, this is anything but a stand-\nard administrative law case. \n  DHS created DACA during the Obama administration \nwithout  any  statutory  authorization  and  without  going \nthrough the requisite rulemaking process.  As a result, the  \nprogram was unlawful from its inception.  The majority \ndoes not even attempt to explain why a court has the au-\nthority to scrutinize an agency’s policy reasons for rescind-\ning an unlawful program under the arbitrary and capri-\ncious microscope. The decision to countermand an unlawful \nagency action is clearly reasonable.  So long as the agency’s \ndetermination of illegality is sound, our review should be at \nan end. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an ef-\nfort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct \ndecision. The Court could have made clear that the solution  \nrespondents seek must come from the Legislative Branch.  \nInstead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS’ initial \noverreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.  In \ndoing so, it has given the green light for future political bat-\ntles to be fought in this Court rather than where they right-\nfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes \nthe Court’s duty to apply the law according to neutral prin-\nciples, and the ripple effects of the majority’s error will be \nfelt throughout our system of self-government. \n  Perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority’s holding \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing ad-\nministrations.  Under the auspices of today’s decision, ad-\nministrations  can  bind  their  successors  by  unlawfully \nadopting  significant  legal  changes  through  Executive \nBranch agency memoranda.  Even if the agency lacked au-\nthority to effectuate the changes, the changes cannot be un-\ndone by the same agency in a successor administration un-\nless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications to \nthe satisfaction of this Court.  In other words, the majority \nerroneously holds that the agency is not only permitted, but \nrequired,  to  continue  administering  unlawful  programs \nthat it inherited from a previous administration. I respect-\nfully dissent in part.1  \nI \nA \n  In 2012, after more than two dozen attempts by Congress \nto grant lawful status to aliens who were brought to this \ncountry as children,2 the then-Secretary of Homeland Secu-\nrity Janet Napolitano announced, by memorandum, a new \n—————— \n1I concur in the judgment insofar as the majority rejects respondents’  \n \nequal protection claim. \n2See Immigrant Children’s  Educational Advancement and Dropout \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

In the \nSecretary’s view, the program was consistent with “the \nframework  of the existing law.”  Id., at 101a. \n  DACA granted a renewable 2-year period of “deferred ac-\ntion” that made approximately 1.7 million otherwise remov-\nable aliens eligible to remain in this country temporarily.3   \nBy granting deferred action, the memorandum also made \nrecipients eligible for certain state and federal benefits, in-\ncluding  Medicare  and  Social  Security.

Despite  these \nchanges, the memorandum contradictorily claimed that it \n“confer[red] no substantive right [or] immigration status,” \nbecause “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 18–587, at 101a. \n  In 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh John-\nson broadened the deferred-action program in yet another \nbrief memorandum.  This 2014 memorandum expanded\nDACA eligibility by extending the deferred-action period to \nthree years and by relaxing other criteria.  It also imple-\nmented a related program, known as Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  DAPA allowed unlawfully present parents to ob-\ntain deferred action derivatively through their children who \nwere either citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Ap-\nproximately 4.3 million aliens qualified for DAPA and, as \nwith DACA, these individuals would have become eligible \nfor certain federal and state benefits upon the approval of \ntheir DAPA applications.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF. 3d 134, 181 (CA5 2015).  Nevertheless, the 2014 memo-\nrandum repeated the incongruous assertion that these pro-\ngrams “d[id] not confer any form of legal status in this coun-\ntry” and added that deferred action “may be terminated at \nany time at the agency’s discretion.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. \nin No. 18–587, at 104a. \nB \n  Twenty-six States filed suit to enjoin the implementation \nof  these  new  programs,  DAPA  and  “expanded  DACA,” \nmaintaining that they violated the Constitution, the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA).  The States contended that, \nbecause the 2014 memorandum allowed aliens to receive \ndeferred action and other benefits, it amounted to a legisla-\ntive rule that had to comply with the APA’s notice  and \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The States also argued that DHS’ de-\ncision to recategorize an entire class of aliens from “unlaw-\nfully present” to “lawfully present” exceeded its statutory \nauthority under the federal immigration laws.  According \nto the States, these defects rendered the 2014 memoran-\ndum arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.  \n  The District Court preliminarily enjoined DAPA and ex-\npanded DACA.  The Fifth Circuit  affirmed, rejecting DHS’ \nclaim that the programs were an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion.  Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 167, 188.  The court con-\ncluded that the States were likely to succeed on their claim \nthat the 2014 memorandum was a legislative rule that had \nto be adopted through notice and comment rulemaking.  Id., \nat 171–178.  The court further concluded that the 2014  \nmemorandum was “substantively contrary to law” because\nthe INA did not grant DHS the statutory authority to im-\nplement either program.  Id., at 170, 178–186. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 579 U. S. ___ \n(2016) (per curiam).  \nC \n  The 2014 memorandum was rescinded on June 15, 2017, \nbefore taking effect.  Shortly after that rescission, several \nof the plaintiff States sent a letter to then-Attorney General \nJefferson Sessions III. They contended that the 2012 DACA \nmemorandum was also legally defective because, “just like \nDAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for . . . lawful \npresence without any statutory authorization from Con-\ngress.” App. 873.  The States wrote that they would amend \ntheir complaint to challenge DACA if the administration \ndid not rescind the 2012 memorandum creating DACA by \nSeptember 5, 2017.\n  On September 4, then-Attorney General Sessions wrote \nto  then-Acting  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Elaine  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

Sessions stated that, \nin his legal opinion, DACA took effect “through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no es-\ntablished end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a simi-\nlar result.  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigra-\ntion laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by \nthe Executive Branch.”  Id., at 877.  The letter also stated \nthat DACA was infected with the “same legal . . . defects  \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA,” id., at  878, and thus \nDACA would likely be enjoined as well. \n  Then-Acting Secretary Duke  rescinded DACA the next \nday, also through a memorandum.  Her memorandum be-\ngan by noting that DACA “purported to use deferred action \n. . . to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress \nhad not otherwise acted to provide by law.” App. to Pet. for  \nCert. in No. 18–587, at 112a.  It described the history of the\nFifth Circuit litigation, noting that the court had concluded \nthat DAPA “conflicted with the discretion authorized by  \nCongress”  because  “the [INA] flatly does not permit the  \nreclassification  of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully pre-\nsent.”  Id., at 114a (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fi-\nnally, the memorandum accepted then-Attorney General \nSessions’ legal determination that DACA was unlawful for \nthe same reasons as DAPA.  See §1103(a)(1). In light of the\nlegal conclusions reached by the Fifth Circuit and the At-\ntorney General, then-Acting Secretary Duke set forth the \nprocedures for winding down DACA. \n  These three cases soon followed.  In each, respondents\nclaimed, among other things, that DACA’s rescission was \narbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  APA.    Two  District  \nCourts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while \nthe third vacated the rescission. \nII \n  “‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 290, 317 (2013) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quot-\ning Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355,  \n374 (1986)).  When an  agency exercises power beyond the\nbounds of its authority, it acts unlawfully.  See, e.g., SAS  \nInstitute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___, ___, n. (2018) (slip op., \nat 11, n.).  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA provides \na poignant illustration of ultra vires agency action.\n  DACA alters how the immigration laws apply to a certain \nclass of aliens.  “DACA [recipients] primarily entered the \ncountry either by overstaying a visa or by entering without \ninspection, and the INA instructs that aliens in both classes \nare removable.”  Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662, 713 (SD Tex. 2018) (footnote omitted).  But DACA \ngranted its recipients deferred action, i.e., a decision to “de-\ncline  to  institute  [removal]  proceedings,  terminate  [re-\nmoval] proceedings, or decline to institute a final order of \n[removal].”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  \nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Under other regulations, recipients of deferred \naction are deemed lawfully present for purposes of certain \nfederal benefits. See supra, at 4. Thus, DACA in effect cre-\nated a new exception to the statutory provisions governing \nremovability and, in the process, conferred lawful presence \non an entire class of aliens.  \n  To  lawfully  implement  such  changes,  DHS  needed  a \ngrant of authority from Congress to either reclassify remov-\nable DACA recipients as lawfully present, or to exempt the \nentire class of aliens covered by DACA from statutory re-\nmoval procedures. No party disputes that the immigration \nstatutes lack an express delegation to accomplish either re-\nsult.  And, an examination of the highly reticulated immi-\ngration regime makes clear that DHS has no implicit dis-\ncretion to create new classes of lawful presence or to grant \nrelief from  removal out of whole cloth.  Accordingly, DACA  \nis substantively unlawful. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  This conclusion should begin and  end our review.  The  \ndecision to rescind an unlawful agency action is per se law-\nful. No additional policy justifications or considerations are  \nnecessary.  And, the majority’s contrary holding—that an \nagency is not only permitted, but required, to continue an  \nultra vires action—has no basis in  law. \nA \n  Congress has not authorized DHS to reclassify an entire \nclass of removable aliens as lawfully present or to categori-\ncally exempt aliens from statutory removal provisions.  \n1 \n  I begin with lawful presence.  As just stated, nothing in \nthe federal immigration laws expressly delegates to DHS\nthe unfettered discretion to create new categories of law-\nfully present aliens.  And, there is no basis for concluding \nthat Congress implicitly delegated to DHS the power to re-\nclassify categories of aliens as lawfully present.  The immi-\ngration statutes provide numerous ways to obtain lawful \npresence, both temporary and permanent.  The highly de-\ntailed nature of these provisions indicates that Congress \nhas exhaustively provided for all of  the ways that it thought \nlawful presence should be obtainable, leaving no discretion \nto DHS to add new pathways. \n  For example, federal immigration laws provide over 60\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa options, including visas for \nambassadors, full-time students and their spouses and chil-\ndren, those engaged to marry a United States citizen within \n90 days of arrival, athletes and performers, and aliens with \nspecialized  knowledge  related  to  their  employers.    See  \n§§1101(a)(15)(A)–(V), 1184; 8 CFR §214.1; see also Congres-\nsional Research Service, J. Wilson, Nonimmigrant and Im-\nmigrant Visa Categories: Data Brief 1–6 (2019) (Table 1).  \nIn addition, the statutes permit the Attorney General to \ngrant temporary “parole” into the  United States “for urgent \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

Refugees and asylees also may \nreceive lawful permanent residence under certain condi-\ntions, §1159; 8 CFR §§209.1, 209.2.4  As with  temporary  \nlawful presence,  each  avenue to lawful  permanent resi-\ndence status has its own set of rules and exceptions.5  \n  As the Fifth Circuit held in the DAPA litigation, a conclu-\nsion with which then-Attorney General Sessions agreed, \n“specific and detailed provisions[ of] the INA expressly and \n—————— \n4The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful perma-\n \nnent residence status.  See §1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) (two years for spouses to \ndemonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of \nprocuring an  alien’s admission as an immigrant”); §1186b (qualifying  \nbusiness entrepreneurs). \n5For instance, Congress has  carved out rules for aliens who served in \n \nthe Armed Forces, §§1438–1440, and alien spouses who have been sub-\nject to domestic abuse, §§1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In light of this elaborate statutory scheme, the lack of \nany similar provision for DACA recipients convincingly es-\ntablishes that Congress left DHS with no discretion to cre-\nate an additional class of aliens eligible for lawful presence.  \nCongress knows well how to provide broad discretion, and\nit has provided open-ended delegations of authority in stat-\nutes too numerous to name.  But when it comes to lawful \npresence, Congress did something strikingly different.  In-\nstead of enacting  a statute with “broad general directives” \nand leaving it to the agency to fill in the lion’s share of the \ndetails,  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.  S.  361,  372 \n(1989), Congress put in place intricate specifications gov-\nerning eligibility for lawful presence.  This comprehensive \nscheme indicates that DHS has no discretion to supplement \nor amend the statutory provisions in any manner, least of \nall by memorandum.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (An agency “may not \nexercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with \nthe administrative structure that Congress enacted” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); see also ETSI Pipeline Pro-\nject v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 509–510 (1988). \n2 \n  The relief that Congress has extended to removable al-\niens likewise confirms that DACA exceeds DHS’ delegated \nauthority.  Through deferred action, DACA grants tempo-\nrary relief to removable aliens on a programmatic scale.  \nSee Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d, at 714.  But as with lawful pres-\nence, Congress did not expressly grant DHS the authority \nto create categorical exceptions to the statute’s removal re-\nquirements.  And again, as with lawful presence, the intri-\ncate level of detail in the federal immigration laws regard-\ning  relief  from  removal  indicates  that  DHS  has  no  \ndiscretionary authority to supplement that relief with an  \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nentirely new programmatic exemption.\n  At the outset, Congress clearly knows how to provide for \nclasswide deferred action when it wishes to do so.  On mul-\ntiple  occasions,  Congress  has  used  express  language  to \nmake certain classes of individuals eligible for deferred ac-\ntion. See 8 U. S. C. §§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (certain indi-\nviduals covered under the Violence Against Women Act are \n“eligible for deferred action”); Victims of Trafficking and Vi-\nolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522 (“‘Any individ-\n \nual described in subclause (I) is  eligible for deferred ac-\ntion’”); Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Ter-\nrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, §423(b), 115 Stat. \n361 (“Such  spouse, child, son, or daughter may be eligible \nfor deferred action”); National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, §§1703(c)(1)(A), (2), 117 Stat. 1694–\n1695 (“Such spouse or child shall be eligible for deferred ac-\ntion”).6  Congress has failed to provide similar explicit pro-\nvisions for DACA recipients, and the immigration laws con-\ntain no indication that DHS can, at will, create its own \ncategorical policies for deferred action. \n  Other provisions pertaining to relief from removal fur-\nther demonstrate that DHS lacked the delegated authority  \n—————— \n6In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action pro-\n \ngrams have been implemented by the Executive Branch without explicit \nlegislation.  But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive]  \n \npower.’ ” Medellín v.  Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 532 (2008) (quoting  Dames & \n \nMoore v.  Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981)).  If any of these programs had \nbeen challenged, it would seem that they would be legally infirm for the  \nsame reasons as DACA.  Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create \nnew categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ \ndeferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise.   Duncan v.  \nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, \nand Congress is no closer to a legislative solution than it was in 2012.   \nSee, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H. R. 6, 116th Cong., \n1st Sess.  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nto create DACA.  As with lawful presence, Congress has \nprovided a plethora of methods by which aliens may seek \nrelief from removal.  For instance, both permanent and \ntemporary residents can seek cancellation of removal if  \nthey meet certain residency requirements and have not \ncommitted certain crimes.  §§1229b(a)–(b).  And certain \nnonpermanent residents may have their status adjusted to \npermanent  residence  during  these  proceedings.  \n§1229b(b)(2). Aliens can apply for asylum or withholding of \nremoval during removal proceedings unless they have com-\nmitted certain crimes.  §§1158, 1231(b)(3).  Applicants for \ncertain nonimmigrant visas may be granted a stay of re-\nmoval until the visa application is adjudicated.  §1227(d).  \nAnd, aliens may voluntarily depart rather than be subject\nto an order of removal. §1229c.\n  In sum, like lawful presence, Congress has provided for \nrelief from removal in specific and complex ways.  This nu-\nanced detail indicates that Congress has provided the full \npanoply of methods it thinks should be available for an al-\nien to seek relief from removal, leaving no discretion to DHS \nto provide additional programmatic forms of relief.7  \n3 \n  Finally, DHS could not appeal to general grants of au-\nthority, such as the Secretary’s ability to “perform such\nother acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his au-\nthority under the provisions of this chapter,” §1103(a)(3), or \nto “[e]stablis[h] national immigration enforcement policies\nand  priorities,”  6  U. S. C.  §202(5).    See  also  8  U. S. C.  \n§1103(g)(2).  Because we must interpret the statutes “as a \n—————— \n7It is uncontested that deferred action frequently occurs  on a case-by-\n \ncase basis, often justified on the grounds that the agency lacks resources  \nto remove all removable aliens.  Even assuming that these ad hoc exer-\ncises of discretion are permissible, however, we  have stated that “[a]n \nagency confronting resource  constraints may change its own conduct, but \nit cannot change the law.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.  EPA, 573 U. S.  \n302, 327 (2014). \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 561, 569 (1995), these grants of au-\nthority must be read alongside the express limits contained \nwithin the statute.  Basing the Secretary’s ability to com-\npletely overhaul immigration law on these general grants \nof  authority  would  eviscerate  that  deliberate  statutory \nscheme by “allow[ing the Secretary of DHS] to grant lawful  \npresence  . .  .  to  any  illegal  alien  in  the  United States.”  \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 184.  Not only is this “an untenable po-\nsition in light of the INA’s intricate system,” ibid., but it \nwould also render many of those provisions wholly super-\nfluous due to DHS’ authority to disregard them at will, \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  And in addi-\ntion to these fatal problems, adopting a broad interpreta-\ntion of these general grants of authority would run afoul of \nthe presumption that “Congress . . . does not alter the fun-\ndamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or \nancillary  provisions.”  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  \nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).  And it would also  \nconflict with the major questions doctrine, which is based \non the expectation that  Congress speaks clearly when it del-\negates the power to make “decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, \n573  U. S.  302,  324  (2014)  (UARG)  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted); see also  Texas, 787 F. 3d, at 760–761. \n  Read together, the detailed statutory provisions govern-\ning temporary and lawful permanent resident status, relief \nfrom removal, and classwide deferred-action programs lead\nineluctably to the conclusion that DACA is “inconsisten[t] \nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.”  \nUniversity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, \n570 U. S. 338, 353 (2013).  As the District Court stated in \nthe DAPA litigation and as then-Attorney General Sessions \nagreed, “[i]nstead of merely refusing to enforce the INA’s \nremoval laws against an individual, the DHS has enacted a \nwide-reaching program that awards legal presence . . . to  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 654 (SD Tex.  \n2015). The immigration statutes contain a level of granular \nspecificity that is exceedingly rare in the modern adminis-\ntrative state.  It defies all logic and common sense to con-\nclude that a statutory scheme detailed enough to provide \nconditional lawful presence to groups as narrowly defined\nas “alien entrepreneurs,” §1186b, is simultaneously capa-\ncious enough for DHS to grant lawful presence to almost \ntwo million  illegal aliens with the stroke of a Cabinet secre-\ntary’s pen. \nB \n  Then-Attorney General Sessions concluded that the ini-\ntial DACA program suffered from the “same legal . . . de-\nfects” as DAPA and expanded DACA, finding that, like \nthose programs, DACA was implemented without statutory\nauthority. App. 877–878. Not only was this determination \ncorrect, but it is also dispositive for purposes of our review.  \n“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power . . .  \nis limited to the authority granted by Congress.”  Bowen v.  \nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988).  DHS \nhad no authority here to create DACA, and the unlawful-\nness of that program is a sufficient justification for its re-\nscission.  \n  The majority opts for a different path, all but ignoring \nDACA’s substantive legal defect.  See ante, at 18–19.  On \nthe majority’s understanding of APA review, DHS was re-\nquired to provide additional policy justifications in order to \nrescind an action that it had no authority to take.  This rule \n“has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for [it] is \nconspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.”  Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 536 (2007) (ROBERTS, C. J., dis-\nsenting).\n  The lack of support for the majority’s position is hardly  \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

No court can compel Executive Branch officials to ex-\nceed their congressionally delegated powers by continuing \na program that was void ab initio. Cf. Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U. S. 417 (1998); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919  \n(1983); see also EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., \n572 U. S. 489, 542, n. 5 (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Public \nCitizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 487 (1989) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  In reviewing agency\naction, our role is to ensure that Executive Branch officials  \ndo not transgress the proper bounds of their authority, Ar-\nlington, 569 U. S., at 327 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), not \nto perpetuate a decision to unlawfully wield power in direct \ncontravention  of  the enabling  statute’s  clear  limits,  see \nUARG, 573 U. S., at 327–328; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n  Under our precedents, DHS can only exercise the author-\nity that Congress has chosen to delegate to it.  See UARG, \n573 U. S., at 327.  In implementing DACA, DHS under the \nObama administration arrogated to itself power it was not \ngiven by Congress. Thus, every action taken by DHS under \nDACA is the unlawful exercise of power.  Now, under the  \nTrump administration, DHS has provided the most compel-\nling reason to rescind DACA: The program was unlawful \nand would force DHS to continue acting unlawfully if it car-\nried the program forward.  \nIII  \n  The majority’s demanding review of DHS’ decisionmak-\ning process is especially perverse given that the 2012 mem-\norandum flouted the APA’s procedural requirements—the\nvery  requirements  designed  to  prevent  arbitrary  deci-\nsionmaking. Even if DHS were authorized to create DACA,  \nit could not do so without undertaking an administrative \nrulemaking.  The fact that DHS did not engage in this pro-\ncess likely provides an independent basis for rescinding \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nDACA.  But at the very least, this procedural defect com-\npounds the absurdity of the majority’s position in these \ncases. \n  As described above, DACA fundamentally altered the im-\nmigration laws. It created a new category of aliens who, as \na class, became exempt from statutory removal procedures, \nand it gave those aliens temporary lawful presence.  Both \nchanges contravened statutory limits.  DACA is thus what  \nis commonly called a substantive or legislative rule.8  As the  \nname implies, our precedents state that legislative rules \nare those that “have the force and effect of law.”  Chrysler  \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Our  precedents  allow  the  vast  majority  of  legislative \nrules to proceed through so-called “informal” notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  See United States v. Florida East \nCoast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973).9 But under our \nprecedents, an agency must engage in certain procedures \nmandated by the APA before its rule carries legal force.  Ki-\nsor v. Wilkie, 588 U.

These procedures specify that the \nagency “shall” publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in  \n—————— \n8The majority  tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must.  See ante, at \n \n11–12.  Otherwise, the majority would have to accept that DACA was \nnothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make \nits rescission  unreviewable.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831  \n(1985). \n9As I have previously pointed out, “the APA actually contemplated a  \n \nmuch more formal process  for most rulemaking.”   Perez v. Mortgage  \nBankers Assn., 575 U. S. 92, 128, n.  5 (2015) (opinion concurring in judg-\nment). \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. C. §§553(b)–(c); see also Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opin-\nion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17). As we have recognized\nrecently, use of the word “shall” indicates that these proce-\ndures impose mandatory obligations on the agency before it \ncan adopt a valid binding regulation.  See Maine Commu-\nnity Health Options v.  United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___  \n(2020) (slip op., at 12).  After undergoing notice and com-\nment, the agency then publishes the final rule, which must \n“articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the] action in-\ncluding a rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United  \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463  \nU. S.  29,  43  (1983)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  \nOnly after completing this process is the legislative rule a \nvalid law. See Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, \nJ.) (slip op., at 17).10  \n  Because DACA has the force and effect of law, DHS was  \nrequired to observe the procedures set out in the APA if it \nwanted to promulgate a legislative rule.  It is undisputed, \nhowever, that DHS did not do so.  It provided no oppor-\ntunity for interested parties to submit comments regarding \nthe effect that the program’s dramatic and very significant \nchange in immigration law would have on various aspects \nof society.  It provided no discussion of economic considera-\ntions or national security interests.  Nor did it provide any \nsubstantial policy justifications for treating young people \n—————— \n10The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment \n \nrulemaking.  For example, an agency may promulgate a legally binding \nrule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so.  5 U.  S. C.  \n§553(b)(B).  This text would become a nullity if the agency  could achieve \nthe same effect by simply dispensing with notice and comment proce-\ndures altogether. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

And, it did not invoke any law authorizing  \nDHS to create such a program beyond its inexplicable as-\nsertion that DACA  was consistent with existing law.  Be-\ncause DHS failed to engage in the statutorily mandated\nprocess, DACA never gained status as a legally binding reg-\nulation that could impose duties or obligations on third par-\nties.  See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 23);  id., \nat ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17).\n  Given this state of affairs, it is unclear to me why DHS \nneeded to provide any explanation whatsoever when it de-\ncided to rescind DACA.  Nothing in the APA suggests that \nDHS was required to spill any ink justifying the rescission\nof an invalid legislative rule, let alone that it was required \nto provide policy justifications beyond acknowledging that \nthe program was simply unlawful from the beginning.  And,  \nit is well established that we do not remand for an agency \nto correct its reasoning when it was required by law to take \nor abstain from an action.  See Morgan Stanley Capital \nGroup Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 \nU. S. 527, 544–545 (2008).  Here, remand would be futile,  \nbecause no amount of policy explanation could cure the fact \nthat DHS lacked statutory authority to enact DACA in the \nfirst place.\n  Instead of recognizing this, the majority now requires the \nrescinding Department to treat the invalid rule as though \nit were legitimate.  As just explained, such a requirement \nis not supported by the APA.11  It is also absurd, as evi-\ndenced by its application to DACA in these cases.  The ma-\njority insists that DHS was obligated to discuss its choices \nregarding benefits and forbearance in great detail, even \n—————— \n11Thus, it is not  that the APA “should  not” be construed to support the \n \nmajority’s result, ante, at 26 (emphasis added), it is that the APA does  \nnot and cannot support that result. \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nthough no such detailed discussion accompanied DACA’s is-\nsuance. And, the majority also requires DHS to discuss re-\nliance interests at length, even though deferred action tra-\nditionally does not take reliance interests into account and \nDHS was not forced to explain its treatment of reliance in-\nterests in the first instance by going through notice and \ncomment.  See infra, at 23–24.  The majority’s demand for\nsuch an explanation here simply makes little sense. \n  At bottom, of course, none of this matters, because DHS  \ndid provide a sufficient explanation for its action.  DHS’ \nstatement that DACA was ultra vires  was more than suffi-\ncient to justify its rescission.12  By requiring more, the ma-\njority has distorted the APA review process beyond recogni-\ntion,  further  burdening  all  future  attempts  to  rescind \nunlawful programs.  Plaintiffs frequently bring successful \nchallenges to agency actions by arguing that the agency has \nimpermissibly dressed up a legislative rule as a policy state-\nment and must comply with the relevant procedures before \nfunctionally binding regulated parties.  See, e.g., Mendoza  \nv. Perez, 754 F. 3d 1002 (CADC 2014); Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 643 F. 3d 311 (CADC 2011); Na-\ntional Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn., Inc.  \nv. Sullivan, 979 F. 2d 227 (CADC 1992).  But going forward, \nwhen a rescinding agency inherits an invalid legislative\nrule that ignored virtually every rulemaking requirement \nof the APA, it will be obliged to overlook that reality.  In-\nstead of simply terminating the program because it did not \ngo through the requisite process, the agency will be com-\npelled to treat an invalid legislative rule as though it were \nlegitimate.13  \n—————— \n12I express no view on what other reasons would justify  an agency’s  \n \ndecision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action.  I merely point out \nthat correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n13In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immi-\n \ngration laws and had complied with the APA, it would still violate the \nConstitution as an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  See  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

The majority, therefore, claims that, notwith-\nstanding  the  then-Attorney  General’s  legal  conclusion, \nthen-Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider re-\nvoking  DACA  recipients’  lawful  presence  and  other  at-\ntendant benefits while continuing to defer their removal.  \nAnte, at 22–23. Even assuming the majority correctly char-\nacterizes the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, it cites no authority for \nthe proposition that arbitrary and capricious review re-\nquires an agency to dissect an unlawful program piece by \npiece,  scrutinizing  each  separate  element  to  determine \nwhether it would independently violate the law, rather \nthan just to rescind the entire program.14  \n—————— \nDepartment of Transportation v.  Association of American Railroads, 575  \nU. S. 43, 77 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).  Putting aside \nthis constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment process at \nleast attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some \nof the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rule-\nmaking process.  Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51  \nAdmin. L. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n14The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly \n \nquestionable.  Because a grant of deferred action renders DACA recipi-\nents eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from \nclear that the Department could separate  DACA’s “forbearance compo-\nnent” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet an-\nother APA problem.  The majority points to the fact that, under the Pa-\ntient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, relevant regulations \nexclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage.  \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  The then-Attorney General reviewed the thorough deci-\nsions of the District Court and the Fifth Circuit.  Those \ncourts exhaustively examined the INA’s text and structure, \nthe relevant provisions of other federal immigration stat-\nutes, the historical practice of deferred action, and the gen-\neral grants of statutory authority to set immigration policy.  \nBoth decisions concluded that  DAPA and expanded DACA \nviolated the carefully crafted federal immigration scheme, \nthat such violations could not be justified through reference \nto past exercises of deferred action, and that the general \ngrants of statutory authority did not give DHS the power to \nenact such a sweeping nonenforcement program. Based on  \nthe reasoning of those decisions, then-Attorney General \nSessions concluded that DACA was likewise implemented \nwithout statutory authority.  He directed DHS to restore \nthe rule of law.  DHS followed the then-Attorney General’s \nlegal analysis and rescinded the program.  This legal con-\nclusion more than suffices to supply the “reasoned analysis” \nnecessary to rescind an unlawful program. State Farm, 463  \nU. S., at 42.  \n  The majority has no answer except to suggest that this \napproach is inconsistent with  State Farm.  See ante, at 21– \n22.  But in doing so, the majority ignores the fact that, un-\nlike the typical “prior policy” contemplated by the Court in  \n—————— \nAnte, at 19, n. 5.  But that misses the point.  Those regulations were \npromulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the DACA pro-\ncess applie[d]” for those benefits.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012).  By \ncontrast, DACA recipients have been eligible for and have received Med-\nicare, Social Security, and work authorization for  years.  DHS therefore \nis not writing on a blank slate.  Under the majority’s rule, DHS would  \nneed to amend all relevant regulations and explain why all recipients of\ndeferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer \nreceive them.  Alternatively and perhaps  more problematically, it would \nneed to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred action should  \ncontinue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not.  It thus seems  \nhighly likely that the majority’s proposed course of action would be sub-\nject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nState Farm, DACA is unlawful.  Neither State Farm nor \nany other decision cited by the majority addresses what an \nagency must do when it has inherited an unlawful program.  \nIt is perhaps for this reason that, rather than responding \nwith authority of its own, the majority simply opts to excise \nthe “unlawful policy” aspect from its discussion. \nB \n  Second, the majority claims that DHS erred by failing to \ntake into account the reliance interests of DACA recipients.   \nAnte, at 23–26.  But reliance interests are irrelevant when  \nassessing whether to rescind an action that the agency \nlacked statutory authority to take.  No amount of reliance \ncould ever justify continuing a program that allows DHS to \nwield power that neither Congress nor the Constitution \ngave it. Any such decision would be “not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U. S. C. \n§§706(2)(A), (C). Accordingly, DHS would simply be engag-\ning in yet another exercise of unlawful power if it used reli-\nance interests to justify continuing the initially unlawful \nprogram, and a court would be obligated to set aside that \naction.15  \n  Even if reliance interests were sometimes relevant when \nrescinding an ultra vires action, the rescission still would \nnot be arbitrary and capricious here.  Rather, as the major-\nity does not dispute, the rescission is consistent with how\ndeferred action has always worked.  As a general matter, \ndeferred action creates no rights—it exists at the Govern-\nment’s discretion and can be revoked at any time.  See App.  \n—————— \n15The majority contends that this argument does not carry force be-\n \ncause the rescission implemented a winddown period during which re-\ncipients would continue to receive benefits.  But whether DHS’ decision \nto wind down DACA was lawful is a separate question from whether \nDHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing an \nunlawful program. \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

Reg. 63249, 63253 (1997) (discussing \nExec. Order No. 12711 for certain citizens of the People’s \nRepublic of China).  The Government has made clear time \nand again that, because “deferred action is not an immigra-\ntion status, no alien has the right to deferred action.  It is  \nused solely in the discretion of the [Government] and con-\nfers no protection or benefit upon an alien.” DHS Immigra-\ntion and Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Re-\nmoval, Detention and Deportation Officers’ Field Manual \n§20.8 (Mar. 27, 2006); see also Memorandum from D.

Thus, con-\ntrary to the majority’s unsupported assertion,  ante, at 23,  \nthis longstanding administrative treatment of deferred ac-\ntion provides strong evidence and authority for the proposi-\ntion that an agency need not consider reliance interests in\nthis context.16  \n  Finally, it is inconceivable to require DHS to study reli-\nance interests before rescinding DACA considering how the \nprogram was previously defended.  DHS has made clear \nsince DACA’s inception that it would not consider such re-\nliance interests.  Contemporaneous with the DACA memo, \nDHS stated that “DHS can terminate or renew deferred ac-\ntion at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  Consideration  \n—————— \n16The majority’s  approach will make it far  more difficult to change \n \ndeferred-action programs going forward, which is hardly in keeping with \nthis Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in  \nadministrative discretion” used for administrative “convenience.”  Reno  \nv. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999).  \nAgencies will likely be less willing to grant deferred action knowing that \nany attempts to  undo it  will  require years of litigation and time-consuming \nrulemakings.  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In fact,  \nDHS repeatedly argued in court that the 2014 memoran-\ndum was a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion in part \nbecause deferred action created no rights on which recipi-\nents could rely.  Before the Fifth Circuit, DHS stated that  \n“DHS may revoke or terminate deferred action and begin \nremoval proceedings at any time at its discretion.”  Brief for  \nAppellants in Texas v.  United States, No. 15–40238, p. 7;  \nsee also id., at 45–46.  And before this Court, in that same  \nlitigation, DHS reiterated that “DHS has absolute discre-\ntion to revoke deferred action unilaterally, without notice \nor process.”  Brief for United States in United States v. \nTexas, O. T. 2015, No. 15–674, p. 5; see also id., at 37.  If \nthat treatment of reliance interests was incorrect, it pro-\nvides yet one more example of a deficiency in DACA’s issu-\nance, not its rescission.  \n*  *  * \n  President Trump’s Acting Secretary of Homeland Secu-\nrity inherited a program created by President Obama’s Sec-\nretary that was implemented without statutory authority \nand  without  following  the  APA’s  required  procedures.  \nThen-Attorney General Sessions correctly concluded that \nthis ultra vires program should be rescinded.  These cases \ncould—and should—have ended with a determination that \nhis legal conclusion was correct. \n  Instead, the majority today concludes that DHS was re-\nquired to do far more.  Without grounding its position in  \neither the APA or precedent, the majority declares that \nDHS was required to overlook  DACA’s obvious legal defi-\nciencies and provide additional policy reasons and justifica-\ntions before restoring the rule of law.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of ALITO,  J. \nnow  plays  in  our  constitutional system  should  consider\nwhat has happened in these cases.  Early in the term of the\ncurrent President, his administration took the controver-\nsial step of attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Shortly thereafter, \none of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked \nthis rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in \nlitigation.  In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed \npetitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not \nresolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells \nthe Department of Homeland Security to go back and try \nagain. What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, with-\nout holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented \nthat from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  \nOur constitutional system is not supposed to work that way. \n  I join JUSTICE THOMAS’s opinion.   DACA presents a deli-\ncate political issue, but that is not our business. As JUSTICE \nTHOMAS explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and \nthat alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even  \nif DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for over-\nturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA repre-\nsented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its re-\nscission represented an exercise of that same discretion, \nand it would therefore be unreviewable under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the ex-\ntent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and \ncapricious for essentially the reasons explained by JUSTICE \nKAVANAUGH.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \n  For the last 20 years, the country has engaged in conse-\nquential policy, religious, and moral debates about the legal \nstatus of millions of young immigrants who, as children, \nwere brought to the United States and have lived here ever \nsince.  Those young immigrants do not have legal status in \nthe United States under current statutory law.  They live, \ngo to school, and work here with uncertainty about their \nfutures.  Despite many attempts over the last two decades, \nCongress has not yet enacted legislation to afford legal sta-\ntus to those immigrants. \n  In 2012, exercising its view of the Executive’s prosecuto-\nrial discretion under Article II and the immigration laws, \nPresident Obama’s administration unilaterally instituted a \nprogram known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nor DACA.  Under DACA, eligible young immigrants may \napply for and receive deferred action.  They must renew \ntheir DACA status every two years.  Under the program, \nthe Executive Branch broadly forbears from enforcing cer-\ntain immigration removal laws against DACA recipients.  \nAnd by virtue of the forbearance, DACA recipients also be-\ncome eligible for work authorization and other benefits. \n  Since  2017,  President  Trump’s  administration  has \nsought to rescind DACA based on its different and narrower \nunderstanding of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion \nunder Article II and the immigration laws.  In its view, the \nExecutive Branch legally may not, and as a policy matter \nshould not, unilaterally forbear from enforcing the immi-\ngration laws against such a large class of individuals.  The \ncurrent administration has stated that it instead wants to \nwork with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that \nwould address the legal status of those immigrants together \nwith other significant immigration issues. \n  The question before the Court is whether the Executive \nBranch acted lawfully in ordering rescission of the ongoing \nDACA program.  To begin with, all nine Members of the \nCourt accept, as do the DACA plaintiffs themselves, that \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nthe Executive Branch possesses the legal authority to re-\nscind DACA and to resume pre-DACA enforcement of the \nimmigration laws enacted by Congress.  Having previously \nadopted a policy of prosecutorial discretion and nonenforce-\nment with respect to a particular class of offenses or indi-\nviduals, the Executive Branch has the legal authority to re-\nscind such a policy and resume enforcing the law enacted \nby Congress.  The Executive Branch’s exercise of that re-\nscission authority is subject to constitutional constraints \nand may also be subject to statutory constraints.  The nar-\nrow legal dispute here concerns a statutory constraint—\nnamely, whether the Executive Branch’s action to rescind \nDACA satisfied the general arbitrary-and-capricious stand-\nard of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. \n  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  \nAs the Court has long stated, judicial review under that \nstandard is deferential to the agency.  The Court may not \nsubstitute its policy judgment for that of the agency.  The \nCourt simply ensures that the agency has acted within a \nbroad zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reason-\nably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  ex-\nplained the decision.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U. S. 502 (2009); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29 (1983). \n  The Executive Branch explained its decision to rescind \nDACA in two sequential memorandums by successive Sec-\nretaries of Homeland Security: the 2017 Duke Memoran-\ndum and the 2018 Nielsen Memorandum.  The Duke Mem-\norandum focused on DACA’s perceived legal flaws.  The \nCourt today finds the Duke Memorandum insufficient un-\nder the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  But regardless of whether the Court is correct about the \nDuke Memorandum, the Nielsen Memorandum more fully \nexplained the Department’s legal reasons for rescinding \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA, and clarified that even if DACA were lawful, the De-\npartment would still rescind DACA for a variety of policy \nreasons.    The  Nielsen  Memorandum  also  expressly  ad-\ndressed the reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nquestion under the APA’s deferential arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious standard is not whether we agree with the Depart-\nment’s decision to rescind DACA.  The question is whether \nthe Nielsen Memorandum reasonably explained the deci-\nsion to rescind DACA.  Under ordinary application of the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memoran-\ndum—with its alternative and independent rationales and \nits discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an expla-\nnation for the Executive Branch’s action. \n  The Nielsen Memorandum was issued nine months after \nthe Duke Memorandum.  Under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, the Nielsen Memorandum is itself a “rule” setting \nforth “an agency statement of general . . . applicability and \nfuture effect designed to implement . . . policy.”  5 U. S. C. \n§551(4).  Because it is a rule, the Nielsen Memorandum con-\nstitutes “agency action.”  §551(13).  As the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Nielsen had the authority to \ndecide whether to stick with Secretary Duke’s decision to \nrescind DACA, or to make a different decision.  Like Secre-\ntary Duke, Secretary Nielsen chose to rescind DACA, and \nshe provided additional explanation.  Her memorandum \nwas akin to common forms of agency action that follow ear-\nlier agency action on the same subject—for example, a sup-\nplemental or new agency statement of policy, or an agency \norder with respect to a motion for rehearing or reconsider-\nation.  Courts often consider an agency’s additional expla-\nnations of policy or additional explanations made, for exam-\nple, on agency rehearing or reconsideration, or on remand \nfrom a court, even if the agency’s bottom-line decision itself \ndoes not change. \n  Yet the Court today jettisons the Nielsen Memorandum \nby classifying it as a post hoc justification for rescinding \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA.  Ante, at 14–16.  Under our precedents, however, the \npost hoc justification doctrine merely requires that courts \nassess agency action based on the official explanations of \nthe agency decisionmakers, and not based on after-the-fact \nexplanations advanced by agency lawyers during litigation \n(or  by  judges).   See,  e.g.,  State  Farm, 463 U. S., at  50 \n(“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc ration-\nalizations for agency action”); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. \n380, 397 (1974) (same); NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n380 U. S. 438, 443–444 (1965) (same); Burlington Truck \nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) \n(same).  As the D. C. Circuit has explained, the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine “is not a time barrier which freezes an \nagency’s exercise of its judgment after an initial decision \nhas been made and bars it from further articulation of its \nreasoning.  It is a rule directed at reviewing courts which \nforbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of ra-\ntionales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  deci-\nsionmakers.”  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 6 \n(2006) (Garland, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Indeed, the ordinary judicial remedy for an agency’s in-\nsufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation \nby the relevant agency personnel.  It would make little \nsense for a court to exclude official explanations by agency \npersonnel such as a Cabinet Secretary simply because the \nexplanations are purportedly post hoc, and then to turn \naround and remand for further explanation by those same \nagency personnel.  Yet that is the upshot of the Court’s ap-\nplication of the post hoc justification doctrine today.  The \nCourt’s refusal to look at the Nielsen Memorandum seems \nparticularly  mistaken,  moreover,  because  the  Nielsen \nMemorandum shows that the Department, back in 2018, \nconsidered the policy issues that the Court today says the \nDepartment did not consider.  Ante, at 20–26. \n  To be sure, cases such as Overton Park and Camp v. Pitts \nsuggest that courts reviewing certain agency adjudications \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nmay in some circumstances decline to examine an after-the-\nfact agency explanation.  See Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, \n142–143 (1973) (per curiam); Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 419–421 (1971).  But \nagency adjudications are “concerned with the determina-\ntion of past and present rights and liabilities,” Attorney \nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 14 \n(1947), and implicate the due process interests of the indi-\nvidual parties to the adjudication.  Judicial review of an ad-\njudication therefore ordinarily focuses on what happened \nduring the agency’s adjudication process of deciding that in-\ndividual case. \n  Even if certain agency adjudications have a slightly more \nstringent restriction on post hoc explanations, the APA is \n“based upon a dichotomy between rule making and adjudi-\ncation,” ibid., and this case involves an ongoing agency rule \nthat has future effect—the rescission of DACA.  The Nielsen \nMemorandum implements and explains the rescission of \nDACA.  I am aware of no case from this Court, and the \nCourt today cites none, that has employed the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine to exclude an agency’s official explana-\ntion of an agency rule.  For purposes of arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious review, it does not matter whether the latest official \nexplanation was two years ago or three years ago.  What \nmatters is whether the explanation was reasonable and fol-\nlowed the requisite procedures.  In my view, the Court \nshould  consider  the  Nielsen  Memorandum  in  deciding \nwhether the Department’s rescission of DACA satisfies the \nAPA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  Because the Court excludes the Nielsen Memorandum, \nthe Court sends the case back to the Department of Home-\nland Security for further explanation.  Although I disagree \nwith the Court’s decision to remand, the only practical con-\nsequence of the Court’s decision to remand appears to be \nsome delay.

In contrast to those \nnecessarily  short-lived  and  stopgap  administrative \nmeasures, the Article I legislative process could produce a \nsturdy and enduring solution to this issue, one way or the \nother, and thereby remove the uncertainty that has per-\nsisted for years for these young immigrants and the Na-\n—————— \n*Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s ar-\n \nbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not consider whether its prose-\ncutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” \nand therefore not subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the \nfirst place.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  Several judges have advanced argu-\nments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an \nexercise of forbearance authority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions \nabout whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial discretion \nagainst a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable \nunder the APA as “committed to agency discretion by law.”  Ibid.; see \nCasa De Maryland v.

On the \nsame day, the district court entered an order requiring defendants to promptly file \nand serve a completed administrative record consistent with the requirements laid \nout in the district court’s October 17 order that formed the basis for the original \nmandamus petition.  See D.Ct. Dkt. No. 188.1  On November 17, defendants filed \nan emergency motion asking “this Court to stay its order pending the Supreme \nCourt’s resolution of” a stay application and petition that defendants have indicated \nthey expect to file in that Court.  Dkt. No. 36 at 2.  In its November 18 order \nsetting a deadline for response to defendants’ motion, this Court directed the \nparties to “address whether this court has jurisdiction to grant a stay of proceedings, \nor whether the motion for a stay should instead be filed in the district court.  See \nEllis v. U.S. Dist. Court, 360 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc).”  Dkt. No. 37. \nAs this Court’s November 18 order suggests, defendants’ motion is \nmisdirected.  Although defendants style their motion as one seeking a stay of this \nCourt’s order denying the mandamus petition, that order does not compel anyone \nto do anything—it merely denies extraordinary mandamus relief and immediately \nrestores the status quo ante in the district court.  There is no mandate from this \n                                           \n1 “D.Ct. Dkt.” refers to the docket in case No. 17-cv-5211-WHA. \n1 \n\n \nCourt to stay, nor any proceeding pending in this Court as to which a stay might \noperate in aid of this Court’s jurisdiction.  See Ellis, 360 F.3d at 1022-1023; \n28 U.S.C. § 1651. \nIt appears that what defendants are actually seeking is a stay of the district \ncourt’s November 16 order, directing them to proceed promptly to file and serve a \ncompleted administrative record.  See D.Ct. Dkt. No. 188.  But that type of stay \nwould ordinarily be sought first from the district court itself.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n8(a)(1)(A) (“A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for . . . a stay of \nthe judgment or order of a district court pending appeal”); cf. Sup. Ct. R. 23.3 \n(“Except in the most extraordinary circumstances, an application for a stay will not \nbe entertained unless the relief requested was first sought in the appropriate court \nor courts below or from a judge or judges thereof.”)  Indeed, defendants belatedly \nfiled a motion for a stay in the district court yesterday.  See D.Ct. Dkt. No. 191. \nAs it happens, the plaintiffs here agree that it would be sensible at this \nparticular juncture for the district court to temporarily stay its orders requiring \ncompletion and filing of the administrative record by November 22, although not \nin exactly the manner sought by defendants.  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction and defendants’ motion to dismiss are now pending in the district court, \nand will be fully briefed and argued by December 20.  A temporary stay until after \nthe district court rules on those motions would allow the parties to focus on the \n2 \n\n \nmost immediate issue of whether defendants’ decision to rescind DACA should be \nenjoined from taking effect while this litigation proceeds.  The district court’s \nruling on those motions could also either moot or clarify some of the arguments \nproffered by defendants in support of the extraordinary interlocutory relief that \ndefendants sought from this Court and have now indicated they otherwise intend to \npursue immediately in the Supreme Court.  A temporary stay would perhaps also \nobviate any perceived need for defendants to further multiply proceedings in this \ncase.   \nFor all these reasons, on November 19 plaintiffs themselves filed a motion in \nthe district court seeking a stay tailored to the circumstances of this case.  See D.Ct. \nDkt. No. 190.  This morning, the district court issued a tentative order that would \ndelay defendants’ obligation to file the augmented administrative record and stay \ndiscovery until December 22, two days after the scheduled hearing on plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction and defendants’ motion to dismiss.  See D.Ct. \nDkt. 193.  The district court invited the parties to respond to that tentative order by \nnoon today.  See ibid.  The parties’ filings in the district court, and the district \ncourt’s tentative order, make clear that issues relating to the details and timing of \nproceedings in this complex and rapidly evolving litigation are best managed by \nthe district court. \n3 \n\n \nFinally, even if this Court thought it appropriate to entertain defendants’ \ncurrent stay motion, defendants have failed to carry their burden of establishing \nany entitlement to a stay from this Court.  Their stay motion is perfunctory:  it \ncontains just 257 words and no argument or explanation concerning why the \npresent circumstances satisfy the factors governing issuance of a stay.  See, e.g., \nLair v. Bullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1203 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 434 (2009)).  Defendants do not discuss the balance of hardships or the \npublic interest, and they fail to explain why their arguments for extraordinary relief \nare likely to succeed before the Supreme Court after having failed before this Court.   \n4 \n\n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should deny defendants’ emergency motion for a stay.  \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nDated:  November 20, 2017  XAVIER BECERRA \n  Attorney General of California \nCOVINGTON & BURLING LLP  Edward C.

For the reasons discussed below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nThis order incorporates the statement set forth in the order dated January 9, 2018,\n25\nlargely denying dismissal under FRCP 12(b)(1) and largely granting plaintiffs’ motion for\n26\nprovisional relief (Dkt. No. 234).  This order, however, addresses a separate motion by the\n27\ngovernment to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim for relief under FRCP 12(b)(6). \n28\nThis order sustains three claims for relief but finds that the rest fall short.  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 14\n1 ANALYSIS\n2 1. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n3   For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the\n4 rescission of DACA was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n5 accordance with law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as explained in the\n6 January 9 order, the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ APA claims under 5 U.S.C. §\n7 706(2)(A) is DENIED.\n8 2. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n9 The original DACA program began in 2012 without any notice or opportunity for public\n10 comment.  Likewise, the rescission in question ended DACA without notice or opportunity for\nt 11 public comment.  One issue now presented is whether the rescission is invalid for having been\nr\nu\no a 12 carried out without notice-and-comment procedures.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Under the APA, an agency action must be set aside if it was done “without observance\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  An agency is required to follow\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 prescribed notice-and-comment procedures before promulgating certain rules.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \nS N 16 The Regulatory Flexibility Act further requires that notice-and-comment rulemaking include\nted  For the  17 an assessment of the impact on small entities.  5 U.S.C. § 604(a).  These requirements do not\ni\nn\nU\n18 apply, however, to general statements of policy.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  \n19 A general statement of policy “advis[es] the public prospectively of the manner in which\n20 the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d\n21 1006, 1012–13 (9th Cir. 1987).  Such policies also “serve to educate and provide direction to\n22 the agency’s personnel in the field, who are required to implement its policies and exercise its\n23 discretionary power in specific cases.”  Id. at 1013 (quotes and citations omitted).  “The critical\n24 factor” in determining whether a directive constitutes a general statement of policy is “the\n25 extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to\n26 exercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.” \n27 Ibid.  Thus, to qualify as a statement of policy two requirements must be satisfied:  (1) the\n28 policy operates only prospectively, and (2) the policy does “not establish a binding norm,” and\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 14\n1 is not “finally determinative of the issues or rights to which [it] address[es],” but instead leaves\n2 officials “free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise.”  Id. at 1014\n3 (quotes and citations omitted).  Under this standard, the rescission memorandum is a general\n4 statement of policy.\n5 This order rejects plaintiffs’ contention that the rescission could only be done through\n6 notice and comment.  For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed no notice\n7 and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.  \n8 Almost this exact problem was addressed in Mada-Luna.  There, our court of appeals\n9 held that the repeal of an INS policy under which applicants could seek deferred action was not\n10 subject to notice and comment.  It rejected the argument that the repeal could not constitute a\nt 11 general statement of policy because it diminished the likelihood of receiving deferred action for\nr\nu\no a 12 a class of individuals.  Id. at 1016.  Rather, because the original policy allowed for discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 and failed to establish a “binding norm,” the repeal of that policy also did not require notice and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 comment.  Id. at 1017.  So too here.  The DACA program allowed but did not require the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 agency to grant deferred action, and upon separate application, travel authorization, on a case-\nS N 16 by-case basis at the agency’s discretion.  Therefore, neither its promulgation nor its rescission\nted  For the  17 required notice and comment.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 Parco v. Morris, 426 F. Supp. 976 (E.D. Pa. 1977), on which plaintiffs heavily rely,\n19 does not warrant the conclusion that the rescission policy is a substantive rule.  Parco also\n20 addressed whether the rescission of an INS policy required notice and comment.  Notably, the\n21 government in Parco stipulated that the policy’s precipitous rescission was the sole reason for\n22 denial of the plaintiff’s application for immigration relief.  Id. at 984.  The district court\n23 determined that the repeal therefore left no discretion, explaining that “discretion” was stripped\n24 of all meaning where “one contends that under a certain regulation ‘discretion’ was exercised\n25 favorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal of the regulation, unfavorably in\n26 each such case.”  Ibid.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not allege that all deferred action\n27 applications under DACA were approved but now, after the rescission, all requests for deferred\n28 action will be denied.  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffs argue that the rescission memorandum is more than a policy because it creates\n2 a blanket prohibition against granting deferred action to DACA applicants.  Plaintiffs are\n3 correct that the rescission policy contains mandatory language on its face.  It is also true that the\n4 rescission memorandum categorically eliminates advance parole for DACA recipients. \n5 This comes closer to resembling a substantive rule.  However, it remains the case that because\n6 the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require notice and comment,\n7 a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.  Mada-Luna, 813 F.2d\n8 at 1017.  \n9 Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Section 706(2)(D) of the\n10 APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is accordingly GRANTED.\nt 11 3. DUE PROCESS CLAIMS.\nr\nu\no a 12 To assert a due process claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she has an interest in\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 liberty or property protected by the Constitution.  See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (1972).  Plaintiffs fail to make the threshold showing that they have a protected interest in the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 continuation of DACA and, accordingly, their due process claims based on the rescission must\nS N 16 be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged, however, that the agency’s changes to its\nted  For the  17 information-sharing policy are “fundamentally unfair.”  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. Deferred Action.\n19 Because discretionary immigration relief “is a privilege created by Congress, denial of\n20 such relief cannot violate a substantive interest protected by the Due Process clause.”  Munoz v.\n21 Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 30 (1996)). \n22 Moreover, “aliens have no fundamental right to discretionary relief from removal” for purposes\n23 of due process.  Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2004).  Our court of\n24 appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, since such relief\n25 is “entirely within the discretion of the Attorney General.”  Kwai Fun Wong v. United States,\n26 373 F.3d 952, 967–68 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor did an INS policy which allowed the agency to\n27 recommend deferred action as “an act of administrative choice” create substantive liberty\n28 interests.  Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1985).  These authorities\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 14\n1 foreclose any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in continued deferred action or\n2 advance parole under DACA.1\n3 Plaintiffs reply that even absent a protected interest in the initial, discretionary grant of\n4 deferred action, there is a protected interest in the renewal of DACA and its associated benefits. \n5 Yet a benefit is not a “protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it\n6 in their discretion.”  Castle Rock, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  Rather, an individual has a\n7 protected property right in public benefits where the rules conferring those benefits “greatly\n8 restrict the discretion” of the people who administer them.  Nozzi v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los\n9 Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs’ authorities confirm that the same\n10 principle applies in the context of renewing or retaining existing benefits.  Wedges/Ledges of\nt 11 California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 64 (9th Cir. 1994); Stauch v. City of\nr\nu\no a 12 Columbia Heights, 212 F.3d 425, 430 (8th Cir. 2000).  No such limitations on agency discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are alleged to have applied under DACA.  Rather, the USCIS DACA FAQs referenced by\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 plaintiffs in their complaints make clear that “USCIS retain[ed] the ultimate discretion to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether deferred action [was] appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines\nS N 16 [were] met” (Garcia Compl. ¶ 24 n.16; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; UC Compl., Exh. B; State\nted  For the  17 Compl., Exh. E).\ni\nn\nU\n18 Next, plaintiffs argue that once DACA status was conferred, and recipients organized\n19 their lives in reliance on the program’s protections and benefits, they developed interests\n20 protected by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ authorities, however, stand only for the\n21 uncontroversial proposition that once in possession of a particular benefit, the alteration,\n22 revocation or suspension of that benefit may implicate due process.2  Such a principle has no\n23 application where, as here, extant benefits are not impacted by a change in policy.  Indeed, there\n24 is no dispute that the rescission acts only prospectively.  That is, all existing DACA recipients\n25\n1  Plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish Romeiro de Silva on the ground that the INS policy there involved\n26\n“unfettered discretion,” whereas the exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA was guided by standard\noperating procedures, is unconvincing.  \n27\n2  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971); Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court For Dist. of Arizona,\n28\n349 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir. 2003); Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2017 WL 5176720, at *9\n(W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017).\n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 14\n1 will receive deferred action through the end of their two-year terms.  What they will not receive,\n2 if the rescission endures, will be DACA renewal, thereafter.  For this reason, Ixcot v. Holder,\n3 646 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011), and Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), which\n4 addressed whether amendments to the INA were impermissibly retroactive, do not compel a\n5 different result.\n6 Plaintiffs contend that the government’s communications with plaintiffs regarding\n7 renewals, its operation of the program, and the public promises of government officials\n8 “together created an understanding that DACA recipients were entitled to the continued benefits\n9 of the program so long as they met the renewal criteria” (Dkt. No. 205 at 29).  Plaintiffs are\n10 correct, of course, that claims of entitlement can be defined by “rules or mutually explicit\nt 11 understandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  Importantly, however, a\nr\nu\no a 12 person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 held, does not create a protected right if that belief is not mutually held by the government. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Gerhart v. Lake Cty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2011).  An agency’s past practice of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 generally granting a government benefit is also insufficient to establish a legal entitlement. \nS N 16 Ibid.\nted  For the  17 This order empathizes with those DACA recipients who have built their lives around\ni\nn\nU\n18 the expectation that DACA, and its associated benefits, would continue to be available to them\n19 if they played by the rules.  That expectation, however, remains insufficient to give rise to a\n20 constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment.  Because plaintiffs have failed to allege facts\n21 demonstrating a protected interest in DACA’s continuation or the renewal of benefits\n22 thereunder, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on the rescission\n23 must be GRANTED.  \n24 B. Information-Sharing Policy.\n25 Plaintiffs fare better with their substantive due process claim that DHS allegedly\n26 changed its policy with respect to the personal information provided by DACA recipients\n27 during the application process.  Plaintiffs allege that the government repeatedly represented\n28 that information provided by DACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 14\n1 purposes absent special circumstances, and that DACA recipients relied on these promises in\n2 submitting the extensive personal information needed to meet the program’s requirements.\n3 Defendants insist that the agency’s information-sharing policy remains unchanged. \n4 On a motion to dismiss, however, the well-pled factual allegations in a complaint must be\n5 accepted as true.  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir.\n6 2008).  Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that DHS changed its information-sharing policy such\n7 that now, rather than affirmatively protecting DACA recipients’ information from disclosure,\n8 the government will only refrain from “proactively” providing their information for purposes of\n9 immigration enforcement proceedings (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State\n10 Compl. ¶ 122).  \nt 11 Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged a “mutually explicit understanding” giving rise\nr\nu\no a 12 to a protected interest in the confidentiality of DACA recipients’ personal information. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 They allege that throughout DACA’s existence, DHS made affirmative representations as to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 how this information would (and would not) be used.  The policy stated (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126;\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State Compl. ¶ 121 (citing USCIS DACA FAQs)): \nS N 16 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nted  For the  17 tpor oIcCeEe dainndg sC uBnPle fsosr t hthee r pequurpeostsoer o mf eimetms tihgera ctiroitne reina ffoorrc ethmee insstuance\ni\nn of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set\nU\n18 forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance\n(www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred\n19 pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE.  The information\nmay be shared with national security and law enforcement\n20 agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\nincluding for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify\n21 or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for\nthe investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above\n22 information sharing policy covers family members and guardians,\nin addition to the requestor.  This policy, which may be modified,\n23 superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended\nto, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or\n24 benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party\nin any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n25\nThe language contained in the policy’s caveat, that it could “be modified, superseded,\n26\nor rescinded at any time,” is ambiguous.  One reading advanced by the government is that this\n27\ncaveat allows the agency to change how it treats information already received from DACA\n28\napplicants.  Another reading, however, is that it simply allows the government to change its\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 14\n1 policy in connection with future applicants.  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson’s\n2 December 2016 letter to United States Representative Judy Chu supports the later reading. \n3 He stated that, “[s]ince DACA was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that\n4 information provided by applicants . . . will not later be used for immigration enforcement\n5 purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security\n6 or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance\n7 of a notice to appear is required by law” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 36–37; State Compl. ¶ 98, Exh. F). \n8 This ambiguity presents a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings.  \n9 Taken as true at this stage, as must be done on a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion, plaintiffs’\n10 allegations regarding the government’s broken promise as to how DACA recipients’ personal\nt 11 information will be used — and its potentially profound consequences — “shock[s] the\nr\nu\no a 12 conscience and offend[s] the community’s sense of fair play and decency.”  Marsh v. County of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 San Diego, 680 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotes and citations omitted).  Defendants’\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on changes to the government’s\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 information-use policy is DENIED.  \nS N 16 4. EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL.\nted  For the  17 Plaintiffs bring claims for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government should not be\ni\nn\nU\n18 permitted to terminate DACA or use the information collected from applicants for immigration\n19 enforcement purposes. \n20 Defendants first contend that plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims fail because there is no\n21 recognized claim for relief based on estoppel.  The Supreme Court has refused to adopt,\n22 however, “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any circumstances run against the Government,”\n23 noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the Government can enforce the law free from\n24 estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum\n25 standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their Government.”  Heckler v.\n26 Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60–61 (1984).  Moreover, our court of\n27 appeals has addressed such claims on the merits, and has held that the government may be\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 9 of 14\n1 subject to equitable estoppel if it has engaged in “affirmative misconduct.”  Watkins v. U.S.\n2 Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706–07 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n3 To state an equitable estoppel claim against the government, a party must show\n4 (1) that the government engaged in “affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence”; and\n5 (2) “the government’s wrongful act will cause a serious injustice, and the public’s interest will\n6 not suffer undue damage” if the requested relief is granted.  Id. at 707.  “Neither the failure to\n7 inform an individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation\n8 constitute affirmative misconduct.”  Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 2000). \n9 Moreover, our court of appeals has defined “affirmative misconduct” to mean a “deliberate lie”\n10 or “a pattern of false promises.”  Socop-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001). \nt 11 The allegations in the complaints fail to meet this standard, inasmuch as no affirmative instances\nr\nu\no a 12 of misrepresentation or concealment have been plausibly alleged.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs are correct that estoppel “does not require that the government intend to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 mislead a party,” Watkins, 875 F.2d 707, but plaintiffs fail to explain how contradictory policies\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 under two different administrations add up to “affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence.”\nS N 16  Plaintiffs fail to allege, for example, that the government’s past statements regarding DACA’s\nted  For the  17 legality were a “deliberate lie” or more than mere negligence.  Nor have plaintiffs pleaded that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the alleged change in the agency’s information-use policy was the result of an affirmative\n19 misrepresentation.  Rather, they have merely alleged a change in policy.  Under plaintiffs’ theory\n20 new administrations would almost never be able to change prior policies because someone could\n21 always assert reliance upon the old policy.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ equitable\n22 estoppel claims is GRANTED. \n23 5. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS.  \n24 To state an equal protection claim plaintiffs must show that the rescission was motivated\n25 by a discriminatory purpose.  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (2015) (citing Vill. of\n26 Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977)).  Determining\n27 whether discrimination is a motivating factor “demands a sensitive inquiry into such\n28 circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 10 of 14\n1 266.  A plaintiff need not show that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the\n2 challenged action, but only that it was a “motivating factor.”  Ibid.  In analyzing whether a\n3 facially-neutral policy was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, district courts must consider\n4 factors such as whether the policy creates a disparate impact, the historical background and\n5 sequence of events leading up to the decision, and any relevant legislative or administrative\n6 history.  Id. at 266–68.3  \n7 First, Individual Plaintiffs and Santa Clara clearly allege that the rescission had a\n8 disproportionate impact on Latinos and Mexican nationals.  Indeed, such individuals account\n9 for 93 percent of DACA recipients (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 100, 151; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 9, 75). \n10 Defendants reply that this disparate impact is an accident of geography, not evidence of\nt 11 discrimination.  True, a disparate impact of a facially-neutral rule, standing alone, cannot\nr\nu\no a 12 establish discriminatory intent.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976).  Individual\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs and Santa Clara, however, have alleged a discriminatory impact only as a starting\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 point.  They also allege a history of bias leading up to the rescission of DACA in the form of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 campaign statements and other public comments by President Trump, as next discussed.4 \nS N 16 Second, plaintiffs allege that President Trump has, on multiple occasions since he\nted  For the  17 announced his presidential campaign, expressed racial animus towards Latinos and Mexicans. \ni\nn\nU\n18 When President Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, for example, he\n19 characterized Mexicans as criminals, rapists, and “people that have lots of problems.”  Three\n20 days later, President Trump tweeted that “[d]ruggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming\n21 across the southern border,” and asked, “When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?” \n22\n23\n3  The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), which addressed\nthe showing necessary for a defendant to be entitled to discovery on a selective-prosecution claim, has no\n24\napplication here.  Plaintiffs’ claims cannot fairly be characterized as selective-prosecution claims because they\ndo not “implicate the Attorney General’s prosecutorial discretion — that is, in this context, his discretion to\n25\nchoose to deport one person rather than another among those who are illegally in the country.”  Kwai Fun\nWong, 373 F.3d at 970.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that the agency’s decision to end a nationwide deferred action\n26\nprogram was motivated by racial animus towards a protected class.  \n27\n4  The City of San Jose’s equal protection claim falls a little short.  Rather than alleging a disparate\nimpact on a protected class, it alleges only that “[d]efendants’ actions target individuals for discriminatory\n28\ntreatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification” (San Jose Compl. ¶ 54).  For this reason,\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss San Jose’s equal protection claim is GRANTED.  \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 11 of 14\n1 During the first Republican presidential debate, President Trump claimed that the Mexican\n2 government “send[s] the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them.”  And in\n3 August 2017, he referred to undocumented immigrants as “animals” who are responsible for “the\n4 drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, MS 13” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶\n5 102–13, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 75–76).\n6 Circumstantial evidence of intent, including statements by a decisionmaker, may be\n7 considered in evaluating whether government action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. \n8 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68.  These statements were not about the rescission (which\n9 came later) but they still have relevance to show racial animus against people south of our\n10 border. \nt 11 Should campaign rhetoric be admissible to undermine later agency action by the victors? \nr\nu\no a 12 This order recognizes that such admissibility can readily lead to mischief in challenging the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 policies of a new administration.  We should proceed with caution and give wide berth to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 democratic process.  Yet are clear cut indications of racial prejudice on the campaign trail to be\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 forgotten altogether?\nS N 16 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “evidence of purpose beyond the face of the\nted  For the  17 challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause\ni\nn\nU\n18 claims.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017).  Washington found that\n19 President Trump’s statements regarding a “Muslim ban” raised “serious allegations and\n20 presented significant constitutional questions,” although it ultimately reserved consideration of\n21 plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Id. at 1167–68.  Citing to Washington, at least two district\n22 courts have since considered President Trump’s campaign statements in finding a likelihood of\n23 success on Establishment Clause claims.  See, e.g., Aziz v. Trump, 234 F. Supp. 3d 724, 736\n24 (E.D. Va. 2017) (Judge Leonie Brinkema); Hawai’i v. Trump, 245 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236 (D.\n25 Haw. 2017) (Judge Derrick Watson).  This order will follow these decisions and hold that, at\n26 least at the pleading stage, campaign rhetoric so closely tied to the challenged executive action is\n27 admissible to show racial animus.  \n28\n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 14\n1 Third, a final consideration is the unusual history behind the rescission.  DACA received\n2 reaffirmation by the agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be\n3 hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality). \n4 This strange about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration\n5 within the agency was bypassed (Garcia Compl. ¶ 154; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 8, 77).  \n6 That President Trump has at other times shown support for DACA recipients cannot wipe\n7 the slate clean as a matter of law at the pleading stage.  Although the government argues that\n8 these allegations fail to suggest that the Acting Secretary (as the purported decisionmaker)\n9 terminated DACA due to racial animus, plaintiffs have alleged that it was President Trump\n10 himself who, in line with his campaign rhetoric, directed the decision to end the program\nt 11 (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 11, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 21).\nr\nu\no a 12 Construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as must be done at the pleading stage,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 these allegations raise a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.  The fact-intensive inquiry needed to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether defendants acted with discriminatory intent cannot be made on the pleadings. \nS N 16 Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss Santa Clara’s and Individual Plaintiffs’ equal\nted  For the  17 protection claims must be DENIED.\ni\nn\nU\n18 State Plaintiffs allege an equal protection claim on the alternative theory that the\n19 rescission “violates fundamental conceptions of justice by depriving DACA grantees, as a class,\n20 of their substantial interests in pursuing a livelihood to support themselves and further their\n21 education” (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77).  Plaintiffs do not respond to the government’s arguments\n22 that this theory fails to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6).  Defendants’ motion to dismiss State\n23 Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is accordingly GRANTED.  \n24 6. DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n25 Defendants move to dismiss the Individual Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief. \n26 Individual Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief is also contained in their prayer for relief and,\n27 accordingly, the standalone claim is superfluous.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim is\n28 GRANTED.\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 14\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 Consistent with the foregoing, defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and\n3 DENIED IN PART as follows:\n4 • Plaintiffs’ APA claims are sustained, except for the following:  Garcia\n5 Complaint – Fifth Claim for Relief; UC Complaint – Second Claim for\n6 Relief; State Complaint – Second Claim for Relief; San Jose Complaint\n7 – Second Claim for Relief.\n8 • Plaintiffs’ Regulatory Flexibility Act claims are dismissed.\n9 • Plaintiffs’ due process claims are sustained, except for the following: \n10 UC Complaint – Third Claim for Relief; Garcia Complaint –\nt 11 First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on the rescission);\nr\nu\no a 12 Santa Clara Complaint – First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the rescission).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims are sustained, except for the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 following:  State Complaint – Sixth Claim for Relief; San Jose\nS N 16 Complaint – First Claim for Relief.\nted  For the  17 • Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims are dismissed.\ni\nn\nU\n18 • Individual Plaintiffs’ declaratory relief claim is dismissed.  \n19 Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR DAYS from the date of\n20 this order to file motions, noticed on the normal 35-day track, seeking leave to amend solely\n21 as to the claims dismissed above.  Proposed amended complaints must be appended to each\n22 motion and plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how\n23 the amendments to the complaints cure the deficiencies identified herein and should include as\n24 an exhibit a redlined or highlighted version of the complaints identifying all changes.  \n25 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\n26 The district court hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues of whether\n27 (i) President Trump’s campaign statements are properly considered in evaluating plaintiffs’\n28 equal protection claims, (ii) whether the Individual Plaintiffs’ and County of Santa Clara’s\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 71   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 14\n1 allegations as pleaded state an equal protection claim, (iii) whether plaintiffs’ allegations\n2 concerning changes to the government’s information-sharing policy state a due process claim;\n3 (iv) whether plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under 5 U.S.C. § 553; and (v) whether\n4 plaintiffs have failed to state a due process claim based on the rescission of DACA.  This order\n5 finds that these are controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for\n6 difference of opinion and that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the\n7 litigation.  \n8\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n10\nt 11 Dated:  January 12, 2018.                                                            \nr\nu WILLIAM ALSUP\no a 12 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n14",

INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  For the last five years, young people who have lived in the United States since \n3  they were children, even though they were born in another country, have had the right to live, \n4  work and attend college if they met stringent requirements as set forth by the Deferred Action \n5  for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”).  Exhibit 1.  The success of these DREAMers, as they are \n6  known, has been an incredible story.  About 800,000 people who otherwise would not have had \n7  the opportunity to attend college or work have now had that ability, thus enriching the lives of \n8  themselves, their families, and their communities.  Under DACA, Plaintiff, the City of San Jose \n9  (“San Jose”) has been able to hire these DACA recipients, which has benefited the cities and \n10  their residents.   \n11  2.  During the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric about immigration became nasty.  \n12  One of the candidates who made extremely outrageous and false statements about immigrants \n13  was defendant Donald J. Trump as he ran for the office of President.  After he was elected and \n14  sworn into office, President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric continued.  Both he and senior \n15  members of this administration have made anti-immigrant statements. \n16  3.  Yet, throughout the campaign and President Trump’s presidency, he has made \n17  positive and reassuring comments about DACA and the DREAMers.  On April 24, 2017 in an \n18  interview with the Associated Press, for example, President Trump told undocumented \n19  immigrants who were brought to the United States as children that they could rest easy. \n20  AP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don't want \n21  to give them the wrong message with this. \n22  TRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give \n23  you that. The dreamers should rest easy.... \n24  4.  President Trump’s stated opinion is shared by most Americans.  Since the United \n25  States is a land of immigrants, most Americans realize the importance of immigrants to this \n26  country. \n27  5.  Despite President Trump’s promises to DREAMers, he broke his promise.  He \n28  directed his Attorney General to make an announcement on September 5, 2017, that DACA \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   1 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 4 of 31\n \n1  would be rescinded, Exhibit 2 and then Defendant Elaine C. Duke (“Secretary Duke”) as the \n2  Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a memorandum that rescinded \n3  DACA, although it deferred rescission for six months.  Exhibit 3.  Secretary Duke’s \n4  memorandum, contrary to law, was issued without providing notice of the change and an \n5  opportunity to be heard.  The reasons for the issuance were contrary to the facts, and arbitrary \n6  and capricious.   \n7  6.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, the lives of the DACA recipients, over a \n8  quarter of whom live in California, have been sent into upheaval.  Fear and uncertainty have \n9  invaded their lives.  Not only have they been injured, but so too has San Jose.   \n10  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11  7.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. This Court has \n12  further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 et \n13  seq. \n14  8.  Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because Plaintiff, \n15  the City of San Jose, is a public entity in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events \n16  or omissions giving rise to this action will occur or have occurred in this District. 28 U.S.C. § \n17  1391(e). \n18  III.  PARTIES \n19  A.   Plaintiff \n20  9.  Plaintiff San Jose is a municipal corporation, organized as a Charter City under \n21  the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California and is located in the County of \n22  Santa Clara.  It is the tenth largest city in the United States.  San Jose has always been a place \n23  for immigrants with almost 40% of its current population having been born in another country.  \n24  San Jose, which had been home to the Ohlone Indians for hundreds of years, was founded by \n25  Spain on November 29, 1777, as El Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe.  In 1821, San Jose \n26  became part of Mexico.  After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded California to the United \n27  States at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, San Jose became its first incorporated \n28  U.S. city.   \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   2 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 5 of 31\n \n1  10.  San Jose is bringing this action on its own behalf and on the behalf of its \n2  employees who are DACA recipients.  As described below, San Jose has suffered its own injury \n3  in fact.  It also has third party standing to bring this action on behalf of its employees because \n4  San Jose has a concrete interest in the outcome of the dispute; San Jose has a close relationship \n5  with its employees, whose rights it is asserting, and there is a hindrance to the employees to \n6  protect their own interests.  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-11, (1991); Singleton v. Wulff, \n7  428 U.S. 106, 113-16 (1976); Wedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, \n8  62 (9th Cir. 1994).  Where here, San Jose is asserting the same right, to allow DACA recipient \n9  employees to have the right to legally work for San Jose, San Jose’s and its employees rights are \n10  inextricably bound up, which satisfies the requirement that San Jose’s interest is sufficiently \n11  aligned with that of its employees.  Viceroy Gold Corp. v. Aubry, 75 F.3d 482, 488-89 (9th Cir. \n12  1996).  The fact that the employees are undocumented immigrants with fear of provoking the \n13  attention of the immigration authorities or creating other legal risks satisfies the requirement that \n14  there is a hindrance to San Jose’s employees protecting their own interests, especially in light of \n15  Defendants’ demonstrated hostility to them.  Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 \n16  F.3d 1027, 1044 (11th Cir. 2008). \n17  B.   Defendants \n18  11.  Defendant Donald J. Trump has been since January 20, 2017, the President of \n19  the United States.  He is sued in his official capacity.  As a candidate, he railed against \n20  immigrants.  When he announced his candidacy in June 2015, for example, he stated: “The U.S. \n21  has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.  Thank you.  It’s true, and these \n22  are the best and the finest.  When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.  \n23  They’re not sending you.  They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of \n24  problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us.  They’re bringing drugs.  They’re bringing \n25  crime.  They’re rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.”  There was no factual support \n26  for this statement.  Despite his animus towards immigrants, he has consistently indicated his \n27  support for DACA, including tweeting on September 7, 2017, after DACA was rescinded, that \n28 \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   3 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 6 of 31\n \n1  “For all those (DACA) that are concerned about status during the 6 month period, you have \n2  nothing to worry about – No action!” \n3  12.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the acting Secretary of the Department of \n4  Homeland Security, a cabinet department of the United States government with the primary \n5  mission of securing borders of the United States.  Acting Secretary Duke issued the \n6  memorandum rescinding DACA, and she and the Department of Homeland Security are \n7  responsible for implementing the rescission of DACA. \n8  13.  Defendant United States of America is sued under 28 U.S.C. § 1346. \n9  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n10  14.  The Statue of Liberty has stood as a welcoming beacon of hope and inspiration to \n11  the millions of immigrants who have come to the United States through New York.  Inscribed on \n12  the statue are the stirring words of Emma Lazarus to: “Give me your tired, your poor, your \n13  huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”   \n14  15.  The reality has been far different than the Statue of Liberty’s inscription as some \n15  groups in the United States have, throughout the nation’s history, tried to limit citizenship to \n16  groups of people some found undesirable:  Irish, Italians, Jews, Chinese, Mexicans and the list \n17  goes on.  Yet, most of the immigrants who have come to the United States simply want to make \n18  a better life for themselves and their families and to fit in to their new country.  Our country \n19  would not be the greatest country in the world without the diversity of its citizenship achieved \n20  through immigration.   \n21  A.  Immigrants Contribute to the Success of the United States and California \nCities \n22 \n23  16.  Studies demonstrate the positive impact immigrants, even undocumented \n24  immigrants, have on the United States.  In April of 2016, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n25  published a report entitled Immigration Myths and Faces, \n26  www.uschamber.com/reports/immigration-myths.  The report demonstrates that most common \n27  negative contentions regarding immigrants are false.  For example, with citation to evidence, the \n28  Chamber of Commerce demonstrates that immigrants do not take away jobs from U.S. citizens, \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   4 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 7 of 31\n \n1  do not drive down the wages of the U.S. workers, but to the contrary, immigrants are necessary \n2  for the U.S. economy.  The Chamber also demonstrates that immigrants, even undocumented \n3  immigrants, pay taxes.  Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefit \n4  programs like Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and food stamps.  The Chamber report \n5  demonstrates that undocumented immigrants do not commit more crime than citizens.  FBI data \n6  demonstrates that as the number of undocumented immigrants tripled from 1990, violent crime \n7  declined 48% and property crime declined 41%.  A report from the conservative Americas \n8  Majority Foundation found that crime rates are lowest in states with the highest immigration \n9  growth rates.  Immigrants are less likely than people born in the United States to commit crimes \n10  or be incarcerated.   \n11  17.  San Jose has been an extremely diverse region since the mid-1800s, which has \n12  led to immigrants gravitating to such areas where there are already established immigrant \n13  communities.  Waves of immigrants, from China and Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Northern \n14  Europe, have played a fundamental role in the creation of three profoundly different industries: \n15  first mining, then agriculture, and finally technology in San Jose and the Silicon Valley.  \n16  http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19862.   \n17  B.  In 2012, DACA Is Implemented \n18  18.  Throughout the later part of the last century and the first part of this century, \n19  politicians could not agree on a comprehensive immigration policy.  Immigrants who would \n20  have had a clear path to citizenship in the past found citizenship almost impossible to achieve.  \n21  Yet, immigrants who had no hope in their country of birth came to the United States without \n22  documentation for a better life.  In the process, they have enriched our country.  Many of these \n23  immigrants brought their entire families, including their young children. \n24  19.  By 2012, there were millions of residents who came here as children, but they did \n25  not have documentation to remain in this country.  As Congress stalled in enacting any \n26  meaningful immigration reform, there was a groundswell to protect these young people from \n27  deportation and allow them to live productive lives to enrich themselves, their families and their \n28  adopted country. \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   5 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 8 of 31\n \n1  20.  In June of 2012, President Barack Obama, through an Executive Order, enacted \n2  DACA.  He stated that he believed it was “the right thing to do” to protect young people who do \n3  not know any country but America.  On June 15, 2012, then Secretary of Homeland Security \n4  Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program.  Exhibit 1.  DACA is \n5  in essence a deferred prosecution agreement. \n6  21.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established that an applicant would be \n7  considered for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion only by satisfying each of the following \n8  criteria: \n9    came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n10    had continuously resided in the United States for at least five years \n11  preceding the date of the memorandum and is present in the United States \n12  on the date of the memorandum; \n13    was currently in school, had graduated from high school, had obtained a \n14  general education development certificate, or was an honorably \n15  discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United \n16  States; \n17    had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor \n18  offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to \n19  national security or public safety; and \n20    was not above the age of thirty. \n21  22.  In addition to simply being eligible for this program, undocumented immigrants \n22  must also pay a $495 application fee, submit several forms, and produce documents showing \n23  they meet the requirements.  Moreover, if a DACA qualifying immigrant wants to travel abroad \n24  there is an additional fee and application requirement required.  Those applying are also vetted \n25  for any criminal history or threat to national security and must be students or have completed \n26  school or military service.  If approved, action to deport them is deferred for two years, along \n27  with the opportunity to renew, along with gaining eligibility for basics like a driving license, \n28  college enrollment or a work permit. \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   6 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 9 of 31\n \n1  23.  In exchange for DACA applicants providing sensitive and private information \n2  regarding their entire lives, the United States government promised to keep the information \n3  confidential and not to use it, except in limited circumstances, for any purposes except for \n4  DACA purposes.   \n \n5 \nC.  DACA Has Provided 800,000 Young People Who Have Known No Other \n6  Country than the United States a Chance to Attend College and/or Work \n7  24.  The rewards of DACA have been enormous, not only to the immigrants who \n8  came to this country as children, but to the nation.  First-generation immigrants who enter the \n9  United States as children tend to pay, on average, more in taxes over their lifetimes than they \n10  receive in benefits, regardless of their education level.  DACA recipients end up contributing \n11  more than the average, because they are not eligible for any federal means-tested welfare: cash \n12  assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, health-care tax credits or anything else.   \n13  25.  Moreover, DACA recipients also are better educated than the average immigrant. \n14  Applicants must have at least a high school degree to enter the program.  An additional 36 \n15  percent of DACA recipients who are older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree, and an additional \n16  32 percent are pursuing a bachelor’s degree. \n17  26.  Further, while studies show that undocumented immigrants are much less likely \n18  to end up in prison, this fact is especially true for DACA recipients since applicants must also \n19  pass a background check, indicating even lower levels of criminal behavior than the average \n20  American citizen.   \n21  27.  DACA has been a success as it has allowed over 800,000 recipients to work and \n22  go to college in the United States thus enriching our economy and security.   \n23  D.  San Jose and Silicon Valley Have Benefitted From DACA \n24  28.  For San Jose, the ability to hire DACA recipients has been extremely beneficial.  \n25  San Jose, like the rest of the Silicon Valley, has the need for a skilled work force.  \n26  Unemployment in Santa Clara County is low and competition for employees is fierce.  When \n27  DACA was enacted, San Jose was able to hire DACA grantees.  San Jose spent time and \n28  resources training these employees and they hold jobs vital to the operation of San Jose.   \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   7 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 10 of 31\n \n1  29.  San Jose is also home to tech companies, like Cisco and Adobe, who need skilled \n2  workers.  These companies also hired DACA recipients as did other Silicon Valley companies, \n3  like Apple, Facebook, and Google, and many employees live in San Jose.   \n4  E.  While President Trump Has Been Ant-Immigrant, He Has Been Supportive \nof DACA Recipients \n5 \n1.  Anti-Immigrant Statements by the President and His Administration \n6 \n7  30.  Donald Trump during his campaign for President and since becoming President \n8  has demonstrated an animus to immigrants.  His administration, especially people in the \n9  Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, has been just as anti-immigrant as \n10  the President.  Their statements demonstrate this discrimination. \n11  31.  Candidate Trump’s statements against immigrants were bombastic and incorrect.   \n12  For example, Trump repeatedly denigrated Mexican immigrants in particular, even comparing \n13  them to rapists in his presidential bid announcement “When Mexico send its people, they’re not \n14  sending their best. They’re not sending you.  They’re not sending you.  They’re sending people \n15  that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us.  They’re bringing drugs.  \n16  They’re bringing crime.  They’re rapists.  And some, I assume are good people.” \n17  (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-\n18  announces-a-presidential-bid/?utm_term=.f6c79452d595) \n19  32.  During the first Republican presidential debate, candidate Trump doubled down \n20  on his disparaging thoughts about Mexican immigrants, claiming that “The Mexican \n21  government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.  And they send the bad ones \n22  over because they don’t want to pay for them.  They don’t want to take care of them.” \n23  (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-claims-debate-mexico-sends-bad-ones-u-s-\n24  n405661)   \n25  33.  During another presidential debate in October 2016, candidate Trump once again \n26  broadly assaulted immigrant families and communities with his views on immigration by \n27  declaring “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.” \n28 \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   8 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 11 of 31\n \n1  (https:www.cnce.com/2016/10/19/trump-we-have-some-bad-hombres-and-were-going-to-get-\n2  them-out.html) \n3  34.  After becoming President, President Trump’s statements have not become \n4  Presidential, but continue to be bombastic and incorrect.  For example, President Trump again \n5  negatively referred to Mexicans as ‘hombres’ in a phone call with Mexico’s President, \n6  condemning these immigrants by saying “You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that \n7  you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league.  But they have to \n8  be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out.” \n9  (http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/best-lines-trump-mexico-australia-call/index.html) \n10  35.  President Trump and his administration further clarified their stance on \n11  immigration, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Thomas Homan \n12  testified that “every immigrant in this country without papers should be uncomfortable.  You \n13  should look over your shoulder.  And you need to be worried.”  These sentiments were once \n14  again repeated in an interview later that week, when Homan stated that “Trump and his \n15  administration have made clear that any undocumented immigrant could be arrested and face \n16  deportation proceedings at any time, unless they have current and valid protection under \n17  DACA.”  (http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/politics/ice-immigrants-should-be-afraid-\n18  homan/index.html) \n19  36.  United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions further reiterated these sentiments \n20  coming from the Trump administration as he responded to immigration on Fox News in April \n21  2017 by stating “Everybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come \n22  here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not subject to being \n23  deported – well, they are.  The policy is that if people are here unlawfully, they’re subject to \n24  being deported.  Our priority is clear… we can’t promise people who are here unlawfully that \n25  they’re not going to be deported.” (http://www.foxnews.com/polticis/2017/04/19/sessions-\n26  defends-immigration-policies-after-reported-dreamer-deportation.html). \n27   \n28   \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   9 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 12 of 31\n \n1  2.  Despite His Anti-Immigration Rhetoric, Trump Has Demonstrated \nHis Support of DACA \n2 \n3  37.  Even as he has railed at immigrants, President Trump has repeatedly stated his \n4  support for DACA recipients.  For example, in an interview with TIME magazine on the \n5  campaign trail in December 2016, President Trump signaled that he could find a way to \n6  accommodate the DREAMers “We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people \n7  happy and proud.  They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve \n8  gone to school here.  Some were good students.  Some have wonderful jobs.  And they’re in \n9  never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.” (http://time.com/time-\n10  person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump/?iid=buttonrecirc) \n11  38.  President Trump made statements in an interview with Fox & Friends on January \n12  18, 2017, promising “It’s a plan that’s going to be very firm, but it’s going to have a lot of heart.  \n13  And we’re going to be looking into that situation…. That’s a very tough situation, but I think \n14  they’re going to end up being very happy.” (http://wwwpolitico.com/story/2017/01/trump-\n15  immigration-plan-233748) \n16  39.  President Trump reiterated this position the next week in an interview with David \n17  Muir of ABC News, claiming that “[DACA grantees] shouldn’t be very worried.  I do have a big \n18  heart.  We’re going to take care of everybody.” (http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-\n19  news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-president/story?id=45047602) \n20  40.  At a press conference in February of 2017, President Trump announced “We’re \n21  going to show great heart… you have some absolutely incredible kids – I would say mostly.  \n22  They were brought here in such a way.  It’s a very – it’s a very very tough subject.  We are \n23  going to deal with DACA with heart.  I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget.  And I \n24  have to convince them that what I’m saying is, is right… But the DACA situation is a very very \n25  – it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids.  I love kids.  I have kids \n26  and grandkids and I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.” \n27  (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-\n28  conference) \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   10 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 13 of 31\n \n1  41.  In an Associated Press interview in April of 2017, President Trump said his \n2  administration is “not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals” and that “The dreamers \n3  should rest easy” since his Administration’s policy is not to deport DACA grantees. \n4  (https//apnews.com/79f2c79805f14c3f8ac878c5df21cdfd/Trump-tells-‘dreamers’-to-rest-\n5  easy,%20-targets-criminaks) \n6  42.  Even in a written statement issued shortly after the Attorney General, Jeff \n7  Sessions, announced the policy to terminate DACA, President Trump declared “I do not favor \n8  punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents.  But we must \n9  also recognize that we are [a] nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.” \n10  (http://deadline.com/2017/09/donald-trump-daca-statement-punishing-children-1202161542/) \n11  43.  In addition to his written statement after Secretary Sessions’ announcement \n12  terminating DACA, President Trump also tweeted that he “will revisit this issue!” if DACA was \n13  not legalized by Congress in the allotted 6 month time span. (https://twitter.com/real Donald \n14  Trump) \n15  F.  The Rescission of DACA \n16  44.  On September 5, 2017, President Trump, through Attorney General Sessions \n17  announced the rescission of DACA.  Exhibit 2.  On the same day, Elaine Duke, the Acting \n18  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a memorandum rescinding DACA.  \n19  Exhibit 3.  The memo was issued without compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act.  \n20  There was no notification that there was going to be a change in DACA, no notice to be heard, \n21  and no factual findings or analysis to demonstrate that DACA should be rescinded. \n22  G.  San Jose Has Taken Action to Try to Help Its Immigrant Residents, But Has \nLimited Ability to Effectuate Change, Except With this Lawsuit \n23 \n24  45.  When Donald Trump was elected President, residents of San Jose were \n25  concerned about the President-elect’s immigration positions.  In response, in January of 2017, \n26  the City Council, approved a plan proposed by Mayor Sam Liccardo to educate immigrants \n27  about their rights, helping schools with “safety plans,” and allowing churches to provide \n28 \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   11 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 14 of 31\n \n1  sanctuary to undocumented residents if needed.  The plan also created “safe spaces” in city-\n2  owned facilities, such as libraries, to provide pro-bono legal services.   \n3  46.  In response to the Defendants’ rescission of DACA, San Jose confirmed its \n4  support of its immigrant residents and DACA recipients specifically.  Mayor Sam Liccardo, for \n5  example, issued the following statement: \n \n6 \nThe Attorney Generals announcement of the Trump Administration's rescission \nof DACA abandons 800,000 of America's hardest-working, most patriotic residents. \n7 \nPunting the issue to Congress, without any affirmative leadership to enact a legislative \n8  solution, amounts to a cowardly cop-out, placing the futures of these young women and \nmen in serious jeopardy. \n9   \nTo San Jose's tens of thousands of DREAMers, we reiterate: “We've got your \n10 \nback.” I will seek to challenge the Administration's actions in court, after consulting with \nour Council and City Attorney regarding our options in the week ahead. \n11 \n \n12  History will not forgive Donald Trump for abandoning our DREAMers. \n13  47.  Santa Clara County Board of Supervisor’s Chair Dave Cortese stated:  “Trump’s \n14  plan to eliminate DACA is by far his most callous attempt as of yet. The lives, dreams, and \n15  futures of thousands of DACA recipients are not a bargaining chip for this Administration to \n16  play with. I remain committed to them and to their cause.  I urge every DREAMer out there to \n17  remain resilient and hopeful.  Because together, we will rise.”   \n18  48.  The Silicon Valley Organization, stated through its Executive Vice President:  \n19  \"Not only is the rollback of DACA immoral, but it is also terrible for America's competitive \n20  economic advantage.  Our economic strength is our diversity; it is our greatest asset and our key \n21  difference maker.  To put 800,000 Americans, whose sole 'infraction' was arriving here as \n22  children, on a path to lose citizenship will upend a large portion of this key strength.  Rescinding \n23  DACA sends the message that America's door to opportunity is slammed tighter, and that is not \n24  the message that Silicon Valley business leaders want our government to send to the world at a \n25  time when expanding opportunity is the key to long-term innovative success.\" \n26  H.  The Rescission of DACA Has Harmed San Jose \n27  49.  The rescission of DACA has already had and will continue to have an impact, not \n28  only on the lives of the DACA recipients, but on San Jose who has suffered a concrete and \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   12 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 15 of 31\n \n1  specific injury by the rescission.  Based upon the rescission of DACA, San Jose has had to take \n2  steps to deal with the fact that starting on March 5, 2018, the date that the DACA rescission goes \n3  into effect, it will lose employees, who are DACA recipients.  In order for an employer to hire \n4  an employee, the employer must confirm that the employee has the legal right to work in the \n5  United States.  See 8 C.F.R. § 274A.1 et seq.  Cities who employ people without the right to \n6  work face steep penalties and criminal penalties.  However, it is also illegal for the cities to \n7  terminate employees because of their nationality or immigration status.  Thus San Jose is facing \n8  the uncertainty of not knowing whether they will be able to continue to retain these valuable \n9  employees in their work force.  With the rescission of DACA, the DACA recipients will be \n10  losing their right to work for San Jose.  In order for San Jose to end the employment relationship \n11  with an employee and to make sure that there is a smooth transition without the loss of city \n12  services, San Jose must start planning now.  Accordingly, even though the DACA rescission \n13  allows DACA recipients to work until March 5, 2018, San Jose has not been able to wait until \n14  then to make plans to have this change in work force. It has expended and will continue to \n15  extend time and resources to react to this loss of experienced employees. \n16  50.  The acts of Defendants have decreased the efficiency of the work performed by \n17  San Jose.  The impact of the DACA rescission on DACA recipients has been catastrophic as \n18  they face a future of uncertainty and fear.  San Jose has had to expend time and resources to deal \n19  with the loss of productivity and employee morale because of the rescission of DACA, which is \n20  another injury.  FPL Food, LLC v. United States Dep't of Agric., 671 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1358 \n21  (S.D. Ga. 2009).     \n22  51.  Additionally, because of the taxes that DACA recipients pay, San Jose is facing \n23  the loss of tax revenues.  It has had to start expending time and resources to deal with this loss of \n24  funds. \n25   \n26   \n27  /// \n28  /// \nLaw Offices  \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF   13 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 16 of 31\n \n1  V.

As set forth above, Defendants’ actions target individuals for discriminatory \n10  treatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification.  Defendants’ actions were \n11  motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory intent to harm a particular group and treat them \n12  differently under the law.   \n13  55.  Defendants’ discriminatory actions cannot be sufficiently justified by federal \n14  interests.  \n15  56.  Through their actions as set forth above, Defendants have violated the equal \n16  protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  \n17  57.  Defendants' actions has caused and continues to cause ongoing harm to San Jose \n18  including their DACA employees, as hereinbefore described. \n19  58.

DACCA is a federal rule and therefore, before rescinding DACA, Defendants \n2  were required to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires that federal \n3  agencies go through a process of notice and comment before repealing any substantive rule.   \n4  5 U.S.C. § 553. \n5  61.  By rescinding DACA without providing proper notice and an opportunity to \n6  comment, Defendants have violated 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) because the rescission was done \n7  without proper observance of the procedure of law.    \n8  62.  Even if Defendants believed that DACA itself was defective for not complying \n9  with the Administrative Procedure Act, which it was not, Defendants were required to comply \n10  with the Administrative Procedure Act.

Aguilar \nActing Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nAlejandro Mayorkas \nDirector, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \nJohn Morton \nDirector, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n/J  ~ \nJ--\nFROM: \t Janet Napolitano  {/ \n1 \nSecretary ofHomeJJ/ntr8'ecurfty / \nSUBJECT: \t Exercising Proset¢orial Discretion with Respect to Individuals \nWho Came to thei.Jnited States as Children \nBy this memorandum, I am setting forth how, in the exercise of our prosecutorial discretion, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) should enforce the Nation's immigration laws against \ncertain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \nhome.  As a general matter, these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law and our ongoing \nreview ofpending removal cases is already offering administrative closure to many of them. \nHowever, additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are not \nexpended on these low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet \nour enforcement priorities. \nThe following criteria should be satisfied before an individual is considered for an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion pursuant to this memorandum: \n• \t came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n• \t has continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding the date of \nthis memorandum and is present in the United States on the date ofthis memorandum; \n• \t is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education \ndevelopment certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or \nArmed Forces ofthe United States; \n• \t has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple \nmisdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; \nand \n• \t is not above the age of thirty. \nwww.dhs.gov \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 21 of 31\nOur Nation' s immigration laws must be enforced in a strong and sensible manner.  They are not \ndesigned to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of \neach case.  Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they \nmay not have lived or even speak the language.  Indeed, many of these young people have \nalready contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in \nso many other areas, is especially justified here. \nAs part of this exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the above criteria are to be considered \nwhether or not an individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of \nremoval.  No individual should receive deferred action under this memorandum unless they first \npass a background check and requests for relief pursuant to this memorandum are to be decided \non a case by case basis.  DHS cannot provide any assurance that relief will be granted in all \ncases. \n1.  With respect to individuals who are encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS): \n• \t With respect to individuals who meet the above criteria, ICE and CBP should \nimmediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis, in order to prevent low \npriority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings or removed from the \nUnited States. \n• \t USCIS is instructed to implement this memorandum consistent with its existing guidance \nregarding the issuance of notices to appear. \n2.  With respect to individuals who are in removal proceedings but not yet subject to a final order \nof removal, and who meet the above criteria: \n• \t ICE should exercise prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis, for individuals who \nmeet the above criteria by deferring action for a period of two years, subject to renewal, \nin order to prevent low priority individuals from being removed from the United States. \n• \t ICE is instructed to use its Office of the Public Advocate to permit individuals who \nbelieve they meet the above criteria to identify themselves through a clear and efficient \nprocess. \n• \t ICE is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this \nmemorandum. \n• \t ICE is also instructed to immediately begin the process of deferring action against \nindividuals who meet the above criteria whose cases have already been identified through \nthe ongoing review of pending cases before the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview. \n3.  With respect to the individuals who are not currently in removal proceedings and meet the \nabove criteria, and pass a background check: \n• \t USCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial \ndiscretion, on an individual basis, by deferring action against individuals who meet the \n2 \n\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 22 of 31\nabove criteria and are at least 15 years old, for a period oftwo years, subject to renewal, \nin order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings \nor removed from the United States. \n• \t The USCIS process shall also be available to individuals subject to a final order of \nremoval regardless of their age. \n• \t US CIS is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days ofthe date ofthis \nmemorandum. \nFor individuals who are granted deferred action by either ICE or USCIS, USCIS shall accept \napplications to determine whether these individuals qualify for work authorization during this \nperiod of deferred action. \nThis memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. \nOnly the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for \nthe executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise ofdiscretion within the \nframework of the existing law.  I have done so here. \n~jJz~ \n3 \n\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 23 of 31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit 2\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 24 of 31\nU.S. DOJ Seal\n Office of the Attorney General\nWashington, D.C. 20530 \nDear Acting Secretary Duke, \nI write to advise that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should rescind the \nJune 15 2012, DHS Memorandum entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \n9\nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children,\" as well as any related memoranda or \nguidance.  This policy, known as \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" (DACA), allows \ncertain individuals who are without lawful status in the United States to request and receive a \nrenewable, two-year presumptive reprieve from removal, and other benefits such as work \nauthorization and participation in the Social Security program. \nDACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without \nproper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.  Such an open-ended \ncircumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the \nExecutive Branch.  The related Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful  Permanent \nResidents (DAPA) policy was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth \nCircuit on the basis of multiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally \ndivided vote.  See Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 669-70 (S.D. Tex.), affd,  809 F.3d \n134,  171-86 (5th Cir. 2015), affd  by equally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016). Then-\nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly rescinded the DAPA policy in June.  Because the \nDACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to \nDAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to \nDACA. \nIn light of the costs and burdens that will be imposed on DHS associated with rescinding \nthis policy, DHS  should consider an orderly and efficient wind-down process. \nAs Attorney General of the United States, I have a duty to defend the Constitution and to \nfaithfully execute the laws passed by Congress.  Proper enforcement  of our immigration laws is, \nas President Trump consistently said, critical to the national interest and to the restoration of the \nrule of law in our country.  The Department of Justice stands ready to assist and to continue to \nsupport DHS in these important  efforts. \nSincerely \nJefferson  B.

For the reasons and in the manner outlined below, Department of Homeland\nSecurity personnel shall take all appropriate actions to execute a wind-down of the program,\nconsistent with the parameters established in this memorandum.\nBackground\nThe Department of Homeland Security established DACA through the issuance of a\nmemorandum on June 15, 2012. The program purported to use deferred action—an act of\nprosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis—to\nconfer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by\nlaw.[1] (#_ftn1) Specifically, DACA provided certain illegal aliens who entered the United States\nbefore the age of sixteen a period of deferred action and eligibility to request employment\nauthorization.\nOn November 20, 2014, the Department issued a new memorandum, expanding the\nparameters of DACA and creating a new policy called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans\nand Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”). Among other things—such as the expansion of the\ncoverage criteria under the 2012 DACA policy to encompass aliens with a wider range of ages\nand arrival dates, and lengthening the period of deferred action and work authorization from\ntwo years to three—the November 20, 2014 memorandum directed USCIS “to establish a\nprocess, similar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred\naction, on a case-by-case basis,” to certain aliens who have “a son or daughter who is a U.S.\ncitizen or lawful permanent resident.” \nPrior to the implementation of DAPA, twenty-six states—led by Texas—challenged the policies\nannounced in the November 20, 2014 memorandum in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Texas. In an order issued on February 16, 2015, the district court preliminarily\nenjoined the policies nationwide.[2] (#_ftn2) The district court held that the plaintiff states were\nlikely to succeed on their claim that the DAPA program did not comply with relevant\nauthorities.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Texas and the\nother states had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and satisfied\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 28 of 31\nthe other requirements for a preliminary injunction.[3] (#_ftn3) The Fifth Circuit concluded that\nthe Department’s DAPA policy conflicted with the discretion authorized by Congress. In\nconsidering the DAPA program, the court noted that the Immigration and Nationality Act\n“flatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and\nthereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work\nauthorization.” According to the court, “DAPA is foreclosed by Congress’s careful plan; the\nprogram is ‘manifestly contrary to the statute’ and therefore was properly enjoined.” \nAlthough the original DACA policy was not challenged in the lawsuit, both the district and\nappellate court decisions relied on factual findings about the implementation of the 2012\nDACA memorandum. The Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that DACA decisions were\nnot truly discretionary,[4] (#_ftn4) and that DAPA and expanded DACA would be substantially\nsimilar in execution. Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that\nimplementation of the program did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act\nbecause the Department did not implement it through notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s ruling by equally divided vote (4-4).[5] (#_ftn5)\nThe evenly divided ruling resulted in the Fifth Circuit order being affirmed. The preliminary\ninjunction therefore remains in place today. In October 2016, the Supreme Court denied a\nrequest from DHS to rehear the case upon the appointment of a new Justice. After the 2016\nelection, both parties agreed to a stay in litigation to allow the new administration to review\nthese issues.\nOn January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,768, “Enhancing Public\nSafety in the Interior of the United States.” In that Order, the President directed federal\nagencies to “[e]nsure the faithful execution of the immigration laws . . . against all removable\naliens,” and established new immigration enforcement priorities. On February 20, 2017, then\nSecretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly issued an implementing memorandum, stating\n“the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from\npotential enforcement,” except as provided in the Department’s June 15, 2012 memorandum\nestablishing DACA,[6] (#_ftn6) and the November 20, 2014 memorandum establishing DAPA and\nexpanding DACA.[7] (#_ftn7)\nOn June 15, 2017, after consulting with the Attorney General, and considering the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of the ongoing litigation, then Secretary John F. Kelly issued a\nmemorandum rescinding DAPA and the expansion of DACA—but temporarily left in place the\nJune 15, 2012 memorandum that initially created the DACA program.\nThen, on June 29, 2017, Texas, along with several other states, sent a letter to Attorney\nGeneral Sessions asserting that the original 2012 DACA memorandum is unlawful for the same\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 29 of 31\nreasons stated in the Fifth Circuit and district court opinions regarding DAPA and expanded\nDACA. The letter notes that if DHS does not rescind the DACA memo by September 5, 2017, the\nStates will seek to amend the DAPA lawsuit to include a challenge to DACA.\nThe Attorney General sent a letter to the Department on September 4, 2017, articulating his\nlegal determination that DACA “was effectuated by the previous administration through\nexecutive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after\nCongress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar\nresult. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional\nexercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” The letter further stated that because DACA\n“has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is\nlikely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.”\nNevertheless, in light of the administrative complexities associated with ending the program,\nhe recommended that the Department wind it down in an efficient and orderly fashion, and\nhis office has reviewed the terms on which our Department will do so.\nRescission of the June 15, 2012 DACA Memorandum\nTaking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing\nlitigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June\n15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated. In the exercise of my authority in establishing\nnational immigration policies and priorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified\nbelow, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 memorandum.\nRecognizing the complexities associated with winding down the program, the Department will\nprovide a limited window in which it will adjudicate certain requests for DACA and associated\napplications meeting certain parameters specified below. Accordingly, effective immediately,\nthe Department:\nWill adjudicate—on an individual, case-by-case basis—properly filed pending DACA\ninitial requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents\nthat have been accepted by the Department as of the date of this memorandum.\nWill reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for Employment\nAuthorization Documents filed after the date of this memorandum.\nWill adjudicate—on an individual, case by case basis—properly filed pending DACA\nrenewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization\nDocuments from current beneficiaries that have been accepted by the Department as\nof the date of this memorandum, and from current beneficiaries whose benefits will\nexpire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been\naccepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   Page 30 of 31\nWill reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment\nAuthorization Documents filed outside of the parameters specified above.\nWill not terminate the grants of previously issued deferred action or revoke\nEmployment Authorization Documents solely based on the directives in this\nmemorandum for the remaining duration of their validity periods.\nWill not approve any new Form I-131 applications for advance parole under\nstandards associated with the DACA program, although it will generally honor the\nstated validity period for previously approved applications for advance parole.\nNotwithstanding the continued validity of advance parole approvals previously\ngranted, CBP will—of course—retain the authority it has always had and exercised in\ndetermining the admissibility of any person presenting at the border and the eligibility\nof such persons for parole. Further, USCIS will—of course—retain the authority to\nrevoke or terminate an advance parole document at any time.\nWill administratively close all pending Form I-131 applications for advance parole\nfiled under standards associated with the DACA program, and will refund all associated\nfees.\nWill continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny deferred\naction at any time when immigration officials determine termination or denial of\ndeferred action is appropriate.\nThis document is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil,\nor criminal matter. Likewise, no limitations are placed by this guidance on the otherwise\nlawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS.\n[1] (#_ftnref1) Significantly, while the DACA denial notice indicates the decision to deny is made\nin the unreviewable discretion of USCIS, USCIS has not been able to identify specific denial\ncases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic categorical criteria as\noutlined in the June 15, 2012 memorandum, but still had his or her application denied based\nsolely upon discretion.\n[2] (#_ftnref2) Texas v.

For the reasons below, dismissal is DENIED and some provisional relief\n23\nis GRANTED. \n24\nSTATEMENT\n25\nIn 2012, the United States Department of Homeland Security adopted a program to\n26\npostpone deportation of undocumented immigrants brought to America as children and, pending\n27\naction in their cases, to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security\n28\nnumbers, pay taxes, and become part of the mainstream economy.  This program received the\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 2 of 49\n1 title “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” — DACA for short.  In 2017, however, after the\n2 national election and change in administrations, the agency eventually reversed itself and began\n3 a phase-out of DACA.  All agree that a new administration is entitled to replace old policies\n4 with new policies so long as they comply with the law.  One question presented in these related\n5 actions is whether the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather\n6 than in compliance with the law.\n7 1. HISTORY OF DEFERRED ACTION.\n8 At the core of these cases is an administrative practice known as “deferred action.” \n9 A primary question presented concerns the extent to which the Department of Homeland\n10 Security could lawfully use deferred action to implement DACA, and so it is important to review\nt 11 the history of deferred action as well as of other features of the DACA program.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Congress has the constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant thereto, Congress has established a comprehensive scheme governing\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 immigration and naturalization through the Immigration and Nationality Act.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 et seq.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is “charged with the administration and enforcement\nS N 16 of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” \nted  For the  17 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  The Secretary is further charged with “establishing national immigration\ni\nn\nU\n18 enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).   \n19 One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., deportation.  In turn,\n20 “[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration\n21 officials.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).  As an initial matter, in any given\n22 case, immigration officials “must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Ibid. \n23 At each stage of the removal process, they have “discretion to abandon the endeavor.”  Reno v.\n24 Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”).  \n25 Beginning as early as 1975, one way to exercise this discretion became “deferred action.” \n26 By deferred action, immigration officials could postpone, seemingly indefinitely, the removal of\n27 individuals unlawfully present in the United States “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the\n28\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 3 of 49\n1 Executive’s] own convenience.”  Id. at 483–84.  Immigration officials could also grant parole,\n2 temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure.  \n3 Some of these discretionary powers have flowed from statute.  Parole, for example,\n4 has allowed otherwise inadmissible aliens to temporarily enter the United States “for urgent\n5 humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Temporary\n6 protected status, also created by statute, has been available to nationals of designated foreign\n7 states affected by armed conflicts, environmental disasters, and other extraordinary conditions. \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  \n9 Some of these discretionary powers, however, have flowed from nonstatutory powers. \n10 Deferred enforced departure had no statutory basis but, instead, grew out of “the President’s\nt 11 constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations.”  USCIS, Adjudicator’s Field Manual\nr\nu\no a 12 § 38.2(a) (2014).  Nor has extended voluntary departure been anchored in any statute.  Rather,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 it has been recognized as part of the discretion of the Attorney General.  Hotel & Restaurant\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Employees Union, Local 25 v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc).  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Deferred action, originally known as “nonpriority” status, also began “without express\nS N 16 statutory authorization” but has since been recognized by the Supreme Court as a “regular\nted  For the  17 practice.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action by explicit\ni\nn\nU\n18 reference to it in the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2)):\n19 The denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under\nthis subsection shall not preclude the alien from applying for a stay\n20 of removal, deferred action, or a continuance or abeyance of\nremoval proceedings under any other provision of the immigration\n21 laws of the United States.\n22 Another federal statute, the REAL ID Act, also acknowledged deferred action.  REAL ID\n23 Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231.  This law provided that states could issue\n24 a temporary driver’s license or identification card to persons who can demonstrate an\n25 “authorized stay in the United States.”  Id. §§ 202(c)(2)(C)(i)–(ii).  Persons with “approved\n26 deferred action status” were expressly identified as being present in the United States during a\n27 “period of authorized stay,” for the purpose of issuing state identification cards.  Id. §§\n28 202(c)(2)(B)(viii), (C)(ii).  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 4 of 49\n1 Congress has also given the Executive Branch broad discretion to determine when\n2 noncitizens may work in the United States.  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053,\n3 1062 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Brewer I”); see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (defining an “unauthorized alien”\n4 not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident\n5 nor “authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security]”). \n6 Pursuant to this statutory authority, regulations promulgated in the 1980s allowed recipients of\n7 deferred action to apply for work authorization if they could demonstrate an “economic necessity\n8 for employment.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  \n9 The George W. Bush Administration began to use deferred action to mitigate a harsh\n10 statutory provision involving “unlawful presence.”  The Illegal Immigration Reform and\nt 11 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 created three- and ten-year bars on the admission of\nr\nu\no a 12 aliens who departed or were removed from the United States after periods of “unlawful\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 presence” of between 180 days and one year, or more than one year, respectively.  8 U.S.C.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).

DHS excluded recipients\n23 of deferred action from being “unlawfully present” because their deferred action is a period of\n24 stay authorized by the government.  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059 (citing 8 U.S.C.\n25 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii)).  This nonaccrual practice arose well before DACA.1  \n26\n27\n1  Undocumented aliens do not begin to accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of\n28\nSection 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) until they reach the age of eighteen.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii).\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 5 of 49\n1 DACA grew out of a long agency history of discretionary relief programs.  In 1956, the\n2 Eisenhower Administration paroled roughly one thousand foreign-born orphans who had been\n3 adopted by American citizens but were precluded from entering the United States because of\n4 statutory quotas.  That same administration later granted parole to tens of thousands of\n5 Hungarian refugees after the unsuccessful Hungarian revolution.  Both programs flowed from\n6 presidential statements, and the programs later ended (in 1959 and 1958, respectively) when\n7 Congress passed laws enabling the paroled individuals to become lawful permanent residents\n8 (App. 1602–03, 1948–57; AR 33).2 \n9 In 1987, President Ronald Reagan instituted the Family Fairness Program, a non-\n10 statutory program that provided extended voluntary departure to children whose parents were in\nt 11 the process of legalizing their immigration status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nr\nu\no a 12 of 1986.  President George H.W. Bush extended the non-statutory program in 1990 to cover\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 spouses of such legalized aliens, and the program ultimately provided immigration relief to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 approximately 1.5 million people.  The need for the program ended with the passage of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration Act of 1990 (App. 1607, 1612–13, 1703).\nS N 16 On at least four occasions prior to the creation of DACA, immigration officials have\nted  For the  17 extended deferred action programs to certain classes of aliens, none of which programs was\ni\nn\nU\n18 expressly authorized by statute:  \n19 • In 1997, INS established a deferred action program for individuals\n20 self-petitioning for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of\n21 1994.  This program is still in place today.  As originally enacted, the\n22 Act did not mention deferred action, but instead provided a pathway\n23 to lawful permanent residency.  Deferred action allowed applicants\n24 to remain in the country pending a decision on their applications. \n25\n26\n2  “App.” refers to the appendix submitted in support of plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief (Dkt.\nNos. 113, 117–19, 121, 124).  In connection with their motion for provisional relief, plaintiffs seek judicial\n27\nnotice of thirty-nine exhibits submitted with the appendix (Dkt. No. 111-2).  The request is unopposed. \nThese exhibits consist of congressional testimony and government publications, memoranda, and press releases. \n28\nPlaintiffs’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED. \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 6 of 49\n1 Congress later expanded the deferred action program in the 2000\n2 VAWA reauthorization legislation (App. at 1640–46).\n3 • In 2002 and 2003, INS issued memoranda instructing officers to make\n4 deferred action assessments for T visa applicants (victims of human\n5 trafficking) and U visa applicants (victims of crimes such as domestic\n6 violence) (App. 1650–58).  These programs have since been codified in\n7 regulations promulgated by INS and DHS. 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(k)(1),\n8 (k)(4), (m)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2).\n9 • After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USCIS announced a deferred action\n10 program for certain foreign students (F-1 visa holders) who, because of\nt 11 the hurricane, could not satisfy the requirements of their student visas. \nr\nu\no a 12 In announcing the program, USCIS stated that “[t]he interim relief\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 [would] remain in effect until February 1, 2006” (App. 1661–62).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • In 2009, to fill a gap under the law, USCIS established a deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action program for widowed spouses who had been married to United\nS N 16 States citizens for less than two years.  Congress later eliminated the\nted  For the  17 statutory requirement that an alien be married to a United States citizen\ni\nn\nU\n18 for at least two years at the time of the citizen’s death to retain\n19 eligibility for lawful immigration status, and USCIS accordingly\n20 withdrew the deferred action program as “obsolete” (App. 1664–82). \n21 In sum, by the time DACA arrived in 2012, deferred action programs had become a\n22 well-accepted feature of the executive’s enforcement of our immigration laws, recognized as\n23 such by Congress and the Supreme Court. \n24 2. DACA.\n25 On June 15, 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a\n26 memorandum establishing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  Under DACA, immigrants\n27 brought to the United States as children could apply for deferred action for a two-year period,\n28 subject to renewal.  To qualify for DACA, an individual must:  (1) have come to the United\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 7 of 49\n1 States before the age of sixteen and been under the age of thirty-one on June 15, 2012;\n2 (2) have been present in the United States on June 15, 2012; (3) have been continuously residing\n3 in the United States for at least the prior five years; (4) have been enrolled in school, graduated\n4 from high school, obtained a GED, or been honorably discharged from the United States military\n5 or Coast Guard; and (5) not pose a threat to national security or public safety (AR 1).\n6 The 2012 DACA memo described the program as an exercise of “prosecutorial\n7 discretion.”  Secretary Napolitano found leniency “especially justified” for the DACA-eligible,\n8 whom she described as “productive young people” who “have already contributed to our country\n9 in significant ways.”  The memo further stated that these individuals “lacked the intent to violate\n10 the law” and were low priority cases for deportation (AR 1–2).\nt 11 DACA applicants had to pass a DHS background check and applications had to be\nr\nu\no a 12 “decided on a case by case basis.”  To apply for DACA, eligible individuals completed USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Form I-821D.  The application called for substantial personal information, such as biographical\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 information, date of entry into the United States, immigration status or lack thereof, educational\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 history, and all prior residential addresses since entering the United States.\nS N 16   Form I-821D also required substantial documentary support, including proof of identity\nted  For the  17 and proof of continuous residence in the United States through rent receipts, utility bills,\ni\nn\nU\n18 employment documents, or similar records.  Applicants also appeared at a USCIS field office\n19 to provide fingerprints, photographs, and signatures.  The form’s instructions stated (App. 1820):\n20 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nto ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the\n21 purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the\nrequestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear\n22 or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to\nAppear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be\n23 shared with national security and law enforcement agencies,\nincluding ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\n24 including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for\nchildhood arrivals request itself, to identify or prevent fraudulent\n25 claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or\nprosecution of a criminal offense.  The above information sharing\n26 clause covers family members and guardians, in addition to the\nrequestor.  \n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 8 of 49\n1 The form’s instructions also stated (App. 1808):\n2 Individuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into\nremoval proceedings or removed from the United States for a\n3 specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.\n4\nDACA applicants also submitted a Form I-765, Application for Employment\n5\nAuthorization, a Form I-765WS, Worksheet, and the accompanying fees.  To determine an\n6\napplicant’s eligibility for work authorization, USCIS reviewed the applicant’s current annual\n7\nincome, current annual expenses, and the total current value of his or her assets (App. 1762,\n8\n1801–21, 2067–87). \n9\nIf approved, the recipient received a Form I-797, Notice of Action, stating (App. 585):\n10\nUSCIS, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, has decided\nt 11 to defer action in your case.  Deferred action is an exercise of\nr\nu prosecutorial discretion by USCIS not to pursue the removal of an\no a 12 individual from the United States for a specific period.  Deferred\nC ni\n  or action does not confer or alter any immigration status.  \nct alif 13  \ni C\ntr of  Significantly, DHS could terminate a recipient’s deferred action at any time, at the\n Dis District  14 agency’s discretion, and DACA paved no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\ntates orthern  15 citizenship (App. 1774, 1808).  Secretary Napolitano concluded her DACA memorandum\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 (AR 1–3):\ni\nn This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status\nU\n18 or pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through its\nlegislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for the\n19 executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of\ndiscretion within the framework of the existing law.  I have done\n20 so here.\n21 But DACA did provide important benefits.  First, under pre-existing regulations, DACA\n22 recipients became eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action,\n23 thereby allowing them to obtain social security numbers and to become legitimate taxpayers and\n24 contributing members of our open economy.  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Second, deferred action\n25 provided a measure of safety for a period of two years from detention and removal, albeit always\n26 subject to termination at any time in any individual case.  Third, DACA recipients could apply\n27 for “advance parole” to obtain permission to travel overseas and be paroled back into the United\n28 States.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f).  Fourth, also pursuant to pre-existing regulations, DACA recipients\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 9 of 49\n1 avoided accrual of time for “unlawful presence” under the INA’s bar on re-entry.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1182(a)(9)(B)–(C) (establishing three-year, ten-year, and permanent bars on the admission\n3 of aliens after specified periods of “unlawful presence”). \n4 USCIS “strongly encourage[d]” DACA recipients to submit renewal requests between\n5 120 and 150 days before the expiration date-stamped on the recipient’s Form I-797.  According\n6 to the “Frequently Asked Questions” posted on the agency’s website, recipients were eligible for\n7 renewal under DACA so long as they:  (1) did not depart the United States on or after August 15,\n8 2012, without advance parole; (2) continuously resided in the United States since submitting\n9 their most recent DACA request; and (3) had not received criminal convictions (with minor\n10 exceptions).  Renewal requests did not require additional documentary support (App. 1756–57).\nt 11 The agency adopted DACA without any notice or opportunity for public comment.\nr\nu\no a 12 According to data published by USCIS, 793,026 applicants received deferred action\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 under DACA since its inception.  As of September 2017, there remained approximately 689,800\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 active DACA recipients.  Their average age was 23.8.  Based on a survey completed by\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Associate Professor Tom K. Wong in August 2017, 91 percent of DACA recipients had jobs,\nS N 16 and 45 percent of DACA recipients were enrolled in school (App. 1494–1522, 1533–52).  \nted  For the  17 3. THE DAPA LITIGATION.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 In 2014, DHS announced a different deferred action program for parents of United States\n19 citizens or lawful permanent residents, titled “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\n20 Lawful Permanent Residents” — shortened to the confusingly-similar acronym DAPA.  \n21 For our purposes, DAPA is important because the United States Court of Appeals for\n22 the Fifth Circuit promptly held that DAPA exceeded the statutory authority of DHS, a holding\n23 that eventually moved Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rule that DACA too had exceeded the\n24 agency’s authority.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). \n25 The 2014 DAPA memo directed USCIS “to establish a process, similar to DACA, for\n26 exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,”\n27 for aliens who had a son or daughter who was a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n28 resident and:  (1) were not an enforcement priority under DHS policy; (2) had continuously\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 10 of 49\n1 resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) had been physically present in the\n2 United States both when DHS announced DAPA and at the time of application to the program;\n3 and (4) presented “no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, [made] the grant of\n4 deferred action inappropriate” (AR 37–41).  \n5 That same 2014 announcement also expanded DACA in three minor ways:  (1) allowing\n6 otherwise eligible immigrants to apply for DACA even if they were older than 31 on the day\n7 DACA was earlier announced; (2) extending DACA renewals and work authorizations from\n8 two- to three-year periods; and (3) adjusting DACA’s date-of-entry requirement from June 15,\n9 2007, to January 1, 2010 (AR 37–41).  \n10 DAPA was also adopted without notice or opportunity for public comment. \nt 11 A coalition of twenty-six states immediately filed suit in the United States District Court\nr\nu\no a 12 for the Southern District of Texas to challenge DAPA.  The district court preliminarily enjoined\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 its implementation on the ground that DHS had failed to comply with the APA’s\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 notice-and-comment requirements.  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The district court’s order stated that “with three minor exceptions,” the case did not involve\nS N 16 DACA (id. at 606):\nted  For the  17 The Complaint in this matter does not include the actions taken by\ni\nn Secretary Napolitano, which have to date formalized the status of\nU\n18 approximately 700,000 teenagers and young adults.  Therefore,\nthose actions are not before the Court and will not be addressed\n19 by this opinion.  Having said that, DACA will necessarily be\ndiscussed in this opinion as it is relevant to many legal issues in\n20 the present case.  For example, the States maintain that the DAPA\napplications will undergo a process identical to that used for\n21 DACA applications and, therefore, DACA’s policies and\nprocedures will be instructive for the Court as to DAPA’s\n22 implementation.\n23 In holding that DAPA violated notice-and-comment procedures, the district court held\n24 that it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the status and employability of\n25 millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal government.”  It therefore should\n26 have been issued, the district court held, after notice and opportunity for public comment.  Id. at\n27 671.  Though the order focused on DAPA, it also preliminarily enjoined everything in the 2014\n28\n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 11 of 49\n1 memorandum, including the three minor ways in which DACA had been modified (but left alone\n2 the 2012 DACA program).  \n3 The Fifth Circuit affirmed in a split decision but added a further ground for affirmance. \n4 Texas, 809 F.3d at 178.  Over a dissent, the appellate panel added the ground that DAPA was\n5 substantively foreclosed by statute because the INA contained “an intricate process for illegal\n6 aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children’s immigration status,”\n7 and that DAPA, by providing “the benefits of lawful presence” to undocumented immigrants\n8 “solely on account of their children’s immigration status,” was inconsistent with this statutory\n9 scheme, which provided its own pathway for lawful presence to parents of children lawfully\n10 in the United States.  Id. at 179–80, 186.  The Fifth Circuit’s holding was also based on its\nt 11 observation that “the INA does not grant the Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and\nr\nu\no a 12 lawful presence on a class-wide basis to 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens.”  Id. at 186\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 n.202.  The decision was later affirmed without opinion by an equally divided Supreme Court. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam).3 \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In February 2017, DHS Secretary John Kelly issued guidance regarding the Trump\nS N 16 Administration’s immigration enforcement priorities.  Although the guidance rescinded “all\nted  For the  17 existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our\ni\nn\nU\n18 immigration laws and priorities for removal,” the 2012 DACA memo and 2014 DAPA memo\n19 were explicitly left in place.  The guidance also said that the 2014 DAPA memo would “be\n20 addressed in future guidance” (AR 229–34).  \n21 In June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded the 2014 DAPA memo, which rescission\n22 included the 2014 expansions of DACA.  He explained: \n23 I have considered a number of factors, including the preliminary\ninjunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA\n24 never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities. \nAfter consulting with the Attorney General, and in the exercise of\n25 my discretion in establishing national immigration enforcement\npolicies and priorities, I hereby rescind the November 20, 2014,\n26 memorandum. \n27\n28\n3  Such an affirmance has no precedential value.  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 192 (1972).  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 12 of 49\n1 Again, however, Secretary Kelly declared that the 2012 DACA memo would remain in effect\n2 (AR 235–37).  \n3 4. RESCISSION OF DACA.    \n4 Also in June 2017, ten of the twenty-six plaintiffs from the DAPA litigation wrote to\n5 Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand rescission of the 2012 DACA memo.  Their letter\n6 stated that if DACA was rescinded by September 5, they would dismiss the still-pending DAPA\n7 litigation.  Otherwise, the letter threatened to try to amend their complaint to additionally\n8 challenge the legality of DACA (AR 238–40).  \n9 A day before the deadline, the Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland\n10 Security Elaine Duke via a short letter that the Obama Administration had created DACA\nt 11 “without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated\nr\nu\no a 12 rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” and that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 therefore the program was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 The Attorney General’s letter also referenced the preliminary injunction against DAPA, then\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 stated that “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the\nS N 16 courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar\nted  For the  17 results with respect to DACA” (AR 251).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 The following day, without prior notice, the Acting Secretary rescinded DACA. \n19 The rescission was not based on any policy criticism.  Instead, it was based on the legal\n20 determination by the Attorney General.  The Acting Secretary explained that after “[t]aking into\n21 consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and\n22 the September 4, 2017, letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012,\n23 DACA program should be terminated.”  She said that “[r]ecognizing the complexities associated\n24 with winding down the program,” DHS would “provide a limited window” in which it would\n25 adjudicate certain requests, but that new DACA requests and applications for employment\n26 authorization would be rejected starting immediately.  DHS would adjudicate, on a case-by-case\n27 basis, DACA renewal requests received within thirty days from beneficiaries whose DACA\n28 status would expire before March 5, 2018.  She also instructed DHS to immediately stop\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 13 of 49\n1 approving new applications for advance parole.  The rescission left in place all extant grants of\n2 deferred action and work authorizations for the remainder of their validity periods (AR 252–56). \n3 Consequently, starting in March 2018, the DACA population will, over two years, dwindle down\n4 to zero. \n5 On the night of the rescission, President Trump called upon Congress specifically to\n6 enact DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n7 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!”  During an interview\n8 earlier in 2017, President Trump had stated “we are not after the dreamers, we are after the\n9 criminals” and that “the dreamers should rest easy” (App. 1852–53, 1958). \n10 In sum, the new administration didn’t terminate DACA on policy grounds.  It terminated\nt 11 DACA over a point of law, a pithy conclusion that the agency had exceeded its statutory and\nr\nu\no a 12 constitutional authority.  An important question now presented is whether that conclusion was a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 mistake of law.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 5. THE INSTANT LITIGATION.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Plaintiffs herein filed five related non-class lawsuits in this district, all now before the\nS N 16 undersigned judge.  The first commenced on September 8, brought by The Regents of the\nted  For the  17 University of California, on its own behalf and on behalf of its students, and Janet Napolitano,\ni\nn\nU\n18 in her official capacity as President of the University.  UC Plaintiffs allege they have invested\n19 considerable resources in recruiting students and staff who are DACA recipients, and that these\n20 individuals make important contributions to the University.  As DACA recipients lose their work\n21 authorizations, UC Plaintiffs allege that the University will lose significant intellectual capital\n22 and productivity.  They further allege that students who lose DACA protections will be unable\n23 “to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships and certain financial aid and\n24 scholarships, study abroad, or work to pay their tuition and other expenses,” and as a result may\n25 withdraw from the University altogether (UC Compl. ¶¶ 4–6, 34–37, 48–49).4 \n26\n27\n4  Two additional DACA lawsuits proceed in the Eastern District of New York before Judge Nicholas\nGaraufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case No. 16-cv-04756\n28\nNGG.\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 14 of 49\n1 On September 11, the States of California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota filed suit. \n2 Plaintiff States allege that they are home to more than 238,000 DACA recipients, and that the\n3 loss of their residents’ DACA status and work authorizations will injure their public colleges\n4 and universities, upset the States’ workforces, disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory\n5 interests, cause harm to hundreds of thousands of their residents, damage their economies,\n6 and hurt companies based in Plaintiff States (States Compl. ¶¶ 1–10).  \n7 The City of San Jose, on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees who are DACA\n8 recipients, filed its action on September 14.  San Jose alleges that it has hired DACA recipients\n9 into vital City jobs, that substantial resources were invested in training these employees, and that\n10 the City will be harmed when these employees are forced to leave the workforce (when they lose\nt 11 their work authorizations).  San Jose further alleges that it will continue to lose tax revenue as\nr\nu\no a 12 DACA recipients lose work authorizations and can no longer contribute to the City’s tax base\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 (San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 10, 28, 49–51). \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 On September 18, Individual DACA recipients Dulce Garcia, Miriam Gonzalez Avila,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Saul Jimenez Suarez, Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza, Norma Ramirez, and Jirayut\nS N 16 Latthivongskorn brought suit to challenge the termination of DACA.  Individual Plaintiffs work\nted  For the  17 and study in the fields of law, medicine, education, and psychology.  They allege that the loss of\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA will frustrate their professional goals and accomplishments.  They further allege that as a\n19 result of the rescission, they will lose access to numerous federal and state benefits, and may not\n20 be able to reside in the United States with their families.  They applied for DACA in reliance on\n21 the government’s representations that information provided under the program would not be\n22 used for purposes of immigration enforcement (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 4–9, 55, 59, 72, 78, 85, 95,\n23 128). \n24 Finally, the County of Santa Clara and the Service Employees International Union Local\n25 521 filed their complaint on October 10.  The County alleges that it employs DACA recipients,\n26 including union members, in key positions, such as in its In-Home Supportive Services Program\n27 and New Americans Fellowship Program.  The County alleges that it has expended time and\n28 money in training these employees, and that it relies on them to provide important services. \n14\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 15 of 49\n1 As DACA recipients leave the workforce, the County will lose important employees, will incur\n2 harm to its economy and suffer decreased tax revenue, and will incur the costs of increased\n3 dependency on subsidized health care and other County services.  Local 521 sues as an\n4 associational plaintiff on behalf of its members who are DACA recipients, and alleges that the\n5 Union’s organizational mission is to organize, represent, and empower employees, as well as\n6 mobilize immigration reform (Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 1, 15–20, 32, 37, 43–52). \n7 Collectively, plaintiffs assert the following claims: \n8 • The rescission violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it\n9 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in\n10 accordance with law (UC Compl. ¶¶ 50–58; State Compl. ¶¶ 152–55;\nt 11 Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 165–84; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 67–73).\nr\nu\no a 12 • The rescission violated the APA because it was a substantive rule that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 did not comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements or\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Regulatory Flexibility Act’s mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 604 that\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 an agency publish analysis of a rule’s impact on small businesses\nS N 16 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 59–66; State Compl. ¶¶ 146–63; San Jose Compl.\nted  For the  17 ¶¶ 59–63; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 177–84).\ni\nn\nU\n18 • The rescission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally-protected\n19 property and liberty interests without due process of law.  Plaintiffs also\n20 allege that the rescission violated due process because the government\n21 changed its policy regarding agency use of DACA-related information\n22 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 67–73; State Compl. ¶¶ 141–45; Garcia Compl.\n23 ¶¶ 133–47; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 59–66).\n24 • The rescission violates equal protection of the law because it was\n25 motivated by discriminatory animus and because it deprived DACA\n26 grantees of their substantial interests in supporting themselves and\n27 furthering their education (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77; San Jose Compl.\n28 ¶¶ 52–58; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 148–59; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 74–78).\n15\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 16 of 49\n1 • The rescission violates equitable estoppel.  DACA recipients provided\n2 detailed personal information to the government and rearranged their\n3 lives based on the government’s representations, but now face the\n4 possibility of removal.  Plaintiffs argue that the government should\n5 therefore be equitably estopped from terminating DACA or from using\n6 their DACA information for immigration enforcement purposes (State\n7 Compl. ¶¶ 164–71; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 192–99; Santa Clara Compl.\n8 ¶¶ 79–86).\n9 • Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the rescission was unlawful and an\n10 order restoring DACA (UC Compl. at 16, State Compl. at 35–36;\nt 11 San Jose Compl. at 15–16; Garcia Compl. at 43; Santa Clara Compl.\nr\nu\no a 12 at 26–27). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 On September 21, an initial case management conference occurred for all DACA actions\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 in our district.  At the conference, all counsel, including government counsel, presented a joint\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 proposal whereby the government would file the administrative record by October 13. \nS N 16 Significantly, although the government argued that discovery would be premature, it agreed to\nted  For the  17 submit the administrative record without any condition that it be done before any decision on its\ni\nn\nU\n18 threshold jurisdictional motion (presumably because it knew its jurisdictional motion would be\n19 premised on the administrative record) (see Dkt. No. 114 at 16; Tr. at 17:3, 22:2).  The Court\n20 made only slight revisions to the joint proposal, all in aid of a stated goal of providing a full\n21 record and final decision for our court of appeals prior to the March 5 expiration date.  Pursuant\n22 to FRCP 26, a case management order then set a October 6 deadline for the government to file\n23 the administrative record, set a briefing schedule for the parties’ motions to dismiss, for\n24 provisional relief, or for summary judgment, and permitted the parties to proceed with\n25 reasonable, limited, and narrowly-directed discovery (Dkt. No. 49).\n26 The government filed an administrative record on October 6.  It was merely, however,\n27 fourteen documents comprising 256 pages of which 187 consisted of published opinions from\n28 the DAPA litigation, and all of which already resided in the public domain.  All non-public\n16\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 17 of 49\n1 materials, some eighty-four documents, actually reviewed by the Acting Secretary remained\n2 withheld as privileged (Dkt. No. 71).  In other words, of the ninety-eight DACA-related\n3 documents personally considered by the decisionmaker, all but the fourteen already known to\n4 the public were withheld as privileged.  Although government counsel further indicated, upon\n5 inquiry by the district judge, that the decisionmaker had also likely received verbal input,\n6 nothing was included in the administrative record to capture this input.  Nor were there any\n7 materials regarding the agency’s earlier, recent decisions to leave DACA in place.  \n8 On October 9, plaintiffs moved to require the government to complete the administrative\n9 record, seeking all materials considered directly or indirectly by the Acting Secretary in\n10 reaching her decision to rescind DACA, which motion was granted in part and denied in part. \nt 11 The government, having earlier consented to filing the administrative record, was ordered to\nr\nu\no a 12 keep its word and to file a complete administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 65, 79–80).\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Instead, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus with our court of appeals,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 seeking relief from having to complete the administrative record until after its jurisdictional\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 arguments were determined, a turnabout from its earlier voluntary proposal and stipulation to\nS N 16 file the administrative record as part of an agreed-upon schedule.  After full briefing and oral\nted  For the  17 argument, our court of appeals denied the government’s mandamus petition and vacated the\ni\nn\nU\n18 stay (over one dissent).5  \n19 The government was again ordered to complete the administrative record, this time by\n20 November 22, later extended to December 22 to accommodate the government’s claim of\n21 burden.  On December 1, however, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus and\n22 application for a stay in the United States Supreme Court.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court did\n23 not reach the merits of the government’s petition but required that defendants’ jurisdictional\n24 defenses be adjudicated prior to consideration of discovery or completing the administrative\n25\n5  Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the government’s petition\n26\nfor a writ of mandamus to stay an order to supplement the same administrative record.  The court of appeals\nfound that there was “a strong suggestion that the record before the District Court was not complete” and, noting\n27\nthat nearly 200 pages of the record consisted of published opinions from various federal courts, “[i]t is difficult\nto imagine that a decision as important as whether to repeal DACA would be made based upon a factual record\n28\nof little more than 56 pages, even accepting that litigation risk was the reason for repeal.”  In Re: Kirstjen M.\nNielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d. Cir. Dec. 27, 2017).\n17\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 18 of 49\n1 record (Dkt. Nos. 86, 188, 197, 214, 224), a decision the district judge himself might have made\n2 at the outset save for the government’s own proposal and agreement to file the administrative\n3 record in October. \n4 Consequently, this action has proceeded on the incomplete administrative record\n5 initially filed by the government.  Plaintiffs have been forced to draw on other materials. \n6 Ironically, even the government in these motions relies on material outside of the administrative\n7 record to defend the agency decision (Dkt. No. 204 at 10, 12, 19–20).  The parties have now\n8 fully briefed motions to dismiss and a motion for provisional relief, all argued on December 20\n9 (Dkt. Nos. 111, 114).  This order now follows.\n10 ANALYSIS\nt 11 1. MOTION TO DISMISS.\nr\nu\no a 12 Defendants raise three jurisdictional arguments under FRCP 12(b)(1).  First, they argue\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 that the decision to rescind DACA was a discretionary act barred from judicial review under\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the APA.  Second, they contend that the INA bars judicial review.  Third, although defendants\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 concede that Individual Plaintiffs have standing, they contend that no others do.  Each is\nS N 16 now addressed in turn.  A separate order will consider defendants’ motion to dismiss under\nted  For the  17 FRCP 12(b)(6).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. The DACA Rescission Was Not Committed \nTo Agency Discretion by Law.\n19\nCongress has instructed our district courts to review and set aside agency action found\n20\nto be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n21\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Under the APA, however, our district courts lack subject-matter\n22\njurisdiction to review agency action that is “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C.\n23\n§ 701(a)(2).  \n24\nIn Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), the\n25\nSupreme Court explained that the jurisdictional bar of Section 701(a)(2) is “very narrow” and\n26\n“applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given\n27\ncase there is no law to apply.”  The Supreme Court held that because the statute there at issue\n28\ncontained “clear and specific directives” guiding the agency’s decision, there was “‘law to\n18\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 19 of 49\n1 apply,’ so the exemption for action ‘committed to agency discretion’ [was] inapplicable.”  Id. at\n2 411–13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n3 When it next revisited the exception in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985),\n4 the Supreme Court reiterated that the exception applies only where “the statute is drawn so\n5 that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise\n6 of discretion.”  There, condemned inmates asked the FDA to bring an enforcement action to\n7 prevent purported violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through the\n8 administration of death-penalty drugs.  The FDA Commissioner, however, refused to do so on\n9 the ground that the FDA lacked jurisdiction and otherwise should not interfere with the state\n10 criminal justice system.  Skipping over the agency jurisdiction issue, the Supreme Court held\nt 11 that such decisions not to prosecute or initiate enforcement actions are generally not reviewable\nr\nu\no a 12 as they are “committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id. at 824–25, 831. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Chaney identified several characteristics of non-enforcement decisions as key to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 its holding.  First, non-enforcement decisions require a complicated balancing of factors\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 “peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including whether “resources are best spent on\nS N 16 this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular\nted  For the  17 enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies, and . . . whether the agency\ni\nn\nU\n18 has enough resources to undertake the action at all.”  Id. at 831.  Second, in refusing to act,\n19 an agency “does not exercise its coercive power over an individual’s liberty” and accordingly\n20 “does not infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.”  Id. at 832.  When an\n21 agency does act to enforce, however, that action itself provides a focus for judicial review,\n22 inasmuch as the agency must have exercised its power in some manner.  Third, a refusal to\n23 institute enforcement proceedings is similar to a prosecutor’s decision not to indict, which\n24 decision “has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Ibid.  \n25 Our case is different from Chaney.  There, the agency simply refused to initiate an\n26 enforcement proceeding.  Here, by contrast, the agency has ended a program which has existed\n27 for five years affecting 689,800 enrollees.  Importantly, major policy decisions are “quite\n28 different from day-to-day agency nonenforcement decisions.”  National Treasury Employees\n19\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 20 of 49\n1 Union v. Horner, 854 F.2d 490, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Rather, broad enforcement policies “are\n2 more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the substantive statute rather than\n3 the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive an individual enforcement\n4 decision.”  Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \n5 Even defendants concede that where “the agency’s interpretation of a statute is embedded in a\n6 non-reviewable enforcement policy, the former may be reviewable as such” (Dkt. No. 218 at 3\n7 n.4).  Although they contend that the rescission memorandum “does not contain an embedded\n8 interpretation of the INA,” that assertion is incompatible with the Acting Secretary’s explicit\n9 references to the INA and the Attorney General’s determination that DACA was effectuated\n10 without “statutory authority.”  The first and third Chaney factors, accordingly, do not apply to\nt 11 the instant case.6  \nr\nu\no a 12 Chaney is also distinguishable because, unlike there, here the government reversed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 course after five years of inviting DACA recipients out of the shadows.  In contrast to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 nonenforcement decisions, “rescissions of commitments, whether or not they technically\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 implicate liberty and property interests as defined under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,\nS N 16 exert much more direct influence on the individuals or entities to whom the repudiated\nted  For the  17 commitments were made.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Through\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA, the government has invited undocumented aliens who meet threshold criteria to step\n19 forward, disclose substantial personal information, pay a hefty fee, and comply with ongoing\n20 conditions, all in expectation of (though not a right to) continued deferred action.  DACA\n21 allows enrollees to better plan their careers and lives with a reduced fear of removal.  DACA\n22 work authorizations, for example, allow recipients to join in the mainstream economy (and pay\n23 taxes).  DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least,\n24 if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good\n25 behavior.  This has become an important program for DACA recipients and their families, for\n26\n6  Contrary to defendants, Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir. 1990), is distinguishable\n27\non its facts.  There, the Fifth Circuit addressed a class action stemming from the Immigration and Naturalization\nService’s failure to adjudicate requests for voluntary departure.  The court of appeals determined that the district\n28\ncourt had improperly issued an injunction directing INS to consider particular grounds in deciding individual\nrequests for voluntary departure and employment authorization.  Id. at 1046.  \n20\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 21 of 49\n1 the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy.  An agency action to\n2 terminate it bears no resemblance to an agency decision not to regulate something never before\n3 regulated. \n4 Finally, there is law to apply.  The main, if not exclusive, rationale for ending DACA\n5 was its supposed illegality.  But determining illegality is a quintessential role of the courts.7  \n6 B. The INA Does Not Bar Review.\n7 The principle that courts owe substantial deference to the immigration determinations of\n8 the political branches is important and undisputed.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162\n9 (9th Cir. 2017).  That deference, however, does not remove the decision to rescind DACA from\n10 the ambit of judicial review.  Rather, the Supreme Court has applied the “strong presumption\nt 11 in favor of judicial review of administration action” in the immigration context.  See INS v.\nr\nu\no a 12 St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298–99 (2001). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In this connection, defendants raise two arguments.  First, they contend that review\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of discretionary enforcement decisions results in the inappropriate delay of removal, and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 accordingly prolongs violations of our immigration laws.  This argument, however, again\nS N 16 ignores that plaintiffs do not challenge any particular removal but, rather, challenge the abrupt\nted  For the  17 end to a nationwide deferred-action and work-authorization program.  In any individual case,\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA allows DHS to revoke deferred status and to deport.  Second, defendants assert that\n19 review of such decisions may involve disclosure of law enforcement priorities and\n20 foreign-policy objectives.  Neither concern is implicated here, as defendants’ stated reasons\n21 for the rescission all relate to the across-the-board cancellation of DACA based on supposed\n22 illegality, not to the facts particular to any proposed removal. \n23\n24\n25\n26\n7  Defendants are correct, of course, that a presumptively unreviewable agency action does not become\n27\nreviewable simply because “the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable action.”  ICC v.\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’s, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987).  As discussed above, however, the rescission of DACA\n28\nwas not such an unreviewable decision.\n21\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 22 of 49\n1 Nor does Section 1252(g) bar judicial review of the agency action in question.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1252(g) provides:\n3 Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . no court shall have\n4 jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\narising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to\n5 commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal\norders against any alien under this chapter.  \n6\nAs explained by the Supreme Court, this provision applies only to the three discrete\n7\ndecisions or actions named in Section 1252(g).  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.  Plaintiffs’ claims do\n8\nnot involve such decisions, but rather the challenge here is to the across-the-board cancellation\n9\nof a nationwide program.8 \n10\nDefendants recognize that these actions were brought prior to the commencement of\nt 11\nr\nu any removal proceedings.  Nevertheless, they argue that Section 1252(g) precludes review of\no a 12\nC ni\n  or plaintiffs’ claims because the decision to discontinue deferred action is “an ingredient to the\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  commencement of enforcement proceedings.”  It is true that eliminating DACA draws its\n Dis District  14 enrollees one step closer to deportation, but the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\ntates orthern  15 Section 1252(g) somehow precludes review of the “many other decisions or actions that may be\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 part of the deportation process.”  As AADC emphasized, “[i]t is implausible that the mention of\ni\nn three discrete events along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of referring to all claims\nU\n18\narising from deportation proceedings.”  Ibid.  \n19\nDefendants cite two decisions.  Importantly, however, both stemmed from already-\n20\ncommenced deportation or removal proceedings.  See Botezatu v. I.N.S., 195 F.3d 311, 312\n21\n(7th Cir. 1999) (declining to review a decision to deny deferred action after plaintiff had been\n22\nfound deportable); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 899–900 (3d Cir. 2016) (district court\n23\nlacked jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petition that claimed plaintiff was improperly denied\n24\nDACA relief).  \n25\nBy comparison, our court of appeals has held, following AADC, that Section 1252(g)\n26\ndoes not bar review of actions that occur “prior to any decision to ‘commence proceedings.’” \n27\n28\n8  The district court in Batalla Vidal also concluded that Section 1252(g) did not bar judicial review of\nchallenges to the DACA rescission.  Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 2017 WL 5201116, at *13.\n22\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 23 of 49\n1 Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 965 (9th Cir. 2004).  The claims in Kwai Fun\n2 Wong challenged the revocation of the plaintiff’s parole without first deciding her application\n3 for immigration relief, conduct which “resulted in the INS’s decision to commence removal\n4 proceedings and ultimately to remove” the plaintiff from the United States.  Id. at 959, 964. \n5 Contrary to defendants, it is immaterial that Kwai Fun Wong did not involve deferred action,\n6 as both the revocation of parole and the revocation of deferred action are “an ingredient” to the\n7 commencement of enforcement proceedings.  The jurisdictional limits of Section 1252(g) were\n8 instead “directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal\n9 proceedings.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.\n10 C. Most Plaintiffs Have Standing.\nt 11 To establish standing, Article III of the United States Constitution requires plaintiffs\nr\nu\no a 12 to show “(1) they suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 560–61 (1992)).  The standing inquiry is focused on whether the plaintiff has a sufficient\nS N 16 personal stake in the outcome of the controversy to ensure that the parties will be truly adverse\nted  For the  17 and their legal presentations sharpened.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).  Standing\ni\nn\nU\n18 must be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352\n19 (2006).\n20 Defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs have standing.  Rather, they argue\n21 in brief that the entity plaintiffs (the state and local governments, UC Plaintiffs, and SEIU Local\n22 521) lack Article III standing because the rescission does not regulate or restrict them in any\n23 way.  Defendants therefore posit that the entity plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are due only to\n24 “incidental effects” of the rescission, which defendants contend are insufficient to establish\n25 injury-in-fact.  As set forth below, these arguments lack merit.  \n26 First, California, Maryland, the City of San Jose, and the County of Santa Clara each\n27 employ DACA recipients, in connection with whom they have invested substantial resources\n28 in hiring and training.  Plaintiffs allege that they will not only lose these employees as work\n23\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 24 of 49\n1 authorizations expire, but that they will also need to expend additional resources to hire and train\n2 replacements.  San Jose further alleges that as a result of the rescission, the City has had\n3 decreased productivity, and that it has had to expend time and resources to deal with decreased\n4 employee morale (States Compl. ¶¶ 26–27, 32, 53; San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 49–50; Santa Clara\n5 Compl. ¶¶ 32–37; App. 11, 95–97, 706–07, 798, 1575–76). \n6 Second, Plaintiff States, including Maine and Maryland, stand to lose significant tax\n7 revenue as a result of the rescission (States Compl. ¶¶ 28–30, 37, 49–50, 70–71).  Although\n8 general allegations of injury to a state’s economy and the associated decline in general tax\n9 revenues may not be sufficient to establish standing, here, Plaintiff States sufficiently allege a\n10 “direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.”  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S.\nt 11 437, 448 (1992).  They allege, for example, that Maine stands to lose $96,000 in annual state\nr\nu\no a 12 and local taxes as DACA recipients leave the workforce (States Compl. ¶¶ 30, 38).  Evidence\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 submitted by plaintiffs supports these allegations, and demonstrates that DACA’s rescission\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 would reduce state and local tax contributions by DACA-eligible individuals by at least half\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (App. 68–74, 218–30). \nS N 16 Third, the University of California has also established that it will suffer injury to its\nted  For the  17 proprietary interests.  As declarations submitted by the University demonstrate, the rescission\ni\nn\nU\n18 has harmed the University in multiple ways.  Because DACA recipients can no longer seek\n19 advance parole, these students are unable to travel outside of the United States for research and\n20 educational conferences.  DACA recipients have also decided to cancel their enrollment in the\n21 University, and additional recipients are at risk of dropping out, because they would not be able\n22 to pay the cost of attendance without work authorizations. The University has also invested\n23 resources in recruiting and retaining DACA recipients as employees in various roles, including\n24 as teaching assistants and health care providers.  Such investments would be lost should these\n25 employees lose their ability to work in the United States.  \n26 California, Maryland, and Minnesota also allege injury to their public universities\n27 through harm to their educational missions and the loss of students and teachers.  According to\n28 the declarations filed by plaintiffs, the rescission, and the resulting loss of work authorization\n24\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 25 of 49\n1 and potential for deportation, will adversely impact the diversity of the talent pool of potential\n2 students, which will make it more difficult for the universities to fulfill their missions of\n3 increasing diversity (States Compl. ¶¶ 27, 55, 64–66; App. 12–16, 496–514, 884–90).  Our court\n4 of appeals recently affirmed the standing of two state governments to challenge an immigration\n5 policy that similarly harmed the plaintiffs’ public universities.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d\n6 1151, 1160–01 (9th Cir. 2017).  These injuries accordingly give the University of California and\n7 the States of California, Maryland, and Minnesota Article III standing.  Ibid. (citing Singleton v.\n8 Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114–16 (1976)).9\n9 Fourth, State Plaintiffs Maryland and Minnesota further allege that the rescission will\n10 negatively impact their public health programs.  In particular, Maryland and Minnesota allege\nt 11 that rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their employer-based health\nr\nu\no a 12 insurance, imposing higher healthcare costs on the state (State Compl. ¶¶ 51, 62).  These injuries\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are also sufficient to confer Article III standing.10  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Finally, SEIU Local 521 has associational standing to bring its claims on behalf of its\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 members who are DACA recipients.  An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nS N 16 members when:  (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right;\nted  For the  17 (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the\ni\nn\nU\n18 claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\n19 lawsuit.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock,\n20\n21\n9  The public universities of California, Maryland, and Minnesota are branches of the states under state\nlaw.  Campbell v. Regents of Univ. of California, 35 Cal. 4th 311, 321 (2005); Hanauer v. Elkins, 217 Md. 213,\n22\n219, 141 A.2d 903, 906 (Md. 1958); Univ. of Minn. v. Raygor, 620 N.W.2d 680, 683 (Minn. 2001).  \n23\n10  Although not discussed by the parties, the District of Columbia Circuit held that Joe Arpaio, Sheriff\nof Maricopa County, Arizona, lacked Article III standing to challenge DACA.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11\n24 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  While the court of appeals found that the plaintiff’s alleged harm — increased spending on\ncriminal investigation, apprehension, and incarceration — was sufficiently concrete, his theory that DACA\n25\nwould lead to an increased number of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in his jurisdiction was too\nspeculative.  Id. at 19–20.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs allege that the rescission will cause DACA recipients to\n26\nlose their work authorizations, and that plaintiffs will lose employees and students, suffer decreased tax revenue,\nand otherwise incur increased costs as a direct result.  This case is also different from Crane v. Johnson,\n27\n783 F.3d 244, 252 (5th Cir. 2015), where the Fifth Circuit held that Mississippi lacked standing to challenge\nDACA because it failed to submit evidence that DACA eligible immigrants resided in the state.  Defendants do\n28\nnot dispute State Plaintiffs’ allegations that hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients live in Plaintiff States.  \n25\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 26 of 49\n1 477 U.S. 274, 282 (1986) (quoting Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n,\n2 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  SEIU has established all three elements here.  SEIU has members\n3 who are DACA recipients.  Its constitution states that part of its mission is to provide its\n4 members with a voice in the larger community, and that its members should be treated equally\n5 with dignity regardless of immigration status or national origin.  SEIU has also formed a\n6 Committee on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a member-based committee that engages in\n7 organizing, advocacy, and education to help undocumented workers.  Its members’ interests in\n8 these actions are therefore germane to SEIU’s stated purpose (App. 801–09).  Furthermore, this\n9 action does not require the participation of SEIU’s individual members.  \n10 Defendants, in arguing that the entity plaintiffs lack standing, rely solely on Linda R.S. v.\nt 11 Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973).  There, the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a Texas\nr\nu\no a 12 state court’s interpretation of a child support statute.  Ibid.  The Supreme Court held that,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 although the plaintiff had alleged an injury, she had not shown “a direct nexus between the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 vindication of her interest and the enforcement of the State’s criminal laws” because the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 relationship between the state’s decision not to prosecute and the father’s decision not to pay\nS N 16 under the statute could “at best, be termed only speculative.”  Id. at 618–19.  Linda R.S. has no\nted  For the  17 application here.  As explained above, the entity plaintiffs have alleged harm to their proprietary\ni\nn\nU\n18 interests as a direct result of defendants’ decision to terminate the DACA program, most notably\n19 through its termination of work authorizations.  Accordingly, the entity plaintiffs have\n20 sufficiently alleged injury-in-fact traceable to the termination of DACA, and have demonstrated\n21 that these harms are redressable by their requested relief.11 \n22 Turning to prudential standing under the APA, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered\n23 or will suffer sufficient injury-in-fact, and that “the interest[s] sought to be protected by the\n24 complainant [are] arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the\n25 statute . . . in question.”  Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.\n26 479, 488 (1998).  \n27\n11  Because defendants’ conduct imposes direct injury on the State Plaintiffs’ proprietary interests, this\n28\norder need not reach defendants’ argument that the State Plaintiffs lack standing as parens patriae.\n26\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 27 of 49\n1 A plaintiff that is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action lacks prudential\n2 standing only where its interests “are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\n3 implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\n4 suit.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987).  This test is “not meant to be\n5 especially demanding,” and must be applied “in keeping with Congress’s evident intent when\n6 enacting the APA to make agency action presumably reviewable.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n7 Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quotations and citations\n8 omitted).  \n9 The parties’ briefs include only a cursory discussion of plaintiffs’ prudential standing\n10 under the APA.  Again, defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs also have\nt 11 statutory standing.  SEIU, which asserts the rights of its members who are DACA recipients,\nr\nu\no a 12 likewise seeks the protection of interests regulated by the INA.  Not all of the entity plaintiffs,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 however, have established prudential standing to proceed on their APA claims.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Plaintiffs primarily rely on our court of appeals’ recent decision in Hawaii v. Trump,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 859 F.3d 741, 765 (9th Cir. 2017), as well as on various provisions of the INA which provide for\nS N 16 student- and employment-related immigrant visas.  Plaintiffs do not contend, however, that their\nted  For the  17 DACA-recipient students or employees qualify for such visas.  Nor do plaintiffs point to\ni\nn\nU\n18 any provisions of the INA which indicate a protected interest in enrolling students with deferred\n19 action in their schools or universities.  Plaintiffs are also unable to point to any provision of the\n20 INA indicating that Congress intend to protected Plaintiff States’ interests in maintaining income\n21 tax revenue or avoiding increased healthcare costs.  \n22 By contrast, local and state governments San Jose, Santa Clara, California, and\n23 Maryland, as well as the University of California, have all identified injuries resulting from their\n24 status as employers, and allege harm caused by their employees’ future loss of deferred action\n25 and associated work authorization.  The INA gives the Executive Branch broad discretion to\n26 determine when noncitizens may work in the United States, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3), and\n27 regulations promulgated pursuant to this authority allow recipients of deferred action to apply\n28 for work authorization if they can demonstrate an “economic necessity for employment.” \n27\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 28 of 49\n1 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Moreover, the INA contains detailed provisions which subject\n2 employers to criminal and civil liability for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens, see 8 U.S.C.\n3 § 1324a(a)(1)(A), and for “continu[ing] to employ the alien in the United States knowing\n4 the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment,” id.\n5 § 1324a(a)(2).  The work authorization document that the agency issues to DACA recipients\n6 is one of the documents that is acceptable for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification,\n7 which employers must complete and retain for each individual they hire for employment in the\n8 United States (App. 2061–62).  Plaintiffs’ interest in their employees’ continued authorization\n9 to work in the United States is therefore “arguably within the zone of interests” that the INA\n10 protects.  Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 765; Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at 488.12\nt 11 Accordingly, even though the zone of interests inquiry is not demanding, this order\nr\nu\no a 12 concludes that Maine and Minnesota’s interests are “so marginally related” to the purposes\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 implicit in the INA that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 suit.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are accordingly DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The remaining entity plaintiffs, however, have established that their interests that support\nS N 16 Article III standing also satisfy the APA’s zone of interests test.  \nted  For the  17 *                        *                        *\ni\nn\nU\n18 Apart from the holding that Maine and Minnesota do not have statutory standing, the\n19 foregoing rejects all of the government’s jurisdictional arguments to dismiss plaintiffs’\n20 challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n21 2. PROVISIONAL RELIEF.\n22 Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to restore DACA.  To support a preliminary\n23 injunction, plaintiffs must establish four elements:  (1) likelihood of success on the merits;\n24 (2) irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in\n25\n26 12  Defendants’ sole argument against the entity plaintiffs’ prudential standing is that no provision\nof the INA protects the entity plaintiffs from “bearing the incidental effects” of a denial of deferred action. \n27\nThe case on which defendants rely, however, dealt with a private anti-immigration organization whose members\nwere not impacted by the immigration policy at issue.  See Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno,\n28 93 F.3d 897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 29 of 49\n1 their favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Resources\n2 Defense Council Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  As now explained, the record warrants most of the\n3 provisional relief requested.  \n4 A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n5 Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the rescission\n6 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with law. \n7 Specifically, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that:  (1) the agency’s decision to\n8 rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise; and (2) government counsel’s supposed\n9 “litigation risk” rationale is a post hoc rationalization and would be, in any event, arbitrary and\n10 capricious.\nt 11 (1) The Rescission was Based on a Flawed Legal Premise.\nr\nu\no a 12 The agency action was “not in accordance with law” because it was based on the flawed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 legal premise that the agency lacked authority to implement DACA.  When agency action is\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 based on a flawed legal premise, it may be set as aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532\nS N 16 (setting aside the EPA’s denial of a petition for rulemaking under the Clean Air Act for\nted  For the  17 supposed lack of authority); Safe Air for Everyone v. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007). \ni\nn\nU\n18 This order holds that DACA fell within the agency’s enforcement authority.  The contrary\n19 conclusion was flawed and should be set aside.  \n20 The administrative record includes the 2014 determination of the Office of Legal Counsel\n21 of the United States Department of Justice that programmatic deferred action is a permissible\n22 exercise of DHS’s enforcement discretion.  OLC noted that deferred action programs such as\n23 DACA are permissible so long as immigration officials retain discretion to evaluate each\n24 application on an individualized basis and so long as the concerns animating the program were\n25 consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration\n26 enforcement discretion.  OLC recognized that the “practice of granting deferred action date[d]\n27 back several decades,” and that “Congress has long been aware of the practice of granting\n28 deferred action, including in its categorical variety, and of its salient features; and it has never\n29\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 30 of 49\n1 acted to disapprove or limit the practice.”  Indeed, not only has Congress not limited the practice,\n2 but it has “enacted several pieces of legislation that have either assumed that deferred action\n3 would be available in certain circumstances, or expressly directed that deferred action be\n4 extended to certain categories of aliens” (AR 15–27). \n5 As explained in OLC’s opinion, each feature of the DACA program is anchored in\n6 authority granted or recognized by Congress or the Supreme Court.  Because this is the heart\n7 of the problem, and with apology for some repetition, this order will now examine each feature\n8 in turn.  \n9 The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible under the INA for “establishing\n10 national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  The Secretary is\nt 11 also charged with the administration and enforcement of the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1103.  In making\nr\nu\no a 12 immigration enforcement decisions, the executive “considers a variety of factors such as the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 danger posed to the United States of an individual’s unlawful presence, the impact of removal\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 on the nation’s international relations, and the ‘human concerns’ of whether the individual ‘has\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished\nS N 16 military service.’”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Arizona v. United\nted  For the  17 States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012)).  In instituting DACA, Secretary Napolitano explained that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the program was “necessary to ensure that [DHS’s] enforcement resources are not expended on\n19 [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement\n20 priorities” (AR 1).13\n21 As set forth above, deferred action originated without any statutory basis apart from the\n22 discretion vested by Congress in connection with the agency’s enforcement of the immigration\n23 laws.  Over the decades, however, deferred action became such a fixture that Congress referred\n24 to it by name in several INA amendments.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2) (stating that U visa\n25 and T visa applicants who were denied an administrative stay of removal were not precluded\n26 from applying for “deferred action”); 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (stating that eligible\n27\n13  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not reach the merits of\n28\nSheriff Joe Arpaio’s challenges to DACA and DAPA but instead dismissed the case for lack of Article III\nstanding.  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 15.\n30\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 31 of 49\n1 derivatives of VAWA petitioners were eligible for “deferred action” and work authorization); 8\n2 U.S.C. § 1151 note (stating that certain immediate family members of certain United States\n3 citizens “shall be eligible for deferred action”).  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action\n4 in enactments outside of the INA.  See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 30301 note (specifying that evidence of\n5 lawful status includes proof of “deferred action status”); USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L.\n6 No. 107-56, § 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (stating that immediate family members of legal\n7 permanent residents killed on September 11, 2001 “may be eligible for deferred action”). \n8 Congress has been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action,\n9 but it has yet to do so.  \n10 The Supreme Court has recognized the authority of DHS to grant relief from removal,\nt 11 Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396, and has specifically recognized deferred action as a way to exercise\nr\nu\no a 12 that discretion — “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the Executive’s] own convenience.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Notably, our court of appeals has said that “the exercise of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 prosecutorial discretion in deferred action flows from the authority conferred on the Secretary by\n  Di\nStates Northern  1156 IthI”e) .I1N4 A  .”  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 968 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Brewer\nted  For the  17 In extending programmatic deferred action to DACA enrollees, the agency acted within\ni\nn\nU\n18 the scope of this long and recognized practice.  In the exercise of its enforcement discretion and\n19 policy-making, the agency simply found that DACA enrollees represented low priority cases\n20 for removal and instituted DACA to manage that population while it redirected its resources\n21 elsewhere.  Even for enrollees approved under the program, DHS expressly retained the\n22 authority to terminate their deferred action at any time, in the agency’s discretion.  DACA\n23 provided no guarantee against removal.  \n24 Nevertheless, DACA has provided recipients with a major benefit, namely work\n25 authorizations for the period of deferral upon a demonstration of economic need.  This has\n26\n27\n14  In Brewer II, our court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  Circuit Judge Kozinski,\njoined by five other Circuit Judges, filed a dissent to the denial of the petition, expressing the view that DACA\n28\ndid not preempt Arizona’s law refusing to issue drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients.  855 F.3d at 958–62.\n31\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 32 of 49\n1 allowed DACA recipients to become part of the mainstream workforce and contribute openly\n2 to our economy.  Significantly, Section 1324a(h)(3) defines an “unauthorized alien” not entitled\n3 to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident nor “authorized\n4 to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”  In turn, the\n5 Secretary of Homeland Security has allowed work authorizations in cases of deferred action\n6 under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  As our court of appeals has stated, “the Executive Branch has\n7 determined that deferred action recipients — including DACA recipients — are ordinarily\n8 authorized to work in the United States.”  See Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1062.  \n9 It is also within the lawful authority of the agency to determine that DACA recipients\n10 do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry.  Pursuant to\nt 11 pre-existent DHS regulations and policy guidance, deferred action recipients already avoided\nr\nu\no a 12 accrual of “unlawful presence.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2);\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Memorandum for Field Leadership, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Operations Directorate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 for Purposes of Sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009). \nS N 16 Importantly, DHS excludes recipients of deferred action from being “unlawfully present”\nted  For the  17 because their deferred action is considered a period of stay authorized by the government.  See 8\ni\nn\nU\n18 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present if the alien is present “in\n19 the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\n20 [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]”); Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059.\n21 Allowing DACA recipients to apply for and obtain advance parole to travel overseas and\n22 return to the United States is also in accord with pre-existing regulations.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f);\n23 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (the Attorney General [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]\n24 may “in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he\n25 may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public\n26 benefit”).\n27 In short, what exactly is the part of DACA that oversteps the authority of the agency? \n28 Is it the granting of deferred action itself?  No, deferred action has been blessed by both the\n32\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 33 of 49\n1 Supreme Court and Congress as a means to exercise enforcement discretion.  Is it the granting\n2 of deferred action via a program (as apposed to ad hoc individual grants)?  No, programmatic\n3 deferred action has been in use since at least 1997, and other forms of programmatic\n4 discretionary relief date back to at least 1956.  Is it granting work authorizations coextensive\n5 with the two-year period of deferred action?  No, aliens receiving deferred action have been able\n6 to apply for work authorization for decades.  Is it granting relief from accruing “unlawful\n7 presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on reentry?  No, such relief dates back to the George\n8 W. Bush Administration for those receiving deferred action.  Is it allowing recipients to apply for\n9 and obtain advance parole?  No, once again, granting advance parole has all been in accord\n10 with pre-existing law.  Is it combining all these elements into a program?  No, if each step is\nt 11 within the authority of the agency, then how can combining them in one program be outside its\nr\nu\no a 12 authority, so long as the agency vets each applicant and exercises its discretion on a case-by-case\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 basis?\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Significantly, the government makes no effort in its briefs to challenge any of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 foregoing reasons why DACA was and remains within the authority of the agency.  Nor does the\nS N 16 government challenge any of the statutes and regulations under which deferred action recipients\nted  For the  17 obtain the foregoing benefits.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Instead, the administrative record shows that the Attorney General told the Acting\n19 Secretary that DACA was illegal.  First, the Attorney General said that DACA had been\n20 improperly adopted by the Obama Administration after “Congress’ repeated rejection of\n21 proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.”  But the proposals rejected\n22 by Congress markedly differ from DACA.  Importantly, while the proposed legislation would\n23 have offered Dreamers the ability to become lawful permanent residents, no comparable\n24 pathway was offered by DACA.  Our court of appeals recognized this distinction, noting that “the\n25 DREAM Act and the DACA program are not interchangeable policies because they provided\n26 different forms of relief.”  Brewer II, 855 F.3d at 976 n.10.  In fact, the 2012 DACA memo\n27 made explicit that DACA offered no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\n28 citizenship.  Secretary Napolitano concluded her memo by stating that DACA “confer[ed] no\n33\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 34 of 49\n1 substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.”  To claim that DACA was\n2 rejected by Congress, therefore, is unfair.15\n3 Second, another criticism of DACA was that applications received mechanical, routine\n4 approval without individualized consideration.  In her rescission memorandum, the Acting\n5 Secretary indicated that “[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] has not been\n6 able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic\n7 categorical criteria as outlined in the [original DACA] memorandum, but still had his or her\n8 application denied based solely upon discretion.”  The simple answer to this, if true, would be\n9 for the agency to instruct its adjudicators to exercise discretion, on a individualized basis, to\n10 make sure applicants do not pose a threat to national security or public safety and are otherwise\nt 11 deserving of deferred action.  \nr\nu\no a 12 It appears, moreover, that the Acting Secretary was in error when she said that USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 has been unable to identify discretionary denials of DACA applications.  She cited no evidence\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 for this fact, and none is found in the administrative record.  Possibly, the Acting Secretary relied\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 on findings made in the DAPA litigation.  There, the majority panel noted that USCIS could not\nS N 16 produce any applications that satisfied the guidelines of the original DACA memorandum but\nted  For the  17 were nonetheless refused through an exercise of discretion.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 172.  As the\ni\nn\nU\n18 dissent pointed out, however, the district court may have conflated rejections of DACA\n19 applications with denials, and as a result suggested that most denials were made for mechanical,\n20 administrative reasons.  Id. at 210 (King, J., dissenting).  A declaration submitted in that case by\n21 Donald Neufeld, then-Associate Director for Service Center Operations for USCIS, pointed to\n22 several instances of discretionary denials.  Id. at 175.  That same declaration explained that while\n23 a DACA application was rejected when it was “determined upon intake that the application [had]\n24 a fatal flaw,” an application was denied when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by-case basis,\n25 determined that the requestor either had not demonstrated that they satisfied the guidelines for\n26\n15  See, e.g., S. 1291, 107th Congress (2001); S. 1545, 108th Congress (2003); S. 2075, 109th Congress\n27\n(2005); H.R. 5131, 109th Congress (2006); H.R. 1275, 110th Congress (2007); S. 2205, 110th Congress (2007);\nH.R. 1751, 111th Congress (2009); S. 3827, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3962, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3992,\n28\n111th Congress (2010); H.R. 6497, 111th Congress (2010); S. 952, 112th Congress (2011). \n34\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 35 of 49\n1 DACA or when an adjudicator determined that deferred action should be denied even though\n2 the threshold guidelines were met.  Id. at 210–11 (dissent).  The United States District Court\n3 for the District of Columbia, in addressing nearly identical statistics, recognized the distinction. \n4 The district court noted that as of December 2014, 36,860 requests for deferred action under\n5 DACA were denied and another 42,632 applicants were rejected as not eligible, and concluded\n6 that such statistics “reflect that [] case-by-case review is in operation.”  Arpaio, 27 F. Supp. 3d\n7 at 209 n.13.  The administrative record tendered in our case completely fails to explain this\n8 apparent discrepancy.  \n9 Third, the main ground given by the Attorney General for illegality was the Fifth\n10 Circuit’s decision in the DAPA litigation.  DACA, the Attorney General said, suffered from the\nt 11 same “legal and constitutional defects” leveled against DAPA in Texas v. United States, 809\nr\nu\no a 12 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Upon consideration of the full history of that case, however, this was\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 an overstatement.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 In the DAPA litigation, the district court held that DAPA violated the APA’s notice-and-\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 comment procedures because it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the\nS N 16 status and employability of millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal\nted  For the  17 government.”  The district court found that the discretionary aspects of DAPA were “merely\ni\nn\nU\n18 pretext,” based on its finding that DACA had been implemented in such a mechanical way\n19 as to prevent the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis, and DAPA would therefore be\n20 implemented in the same manner.  Notice and opportunity for public comment, it held, should\n21 have accordingly been given.  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 671. \n22 Although the Fifth Circuit recognized that “there was conflicting evidence on the degree\n23 to which DACA allowed discretion,” because the government had failed to produce any\n24 applications that satisfied all of the criteria but were refused deferred action by an exercise of\n25 discretion, it was “not error — clear or otherwise —” for the district court to have concluded that\n26 DHS had only issued denials under mechanical formulae.  The appellate court also pointed to\n27 DACA’s Operating Procedures, which contained “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for\n28\n35\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 36 of 49\n1 granting or denying deferred action,” as supporting the conclusion that DACA did not leave the\n2 agency free to exercise discretion.  \n3 It cautioned, however, that “[f]or a number of reasons, any extrapolation from DACA\n4 must be done carefully.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 173 (emphasis added).  In particular, the appellate\n5 court recognized that DACA involved self-selecting applicants, and those who expected to be\n6 denied relief were unlikely to apply.  Id. at 174.  The court also recognized that “DACA and\n7 DAPA are not identical” and that because eligibility for DACA was restricted to a younger and\n8 less numerous population, DACA applicants were less likely to have backgrounds that would\n9 warrant a discretionary denial.  Ibid.\n10 In addition to affirming the notice-and-comment holding (over one dissent), two of the\nt 11 judges on the Fifth Circuit panel went a large step further and held that DAPA conflicted with\nr\nu\no a 12 the INA.  The majority pointed out that the INA already had a specific provision through which\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 aliens could derive lawful status from their children’s immigration status.  Id. at 180 n.167\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 1201(a), 1255).  DAPA, the majority\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 said, circumvented this statutory pathway.  \nS N 16 The Fifth Circuit also pointed out that the INA had specific provisions through which\nted  For the  17 aliens could be classified as “lawfully present,” could obtain discretionary relief from removal,\ni\nn\nU\n18 or could obtain eligibility for work authorization.  Because DAPA could make 4.3 million\n19 removable aliens eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and associated\n20 benefits, the Fifth Circuit concluded that DAPA implicated “questions of deep ‘economic and\n21 political significance’ that are central to [the INA’s] statutory scheme,” and therefore had\n22 Congress wished to assign that decision to an agency, “it surely would have done so expressly.”  \n23 The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that various provisions of the INA, such as the\n24 broad grant of authority to the agency in 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (providing that the Secretary “shall\n25 be responsible for establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities”),\n26 provided the authority to implement DAPA.  Rather, it found that such grants of authority could\n27 not reasonably be construed as assigning the agency decisions of such massive “economic and\n28 political significance.”  Such an interpretation, the majority said, would allow the agency to\n36\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 37 of 49\n1 grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States.  It\n2 concluded that “even with ‘special deference’ to the Secretary,” the INA did not permit the\n3 reclassification of 4.3 million aliens as “lawfully present,” thereby making them newly eligible\n4 for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\n5 The majority also rejected the argument that DAPA was moored in historical practice,\n6 finding that such historical practice “does not, by itself, create power,” and that in any event,\n7 previous deferred-action programs were not analogous to DAPA because most discretionary\n8 deferrals had been done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or\n9 natural disasters, or had been bridges from one legal status to another.  It found that “[n]othing\n10 like DAPA, which alters the status of more than four million aliens, has ever been contemplated\nt 11 absent direct statutory authorization.” \nr\nu\no a 12 The majority concluded that Congress had “directly addressed the precise question\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 at issue” in DAPA because the INA “prescribes how parents may derive an immigration\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 classification on the basis of their child’s status and which classes of aliens can achieve deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action and eligibility for work authorization.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186.  Because it found that\nS N 16 DAPA was foreclosed by Congress’s “careful plan,” the majority held that the program was\nted  For the  17 “manifestly contrary to the statute.”\ni\nn\nU\n18 While at least some of the majority’s reasons for holding DAPA illegal would apply to\n19 DACA, fairness requires saying that DACA and DAPA were different, as the panel opinion\n20 stated.  An important criticism against DAPA would not apply against DACA, namely the fact\n21 that Congress had already established a pathway to lawful presence for alien parents of citizens\n22 (so that DAPA simply constituted a more lenient substitute route).  DACA, by contrast, has no\n23 such analogue in the INA.  And, there is a difference between 4.3 million and 689,800.  Finally,\n24 the criticism that DACA had been mechanically administered without the exercise of discretion\n25 in individual cases, if true, could be fixed by simply insisting on exercise of discretion.  In sum,\n26 the DAPA litigation was not a death knell for DACA. \n27 This order holds that, in light of our own court of appeals’ reasoning in Brewer I and\n28 Brewer II, in light of the analysis of the Office of Legal Counsel of the United States Department\n37\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 38 of 49\n1 of Justice, and the reasoning set forth above, our court of appeals will likely hold that DACA\n2 was and remains a lawful exercise of authority by DHS.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed\n3 on the merits of their claim that the rescission was based on a flawed legal premise and must be\n4 set aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\n5 law.”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528; Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94\n6 (1943); Safe Air for Everyone, 488 F.3d at 1101.16  \n7 (2) Government Counsel’s Alternative Rationale \nIs Post Hoc and, in Any Event, Arbitrary, \n8 Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n9 Government counsel now advances an alternative rationale for the Secretary’s decision to\n10 rescind DACA.  Counsel contends that DHS acted within its discretion in managing its litigation\nt 11 exposure in the Fifth Circuit, weighing its options, and deciding on an orderly wind down of the\nr\nu\no a 12 program so as to avoid a potentially disastrous injunction in the Fifth Circuit.  This, they say,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 constituted a reasonable judgment call involving management of litigation risk and agency\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 resources.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Courts, of course, may not accept post hoc rationalizations for agency action, see\nS N 16 Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962), nor may they “supply a\nted  For the  17 reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Bowman Transp.,\ni\nn\nU\n18 Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., 419 U.S. 281, 285–86 (1974); see also Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n v.\n19 Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, No. 16-70481 at 15 (9th Cir. Jan. 8, 2018).  Rather, “an\n20 agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”  Motor\n21 Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50\n22 (1983).  \n23\n24\n16  Defendants argue that if the Acting Secretary had relied on DACA’s purported illegality in\n25\nterminating the program, that reliance should be presumed to be a “reasonable policy judgment that immigration\ndecisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.”  This argument finds no support in the administrative\n26\nrecord.  In Syracuse Peace Council v. F.C.C., upon which defendants rely, the agency explicitly based its\ndecision on the independent grounds that a policy was both unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest. \n27\n867 F.2d 654, 656 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Although the court of appeals elected to review only the agency’s policy\ndetermination under the APA, it noted that “if the Commission had written its opinion in purely constitutional\n28\nterms, we would have no choice but to address the constitutional issue.”  Id. at 659.\n38\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 39 of 49\n1 The reason actually given in the administrative record for the rescission was DACA’s\n2 purported illegality.  The Attorney General’s letter and the Acting Secretary’s memorandum can\n3 only be reasonably read as stating DACA was illegal and that, given that DACA must, therefore,\n4 be ended, the best course was “an orderly and efficient wind-down process,” rather than a\n5 potentially harsh shutdown in the Fifth Circuit.  Nowhere in the administrative record did\n6 the Attorney General or the agency consider whether defending the program in court would\n7 (or would not) be worth the litigation risk.  The new spin by government counsel is a classic\n8 post hoc rationalization.  That alone is dispositive of the new “litigation risk” rationale.\n9 Significantly, the INA itself makes clear that once the Attorney General had determined\n10 that DACA was illegal, the Acting Secretary had to accept his ruling as “controlling.”  Section\nt 11 1103(a)(1) of Title 8, a provision that allocates immigration power and duties among the\nr\nu\no a 12 Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, provides that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 “determinations and rulings by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 controlling.”  Therefore, once the Attorney General advised the Acting Secretary that DACA\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 was illegal, that ruling became “controlling” upon her.  She had no choice other than to end\nS N 16 DACA.  She had no room to push back with arguments for the program, to weigh litigation risks,\nted  For the  17 or to consider whether DACA recipients warranted fighting for.  The ruling of law by the\ni\nn\nU\n18 Attorney General, controlling upon her, made all such considerations moot.  Therefore, the new\n19 spin by government counsel that the decisionmaker here indulged in a litigation risk assessment\n20 and, out of caution, chose not to fight for the program in favor of an orderly wind-down is\n21 foreclosed by the INA itself.  Her wind-down references plainly presuppose that DACA had to\n22 end and the only question was how.  \n23 Nevertheless, this order now indulges government counsel’s new explanation and\n24 addresses whether it holds up even if taken as authentic.  In that event, two major criticisms can\n25 and should be made of the “litigation risk management” rationale.  \n26 First, even as to the risk in the Fifth Circuit, the administrative record mentions only\n27 similarities between DAPA and DACA (and even then only in an exceedingly conclusory way). \n28 No mention appears concerning the differences between DAPA and DACA that might have led\n39\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 40 of 49\n1 to a different result.  In addition to the distinctions made above, one powerful consideration\n2 should have been the doctrine of laches.  Unlike the DAPA challenge filed immediately after\n3 DAPA was announced, the threatened DACA challenge by ten states would have come five\n4 years after the program began and after hundreds of thousands of young adults had enrolled and\n5 entered the workforce.  See Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967) (adopting\n6 laches in APA context); see also Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 (D.D.C. 2014),\n7 aff’d, 797 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that even if plaintiff did have standing he could not\n8 demonstrate irreparable harm since he waited two years to challenge DACA).  Another\n9 difference was that DACA was precisely the kind of interstitial program of deferred action\n10 seemingly approved even by the Fifth Circuit, Texas, 809 F.3d at 185, given that both sides of\nt 11 the aisle and our two most recent presidents have called for Dreamer legislation.  Nor was there\nr\nu\no a 12 any mention of our own circuit’s more recent decision in Brewer II that favored DACA, or of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 recognition by the district court in the District of Columbia that DACA had, contrary to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Fifth Circuit, involved discretionary denials of DACA relief.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Second, if we are to indulge the spin that the decision to end DACA rested on a\nS N 16 litigation-management assessment (rather than on a ruling of illegality), then the Acting\nted  For the  17 Secretary committed a serious error.  Against the litigation risk the Acting Secretary should\ni\nn\nU\n18 have — but did not — weigh DACA’s programmatic objectives as well as the reliance interests\n19 of DACA recipients.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126–27\n20 (2016).  This responsibility lay with the Acting Secretary, not the Attorney General.  That is,\n21 once the Acting Secretary was informed of the supposed litigation risk, it remained her\n22 responsibility to balance it against competing policy considerations.  It remained her\n23 responsibility to recognize the litigation risk, yet still ask whether the program was worth\n24 fighting for.  The administrative record is utterly silent in this regard.  \n25 The agency reversed over five years of DHS policy, did so only one day after the\n26 Attorney General’s letter, and did so just three months after Secretary Kelly had continued the\n27 program (despite the Fifth Circuit’s decision and affirmance).  The Acting Secretary failed to\n28 provide a “reasoned explanation” as to why she was “disregarding facts and circumstances\n40\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 41 of 49\n1 which underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations,\n2 Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009).  \n3 Encino Motorcars seems very close on point.  There, the Supreme Court addressed the\n4 Department of Labor’s reversal of an interpretive regulation construing the Fair Labor Standard\n5 Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions for car dealership employees.  Our court of\n6 appeals gave Chevron deference to the new interpretation.  The Supreme Court reversed. \n7 In determining whether the regulation was “procedurally defective” — and accordingly whether\n8 the agency’s regulation warranted Chevron deference — the Supreme Court evaluated whether\n9 the agency had given adequate reasons for its decision to reverse course.  Encino Motorcars,\n10 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., 463 U.S. at 43).  The Supreme Court\nt 11 explained (at page 2126) that while agencies are free to change their existing policies, they must\nr\nu\no a 12 provide a reasoned explanation for a change (quotes and citations omitted):\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In explaining its changed position, an agency must also be\ni C\ntr of  cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious\n Dis District  14 rite liisa nnocet  tihnatet rfeusrttsh ethr ajtu smtiufsict abteio tna kise nd einmtoan adcecdo ubnyt .t h Ien m suecreh  fcaacstes\ntates orthern  15 odfis preogliacryd icnhga nfagcet;s  bauntd t hcairtc au mresatsaonnceeds  ethxaptl aunnadteiorlna yis o nre wedeered for\nS N 16 engendered by the prior policy.

As there,\n23\nthe administrative record here includes no analysis of the “significant reliance issues involved.” \n24\nThe parallel is striking.  In terminating DACA, the administrative record failed to address the\n25\n689,800 young people who had come to rely on DACA to live and to work in this country. \n26\nThese individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government,\n27\npaid hefty fees, and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA.  The administrative\n28\n41\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 42 of 49\n1 record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA\n2 recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.17\n3 Ironically, government counsel now cite material outside of the administrative record in\n4 an attempt to show the Acting Secretary considered the plight of DACA recipients (Dkt. 204 at\n5 10, 12, 19–20).  This press release came after the fact and was not part of the administrative\n6 record, and therefore cannot now rescue the agency.  In that respect, Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n,\n7 No. 16-70481 at 17 n.4 is analogous.  There, our court appeals refused to consider an agency’s\n8 position which was not advanced in connection with the decision under review but, rather, was\n9 offered for the first time afterwards.  \n10 Defendants next argue that because no statute here dictated the factors for an agency to\nt 11 consider in granting or rescinding deferred action, the agency need not have given weight to the\nr\nu\no a 12 benefits of the DACA program or the harm that would be caused to its recipients upon its\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 rescission.  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that “[c]onsideration of cost reflects\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 advantages and the disadvantages of agency decision.”  Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct.\nS N 16 2699, 2707 (2015).  While defendants attempt to distinguish Michigan on the ground that the\nted  For the  17 text of the statute required regulation there to be “appropriate and necessary,” they ignore that a\ni\nn\nU\n18 change in agency policy requires the agency to have “good reasons for it.”  Fox TV Stations,\n19 Inc., 556 U.S. at 515.  \n20 Defendants, of course, are correct that when an agency reverses policy it “need not\n21 demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n22 reasons for the old one.”  Ibid.  Where, however, an agency abruptly changes course and\n23 terminates a program on which so many people rely, the APA requires “a more detailed\n24 justification.”  Ibid.  Indeed, “[i]t would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.” \n25 Ibid.  In such cases, “it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy\n26 change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that\n27\n17  Here, perhaps in light of Encino Motors, the government does not argue that Chevron deference\n28\nshould be afforded to the Attorney General’s legal conclusion that DACA exceeded the agency’s authority. \n42\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 43 of 49\n1 underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. at 515–16.  Defendants’ attempt to portray\n2 DACA as a program that did not generate reliance interests is unconvincing.  As plaintiffs’\n3 evidence shows, DACA recipients, their employers, their colleges, and their communities all\n4 developed expectations based on the possibility that DACA recipients could renew their deferred\n5 action and work authorizations for additional two-year periods.  \n6 In sum, government counsel’s alternative spin on the administrative record is just a post\n7 hoc rationalization.  But, even if it had been the actual rationale, it was arbitrary, capricious, and\n8 an abuse of discretion under Encino Motors.  \n9 *                         *                         *\n10 Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nt 11 claim that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \nr\nu\no a 12 B. Irreparable Harm.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated that they are likely to suffer serious irreparable harm\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 absent an injunction.  Before DACA, Individual Plaintiffs, brought to America as children, faced\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 a tough set of life and career choices turning on the comparative probabilities of being deported\nS N 16 versus remaining here.  DACA gave them a more tolerable set of choices, including joining the\nted  For the  17 mainstream workforce.  Now, absent an injunction, they will slide back to the pre-DACA era and\ni\nn\nU\n18 associated hardship.\n19 The University of California and other entity plaintiffs have also demonstrated that they\n20 face irreparable harm as they begin to lose valuable students and employees in whom they have\n21 invested, and that loss of DACA recipients from the workforce will have a detrimental impact on\n22 their organization interests, economic output, public health, and safety.  \n23 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “prolonged separation from family\n24 members” and “constraints to recruiting and retaining faculty members to foster diversity and\n25 quality within the University community” are harms which are not compensable with monetary\n26 damages and therefore weigh in favor of finding irreparable harm.  Hawaii v. Trump,\n27 No. 17-17168, 2017 WL 6554184, at *22 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017).  These showings accordingly\n28\n43\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 44 of 49\n1 demonstrate that preliminary relief is appropriate.  Ibid.; see also Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting,\n2 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).\n3 Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs are likely to suffer such harms.  Rather, they\n4 argue that these harms will not happen before the phase-out begins on March 5, 2018, the date\n5 by which the undersigned judge had wanted to present a final record and final decision for\n6 appellate review.  \n7 Delays in this case, however, have made it impossible to send a final judgment to our\n8 court of appeals by March 5.  To take only one example, it would be unfair to reach a conclusion\n9 without giving plaintiffs an opportunity to examine the complete administrative record. \n10 Government counsel, however, succeeded in obtaining an order from the Supreme Court\nt 11 postponing proceedings on completing the administrative record until after ruling on its\nr\nu\no a 12 FRCP 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  As a result, we have yet to receive a complete administrative\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 record.  Although plaintiffs are likely to prevail on even the truncated administrative record, as\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 set forth above, our appellate court might disagree with that conclusion or the agency might seek\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 to cure the flaws in its process via a fresh agency action.  Plaintiffs are entitled to learn of all\nS N 16 flaws, if any more there be, lurking in the whole record.  One such possibility suggested by\nted  For the  17 plaintiffs is that the rescission was contrived to give the administration a bargaining chip to\ni\nn\nU\n18 demand funding for a border wall in exchange for reviving DACA.  A presidential tweet after\n19 our hearing gives credence to this claim.  Another possibility raised by plaintiffs is racial animus. \n20 These theories deserve the benefit of the full administrative record.  It will be impossible to\n21 litigate this case to a fair and final conclusion before March 5.18 \n22\n23\n24\n25\n18  On December 29, 2017, President Trump tweeted:  “The Democrats have been told, and fully\n26\nunderstand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an\nEND to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.  We must protect our\n27\nCountry at all cost!” (Dkt. No. 227-2).  Plaintiffs separately request judicial notice of this tweet.  Defendants\nobject to judicial notice on various relevancy grounds, but do not argue that it is not properly subject to judicial\n28\nnotice under FRE 201 (Dkt. Nos. 227, 230).  Plaintiffs’ request is accordingly GRANTED.  \n44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 45 of 49\n1 C. Balance of Equities and Public Interest.\n2 On provisional relief motions, district judges must consider whether (or not) such relief\n3 would be in the public interest.  On this point, we seem to be in the unusual position wherein the\n4 ultimate authority over the agency, the Chief Executive, publicly favors the very program the\n5 agency has ended.  In September, President Trump stated his support for DACA, tweeting: \n6 “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who\n7 have jobs, some serving in the military?  Really! . . . .”  He has also called upon Congress to\n8 ratify DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n9 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” (App. 1958). \n10 For the reasons DACA was instituted, and for the reasons tweeted by President Trump,\nt 11 this order finds that the public interest will be served by DACA’s continuation (on the conditions\nr\nu\no a 12 and exceptions set out below).  Beginning March 5, absent an injunction, one thousand\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 individuals per day, on average, will lose their DACA protection.  The rescission will result in\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 hundreds of thousands of individuals losing their work authorizations and deferred action status. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 This would tear authorized workers from our nation’s economy and would prejudice their being\nS N 16 able to support themselves and their families, not to mention paying taxes to support our nation. \nted  For the  17 Too, authorized workers will lose the benefit of their employer-provided healthcare plans and\ni\nn\nU\n18 thus place a greater burden on emergency healthcare services.  \n19 On provisional relief motions, district judges must also weigh the balance of hardships\n20 flowing from a grant versus denial of provisional relief.  The hardship to plaintiffs need not be\n21 repeated.  The only hardship raised by defendants is interference with the agency’s judgment on\n22 how best to allocate its resources in keeping our homeland secure, as well as its judgment in\n23 phasing out DACA.  Significantly, however, the agency’s judgment here was not based on a\n24 policy change.  It was based on a mistake of law.  If the instant order is correct that DACA fell\n25 within the statutory and constitutional powers of the Executive Branch, then a policy supported\n26\n27\n28\n45\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 46 of 49\n1 as high up as our Chief Executive has been the victim of a colossal blunder.  A preliminary\n2 injunction will set that right without imposing any policy unwanted by the Executive Branch.19\n3 D. Scope of Provisional Relief. \n4 For the foregoing reasons, defendants ARE HEREBY ORDERED AND ENJOINED, pending\n5 final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis on\n6 the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on September 5, 2017,\n7 including allowing DACA enrollees to renew their enrollments, with the exceptions (1) that new\n8 applications from applicants who have never before received deferred action need not be\n9 processed; (2) that the advance parole feature need not be continued for the time being for\n10 anyone; and (3) that defendants may take administrative steps to make sure fair discretion is\nt 11 exercised on an individualized basis for each renewal application.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Nothing in this order prohibits the agency from proceeding to remove any individual,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 including any DACA enrollee, who it determines poses a risk to national security or public\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 safety, or otherwise deserves, in its judgment, to be removed.  Nor does this order bar the agency\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 from granting advance parole in individual cases it finds deserving, or from granting deferred\nS N 16 action to new individuals on an ad hoc basis.  \nted  For the  17 The agency shall post reasonable public notice that it will resume receiving DACA\ni\nn\nU\n18 renewal applications and prescribe a process consistent with this order.  The agency shall keep\n19 records of its actions on all DACA-related applications and provide summary reports to the\n20 Court (and counsel) on the first business day of each quarter.20  \n21\n22\n19  If a likelihood of irreparable injury is shown and an injunction is in the public interest, a preliminary\ninjunction is also appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits are raised\n23\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n632 F.3d 1127, 1134–35 (9th Cir. 2011).  Because plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of\n24\nirreparable injury and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffs’ favor, preliminary relief would also\nbe appropriate under this alternative standard of review.  \n25\n20  A mandatory injunction orders a responsible party to take action, while “[a] prohibitory injunction\n26\nprohibits a party from taking action and preserves the status quo pending a determination of the action on the\nmerits.”  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1060.  The relevant status quo is the legally relevant relationship between the\n27\nparties before the controversy arose.  Id. at 1061.  Here, plaintiffs contest the validity of defendants’ rescission\nof DACA, the status quo before which was that DACA was fully implemented.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’\n28\nrequested preliminary injunction is not mandatory.  But even if it were, plaintiffs have demonstrated that\nsufficiently serious irreparable harm would result to warrant even a mandatory injunction.  \n46\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 47 of 49\n1 By way of explanation, while plaintiffs have demonstrated that DACA recipients,\n2 as well as their families, schools, employers, and communities, are likely to suffer substantial,\n3 irreparable harm as a result of the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to\n4 individuals who have never applied for or obtained DACA.  \n5 This order will not require advance parole.  Unlike the widespread harm to plaintiffs and\n6 our economy that would result were the 689,800 DACA enrollees to lose their ability to work in\n7 this country, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that comparable harm will occur as a result of\n8 DACA recipients’ inability to travel abroad.  True, Individual Plaintiffs Jirayut Latthivongskorn\n9 and Norma Ramirez describe professional disadvantages that may result if they are unable to\n10 travel internationally.  These, however, do not amount to hardships justifying a provisional\nt 11 injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole.  However, as\nr\nu\no a 12 stated, nothing in this order would bar individuals from asking for such agency relief or bar the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 agency from granting it in deserving cases.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 With respect to geographical scope, this order finds a nationwide injunction is\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 appropriate.  Our country has a strong interest in the uniform application of immigration law\nS N 16 and policy.  Plaintiffs have established injury that reaches beyond the geographical bounds\nted  For the  17 of the Northern District of California.  The problem affects every state and territory of the\ni\nn\nU\n18 United States. \n19 In February 2017, our court of appeals considered this very issue in Washington v.\n20 Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017), and upheld a nationwide injunction imposed by a\n21 single district court, observing that limiting the geographic scope of an injunction on an\n22 immigration enforcement policy “would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory\n23 requirements for uniform immigration law and policy” and that, as here, “the government ha[d]\n24 not proposed a workable alternative.”  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion in\n25 determining the appropriate scope of an injunction over DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88,\n26\n27\n28\n47\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 48 of 49\n1 holding that uniform application of the immigration laws justified a nationwide injunction.  So\n2 too here.21\n3 Limiting relief to the States in suit or the Individual Plaintiffs would result in\n4 administrative confusion and simply provoke many thousands of individual lawsuits all over the\n5 country.  The most practical relief is to maintain DACA in the same manner to which the agency\n6 and recipients are accustomed, subject to the exceptions above noted.  \n7 CONCLUSION\n8 Defendants’ motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1) is GRANTED IN PART only to the\n9 limited extent stated above and is otherwise DENIED.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are\n10 hereby DISMISSED.  Maine or Minnesota may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR\nt 11 DAYS from the date of this order to file a motion, noticed on the normal 35-day track, for leave to\nr\nu\no a 12 file an amended complaint.  A proposed amended complaint must be appended to the motion and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 amendments to the complaint cure the deficiencies identified herein.  To the extent stated above,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief is GRANTED.  A separate order will address defendants’\nS N 16 motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6).\nted  For the  17 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\ni\nn\nU\n18 Pursuant to our court of appeals’ order dated December 21, 2017, the district court\n19 hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues decided herein (i) whether (or not) the\n20 rescission of DACA is unreviewable as committed to agency discretion or by reason of 8 U.S.C.\n21 § 1252(g), (ii) whether (or not) plaintiffs have standing, and (iii) all other questions interposed\n22 by the government in its motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1).  This order finds that these are\n23 controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and\n24\n25\n21  Oddly, the government’s contrary authority is Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169–70 (9th Cir.\n1987), a decision in which our court of appeals upheld a nationwide injunction and held, “[t]here is no general\n26\nrequirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit,” and “nationwide relief in federal district or\ncircuit court [is permitted] when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal merely observed that “[w]here relief can be\n27\nstructured on an individual basis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.”  Id. at 1170. \nHere, it cannot be so structured.  Nor are any of the government’s other authorities, which restate the general\n28\nproposition that a remedy should match the injury alleged, see, e.g., Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,\n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017), to the contrary. \n48\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 66   Filed 01/09/18   Page 49 of 49\n1 that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the litigation.  This order\n2 realizes that the same issues are reviewable upon appeal of this injunction.  Nevertheless, out of\n3 caution and to avoid any problem concerning scope of review, the district court so certifies.  \n4\n5 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n6\n7 Dated:  January 9, 2018.                                                             \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n8 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n9\n10\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n49",

(NRDC), a nonprofit \nadvocacy group with hundreds of thousands of members, litigates to \nprotect health and the environment, to vindicate its members’ rights, and \nto ensure the lawfulness and transparency of agency actions. Because \ncourts often review agency action on the “administrative record,” NRDC \nseeks to ensure that the records agencies submit to the courts completely \nand accurately reflect the agencies’ proceedings.1 \nINTRODUCTION \nWhether courts review the lawfulness of agency action based on the \n“whole record,” 5 U.S.C. § 706, or a partial, potentially sanitized record, is a \nquestion of profound significance to the functioning of our government. \nThe answer affects judges’ ability to fairly and accurately assess agency \ndecisions, and the public’s ability to check agency excesses in court. \nNRDC has litigated hundreds of record-review cases. Some of these \ncases have been prosecuted against federal agencies; others have been \n                                           \n1 No party’s counsel authored any part of this brief. No party or party’s \ncounsel contributed money intended to fund the preparation or submission \nof this brief. No person (other than amicus curiae, its members, or its \ncounsel) contributed money to fund any aspect of this brief. \n1 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 11 of 28\nlitigated alongside the government. The administrative records in record-\nreview cases often span tens of thousands, or sometimes more than a \nmillion, pages.2 There are many reasons for this: The work of regulatory \nagencies is nuanced, complex, and serious. Rulemakings often last years. \nAnd an administrative record, at its best, discloses all the evidence and \nargument before the agency, the considerations the agency weighed, and \nthe agency’s conclusions and reasoning.  \nThese issues are, after all, the issues that a reviewing court must \nevaluate. See, e.g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (“[T]he agency must examine the \nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action \nincluding a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.’” (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 \n(1962))). “To review less than the full administrative record might allow a \nparty to withhold evidence unfavorable to its case,” which would impede a \ncourt’s ability “to review an agency’s action fairly.” Walter O. Boswell Mem’l \n                                           \n2 See, e.g., Georgia ex rel. Olens v. McCarthy, 833 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. \n2016); Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Nat’l Oceanic & Atmospheric Admin., \n99 F. Supp. 3d 1033, 1044 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Bonnichsen v. United States, 217 \nF. Supp. 2d 1116, 1120 n.2 (D. Or. 2002). \n2 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 12 of 28\nHosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1984). And that risk would be \nmagnified if agencies could exclude documents they deemed privileged as \ndeliberative process without specifically asserting or justifying their claims.  \nCongress did not intend that result when it directed courts to review \nagency action on the “whole record.” 5 U.S.C. § 706. The deliberative-\nprocess privilege is a qualified, common-law protection intended “to \nprotect the quality of agency decisions.” FTC v. Warner Commc’ns Inc., 742 \nF.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984). But there are competing interests, manifest \nin the Administrative Procedure Act, “in opening for scrutiny the \ngovernment’s decision making process,” In re Franklin Nat’l Bank Sec. Litig., \n478 F. Supp. 577, 582 (E.D.N.Y. 1979), and “ensuring the rationality and \nfairness” of that decision making. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. SEC, 606 \nF.2d 1031, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 1979). For these reasons, “[a] litigant may obtain \ndeliberative materials if his or her need for the materials and the need for \naccurate fact-finding override the government’s interest in non-disclosure.” \nWarner Commc’ns, 742 F.2d at 1161. \nIf an agency wishes to assert the deliberative-process privilege to \nexclude documents from the record for judicial review, it must show why \nthe agency’s interest in the secrecy of specific documents outweighs \n3 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 13 of 28\n“society’s interest in the accuracy and integrity of factfinding, and the \npublic’s interest in honest, effective government.” Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep’t \nof Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 885 (1st Cir. 1995). Absent such a showing, \njudicial review on the “whole record” should proceed. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act requires \nthe litigants and the court to have access to the “whole” record of \nthe agency’s proceedings \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides for judicial review \nof agency action on “the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706. These words should be construed “with a view to their place \nin the overall statutory scheme.” Ariz. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n v. U.S. Fish & \nWildlife Serv., 273 F.3d 1229, 1241 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). \nUnder the APA’s arbitrary-or-capricious standard, see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), a court reviews the “whole record” to decide, among other \nthings, whether the agency based its decision on the relevant factors, see \nAriz. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n, 273 F.3d at 1236; explained its decision in a way \nthat “runs counter to the evidence before [it],” Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. \nat 43; or failed to offer a “rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made,” id. While this inquiry is circumscribed, courts’ review \n4 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 14 of 28\nmust be “searching and careful.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, \n401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). \nA court that does not have the whole record cannot “carefully \nreview[] the record and satisfy[] [itself] that the agency has made a \nreasoned decision based on [the agency’s] evaluation of the [evidence].” \nMarsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989). A court cannot, for \nexample, assess whether an agency decision “runs counter to the \nevidence,” Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43, without all the evidence. And \na court certainly cannot evaluate whether the agency based its decision on \nthe “relevant factors,” Ariz. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n, 273 F.3d at 1236—or on \nimpermissible ones, see D.C. Fed’n of Civic Assocs. v. Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, \n1249 (D.C. Cir. 1971)—without knowing what factors the agency weighed. \nTo fairly decide these questions, the reviewing court should “have \nbefore it neither more nor less information than did the agency when it \nmade its decision.” Walter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp., 749 F.2d at 792. Anything \n“less than the full administrative record might allow a party to withhold \nevidence unfavorable to its case.” Id. The agency could “skew the ‘record’ \nfor review in its favor by excluding from that ‘record’ information in its \nown files which has great pertinence to the proceeding in question.” Envtl. \n5 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 15 of 28\nDef. Fund, Inc. v. Blum, 458 F. Supp. 650, 661 (D.D.C. 1978). As this Court \nhas said, “[a]n incomplete record must be viewed as a ‘fictional account of \nthe actual decisionmaking process.’” Portland Audubon Soc’y v. Endangered \nSpecies Comm., 984 F.2d 1534, 1538 (9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). \nThe whole record is thus “everything that was before the agency \npertaining to the merits of its decision.” Id. at 1548 (citing Thompson v. U.S. \nDep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555-56 (9th Cir. 1989)); see also Bar MK Ranches \nv. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 739 (10th Cir. 1993) (“The complete administrative \nrecord consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly \nconsidered by the agency.”); Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644, 654 (2d \nCir. 1982) (holding that the “whole administrative record” includes the \nagency’s “informational base” when it made its decision). This is what the \nSupreme Court referred to in Camp v. Pitts, when it stated that “the focal \npoint for judicial review should be the administrative record already in \nexistence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.” 411 \nU.S. 138, 142 (1973) (per curiam). The record already in existence is “not \nnecessarily those documents that the agency has compiled and submitted as \n‘the’ administrative record.” Thompson, 885 F.2d at 556 (emphasis in \noriginal) (citation omitted). \n6 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 16 of 28\nTo the extent Defendants claim that the administrative record \nincludes only materials directly considered “by the decisionmaker,” Pet. 3, \nthey err. As this Court has explained, the “whole record” includes \nmaterials considered either “directly or indirectly” by the decisionmaker. Id. \nat 18 (quoting Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555). It is difficult to see what \n“indirect[] consider[ation]” could mean if it required that the ultimate \ndecisionmaker actually review the documents. \nNotwithstanding Defendants’ contrary suggestion, Thompson v. U.S. \nDepartment of Labor does not hold that the “record” of informal agency \nactions includes only materials transmitted to the ultimate decisionmaker. \nThe Thompson court reviewed an agency adjudication conducted pursuant \nto the APA’s special procedural safeguards for formal proceedings.3 See 885 \nF.2d at 555. Those safeguards, which do not apply to informal rulemakings, \ninclude a prohibition on ex parte communications, 5 U.S.C. § 557(d)(1)(A); a \nright to call and cross-examine witnesses, id. § 556(d); and transcribed \n                                           \n3 The APA’s formal procedural safeguards applied because Thompson \narose under a statute that required the agency to make its decision on the \nrecord after a hearing. 42 U.S.C. § 5851(b)(2)(A). This standard triggers the \nformal procedural safeguards set out in 5 U.S.C. §§ 556 & 557. See 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 553(a), 554. \n7 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 17 of 28\nhearings, id. § 556(e). The APA specifies that the “record” for such formal \nproceedings includes only the transcript, exhibits, and materials “filed in \nthe proceeding.” Id. None of these procedures apply to informal agency \naction. See id. § 553(c). \nOutside the formal adjudicative context, however, the administrative \nrecord necessarily encompasses the review and analysis of agency staff \nwho then digest the record and make recommendations to their leadership. \nThe decisionmaker “indirectly” considers this information through agency \nstaff. If courts could not consider the work those staff did—work that \ninforms summaries and recommendations sent to decisionmakers—then \nmuch of the basis for agency decisions would be hidden from judicial view. \nInformal agency proceedings, such as most rulemakings, may take \nmonths or years to complete. Vast administrative records are often \ncollected, see supra note 2, potentially including public comments,4 \ncommunications among or concerns voiced by the agency’s own staff,5 \n                                           \n4 See, e.g., Nw. Motorcycle Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 18 F.3d 1468, 1474 \n(9th Cir. 1994). \n5 See, e.g., Bonnichsen, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 1130; Nat. Res. Def. Council v. \nPritzker, 828 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir. 2016). \n8 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 18 of 28\nsister agencies’ viewpoints,6 scientific evaluations,7 and economic studies. 8 \nThe heads of federal agencies cannot practicably review and evaluate all \nthis material themselves. Yet, under Defendants’ theory, all such material, \nunless provided directly to the final decisionmaker, would be properly \nexcluded from the record for judicial review. That theory cannot be \nsquared with the courts’ routine reliance on such material in their \ndecisions. \nCourts need “a full-scale administrative record” to “dispel any \ndoubts about the true basis of [the agency’s] action.” D.C. Fed’n of Civic \nAssocs., 459 F.2d at 1249; accord Aera Energy LLC v. Salazar, 642 F.3d 212, 221 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). A “contrary approach” would “render judicial review \ngenerally meaningless” and contravene “the demand that courts ensure \nthat agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation ‘of the relevant \nfactors.’” Marsh, 490 U.S. at 378. Thus, if the record lodged by the agency in \n                                           \n6 See Pritzker, 828 F.3d at 1136-37 (referring to concern voiced by Marine \nMammal Commission). \n7 See, e.g., id. at 1136-40; W.

See Pub. Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 793-94 (9th Cir. \n1982) (Kennedy, J.). \nII.  If an agency wishes to exclude deliberative-process materials from \nan administrative record, it must justify the claim of privilege \nContrary to Defendants’ assertions, internal agency documents \ndisclosing the agency’s deliberations are not automatically excluded from \nthe administrative record. The deliberative-process privilege is a qualified, \ncommon-law privilege that must be justified on a document-by-document \nbasis. It does not trump Congress’s requirement that judicial review of \nagency action proceed on the “whole record.” 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nTo the contrary, judicial review under the APA almost invariably \nexamines the agency’s deliberative process. The reviewing court is called to \ndetermine whether the agency “failed to consider an important aspect of \nthe problem,” “offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to \nthe evidence before the agency,” or made no “rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43-44.  \nIn answering these questions, this Court routinely considers internal \nagency documents that evaluate evidence, make recommendations, reveal \n10 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 20 of 28\ndisagreements among staff, and otherwise disclose candid agency \ndeliberations; a few examples of this Court’s reliance on such material are \ncited in the margin.9 District courts routinely consider such material as \nwell.10 Candid, internal agency documents are a core part of the “whole \nrecord,” 5 U.S.C. § 706, and often critical to a “searching and careful” \njudicial inquiry. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416. \n                                           \n9 See, e.g., Pritzker, 828 F.3d at 1136-40 (agency scientists’ analysis and \nrecommendation); W.

See generally Assembly \nof Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 1992) (discussing \nscope of deliberative-process privilege). Defendants’ theory that the \nadministrative record does not include predecisional, deliberative material \nwould thus require this Court to depart sharply from past practice and \nprecedent. It would also require the Court to abandon its definition of the \n“whole record” as “everything that was before the agency pertaining to the \nmerits of its decision.” Portland Audubon Soc’y, 984 F.2d at 1548. \nNothing in the APA suggests that Congress intended the enfeebled \njudicial review that would flow from Defendants’ approach. The \ndeliberative-process privilege is a qualified privilege, and one created by \nthe courts. Warner Commc’ns, 742 F.2d at 1161; accord Landry v. FDIC, 204 \nF.3d 1125, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The doctrine protects agency documents \nfrom discovery “so that the public will benefit from more effective \ngovernment.” In re Franklin Nat’l Bank Sec. Litig., 478 F. Supp. at 582. \nThat justification is “attenuated,” however, when “the public’s \ninterest in effective government would be furthered by disclosure,” id., \nsuch as where a court reviews the agency action for lawfulness. After all, \n12 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 22 of 28\nCongress thought that the public interest would be best served by judicial \nreview on the “whole” record, 5 U.S.C. § 706—that is, “neither more nor \nless information than . . . the agency [had] when it made its decision.” \nWalter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp., 749 F.2d at 792. Thus, while the deliberative-\nprocess privilege has its place, the interests it serves do not outweigh a \ncourt’s need to consider materials “germane to the [agency] decision and \nnot duplicated elsewhere in the record.” Suffolk Cty. v. Sec’y of Interior, 562 \nF.2d 1368, 1384 (2d Cir. 1977); see In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated Aug. 9, \n2000, 218 F. Supp. 2d 544, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (“The deliberative process \nprivilege is qualified; it may be overcome by a showing of need . . . .”). \nThe divided decision in San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, 789 F.2d 26 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc), \nprovides no persuasive argument to the contrary. That case arose from a \nformal Nuclear Regulatory Commission adjudication. See id. at 29 (citing 42 \nU.S.C. § 2239(a)). To protect the “frank deliberations of Commission \nmembers,” the court refused to supplement the record with a transcript of \nthe Commissioners’ closed-door deliberations. 789 F.2d at 44; see also id. at \n45-46 (Mikva, J., concurring). That refusal is best understood as a \nparticularized determination that the deliberative-process concerns that \n13 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 23 of 28\nwould flow from disclosure of that transcript outweighed the need for \ndisclosure in that case. The court did not address the contents of \nadministrative records in informal agency proceedings, which do not afford \nsimilar procedural safeguards, see supra pp. 7-8, and which do not have the \nsame constraints on the “record,” 5 U.S.C. § 556(e). Nor did the court hold \nthat agencies may exclude deliberative-process materials from \nadministrative records on their own say-so, without producing a privilege \nlog and justifying the exclusion. \nThe possibility for mischief created by Defendants’ approach is \ndisturbing. Federal agencies often do include deliberative materials in their \nagency records, at least when they believe the materials will help them. For \nexample, in Epsilon Electronics, Inc. v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, the \nfederal agency included in the record and relied in court on an internal, \npredecisional agency memo analyzing the evidence before the agency. 857 \nF.3d 913, 928 (D.C. Cir. 2017). And in American Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, \nthe agency included in the administrative record a declaration of its \ndecisionmaker intended to explain his otherwise inadequately explained \ndecision. 269 F.3d 1077, 1082-83 (D.C. Cir. 2002). That is much like the sort \nof decisionmaker testimony that Defendants claim is impermissible in the \n14 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 24 of 28\npresent case. Allowing an agency to pick when deliberative materials are \nincluded or excluded from the record for judicial review would allow the \nagency to “withhold evidence unfavorable to its case,” Walter O. Boswell \nMem’l Hosp., 749 F.2d at 792, rendering judicial review ineffective. \nIf an agency seeks to withhold a document (or part of a document11) as \ndeliberative-process privileged, the court should require the agency to assert \nthe privilege as to each document. Privilege determinations are not so self-\nevident that an agency, defending a lawsuit, should be trusted to make the \ndetermination on its own, without disclosing to the parties or the court what \nis being withheld and why. A privilege log is essential to let the opposing \nparty and the court “determine whether specific items on the log are actually \nprivileged.”12 EEOC v. BDO USA, L.L.P., 856 F.3d 356, 364 (5th Cir. 2017). \nA privilege log alone is not enough, however. Since the deliberative-\nprocess privilege is qualified, the agency must also show, when it invokes \n                                           \n11 The deliberative-process privilege does not protect reasonably \nsegregable factual information. See Paisley v. CIA, 712 F.2d 686, 698 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983). \n12 Cases overruling agency deliberative-process privilege claims are \ncommon. See, e.g., Assembly of Cal., 968 F.2d at 920-23; Ocean Mammal Inst. v. \nGates, No. Civ. 07-00254, 2008 WL 2185180, at *14-16 (D. Haw. May 27, \n2008). \n15 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 25 of 28\nthe  privilege,  that  “the  consequences  of  disclosure  of  the  information,” \nNorthrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 751 F.2d 395, 405 n.11 (D.C. Cir. \n1984), outweigh the public interest in searching and accurate judicial review. \nSee Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416; Walter O. Boswell Mem’l \nHosp., 749 F.2d at 792; see also United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706 (1974) \n(rejecting  executive  privilege  claim  based  “solely  on  the  broad, \nundifferentiated  claim  of  public  interest  in  the  confidentiality  of  .  .  . \nconversations” between presidents and advisors). \nThe agency must make this showing through an affidavit of “the head \nof the department after actual personal consideration.” United States v. Rozet, \n183 F.R.D. 662, 665 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (holding that staff attorneys may not \ninvoke the privilege); see Northrop Corp., 751 F.2d at 405 n.11; United States v. \nReynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1953). If an agency does not make that showing, its \ndeliberative materials remain in the record, and must be produced to allow \neffective judicial review.13 \n                                           \n13 Defendants’ protests about depositions of high-ranking officials, Pet. \n16-17, 19-20, are not a basis to exclude deliberative-process materials from \nadministrative records. Whether discovery is appropriate and what an \nadministrative record includes are different questions, especially where the \ncomplaint alleges both record-review and non-record-review claims. \nDefendants’ suggestion, see id. at 19-20, that including deliberative-process \n16 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-1, Page 26 of 28\nCONCLUSION \nThe “whole record,” 5 U.S.C § 706, for judicial review includes all \nmaterial  considered  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  agency  decisionmaker, \nincluding  material  considered  by  subordinates.  If  an  agency  wishes  to \nexclude a document from an administrative record as deliberative-process \nprivileged, it must justify that assertion by producing a privilege log and \nshowing, with respect to each document, that the interests the privilege \nserves outweigh the need for accurate and meaningful judicial review. \n \nNovember 1, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Michael E.

(NRDC) respectfully moves \nfor leave to file an amicus curiae brief in support of Real Parties in Interest-\nPlaintiffs. Real Parties in Interest-Plaintiffs have consented to this motion. \nCounsel for Petitioners-Defendants has represented that her clients do not \noppose this motion.1 \nI.  NRDC’s Interests as Amicus \nFounded in 1970, NRDC is a nonprofit environmental and health \ngroup with hundreds of thousands of members throughout the United \nStates. NRDC’s staff of scientists, lawyers, and other professionals advance \nNRDC’s mission through analysis, public advocacy, and—when \nnecessary—litigation to vindicate NRDC’s members’ rights, enforce the \nlaw, and advance its mission. \nNRDC has litigated hundreds of cases involving claims against \nfederal agencies. Much of this litigation arises under statutes that require \njudicial review to be conducted on an administrative record. See, e.g., \n                                           \n1 No party’s counsel authored any part of the proposed amicus brief. No \nparty or party’s counsel contributed money intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of the brief. No person (other than amicus \ncuriae, its members, or its counsel) contributed money to fund any aspect \nof the brief. \n1 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-2, Page 4 of 7\n5 U.S.C. § 706. In some of that litigation, disputes have arisen about the \nproper scope of the administrative record. NRDC seeks leave to file this \namicus brief because it wishes to ensure that the administrative records \nthat agencies submit to the courts completely and accurately reflect agency \nproceedings. \nII.  Reasons Why NRDC’s Amicus Brief Is Desirable and Relevant \n  NRDC’s proposed amicus brief draws on NRDC’s nearly fifty years \nof experience with record-review litigation against federal agencies in \ndistrict and appellate courts to address two issues central to this \nmandamus proceeding: (1) Does the Administrative Procedure Act’s \nrequirement that judicial review be based on the “whole record,” or the \nparts cited by the parties, 5 U.S.C. § 706, generally require agency \nadministrative records to encompass all information directly and indirectly \nconsidered by the agency during the course of its proceeding? (2) When \nwithholding materials from the administrative record based on an \nassertion of the qualified deliberative-process privilege, must the \ngovernment identify the materials on a privilege log and justify its \nassertion of the qualified privilege through a declaration of the agency \nhead showing that the agency’s interest in nondisclosure of specific \n2 \n\n  Case: 17-72917, 11/01/2017, ID: 10640486, DktEntry: 26-2, Page 5 of 7\ndocuments or parts of documents outweighs the public interest in judicial \nreview based on the whole record? \nNRDC’s proposed amicus brief presents citations and analysis on \nboth questions that are different from those in the parties’ briefs. NRDC \ntherefore respectfully moves for leave to file its brief to assist the Court in \nreaching a just and accurate resolution. \n \nNovember 1, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Michael E.

We will therefore not be filing a \nrequest for review in the Supreme Court today, and we ask that the Court defer ruling \non the motion. We will advise the Court immediately of relevant developments. \n1. Citing its decision in Ellis v. U.S. Dist. Court, 360 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(en banc), this Court has inquired as to its jurisdiction to issue a stay pending Supreme \nCourt review. Ellis does not foreclose the exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction to \ncontinue the stay of proceedings that were the subject of the government’s mandamus \npetition. The Court in Ellis granted a writ of mandamus. Responding to a request to \nrecall the mandate, the Court explained that there was no mandate to recall because, \nin a mandamus proceeding, there is no mandate separate from the issuance of the \nwrit. That case has no bearing on the jurisdictional question presented here: whether, \nhaving exercised its mandamus jurisdiction and having denied the requested relief, the \nCourt retains authority under the All Writs Act to continue a previously granted stay \nof discovery and record expansion. See Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft v. U.S. Dist. Court \nfor Western Dist. of Oklahoma, 805 F.2d 340 (10th Cir. 1985) (recognizing that \nmandamus petition would be unsuccessful under court of appeals’ view of the law, \nbut staying district court order pending Supreme Court review).  \n2. The government has consistently urged that discovery and expansion of the \nadministrative record are neither necessary nor proper. Although plaintiffs have \n \n \n\nstrenuously urged to the contrary, they moved on November 19 for a stay of \ndiscovery and “record completion” in the district court pending a ruling on plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a preliminary injunction and the government’s motion to dismiss. Also on \nNovember 19, the government sought a stay in the district court pending possible \nSupreme Court review.    \nIn response, the district court on November 20 issued an order extending the \ntime for the government to file its administrative record until December 22, staying \ndiscovery until that date, and denying the government’s emergency motion for stay.  \nAs the government explained to the district court, this relief is insufficient: the \ngovernment will be required during the pendency of the stay to create an expanded \n“administrative record” that it continues to believe is legally improper for the reasons \nexpressed in its briefing to this Court and to produce that record a mere two days \nafter the hearing on the government’s motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs’ motion for \nprovisional relief.  \nThe parties are currently engaged in negotiations to address the government’s \nconcerns. In light of these developments, the government will not be seeking \nSupreme Court relief today, and, depending on the outcome of these discussions and \nsubsequent rulings of the district court, it may be unnecessary for this Court to act on \nour pending motion. Accordingly, we request that this Court delay resolution of this \nmotion pending further developments in the district court.  \n \n2 \n \n\n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  CHAD A.

No 79).  \n24\nOn October 18, federal defendants filed this motion seeking a stay of certain\n25\nproceedings — including all discovery and further proceedings concerning composition of the\n26\nadministrative record — pending resolution of a writ of mandamus appealing the October 17\n27\norder, which writ they will file with our court of appeals no later than October 20 (Dkt. No. 81). \n28\nAll parties stipulated to an expedited briefing schedule, pursuant to which plaintiffs filed a\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 33   Filed 10/19/17   Page 2 of 4\n1 response at 5:00 p.m. today.  With the benefit of the parties’ briefing, this order now DENIES\n2 federal defendants’ motion for a stay.   \n3 Whether to grant a stay is, in the first instance, in the discretion of the district court. \n4 Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009).  That discretion is guided by a four-factor test, under\n5 which courts consider:  “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\n6 likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a\n7 stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n8 proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Ibid. (citations and quotations omitted).  \n9 These factors do not favor our federal defendants.  The contentions federal defendants\n10 rely upon in arguing that they are likely to succeed on the merits are largely duplicative of their\nt 11 arguments opposing completion of the administrative record, which were rejected by the\nr\nu\no a 12 October 17 order.  For the same reasons set forth therein, these arguments remain unavailing. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Federal defendants additional arguments are likewise unpersuasive.  They offer a strained and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 inaccurate interpretation of 8 U.S.C. 1252(g) in support of their position that the decision to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 rescind DACA is unreviewable.  Section 1252(g), however, only bars judicial review of\nS N 16 decisions “by the Attorney General to [1] commence proceedings, [2] adjudicate cases, or [3]\nted  For the  17 execute removal orders,” none of which are at issue here.  This provision has been “narrowly\ni\nn\nU\n18 construed” and is plainly inapplicable to this action.  See Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373\n19 F.3d 952, 964 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor does federal defendants’ argument regarding the Court’s\n20 position on whether Acting Secretary Elaine Duke is subject to deposition — a topic not yet\n21 formally raised in this action or properly the subject of defendants’ mandamus petition — show\n22 that they are likely to succeed.       \n23   Most importantly, a stay will likely result in substantial and irreparable harm to our\n24 plaintiffs, and to those parties most interested in these proceedings, people who are currently\n25 enrolled in DACA.  All face a March 5, 2018 deadline, on which date the Department of\n26 Homeland Security has determined to end DACA.  On that day, people currently living and\n27 working in the United States will begin to lose the protections afforded by DACA.  The Court\n28 intends to reach a decision before the March 5 deadline, on a substantial and complete record,\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 33   Filed 10/19/17   Page 3 of 4\n1 which can be reviewed by our court of appeals, and has set a schedule that will accomplish this. \n2 A stay risks allowing this deadline to pass without a decision on the merits, and therefore poses\n3 a substantial threat to our plaintiffs and to DACA enrollees.  \n4 Moreover, any alleged “irreparable harm” imposed upon the government related to their\n5 discovery burden pales in comparison to that which will be faced by DACA enrollees.  Nor will\n6 privileged government communications be publicly disclosed, as the undersigned judge has\n7 reviewed, and as necessary will continue to review such documents, submitted in camera, and\n8 withhold from public view those that require withholding.  \n9 Finally, the public’s interest is best served by a thorough, transparent, and expeditious\n10 resolution of this litigation.  Federal defendants’ argument that this action and one other lawsuit\nt 11 pending in New York have diverted resources from the Department of Homeland Security’s\nr\nu\no a 12 mission of protecting the United States is not well taken.  The federal government is certainly\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 equipped to participate in this litigation and continue to perform its core functions.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Though federal defendants analyze their motion under the four-factor test set forth\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 above, they also suggest that a different test applies here since they seek to stay a proceeding as\nS N 16 opposed to only staying an order or judgment.  That test asks “whether (1) resolution by the\nted  For the  17 Ninth Circuit of the issue addressed in [the appealed order] could materially affect this case and\ni\nn\nU\n18 advance the ultimate termination of litigation and (2) whether a stay will promote [ ] economy\n19 of time and effort for the Court and the parties.”  American Hotel & Lodging Ass'n v. City of\n20 Los Angeles, No. CV 14-09603-AB (SSX), 2015 WL 10791930, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2015)\n21 (Judge Andre Birotte Jr.) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  \n22 This, however, is mere slight of hand.  Federal defendants are not seeking to stay “all\n23 proceedings in the DACA cases” as they state in their notice of motion (Dkt. No. 81 at 1), but\n24 rather are seeking to “stay discovery and further proceedings concerning the composition of the\n25 administrative record pending a ruling on [their] upcoming motion to dismiss” as they clarify in\n26 their memorandum of points and authorities (id. at 1–2).  In other words, they are moving to\n27 stay the October 17 order — a motion to which the four-part Nken test applies — while\n28 continuing to litigate only their affirmative case.  This is improper.   \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 33   Filed 10/19/17   Page 4 of 4\n1 Even under the test set forth in American Hotel & Lodging, however, defendants motion\n2 still fails.  First, a stay will not promote economy of time and effort.  In fact, it will have the\n3 opposite effect.  It will prolong proceedings and in all likelihood duplicate efforts by creating a\n4 delay, which requires litigation first on the issue of provisional relief followed by a second\n5 round of litigation on the merits.  This will result in a waste of time and resources.  \n6 Second, staying discovery and proceedings concerning composition of the\n7 administrative record will not advance the litigation.  An appellate decision on the composition\n8 of the administrative record can be made now or later, as our court of appeals prefers, but we\n9 ought to continue making progress on the merits while that court considers the issue.    \n10 For the foregoing reasons, federal defendants’ motion to stay proceedings is DENIED. \nt 11 This action shall continue on the schedule set forth in the September 22 Scheduling Order (Dkt.\nr\nu\no a 12 No. 49).  Even in the unfortunate event that the administrative record is not settled (due to\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 appellate proceedings), our briefing schedule will nevertheless allow an orderly assessment of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 whether or not provisional relief is warranted.        \n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 IT IS SO ORDERED.\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20 Dated:   October 19, 2017.                                                                \n21 WILLIAM ALSUP\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n4",

Federal defendants oppose.  For the reasons herein, plaintiffs’ motion is\n22\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security issued a\n25\nmemorandum promulgating a deferred action policy for those without lawful immigration status\n26\nwho came to the United States as children, were continuous residents in the United States for at\n27\nleast five years, had graduated from high school, obtained a GED, or served in the military, and\n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 2 of 14\n1 met certain other criteria — a memorandum and policy known as Deferred Action for\n2 Childhood Arrivals, “DACA” for short (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 1–3).1\n3 After the change in administrations in 2017, the new Secretary of DHS, John Kelly,\n4 announced that DACA would be continued notwithstanding the rescission of other immigration\n5 policies (id. at 230).  This was done despite, and with the knowledge of, the decision of the\n6 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015),\n7 invalidating a different deferred action policy and the Supreme Court’s affirmance of that\n8 decision by an equally divided vote, United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per\n9 curiam).\n10 On September 5, 2017, however, the Acting Secretary of DHS, Elaine Duke, reversed\nt 11 the agency’s position and announced DACA’s end, effective March 5, 2018. \nr\nu\no a 12 We now have five lawsuits in this district challenging that rescission.2  Each action is\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 proceeding on a parallel track and on the same schedule, which schedule was designed to reach\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a decision on the merits and to allow appellate review by the March 5 deadline.3    \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Pursuant to the scheduling order, the federal defendants filed the administrative record\nS N 16 on October 6.  It consisted of fourteen documents spanning 256 pages, each of which was\nted  For the  17 already available to the public, and had, in fact, already been filed in this action (Dkt. No. 49\ni\nn\nU\n18 ¶ 3; Dkt. No. 64-1).\n19 In unison, plaintiffs now move to require completion of the administrative record in\n20 accordance with Section 706 of Title 5 of the United States Code.  They argue that the current\n21 record is incomplete because it contains only documents personally considered by the Acting\n22 Secretary (and then only some considered by her) and excludes any and all other documents that\n23 indirectly led to the rescission. \n24\n25 1    All docket numbers herein refer to the docket in Case No. C 17-05211 WHA.\n26\n2   There are two additional DACA lawsuits proceeding in the Eastern District of New York before\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case\n27\nNo. 16-cv-04756 NGG.\n28\n3  The fifth lawsuit,  County of Santa Clara v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05813 HRL, was related after\nplaintiffs’ motion was fully briefed and argued.\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 3 of 14\n1 The federal defendants oppose, arguing that they have already filed a complete\n2 administrative record, which they contend is properly limited to unprivileged documents\n3 actually considered by the “decision-maker,” here, the Acting Secretary (Opp. at 8–9).  \n4 This order follows full briefing and oral argument and the Court’s review of all\n5 materials in camera that appeared on the government’s privilege log.\n6 ANALYSIS\n7 1. SCOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD.\n8 Section 706 of the APA provides that judicial review of agency action shall be based\n9 on “the whole record.”  The administrative record “is not necessarily those documents that the\n10 agency has compiled and submitted as the administrative record” but rather “consists of all\nt 11 documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and\nr\nu\no a 12 includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Thompson v. United States Dep’t of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555–56 (9th Cir. 1989).  This includes not only documents that “literally\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 pass[ed] before the eyes of the final agency decision maker” but also documents that were\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 considered and relied upon by subordinates who provided recommendations to the decision-\nS N 16 maker.  People of State of Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. United States Dep’t of Agriculture, Nos.\nted  For the  17 C05-3508 & C05-4038, 2006 WL 708914, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006) (Magistrate Judge\ni\nn\nU\n18 Elizabeth Laporte) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Amfac Resorts, L.L.C. v.\n19 United States Dep’t of the Interior, 143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (Judge Royce\n20 Lamberth).\n21 The requirement that a reviewing court consider “the whole record” before rendering a\n22 decision “ensures that neither party is withholding evidence unfavorable to its position and that\n23 the agencies are not taking advantage of post hoc rationalizations for administrative decisions. \n24 Walter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n25 While it is presumed that the administrative record submitted by defendants is complete,\n26 plaintiffs can rebut this presumption with “clear evidence to the contrary.”  Cook Inletkeeper v.\n27 EPA, 400 F. App’x 239, 240 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735,\n28 740 (10th Cir. 1993)). \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 4 of 14\n1 Defendants contend a showing of bad faith or impropriety is required in order to compel\n2 a complete production of the administrative record.  This is incorrect.  True, bad faith is one\n3 basis for requiring supplementation of an administrative record, but it is not the exclusive basis. \n4 Our court of appeals has repeatedly recognized other grounds for requiring supplementation,\n5 including where it appears the “agency relied on documents not [already] included in the\n6 record.”  Pub. Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 1982); Fence Creek\n7 Cattle Co. v. United States Forest Serv., 602 F.3d 1125, 1131 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Lands\n8 Council v. Powell, 395 F.3d 1019, 1030 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n9 The “bad faith” standard of Overton Park applies where, though an administrative\n10 record exists, plaintiffs ask to go beyond the record that was before the agency and inquire into\nt 11 the thought processes of decision-makers —  in Overton Park, by taking the testimony of\nr\nu\no a 12 agency officials.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Our plaintiffs are not seeking materials beyond what were already considered, directly\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 or indirectly, by the decision-maker, and therefore need not show bad faith.  Supplementation\nS N 16 is appropriate if they show, by clear evidence, that the agency relied on materials not already\nted  For the  17 included in the record.  See Portland Audubon Soc. v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d\ni\nn\nU\n18 1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993) (distinguishing between materials “never presented to the agency”\n19 and materials that were “allegedly [] before the agency”); Fence Creek Cattle Co., 602 F.3d at\n20 1131.  \n21 Nor is defendants’ contention that it need only produce documents directly considered\n22 by the Acting Secretary correct.  Documents reviewed by subordinates, or other agencies\n23 who informed her on the issues underlying the decision to rescind DACA, either verbally or\n24 in writing, should be in the administrative record.  See Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *2. \n25 The threshold question is whether plaintiffs have shown, by clear evidence, that the record\n26\n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 5 of 14\n1 defendants produced is missing documents that were considered, directly or indirectly, by DHS\n2 in deciding to rescind DACA.4 \n3 2. PLAINTIFFS’ SHOWING OF INCOMPLETENESS.\n4 Here, the tendered administrative record consists merely of fourteen documents\n5 spanning 258 pages, which defendants contend constitute the entire record considered in\n6 making the decision to rescind DACA.  These are plainly pertinent materials, although all were\n7 publicly known and already part of the pleadings herein.   \n8 Plaintiffs seek additional materials including emails, departmental memoranda, policy\n9 directives, meeting minutes, materials considered by Secretary Duke’s subordinates,\n10 communications from White House officials or staff, communications from the Department of\nt 11 Justice, and communications between DHS and state authorities, which they contend should\nr\nu\no a 12 necessarily be part of the administrative record (Br. at 9–10).  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs drew this list, in part, from a United States Department of Justice Guidance,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 which sets forth non-binding recommendations for how to compile an administrative record and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 what to include.  United States Dep’t of Justice, Env’t and Nat. Res. Div., Guidance to Federal\nS N 16 Agencies on Compiling the Administrative Record (Jan. 1999).  Specifically, the Guidance\nted  For the  17 states that the administrative record should “[i]nclude all documents and materials prepared,\ni\nn\nU\n18 reviewed, or received by agency personnel and used by or available to the decision-maker,\n19 even though the final decision-maker did not actually review or know about the documents\n20 and materials.”  Id. at 3.  It further provides that the record should include “communications\n21 the agency received from other agencies . . . documents and materials that support or oppose\n22 the challenged agency decision . . . minutes of meetings or transcripts thereof . . . [and]\n23\n24\n25\n4   Defendants also argue that they should not be required to produce any administrative record\nwhatsoever because the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end DACA was an exercise of\n26\nprosecutorial discretion not subject to judicial review (Opp. at 1).  Earlier in these actions, our defendants\nagreed to produce the administrative record by October 6, and were then ordered to do so.  They may not now\n27\nrenege on that commitment.  At this stage, defendants are required to produce an administrative record.  Should\nthey prevail on this argument on their eventual motion to dismiss, it will be with the benefit of a proper\n28\nadministrative record.  \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 6 of 14\n1 memorializations of telephone conversations and meetings, such as memorandum or\n2 handwritten notes.”5  \n3 Plaintiffs contend that communications from DOJ and the White House are a critical\n4 part of “the whole record” due to their significant public participation in the process of\n5 rescinding DACA.  Plaintiffs first point to Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter,\n6 which DHS expressly relied upon in its memorandum terminating the program (see Dkt. No.\n7 64-1 at 251, 255).  Despite this critical and publicly disclosed role in the decision, the only DOJ\n8 document defendants include in the record is this one-page September 4 letter.  This, plaintiffs\n9 contend, is clear evidence that defendants omitted documents supporting (or contradicting) the\n10 opinions set forth in Attorney General Sessions’ letter, in particular the opinion that DACA was\nt 11 unlawfully implemented.    \nr\nu\no a 12 Additionally, the White House has repeatedly emphasized the President’s direct role\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 in decisions concerning DACA.  For example, a September 5 White House press release\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 announced “President Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration” by rescinding DACA, and repeatedly stated that “President Trump” had acted to\nS N 16 end the program.   Press Release, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, President\nted  For the  17 Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to Immigration (Sept. 5, 2017),\ni\nn\nU\n18 https://www.whitehouse.gov/thepress-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-\n19 responsibility-and-rule-law.  Other articles likewise emphasize White House officials’ roles\n20 in decision-making regarding DACA.  See, e.g., Michael D. Shear & Julie Hirschfeld Davis,\n21 Trump Moves to End DACA and Calls on Congress to Act, New York Times (Sept. 5, 2017). \n22 Moreover, defendants concede in their response that Secretary Duke “received advice from\n23 other members of the executive branch” in making her decision (Opp. at 17) and refer to “White\n24 House memorandum” in their privilege log (Dkt. No. 71-2).  And at oral argument, counsel for\n25\n5  A 2008 DOJ memorandum specifically notes that the 1999 Guidance is a non-binding internal\n26\ndocument, which does not “limit the otherwise lawful prerogatives of the Department of Justice or any other\nfederal agency” (Dkt. No. 71-1 at 3).  In particular, the 2008 memorandum takes issue with outside parties’ use\n27\nof the Guidance in litigation to advocate for a particular composition of the administrative record or process for\nits assembly (ibid.).  Recognizing that the 1999 Guidance is not binding upon agencies, this order finds that the\n28\nGuidance nevertheless provides helpful insight into the types of documents and materials an agency should\nconsider when assembling an administrative record.   \n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 7 of 14\n1 defendants said it was likely Secretary Duke had received verbal input before making her\n2 decision.  Despite this, defendants have failed to provide even a single document from any\n3 White House officials or staff. \n4 Plaintiffs further observe that not a single document from one of Secretary Dukes’\n5 subordinates is in the record.  It strains credulity to suggest that the Acting Secretary of DHS\n6 decided to rescind a program covering 800,000 enrollees without consulting one advisor or\n7 subordinate within DHS.  Again, at oral argument, government counsel represented that she\n8 had likely received verbal input.  The government’s in camera submission confirms that she\n9 did receive substantial DACA input.      \n10 Finally, former DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum in February 2017,\nt 11 in which he rescinded all DHS memoranda that conflicted with newly stated immigration\nr\nu\no a 12 enforcement policies — but expressly declined to rescind DACA  (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 229–30). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 This decision, of course, is directly contrary to that taken by Acting Secretary Duke seven\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 months later.  The administrative record, however, omits all materials explaining the change\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 in position from February to September, with two exceptions — (1) a June 29 letter from Ken\nS N 16 Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, to Attorney General Sessions, in which he threatens\nted  For the  17 to amend the suit challenging DAPA to also challenge DACA if it is not rescinded by\ni\nn\nU\n18 September 5, and (2) Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter to Secretary Duke\n19 expressing the opinion that DHS should rescind DACA.  Reasoned agency decision-making\n20 ordinarily “demand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it is changing position” and\n21 “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n22 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Accordingly, “the whole record” would ordinarily contain materials\n23 giving a “reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding the facts and circumstances that underlay or\n24 were engendered by the prior policy.”  Ibid.  It is simply not plausible that DHS reversed policy\n25 between February and September because of one threatened lawsuit (never actually filed)\n26 without having generated any materials analyzing the lawsuit or other factors militating in favor\n27 of and against the switch in policy.         \n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 8 of 14\n1 Based on the foregoing, plaintiffs have clearly shown that defendants excluded highly\n2 relevant materials from the administrative record and in doing so have rebutted the presumption\n3 that the record is complete.\n4 Defendants’ argument to the contrary is unpersuasive.  Their position that only selected\n5 documents that Acting Secretary Duke personally reviewed need be part of the administrative\n6 record must yield to legal authority requiring both directly and indirectly considered documents\n7 be included in the record, see, e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555–56, and by public statements\n8 illustrating both DOJ and the White House’s direct involvement in the decision to rescind\n9 DACA.  The rule that government counsel advocates would allow agencies to contrive a record\n10 that suppresses information actually considered by decision-makers and by those making\nt 11 recommendations to the decision-makers, information that might undercut the claimed rationale\nr\nu\no a 12 for the decision.   \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 As stated, privilege log entries reveal several documents that were considered in arriving\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 at the decision to rescind DACA.  For example, at least seven entries refer to commentary in\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 media articles regarding DACA.  At oral argument, government counsel admitted that the\nS N 16 Acting Secretary had seen several media items on the issue.  There were not, however, any\nted  For the  17 media articles on DACA in the administrative record, but those that came to the Acting\ni\nn\nU\n18 Secretary should, of course, be included.6 \n19 Here, plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of completeness.  It is evident that Acting\n20 Secretary Duke considered information directly, or indirectly, through the advice of other\n21 agencies and others within her own agency.  These documents, as set forth in detail below,\n22 should be made part of the administrative record and must be produced by defendants in an\n23 amended administrative record by NOON ON OCTOBER 27.\n24\n6  Many documents were evidently excluded in their entirety based on an assertion of “deliberative-\n25\nprocess” privilege.  Any “[f]actual portions of documents covered by the deliberative process privilege,\n[however], must be segregated and disclosed unless they are so interwoven with the deliberative material” that\n26\nthey are not segregable.  See Pac. Fisheries, Inc. v. United States, 539 F.3d 1143, 1148 (9th Cir 2008) (citations\nand quotations omitted).  Accordingly, to the extent that media articles or other non-privileged factual materials\n27\nwere considered, they should have been included in the administrative record, and shall be filed as part of the\namended administrative record, even if passages are redacted as deliberative, and called out as such in the\n28 privilege log.  \n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 9 of 14\n1 3. WAIVER OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. \n2 Plaintiffs next argue that defendants have waived attorney-client privilege because they\n3 have put their attorneys’ legal opinions at issue by arguing that the rescission was required due\n4 to concerns over DACA’s legality (Br. at 15–16).  Indeed, one of DHS’s primary rationales for\n5 rescinding DACA was its purported illegality (see Dkt. No. 64-1 at 253–56 (Rescission\n6 Memorandum)).  \n7 Parties are not permitted to advance conclusions that favor their position in litigation,\n8 and at the same time shield the information that led to those conclusions from discovery. \n9 See Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 1992).  Put differently, “[t]he\n10 privilege which protects attorney-client communications may not be used both as a sword and a\nt 11 shield.”   Ibid.  Where a party raises a claim, which in fairness to its adversary requires it to\nr\nu\no a 12 reveal the information or communication that claim is predicated upon, it has implicitly waived\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 any privilege over that communication.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Here, defendants argue that DHS had to rescind DACA because it exceeded the lawful\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authority of the agency.  They cannot, therefore, simultaneously refuse to disclose the legal\nS N 16 research that led to that conclusion.  Defendants indeed, have included the September 4 legal\nted  For the  17 opinion of the Attorney General, pithy as it may be — yet they seek to conceal all other legal\ni\nn\nU\n18 analysis available to the Acting Secretary and to the Attorney General.   \n19 Significantly, defendants slide into a backup argument that the agency’s legal worry was\n20 “reasonable” even if wrong.  If this backup argument comes into play (as government counsel\n21 posits) then the “reasonableness” of taking an incorrect legal position would heavily turn on the\n22 underlying legal analysis so far withheld from view.   In other words, assessing the\n23 reasonableness of the Secretary’s legal rationale would turn, in part, on how consistent the\n24 analysis has been in the runup to the rescission.\n25 Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  They first argue, without citation\n26 to any legal authority, that “[w]ere plaintiffs’ argument accepted, the government would be\n27 deemed to have waived all privileges any time an assessment of the legal landscape informed an\n28 agency’s decisionsmaking” (Opp. at 21).  This argument vastly exaggerates plaintiffs’ position,\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 10 of 14\n1 and misrepresents the position defendants have staked out in this litigation.  DHS specifically\n2 relied upon DOJ’s assessment that DACA “was effectuated . . . without proper statutory\n3 authority,” “was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch” and “has\n4 the same legal and constitutional defects that courts recognized as to DAPA” (Dkt. No. 64-1 at\n5 254).  Plaintiffs are entitled to challenge whether this was a reasonable legal position and thus a\n6 reasonable basis for rescission.  In making that challenge, plaintiffs are entitled to review the\n7 internal analyses that led up to this change in position.        \n8 Defendants further argue that the decisions cited by plaintiffs are inapplicable because\n9 they arose in different contexts than the present action.  True, the decisions plaintiffs cite did\n10 not arise in identical circumstances.  E.g. Chevron Corp., 974 F.2d at 1162 (defendant\nt 11 prohibited from relying on legal opinion that tax position was reasonable while refusing to\nr\nu\no a 12 disclose the attorney communications leading to that conclusion).  They still, however, stand for\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the widely-accepted proposition that it is unfair for a litigant to defend his action with a\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 selective disclosure of evidence.  This principle carries no less force here.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In the related context of FOIA, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that\nS N 16 “the attorney-client privilege may not be invoked to protect a document adopted as, or\nted  For the  17 incorporated by reference into an agency’s policy.”  Nat’l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of\ni\nn\nU\n18 Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 360 (2d Cir. 2005).  There, DOJ invoked the reasoning of an OLC\n19 memorandum to justify its new position on an immigration issue.  Id. at 357.  The court held\n20 that the agency’s “view that it may adopt a legal position while shielding from public view the\n21 analysis that yielded that position is offensive to FOIA.”  Id. at 360.  So too here.     \n22 Defendants have waived attorney-client privilege over any materials that bore on\n23 whether or not DACA was an unlawful exercise of executive power and therefore should be\n24 rescinded. \n25 4. DELIBERATIVE-PROCESS PRIVILEGE BALANCING.\n26 Defendants further assert the deliberative-process privilege over many documents.  \n27 The deliberative-process privilege, however, is qualified and will yield when the need\n28 for materials and accurate fact-finding “override the government’s interest in non-disclosure.” \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 11 of 14\n1 F.T.C. v. Warner Commc’ns Inc., 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984).  “Among factors to\n2 be considered in making this determination are:  (1) the relevance of the evidence; (2) the\n3 availability of other evidence; (3) the government’s role in the litigation; and (4) the extent to\n4 which disclosure would hinder frank and independent discussion regarding contemplated\n5 policies and decisions.”  Ibid.  \n6 As set forth below, the judge has personally reviewed in camera all materials on the\n7 privilege log and applied the foregoing test to each document for which the deliberative-process\n8 privilege is claimed.7\n9 5. PRIVILEGE LOG REQUIREMENT.\n10 While defendants did not file a privilege log with their original production, they have\nt 11 since, pursuant to order, filed a privilege log claiming attorney-client or deliberative-process\nr\nu\no a 12 privilege over 84 documents considered by Secretary Duke but not included in the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 67; 71-2).  Nevertheless, defendants argue that privilege logs\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 are not generally required in connection with an administrative record and that one should not\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 be required here.    \nS N 16   Our court of appeals has not spoken on the issue.  Every court in this district\nted  For the  17 considering the issue, however, has required administrative agencies to provide a privilege log. \ni\nn\nU\n18 See, e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15CV01590HSGKAW, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5\n19 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2017) (Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore) (“[C]ourts in this district have\n20 required parties withholding documents on the basis of the deliberative process privilege to, at a\n21 minimum, substantiate those claims in a privilege log.”); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No.\n22 16-CV-01574-VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017) (Judge Vince Chhabria);\n23 Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *4.  \n24\n25\n26\n27\n7  Although not addressed in the brief or at oral argument, the privilege log referenced personal privacy\nand executive privilege objections for certain documents.  No substantial privacy interest is implicated in any of\n28\nthe documents ordered to be produced below, nor do any of these documents fall within the executive privilege.  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 12 of 14\n1 “If a privilege applies, the proper strategy isn’t pretending the protected material wasn’t\n2 considered, but withholding or redacting the protected material and then logging the privilege.” \n3 Inst. for Fisheries Res., 2017 WL 89002 at *1.8 \n4 Courts outside this district that have determined no privilege log was required have done\n5 so on the grounds that the defendants’ judgment of what constitutes the administrative record is\n6 entitled to a presumption of correctness.  See San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell,\n7 No. 115CV01290LJOGSA, 2016 WL 3543203, at *19 (E.D. Cal. June 23, 2016) (Judge\n8 Lawrence O’Neill); Nat’l Ass’n of Chain Drug Stores v. United States Dep't of Health &\n9 Human Servs., 631 F. Supp. 2d 23, 27 (D.D.C. 2009).  Here, however, that presumption has\n10 been overcome by plaintiffs’ showing that defendants failed to include documents considered in\nt 11 arriving at the final decision to rescind DACA in the administrative record.  Therefore, even\nr\nu\no a 12 applying those courts’ logic, a privilege log would still be appropriate here.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Going forward, defendants shall comply with the standing order in this case and provide\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a privilege log for all documents withheld on grounds of privilege, which log shall include all\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authors and recipients of privileged documents, as well as other information set forth in the rule\nS N 16 (see Dkt. No. 23 ¶ 18).\nted  For the  17 RELIEF ORDERED\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ motion to complete the administrative record is GRANTED to the extent now\n19 stated.  Defendants are directed to complete the administrative record by adding to it all emails,\n20 letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions and other materials directly or indirectly\n21 considered in the final agency decision to rescind DACA, to the following extent:  (1) all\n22 materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by Acting Secretary Duke in connection\n23 with the potential or actual decision to rescind DACA (except as stated in the next paragraph\n24 below), (2) all DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the government)\n25 who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with written advice or input regarding the\n26\n8   In a memorandum opinion, our court of appeals denied a plaintiff’s request to require a privilege log. \n27\nSee Cook Inletkeeper v. EPA, 400 F. App'x 239,  240 (2010).  In that decision, however, our court of appeals\nfirst denied a motion to supplement the record, and finding that the plaintiffs had not presented evidence that the\n28\nagency had considered the documents the plaintiffs sought to compel, only then denied the accompanying\nmotion for preparation of a privilege log without further explanation.  \n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 13 of 14\n1 actual or potential rescission of DACA, (3) all DACA-related materials considered by persons\n2 (anywhere in the government) who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with verbal input\n3 regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA, (4) all comments and questions\n4 propounded by Acting Secretary Duke to advisors or subordinates or others regarding the actual\n5 or potential rescission of DACA and their responses, and (5) all materials directly or indirectly\n6 considered by former Secretary of DHS John Kelly leading to his February 2017 memorandum\n7 not to rescind DACA.\n8 The undersigned judge has balanced the deliberative-process privilege factors and\n9 determined in camera that the following materials from the government’s in camera\n10 submission, listed by tab number, shall be included in the administrative record: 1–6, 7 (only\nt 11 the header and material on pages 3–4 concerning DACA), 12, 14, 17–25, 27–30, 36, 39, 44, 47,\nr\nu\no a 12 49 (only the first paragraph, and the paragraph captioned “General”), 69–70, 73–74, 77, 79, 81,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 84.  The remainder of the in camera submission need not be included. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 If the government redacts or withholds any material based on deliberative-process, or\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 any other privilege in its next filing, it shall simultaneously lodge full copies of all such\nS N 16 materials, indicating by highlighting (or otherwise) the redactions and withholdings together\nted  For the  17 with a log justification for each.  The judge will review and rule on each item.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ insistence that defendants scour the Department of Justice and the White\n19 House for documents for inclusion in the administrative record is overruled except to the\n20 limited extent that DOJ or White House personnel fall within the category described in the first\n21 paragraph above as someone who gave verbal or written input to the Acting Secretary.  Nor do\n22 defendants have to search for DACA materials below the agency levels indicated in the first\n23 paragraph above.  These are intended as practical limits on what would otherwise be a bone-\n24 crushing expedition to locate needles in haystacks. \n25 This order, however, is not intended to limit the scope of discovery (as opposed to the\n26 scope of the administrative record).  The scope of discovery over and above the administrative\n27 record continues to be managed by Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim. \n28\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 30   Filed 10/17/17   Page 14 of 14\n1 The federal defendants shall file an amended administrative record in conformity with\n2 this order by NOON ON OCTOBER 27.   \n3 If any party plans to seek a writ of mandate and wants a stay pending appellate review,\n4 then a fresh motion to that effect must be made very promptly.\n5\n6 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n7\n8 Dated: October 17, 2017.                                                                  \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n9 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n14",

Decided December 20, 2017\n  PER CURIAM. \n  This case arises from five related lawsuits that chal-\nlenge a determination adopted by the Acting Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The deter-\nmination, announced by the Acting Secretary, is to take \nimmediate steps to rescind a program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, by March 5, 2018.  \nThe Acting Secretary stated that her determination was \nbased in part on the Attorney General’s conclusion that \nDACA is unlawful and likely would be enjoined in poten-\ntially imminent litigation. \n  The five suits were filed in the United States District \nCourt  for  the  Northern  District  of  California,  and  the \nplaintiffs in those actions are the respondents in the mat-\nter now before this Court.  The defendants in the District \nCourt,  and  the  petitioners  here,  include  the  Govern- \nment of the United States, the Acting Secretary, and the \nPresident of the United States, all referred to here as the \nGovernment. \n  In the District Court litigation respondents argue that \nthe Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA in \nthe near future is unlawful because, among other reasons, \nit violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including \nthe equal protection guarantee implicit in that Clause. \n  The issue to be considered here involves respondents’ \ncontention that the administrative record the Government \nfiled to support the Acting Secretary’s determination to \nrescind DACA is incomplete.  The record consists of 256 \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,2 192-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 6833 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  22  ooff  44\n2  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \npages of documents, and the Government contends that it \ncontains all of the nondeliberative material considered by \nthe  Acting  Secretary  in  reaching  her  determination.  \n(Nearly  200  pages  consist  of  published  opinions  from \nvarious federal courts.) \n  On  October  17,  the  District  Court,  on  respondents’ \nmotion, ordered the Government to complete the adminis-\ntrative record.  See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Department \nof Homeland Security, App. C to Pet. for Mandamus, 2017 \nWL 4642324 (ND Cal., Oct. 17, 2017) (District Court Or-\nder).  The details of that order are recounted further be-\nlow.  See infra, at 3. \n  The Government petitioned for a writ of mandamus in \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of \nAppeals, in a divided opinion, denied the Government’s \npetition.  See 875 F. 3d 1200 (2017). \n  On November 19, three days after the Court of Appeals \nissued its opinion, respondents moved the District Court \nto stay its order requiring completion of the administra-\ntive  record  until  after  the  District  Court  resolved  the \nGovernment’s motion to dismiss and respondents’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Motion to Stay in No. \n17–cv–5211 (Nov. 19, 2017), Doc. 190.  The District Court \ndid  not  grant  respondents’  request,  instead  staying  its \norder for one month. \n  Still objecting to the District Court’s order, the Govern-\nment now seeks relief in this Court.  It has filed here a \npetition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court, or, \nin the alternative, for a writ of certiorari to the Court of \nAppeals. \n  The Court now grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, \nvacates the order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, and remands the case. \n  The District Court’s October 17 order requires the Gov-\nernment  to  turn  over  all  “emails,  letters,  memoranda, \nnotes, media items, opinions and other materials” that fall \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,2 192-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 6833 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  33  ooff  44\n  Cite as: 583 U.

Under the specific facts of this \ncase, the District Court should have granted respondents’ \nmotion  on  November  19  to  stay  implementation  of  the \nchallenged October 17 order and first resolved the Gov-\nernment’s  threshold  arguments  (that  the  Acting  Secre-\ntary’s  determination  to  rescind  DACA  is  unreviewable \nbecause it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act \ndeprives the District Court of jurisdiction).  Either of those \narguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for \nthe District Court to examine a complete administrative \nrecord.  \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,2 192-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 6833 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  44  ooff  44\n4  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \n  On remand of the case, the Court of Appeals shall take \nappropriate  action  so  that  the  following  steps  can  be \ntaken.  The District Court should proceed to rule on the \nGovernment’s threshold arguments and, in doing so, may \nconsider  certifying  that  ruling  for  interlocutory  appeal \nunder 28 U. S. C. §1292(b) if appropriate.   Thereafter, the \nCourt of Appeals or the District Court in the first instance \nmay consider whether narrower amendments to the record \nare necessary and appropriate.  In any event, the District \nCourt  may  not  compel  the  Government  to  disclose  any \ndocument  that  the  Government  believes  is  privileged \nwithout first providing the Government with the oppor-\ntunity to argue the issue. \n  This order does not suggest any view on the merits of \nrespondents’ claims or the Government’s defenses, or that \nthe District Court’s rulings on the Government’s motion to \ndismiss and respondents’ motion for preliminary injunc-\ntion should be delayed. \n  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth \nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nIt is so ordered.

Add.1.  We respectfully ask that the Court hold this petition in abeyance \npending resolution, including any Supreme Court review, of related expedited appeals \ncurrently before the Court, which raise threshold issues that, if resolved in the \ngovernment’s favor, could moot the issues raised in this petition.  \nSTATEMENT OF CONTROLLING QUESTIONS OF LAW \nPlaintiffs in these five consolidated suits challenge the decision of the Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security to wind down the discretionary immigration non-\nenforcement policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The \ngovernment has appealed the district court’s grant of a preliminary nationwide \ninjunction reinstating in large part the DACA policy.  The government has also \nappealed the district court’s partial denial of its motion to dismiss pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(b). Those consolidated appeals are currently pending before this Court; \nbriefing is set to close on April 17, with oral argument to be held in May.  \nOn March 8, 2018, the district court entered an order requiring the government \nto produce an expanded administrative record and privilege log, but ordered that \nthose requirements only take effect after the resolution of the appeals currently \npending before this Court. Add.1. The Court also sua sponte certified its order for this \nCourt’s interlocutory review.  The controlling question of law presented in the district \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 3 of 25\n \ncourt’s March 8, 2018 order is whether the district court may require expansion of the \nadministrative record beyond that produced by the agency, including through the \naddition of deliberative, pre-decisional documents, where there has been no showing \nof bad faith or improper behavior on the part of the agency. \nSTATEMENT \nBoth this Court and the Supreme Court have previously considered the serious \nrecord and discovery-related issues raised in this case. After the district court ordered \nthe government to expand the administrative record, produce a privilege log, and \ndisclose privileged documents, see Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. \n(N.D. Cal.), Dkt. No. 79, the government sought mandamus relief in this Court. After \nthis Court denied the government’s mandamus petition, In re United States, 875 F.3d \n1200 (9th Cir. 2017), the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated this Court’s \nopinion, noting that the government had made “serious arguments” that at least \nportions of the district court’s order were overly broad. In re United States, 138 S. Ct. \n443, 445 (2017). The Supreme Court directed the district court to consider the \ngovernment’s threshold arguments before requiring further discovery or record \nexpansion, and suggested that the district court “consider certifying that ruling for \ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) if appropriate.” Id. The Supreme Court \nfurther instructed that “[t]hereafter, the Court of Appeals or the District Court in the \nfirst instance may consider whether narrower amendments to the record are necessary \nand appropriate.” Id. \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 4 of 25\n \nThe district court stayed its discovery and record expansion orders “pending \nfurther order.” Dkt No. 225. In orders issued on January 9 and 12, 2018, the court \ndenied in substantial part the government’s motion to dismiss and granted plaintiffs’ \npreliminary injunction motion. Dkt Nos. 234, 239. The district court certified its \nrulings on the motion to dismiss for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(b). Dkt No. 234, at 48-49; Dkt No. 239, at 13-14. This Court granted the \ngovernment’s petition for interlocutory appeal, and sua sponte consolidated the \ninterlocutory appeal with the government’s appeals from the district court’s \npreliminary injunction ruling. See Order, No. 18-80004 (9th Cir. Jan. 25, 2018) \n(granting petition for interlocutory appeal); Order, No. 18-15068 (9th Cir. Jan. 17, \n2018) (consolidating appeals). The government filed its opening brief on February 13, \n2018. Plaintiffs filed their opening briefs on March 13, 2018. On March 15, 2018, the \nCourt granted in part the government’s motion to expedite briefing and argument, \nsuch that briefing will be completed by April 17, 2018, and argument will take place in \nMay. \nOn March 8, 2018, the district court issued a new order requiring expansion of \nthe administrative record. Add.1. The district court narrowed its previous order in \nsome respects—by excluding communications from the White House that “never left \nthe White House complex,” Add.6; by exempting records from persons who provided \nonly verbal input to the Acting Secretary unless they were her first-tier subordinates \nwithin DHS, Add.7; and by permitting the parties to re-argue the court’s prior \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 5 of 25\n \nprivilege and waiver determinations, Add.11. The district court also expanded the \nprior order by requiring production of materials directly or indirectly considered by \nformer DHS Secretary John Kelly in issuing his June 2017 DAPA rescission memo, in \naddition to a Februrary 2017 memo regarding immigration enforcement priorities. \nAdd.5. \nNevertheless, the broad sweep of the district court’s prior order remains largely \nintact. In particular, the court’s order continues to require the government to produce: \n1.  All materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by the \nActing Secretary in connection with the potential or actual decision \nto rescind DACA; \n2.  All DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the \ngovernment) who thereafter provided the Acting Secretary with \nwritten advice or input regarding the actual or potential rescission of \nDACA, with the exception that White House documents that never \nleft the White House complex need not be included; \n3.  All DACA-related materials considered by the Acting Secretary’s \nfirst-tier subordinates within DHS who thereafter provided the \nActing Secretary with verbal input regarding the actual or potential \nrescission of DACA; \n4.  All comments and questions propounded by the Acting Secretary to \nadvisors or subordinates or others regarding the actual or potential \nrescission of DACA and their responses; and \n5.  All materials directly or indirectly considered by former Secretary of \nDHS John Kelly leading to his February and June 2017 decisions not \nto rescind DACA. \nAdd.8. The district court further directed the government to file a privilege log \ndescribing any documents withheld from the administrative record. Add.11. \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 6 of 25\n \nRecognizing that this Court is currently considering threshold legal issues that \ncould obviate the order, the district court postponed the deadline for record \nexpansion until six weeks after any final ruling of this Court, including any potential \nreview of that ruling by the Supreme Court. Id. Acting sua sponte, the district court also \ncertified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Add.12. \nDISCUSSION \n1. In certifying its order for interlocutory appeal sua sponte, the district court \ncorrectly recognized that the order raises “controlling questions of law as to which \nthere are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,” and that interlocutory \nappellate review could “materially advance the litigation.” Add.12; see 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(b). The government agrees that, at present, the district court’s record \nexpansion order satisfies the requirements of § 1292(b). The Supreme Court has \nalready noted that the government raised “serious arguments” with respect to the \nbreadth of the district court’s previous record expansion order, and has suggested that \nthis Court should assess whether and to what extent any record expansion is \n“necessary and appropriate,” albeit only after the government’s threshold arguments \nhave first been adjudicated. In re United States, 138 S. Ct. at 445. And the district \ncourt’s order, were it to take effect, would impose upon the government a substantial \nand unnecessary burden. The requirements for interlocutory appeal are therefore \nsatisfied. See, e.g., Wright & Miller, § 3930 (noting that courts have granted petitions \nunder section 1292(b) “if interlocutory reversal might save time for the district court, \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 7 of 25\n \nand time and expense for the litigants”); see also Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska), 643 \nF.3d 681, 688 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting that neither “§ 1292(b)’s literal text nor \ncontrolling precedent requires that the interlocutory appeal have a final, dispositive \neffect on the litigation”). \n2. Although the elements required for interlocutory appeal are present, the \ngovernment respectfully requests that the Court hold this petition in abeyance \npending resolution—including any Supreme Court review—of the appeals currently \nbefore the Court. The district court’s orders will not require any production until after \nthis Court (and, if applicable, the Supreme Court) have decided the currently pending \nappeals. The government’s contention in those consolidated appeals is that plaintiffs’ \nclaims are non-justiciable and that, even assuming such claims are reviewable, \nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the \nActing Secretary’s decision was lawful. If this Court (or the Supreme Court) agrees, \nthen dismissal of some or all of the claims would ensue, which could end the case \nentirely or significantly narrow the scope of claims asserted. As the Supreme Court \nnoted, a decision in the government’s favor on the threshold issues “likely would \neliminate the need for the District Court to examine” an expanded administrative \nrecord. In re United States, 138 S. Ct. at 445. Judicial economy therefore favors holding \nthis petition in abeyance at this time. \n \n \n\n  Case: 18-80037, 03/19/2018, ID: 10803188, DktEntry: 1-2, Page 8 of 25\n \n3. Counsel for plaintiffs informed counsel for the government that they would \ntake no position on the government’s petition or motion to hold the petition in \nabeyance prior to the government’s filing. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should hold in abeyance this petition for \npermission to appeal the order certified by the district court on March 8, 2018, \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).   \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  CHAD A.

No. 234).  In brief, these five lawsuits challenge the Acting Secretary of the Department of\n27\nHomeland Security’s decision in September 2017 to terminate a deferred action policy known\n28\nas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  \nA1\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 24  ooff  1235\n1 Pursuant to their own stipulation, defendants filed an administrative record on October\n2 6, 2017, consisting of fourteen documents received by the Acting Secretary.  These documents\n3 spanned 256 pages, all of which were already public.  All other DACA materials actually\n4 received by the Acting Secretary were withheld based on “deliberative process” and other\n5 privileges.  Plaintiffs immediately moved to require completion of the administrative record,\n6 seeking all materials considered “directly or indirectly” by the Acting Secretary in reaching her\n7 decision to rescind DACA.  Plaintiffs’ motion was granted in part and denied in part on October\n8 17 (Dkt. Nos. 64, 65, 79).1 \n9 The October 17 order directed defendants to complete the administrative record by\n10 adding to it all emails, letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions and other materials\nt 11 directly or indirectly considered in the final agency decision to rescind DACA, to the following\nr\nu\no a 12 extent:\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 1. All materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by the Acting\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Secretary in connection with the potential or actual decision to rescind DACA;\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 2. All DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the\nS N 16 government) who thereafter provided the Acting Secretary with written advice or\nted  For the  17 input regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA;\ni\nn\nU\n18 3. All DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the\n19 government) who thereafter provided the Acting Secretary with verbal input\n20 regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA;\n21 4. All comments and questions propounded by the Acting Secretary to advisors or\n22 subordinates or others regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA and\n23 their responses; and\n24 5. All materials directly or indirectly considered by former Secretary of DHS John\n25 Kelly leading to his February 2017 memorandum not to rescind DACA.\n26 The October 17 order also addressed various privileges — overruling defendants’ claim\n27 of deliberative process privilege as to 35 documents and finding that defendants had waived the\n28\n1    All docket numbers herein refer to the docket in Case No. 17-cv-05211-WHA.\n2\nA2\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 35  ooff  1235\n1 attorney-client privilege as to any materials bearing on whether or not DACA was an unlawful\n2 exercise of DHS authority. \n3 Rather than submit a complete administrative record, defendants filed a petition for writ\n4 of mandamus with our court of appeals.  Our court of appeals denied defendants’ petition (over\n5 one dissent).  Defendants were again ordered to complete the administrative record (Dkt. Nos.\n6 86, 188, 197, 199). \n7 On December 1, defendants filed in the United States Supreme Court a petition for writ\n8 of mandamus and application for a stay, or, in the alternative, for writ of certiorari to our court\n9 of appeals.  The Supreme Court did not reach the merits of defendants’ petition but required that\n10 their jurisdictional defenses be adjudicated prior to consideration of completing the\nt 11 administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 214, 224).\nr\nu\no a 12 An order dated January 9, 2018, ruled on defendants’ threshold jurisdictional arguments\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 and sustained jurisdiction, issues now before our court of appeals.  The parties later submitted\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 argument, at the Court’s invitation, as to whether some narrowing of the October 17 order was\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 necessary or appropriate (Dkt. Nos. 234, 242, 243).  This order follows.  \nS N 16 ANALYSIS\nted  For the  17 1. SCOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD.\ni\nn\nU\n18 The main question addressed in this order is the meaning of the term “the whole record”\n19 in the context of informal agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 706.  This issue is important — not just to\n20 the instant dispute but to all informal agency decisions reviewable under the APA.  Unlike\n21 formal agency adjudication and notice-and-comment rulemaking, informal agency action has no\n22 readily-defined record.  In a rulemaking case, for example, the record is “comprised of\n23 comments received, hearings held, if any, and the basis and purpose statement,” among other\n24 things.  Rodway v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 514 F.2d 809, 817 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  And, the trial-type\n25 record in administrative adjudications consists of “[t]he transcript of testimony and exhibits,\n26 together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding.”  5 U.S.C. § 556. \n27 The Supreme Court has never defined “the whole record” in the context of informal\n28 agency action, our instant setting.  But our court of appeals has explained that the whole record\n3\nA3\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 46  ooff  1235\n1 “is not necessarily those documents that the agency has compiled and submitted as ‘the’\n2 administrative record.”  Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989). \n3 Rather, it “consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by agency\n4 decision-makers and includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Ibid.  The “whole\n5 record” accordingly includes documents that “literally pass[ed] before the eyes of the final\n6 agency decision maker” as well as those considered and relied upon by subordinates who\n7 provided recommendations to the decisionmaker.  California ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep’t of\n8 Agriculture, Nos. 05-cv-3508 & 05-cv-4038, 2006 WL 708914, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006)\n9 (Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Amfac\n10 Resorts, L.L.C. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (Judge Royce\nt 11 Lamberth).  \nr\nu\no a 12 Although the administrative record submitted by defendants is entitled to a presumption\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 of completeness, Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 740 (10th Cir. 1993), this order\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 again finds that plaintiffs have shown, by clear evidence, that the administrative record filed by\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 defendants lacks documents that were considered, directly or indirectly, by the Acting Secretary\nS N 16 in deciding to rescind DACA.  Again, the submitted record consists only of fourteen documents\nted  For the  17 comprising a mere 256 pages — all already public — nearly 200 pages of which consist of the\ni\nn\nU\n18 Supreme Court, Fifth Circuit, and district court opinions in the DAPA litigation.  Our own\n19 Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit have both agreed that it strains credulity that defendants\n20 terminated DACA based solely on fourteen publicly available documents.  See In re United\n21 States, 875 F.3d 1200, 1206 (9th Cir. 2017), judgment vacated on other grounds by In re United\n22 States, 138 S. Ct. 443 (2017);  In Re: Kirstjen M. Nielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d. Cir. Dec. 27, 2017).\n23 But while completion of the administrative record is necessary, this order is mindful of\n24 the Supreme Court’s concern that defendants have raised “serious arguments that at least\n25 portions of the [October 17] order are overly broad.”  In re United States, 138 S. Ct. at 445. \n26 After consideration of the parties’ supplemental submissions on this point, this order will\n27 narrow the October 17 order.\n28\n4\nA4\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 57  ooff  1235\n1 First, even defendants agree that non-privileged materials considered by the Acting\n2 Secretary in connection with the decision to rescind DACA should be included in the record. \n3 Defendants’ supplemental submission does not specifically address, however, whether the\n4 administrative record should include comments and questions propounded by the Acting\n5 Secretary to others (and their responses) regarding the rescission.  This order restates that the\n6 first and fourth categories of materials outlined in the October 17 order should be included in\n7 the administrative record.    \n8 Second, because reasoned agency decision-making “ordinarily demand[s] that [the\n9 agency] display awareness that it is changing position” and “show that there are good reasons\n10 for the new policy,” F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009), the\nt 11 October 17 order directed defendants to include in the administrative record all materials\nr\nu\no a 12 directly or indirectly considered by Secretary Kelly that led to his earlier decision to continue\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the DACA program.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Two events are relevant.  In February 2017, Secretary Kelly issued guidance regarding\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement priorities which — despite rescinding\nS N 16 “all existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of\nted  For the  17 our immigration laws and priorities for removal” — explicitly left DACA in place.  Then, in\ni\nn\nU\n18 June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded the 2014 DAPA memo while again declaring that DACA\n19 would remain in effect.  Materials considered by Secretary Kelly that led to his February and\n20 June 2017 decisions to continue DACA are pertinent here, and the inclusion of such documents\n21 in the administrative record remains required.2\n22 Third, the Acting Secretary surely received both written and verbal input from her\n23 subordinates regarding the decision to rescind DACA.  Yet the record lacks even a single\n24 communication from any of the Acting Secretary’s subordinates.  With respect to written input,\n25 the October 17 order sought to remedy this omission in two ways.  One was to require inclusion\n26\n2  While the October 17 order only required defendants to include materials directly or indirectly\n27\nconsidered by Secretary Kelly leading to his February 2017 decision, upon further reflection, defendants should\nalso be required to include materials directly or indirectly considered by Secretary Kelly leading to his June\n28\n2017 decision. \n  \n5\nA5\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 68  ooff  1235\n1 of some materials sent to the Acting Secretary that were previously withheld under a claim of\n2 deliberate process privilege.  The other was to require inclusion of all DACA-related materials\n3 considered by persons (anywhere in the government) who, after such consideration, provided\n4 the Acting Secretary with written input regarding the rescission of DACA.  In other words,\n5 anyone providing written input to the Acting Secretary on the rescission was required to\n6 produce their DACA materials (up to the date of their input) on the premise that such materials\n7 had informed their input.3 \n8 Defendants argue that this category of materials should be narrowed so as to exclude\n9 any document originating from the White House, whether or not such documents are in the\n10 possession of DHS or another agency.  For their part, plaintiffs suggest exempting from the\nt 11 administrative record any White House documents that never left the White House complex. \nr\nu\no a 12 This order accepts plaintiffs’ narrower version.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Communications from the White House residing at DHS remain an important part of the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 administrative record (in part due to the White House’s emphasis of the President’s direct role\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 in decisions concerning the program).  Indeed, defendants concede that the Acting Secretary\nS N 16 received advice from other members of the Executive Branch in making her decision and\nted  For the  17 referred to “White House memorandum” in their privilege log (Dkt. No. 71-2).  But to curtail\ni\nn\nU\n18 any separation-of-powers concerns, defendants need not collect materials from White House\n19 personnel.  The agency defendants need look no further than their own files.  In all other\n20 respects, however, the second category of materials described in the October 17 order remains\n21 intact.\n22 Fourth, with respect to verbal input to the Acting Secretary, to capture the factual\n23 information verbally conveyed and considered in connection with the decision to rescind\n24 DACA, the October 17 order similarly required inclusion of all DACA-related materials\n25 considered by persons (anywhere in the government) who thereafter provided the Acting\n26 Secretary with verbal input regarding the rescission.  Defendants argue that the collection and\n27\n3  Although the October 17 order overruled defendants’ privilege assertions with respect to some of the\n28\nwritten inputs received by the Acting Secretary from her subordinates, these materials have not yet been\nincluded in the administrative record.   \n6\nA6\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 1 79  ooff  1235\n1 review of documents from custodians who provided only verbal advice is overly burdensome\n2 and disproportionate to the needs of the case.  Plaintiffs, in turn, suggest that this requirement\n3 be narrowed to apply only to materials located within or reviewed by DHS or DOJ personnel\n4 rather than anywhere in the government.\n5 The appellate caselaw has never expressly considered how, if at all, verbal input to an\n6 agency decisionmaker should be reflected in the administrative record.  Verbal input, of course,\n7 can be every bit as influential — perhaps more influential — in shaping informal agency\n8 decisions as written input.  Yet despite government counsel’s acknowledgment that verbal input\n9 likely occurred (Dkt. No. 78 at 31:5), the thin administrative record supplied thus far omits even\n10 a clue as to the verbal advice received by the Acting Secretary on the question of the rescission\nt 11 of DACA.   \nr\nu\no a 12 Nevertheless, this order narrows the October 17 order in that defendants need only add\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 to the administrative record documents of the Acting Secretary’s first-tier subordinates who\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 provided verbal input regarding the rescission of DACA.  Figuring out who gave verbal input\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 will not be as hard as the government suggests.  One method would be to ask the decisionmaker\nS N 16 which first-tier subordinates provided verbal input and then include in the administrative record\nted  For the  17 the relevant files and emails of such subordinates up to the date of their last input.  Another\ni\nn\nU\n18 would be to ask the first-tier subordinates if they gave verbal input and, if so, to include their\n19 DACA files and emails up to the date of their last input.  Yet another method would be to\n20 review the emails of the Acting Secretary and first-tier subordinates for references to verbal\n21 input, such as references to a meeting on the subject or to follow up on a verbal\n22 recommendation.  This order leaves it to government counsel to select the combination of\n23 methods best calculated to retrieve the relevant records.  The government is not required to\n24 construct records that never existed but only to corral the records that plausibly informed the\n25 verbal input received by the Acting Secretary.4\n26\n27\n4  The narrower administrative record set forth in this order more closely aligns with that required by\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis in the parallel DACA actions pending in the United States District Court for the\n28\nEastern District of New York.  See Batalla Vidal v. Duke, No. 16-cv-4756, 2017 WL 4737280, at *5 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. 19, 2017).\n7\nA7\n\n C Caassee 3: :1187--8c0v0-03572, 1013-/W19H/2A0  1 D8,o IcDu:m 1e0n8t0 236168 8  ,F DilektdE 0n3tr/y0:8 1/1-28,   P Paaggee 2 80  ooff  1235\n1 In sum, defendants are directed to complete the administrative record by adding to it all\n2 emails, letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions and other materials directly or\n3 indirectly considered in the final agency decision to rescind DACA, to the following extent:\n4  1. All materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by the Acting\n5 Secretary in connection with the potential or actual decision to rescind DACA;\n6  2.

PRIVILEGE.\n2 A. Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege. \n3 The October 17 order held that defendants waived attorney-client privilege over any\n4 materials that bore on whether or not DACA was an unlawful exercise of executive power and\n5 therefore should be rescinded.  This holding was based on the well-established principle that\n6 parties are not permitted to advance conclusions that favor their position in litigation and at the\n7 same time shield the information that led to those conclusions from discovery.  See Chevron\n8 Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 1992).  Put differently, “[t]he privilege\n9 which protects attorney-client communications may not be used both as a sword and a shield.” \n10 Ibid.  Where a party raises a claim, which in fairness to its adversary requires it to reveal the\nt 11 information or communication that claim is predicated upon, it has implicitly waived any\nr\nu\no a 12 privilege over that communication. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Here, DHS’s rationale for rescinding DACA was its purported illegality (see Dkt. No.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 64-1 at 253–56 (Rescission Memorandum)).  And although defendants included the September\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 4 legal opinion of the Attorney General in the administrative record, they sought to conceal all\nS N 16 other legal analysis available to the Acting Secretary or the Attorney General.  The October 17\nted  For the  17 order thus determined that defendants could not simultaneously refuse to disclose the legal\ni\nn\nU\n18 research that led to that conclusion. \n19 As explained in a later order dated January 9, however, the INA itself makes clear that\n20 once the Attorney General determined that DACA was illegal, the Acting Secretary had to\n21 accept his ruling as “controlling.”  Section 1103(a)(1) of Title 8, a provision that allocates\n22 immigration power and duties among the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of\n23 State, and the Attorney General, provides that “determination and ruling by the Attorney\n24 General with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.”  Therefore, once the Attorney\n25 General advised the Acting Secretary that DACA was illegal, that determination became\n26 controlling and any legal analysis provided by others would be irrelevant.  Put differently, the\n27 Acting Secretary did not “rely” on the advice of counsel and thus waive the privilege (as to all\n28\n9\nA9\n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1178--c8v0-003572,1 013-W/1H9/A2 0  1D8o, cIDum: 1e0n8t 0236168  8 F, iDlekdtE 0n3t/r0y8: /11-82 ,   PPaaggee  2120  ooff  2153\n1 other legal advice available to her).  Instead, she became bound by the “controlling” Attorney\n2 General determination.\n3 On the other hand, the government has maintained that the basis of the rescission was\n4 not the legal determination that DACA was illegal but rather was a judgment call based on\n5 balancing litigation risk.  Viewed in that light, the original waiver analysis would seem to\n6 remain valid, such that all legal advice on DACA’s legality made available to the Acting\n7 Secretary and/or the Attorney General would be includable in the administrative record.  \n8 In light of this more nuanced analysis, this order finds it prudent to wait and decide the\n9 scope of defendants’ waiver of attorney-client privilege until Section 1103(a)(1)’s import is\n10 considered by our court of appeals in connection with the currently pending interlocutory\nt 11 appeal of the January 9 order.  For the time being, no waiver of the attorney-client privilege will\nr\nu\no a 12 be enforced (although any materials withheld on this ground must be logged).5\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 B. Privilege Assertions. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 While defendants did not file a privilege log with their original production, they later,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 pursuant to order, filed a privilege log claiming attorney-client, deliberative process, and other\nS N 16 privileges over 84 documents considered by the Acting Secretary (Dkt. Nos. 67, 71-2).  The\nted  For the  17 October 17 order overruled the privilege assertions as to 35 of the withheld documents\ni\nn\nU\n18 (although so far none have been produced).  The October 17 order further required that\n19 defendants maintain a privilege log for all future documents withheld on grounds of privilege. \n20 In their supplemental submission, defendants repeat their objection to providing a privilege log. \n21 To reiterate, our court of appeals has not spoken on this issue.  Every court in this\n22 district to consider the issue, however, has required administrative agencies to provide a\n23 privilege log in withholding documents that otherwise belong in the administrative record.  See,\n24 e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15-cv-01590, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May\n25 3, 2017) (Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No.\n26 16-cv-01574, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017) (Judge Vince Chhabria);\n27\n28\n5  Notably, the parties did not raise or address the impact of Section 1103(a)(1) in any of their briefing. \nAccordingly, it was not considered in connection with the October 17 order.\n10\nA10\n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1178--c8v0-003572,1 013-W/1H9/A2 0  1D8o, cIDum: 1e0n8t 0236168  8 F, iDlekdtE 0n3t/r0y8: /11-82 ,   PPaaggee  2131  ooff  2153\n1 Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *4.  As a practical matter, if agencies were permitted to withhold\n2 materials from the administrative record on the basis of privilege, but were not required to\n3 submit a privilege log, their withholding based on privilege would never surface and would\n4 wholly evade review.  This would invite all manner of mischief.  Accordingly, this order holds\n5 once again that a privilege log is required.  The privilege log shall comply with the\n6 supplemental order setting the initial case management conference in this case, and shall\n7 include all authors and recipients of privileged documents, as well as the other information set\n8 forth in that order (see Dkt. No. 23 ¶ 18).  \n9 With respect to documents previously identified on defendants’ earlier privilege log, the\n10 Court has already ruled on each document following an in camera review.  If, however,\nt 11 defendants wish to relitigate those rulings via a more thorough review than before (despite\nr\nu\no a 12 defendants’ earlier request only for an in camera review), then the following procedures will\nC ni\n  or\nict Calif 13 apply.  Within TWENTY-EIGHT CALENDAR DAYS of the finality of any appellate order\ntr of \nDis strict  14 sustaining reviewability of the rescission of DACA (as defined above), defendants may file a\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 brief (on the public docket) presenting argument as to why the subject documents should remain\nS N 16 withheld as privileged.  Also at that time, defendants shall submit under seal declarations\nted  For the  17 invoking and justifying the relevant privilege.  These filings shall also be provided to plaintiffs,\ni\nn\nU\n18 but may be redacted to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to maintain the privilege\n19 asserted.  Within FOURTEEN CALENDAR DAYS of defendants’ submission, plaintiffs may file a\n20 response.  The Court will then review the materials and allow argument by defendants’ counsel\n21 at an ex parte hearing.  Plaintiffs’ counsel shall standby outside the courtroom.  Without\n22 revealing specifics of the withheld materials, the Court may invite plaintiffs’ counsel to make\n23 one or more cameo appearances to argue as appropriate.  The foregoing deadlines pertain only\n24 to the 35 documents previously ordered to be added to the administrative record (should the\n25 government want to relitigate that ruling).  Should plaintiffs wish to relitigate the privilege issue\n26 as to the documents for which the privilege was previously sustained, the same procedures shall\n27 apply.\n28\n11\nA11\n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1178--c8v0-003572,1 013-W/1H9/A2 0  1D8o, cIDum: 1e0n8t 0236168  8 F, iDlekdtE 0n3t/r0y8: /11-82 ,   PPaaggee  2142  ooff  2153\n1 With respect to the larger administrative record yet to be provided, if defendants redact\n2 or withhold any material based on deliberative process or any other privilege, they shall\n3 simultaneously lodge for the Court’s review full copies of all such materials, indicating by\n4 highlighting (or otherwise) the redactions and withholdings together with a privilege log for\n5 each.  The parties shall follow the same procedures outlined above, and within TWENTY-EIGHT\n6 CALENDAR DAYS from the date on which the privilege log and withheld documents are\n7 submitted, defendants shall submit their brief and supporting declarations.  Within FOURTEEN\n8 CALENDAR DAYS of defendants’ submission, plaintiffs may file a response.  The Court will\n9 again allow ex parte argument by defendants’ counsel if requested and may invite argument\n10 from plaintiffs’ counsel to the extent appropriate.\nt 11 All privilege issues are hereby REFERRED to MAGISTRATE JUDGE SALLIE KIM to be\nr\nu\no a 12 heard and determined in accordance with the above procedures.    \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 CONCLUSION\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Defendants shall file an amended administrative record in conformity with this order\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 within FORTY-TWO CALENDAR DAYS of any final appellate ruling that the agency action\nS N 16 terminating DACA is reviewable.

In 2014, Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum that announced \nthe related Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful  Permanent  Residents  program  (DAPA),  which \nallowed deferred action for certain noncitizen parents of \nAmerican  citizens  and  lawful  permanent  residents,  and \nexpanded DACA.

OF CAL. V. USDHS  9 \n \nJohnson memorandum were enjoined nationwide in a district \ncourt order upheld by the Fifth Circuit and affirmed by an \nequally divided Supreme Court.  After a new presidential \nadministration took office, Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Elaine Duke issued a memorandum in September \n2017 rescinding DACA.   \nSuits were filed in the Northern District of California by \nthe Regents of the University of California, a group of states \nled by California, the City of San Jose, the County of Santa \nClara and Service Employees International Union Local 521, \nand a group of individual DACA recipients led by Dulce \nGarcia.  The cases were consolidated, and the district court \nordered  the  government  to  complete  the  administrative \nrecord.  Seeking to avoid providing additional documents, \nthe government filed a petition for mandamus, which this \ncourt denied.  The government petitioned the Supreme Court \nfor the same mandamus relief; the Court did not reach the \nmerits of the administrative record dispute, but instructed the \ndistrict  court  to  rule  on  the  government’s  threshold \narguments  challenging  reviewability  of  its  rescission \ndecision.  The district court entered a preliminary injunction \nrequiring  DHS  to  adjudicate  renewal  applications  for \nexisting DACA recipients, and the court partially granted \nand partially denied the government’s motion to dismiss. \nThe panel held that neither the Administrative Procedure \nAct nor the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) barred \njudicial review of the decision to rescind DACA.  With \nrespect to the APA, the panel reviewed the cases of Heckler \nv. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), Montana Air Chapter No. \n29 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 898 F.2d 753 (9th \nCir. 1990), and City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290 \n(2013).    The  panel  concluded  that,  where  the  agency’s \ndecision is based not on an exercise of discretion, but instead \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e1 01 0o fo 9f 999\n10  REGENTS OF THE UNIV. OF CAL. V. USDHS \n \non a belief that any alternative choice was foreclosed by law \nbecause the agency lacked authority, the APA’s “committed \nto  agency  discretion”  bar  to  reviewability,  5  U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2), does not apply.  The panel also concluded that \nthe Acting Secretary based the rescission of DACA solely \non a belief that DACA was beyond the authority of DHS.  \nAccordingly, the panel determined that the rescission was \nwithin the realm of agency actions reviewable under the \nAPA. \nWith  respect  to  the  INA,  the  panel  rejected  the \ngovernment’s contention that review was barred by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g), which precludes judicial review of “any cause or \nclaim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision \nor  action  of  the  [Secretary  of  Homeland  Security]  to \ncommence  proceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute \nremoval orders.”  The panel explained that, under Reno v. \nAm.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471 (1999), \nthe rescission does not fall within the three discrete actions \nmentioned in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \nHaving concluded that neither the APA nor the INA \nprecludes judicial review, the panel turned to the merits of \nthe  preliminary  injunction  and  considered  whether  the \nagency was correct in concluding that DACA was unlawful.  \nThe Attorney General’s primary bases for concluding that \nDACA was illegal were that the program was “effectuated . \n. . without proper statutory authority” and that it amounted \nto  “an  unconstitutional  exercise  of  authority.”    More \nspecifically, the Attorney General asserted that “the DACA \npolicy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the \ncourts recognized as to DAPA” in the Fifth Circuit litigation.  \nThe  panel  considered  the  DAPA  litigation,  comparing \naspects  of  DAPA  and  DACA,  and  concluded  that  that \nDACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion, \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e1 11 1o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV. OF CAL. V. USDHS  11 \n \nnotwithstanding  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  conclusion  that  the \nrelated DAPA program exceeded DHS’s statutory authority.  \nThus, the panel concluded that, because the Acting Secretary \nwas incorrect in her belief that DACA was illegal and had to \nbe  rescinded,  plaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  in \ndemonstrating that the rescission must be set aside under the \nAPA as arbitrary and capricious.  \nThe panel next concluded that the district court did not \nabuse  its  discretion  in  issuing  a  nationwide  injunction, \nnoting  that  such  relief  is  commonplace  in  APA  cases, \npromotes uniformity in immigration enforcement, and is \nnecessary  to  provide  the  plaintiffs  here  with  complete \nredress. \nFinally, addressing the district court’s order granting in \npart and denying in part the government’s motion to dismiss, \nthe court concluded that the district court properly dismissed \nplaintiffs’ APA notice-and-comment claim, and their claim \nthat  the  DACA  rescission  violates  their  substantive  due \nprocess rights.  The panel further concluded that the district \ncourt  also  properly  denied  the  government’s  motion  to \ndismiss plaintiffs’ APA arbitrary-and-capricious claim, their \nclaim that the new information-sharing policy violates their \ndue process rights, and their claim that the DACA rescission \nviolates their right to equal protection. \nConcurring in the judgment, Judge Owens wrote that, as \nhe believed the Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim has some \nlikelihood of success on the merits, he concurred in the \njudgment affirming the preliminary injunction.  However, \nJudge Owens disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that \notherwise unreviewable agency action is reviewable when \nthe  agency  justifies  its  action  by  reference  to  its \nunderstanding of its jurisdiction.  Therefore, Judge Owens \nwould  hold  that  § 701(a)(2)  precludes  the  court  from \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e1 21 2o fo 9f 999\n12  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Judge Owens would also affirm the preliminary \ninjunction and remand for consideration whether Plaintiffs \nhave demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of \ntheir Equal Protection claim. \nAs for the government’s appeal from the motions to \ndismiss, Judge Owens dissented from the majority’s holding \nto affirm the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ APA arbitrary-and-capricious claim.  However, \nhe concurred in the majority’s holding to affirm the district \ncourt’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ APA notice-and-comment \nclaim.  He also concurred in the judgment to affirm the \ndistrict court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ Due Process claims.  He \nalso agreed with the majority’s decision to affirm the district \ncourt’s denial of the motion to dismiss the Equal Protection \nclaim and hold that the Equal Protection claim offers an \nalternative ground to affirm the preliminary injunction. \n \n \nCOUNSEL \n \nHashim M.

Born into poverty, Garcia and her parents \nshared a San Diego house with other families to save money \non rent; she was even homeless for a time as a child.  But she \nstudied  hard  and  excelled  academically  in  high  school.  \nWhen her family could not afford to send her to the top \nuniversity where she had been accepted, Garcia enrolled in \na local community college and ultimately put herself through \na  four-year  university,  where  she  again  excelled  while \nworking full-time as a legal assistant.  She then was awarded \na scholarship that, together with her mother’s life savings, \nenabled her to fulfill her longstanding dream of attending \nand graduating from law school.  Today, Garcia maintains a \nthriving legal practice in San Diego, where she represents \nmembers of underserved communities in civil, criminal, and \nimmigration proceedings. \nOn the surface, Dulce Garcia appears no different from \nany other productive—indeed, inspiring—young American.  \nBut one thing sets her apart.  Garcia’s parents brought her to \nthis country in violation of United States immigration laws \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e2 12 1o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Though the United States of \nAmerica is the only home she has ever known, Dulce Garcia \nis an undocumented immigrant. \nRecognizing the cruelty and wastefulness of deporting \nproductive young people to countries with which they have \nno ties, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a \npolicy in 2012 that would provide some relief to individuals \nlike Garcia, while allowing our communities to continue to \nbenefit from their contributions.  Known as Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the program allows those \nnoncitizens who unwittingly entered the United States as \nchildren, who have clean criminal records, and who meet \nvarious educational or military service requirements to apply \nfor  two-year  renewable  periods  of  deferred  action—a \nrevocable  decision  by  the  government  not  to  deport  an \notherwise removable person from the country.  DACA also \nallows recipients to apply for authorization to work in this \ncountry legally, paying taxes and operating in the above-\nground economy.  Garcia, along with hundreds of thousands \nof other young people, trusting the government to honor its \npromises, leapt at the opportunity. \nBut after a change in presidential administrations, in \n2017 the government moved to end the DACA program.  \nWhy?  According to the Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, upon the legal advice of the Attorney General, \nDACA was illegal from its inception, and therefore could no \nlonger continue in effect.  And after Dulce Garcia—along \nwith  other  DACA  recipients  and  affected  states, \nmunicipalities,  and  organizations—challenged  this \nconclusion in the federal courts, the government adopted the \nposition  that  its  fundamentally  legal  determination  that \nDACA is unlawful is unreviewable by the judicial branch. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e2 22 2o fo 9f 999\n22  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803).  \nThe government’s decision to rescind DACA is subject to \njudicial  review.    And,  upon  review,  we  conclude  that \nplaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  on  their  claim  that  the \nrescission of DACA—at least as justified on this record—is \narbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.    We  therefore  affirm  the  district  court’s  grant  of \npreliminary injunctive relief.1 \nI. \nA.  History of Deferred Action \nThe central benefit available under the DACA program \nis deferred action.  Because much of this dispute revolves \naround  the  legitimacy  of  that  practice,  we  begin  by \nreviewing the Executive Branch’s historical use of deferred \naction. \nThe basic concept is a simple one: deferred action is a \ndecision  by  Executive  Branch  officials  not  to  pursue \ndeportation proceedings against an individual or class of \nindividuals otherwise eligible for removal from this country.  \nSee 6 Charles Gordon et al., Immigration Law & Procedure \n§ 72.03[2][h] (2018) (“To ameliorate a harsh and unjust \noutcome, the immigration agency may decline to institute \nproceedings, may terminate proceedings, or may decline to \n                                                                                                 \n1 We also affirm in part the district court’s partial grant and partial \ndenial of the government’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e2 32 3o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Reno, 236 F.3d \n1115, 1119 n.3 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Deferred action refers to an \nexercise of administrative discretion by the [immigration \nagency] under which [it] takes no action to proceed against \nan apparently deportable alien based on a prescribed set of \nfactors generally related to humanitarian grounds.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)); Hiroshi Motomura, Immigration \nOutside the Law 29 (2014) (noting that “deferred action is \nusually granted only for limited periods of time and does not \nprovide  a  path  to  lawful  permanent  resident  status  or \ncitizenship”). \nUnlike  most  other  forms  of  relief  from  deportation, \ndeferred action is not expressly grounded in statute.  It arises \ninstead from the Executive’s inherent authority to allocate \nresources  and  prioritize  cases.    Cf.  6  U.S.C.  § 202(5) \n(charging  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  with \n“[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies \nand  priorities”).

But  despite  its  non-statutory  origins,  Congress  has \nhistorically recognized the existence of deferred action in \namendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), \nas  well  as  other  statutory  enactments.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1227(d)(2) (“The denial of a request for an administrative \nstay of removal under this subsection shall not preclude the \nalien from applying for . . . deferred action[.]”); REAL ID \nAct of 2005, Pub.

After the Lennon case revealed the practice, the INS \nissued its first public guidance on the use of deferred action, \nstating  that  “[i]n  every  case  where  the  district  director \ndetermines that adverse action would be unconscionable \nbecause of the existence of appealing humanitarian factors, \nhe  shall  recommend  consideration  for  nonpriority.”  \nImmigration  and  Naturalization  Service,  Operations \nInstructions  § 103.1(a)(1)(ii)  (1975)  (quoted  in  Wadhia, \nsupra, at 17).  Although the 1975 guidance was rescinded in \n1997,  DHS  officials  continue  to  apply  the  same \nhumanitarian  factors  in  deciding  whether  to  grant  an \nindividual  deferred  action.    6  Gordon  et  al.,  supra, \n§ 72.03[2][h] & nn.133–34; see also AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 \nn.8. \nIn addition to case-by-case adjudications, the Executive \nBranch has frequently applied deferred action and related \nforms  of  discretionary  relief  programmatically,  to  entire \nclasses of otherwise removable noncitizens.

See  White  House  Statement  on  the \nTermination  of  the  Emergency  Program  for  Hungarian \nRefugees (Dec. 28, 1957).  The power to parole—that is, to \nallow a noncitizen physically to enter the country, while \ntreating  that  person  as  “at  the  border”  for  purposes  of \nimmigration law—is established by statute, but the version \nof the INA in existence when President Eisenhower acted \ndid not explicitly authorize programmatic exercises of the \nparole power.2  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \nPub.

The  Immigration \nReform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) had provided a \npathway  to  legal  status  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of \nundocumented noncitizens, but did not make any provision \nfor their close relatives unless those individuals separately \nqualified under the Act’s criteria.

The DACA Program \nDACA was announced in a June 15, 2012, memorandum \nfrom Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano,4 \nentitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect \nto Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children.”  \nSecretary  Napolitano  explained  that  the  nation’s \nimmigration  laws  “are  not  designed  . . .  to  remove \nproductive young people to countries where they may not \nhave lived or even speak the language,” especially where \n“many of these young people have already contributed to our \ncountry in significant ways,” and, because they were brought \nhere as children, “lacked the intent to violate the law.”  She \ntherefore determined that “[p]rosecutorial discretion, which \nis used in so many other areas, is especially justified here.” \nThe Napolitano memorandum thus laid out the basic \ncriteria of the DACA program, under which a noncitizen will \nbe considered for a grant of deferred action if he or she: \n•  came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n                                                                                                 \n4 Napolitano is a party to this appeal in her current capacity as \nPresident of the University of California. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e2 92 9o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Twenty-six states challenged this \nextension  in  federal  court,  arguing  that  DAPA  is \nunconstitutional.  All of the policies outlined in the Johnson \nmemorandum were enjoined nationwide in a district court \norder upheld by the Fifth Circuit and affirmed by an equally \ndivided Supreme Court.  See United States v. Texas, 136 S. \nCt. 2271 (2016); Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th \nCir. 2015); Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. \nTex. 2015); see also Neil v.

He wrote: \nDACA  was  effectuated  by  the  previous \nadministration  through  executive  action, \nwithout proper statutory authority and with \nno established end-date, after Congress’[s] \nrepeated rejection of proposed legislation that \nwould have accomplished a similar result.  \nSuch  an  open-ended  circumvention  of \nimmigration  laws  was  an  unconstitutional \nexercise  of  authority  by  the  Executive \nBranch. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e3 33 3o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

The  memorandum  begins  with  a \n“Background” section that covers DACA, DAPA, the Texas \nlitigation,  Secretary  Kelly’s  previous  memoranda,  Texas \nAttorney  General  Paxton’s  threat,  and  the  Attorney \nGeneral’s letter.

As of September 4, 2017—the day before \nthe  rescission—approximately  689,800  individuals  were \nenrolled in DACA. \nC.  Procedural History \nThe  rescission  of  DACA  instantly  sparked  litigation \nacross the country, including the cases on appeal here.  Suits \nwere  filed in the Northern District of California by the \nRegents of the University of California, a group of states led \nby California, the City of San Jose, the County of Santa \nClara and Service Employees International Union Local 521, \nand a group of individual DACA recipients led by Dulce \nGarcia.  The complaints included claims that the rescission \nwas  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act (APA); that it was a substantive rule requiring \nnotice-and-comment  rulemaking  under  the  APA;  that  it \nviolated  the  due  process  and  equal  protection  rights \nprotected  by  the  U.S.  Constitution;  and  that  DHS  was \nequitably estopped from using the information provided on \nDACA applications for enforcement purposes.  The cases \nwere  consolidated  before  Judge  William  Alsup  in  the \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California and \nproceeded to litigation. \nOn  October  17,  2017,  the  district  court  ordered  the \ngovernment to complete the administrative record, holding \nthat the record proffered by the government was incomplete \nin several respects.  Seeking to avoid providing additional \ndocuments, the government filed a petition for mandamus.  \nIn arguing its mandamus petition, the government took the \nposition that the legality of the rescission should stand or fall \nbased solely on the reasons and the record already provided \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e3 53 5o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

We denied the mandamus petition, \nstating that “the notion that the head of a United States \nagency would decide to terminate a program giving legal \nprotections to roughly 800,000 people based solely on 256 \npages of publicly available documents is not credible, as the \ndistrict court concluded.”  In re United States, 875 F.3d \n1200, 1206 (9th Cir. 2017) (footnotes omitted). \nThe government next petitioned the Supreme Court for \nthe same mandamus relief; the Court did not reach the merits \nof the administrative record dispute, but instead instructed \nthe  district  court  to  rule  on  the  government’s  threshold \narguments  challenging  reviewability  of  its  rescission \ndecision  before  requiring  the  government  to  provide \nadditional documents.  In re United States, 138 S. Ct. 443, \n445 (2017).  Thus, the administrative record in this case still \nconsists of a scant 256 publicly available pages, roughly \nthree-quarters of which are taken up by the three published \njudicial opinions from the Texas litigation. \nReturning to the district court, the government moved to \ndismiss the consolidated cases on jurisdictional grounds and \nfor failure to state a claim, while the plaintiffs moved for a \npreliminary injunction.  The district court granted the request \nfor a nationwide preliminary injunction, holding that most of \nthe plaintiffs had standing;7 that neither the APA nor the \nINA barred judicial review; and that plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on their claim that the decision to rescind DACA \nwas arbitrary and capricious.  The district court therefore \nentered a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to adjudicate \nrenewal applications for existing DACA recipients. \n                                                                                                 \n7 Two states were dismissed from the case with leave to amend.  \nThat decision is not challenged on appeal. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e3 63 6o fo 9f 999\n36  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Reviewability under the APA \nThe APA provides for broad judicial review of agency \naction: “A person suffering legal wrong because of agency \naction, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action \nwithin the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial \nreview thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Thus, as a general matter, \nthe Supreme Court has consistently articulated “a ‘strong \npresumption’  favoring  judicial  review  of  administrative \naction.”  Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 \n(2015) (quoting Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, \n476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986)); see also, e.g., Lincoln v.

Gardner,  387  U.S.  136,  140 \n(1967)). \nHowever, the APA also forecloses judicial review under \nits procedures to the extent that “agency action is committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).8  “This \n                                                                                                 \n8 This bar does not affect a plaintiff’s ability to bring freestanding \nconstitutional claims.

It is one thing to read the APA’s exception for \n“agency action [] committed to agency discretion by law” as \nincluding the Executive’s discretionary decisions to decline \nenforcement, given a pre-existing legal tradition that had \ntreated those decisions as unreviewable.  It would be quite \nanother to say that an agency’s non-discretionary belief that \nit  lacked  the  power  to  enforce  the  law  was  similarly \n“committed to agency discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see \nChaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4 (“[W]e note that in those \nsituations  [involving  a  belief  that  the  agency  lacked \ndiscretion,] the statute conferring authority on the agency \nmight indicate that such decisions were not ‘committed to \nagency discretion.’”). \nSeveral years after Chaney, our court directly addressed \nthe question that the Supreme Court had left  open.   In \nMontana Air Chapter No. 29 v. Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority, a union representing civilian Air National Guard \nemployees filed an unfair labor practice charge against the \nNational Guard Bureau, but the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority (FLRA) refused to issue a complaint.  898 F.2d \n753, 755 (9th Cir. 1990).

We took the \nnext logical step, holding that Chaney’s presumption of \nnonreviewability “may be overcome if the refusal is based \nsolely  on  the  erroneous  belief  that  the  agency  lacks \njurisdiction.”  Id. at 754.  Because “the General Counsel’s \ndecision not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint was \nbased on his belief that he lacked jurisdiction to issue such a \ncomplaint,”  we  proceeded  to  “examine  the  General \nCounsel’s  statutory  and  regulatory  interpretations  to \ndetermine  if  his  belief  that  he  lacked  jurisdiction  was \ncorrect.”  Id. at 757.10 \nThe final piece of the APA reviewability puzzle is the \nSupreme  Court’s  decision  in  City  of  Arlington  v.

With respect to courts, the \njurisdictional/nonjurisdictional  divide  is  a  real  and \nconsequential one, because “[a] court’s power to decide a \ncase is independent of whether its decision is correct . . . . \nPut differently, a jurisdictionally proper but substantively \nincorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.”  Id.  But the \nsame is not true with respect to agencies: “Both their power \nto act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by \nCongress, so that when they act improperly, no less than \nwhen they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra \nvires.”  Id.  Thus, the Court concluded, “[t]he reality, laid \nbare, is that there is no difference, insofar as the validity of \nagency action is concerned, between an agency’s exceeding \nthe scope of its authority (its ‘jurisdiction’) and its exceeding \nauthorized application of authority that it unquestionably \nhas.”  Id. at 299 (emphasis in original).11 \nTo summarize, Chaney holds that an agency’s refusal to \nenforce the substantive law is presumptively unreviewable \nbecause  that  discretionary  nonenforcement  function  is \n“committed to agency discretion” within the meaning of the \nAPA.  Montana Air builds upon the question left open by \nChaney’s footnote four, explaining that a nonenforcement \ndecision  is  reviewable  notwithstanding  Chaney  if  the \ndecision was based solely on the agency’s belief that it \nlacked jurisdiction to act.

See, e.g., City of Arlington, \n569 U.S. at 301 (“In sum, judges should not waste their time in the \nmental acrobatics needed to decide whether an agency’s interpretation of \na statutory provision is ‘jurisdictional’ or ‘nonjurisdictional.’  Once those \nlabels are sheared away, it becomes clear that the question in every case \nis, simply, whether the statutory text forecloses the agency’s assertion of \nauthority, or not.”). \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e4 34 3o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

The rule that emerges \nis this: an agency’s nonenforcement decision is outside the \nscope  of  the  Chaney  presumption—and  is  therefore \npresumptively reviewable—if it is based solely on a belief \nthat the agency lacked the lawful authority to do otherwise.  \nThat is, where the agency’s decision is based not on an \nexercise  of  discretion,  but  instead  on  a  belief  that  any \nalternative  choice  was  foreclosed  by  law,  the  APA’s \n“committed  to  agency  discretion”  bar  to  reviewability, \n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), does not apply. \nThis rule is fully consistent with the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in ICC v.

We \nhave no quarrel with that statement in the abstract, but as \napplied it simply begs the question: is the agency action in \nquestion “otherwise unreviewable”? \nThe  BLE  case  concerned  the  reviewability  of  the \nInterstate Commerce Commission’s denial of a motion to \nreopen proceedings on grounds of material error.  Id. at 280.  \nThe Supreme Court held that category of agency action \npresumptively unreviewable because it “perceive[d] . . . a \nsimilar tradition of nonreviewability” to the one it had found \nin Chaney for nonenforcement decisions.  Id. at 282.  In \nreaching its holding, the Court rejected an argument that \nthere was nevertheless “law to apply”—and that therefore \nthe action was not committed to agency discretion—as the \nagency’s order had discussed the legal merits at length.

What mattered was that the agency’s “formal \naction” was one for which a tradition of nonreviewability \nwas discernable, regardless of how the agency explained its \naction.12  Id. \nBLE thus stands for the proposition that if a particular \ntype of agency action is presumptively unreviewable, the \nfact that the agency explains itself in terms that are judicially \ncognizable  does  not  change  the  categorical  rule.    Fair \nenough.  But the categorical rule announced in Chaney does \nnot encompass nonenforcement decisions based solely on \nthe agency’s belief that it lacked power to take a particular \ncourse; instead, the Court explicitly declined to extend its \nrule to that situation.  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4.  And in \nMontana Air, we held that such decisions are reviewable.  \n898  F.2d  at  754.    BLE’s  statement  about  “otherwise \nunreviewable” agency decisions, 482 U.S. at 283, therefore \nhas no application to the category of agency action at issue \nhere. \nWe  believe  the  analysis  laid  out  above  follows \nnecessarily from existing doctrine.  And, just as importantly, \n                                                                                                 \n12 The Court gave as an example a prosecutor’s refusal to institute \ncriminal proceedings based on her “belief . . . that the law will not sustain \na conviction.”  BLE, 482 U.S. at 283.  Such a belief is not equivalent to \na  conclusion  that  the  government  lacked  the  power  to  institute  a \nprosecution in the first place.  For one colorful example, in Bond v. \nUnited States, prosecutors made the “surprising” decision to charge “an \namateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband’s lover” under the \nfederal statute implementing the international Convention on Chemical \nWeapons.  134 S. Ct. 2077, 2083–84 (2014).

If an agency head is mistaken in \nher assessment that the law precludes one course of action, \nallowing the courts to disabuse her of that incorrect view of \nthe law does not constrain discretion, but rather opens new \nvistas within which discretion can operate.  That is, if an \nadministrator chooses option A for the sole reason that she \nbelieves option B to be beyond her legal authority, a decision \nfrom the courts putting option B back on the table allows a \nreasoned,  discretionary  policy  choice  between  the  two \ncourses of action.  And if the agency’s view of the law is \ninstead confirmed by the courts, no injury to  discretion \nresults because the status quo is preserved. \nMoreover,  allowing  judicial  review  under  these \ncircumstances  serves  the  critical  function  of  promoting \naccountability  within  the  Executive  Branch—not \naccountability to the courts, but democratic accountability to \nthe people.  Accountability in this sense is fundamental to \nthe legitimacy of the administrative system: although they \nare “unelected . . . bureaucrats,” City of Arlington, 569 U.S. \nat 305, the heads of cabinet-level departments like DHS “are \nsubject to the exercise of political oversight and share the \nPresident’s  accountability  to  the  people.”    Freytag  v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 886 (1991).  \nIndeed,  the  Constitution’s  “Appointments  Clause  was \ndesigned to ensure public accountability for . . . the making \nof  a  bad  appointment  . . . .”    Edmond  v.

OF CAL. V. USDHS  47 \n \nThe  Montana  Air  rule  promotes  accountability  by \nensuring that the public knows where to place blame for an \nunpopular measure.  When an agency justifies an action \nsolely with an assertion that the law prohibits any other \ncourse, it shifts responsibility for the outcome  from the \nExecutive  Branch  to  Congress  (for  making  the  law  in \nquestion) or the courts (for construing it).  If the Executive \nis correct in its interpretation of the law, then the public is \ncorrect to blame the other two branches for any resulting \nproblems.  But if the Executive is wrong, then it avoids \ndemocratic accountability for a choice that was the agency’s \nto  make  all  along.    Allowing  the  judiciary—the  branch \nultimately responsible for interpreting the law, see Marbury, \n5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177—to review such decisions prevents \nthis anti-democratic and untoward outcome.  As Judge Bates \nof the District Court for the District of Columbia aptly put \nthe point in confronting the very issue we face here, “an \nofficial cannot claim that the law ties her hands while at the \nsame time denying the courts’ power to unbind her.  She may \nescape political accountability or judicial review, but not \nboth.”  NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 249 (D.D.C. \n2018). \nWe  therefore  must  determine  whether  the  Acting \nSecretary’s decision to end DACA was based solely on a \nbelief that the program was unlawful, such that the Chaney \npresumption does not apply.13 \n                                                                                                 \n13 Because we take this doctrinal course, we need not decide whether \nthe rescission of DACA would be reviewable absent the exception \nreflected in Montana Air and Chaney’s footnote four.  But we do note \nseveral points.  First, a literal reading of Chaney’s language would not \neven encompass the decision to rescind DACA, since Chaney by its own \nterms applies only to “agency decisions not to undertake enforcement \naction.”  470 U.S. at 832 (emphasis added).  Nowhere does the opinion \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e4 84 8o fo 9f 999\n48  REGENTS OF THE UNIV. OF CAL. V. USDHS \n \nWe take Attorney General Sessions literally at his word \nwhen he wrote to Acting Secretary Duke that “DACA was \neffectuated . . . without proper statutory authority,” and that \nDACA “was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the \nExecutive  Branch.”    These  are  the  reasons  he  gave  for \nadvising Acting Secretary Duke to rescind DACA.  We \n                                                                                                 \nsuggest the broader proposition that any decision simply related to \nenforcement should be presumed unreviewable.  Our court’s dicta in \nMorales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 827 n.4 (9th Cir. 2016), which \naddressed a completely separate issue of jurisdiction under the INA, is \nnot to the contrary.  Thus, to the extent that the Montana Air exception \nmight not seem a perfect fit for the rescission of DACA—which was not \nexactly a decision not to enforce—the Chaney presumption itself shares \nthe same defect.  There is no daylight between the Chaney rule and the \nMontana Air exception in terms of the type of agency action to which \nthey apply.  So if the rescission of DACA were outside the Montana Air \nexception by virtue of not being strictly a nonenforcement decision, it \nwould also fall outside the Chaney presumption of unreviewability in the \nfirst place. \nSecond, the D.C. Circuit has developed a line of cases explaining \nthat while Chaney bars judicial review of a “single-shot nonenforcement \ndecision,”  on  the  other  hand,  “an  agency’s  adoption  of  a  general \nenforcement policy is subject to review.”  OSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United \nStates, 132 F.3d 808, 812 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Crowley Caribbean \nTransp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 674–75 (D.C. Cir. 1994)); see also \nKenney v.

We take the term to refer to a \nconcern that DACA would be abruptly enjoined, regardless of whether \nthe program was illegal or not.

The “ongoing litigation” referenced is of course \nTexas v. United States, in which the Fifth Circuit upheld a \npreliminary injunction against the related DAPA policy, and \nthe Supreme Court affirmed by an equally divided vote.15  \nSee Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); Texas, 809 F.3d 134 (5th \nCir. 2015).  The “rulings” in that case are propositions of \nlaw—taken  alone,  they  are  more  readily  understood  as \nsupporting  a  legal  conclusion  (DACA  is  illegal)  than  a \npragmatic one (DACA might be enjoined).  The pragmatic \ninterpretation requires extra analytical steps (someone might \nsue to enjoin DACA, and they might win) that are entirely \nabsent from the list of factors that the Acting Secretary stated \nshe was “taking into consideration” in making her decision.  \nActing  Secretary  Duke  easily  could  have  included  “the \nprospect  of  litigation  challenging  DACA”  in  her  list  of \nconsiderations; had she done so, then perhaps the reference \nto the Texas litigation could be read as supporting a practical \nworry about an injunction.16  Absent that, however, the \nmention of the courts’ “rulings” is best read as referencing \nthe courts’ legal conclusions. \nAttorney General Sessions’s September 4, 2017, letter \nlikewise focuses on the supposed illegality of DACA, rather \n                                                                                                 \n15 This conclusion is only bolstered by the fact that the government’s \nproduction of the “administrative record” in this case includes the \nentirety of the three published judicial opinions in the Texas litigation. \n16 The Acting Secretary did reference Texas Attorney General Ken \nPaxton’s threat to amend the Texas suit to include DACA, but she did so \nin the “Background” section of her memorandum.  If anything, the \ninclusion of the threat in the background portion renders its omission \nfrom the list of factors the Acting Secretary was actually “[t]aking into \nconsideration” all the more stark. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e5 15 1o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Such an \nopen-ended  circumvention  of  immigration \nlaws  was  an  unconstitutional  exercise  of \nauthority by the Executive Branch. \n(emphases added). \nThese  sentences  unmistakably  reflect  the  Attorney \nGeneral’s  belief  that  DACA  was  illegal  and  therefore \nbeyond the power of DHS to institute or maintain.  The letter \ngoes on to opine that “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the \nsame  legal  and  constitutional  defects  that  the  courts \nrecognized as to DAPA [in the Texas litigation], it is likely \nthat  potentially  imminent  litigation  would  yield  similar \nresults with respect to DACA.”  But in the context of the full \nparagraph, the reference to “similar results” is best read not \nas an independent reason for rescinding DACA, but as a \nnatural consequence of DACA’s supposed illegality—which \nis the topic of the paragraph as a whole.  In the words of \nJudge Garaufis of the District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York, that reference “is too thin a reed to bear the \nweight of Defendants’ ‘litigation risk’ argument.”  Batalla \nVidal v.

In  his  June  15,  2017, \nmemorandum, Secretary Kelly wrote: \nAfter consulting with the Attorney General, \nand  in  the  exercise  of  my  discretion  in \nestablishing  national  immigration \nenforcement policies and priorities, I hereby \nrescind  the  November  20,  2014 \nmemorandum [that established DAPA]. \n(emphasis  added).    Placed  alongside  Acting  Secretary \nDuke’s language, the parallels—and the differences—are \nstark.  Acting Secretary Duke’s memorandum reads: \nIn the exercise of my authority in establishing \nnational immigration policies and priorities, \nexcept for the purposes explicitly identified \nbelow, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 \nmemorandum [that established DACA]. \n(emphasis added). \nThe  obvious  similarities  between  the  two  passages \nstrongly suggest that Acting Secretary Duke modeled her \nlanguage after that of Secretary Kelly’s memo.  And indeed, \nwe know that the Acting Secretary considered the Kelly \nmemorandum  in  reaching  her  decision,  because  the \ngovernment  has  told  us  so.    See  Petition  for  Writ  of \nMandamus, In re United States, No. 17-72917 (9th Cir.

ICE, 543 U.S. 335, 357 (2005) \n(“[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of \nthe  statute  and  different  language  in  another,  the  court \nassumes different meanings were intended.”).  The point is \nthat with the example set by the Kelly memorandum in front \nof her, Acting Secretary Duke clearly would have known \nhow to express that the rescission was a discretionary act—\nif  that  were  indeed  the  case.17    Furthermore,  the  near-\nverbatim  language  of  the  two  rescission  memoranda \nsuggests that the Acting Secretary adopted the majority of \nKelly’s wording, but actively rejected describing the DACA \nrescission  as  an  act  of  discretion.    This  difference  in \nlanguage  cuts  strongly  against  any  suggestion  that  the \nrescission was discretionary. \nThe  government  counters  that  the  memorandum \n“focused from beginning to end principally on litigation \nconcerns, not the legality of DACA per se.”  But as the State \nplaintiffs point out, the memorandum’s references to these \n                                                                                                 \n17 Secretary Kelly’s references to the factors he considered, which \nincluded  obviously  discretionary  considerations  such  as  “our  new \nimmigration enforcement priorities,” provided a further model for how \nto describe a discretionary decision, which Acting Secretary Duke also \nchose not to follow. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e5 45 4o fo 9f 999\n54  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

But even on \nits face, “should” is fully capable of expressing obligation or \nnecessity.    See,  e.g.,  Should,  New  Oxford  American \nDictionary (3d ed. 2010) (“used to indicate obligation, duty, \nor correctness”); cf. Should, Garner’s Dictionary of Legal \nUsage (3d ed. 2011) (“should . . . is sometimes used to create \nmandatory  standards”).    The  Acting  Secretary’s  use  of \n“should” instead of “must” cannot overcome the absence of \nany discussion of potential litigation or the “risks” attendant \nto  it  from  the  rescission  memorandum’s  statement  of \nreasons,  and  the  discrepancy  between  the  rescission  of \nDAPA as an act of “discretion” and the rescission of DACA \nas an act of “authority.” \nFinally, the government takes a quote from the Supreme \nCourt to the effect that courts should “uphold a decision of \nless than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be \ndiscerned,” Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., \nInc.,  419  U.S.  281,  286  (1974),  and  contorts  it  into  an \nargument that the district court’s “narrow reading of the \nActing Secretary’s rationale is hardly the only one that ‘may \nreasonably  be  discerned’  from  the  Acting  Secretary’s \nmemorandum.”  But Bowman is about finding a reviewable \nrationale in an agency’s action versus finding no articulation \nof that rationale.

The \ngovernment is in effect asking the court to defer to agency \ncounsel’s post-hoc rationalization, as long as there is some \nreading of the rescission memorandum—never mind how \nstrained—that would support it.  Bowman does not require \nthis incongruous result. \nWe agree with the district court that the Acting Secretary \nbased the rescission of DACA solely on a belief that DACA \nwas beyond the authority of DHS.  Under Montana Air and \nChaney’s footnote four, this conclusion brings the rescission \nwithin the realm of agency actions reviewable under the \nAPA.    Unless  the  INA  itself  deprives  the  courts  of \njurisdiction over this case, we must proceed to evaluate the \nmerits of plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim. \nB.  Jurisdiction under the INA \nThe  government  contends  that  the  INA  stripped  the \ndistrict court of its jurisdiction in a provision that states: \nExcept as provided in this section [which sets \nout avenues of review not applicable here] \n. . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear \nany cause or claim by or on behalf of any \nalien arising from the decision or action by \nthe  [Secretary  of  Homeland  Security]  to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or \nexecute  removal  orders  against  any  alien \nunder this chapter. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e5 65 6o fo 9f 999\n56  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

USDHS \n \nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that this section \n“applies only to three discrete actions that the [Secretary] \nmay  take:  her  ‘decision  or  action’  to  ‘commence \nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 482 (emphasis in original).  As the Court \nput it, “[i]t is implausible that the mention of three discrete \nevents along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of \nreferring to all claims arising from deportation proceedings.  \nNot because Congress is too unpoetic to use synecdoche, but \nbecause that literary device is incompatible with the need for \nprecision in legislative drafting.”  Id. \nThe government attempts to expand Section 1252(g) to \nencompass this case in two ways.  First, it points out that the \nAADC Court read that provision as Congress’s effort to \nshield executive decisions not to grant deferred action from \nreview outside the procedures prescribed by the INA.  The \nCourt quoted a treatise describing the practice of deferred \naction  and  the  litigation  that  would  result  when  the \ngovernment declined to grant deferred action: “Efforts to \nchallenge the refusal to exercise such discretion on behalf of \nspecific aliens sometimes have been favorably considered by \nthe courts . . . .”  Id. at 484–85 (quoting 6 Charles Gordon et \nal., Immigration Law and Procedure § 72.03[2][h] (1998)).  \nHaving reviewed these developments, the Court concluded: \n“Section  1252(g)  seems  clearly  designed  to  give  some \nmeasure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and \nsimilar discretionary determinations. . . .”  Id. at 485. \nThe government argues that AADC’s reasoning—and \ntherefore  Section  1252(g)—applies  to  the  rescission  of \nDACA, which is itself in some sense a “no deferred action” \ndecision.  It seems quite clear, however, that AADC reads \nSection 1252(g) as responding to litigation over individual \n“no deferred action” decisions, rather than a programmatic \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e5 75 7o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

(emphasis added).  And in any case, the holding of AADC \nwas  explicit:  “The  provision  applies  only  to  [the]  three \ndiscrete actions” mentioned in the statute.  Id. at 482. \nThe government’s fallback argument is thus to cast the \nrescission of DACA as an initial “action” in the agency’s \n“commence[ment] [of] proceedings.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  \nBut AADC specifically rejected a broad reading of the three \ndiscrete actions listed in Section 1252(g).  “[D]ecisions to \nopen an investigation, [or] to surveil the suspected violator” \nare  not  included  in  Section  1252(g)’s  jurisdictional  bar, \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 482, even though these actions are also \n“part of the deportation process,” id., and could similarly be \nconstrued  as  incremental  steps  toward  an  eventual \n“commence[ment] [of] proceedings,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \nIndeed, in a case closely on point, our court rejected the \napplication of Section 1252(g) and allowed to proceed a \nchallenge to INS guidance narrowly interpreting the terms of \na  “one-time  legalization  program”  for  undocumented \nimmigrants.  See Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc. v. INS, 232 F.3d \n1139, 1141 (9th Cir. 2000).  We noted that “[a]s interpreted \nby the Supreme Court in [AADC], [Section 1252(g)] applies \nonly to the three specific discretionary actions mentioned in \nits text, not to all claims relating in any way to deportation \nproceedings,” and held that the challenge was not barred.

We next \nmust decide whether that legal conclusion was correct.21 \nAttorney General Sessions’s September 4, 2017, letter \nexpresses several possible bases for the agency’s ultimate \nconclusion that DACA was unlawful.  First, the Attorney \nGeneral states that “DACA was effectuated by the previous \nadministration  through  executive  action  . . .  after \nCongress’[s] repeated rejection of proposed legislation that \nwould have accomplished a similar result.”  But our court \nhas already explained that “Congress’s failure to pass the \n[DREAM] Act does not signal the illegitimacy of the DACA \nprogram,” partly because “the DREAM Act and the DACA \nprogram  are  not  interchangeable  policies  because  they \nprovide different forms of relief”: the DREAM Act would \nhave provided a path to lawful permanent resident status, \nwhile DACA simply defers removal.  Brewer II, 855 F.3d at \n976 n.10; see Motomura, supra, at 175 (“DACA is not the \nDREAM Act; as an interim executive measure, it is limited \nin duration and provides no durable immigration status.”) \n(footnote omitted);  see also, e.g., DREAM Act of 2011, S. \n952,  112th  Cong.  (2011).    Moreover,  there  is  nothing \ninherently  problematic  about  an  agency  addressing  a \nproblem for which Congress has been unable to pass a \nlegislative  fix,  so  long  as  the  particular  action  taken  is \nproperly  within  the  agency’s  power.    This  argument \ntherefore  provides  no  independent  reason  to  think  that \nDACA is unlawful. \n                                                                                                 \n21 The government does not argue that its conclusion is entitled to \nChevron  deference,  likely  because  “[d]eference  to  an  agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute is not appropriate when the agency wrongly \n‘believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress.’”  Gila River \nIndian Cmty. v.

USDHS \n \nThe Attorney General’s primary bases for concluding \nthat  DACA  was  illegal  were  that  the  program  was \n“effectuated . . . without proper statutory authority” and that \nit amounted to “an unconstitutional exercise of authority.”  \nMore specifically, the Attorney General asserted that “the \nDACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects \nthat  the  courts  recognized  as  to  DAPA”  in  the  Texas \nlitigation. \nThe claim of “constitutional defects” is a puzzling one \nbecause as all the parties recognize, no court has ever held \nthat DAPA is unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit and district \ncourt  in  Texas  explicitly  declined  to  address  the \nconstitutional issue.  See Texas, 809 F.3d at 154 (“We decide \nthis appeal . . . without resolving the constitutional claim.”); \nTexas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 677 (“[T]he Court is specifically not \naddressing  Plaintiffs’  likelihood  of  success  on  . . .  their \nconstitutional claims . . . .”).  Indeed, the government makes \nno attempt in this appeal to defend the Attorney General’s \nassertion that the DACA program is unconstitutional.  We \ntherefore do not address it further. \nWith respect to DACA’s alleged “legal . . . defects,” the \ndistrict court explained in great detail the long history of \ndeferred action in immigration enforcement, including in the \nform of broad programs; the fact that the Supreme Court and \nCongress  have  both  acknowledged  deferred  action  as  a \nfeature of the immigration system; and the specific statutory \nresponsibility of the Secretary of Homeland Security for \n“[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies \nand priorities,” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  The government does not \ncontest any of these propositions, which themselves go a \nlong way toward establishing DACA’s legality.

See  Texas, \n809 F.3d at 171–78, 178–86. \nWith respect to the first holding, notice-and-comment \nprocedures  are  not  required  where  the  agency \npronouncement  in  question  is  a  “general  statement[]  of \npolicy.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A).  “The critical factor to \ndetermine  whether  a  directive  announcing  a  new  policy \nconstitutes a rule or a general statement of policy is the \nextent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, \nor its implementing official, free to exercise discretion to \nfollow,  or  not  to  follow,  the  [announced]  policy  in  an \nindividual case.”  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, \n1013  (9th  Cir.  1987)  (alterations  in  original)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nOn  its  face,  DACA  obviously  allows  (and  indeed \nrequires) DHS officials to exercise discretion in making \ndeferred action decisions as to individual cases: Secretary \nNapolitano’s memorandum announcing DACA specifically \nstates that “requests for relief pursuant to this memorandum \nare to be decided on a case by case basis.”  The Fifth Circuit \nin  Texas  held  that  DAPA  was  a  substantive  rule \nnotwithstanding  similar  discretionary  language,  based \nprimarily on statistics regarding the approval rates of DACA \napplications.  The court read those statistics as revealing that \nDACA was discretionary in name only—that is, that DHS \npersonnel had no discretion to deny deferred action if the \nDACA criteria were met.

OF CAL. V. USDHS \n \nBut  as  the  dissenting  judge  in  Texas  pointed  out, \nDACA’s  (then)  5%  denial  rate—which  did  not  include \napplications  rejected  for  administrative  deficiencies—is \nconsistent with a discretionary program given that applicants \nself-select: “It should be expected that only those highly \nlikely  to  receive  deferred  action  will  apply;  otherwise, \napplicants would risk revealing their immigration status and \nother identifying information to authorities, thereby risking \nremoval (and the loss of a sizeable fee).”  Texas, 809 F.3d at \n210 (King, J., dissenting). \nMoreover,  the  denial  rate  has  risen  as  the  DACA \nprogram has matured.  DHS statistics included in the record \nreveal that in fiscal year 2016, for example, the agency \napproved  52,882  initial  DACA  applications  and  denied \n11,445; that is, 17.8% of the applications acted upon were \ndenied.22    As  Judge  King  concluded,  “Neither  of  these \nnumbers suggests an agency on autopilot.”  Texas, 809 F.3d \nat 210 n.44 (King, J., dissenting); see also Arpaio v. Obama, \n27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 209 n.13 (D.D.C. 2014) (noting that \nthese same statistics “reflect that . . . case-by-case review is \nin operation”).23  In light of these differences, we do not \n                                                                                                 \n22 U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, Number of Form I-\n821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, by \nFiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year \n2012–2017 (March 31, 2017).  The number of initial applications is the \nrelevant metric because renewal applications are by definition limited to \nthe pool of those already approved for DACA at least once.  Therefore, \none would expect an even lower denial rate for renewals. \n23 Judge King’s dissent also makes the critical observation that, \naccording to the declarations filed in that case, the reason DHS could not \npoint to specific instances in which DACA applicants met the program \ncriteria but were denied as a matter of discretion was that DHS did not \nhave the ability to track and sort the reasons for DACA denials.

Specifically, the Fifth \nCircuit reasoned that the INA provides “an intricate process \nfor illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification \nfrom their children’s immigration status” but that “DAPA \nwould allow illegal aliens to receive the benefits of lawful \npresence solely on account of their children’s immigration \nstatus without complying with any of the requirements . . . \nthat Congress has deliberately imposed.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at \n179–80.  As the district court in this case noted, there is no \nanalogous provision in the INA defining how immigration \nstatus may be derived by undocumented persons who arrived \nin the United States as children.  One of the major problems \nthe  Fifth  Circuit  identified  with  DAPA  is  therefore  not \npresent here. \nIn resisting this conclusion, the government flips the \nFifth Circuit’s reasoning on its head, arguing that “[i]nsofar \nas the creation of pathways to lawful presence was relevant, \nthe  fact  that  Congress  had  legislated  only  for  certain \nindividuals similarly situated to DAPA beneficiaries—and \nnot  DACA  recipients—would  make  DACA  more \ninconsistent with the INA than DAPA.”  To the extent the \ngovernment meant to draw on the Texas court’s analysis, it \ngets it exactly backwards: the whole thrust of the Fifth \nCircuit’s reasoning on this point was that DHS was without \nauthority  because  “Congress  has  ‘directly  addressed  the \nprecise question at issue.’”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186 (quoting \nMayo Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, \n562 U.S. 44, 52 (2011)).

USDHS \n \nthe Attorney General himself noted, Congress has repeatedly \nrejected Dreamer legislation. \nThe second major element of the Fifth Circuit’s analysis \non the substantive issues was that the INA itself “prescribes \n. . . which classes of aliens can achieve deferred action and \neligibility for work authorization.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186.  \nThe court drew the implication that the statute must therefore \npreclude the Executive Branch from granting these benefits \nto other classes.  Id. (pairing this notion with the pathway-\nto-lawful-presence argument as the keys to its conclusion). \nBut “[t]he force of any negative implication . . . depends \non context.” Marx v. Gen.

Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, \n168 (2003).  Here, the express grants of deferred action cited \nby the Fifth Circuit were not passed together as part of the \noriginal INA; rather, they were added to the statute books \npiecemeal over time by Congress.  See Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, div.

We  think  the  much  more \nreasonable conclusion is that in passing its seriatim pieces of \nlegislation, instructing that this and that “narrow class[]” of \nnoncitizens should be eligible for deferred action, Texas, \n809 F.3d at 179, Congress meant to say nothing at all about \nthe underlying power of the Executive Branch to grant the \nsame remedy to others.  We do not read an “and no one else” \nclause into each of Congress’s individual express grants of \ndeferred action. \nAnother element in the Fifth Circuit’s analysis was that \n“DAPA would make 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens \neligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and \nassociated benefits, and ‘we must be guided to a degree by \ncommon sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely \nto delegate a policy decision of such economic and political \nmagnitude to an administrative agency.’”  Id. at 181 (quoting \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n133  (2000)).    DACA,  on  the  other  hand,  had  689,800 \nenrollees as of September 2017.  The government asserts that \nthis  difference  in  size  is  “legally  immaterial,”  but  that \nresponse is unconvincing.  If the point is that the “economic \nand political magnitude” of allowing 4.3 million people to \nremain in the country and obtain work authorization is such \nthat Congress would have spoken to it directly, then surely \nit makes a difference that one policy has less than one-sixth \nthe “magnitude” of the other.  Id.  As the district court \nlaconically put it, “there is a difference between 4.3 million \nand 689,800.” \nFinally,  the  government  finds  “an  insurmountable \nobstacle to plaintiffs’ position” in that “the district court’s \ninjunction affirmed by the Fifth Circuit covered both DAPA \nand expanded DACA.”  It is true that the Texas court also \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e6 86 8o fo 9f 999\n68  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

See Texas, \n809  F.3d  at  147  n.11  (“The  district  court  enjoined \nimplementation of the following three DACA expansions, \nand they are included in the term ‘DAPA’ in this opinion \n. . . .”).  But no analysis was devoted to those provisions by \neither the Fifth Circuit or the Texas district court, and one of \nthe keys to the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning—that Congress had \nsupposedly  occupied  the  field  with  respect  to  obtaining \nimmigration  benefits  through  one’s  children—does  not \napply to either the original DACA program or its expansions.  \nUnder these circumstances, we do not find the Texas courts’ \ntreatment of the DACA expansions to be strong persuasive \nauthority,  much  less  an  “insurmountable  obstacle.”    Cf. \nBryan A. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 170 \n(2016) (“An authority derives its persuasive power from its \nability to convince others to go along with it.”). \nIn sum, the reality is (and always has been) that the \nexecutive agencies charged with immigration enforcement \ndo not have the resources required to deport every single \nperson  present  in  this  country  without  authorization.  \nCompare Bernsen Memorandum, supra, at 1 (stating, in \n1976,  that  “[t]here  simply  are  not  enough  resources  to \nenforce all of the rules and regulations presently on the \nbooks”), with Memorandum from John Morton, Assistant \nSecretary, DHS, Civil Immigration Enforcement: Priorities \nfor the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens, at \n1 (June 30, 2010) (estimating that ICE has enough resources \nto deport only 4% of the undocumented population in any \ngiven year, and concluding that “ICE must prioritize the use \nof its . . . removal resources to ensure the removals the \nagency  does  conduct  promote  the  agency’s  highest \nenforcement priorities”) and Motomura, supra, at 26 (“The \nletter of the law creates a large removable population, but \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e6 96 9o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

Recognizing  this  state  of  affairs, \nCongress has explicitly charged the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity  with  “[e]stablishing  national  immigration \nenforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5). \nIt is therefore no surprise that deferred action has been a \nfeature of our immigration system—albeit one of executive \ninvention—for decades; has been employed categorically on \nnumerous occasions; and has been recognized as a practical \nreality by both Congress and the courts.  See, e.g., Brewer II, \n855 F.3d at 967 (“[I]t is well settled that the Secretary [of \nHomeland Security] can exercise deferred action” as part of \nher statutory authority “to administer and enforce all laws \nrelating to immigration and naturalization.”).  In a world \nwhere the government can remove only a small percentage \nof the undocumented noncitizens present in this country in \nany year, deferred action programs like DACA enable DHS \nto devote much-needed resources to enforcement priorities \nsuch as threats to national security, rather than blameless and \neconomically productive young people with clean criminal \nrecords. \nWe therefore conclude that DACA was a permissible \nexercise of executive discretion, notwithstanding the Fifth \nCircuit’s  conclusion  that  the  related  DAPA  program \nexceeded  DHS’s  statutory  authority.    DACA  is  being \nimplemented in a manner that reflects discretionary, case-\nby-case review, and at least one of the Fifth Circuit’s key \nrationales  in  striking  down  DAPA  is  inapplicable  with \nrespect to DACA.  With respect for our sister circuit, we find \nthe analysis that seemingly compelled the result in Texas \nentirely inapposite.

We \nhold only that here, where the Executive did not make a \ndiscretionary choice to end DACA—but rather acted based \non  an  erroneous  view  of  what  the  law  required—the \nrescission was arbitrary and capricious under settled law.  \nThe government is, as always, free to reexamine its policy \nchoices, so long as doing so does not violate an injunction or \nany freestanding statutory or constitutional protection.24 \nV. \nHaving concluded that the district court was correct in its \nAPA merits holding, we now turn to the question of the \nappropriate  remedy.    The  district  court  preliminarily \n                                                                                                 \n24 The government has submitted a letter pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Appellate Procedure 28(j), informing us that the current Secretary of \nHomeland  Security,  Kirstjen  Nielsen,  issued  a  new  memorandum \nregarding the DACA rescission on June 22, 2018.  In the memorandum, \nSecretary Nielsen “provide[d] additional explanation of the basis for the \nDACA rescission,” in response to an order filed in a parallel lawsuit.  \nThe government’s letter does not argue that the Nielsen memorandum \nrepresents fresh agency action that could possibly moot this appeal.  We \ntherefore leave it to the district court in the first instance to determine the \nadmissibility of Secretary Nielsen’s letter given that it cannot possibly \nbe a part of the administrative record in this case, and its impact, if any, \non this case.  And to the extent the Nielsen memorandum is offered as \nan additional justification of the original DACA rescission, we do not \nconsider it in our review of Acting Secretary Duke’s decision because it \nis well-settled that “we will not allow the agency to supply post-hoc \nrationalizations for its actions . . . .”  San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water \nAuth. v.

The government asserts \nthat this was error, and that a proper injunction would be \nnarrower. \nThe  general  rule  regarding  the  scope  of  preliminary \ninjunctive relief is that it “should be no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to \nthe plaintiffs before the court.”  L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal citation \nomitted).  But “[t]here is no general requirement that an \ninjunction affect only the parties in the suit.”  Bresgal v. \nBrock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 1987); see also id. at \n1170–71 (“[A]n injunction is not necessarily made over-\nbroad by extending benefit or protection to persons other \nthan prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a class \naction—if  such  breadth  is  necessary  to  give  prevailing \nparties the relief to which they are entitled.”) (emphasis in \noriginal). \nIt is also important to note that the claim underlying the \ninjunction  here  is  an  arbitrary-and-capricious  challenge \nunder the APA.

Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 913 (1990) \n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (citation omitted). \nA final principle is also relevant: the need for uniformity \nin immigration policy.  See Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, \n701 (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2392 \n(2018) (“Because this case implicates immigration policy, a \nnationwide injunction was necessary to give Plaintiffs a full \nexpression of their rights.”).  As the Fifth Circuit stated when \nit affirmed the nationwide injunction against DAPA, “the \nConstitution requires an uniform Rule of Naturalization; \nCongress has instructed that the immigration laws of the \nUnited States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly; \nand the Supreme Court has described immigration policy as \na comprehensive and unified system.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at \n187–88  (emphases  in  original)  (citations  and  internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Allowing uneven application of \nnationwide immigration policy flies in the face of these \nrequirements. \nIn its briefing, the government fails to explain how the \ndistrict court could have crafted a narrower injunction that \nwould provide complete relief to the plaintiffs, including the \nentity plaintiffs.  Cf. Washington v.

Nor  does  it  provide  compelling  reasons  to \ndeviate from the normal rule in APA cases, or to disregard \nthe need for uniformity in national immigration policy.  The \none  argument  it  does  offer  on  this  latter  point—that \n“[d]eferred action is itself a departure from vigorous and \nuniform enforcement of the immigration laws,” and that \n“enjoining the rescission of DACA on a nationwide basis . . . \nincreases  rather  than  lessens  that  departure”—is  a  red \nherring.    DACA  is  national  immigration  policy,  and  an \ninjunction that applies that policy to some individuals while \nrescinding it as to others is inimical to the principle of \nuniformity. \nWe therefore conclude that the district court did not \nabuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction.  Such \nrelief is commonplace in APA cases, promotes uniformity in \nimmigration enforcement, and is necessary to provide the \nplaintiffs here with complete redress. \nVI. \nWe turn next to the district court’s treatment of the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  \nThe government moved to dismiss all of plaintiffs’ claims; \nthe district court dismissed some claims and denied the \ngovernment’s motion as to others.

APA: Arbitrary-and-Capricious  \nFor the reasons stated above in discussing plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success on the merits, the district court was \ncorrect  to  deny  the  government’s  motion  to  dismiss \nplaintiffs’ claim that the DACA rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nB.  APA: Notice-and-Comment  \nPlaintiffs also assert that the rescission of DACA is in \nfact a substantive rule under the APA, and that it therefore \ncould  not  be  validly  accomplished  without  notice-and-\ncomment procedures. \nAs touched on above with respect to DACA itself, an \nagency  pronouncement  is  excluded  from  the  APA’s \nrequirement  of  notice-and-comment  procedures  if  it \nconstitutes  a  “general  statement[]  of  policy.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(A).  General statements of policy are those that \n“advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the \nagency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Mada-\nLuna, 813 F.2d at 1012–13 (quoting Attorney General’s \nManual on the Administrative Procedure Act 30 n.3 (1947)).  \n“To qualify as a general statement of policy . . . a directive \nmust not establish a binding norm and must leave agency \nofficials free to consider the individual facts in the various \ncases that arise and to exercise discretion.”  Id. at 1015 \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 1013 (“The \ncritical factor to determine whether a directive announcing a \nnew policy constitutes a rule or a general statement of policy \nis the extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the \nagency,  or  its  implementing  official,  free  to  exercise \ndiscretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy \nin  an  individual  case.”  (alterations  in  original)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e7 57 5o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV. OF CAL. V. USDHS  75 \n \nThe district court held that because DACA itself was a \ngeneral statement of policy that did not require notice and \ncomment,  it  could  also  be  rescinded  without  those \nprocedures.  This proposition finds support in Mada-Luna, \nin which “we conclude[d] that [a deferred-action Operating \nInstruction] constituted a general statement of policy, and \nthus  could  be  validly  repealed  and  superseded  without \nnotice-and-comment proceedings.”  Id. at 1017.  Plaintiffs \ncontest this conclusion, arguing that the DACA rescission \nwas a binding rule, even though DACA’s adoption was a \ngeneral statement of policy.  They provide two bases for this \nassertion. \nFirst,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  rescission  is  binding \nbecause  it  requires  DHS  officials  to  reject  new  DACA \napplications and (after a certain date) renewal applications.  \nIt  is  true  that  Acting  Secretary  Duke’s  rescission \nmemorandum  makes  rejections  of  DACA  applications \nmandatory.  But the relevant question under the rescission \nmemorandum  is  not  whether  DHS  officials  retained \ndiscretion to accept applications for a program that no longer \nexisted;  instead,  the  question  is  whether  DHS  officials \nretained discretion to grant deferred action and collateral \nbenefits outside of the (now-cancelled) DACA program. \nFor its part, the government asserts that the rescission \nmemorandum made clear that, despite the rescission, “future \ndeferred action requests will be ‘adjudicat[ed] . . . on an \nindividual, case-by-case basis.’”  Mildly put, this assertion \nmischaracterizes the memorandum.  The quoted language \nrefers to the treatment of only (a) initial applications pending \non the date of the rescission, and (b) renewal applications \nfiled within the one-month wind-down period.  It does not \nrefer to how future requests for deferred action outside the \nDACA program would be handled.  Still, the rescission \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e7 67 6o fo 9f 999\n76  REGENTS OF THE UNIV. OF CAL. V. USDHS \n \nmemorandum also did not forbid the agency from granting \nsuch requests, and it acknowledged the background principle \nof deferred action  as “an act of prosecutorial  discretion \nmeant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case \nbasis.”  And the memorandum closed by stating that “no \nlimitations are placed by this guidance on the otherwise \nlawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS”—\npresumably including granting deferred action on a case-by-\ncase basis to some people who would have been eligible for \nDACA. \nIf allowed to go into effect, the rescission of DACA \nwould undoubtedly result in the loss of deferred action for \nthe vast majority of the 689,800 people who rely on the \nprogram.  But the rescission memorandum does not mandate \nthat  result  because  it  leaves  in  place  the  background \nprinciple that deferred action is available on a case-by-case \nbasis.26  Plaintiffs’ primary argument against this conclusion \nis a citation to United States ex rel. Parco v. Morris, 426 F. \nSupp. 976 (E.D. Pa. 1977), which is said to be “the only other \ndecision  to  address  an  Executive  Branch  decision  to \nterminate  a  deferred-action  program  without  undergoing \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.”  But as the district court \nnoted, the key factor in that case was the contention that \nunder  the  policy  at  issue,  “‘discretion’  was  exercised \nfavorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal \nof the regulation, unfavorably in each such case.”  Parco, \n                                                                                                 \n26 The Regents argue that “the agency’s discretion to grant deferred \naction on the basis of the DACA criteria has been eliminated.”  This is \nnot quite right either.  DHS’s authority to grant deferred action under the \nDACA program has been eliminated, but the DACA criteria themselves \nare  some  of  those  that  have  traditionally  guided  immigration \nenforcement discretion.  See Wadhia, supra, at 57 (“DHS used traditional \nhumanitarian factors to outline the parameters for the DACA program, \nsuch as tender age and longtime residence in the United States.”). \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e7 77 7o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

DACA,  by  contrast,  explicitly \ncontemplated  case-by-case  discretion,  and  its  rescission \nappears  to  have  left  in  place  background  principles  of \nprosecutorial discretion. \nPlaintiffs also argue that the DACA rescission is not a \ngeneral policy statement because it is binding as a legal \ninterpretation that a DACA-like program would be illegal.  \nBut again, this argument answers the wrong question.  The \nActing  Secretary’s  legal  conclusion  that  a  DACA-like \nprogram is unlawful does not constrain the discretion of line-\nlevel DHS employees to grant deferred action on a case-by-\ncase basis, and those employees lack authority to institute \nsuch  an  agency-wide  program  in  the  first  place.    And \nplaintiffs  do  not  point  to  any  reason  why  this  Acting \nSecretary’s  legal  conclusion  about  DACA  would  bind \nsubsequent  Secretaries  if  they  were  to  disagree  with  its \nreasoning—just as Acting Secretary Duke reversed course \nfrom previous Secretaries who concluded DACA was legal.  \nThis is not a “new ‘binding rule of substantive law,’” Mada-\nLuna, 813 F.2d at 1014, affecting the rights of the people and \nentities regulated by the agency; it is an interpretation of the \nagency’s own power, and plaintiffs do not explain why it \nshould be read as binding future DHS Secretaries.  The \ndistrict  court  correctly  dismissed  plaintiffs’  notice-and-\ncomment claims. \nC.  Due Process: Deferred Action \nThe Garcia plaintiffs—individual DACA recipients—\nhave brought a substantive due process claim alleging that \nthe rescission deprived them of protected interests in their \nDACA designation, including the renewal of their benefits.  \nThe district court dismissed this claim, holding that there is \nno protected entitlement in either the initial grant of deferred \naction under DACA or the renewal of benefits for existing \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e7 87 8o fo 9f 999\n78  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

On appeal, the Garcia plaintiffs challenge \nthis  ruling  only  as  it  applies  to  the  renewal  of  DACA \nbenefits, not as to the initial grant. \n“A threshold requirement to a substantive or procedural \ndue process claim is the plaintiff’s showing of a liberty or \nproperty  interest  protected  by  the  Constitution.”  \nWedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, \n62 (9th Cir. 1994).  It is possible to have a property interest \nin a government benefit, but “a person clearly must have \nmore than an abstract need or desire for [the benefit]. He \nmust have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, \ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.”  Bd. of \nRegents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  \nAlthough  “a  benefit  is  not  a  protected  entitlement  if \ngovernment  officials  may  grant  or  deny  it  in  their \ndiscretion,” Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, \n756 (2005), a legitimate claim of entitlement may exist \nwhere there are “rules or mutually explicit understandings \nthat support [a plaintiff’s] claim of entitlement to the benefit \n. . . .”  Perry v.

The  dispute  here  focuses  on  whether  such \n“mutually  explicit  understandings”  existed  between  the \ngovernment  and  DACA  recipients  with  respect  to  the \nrenewal of DACA benefits. \nThe Garcia plaintiffs assert that they and the government \n“‘mutually’ understood that DACA recipients would be able \nto renew their benefits and protection on an ongoing basis so \nlong  as  they  fulfilled  the  program’s  criteria.”    But  this \nargument is undercut by the DACA FAQs published by \nDHS, which explicitly state that “USCIS retains the ultimate \ndiscretion  to  determine  whether  deferred  action  is \nappropriate  in  any  given  case  even  if  the  [renewal] \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e7 97 9o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

First, they \nsay, the very nature of the DACA project was such that \npresumptive renewal was required to encourage people to \nparticipate; a two-year term with no presumption of renewal \nwould not have been attractive enough to outweigh the risks \nto the applicants.  Moreover, Secretary Napolitano’s DACA \nmemorandum  itself  states  that  grants  of  deferred  action \nunder DACA will be “subject to renewal,” and the actual \ncriteria  for  renewal  were  “nondiscretionary”  in  nature.27  \nFinally, the plaintiffs point to a more than 99% approval rate \nfor adjudicated DACA renewal applications.  This, they \nassert, is powerful evidence of a mutual understanding of \npresumptive renewal. \n                                                                                                 \n27 DHS’s DACA FAQs state that “[y]ou may be considered for \nrenewal of DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial \nDACA (see above) AND you: [1] Did not depart the United States on or \nafter Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole; [2] Have continuously \nresided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request \nfor DACA that was approved up to the present time; and [3] Have not \nbeen convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more \nmisdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or \npublic safety.” \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e8 08 0o fo 9f 999\n80  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

USDHS \n \nAll these points might have revealed a question of fact as \nto whether a mutually explicit understanding of presumptive \nrenewal  existed—thereby  avoiding  dismissal  on  the \npleadings—if  plaintiffs  were  bringing  a  claim  that,  for \nexample, their individual DACA renewals were denied for \nno good reason.  But it is hard to see how an expectation of \nrenewal within the confines of the existing DACA policy \ncould have created a mutually explicit understanding that the \nDACA program itself would not be terminated wholesale.  \nThat  is,  a  99%  renewal  rate  under  DACA  provides  no \nevidence that the government shared an understanding that \nthe DACA program would continue existing indefinitely to \nprovide such renewals.  None of plaintiffs’ cited authorities \nappear to address this kind of claim. \nWhile we may agree with much of what plaintiffs say \nabout the cruelty of ending a program upon which so many \nhave come to rely, we do not believe they have plausibly \nalleged a “mutually explicit understanding” that DACA—\ncreated by executive action in a politically polarized policy \narea  and  explicitly  couched  in  discretionary  language—\nwould  exist  indefinitely,  including  through  a  change  in \npresidential administrations.  See Gerhart, 637 F.3d at 1020 \n(“A person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, \nno matter how sincerely or reasonably held, does not create \na property right if that belief is not mutually held by the \ngovernment.”).  On that basis, we affirm the district court’s \ndismissal. \nD.

The statement that applicant information \n“is protected from disclosure” to the enforcement arms of \nDHS is a strong commitment, and plaintiffs plausibly allege \nthat DACA recipients reasonably relied on it. \nThe government of course points to the express caveat \nthat  the  information-sharing  policy  “may  be  modified, \nsuperseded or rescinded at any time.”  But as the district \ncourt held, this qualifier is ambiguous as to whether it allows \nthe government to change its policy only prospectively, or \nalso with respect to information already received—and this \nambiguity  presents  a  fact  question  not  amenable  to \nresolution on the pleadings.  Plaintiffs’ interpretation that a \npolicy change would only apply prospectively is a plausible \none, given that the policy is written in terms of what will \nhappen to “[i]nformation provided in this request,” rather \nthan  DACA-derived  information  generally.  (emphasis \nadded).  It is at least reasonable to think that a change in the \npolicy would apply only to those applications submitted after \nthat change takes effect.  And while the government also \nrelies on the language stating that the policy does not create \nenforceable rights, such a disclaimer by an agency about \nwhat its statements do and do not constitute as a legal matter \nare not dispositive.  See, e.g., Appalachian Power Co. v. \nEPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1022–23 (D.C.

Plaintiffs’ allegations rest on a set of FAQs about the \nDACA rescission that DHS published the same day it issued \nthe rescission memorandum, September 5, 2017.  In those \nrescission FAQs, the previous language stating that personal \ninformation “is protected from disclosure” has been replaced \nwith the following: \nInformation provided to USCIS in DACA \nrequests will not be proactively provided to \nICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration \nenforcement  proceedings,  unless  the \nrequestor meets the criteria for the issuance \nof a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE \nunder the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice \nto Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA). \n(emphasis added). \nThe  government’s  first  response—that  the  differing \nlanguage  in  the  two  FAQs  does  not  actually  reflect  a \ndifference in policy—is hard to swallow.  It does not take \nmuch parsing of the text to see the significant difference \nbetween “protect[ing]” something from “disclosure” on the \none hand, and merely declining to “proactively provide[]” it \non the other.  This is especially so when the entities in \nquestion  (and  to  which  USCIS  presumably  would  now \nprovide information reactively) are fellow components of \nthe same umbrella agency. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e8 48 4o fo 9f 999\n84  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

This \ninformation-sharing policy has not changed \nin  any  way  since  it  was  first  announced, \nincluding as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017 \nmemo starting a wind-down of the DACA \npolicy. \nUSCIS, Guidance on Rejected DACA Requests: Frequently \nAsked Questions (Nov. 30, 2017) (emphases added).

See \nBatalla  Vidal  v.  Nielsen,  291  F.  Supp.  3d  260,  279–81 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2018). \nBut this case is critically different because in Batalla \nVidal the plaintiffs had attached the new version of the FAQs \nto their complaint.  As the court there explained, “Plaintiffs \n. . . have effectively pleaded themselves out of court by \nrelying  on  a  document  that  contradicts  their  otherwise-\nunsupported allegation of a change to DHS’s information-\nuse policy.”  Id. at 280.

See  USCIS,  Guidance,  supra \n(“[I]nformation will only be proactively provided to ICE or \nCBP if the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a \nNotice To Appear[.]”) (emphasis added).28  Plaintiffs have \nplausibly alleged that DHS has changed its policy. \nFinally, in order to state a substantive due process claim, \nplaintiffs must allege conduct that “shock[s] the conscience \nand  offend[s]  the  community’s  sense  of  fair  play  and \ndecency.”  Sylvia Landfield Tr. v.

See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.  The \ncomplaints also allege a history of animus toward persons of \nHispanic descent29 evidenced by both pre-presidential and \npost-presidential30 statements by President Trump, who is \nalleged to have decided to end DACA, even though the \ndirective to the Acting Secretary was issued from Attorney \nGeneral  Sessions.    Finally,  the  district  court  properly \nconsidered “the unusual history behind the rescission,”  all \nof  which  appeared  in  the  record  submitted  by  the \ngovernment.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267.  As the \ndistrict court noted, “DACA received reaffirmation by the \nagency as recently as three months before the rescission, \nonly to be hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a \ncontrived  excuse (its purported illegality).

The government first submits that nationality, as \nopposed to ethnicity, is not an invidious classification, and that many of \nthe cited comments go only to Mexican nationality.  “Often, however, \nthe two are identical as a factual matter: one was born in the nation whose \nprimary stock is one’s own ethnic group.”  St. Francis Coll. v. Al-\nKhazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 614 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring).  And \nplaintiffs  allege  discriminatory  intent  not  only  toward  “Mexican \nnationals,”  but  also  toward  “individuals  of  Mexican  heritage,  and \nLatinos.” \n30 The district court took judicial notice of one such statement by the \nPresident: “[o]n December 29, 2017, President Trump tweeted: ‘The \nDemocrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no \nDACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border \nand an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System \nof Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!’”  There \nwere many similar statements made by the President after he took the \noath of office leading up to the DACA rescission on September 5, 2017. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e8 88 8o fo 9f 999\n88  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

But in the context of this case, the challenge to the \nrescission of DACA is not raised “as a defense against [] \ndeportation,” and is not a claim of “selective enforcement.”  \nId.  Rather, it is a freestanding claim that the Executive \nBranch,  motivated  by  animus,  ended  a  program  that \noverwhelmingly benefits a certain ethnic group.  Thus, the \nequal  protection  claim  does  not  implicate  the  concerns \nmotivating  the  Court  in  AADC  and  underscored  by  the \ngovernment:  inhibiting  prosecutorial  discretion,  allowing \ncontinuing violations of immigration law, and impacting \nforeign relations.  The two cases cited by the government do \nnot  support  its  position,  as  both  of  them  involved  an \nindividual noncitizen making an equal protection argument \nin an attempt to avoid his own deportation.  See Kandamar \nv. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 65, 72–74 (1st Cir. 2006); Hadayat v. \nGonzales, 458 F.3d 659, 665 (7th Cir. 2006).  Plaintiffs’ \nchallenge  to  the  rescission  of  DACA—which  is  itself \ndiscretionary—is not such a case. \nThe government also contends that even if not totally \nbarred by AADC, plaintiffs’ claims must be subject to the \nheightened  pleading  standard  applied  to  selective-\nprosecution claims in the criminal context.  See United States \nv.  Armstrong,  517  U.S.  456,  463–65  (1996).

Ct. 2392 (2018), does not foreclose this \nclaim.    There,  statements  by  the  President  allegedly \nrevealing religious animus against Muslims were “[a]t the \nheart of plaintiffs’ case . . . .”  Hawaii, 138 S.

The \nextraordinary  practical  impact  of  allowing  DACA’s \nrescission to take effect before a final adjudication of its \nlegality  far  outweighs  the  minimal  practical  impact  of \nkeeping the program in place a bit longer.  For that reason, it \nis better now to risk incorrectly preserving the status quo \nthan to risk incorrectly disrupting it.1  However, I disagree \nwith  the portion of the majority’s opinion that we may \nreview the rescission of DACA for compliance with the \nAPA.2 \nUnder 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), “agency action [that] is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law” is not subject to \njudicial review for compliance with the APA.

In its petition for \ncertiorari before judgment, the government asserted that “a primary \npurpose of the Acting Secretary’s orderly wind-down of the DACA \npolicy was to avoid the disruptive effects on all parties of abrupt shifts \nin the enforcement of the Nation’s immigration laws.  Inviting more \nchanges before final resolution of this litigation would not further that \ninterest.” \n2 As for the government’s appeal from the motions to dismiss, I \ndissent, for reasons stated here, from the majority’s holding to affirm the \ndistrict court’s denial of the motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ APA arbitrary-\nand-capricious claim (Part VI-A).  However, I concur in the majority’s \nholding to affirm the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ APA notice-\nand-comment claim (Part VI-B).  I also concur in the judgment to affirm \nthe district court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ Due Process claims (Part VI-C; \nPart VI-D).  And, as explained here as well, I agree with the majority’s \ndecision to affirm the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss the \nEqual Protection claim (Part VI-E) and hold that the Equal Protection \nclaim offers an alternative ground to affirm the preliminary injunction. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 29 2o fo 9f 999\n92  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

USDHS  93 \n \nHere,  rather  than  authorize  judicial  review,  the  broad, \ndiscretion-granting  language  of  the  enabling  statute \nreinforces that DHS’s enforcement decision is not subject to \nAPA review.  See 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (“The Secretary shall be \nresponsible  for  . . .  [e]stablishing  national  immigration \nenforcement  policies  and  priorities.”);  see  also  Webster, \n486 U.S. at 599–600. \nPerhaps  recognizing  that  immigration  enforcement \ndecisions exhibit the characteristics of unreviewable agency \nactions, the majority decides that we should nonetheless \nreview the rescission of DACA because these features are \nnot actually at work here: Acting Secretary Duke explained \nthat DACA was rescinded based on DHS’s belief that the \nprogram was unlawful.  The majority points to Heckler’s \nfootnote 4, where the Court left open the question whether \ncourts may review agency action if “a refusal by the agency \nto institute proceedings [is] based solely on the belief that it \nlacks jurisdiction.”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4 (“[W]e \nexpress no opinion on whether such decisions would be \nunreviewable  under  § 701(a)(2)  . . . .”).    The  majority \nconcludes that the Supreme Court has not yet answered this \nquestion, and that our court, in Montana Air Chapter No. 29 \nv.  FLRA,  898  F.2d  753,  756–57  (9th  Cir.  1990),  has \nanswered it in the affirmative: that otherwise unreviewable \nagency action is reviewable when the agency justifies its \naction by reference to its understanding of its jurisdiction.  I \nrespectfully disagree. \nIn Montana Air, we confronted the question left open in \nHeckler’s footnote 4.  Specifically, we held that a decision \nby the Federal Labor Relations Authority’s General Counsel \nnot  to  issue  an  unfair  labor  practice  complaint  was \nreviewable only because his decision was “based solely on \nhis  belief  that  he  lacks  jurisdiction  to  issue  such  a \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 49 4o fo 9f 999\n94  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

But what we held reviewable were \nthe  General  Counsel’s  “statutory  and  regulatory \ninterpretations  to  determine  if  his  belief  that  he  lacked \njurisdiction was correct.”  Id. at 757.  Applying Chevron, we \nfound “impermissible” the General Counsel’s interpretations \nof the statute under which he acted.  Id. at 758. \nHere, by contrast, Plaintiffs do not ask that we apply \nChevron  to  review  whether  Acting  Secretary  Duke \nimpermissibly interpreted 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) in concluding \nthat the statute authorized the rescission of DACA.3  Instead, \nPlaintiffs  ask  that  we  review  for  arbitrariness  and \ncapriciousness the procedures the agency used to rescind \nDACA.  But nothing in Montana Air suggests that Heckler’s \nfootnote 4 authorizes arbitrary-and-capricious, rather than \nChevron, review of agency action simply because the agency \nacted based on its understanding of its enabling statute.  And, \ndespite Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary, BLE plainly \nprohibits us from doing so. \nIn BLE, the Supreme Court held that an agency’s refusal \nto reconsider a prior adjudicative decision was unreviewable \neven where the agency based its refusal on its interpretation \nof its enabling statute.  482 U.S. at 278–84.  In so holding, \nthe Court explained that the agency’s refusal to reconsider \nwas unreviewable because it was the type of action that “has \ntraditionally been ‘committed to agency discretion,’” id. at \n282 (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 832); thus any inquiry into \nits reasons for acting was inappropriate, id. at 280–81.  “It is \n                                                                                                 \n3 This is not surprising: § 202(5) makes the Secretary “responsible \nfor . . . [e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies and \npriorities.”  If we accept that this broad, discretion-granting statute \nauthorized DACA’s implementation, it surely also sanctions DACA’s \ntermination. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 59 5o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

BLE thus makes clear \nthat  when  determining  the  scope  of  permissible  judicial \nreview, courts consider only the type of agency action at \nissue, not the agency’s reasons for acting. \nFinally,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  even  if  BLE  precludes \nreview of some types of agency action regardless of the \nagency’s reason for acting, that rule only applies to single-\nshot enforcement decisions, not to general statements of \npolicy.  See NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 227–36 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (discussing Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. \nv. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and permitting \nAPA review on this ground).  In other words, Plaintiffs \nwould have us hold that general statements of policy—but \nnot single-shot enforcement decisions—are subject to APA \nreview  when  the  agency’s  sole  reason  for  acting  is  its \nunderstanding  of  its  jurisdiction.    While  the  majority \nacknowledges  Plaintiffs’  argument  without  reaching  its \nmerits, I believe that such a distinction collapses Heckler on \nits head: In deciding whether agency action is reviewable, \nthe first question we ask is what type of agency action is \nbefore us—whether it is agency action that courts typically \nreview or agency action “traditionally . . . ‘committed to \nagency discretion.’”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 832.  This initial \ninquiry includes consideration of whether the action is a \nsingle-shot non-enforcement decision or a general statement \nof  policy.    It  would  beg  the  question  to  conclude  that \nunreviewable agency action is in fact reviewable because it \nis the type of action that courts typically review. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 69 6o fo 9f 999\n96  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

USDHS \n \nI would therefore hold that § 701(a)(2) precludes us from \nsubjecting DACA’s rescission to arbitrary-and-capricious \nreview. \nAt the same time, as the government concedes, DACA’s \nrescission  may  be  reviewed  for  compliance  with  the \nConstitution.  I would hold that Plaintiffs have plausibly \nalleged  that  the  rescission  of  DACA  was  motivated  by \nunconstitutional  racial  animus  in  violation  of  the  Equal \nProtection component of the Fifth Amendment, and that the \ndistrict court correctly denied the government’s motion to \ndismiss this claim. \nNotably, Plaintiffs did not seek a preliminary injunction \non their Equal Protection claim, instead relying solely on \ntheir APA argument.  Nonetheless, this court may affirm a \npreliminary injunction on any basis supported by the record. \nValle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1021 (9th Cir. \n2013).  And because a preliminary injunction preserves the \ncourt’s power to render a meaningful decision on the merits, \nwe can affirm an injunction issued on legally erroneous \ngrounds  where  remand  for  consideration  of  alternative \ngrounds  is  warranted.    See  Gerling  Global  Reinsurance \nCorp. of Am. v. Low, 240 F.3d 739, 754 (9th Cir. 2001) (“It \nis possible that [the challenged law] violates the Due Process \nClause, but the district court did not reach that issue, and it \nis not fully developed in the record or in the briefs presented \nto this court.  We leave the preliminary injunction in place \nin order to give the district court an opportunity to consider \nwhether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.”); see \nalso United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1157 (9th \nCir. 2004) (en banc) (holding that the district court erred in \nentering an injunction but leaving “the injunction in place \n. . . pending the conclusion of all proceedings in this case, in \naid of the court’s jurisdiction”).

USDHS  97 \n \nthe  preliminary  injunction  and  remand  for  consideration \nwhether Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success \non the merits of their Equal Protection claim. \nAs the majority details, the record assembled at this early \nstage  is  promising.    Plaintiffs  highlight  (1)  the \ndisproportionate  impact  DACA’s  rescission  has  on \n“individuals of Mexican heritage, and Latinos, who together \naccount for 93 percent of approved DACA applications”; \n(2) a litany of statements by the President and high-ranking \nmembers  of  his  Administration  that  plausibly  indicate \nanimus  toward  undocumented  immigrants  from  Central \nAmerica;4 and (3) substantial procedural irregularities in the \nchallenged agency action. \nSuch  evidence—plus  whatever  additional  evidence \nPlaintiffs muster on remand—may well raise a presumption \nthat unconstitutional animus was a substantial factor in the \nrescission of DACA.  See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. \nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266–68 (1977); see also \nHawaii,  138  S.  Ct.  at  2420  (holding  that  courts  “may \nconsider plaintiffs’ extrinsic evidence” as permitted by the \napplicable level of scrutiny).  If the government fails to rebut \nthat  presumption,  Plaintiffs  will  have  demonstrated  a \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  See Arlington Heights, \n429 U.S. at 270 & n.21 (noting that proof that an action was \nmotivated  by  a  discriminatory  purpose  shifts  to  the \ngovernment the burden of establishing that the same decision \nwould have resulted without the impermissible purpose); \n                                                                                                 \n4 Like the majority, I do not interpret Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. \n2392 (2018), to preclude review of the President’s statements when \napplying the Arlington Heights standard.  At the merits stage, the district \ncourt  can  still  decide  whether,  or  to  what  degree,  the  President’s \nstatements betray a discriminatory animus behind DACA’s rescission. \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 89 8o fo 9f 999\n98  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

O  Centro  Espirita  Beneficente  Uniao  do \nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006) (affirming the injunction \nwhere  the  government  failed  to  meet  its  burden  at \npreliminary injunction stage, because “the burdens at the \npreliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial”).  As \nsuch, I believe that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged an Equal \nProtection violation and that the district court should decide \nwhether it is an alternative ground to grant the preliminary \ninjunction. \nMoreover, the balance of equities here weighs heavily in \nfavor of affirming the preliminary injunction.  A merits \ndecision from the district court concluding that the Executive \nrescinded DACA because of unconstitutional racial animus \nwould be little more than an advisory opinion if by that time \nthousands of young people had lost their status due to the \nlack of an injunction preserving it.  Preliminary injunctive \nrelief exists precisely for circumstances like these: “The \npurpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the \nrelative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can \nbe held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 \n(1981).  Thus, on these facts, the district court was correct to \nissue  a  preliminary  injunction.    See  Ashcroft  v.  ACLU, \n542 U.S. 656, 670 (2004) (affirming injunction where “the \npotential  harms  from  reversing  the  injunction  outweigh \nthose of leaving it in place by mistake”); Doran v.

NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 26 (2008) (reversing \ninjunction without addressing likelihood of success on the \nmerits where “the balance of equities and consideration of \nthe overall public interest in this case tip strongly in favor of \n[defendants]”). \n\n  CCaassee:  31:81-71-5c0v6-085, 31219/0-W8/H20A1  8 D, IoDc:u 1m1e0n8t1 9338 6  ,F DilektdE 1n1tr/y0:8 1/1989 - 1 P, aPgaeg e9 99 9o fo 9f 999\n  REGENTS OF THE UNIV.

INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  For the last five years, young people who have lived in the United States since \n3  they were children, even though they were born in another country, have had the right to live, \n4  work and attend college if they met stringent requirements as set forth by the Deferred Action \n5  for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”).  Exhibit 1.  The success of these DREAMers, as they are \n6  known, has been an incredible story.  Young people who otherwise would not have had the \n7  opportunity to attend college or work have now had that ability, thus enriching the lives of \n8  themselves, their families, and their communities.  Under DACA, Plaintiff, the City of San Jose \n9  (“San Jose”), and other California cities have been able to hire DREAMers, which has \n10  benefited the cities and their residents.   \n11  2.  DACA has protected from deportation, and extended work authorization to more \n12  than 800,000 young people who were brought to this country as children.  DACA affords \n13  recipients a two-year period of “deferred action” status, meaning they are not subject to \n14  immigration enforcement actions during that time, and work authorization, allowing them to \n15  work legally, report income, and pay taxes. \n16  3.  During the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric about immigration became nasty.  \n17  One of the candidates who made extremely outrageous and false statements about immigrants \n18  was defendant Donald J. Trump.  After he was elected and sworn into office, President \n19  Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric continued.   \n20  4.  Yet, throughout the early days of the campaign and President Trump’s \n21  presidency, he made positive and reassuring comments about DACA and the DREAMers.  On \n22  April 24, 2017 in an interview with the Associated Press, for example, President Trump told \n23  undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children that they could \n24  “rest easy.” \n25  AP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don't want \n26  to give them the wrong message with this. \n27  TRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give \n28  you that. The dreamers should rest easy.... \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    1 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 5 of 24\n \n1  5.  Since the United States is a land of immigrants, most Americans realize the \n2  importance of immigrants to this country. \n3  6.  President Trump broke his promises.  He directed his Attorney General to make \n4  an announcement on September 5, 2017, that DACA would be rescinded, Exhibit 2, and then \n5  Defendant Elaine C. Duke (“Secretary Duke”) as the Acting Secretary of the Department of \n6  Homeland Security, issued a memorandum that rescinded DACA, although it deferred rescission \n7  for six months.  (“Duke Memorandum”).  Exhibit 3.   \n8  7.  Secretary Duke’s memorandum, did not explain the administration’s reasons for \n9  rescinding DACA.  Instead, the memorandum referred to the Attorney General’s assertion that \n10  DACA may be unlawful, based on a case involving different programs – Deferred Action for \n11  Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”).  The reasons for the \n12  rescission were contrary to the facts, and arbitrary and capricious. \n13  8.  This Court entered a preliminary injunction in January 2018, requiring DHS to \n14  continue processing renewal applications, a decision affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n15  the Ninth Circuit in November 2018.  Then, on June 18, 2020 the Supreme Court held that the \n16  Duke Memorandum rescinding DACA was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious under the \n17  Administrative Procedure Act, and must be set aside.   \n18  9.  In spite of the Supreme Court’s decision, Defendants have continued their \n19  attempts to dismantle the DACA program.  On July 28, 2020, Defendant Chad Wolf, in his \n20  capacity as purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, issued a memorandum (the “Wolf \n21  Memorandum”), Exhibit 4, directing DHS to make immediate changes to DACA.  The Wolf \n22  Memorandum orders DHS to reject all new DACA applications, to reject all requests for \n23  advance parole (i.e., permission to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad) other than in \n24  exceptional circumstance.  The Wolf Memorandum also reduces the renewal period for current \n25  DACA recipients from two years to one.  On August 21, 2020, Defendant Edlow, in his \n26  purported capacity as Deputy Director of Policy of Defendant United States Citizenship and \n27  Immigration Services (“USCIS”), issued a memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum \n28  (the “Edlow Directive”). \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    2 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 6 of 24\n \n1  10.  Defendants’ actions are invalid, unlawful and must be set aside.   \n2  11.  As an initial matter, Defendant Wolf lacked the authority to direct changes to the \n3  DACA program because at the time he issued the Wolf Memorandum, he was unlawfully \n4  exercising the functions of the Secretary of Homeland Security, in violation of the United States \n5  Constitution, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3341 et seq., and \n6  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. § 111 et seq. (“HSA”).   \n7  12.  Moreover, the Wolf Memorandum, the Duke Memorandum, and the Edlow \n8  Directive were all arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and violate the Due Process Clause \n9  of the Fifth Amendment.  For these reasons, Plaintiff asks this Court to declare the Wolf \n10  Memorandum and Edlow Directive unlawful and unenforceable, and to enjoin and restrain \n11  Defendants from taking further steps to rescind the program pursuant to those unlawful actions.   \n12  13.  Over a quarter of DACA recipients live in California.  The program has \n13  benefitted DACA recipients, their families, their employers, local communities, and American \n14  society as a whole.   \n15  14.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, DACA recipients and these stakeholders have \n16  been harmed.  Fear and uncertainty have invaded their lives.  Not only have they been injured, \n17  but so too has San Jose.   \n18  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19  15.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. This Court has \n20  further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 et \n21  seq.  This Court also has additional remedial authority under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06.  \n22  16.  Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because Plaintiff, \n23  the City of San Jose, is a public entity in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events \n24  or omissions giving rise to this action will occur or have occurred in this District. 28 U.S.C. § \n25  1391(e). \n26  17.  There exists an actual and justiciable controversy between Plaintiff and \n27  Defendants requiring resolution by this Court.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n28  / / / \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    3 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 7 of 24\n \n1  III.  PARTIES \n2  A.  Plaintiff \n3  18.  Plaintiff San Jose is a municipal corporation, organized as a Charter City under \n4  the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California and is located in the County of \n5  Santa Clara.  It is the tenth largest city in the United States.  San Jose has always been a place \n6  for immigrants with almost 40% of its current population having been born in another country.  \n7  San Jose, which had been home to the Ohlone Indians for hundreds of years, was founded by \n8  Spain on November 29, 1777, as El Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe.  In 1821, San Jose \n9  became part of Mexico.  After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded California to the United \n10  States at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, San Jose became its first incorporated \n11  U.S. city.   \n12  19.  San Jose is bringing this action on its own behalf and on the behalf of its \n13  employees who are DACA recipients.  As described below, San Jose has suffered its own injury \n14  in fact.  It also has third party standing to bring this action on behalf of its employees because \n15  San Jose has a concrete interest in the outcome of the dispute; San Jose has a close relationship \n16  with its employees, whose rights it is asserting, and there is a hindrance to the employees to \n17  protect their own interests.  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-11, (1991); Singleton v. Wulff, \n18  428 U.S. 106, 113-16 (1976); Wedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, \n19  62 (9th Cir. 1994).  Where here, San Jose is asserting the same right, to allow DACA recipient \n20  employees to have the right to legally work for San Jose, San Jose’s and its employees rights are \n21  inextricably bound up, which satisfies the requirement that San Jose’s interest is sufficiently \n22  aligned with that of its employees.  Viceroy Gold Corp. v. Aubry, 75 F.3d 482, 488-89 (9th Cir. \n23  1996).  The fact that the employees are undocumented immigrants with fear of provoking the \n24  attention of the immigration authorities or creating other legal risks satisfies the requirement that \n25  there is a hindrance to San Jose’s employees protecting their own interests, especially in light of \n26  Defendants’ demonstrated hostility to them.  Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 \n27  F.3d 1027, 1044 (11th Cir. 2008). \n28  / / / \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    4 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 8 of 24\n \n1  B.  Defendants \n2  20.  Defendant Donald J. Trump has been the President of the United States since \n3  January 20, 2017.  He is sued in his official capacity.  As a candidate, he railed against \n4  immigrants.  When he announced his candidacy in June 2015, for example, he stated: “The U.S. \n5  has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.  Thank you.  It’s true, and these \n6  are the best and the finest.  When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.  \n7  They’re not sending you.  They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of \n8  problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us.  They’re bringing drugs.  They’re bringing \n9  crime.  They’re rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.”  There was no factual support \n10  for this statement.  Despite his animus towards immigrants, he has consistently indicated his \n11  support for DACA, including tweeting on September 7, 2017, after DACA was rescinded, that \n12  “For all those (DACA) that are concerned about status during the 6 month period, you have \n13  nothing to worry about – No action!”  \n14  21.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is the purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  \n15  He is purportedly responsible for managing and overseeing DHS, including the United States \n16  Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) and the Immigration and Customs \n17  Enforcement (“ICE”).  Plaintiff sues him in his official capacity.   \n18  22.   Defendant DHS is a federal agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1), \n19  and Defendant USCIS is a component of DHS responsible for implementing the immigration \n20  laws and policies of the United States, including the DACA program.   \n21  23.  Defendant Joseph Edlow is the purported Deputy Director of Policy of USCIS.  \n22  He is sued in his official capacity, in which capacity he issued the challenged Edlow Directive. \n23  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n24  22.  The Statue of Liberty has stood as a welcoming beacon of hope and inspiration to \n25  the millions of immigrants who have come to the United States through New York.  Inscribed on \n26  the statue are the stirring words of Emma Lazarus to: “Give me your tired, your poor, your \n27  huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”   \n28  / / / \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    5 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 9 of 24\n \n1  23.  Contrasting this inspiring message, some groups in the United States have \n2  historically tried to limit citizenship to groups of people some found undesirable. Yet, most of \n3  the immigrants who have come to the United States simply want to better their lives, support \n4  their families, and contribute productively to their new country. Diversity of citizenship \n5  achieved through immigration has helped America become the international powerhouse it is \n6  today. \n7  A.  The DACA Program \n8  24.  Throughout the latter part of the last century and the first part of this century, \n9  politicians could not agree on a comprehensive immigration policy.  Immigrants who would \n10  have had a clear path to citizenship in the past found citizenship almost impossible to achieve.  \n11  Yet, immigrants who had no hope in their country of birth came to the United States without \n12  documentation for a better life.  In the process, they have enriched our country.  Many of these \n13  immigrants brought their entire families, including their young children. \n14  25.  By 2012, there were millions of residents who came here as children, but they did \n15  not have documentation to remain in this country.  As Congress stalled in enacting any \n16  meaningful immigration reform, there was a groundswell to protect these young people from \n17  deportation and allow them to live productive lives to enrich themselves, their families and their \n18  adopted country. \n19  26.  In June of 2012, President Barack Obama, through an Executive Order, enacted \n20  DACA.  He stated that he believed it was “the right thing to do” to protect young people who do \n21  not know any country but America.  On June 15, 2012, then Secretary of Homeland Security \n22  Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program.  Exhibit 1.  DACA is \n23  in essence a deferred prosecution agreement. \n24  27.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established that an applicant would be \n25  considered for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion only by satisfying each of the following \n26  criteria: \n27  •  came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n28  •  had continuously resided in the United States for at least five years \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    6 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 10 of 24\n \n1  preceding the date of the memorandum and is present in the United States \n2  on the date of the memorandum; \n3  •  was currently in school, had graduated from high school, had obtained a \n4  general education development certificate, or was an honorably \n5  discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United \n6  States; \n7  •  had not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor \n8  offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to \n9  national security or public safety; and \n10  •  was not above the age of thirty. \n11  28.  In addition to simply being eligible for this program, undocumented immigrants \n12  must also pay a $495 application fee, submit several forms, and produce documents showing \n13  they meet the requirements.  Moreover, if a DACA qualifying immigrant wants to travel abroad \n14  there is an additional fee and application requirement required.  Those applying are also vetted \n15  for any criminal history or threat to national security and must be students or have completed \n16  school or military service.  If approved, action to deport them is deferred for two years, along \n17  with the opportunity to renew, along with gaining eligibility for basics like a driving license, \n18  college enrollment or a work permit. \n19  29.  In exchange for DACA applicants providing sensitive and private information \n20  regarding their entire lives, the United States government promised to keep the information \n21  confidential and not to use it, except in limited circumstances, for any purposes except for \n22  DACA purposes.   \n23  B.  Immigrants Contribute to the Success of the United States and California \n24  Cities \n25  30.  San Jose has been an extremely diverse region since the mid-1800s, which has \n26  led to immigrants gravitating to such areas where there are already established immigrant \n27  communities.  Waves of immigrants, from China and Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Northern \n28  Europe, have played a fundamental role in the creation of three profoundly different industries: \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    7 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 11 of 24\n \n1  first mining, then agriculture, and finally technology in San Jose and the Silicon Valley.  \n2  http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19862.   \n3  31.  Each California city has its own story of immigration from Spain, Mexico, China, \n4  Russia, and other countries, which has led to California being a successful and vibrant part of \n5  our country.   \n6  32.  And the United States has been positively impacted by immigrants, even \n7  undocumented immigrants, as reflected in multiple studies.  In April of 2016 for example, the \n8  U.S. Chamber of Commerce published a report entitled Immigration Myths and Faces, \n9  www.uschamber.com/reports/immigration-myths.  The report demonstrates that most common \n10  negative contentions regarding immigrants are false.  For example, with citation to evidence, the \n11  Chamber of Commerce demonstrates that immigrants do not take away jobs from U.S. citizens, \n12  do not drive down the wages of the U.S. workers, but to the contrary, immigrants are necessary \n13  for the U.S. economy.  The Chamber also demonstrates that immigrants, even undocumented \n14  immigrants, pay taxes.  Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefit \n15  programs like Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and food stamps.  The Chamber report \n16  demonstrates that undocumented immigrants do not commit more crime than citizens.  FBI data \n17  demonstrates that as the number of undocumented immigrants tripled from 1990, violent crime \n18  declined 48% and property crime declined 41%.  A report from the conservative Americas \n19  Majority Foundation found that crime rates are lowest in states with the highest immigration \n20  growth rates.  Immigrants are less likely than people born in the United States to commit crimes \n21  or be incarcerated.   \n22  C.  DACA Has Provided 800,000 Young People Who Have Known No Other \n23  Country than the United States a Chance to Attend College and/or Work \n24  33.  The rewards of DACA have been enormous, not only to the immigrants who \n25  came to this country as children, but to the nation.  First-generation immigrants who enter the \n26  United States as children tend to pay, on average, more in taxes over their lifetimes than they \n27  receive in benefits, regardless of their education level.  DACA recipients end up contributing \n28  more than the average, because they are not eligible for any federal means-tested welfare: cash \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    8 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 12 of 24\n \n1  assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, health-care tax credits or anything else.   \n2  34.  Moreover, DACA recipients also are better educated than the average immigrant. \n3  Applicants must have at least a high school degree to enter the program.  An additional 36 \n4  percent of DACA recipients who are older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree, and an additional \n5  32 percent are pursuing a bachelor’s degree. \n6  35.  Further, while studies show that undocumented immigrants are much less likely \n7  to end up in prison, this fact is especially true for DACA recipients since applicants must also \n8  pass a background check, indicating even lower levels of criminal behavior than the average \n9  American citizen.   \n10  36.  DACA has been a success as it has allowed over 800,000 recipients to work and \n11  go to college in the United States thus enriching our economy and security.   \n12  D.  San Jose and Silicon Valley Have Benefitted From DACA \n13  37.  For San Jose, the ability to hire DACA recipients has been extremely beneficial.  \n14  San Jose, like the rest of the Silicon Valley, has the need for a skilled work force.  Competition \n15  for employees in San Jose and Santa Clara County is fierce.  When DACA was enacted, San \n16  Jose was able to hire DACA grantees.  San Jose spent time and resources training these \n17  employees and they hold jobs vital to the operation of San Jose to this day. \n18  38.  The City is one of the largest employers in the region, employing workers in a \n19  wide variety of positions for the betterment of their community. One of the main ways in which \n20  the City has benefited from the DACA program is through its employment relationships with \n21  DACA recipients.  In particular, the City currently employs DACA recipients as full-time \n22  employees, and has expended significant resources, both time and money, in training these \n23  employees and relies upon them to provide City services.  Because DACA recipients are under \n24  no obligation to identify themselves as such when they apply for a job, and they present the \n25  same form of work authorization card as other categories of immigrants, the City cannot \n26  determine with certainty the total number of DACA recipients it employs. \n27  39.  San Jose is also home to tech companies, like Cisco and Adobe, who need skilled \n28  workers.  These companies also hired DACA recipients as did other Silicon Valley companies, \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    9 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 13 of 24\n \n1  like Apple, Facebook, and Google, and many employees live in San Jose.   \n2  40.  DACA recipients have special skills that make them especially valuable \n3  employees of the City.  For example, over ninety-five percent of DACA recipients are bilingual, \n4  and extraordinarily valuable skill to the City, which must employ a workforce that can meet its \n5  diverse residents’ language needs.  This is a critical aspect of ensuring meaningful access to City \n6  services, programs, and benefits.  Given San Jose’s incredible diversity, bilingual employees are \n7  an enormously valuable asset and San Jose would be greatly harmed to lose it.  City employment \n8  is contingent on valid, lawful work authorization.  Any restraints on the DACA program and \n9  DACA recipients undoubtedly harm the City.  \n10  E.  The Latest Attempts to Diminish the DACA Program \n11  41.  Less than six weeks after the Supreme Court’s vacatur of the Duke \n12  Memorandum, DHS issued the Wolf Memorandum, announcing it was “considering anew the \n13  DACA policy.”  Id. at 4.  The Memorandum explains that “the DACA policy, at a minimum, \n14  presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,” offering several policy \n15  “concerns.”  Id.  Those concerns do not constitute a valid, reasoned basis for the changes to \n16  DACA outlined in the Wolf Memorandum. \n17  42.  First, the Memorandum’s assertion that “rescinding DACA entirely may well \n18  create a more pressing need for Congress” to enact immigration reforms—i.e., creating political \n19  pressure on the legislature—is not a valid basis on which to put hundreds of thousands of DACA \n20  recipients at risk.  Id.   \n21  43.  The Wolf Memorandum then expresses general concerns about general policies \n22  of “non-enforcement.”  Id. at 5.  His concerns, however, are not supported by any evidence that \n23  such policies—policies that have been used by DHS for decades—negatively impact effective \n24  immigration enforcement. \n25  44.  Third, the Wolf Memorandum raises a concern that DACA might encourage \n26  “illegal immigration,” especially “illegal immigrations involving children going forward.”    \n27  may be sending mixed signals about the agency’s “intention to consistently enforce the \n28  immigration laws as Congress has written them.”  Id.  Again, however, Defendant Wolf \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    10 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 14 of 24\n \n1  provides no empirical evidence supporting the idea that DACA has increased rates of illegal \n2  immigration.   \n3  F.  Defendant Wolf is acting unlawfully as Acting Secretary of Homeland \n4  Security \n5  45.  At the time he issued the Wolf Memorandum, Defendant Wolf was unlawfully \n6  serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  He was not authorized to exercise the duties \n7  of the office of Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to the United States Constitution, the \n8  Homeland Security Act, and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.  As such, he lacked authority to \n9  issue to Wolf Memorandum, and the Wolf Memorandum is therefore without force or effect.   \n10  46.  The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that the President “shall \n11  nominate, and by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Officers, of the \n12  United States.”  U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  There has been no Senate-confirmed Secretary of \n13  Homeland Security since April 10, 2019, when former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned.  The \n14  position was held by CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan (without Senate confirmation) until \n15  November 13, 2019, when he resigned.  Thereafter, Defendant Wolf purported to take office as \n16  Acting Secretary of Homeland Secretary.   \n17  47.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., lays out \n18  how agencies are to be governed while awaiting nomination and confirmation of agency-heads.  \n19  Defendants failed to follow the FVRA. \n20  48.  Under the FVRA, the “first assistant to the officer” of a vacant office becomes \n21  the acting official by default, 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1).  However, the President may also direct a \n22  person to fill a vacancy in an acting capacity for no more than 210 days from the date of the \n23  vacancy.  5 U.S.C.  § 3345(a)(2), 3346.  After that period, “the office shall remain vacant” \n24  except in certain limited circumstances not applicable here). 5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).    \n25  49.  The Homeland Security Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., further details the \n26  line of succession that should be followed when the Secretary of Homeland Security position is \n27  vacated.  Under 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A), the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security is the \n28  “first assistant” for purposes of the FVRA.  The Under Secretary for Management of the DHS is \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    11 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 15 of 24\n \n1  next in line.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1). \n2  50.  Defendants violated the Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and the HSA.   \n3  51.  In February 2019, Secretary Nielsen issued an order of succession—HSA \n4  Delegation 00106, Revision No. 08.4 (“Nielsen Delegation”).  Neither Commissioner \n5  McAleenan, nor Defendant Wolf, fall within the proper order of succession under the Nielsen \n6  Delegation.   \n7  52.  Commissioner McAleenan’s subsequent attempts to amend the Nielsen \n8  Delegation were unlawful and invalid, because he lacked authority to amend the Delegation. \n9  53.  Under the Nielsen Delegation, and the HSA, the Director of Cybersecurity and \n10  Infrastructure Security Agency, Christopher Krebs (who had been confirmed by the Senate), \n11  should have been designated as the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security upon Commissioner \n12  McAleenan’s resignation. \n13  54.  Finally, under the FVRA, as of November 7, 2019, the office of Secretary had \n14  remained without a Senate-confirmed nominee for more than 210 days, requiring the office to \n15  “remain vacant.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).   \n16  55.  Defendant Wolf’s actions as purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security—\n17  including issuance of the Wolf Memorandum, are without force and effect.  5 U.S.C. § \n18  3348(d)(1), (2). \n19  G.  San Jose Has Taken Action to Try to Help Its Immigrant Residents, But Has \n20  Limited Ability to Effectuate Change, Except With this Lawsuit \n21  56.  San Jose’s support of immigrants has been consistent throughout the events \n22  giving rise to this case. For example, in response to President Trump’s widespread anti-\n23  immigrant rhetoric, in January of 2017, the City Council, approved a plan proposed by Mayor \n24  Sam Liccardo to educate immigrants about their rights, helping schools with “safety plans,” and \n25  allowing churches to provide sanctuary to undocumented residents if needed.  The plan also \n26  created “safe spaces” in city-owned facilities, such as libraries, to provide pro-bono legal \n27  services.   \n28  / / / \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    12 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 16 of 24\n \n1  57.  In response to the Defendants’ rescission of DACA, San Jose confirmed its \n2  support of its immigrant residents and DACA recipients specifically.  Mayor Sam Liccardo, for \n3  example, issued the following statement: \n \nThe Attorney Generals announcement of the Trump Administration's rescission \n4 \nof DACA abandons 800,000 of America's hardest-working, most patriotic residents. \nPunting the issue to Congress, without any affirmative leadership to enact a legislative \n5 \nsolution, amounts to a cowardly cop-out, placing the futures of these young women and \nmen in serious jeopardy. \n6 \n \nTo San Jose's tens of thousands of DREAMers, we reiterate: “We've got your \n7 \nback.” I will seek to challenge the Administration's actions in court, after consulting with \nour Council and City Attorney regarding our options in the week ahead. \n8 \n \n9  History will not forgive Donald Trump for abandoning our DREAMers. \n10  58.  Santa Clara County Board of Supervisor’s Chair Dave Cortese stated: “Trump’s \n11  plan to eliminate DACA is by far his most callous attempt as of yet. The lives, dreams, and \n12  futures of thousands of DACA recipients are not a bargaining chip for this Administration to \n13  play with. I remain committed to them and to their cause.  I urge every DREAMer out there to \n14  remain resilient and hopeful.  Because together, we will rise.”   \n15  H.  The Federal Government’s Changes to the DACA Program Will Harm San \n16  Jose  \n17  59.  The Wolf Memorandum (and the Edlow Directive purportedly implementing it) \n18  orders DHS to reject all new initial DACA applications, to reject all advance parole applications \n19  absent exceptional circumstances, and to reduce the renewal period for current DACA recipients \n20  from two years to one year, applying these changes retroactively to all applications submitted \n21  after the Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 decision.   \n22  60.  These directives already have had and will continue to have an impact, not only \n23  on the lives of the DACA recipients, but on San Jose, which has suffered a concrete and specific \n24  injury by the changes contemplated by the Wolf and Edlow changes to the program.   \n25  61.  In order for an employer to hire an employee, the employer must confirm that the \n26  employee has the legal right to work in the United States.  See 8 C.F.R. § 274A.1 et seq.  Cities \n27  who employ people without the right to work face steep penalties and criminal penalties.  \n28  However, it is also illegal for the cities to terminate employees because of their nationality or \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    13 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 17 of 24\n \n1  immigration status.  Thus San Jose is facing the uncertainty of not knowing whether it will be \n2  able to continue to retain valuable DACA employees in its work force. \n3  62.  For example, an employee whose DACA status is up for renewal, must now \n4  contend with retroactive application of a law reducing their renewal period by half.  Those who \n5  are unable to renew their applications and do not have alternative methods for obtaining lawful \n6  immigration status, are subject to deportation.  This causes considerable uncertainty and \n7  instability to San Jose.  \n8  63.  It also causes San Jose harm in that the resources and time spent training and \n9  retaining current DACA recipient employees is in effect, wasted.  San Jose has expended and \n10  will continue to extend time and resources to react to such a loss of experienced employees. \n11  64.    And in order for San Jose to end the employment relationship with an employee \n12  and to make sure that there is a smooth transition without the loss of city services, San Jose must \n13  start planning now. San Jose must make preemptive plans to change their workforce in this \n14  manner. Defendants’ changes to the program will cost valuable city resources as San Jose \n15  scrambles to meet its personnel needs in light of Defendants’ changes, amongst budgeting and \n16  bureaucratic constraints unique to such public entities. \n17  65.  Moreover, prohibiting any new DACA applications divests the City of San Jose \n18  of a segment of the workforce it would otherwise be permitted to hire and retain.   \n19  66.  The acts of Defendants have decreased the efficiency of the work performed by \n20  San Jose.  The impact of Defendants’ changes to DACA recipients has been catastrophic as they \n21  face a future of uncertainty and fear.  San Jose has also had to expend time and resources to deal \n22  with the loss of productivity and employee morale because of the rescission of DACA, which is \n23  another injury.1  \n24  67.  Additionally, because of the taxes that DACA recipients pay, San Jose is facing \n25  the loss of tax revenues.  They have had to start expending time and resources to deal with this \n26  loss of funds. \n27   \n1 See e.g., FPL Food, LLC v. United States Dep't of Agric., 671 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1358 (S.D.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2  (All Claims Are Against All Defendants) \n3  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n5  68.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporate by reference all the allegations set forth in this \n6  Amended Complaint. \n7  69.  The Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive are subject to judicial review as \n8  final agency actions. \n9  70.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action “found \n10  to be arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n11  contrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory \n12  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; without observance of procedure \n13  required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n14  71.  The Wolf Memorandum is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, \n15  contrary to law, and in excess of statutory authority.  The Wolf Memorandum and Edlow \n16  Directive were issued by and pursuant to the directives of an Acting Secretary who had no \n17  authority to so act.   \n18  72.  Moreover, the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive fail to provide a \n19  reasoned basis for the actions of DHS, and fail to consider other important aspects and issues, \n20  including the reliance interests of the City of San Jose and its employees.   \n21  73.  The Wolf Memorandum and the Edlow Directive implementing it are arbitrary \n22  and capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory authority in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n23  § 706(2)(A) & (C), and must be held unlawful and set aside. \n24  74.  San Jose, its employees, and its residents have been harmed and continue to be \n25  harmed by these unlawful acts. \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    15 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 19 of 24\n \n1  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  Violation of Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.,  \n3  and Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. §§ 112–13 \n4  75.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all the allegations set forth in \n5  this Amended Complaint. \n6  76.  The Secretary of Homeland Security must be appointed by the President with the \n7  advice and consent of the Senate.  6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1). \n8  77.  When the office of the Secretary is vacant, only a valid Acting Secretary may \n9  perform the functions or duties of the Secretary. \n10  78.  Commissioner McAleenan lacked the authority to amend the order of succession \n11  which purported to make Defendant Wolf next in line for Acting Secretary for at least three \n12  independent reasons.   \n13  79.  First, Commissioner McAleenan improperly assumed the position of Acting \n14  Secretary in violation of the order of succession under the HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2), and so \n15  was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary.   \n16  80.  Second, section 113(g)(2) of the HSA authorizes only the Secretary, not an \n17  Acting Secretary, to establish a further order of succession to that office.2   \n18  81.  And third, by the time Commissioner McAleenan purported to amend the DHS \n19  order of succession, he had already been serving for longer than the FVRA’s limit of 210 days.  \n20  See 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a).  Because the office of the Secretary had been vacant for more than 210 \n21  days, the FVRA required that it “remain vacant” until the President submitted a nominee to the \n22  Senate.  Id. § 3348(b)(1).   \n23  82.  Thus, for these reasons, Commissioner McAleenan amended the order of \n24  succession without lawful authority, and his actions “have no force or effect,” 5 U.S.C. \n25  § 3348(d)(1).  Because Defendant Wolf assumed the position of Acting Secretary pursuant to \n26   \n2 See Nw. Immgr. Rts. Project v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., No. 19-cv-03283-RDM, slip \n27  op.  at  38–42,  52  (D.D.C.  October  8.  2020)  (Moss,  J.)  (“The  Court  therefore  concludes  that \n‘Secretary’ in § 113(g)(2) does not include an Acting Secretary, but instead means the Secretary \n28  and only the Secretary.”).   \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    16 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 20 of 24\n \n1  Commissioner McAleenan’s unlawful amendments, his service in that role is unlawful under \n2  both the HSA and FVRA. \n3  83.  Besides these defects in Commissioner McAleenan’s authority, by the time \n4  Defendant Wolf assumed the role of Acting Secretary on November 13, 2019, the office of the \n5  Secretary had been vacant for 217 days, a week past the total 210 days an office can by occupied \n6  by an acting official before it must remain vacant under the FVRA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a).  \n7  And by the time Defendant Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum on July 28, 2020, the office of \n8  the Secretary had been vacant for 475 days and Defendant Wolf had been serving as Acting \n9  Secretary for 258 days.  For these reasons as well, Defendant Wolf’s assumption of the office \n10  and issuance of the Wolf Memorandum were unlawful. \n11  84.  As a result of these separate and independent legal infirmities, Defendant Wolf \n12  was not lawfully serving in the office of Acting Secretary, no officer could perform the \n13  functions of Acting Secretary, and no officer had legal authority to issue a memorandum even \n14  temporarily rescinding or modifying key components of the DACA program. \n15  85.  Because the Wolf Memorandum was issued by an officer unlawfully serving as \n16  Acting Secretary, it “shall have no force and effect” and “may not be ratified.”  5 U.S.C. \n17  § 3348(d)(1), (d)(2).  Defendant Wolf’s First and Second Ratification Memoranda are therefore \n18  contrary to the plain terms of the FVRA and cannot remedy the legal defects of the Wolf \n19  Memorandum.  Even if the plain text of the FVRA did not bar ratification, Defendant Wolf \n20  could not have issued his Ratification Memoranda because, as already explained, the office of \n21  the Secretary has been vacant for far more than 210 days and must “remain vacant, 5 U.S.C. \n22  § 3346(a); the FVRA prohibits nominees from serving in an acting capacity the role for which \n23  they have been nominated, see id. § 3345(b)(1); and, in any event, the Gaynor Order did not and \n24  could not cure the defects in Wolf’s unlawful assumption of the role of Acting Secretary. \n25  86.  Because the Wolf Memorandum was issued by an unlawfully designated officer \n26  under the HSA and the FVRA, it must be held to have “no force or effect.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d). \n27  87.  San Jose, its employees, and its residents have been harmed and continue to be \n28  harmed by these unlawful acts. \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    17 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 21 of 24\n \n1  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  Violation of the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2 \n3  88.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set forth in this \n4  Amended Complaint. \n5  89.  At the time he issued the Wolf Memorandum, Defendant Wolf was unlawfully \n6  serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  He was not authorized to exercise the duties \n7  of the office of Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to the United States Constitution, the \n8  Homeland Security Act, and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.  As such, he lacked authority to \n9  issue to Wolf Memorandum, and the Wolf Memorandum is therefore without force or effect.   \n10  90.  Defendants violated the Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and the HSA.   \n11  91.  In February 2019, Secretary Nielsen issued an order of succession—HSA \n12  Delegation 00106, Revision No. 08.4 (“Nielsen Delegation”).  Neither Commissioner \n13  McAleenan, nor Defendant Wolf, fall within the proper order of succession under the Nielsen \n14  Delegation.   \n15  92.  Commissioner McAleenan’s subsequent attempts to amend the Nielsen \n16  Delegation were unlawful and invalid, because he lacked authority to amend the Delegation. \n17  93.  Under the Nielsen Delegation, and the HSA, the Director of Cybersecurity and \n18  Infrastructure Security Agency, Christopher Krebs (who had been confirmed by the Senate), \n19  should have been designated as the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security upon Commissioner \n20  McAleenan’s resignation. \n21  94.  Finally, under the FVRA, as of November 7, 2019, the office of Secretary had \n22  remained without a Senate-confirmed nominee for more than 210 days, requiring the office to \n23  “remain vacant.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).   \n24  95.  Defendant Wolf’s actions as purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security—\n25  including issuance of the Wolf Memorandum, are without force and effect.  5 U.S.C. § \n26  3348(d)(1), (2). \n27  96.  Defendant Wolf was not serving legally as the Acting Secretary of Homeland \n28  Security, and therefore did not have legal authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum or to appoint \nLaw Offices  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF;  \nCOTCHETT, PITRE &  Case No. 3:17-cv-05329-WHA    18 \nMCCARTHY, LLP \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05329-WHA   Document 103   Filed 11/02/20   Page 22 of 24\n \n1  Defendant Edlow to serve as Deputy Director for Policy of USCIS. \n2  97.  The Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive are invalid and must be vacated, \n3  because they were issued by officials without the authority to do so.   \n4  98.  San Jose, its employees, and its residents have been harmed and continue to be \n5  harmed by these unlawful acts. \n6  VI.
