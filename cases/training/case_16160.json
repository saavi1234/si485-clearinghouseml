    "summary": "<p>This suit, brought on September 18, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenged President Trump's revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The plaintiffs were DACA recipients who sought to enjoin the government from ending the program. Not only did the plaintiffs stand to lose benefits and security they have relied upon, but the plaintiffs argued that the communities in which they reside also stand to lose valuable contributing members. The complaint argued that the DACA program made promises to its recipients upon which they have relied for their entire lives in America. As a result, the plaintiffs contended that revoking DACA violated Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. They sought equitable estoppel, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, the Obama administration created the DACA program by DHS policy statements. The program offered work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. As of 2017, there were an estimated 800,000 DACA recipients. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he was ending the program in March unless Congress acted within the next six months. As the complaint highlighted, the Obama administration in promoting DACA made key promises to immigrants: that any information they provided in the application process would not be used for immigration enforcement, and that barring criminal activity or fraud in their DACA applications, DACA recipients would be able to renew their status and keep their benefits.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, represented by public and private counsel, were six individuals who were brought into the U.S. at young ages and lived, worked, and studied in California. One was a practicing attorney, one was a special education teacher, and four others attended graduate school. The plaintiffs argued that they each relied on the government's promises. They also argued that the revocation of DACA was fueled by President Trump's anti-Mexican racial animus evidenced in his past statements and actions. Moreover, the plaintiffs stated that the government took \"affirmative steps to reduce the protections applicable to information provided in connection with the DACA program\" as evidenced by a January 2017 Executive Order mandating that all agencies &ldquo;ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero. On Sept. 20, the case was marked as related to two other cases: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of California v. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>, No. 17-cv-05235, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>, No. 17-cv-05211. The next day, the case was reassigned to Judge William Alsup. On Oct. 16, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>County of Santa Clara v. Trump</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City of San Jose v. Trump</em></a>, were added as related cases. All are in the Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 6, 2017, in a related challenge led by Regents of University of California before this judge, the government filed the administrative record, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0051-0008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, which included a series of government documents pertaining to DACA from its inception to the decision to rescind it. On Oct. 17, after the University in the related case moved to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record, the court ordered them to do so in all related cases, including this one. The court found that the defendants did not produce all documents leading to the rescission, specifically related documents that Acting Secretary Duke did not directly review. The defendants moved to stay further proceedings at this court on Oct. 18 in light of their intent to appeal this ruling to the Ninth Circuit. The court denied staying proceedings on Oct. 19, and the defendants appealed the next day by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus to the district court and emergency motion for stay. On Oct. 23, 2017, the district court replied to the Ninth Circuit's invitation to answer the government's petition stating it would not stay proceedings in light of the narrow window of time until the DACA ends on March 5, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On Nov. 16, 2017, the Ninth Circuit denied defendants' motion for a writ of mandamus and vacated the stay of discovery and record expansion that had been entered, and the District Court immediately ordered the federal government to file an augmented administrative record by Nov 22, 2017. On Nov. 17, 2017, the federal government filed an emergency motion noting that it intended to file an application for mandamus with the Supreme Court no later than Nov. 20, 2017 and requesting that the Ninth Circuit stay its order pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the forthcoming petition. On Nov. 21, 2017, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the federal government's motion, noting that jurisdiction currently lies with the District Court and instructing the federal government that further relief must be sought in a new petition for mandamus.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the district court, Judge Alsup on Nov. 20, 2017, agreed to stay all discovery until Dec. 22, 2017 at which point the augmented administrative record will be due.</p>\r\n<p>On Dec. 1, 2017, the government filed notice that they appealed the Ninth's Circuit denial of mandamus relief and applied for a stay to the Supreme Court. On Dec. 21 in a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's denial and remanded the case, arguing that the district court should have stayed implementation of the Oct. 17 order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. The Supreme Court stated that the lower court should have \"first resolved the Government&rsquo;s threshold arguments (that the Acting Secretary&rsquo;s determination to rescind DACA is unreviewable because it is &ldquo;committed to agency discretion,&rdquo; 5 U. S. C. &sect;701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act deprives the District Court of jurisdiction). Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative record.\" 138 S. Ct. 443. The same day, the district court stayed the order compelling the government to complete the administrative record.</p>\r\n<p>On Jan. 9, 2018, the court denied the government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction from Nov. 1, 2017 and provided provisional relief to the plaintiffs. The order indicated the court would separately dismiss the government's motion to dismiss under for failure to state a claim. The court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering that DACA remain in effect on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the recession. However, the government did not need to process new applications from individuals who never before received deferred action. The court then granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to dismiss on Jan. 12, 2018 dismissing the plaintiffs' Regulatory Flexibility Act and equitable estoppel claims as well the individual plaintiffs' declaratory relief claims. The court sustained the plaintiffs' APA, due process, and equal protection claims (with a few exceptions from the various complaints of the related cases).</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit on Jan. 16, 2018. The government also sought certiorari from the Supreme Court on Jan. 18 while the Ninth Circuit appeal was pending, arguing that the Supreme Court's immediate review was warranted because of how long the appeal would take in the Ninth Circuit and how time sensitive the issue was. The Supreme Court denied cert without prejudice on Feb. 26, 2018, indicating the justices assume \"that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case.\"</p>\r\n<p>The related cases were consolidated in the Ninth Circuit for the purposes of appeal. In February and March 2018, the parties and amici filed their briefs, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on Nov. 8, 2018. The panel held that the government's decision to rescind DACA was reviewable because it was based on a belief that law foreclosed any alternative because the agency lacked authority rather than on exercise of discretion. The panel further concluded the decision was reviewable because the government based rescission only on the belief that DACA went beyond DHS' authority and so the APA's bar did not apply, and the decision did not fall within the three discrete occasions when the INA bars judicial review of DHS decisions. As to the merits of preliminary injunction, the panel held that \"DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion\" and the government's belief that DACA was illegal was wrong. 2018 WL 5833232. Thus, the panel concluded the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits in showing that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The panel also held that a nationwide injunction was appropriate because it \"promotes uniformity in immigration enforcement, and is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress.\" Id.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari on Nov. 5.</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in three DACA cases: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>NAACP v. Trump</em></a>, all of which were pending before different circuit courts of appeal. The Court consolidated the three cases (No. 18-587).</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS&rsquo;s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA, that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program, and that the rescission was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious in violation fo the APA. 591 U.S. 1.</p>\r\n<p>Following the Supreme Court's decision, in another case challenging the DACA recession, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16202\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>, the Fourth Circuit issued a mandate to reinstate DACA and set aside the recession memo on a nationwide basis on June 30, 2020. On July 17, 2020, the District Court of Maryland ordered DHS to reinstate DACA as it existed before the issuance of the recession memo and ordered DHS to resume accepting initial DACA applications.</p>\r\n<p>However, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf instead issued a memorandum entitled \"Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled 'Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" on July 28, 2020 (\"Wolf Memorandum\"). In this memo, Acting Secretary Wolf stated that he would reconsider DACA's future in light of the Supreme Court's decision. In the interim, the memo instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. Later in August, Deputy Director for Policy for USCIS Joseph Edlow issued a memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum.</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 3, 2020. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs substituted some of the defendants to reflect new individuals occupying the relevant roles and to add additional responsible officials, including Deputy Director for Policy Edlow. The amended complaint argued that Acting Secretary Wolf's actions were invalid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Action, Homeland Security Act, and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because he lacked proper authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum violated the APA because Wolf and Edlow acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the defendants from altering or limiting DACA program and vacating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda.</p>\r\n<p>Before any additional activity on the amended complaint in this case, on December 4, the court in another case challenging the Wolf Memorandum,<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of New York v. Trump</em></a>, ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017 after it found that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary. The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years.

On the day of his inauguration (January 20, 2021), President Biden signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General &ldquo;to preserve and fortify DACA.&rdquo; In light of potential additional agency action to implement the memorandum, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay further proceedings and vacate pending deadlines on March 22, 2021. They agreed to provide the court with status updates every 60 days. The first is due May 24, 2021. This case is ongoing.</p>",

On Jan. 9, 2018, the court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, which was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit.

Decided December 20, 2017\n  PER CURIAM. \n  This case arises from five related lawsuits that chal-\nlenge a determination adopted by the Acting Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The deter-\nmination, announced by the Acting Secretary, is to take \nimmediate steps to rescind a program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, by March 5, 2018.  \nThe Acting Secretary stated that her determination was \nbased in part on the Attorney General’s conclusion that \nDACA is unlawful and likely would be enjoined in poten-\ntially imminent litigation. \n  The five suits were filed in the United States District \nCourt  for  the  Northern  District  of  California,  and  the \nplaintiffs in those actions are the respondents in the mat-\nter now before this Court.  The defendants in the District \nCourt,  and  the  petitioners  here,  include  the  Govern- \nment of the United States, the Acting Secretary, and the \nPresident of the United States, all referred to here as the \nGovernment. \n  In the District Court litigation respondents argue that \nthe Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA in \nthe near future is unlawful because, among other reasons, \nit violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including \nthe equal protection guarantee implicit in that Clause. \n  The issue to be considered here involves respondents’ \ncontention that the administrative record the Government \nfiled to support the Acting Secretary’s determination to \nrescind DACA is incomplete.  The record consists of 256 \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,8 102-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 5873 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  22  ooff  44\n2  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \npages of documents, and the Government contends that it \ncontains all of the nondeliberative material considered by \nthe  Acting  Secretary  in  reaching  her  determination.  \n(Nearly  200  pages  consist  of  published  opinions  from \nvarious federal courts.) \n  On  October  17,  the  District  Court,  on  respondents’ \nmotion, ordered the Government to complete the adminis-\ntrative record.  See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Department \nof Homeland Security, App. C to Pet. for Mandamus, 2017 \nWL 4642324 (ND Cal., Oct. 17, 2017) (District Court Or-\nder).  The details of that order are recounted further be-\nlow.  See infra, at 3. \n  The Government petitioned for a writ of mandamus in \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of \nAppeals, in a divided opinion, denied the Government’s \npetition.  See 875 F. 3d 1200 (2017). \n  On November 19, three days after the Court of Appeals \nissued its opinion, respondents moved the District Court \nto stay its order requiring completion of the administra-\ntive  record  until  after  the  District  Court  resolved  the \nGovernment’s motion to dismiss and respondents’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Motion to Stay in No. \n17–cv–5211 (Nov. 19, 2017), Doc. 190.  The District Court \ndid  not  grant  respondents’  request,  instead  staying  its \norder for one month. \n  Still objecting to the District Court’s order, the Govern-\nment now seeks relief in this Court.  It has filed here a \npetition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court, or, \nin the alternative, for a writ of certiorari to the Court of \nAppeals. \n  The Court now grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, \nvacates the order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, and remands the case. \n  The District Court’s October 17 order requires the Gov-\nernment  to  turn  over  all  “emails,  letters,  memoranda, \nnotes, media items, opinions and other materials” that fall \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,8 102-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 5873 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  33  ooff  44\n  Cite as: 583 U.

Under the specific facts of this \ncase, the District Court should have granted respondents’ \nmotion  on  November  19  to  stay  implementation  of  the \nchallenged October 17 order and first resolved the Gov-\nernment’s  threshold  arguments  (that  the  Acting  Secre-\ntary’s  determination  to  rescind  DACA  is  unreviewable \nbecause it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act \ndeprives the District Court of jurisdiction).  Either of those \narguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for \nthe District Court to examine a complete administrative \nrecord.  \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901573,8 102-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 5873 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  44  ooff  44\n4  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \n  On remand of the case, the Court of Appeals shall take \nappropriate  action  so  that  the  following  steps  can  be \ntaken.

C. §1292(b) if appropriate.   Thereafter, the \nCourt of Appeals or the District Court in the first instance \nmay consider whether narrower amendments to the record \nare necessary and appropriate.

Detroit Timber & Lumber  Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus  \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY  ET AL. v. \nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY  OF  \nCALIFORNIA ET AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 18–587.  Argued November 12, 2019—Decided June 18, 2020*  \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo-\nrandum announcing an immigration relief program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows certain unauthor-\nized aliens who arrived in the United States as children to apply for a \ntwo-year forbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief become \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  Some  \n700,000 aliens have availed themselves of this opportunity. \n     Two years later, DHS expanded DACA eligibility and created a re-\nlated program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).  If implemented, that program \nwould have made 4.3 million parents of U.  S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents eligible for the same forbearance from removal, work  \neligibility, and other benefits as DACA recipients.  Texas, joined by 25 \nother States, secured a nationwide preliminary injunction barring im-\nplementation of both the DACA expansion and DAPA.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit upheld the injunction, concluding that the program violated the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), which carefully defines eligi-\nbility for benefits.  This Court affirmed by an equally divided vote, and \n—————— \n*Together  with No. 18–588, Trump, President of the United States, et  \n \nal. v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et al., \non certiorari before judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for  \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and No. 18–589, Wolf, Acting Secretary \nof Homeland  Security, et al. v.  Batalla  Vidal et al., on certiorari before \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nthe litigation then continued in the District Court.   \n     In June 2017, following a change in Presidential administrations,  \nDHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum, citing, among other reasons, \nthe ongoing suit by Texas  and new policy priorities.  That September, \nthe Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nElaine C. Duke that DACA shared DAPA’s legal flaws and should also \nbe rescinded.  The next day, Duke acted on that advice.  Taking into \nconsideration the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court rulings and the At-\ntorney General’s letter, Duke decided to terminate the program.  She \nexplained that DHS would no longer accept new applications, but that \nexisting DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within six \nmonths could apply for a two-year renewal.  For all other DACA recip-\nients, previously issued grants of relief would expire on their own \nterms, with no prospect for renewal.   \n     Several groups of plaintiffs challenged Duke’s decision to rescind  \nDACA, claiming that it was arbitrary  and capricious in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and infringed the equal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  District  \nCourts in California (Regents, No. 18–587), New York (Batalla Vidal, \nNo. 18–589), and the District of Columbia (NAACP, No. 18–588) all  \nruled for the plaintiffs.  Each court rejected the Government’s argu-\nments that the claims were unreviewable under the APA and that the  \nINA deprived the courts of jurisdiction. In Regents and Batalla Vidal, \nthe District Courts further held that the equal protection claims were \nadequately alleged, and they entered coextensive nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs were likely \nto succeed on their APA claims.  The District Court in  NAACP took a \ndifferent approach.  It deferred ruling on  the equal protection chal-\nlenge but granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their \nAPA claim, finding that the rescission was inadequately explained.  \nThe court then stayed its order for 90 days to permit DHS to reissue a \nmemorandum rescinding  DACA, this time with a fuller explanation of \nthe conclusion that DACA was unlawful.  Two months later, Duke’s  \nsuccessor, Secretary Kirstjen M.  Nielsen, responded to  the court’s  or-\nder.  She declined to disturb or replace Duke’s rescission decision and \ninstead explained why she thought her predecessor’s decision was \nsound.  In addition to reiterating the illegality conclusion, she offered \nseveral new justifications for the rescission.  The Government moved  \nfor the District Court to reconsider in light of this additional explana-\ntion, but the court concluded that the new reasoning failed to elaborate \nmeaningfully on the illegality rationale.  \n     The Government appealed  the various District Court  decisions to  \nthe Second, Ninth, and D.  C. Circuits, respectively.  While those ap-\npeals were pending, the Government filed three petitions  for certiorari  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nbefore judgment.  Following  the Ninth Circuit affirmance in Regents, \nthis Court granted  certiorari.  \nHeld: The judgment in No. 18–587 is vacated in part and reversed in \npart; the judgment in No. 18–588 is affirmed; the February 13, 2018 \norder in No. 18–589 is vacated, the November 9, 2017 order is affirmed  \nin part, and the March 29, 2018 order is reversed in part; and all of the \ncases are remanded. \nNo. 18–587, 908 F. 3d 476, vacated in part and reversed in part; No. 18–\n588, affirmed; and No. 18–589, February  13, 2018 order vacated, No-\nvember 9, 2017 order affirmed in part, and March 29, 2018 order re-\nversed in part; all cases remanded. \n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to  \nPart IV, concluding: \n   1. DHS’s rescission decision  is reviewable under the APA and is \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.  Pp. 9–13. \n     (a) The APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” of agency ac-\ntion, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140, can be rebut-\nted by showing that the “agency action is committed to agency discre-\ntion by law,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  In Heckler v. Chaney, the Court held  \nthat this narrow exception includes an agency’s decision not to insti-\ntute an enforcement action.  470 U. S. 821, 831–832.  The Government  \ncontends that DACA is a general non-enforcement policy  equivalent to \nthe individual non-enforcement decision in  Chaney.  But the DACA  \nMemorandum  did not merely decline to institute enforcement proceed-\nings; it created a program for conferring  affirmative immigration re-\nlief.  Therefore,  unlike  the  non-enforcement  decision  in  Chaney, \nDACA’s creation—and its rescission—is an “action [that] provides a  \nfocus for judicial review.”   Id., at 832.  In addition, by virtue of receiving \ndeferred action, 700,000 DACA recipients may  request work  authori-\nzation and are eligible for Social Security and Medicare.  Access to such  \nbenefits is an interest “courts often are called upon to protect.”  Ibid.   \nDACA’s rescission is thus subject to review under the APA.  Pp. 9–12.\n     (b) The two jurisdictional provisions of the INA invoked by the \nGovernment do not apply.  Title 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), which bars re-\nview of claims arising from “action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to re-\nmove an alien,” is inapplicable where, as here, the parties do not chal-\nlenge any removal proceedings.  And the rescission is not a decision “to  \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders” \nwithin the meaning of §1252(g).  Pp. 12–13. \n   2. DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary  and capricious un-\nder the APA.  Pp. 13–26. \n     (a) In assessing the rescission, the Government urges the Court to \nconsider not just the contemporaneous explanation offered by Acting \nSecretary Duke but also  the additional reasons supplied by Secretary \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nNielsen nine months later.  Judicial review of agency action, however, \nis limited to “the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the \naction.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758.  If those grounds are \ninadequate, a court may  remand for the agency to offer “a fuller expla-\nnation of the agency’s reasoning at the time of the agency  action,” Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.  LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(emphasis added), or to “deal with the problem afresh” by taking  new  \nagency action, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.  S. 194, 201.  Because Sec-\nretary Nielsen chose not to take new action, she was limited to elabo-\nrating on the agency’s original reasons.  But her reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor and consists primarily of imper-\nmissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Citizens to Preserve  Overton Park, \nInc. v.  Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 420.  The rule requiring a new decision  \nbefore considering new reasons is not merely a  formality.  It serves \nimportant administrative law values by  promoting agency accounta-\nbility to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not \nsimply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.  \nEach of these values would be markedly undermined if this Court al-\nlowed DHS to  rely on reasons offered nine months after the rescission \nand after three different courts had identified flaws in the original ex-\nplanation.  Pp. 13–17. \n     (b)  Acting Secretary Duke’s  rescission memorandum failed to con-\nsider important aspects of the problem before the agency.  Although \nDuke was bound by the Attorney General’s determination that DACA \nis illegal, see 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1), deciding  how best to address that \ndetermination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.   \nActing Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority \nin winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope \nof her discretion.  The Attorney General concluded that the legal de-\nfects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.  \nThe Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on \nDAPA’s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it ex-\ntended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens.  But the \ndefining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHS’s decision to defer re-\nmoval, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance \ncomponent from the associated benefits eligibility.  Eliminating bene-\nfits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely \nwithin Duke’s  discretion.  Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in \nher decision, Duke treated the Attorney General’s conclusion regard-\ning the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and \nforbearance, without explanation.  That reasoning repeated the error \nin Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.  \nv. State Farm— treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy \nas sufficient to rescind the entire policy.   463 U. S. 29, 51.  While DHS \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \nwas not required to “consider all policy alternatives,” ibid., deferred \naction was “within the ambit of the existing” policy,  ibid.; indeed, it \nwas the centerpiece of the policy.  In failing to consider the option to \nretain deferred action, Duke “failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned \nanalysis.’ ” Id., at 57. \n \n   That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary  and capri-\ncious, but it was not the only defect.  Duke also failed to address \nwhether there was “legitimate reliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  \nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742.  Certain  \nfeatures of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance \ninterests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first \ninstance. DHS has flexibility in addressing  any reliance interests and \ncould have considered various accommodations.  While the agency was \nnot required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess \nthe existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them \nagainst competing policy concerns.  Its failure to do so was arbitrary  \nand capricious.  Pp. 17–26.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondents’ claims fail \nto establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by \nanimus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Pp. 27–29. \nROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the  Court, except as to Part IV.   \nGINSBURG,  BREYER,  and KAGAN, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and SO-\nTOMAYOR, J., joined as to all but Part IV.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt, except as to Part IV. \n  In the summer of 2012, the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) announced an immigration program known as \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  That \nprogram allows certain unauthorized aliens who entered \nthe United States as children to apply for a two-year for-\nbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief are also \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  \nSome  700,000  aliens  have  availed  themselves  of  this \nopportunity. \n  Five years later, the Attorney General advised DHS to \nrescind DACA, based on his conclusion that it was unlaw-\nful. The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memoran-\ndum terminating the program on that basis.  The termina-\ntion  was  challenged  by  affected  individuals  and  third\nparties who alleged, among other things, that the Acting \nSecretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by failing to adequately address important factors \nbearing on her decision.  For the reasons that follow, we \nconclude that the Acting Secretary did violate the APA, and \nthat the rescission must be vacated.  \nI \nA \n  In June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued \na memorandum announcing an immigration relief program \nfor “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 18–587, p. 97a  \n(App. to Pet. for Cert.).  Known as DACA, the program ap-\nplies to childhood arrivals who were under age 31 in 2012;\nhave continuously resided here since 2007; are current stu-\ndents, have completed high school, or are honorably dis-\ncharged veterans; have not been convicted of any serious \ncrimes; and do not threaten national security or public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsafety.  Id., at 98a.  DHS concluded that individuals who \nmeet these criteria warrant favorable treatment under the \nimmigration laws because they “lacked the intent to violate\nthe law,” are “productive” contributors to our society, and \n“know only this country as home.”  Id., at 98a–99a. \n  “[T]o prevent [these] low priority  individuals from being \nremoved from the United States,” the DACA Memorandum \ninstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “exer-\ncise prosecutorial discretion[] on an individual basis . . . by\n \ndeferring action for a period of two years, subject to re-\nnewal.”  Id., at 100a.  In addition, it directs U. S. Citizen-\nship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to “accept applica-\ntions to determine whether these individuals qualify for \nwork authorization during this period of deferred action,”  \nid., at 101a, as permitted under regulations long predating \nDACA’s creation, see 8  CFR §274a.12(c)(14) (2012) (permit-\nting work authorization for deferred action recipients who \nestablish “economic necessity”); 46 Fed. Reg. 25080–25081 \n(1981) (similar). Pursuant to other regulations, deferred ac-\ntion recipients are considered “lawfully present” for pur-\nposes of, and therefore eligible  to receive, Social Security  \nand Medicare benefits.  See 8 CFR §1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 CFR\n§417.422(h) (2012). \n  In November 2014, two years after DACA was promul-\ngated,  DHS  issued  a  memorandum  announcing  that  it \nwould expand DACA eligibility by removing the age cap, \nshifting the date-of-entry requirement from 2007 to 2010, \nand extending the deferred action and work authorization \nperiod to three years.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a–107a.  In \nthe same memorandum, DHS created a new, related pro-\ngram known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  That program \nwould have authorized deferred action for up to 4.3 million \nparents whose children were U. S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents.  These parents were to enjoy the same for-\nbearance,  work  eligibility,  and  other  benefits  as  DACA \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nrecipients.\n  Before the DAPA Memorandum was implemented, 26 \nStates, led by Texas, filed suit in the Southern District of \nTexas.  The States contended that DAPA and the DACA  \nexpansion violated the APA’s notice and comment require-\nment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the \nExecutive’s duty under the Take Care Clause of the Consti-\ntution. The District Court found that the States were likely \nto succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims and  \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring imple-\nmentation of both DAPA and the DACA expansion.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677–678 (2015). \n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.  Texas v. United  \nStates, 809 F. 3d 134, 188 (2015).  In opposing the injunc-\ntion, the Government argued that the DAPA Memorandum \nreflected an unreviewable exercise of the Government’s en-\nforcement discretion. The Fifth Circuit majority disagreed.  \nIt reasoned that the deferred action described in the DAPA  \nMemorandum was “much more than nonenforcement: It \nwould affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated \nbenefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”   Id., at 166.  \nFrom this, the majority concluded that the creation of the \nDAPA program was not an unreviewable action “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  Id., at 169 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2)).\n  The majority then upheld the injunction on two grounds.  \nIt first concluded the States were likely to succeed on their \nprocedural claim that the DAPA Memorandum was a sub-\nstantive rule that was required to undergo notice and com-\nment.  It then held that the APA required DAPA to be set \naside because the program was “manifestly contrary” to the \nINA, which “expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes” to “receive the benefits” as-\nsociated with “lawful presence” and to qualify for work  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthorization, 809 F. 3d, at 179–181, 186 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Judge King dissented. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote, which meant that no opinion was is-\nsued.  United States v.  Texas, 579 U. S. ___ (2016) (per cu-\nriam).  For the next year, litigation over DAPA and the\nDACA  expansion  continued  in  the  Southern  District  of \nTexas, while implementation of those policies remained \nenjoined. \n  Then, in June 2017, following a change in Presidential \nadministrations, DHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum.  \nIn explaining that decision, DHS cited the preliminary in-\njunction  and  ongoing  litigation  in  Texas,  the  fact  that \nDAPA had never taken effect, and the new administration’s  \nimmigration enforcement priorities.\n  Three  months  later,  in  September  2017,  Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson B. Sessions III sent a letter to Acting Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke, “advis[ing]” \nthat DHS “should rescind” DACA as well.  App. 877.  Citing\nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion and this Court’s equally divided \naffirmance, the Attorney General concluded that DACA \nshared the “same legal . . . defects that the courts recog-\nnized as to DAPA” and was “likely” to meet a similar fate.   \nId., at 878. “In light of the costs and burdens” that a rescis-\nsion would “impose[] on DHS,” the Attorney General urged \n \nDHS  to  “consider  an  orderly  and  efficient  wind-down \nprocess.”  Ibid.  \n  The next day, Duke acted on the Attorney General’s ad-\nvice.  In her decision memorandum, Duke summarized the  \nhistory of the DACA and DAPA  programs, the Fifth Circuit \nopinion and ensuing affirmance, and the contents of the At-\ntorney General’s letter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–117a.  \n“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the \nFifth Circuit’s rulings” and the “letter from the Attorney \nGeneral,” she concluded that the “DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Id., at 117a. \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Duke then detailed how the program would be wound \ndown: No new applications would be accepted, but DHS\nwould entertain applications for two-year renewals from \nDACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within \nsix months.  For all other DACA recipients, previously is-\nsued  grants  of  deferred  action  and  work  authorization  \nwould not be revoked but would expire on their own terms, \nwith no prospect for renewal.  Id., at 117a–118a. \nB \n  Within days of Acting Secretary  Duke’s rescission an-\nnouncement, multiple groups of plaintiffs ranging from in-\ndividual DACA recipients and States to the Regents of the \nUniversity of California and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People challenged her decision \nin the U. S. District Courts for the Northern District of Cal-\nifornia (Regents, No. 18–587), the Eastern District of New \nYork (Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589), and the District of Co-\nlumbia (NAACP, No. 18–588).  The relevant claims are that \nthe rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of\nthe APA and that it infringed the equal protection guaran-\ntee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.1  \n  All three District Courts ruled for the plaintiffs, albeit at \ndifferent stages of the proceedings.2  In doing so, each court \nrejected the Government’s threshold arguments that the \n—————— \n1Plaintiffs also raised notice and comment claims, which uniformly \n \nfailed below, and assorted due process challenges, some of which sur-\nvived motions to dismiss.  Those claims are not before us. \n2In a related challenge not at issue here, the District Court for the \n \nDistrict of Maryland granted partial summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment.  Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Se-\ncurity, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  After the Government filed petitions \nfor certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that deci-\nsion and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and ca-\npricious. Casa de  Maryland  v.  United States Dept. of Homeland Security, \n924 F. 3d 684 (2019), cert. pending, No. 18–1469.  The Fourth Circuit has  \nsince stayed its mandate.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims were unreviewable under the APA and that the INA \ndeprived the court of jurisdiction.  298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n223–224, 234–235 (DC 2018); 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1029–\n1033 (ND Cal. 2018); 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150, 153–154 \n(EDNY 2017).\nIn Regents and Batalla Vidal, the District Courts held  \nthat the equal protection claims were adequately alleged.  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1315 (ND Cal. 2018); 291 F. Supp. 3d \n260, 279 (EDNY 2018).  Those courts also entered coexten-\nsive nationwide preliminary injunctions, based on the con-\nclusion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the mer-\nits of their claims that the rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious. These injunctions did not require DHS to accept \nnew applications, but did order the agency to allow DACA\nrecipients to “renew their enrollments.”  279 F.  Supp. 3d, at \n1048; see 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437 (EDNY 2018). \nIn  NAACP,  the  D. C.  District  Court  took  a  different  \ncourse.  In  April 2018, it deferred ruling on the equal pro-\ntection challenge but granted partial summary judgment to \nthe plaintiffs on their APA claim, holding that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s “conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in [the agency’s] view of DACA’s lawful-\nness.”  298 F. Supp. 3d, at 243.  The District Court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit DHS to “reissue a memoran-\ndum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller expla-\nnation for the determination that the program lacks statu-\ntory and constitutional authority.”  Id., at 245.  \n  Two months later, Duke’s successor, Secretary Kirstjen \nM. Nielsen, responded via memorandum.  App. to Pet. for\nCert. 120a–126a.  She explained that, “[h]aving considered \nthe Duke memorandum,” she “decline[d] to disturb” the re-\nscission. Id., at 121a.  Secretary Nielsen went on to articu-\nlate her “understanding” of Duke’s memorandum, identify-\ning  three  reasons  why,  in  Nielsen’s  estimation,  “the\ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, \nsound.”  Ibid.  First, she reiterated that, “as the Attorney  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nGeneral concluded, the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  \nId., at 122a. Second, she added that, regardless, the agency\nhad “serious doubts about [DACA’s] legality” and, for law \nenforcement reasons, wanted to avoid “legally questiona-\nble” policies.   Id., at 123a.  Third, she identified multiple \npolicy reasons for rescinding DACA, including (1) the belief \nthat any class-based immigration relief should come from \nCongress,  not  through  executive  non-enforcement;  (2)\nDHS’s preference for exercising prosecutorial discretion on \n“a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and (3) the im-\nportance of “project[ing] a message” that immigration laws \nwould be enforced against all classes and categories of al-\niens.  Id., at 123a–124a.  In her final paragraph, Secretary \nNielsen acknowledged the “asserted reliance interests” in \nDACA’s continuation but concluded that they did not “out-\nweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the\nother reasons” for the rescission discussed in her memoran-\ndum.  Id., at 125a. \n  The Government asked the D. C. District Court to revise  \nits prior order in light of the reasons provided by Secretary \nNielsen, but the court declined.  In the court’s view, the new \nmemorandum, which “fail[ed] to elaborate meaningfully” \non the agency’s illegality rationale, still did not provide an \nadequate explanation for the September 2017 rescission.  \n315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 460, 473–474 (2018). \n  The Government appealed the various District Court de-\ncisions to the Second, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, respec-\ntively.  In November 2018, while those appeals were pend-\ning, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions \nfor certiorari before judgment.  After the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the nationwide injunction in  Regents, see 908 F. 3d  \n476 (2018), but before rulings from the other two Circuits, \nwe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases for ar-\ngument.  588 U.

All parties agree that it may.  The dispute\nis instead primarily about the procedure the agency fol-\nlowed in doing so. \n  The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal\nagencies are accountable to the public and their actions \nsubject to review by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U. S. 788, 796 (1992).  It requires agencies to engage in\n“reasoned decisionmaking,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.  S.  \n743, 750 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), and di-\nrects that agency actions be “set aside” if they are “arbi-\ntrary” or “capricious,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).

S. 502, 513 (2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted), but instead to assess only whether the de-\ncision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors \nand whether there has been a clear error of judgment,” Cit-\nizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, \n416 (1971).\n  But before determining whether the rescission was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, we must first address the Govern-\nment’s contentions that DHS’s decision is unreviewable  \nunder the APA and outside this Court’s jurisdiction. \nA \n  The APA establishes  a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview [for] one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-\ntion.’”  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140  \n \n(1967) (quoting §702).  That presumption can be rebutted \nby a showing that the relevant statute “preclude[s]” review,  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n§701(a)(1),  or  that  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to \nagency discretion by law,” §701(a)(2).  The latter exception \nis at issue here. \n  To “honor the presumption of review, we have read the \nexception in §701(a)(2) quite narrowly,” Weyerhaeuser Co. \nv. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 12), confining it to those rare “adminis-\ntrative decision[s] traditionally left to agency discretion,”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 191 (1993).  This limited cat-\negory of unreviewable actions includes an agency’s decision \nnot  to  institute  enforcement  proceedings,  Heckler  v.  \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985), and it is on that ex-\nception that the Government primarily relies. \nIn  Chaney,  several  death-row  inmates  petitioned  the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to take enforcement \naction against two States to prevent their use of certain \ndrugs for lethal injection.  The Court held that the FDA’s \ndenial of that petition was presumptively unreviewable in \nlight of the well-established “tradition” that “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce” is “generally commit-\nted to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id.,  at 831.  We \nidentified a constellation of reasons that underpin this tra-\ndition. To start, a non-enforcement decision “often involves \na  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  \nare  peculiarly  within  [the  agency’s]  expertise,”  such  as \n“whether the particular enforcement action requested best \nfits the agency’s overall policies.”  Ibid.  The decision also  \nmirrors, “to some extent,” a prosecutor’s decision not to in-\ndict, which has “long been regarded as the special province\nof the Executive Branch.”  Id., at 832.  And, as a practical \nmatter, “when an agency refuses to act” there is no action \nto “provide[] a focus for judicial review.”  Ibid. \n \n  The Government contends that a general non-enforcement \npolicy  is  equivalent  to  the  individual  non-enforcement \ndecision at issue in  Chaney.  In each case, the Government  \nargues, the agency must balance factors peculiarly within  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nits expertise, and does so in a manner akin to a criminal \nprosecutor.  Building on that premise, the Government ar-\ngues that the rescission of a non-enforcement policy is no  \ndifferent—for purposes of reviewability—from the adoption \nof that policy.  While the rescission may lead to increased \nenforcement, it does not, by itself, constitute a particular  \nenforcement action.  Applying this logic to the facts here, \nthe Government submits that DACA is a non-enforcement  \npolicy and that its rescission is therefore unreviewable. \n  But we need not test this chain of reasoning because \nDACA is not simply a non-enforcement policy.  For starters, \nthe DACA Memorandum did not merely “refus[e] to insti-\ntute proceedings” against a particular entity or even a par-\nticular class.   Ibid.  Instead, it directed USCIS to “establish  \na clear and efficient process” for identifying individuals who \nmet the enumerated criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  \nBased on this directive, USCIS solicited applications from \neligible aliens, instituted a standardized review process, \nand sent formal notices indicating whether the alien would \nreceive the two-year forbearance.  These proceedings are ef-\nfectively “adjudicat[ions].”  Id., at 117a.  And the result of \nthese adjudications—DHS’s decision to “grant deferred ac-\ntion,” Brief for Petitioners 45—is an “affirmative act of ap-\nproval,” the very opposite of a “refus[al] to act,” Chaney, 470  \nU. S., at 831–832.  In short, the DACA Memorandum does \nnot announce a passive non-enforcement policy; it created \na program for conferring affirmative immigration relief.  \nThe creation of that program—and its rescission—is an “ac-\ntion [that] provides a focus for judicial review.”  Id., at 832. \n  The  benefits  attendant  to  deferred  action  provide \nfurther confirmation that DACA is more than simply a  \nnon-enforcement policy.  As described above, by virtue of \nreceiving deferred action, the 700,000 DACA recipients may \nrequest work authorization and are eligible for Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare.  See supra, at 3.  Unlike an agency’s re-\nfusal to take requested enforcement action, access to these \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \ntypes of benefits is an interest “courts often are called upon \nto protect.”  Chaney, 470 U. S., at 832.  See also Barnhart v.  \nThomas, 540 U. S. 20 (2003) (reviewing eligibility determi-\nnation for Social Security benefits).\n  Because the DACA program  is more than a non-enforce-\nment policy, its rescission is subject to review under the\nAPA.  \nB \n  The Government also invokes two jurisdictional provi-\nsions of the INA as independent bars to review.  Neither \napplies. \n  Section 1252(b)(9) bars review of claims arising from “ac-\ntion[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  66 \nStat. 209, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9).  That tar-\ngeted language is not aimed at this sort of case.  As we have  \nsaid before, §1252(b)(9) “does not present a jurisdictional \nbar” where those bringing suit “are not asking  for review of \nan order of removal,” “the decision . . . to seek removal,” or  \n“the process by which . .  . removability will be determined.”  \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (plu-\nrality opinion) (slip op., at 10–11);  id., at ___ (BREYER, J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 31).  And it is certainly not a bar\nwhere, as here, the parties are not challenging any removal \nproceedings.\n  Section 1252(g) is similarly narrow.  That provision limits \nreview of cases “arising from” decisions “to commence pro-\nceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.”  \n§1252(g). We have previously rejected as “implausible” the \nGovernment’s suggestion that §1252(g) covers “all claims \narising from deportation proceedings” or imposes “a general \njurisdictional  limitation.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 482 (1999).  The re-\nscission, which revokes a deferred action program with as-\nsociated benefits, is not a decision to “commence proceed-\nings,”  much  less  to  “adjudicate”  a  case  or  “execute”  a  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nremoval order. \n  With these preliminary arguments out of the way, we \nproceed to the merits. \nIII  \nA \n  Deciding  whether  agency  action  was  adequately  ex-\nplained  requires,  first,  knowing  where  to  look  for  the \nagency’s explanation. The natural starting point here is the \nexplanation provided by Acting Secretary Duke when she \nannounced the rescission in September 2017. But the Gov-\nernment urges us to go on and consider the June 2018 mem-\norandum submitted by Secretary Nielsen as well.  That  \nmemo was prepared after the D. C. District Court vacated  \nthe Duke rescission and gave DHS an opportunity to “reis-\nsue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing \na fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks statutory and constitutional authority.”  298 F. Supp. \n3d, at 245. According to the Government, the Nielsen Mem-\norandum is properly before us because it was invited by the \nDistrict Court and reflects the views of the Secretary of  \nHomeland Security—the official responsible for immigra-\ntion policy. Respondents disagree, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemorandum, issued nine months after the rescission, im-\npermissibly asserts prudential and policy reasons not relied \nupon by Duke. \n  It is a “foundational principle of administrative law” that \njudicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Michigan, \n576 U. S., at 758.  If those grounds are inadequate, a court \nmay remand for the agency to do one of two things: First, \nthe agency can offer “a fuller explanation of  the agency’s \nreasoning at the time of the agency action.” Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(1990)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Alpharma,  Inc.  v.  \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nLeavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 5–6 (CADC 2006) (Garland, J.) (per-\nmitting an agency to provide an “amplified articulation” of \na prior “conclusory” observation (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  This route has important limitations.  When  an  \nagency’s initial explanation “indicate[s] the determinative \nreason for the final action taken,” the agency may elaborate \nlater on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new \nones. Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam).  \nAlternatively,  the  agency  can  “deal  with  the  problem\nafresh” by taking new agency action.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U. S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II).  An agency taking \nthis route is not limited to its prior reasons but must comply \nwith the procedural requirements for new agency action. \n  The District Court’s remand thus presented DHS with a \nchoice: rest on the Duke Memorandum while elaborating on \nits prior reasoning, or issue a new rescission bolstered by \nnew reasons absent from the Duke Memorandum.  Secre-\ntary Nielsen took the first path. Rather than making a new\ndecision, she “decline[d] to disturb the Duke memoran-\ndum’s rescission” and instead “provide[d] further explana-\ntion” for that action.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.  Indeed,  \nthe Government’s subsequent request for reconsideration \ndescribed the Nielsen Memorandum as “additional expla-\nnation for [Duke’s] decision” and asked the District Court \nto “leave in  place [Duke’s] September 5, 2017 decision to re-\nscind the DACA policy.”  Motion to Revise Order in No. 17– \ncv–1907 etc. (D DC), pp. 2, 19. Contrary to the position of \nthe  Government  before  this  Court,  and  of  JUSTICE  \nKAVANAUGH in dissent, post, at 4 (opinion concurring in \njudgment in part and dissenting in part), the Nielsen Mem-\norandum was by its own terms not a new rule implementing \na new policy.\n  Because Secretary Nielsen chose to elaborate on the rea-\nsons for the initial rescission rather than take new admin-\nistrative action, she was limited to the agency’s original rea-\nsons, and her explanation “must be viewed critically” to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nensure that the rescission is not upheld on the basis of im-\npermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Overton Park, 401 \nU. S., at 420.  But despite purporting to explain the Duke \nMemorandum, Secretary Nielsen’s reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor.  Acting Secretary \nDuke  rested the rescission on the conclusion that DACA is \nunlawful.  Period.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.  By con-\ntrast, Secretary Nielsen’s new memorandum offered three \n“separate and independently sufficient reasons” for the re-\nscission, id., at 122a, only the first of which is the conclusion \nthat DACA is illegal. \n  Her second reason is that DACA is, at minimum, legally \nquestionable and should be terminated to maintain public\nconfidence in the rule of law and avoid burdensome litiga-\ntion.  No such justification can be found in the Duke Mem-\norandum. Legal uncertainty is, of course, related to illegal-\nity.  But the two justifications are meaningfully distinct, \nespecially in this context.  While an agency might, for one \nreason or another, choose to do nothing in the face of uncer-\ntainty, illegality presumably requires remedial action of \nsome sort.  \n  The policy reasons that Secretary Nielsen cites as a third \nbasis for the rescission are also nowhere to be found in the \nDuke Memorandum.  That document makes no mention of \na preference for legislative fixes, the superiority of case-by-\ncase decisionmaking, the importance of sending a message \nof robust enforcement, or any other policy consideration.  \nNor are these points included in the legal analysis from the \nFifth Circuit and the Attorney General.  They can be viewed\nonly as impermissible post hoc rationalizations and thus  \nare not properly before us.\n  The Government, echoed by JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, pro-\ntests that requiring a new decision before considering Niel-\nsen’s new justifications would be “an idle and useless for-\nmality.”  NLRB  v. Wyman-Gordon  Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766, \n \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nn. 6 (1969) (plurality opinion).  See also post,  at 5.  Proce-\ndural requirements can often seem such. But here the rule \nserves important values of administrative law.  Requiring \na new decision before considering new reasons promotes \n“agency accountability,” Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., \n476 U. S. 610, 643 (1986), by ensuring that parties and the \npublic can respond fully and in a timely manner to an \nagency’s exercise of authority.  Considering only contempo-\nraneous explanations for agency action also instills confi-\ndence that the reasons given are not simply “convenient lit-\nigating position[s].”  Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham  \nCorp., 567 U. S. 142, 155 (2012) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Permitting agencies to invoke belated justifica-\ntions, on the other hand, can upset “the orderly functioning \nof the process of review,” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. \n80, 94 (1943), forcing both litigants and courts to chase a\nmoving target.  Each of these values would be markedly un-\ndermined were we to allow DHS to rely on reasons offered \nnine months after Duke announced the rescission and after \nthree different courts had identified flaws in the original \nexplanation.\nJUSTICE  KAVANAUGH  asserts  that  this  “foundational \nprinciple of administrative law,” Michigan, 576 U. S., at \n758, actually limits only what lawyers may argue, not what \nagencies may do. Post, at 5.  While it is true that the Court \nhas often rejected justifications belatedly advanced by ad-\nvocates, we refer to this as a prohibition on post hoc ration-\nalizations, not advocate rationalizations, because the prob-\nlem is the timing, not the speaker.  The functional reasons \nfor  requiring  contemporaneous  explanations  apply  with \nequal force regardless whether post hoc justifications are \nraised in court by those appearing on behalf of the agency\nor by agency officials themselves.  See American Textile  \nMfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 539 (1981) \n(“[T]he post hoc rationalizations of the agency . . . cannot \nserve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”); Overton  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPark, 401 U. S., at 419 (rejecting “litigation affidavits” from \nagency officials as “merely ‘post hoc’ rationalizations”).3  \n  Justice Holmes famously wrote that “[m]en must turn  \nsquare corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock \nIsland, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143  \n(1920).  But it is also true, particularly when so much is at \nstake, that “the Government should turn square corners in \ndealing with the people.”  St. Regis Paper Co. v. United \nStates, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting).  The \nbasic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.  This is not the  \ncase for cutting corners to allow DHS to rely upon reasons \nabsent from its original decision.  \nB \n  We turn, finally, to whether DHS’s decision to rescind \nDACA  was arbitrary and capricious.  As noted earlier, Act-\ning Secretary Duke’s justification for the rescission was suc-\ncinct: “Taking into consideration” the Fifth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that DAPA was unlawful because it conferred benefits \nin violation of the INA, and the Attorney General’s conclu-\nsion that DACA was unlawful for the same reason, she \nconcluded—without elaboration—that the “DACA program \nshould be terminated.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.4  \n—————— \n3  JUSTICE  KAVANAUGH further argues that the contemporaneous expla-\nnation  requirement  applies  only  to  agency  adjudications,  not  rule-\nmakings.  Post,  at 5–6 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part).  But he  cites no  authority limiting this basic principle—\nwhich the Court regularly articulates in the context of rulemakings—to \nadjudications.  The Government does not even raise this unheralded ar-\ngument.  \n4The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke  also focused \n \non litigation risk.  Although the background section of her memo refer-\nences a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge \nDACA, the memo never asserts that the rescission was intended to avert \nlitigation.  And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that the policy \nwas unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or de-\nfended in its current form—it is difficult to see how the risk of litigation  \n \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Respondents maintain that this explanation is deficient \nfor three reasons.  Their first and second arguments work \nin tandem, claiming that the Duke Memorandum does not \nadequately explain the conclusion that DACA is unlawful,  \nand that this conclusion is, in any event, wrong.  While \nthose arguments carried the day in the lower courts, in our \nview they overlook an important constraint on Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s decisionmaking authority—she was bound by\nthe Attorney General’s legal determination. \n  The same statutory provision that establishes the Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security’s authority to administer and en-\nforce immigration laws limits that authority, specifying \nthat, with respect to “all questions of law,” the determina-\ntions of the Attorney General “shall be controlling.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1103(a)(1).  Respondents are aware of this con-\nstraint.  Indeed they emphasized the point in the reviewa-\nbility sections of their briefs.  But in their merits argu-\nments, respondents never addressed whether or how this \nunique statutory provision might affect our review.  They\ndid not discuss whether Duke was required to explain a le-\ngal conclusion that was not hers to make.  Nor  did they dis-\ncuss whether the current suits challenging Duke’s rescis-\nsion decision, which everyone agrees was within her legal \nauthority under the INA, are proper vehicles for attacking \nthe Attorney General’s legal conclusion. \n  Because of these gaps in respondents’ briefing, we do not\nevaluate the claims challenging the explanation and cor-\nrectness of the illegality conclusion.  Instead we focus our \nattention on respondents’ third argument—that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke “failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of\nthe  problem”  before  her.  Motor  Vehicle  Mfrs.  Assn.  of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983). \n—————— \ncarried any independent weight.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Whether DACA is illegal is, of course, a legal determina-\ntion, and therefore a question for the Attorney General.  But \ndeciding how best to address a finding of illegality moving \nforward can involve important policy choices, especially \nwhen the finding concerns a program with the breadth of \nDACA.  Those policy choices are for DHS. \n  Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretion-\nary authority in winding down the program.  See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 117a–118a (listing the Acting Secretary’s de-\ncisions on eight transition issues).   Among other things, she \nspecified that those DACA recipients whose benefits were \nset to expire within six months were eligible for two-year \nrenewals.  Ibid. \n  But Duke did not appear to appreciate the full scope of \nher discretion, which picked up where the Attorney Gen-\neral’s legal reasoning left off.  The Attorney General con-\ncluded that “the DACA policy has the same legal . . . defects \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  App. 878.  So, to \nunderstand those defects, we look to the Fifth Circuit, the  \nhighest court to offer a reasoned opinion on the legality \nof DAPA.  That court described the “core” issue before it as \nthe “Secretary’s decision” to grant “eligibility for benefits”—\nincluding  work  authorization,  Social  Security,  and \nMedicare—to unauthorized aliens on “a class-wide basis.”   \nTexas, 809  F. 3d, at 170; see id., at 148, 184. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit’s focus on these benefits was central to every stage of \nits analysis.  See id., at 155 (standing); id., at 163 (zone of\ninterest); id., at 164 (applicability of §1252(g));  id., at 166 \n(reviewability); id., at 176–177 (notice and comment); id., at  \n184 (substantive APA).  And the Court ultimately held that \nDAPA was “manifestly contrary to  the INA” precisely be-\ncause it “would make 4.3 million otherwise removable al-\niens” eligible for work authorization and public benefits.  \nId., at 181–182 (internal quotation marks omitted).5  \n—————— \n5As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social  \n \n \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  But there is more to DAPA (and DACA) than such bene-\nfits.  The defining feature of deferred action is the decision \nto defer removal (and to notify the affected alien of that de-\ncision). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a.  And the Fifth Circuit  \nwas careful to distinguish that forbearance component from \neligibility for benefits. As it explained, the “challenged por-\ntion of DAPA’s deferred-action program” was the decision \nto make DAPA recipients eligible for benefits.  See Texas, \n809 F. 3d, at 168, and n. 108.  The other “[p]art of DAPA,” \nthe court noted, “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at \nleast temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as \nto a class of what he deem[ed] to be low-priority illegal al-\niens.”  Id., at 166.  Borrowing from this Court’s prior de-\nscription of deferred action, the Fifth Circuit observed that \n“the states do not challenge the Secretary’s decision to ‘de-\ncline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or de-\ncline to execute a final order of deportation.’”  Id., at 168 \n \n(quoting Reno, 525 U. S., at 484).  And the Fifth Circuit un-\nderscored that nothing in its decision or the preliminary in-\njunction “requires the Secretary  to remove any alien or to\nalter” the Secretary’s class-based “enforcement priorities.”   \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 166, 169.  In other words, the Secre-\ntary’s forbearance authority was unimpaired. \n  Acting Secretary Duke recognized that the Fifth Circuit’s \nholding addressed the benefits associated with DAPA.  In  \nher memorandum she explained that the Fifth Circuit con-\n—————— \nSecurity and Medicare benefits because they had been designated “law-\nfully present.” Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 168.  Lawful presence is a statutory  \nprerequisite for receipt of  certain benefits.  See id., at 148 (citing 8  \nU. S. C. §1611).  It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexo-\nrably from forbearance.  Thus, while deferred action recipients have been \ndesignated lawfully present for purposes of Social Security and Medicare \neligibility, see 8 CFR §1.3; 42 CFR §417.422(h), agencies can also exclude \nthem from this designation, see 45 CFR §152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that \nDACA recipients are not considered lawfully present for purposes of cov-\nerage under the Affordable Care Act). \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncluded that DAPA “conflicted with the discretion author-\nized by Congress” because the INA “‘flatly does not permit \n \nthe reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully\npresent and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of \nfederal and state benefits, including work authorization.’”  \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 114a (quoting Texas, 809 F. 3d, at  \n184).  Duke did not characterize the opinion as one about \nforbearance. \n  In short, the Attorney General neither addressed the for-\nbearance policy at the heart of DACA nor compelled DHS \nto abandon that policy.  Thus, removing benefits eligibility \nwhile continuing forbearance remained squarely within the \ndiscretion of Acting Secretary Duke, who was responsible \nfor “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement poli-\ncies and priorities.” 116 Stat. 2178, 6 U. S. C. §202(5).  But \nDuke’s memo offers no reason  for terminating forbearance.  \nShe instead treated the Attorney General’s conclusion re-\ngarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both \nbenefits and forbearance, without explanation. \n  That reasoning repeated the error we identified in one of \nour leading modern administrative law cases, Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.  There, the Na-\ntional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) \npromulgated a requirement that motor vehicles produced \nafter 1982 be equipped with one of two passive restraints: \nairbags or automatic seatbelts.  463 U. S., at 37–38, 46.  \nFour years later, before the requirement went into effect, \nNHTSA concluded that automatic seatbelts, the restraint of  \nchoice for most manufacturers, would not provide effective \nprotection.  Based on that premise, NHTSA rescinded the \npassive restraint requirement in full.  Id., at 38. \n  We concluded that the total rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As we explained, NHTSA’s justification sup-\nported only “disallow[ing] compliance by means of ” auto-\n \nmatic seatbelts.  Id., at 47.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n“efficacy  of  airbag  technology”  or  upon  “the  need  for  a \npassive restraint standard.”  Ibid.  Given NHTSA’s prior \njudgment that “airbags are an effective and cost-beneficial \nlifesaving  technology,”  we  held  that  “the  mandatory\npassive restraint rule [could] not be abandoned without any \nconsideration whatsoever of an airbags-only requirement.”  \nId., at 51. \n  While the factual setting is different here, the error is the \nsame.  Even if it is illegal for DHS to extend work authori-\nzation and other benefits to DACA recipients, that conclu-\nsion supported only “disallow[ing]” benefits.  Id., at 47.  It \ndid “not cast doubt” on the legality of forbearance or upon \nDHS’s original reasons for extending forbearance to child-\nhood arrivals.  Ibid.  Thus, given DHS’s earlier judgment \nthat  forbearance  is  “especially  justified”  for  “productive  \nyoung  people”  who  were  brought  here  as  children  \nand “know only this country as home,”  App. to Pet. for \nCert. 98a–99a, the DACA Memorandum could not be re-\nscinded in full “without any consideration whatsoever” of a \nforbearance-only policy, State Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.6  \n  The Government acknowledges that “[d]eferred action \ncoupled with the associated benefits are the two legs upon \nwhich the DACA policy stands.”  Reply Brief 21.  It insists, \nhowever, that “DHS was not required to consider whether \nDACA’s illegality could be addressed by separating” the \n—————— \n6The three-page memorandum that established DACA is devoted en-\n \ntirely to forbearance, save for one sentence directing USCIS  to “deter-\nmine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work authorization.”  App. \nto Pet. for Cert. 101a.  The benefits associated with DACA flow from a  \nseparate  regulation.  See  8  CFR  §1.3(a)(4)(vi);  see  also  42  CFR \n§417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR §1.3).  Thus, DHS could have ad-\ndressed the Attorney General’s determination that such benefits were \nimpermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR §1.3 to exclude DACA \nrecipients from those benefits without rescinding the DACA Memoran-\ndum and the  forbearance policy it established.  But Duke’s rescission  \nmemo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo.  Ibid.   According to the Government, “It was not arbi-\ntrary and capricious for DHS to view deferred action and its \ncollateral benefits as importantly linked.”  Ibid.  Perhaps.  \nBut that response misses the point. The fact that there may \nbe a valid reason not to separate deferred action from ben-\nefits does not establish that DHS considered that option or \nthat such consideration was unnecessary. \n  The lead dissent acknowledges that forbearance and ben-\nefits are legally distinct and can be decoupled.  Post, at 21– \n22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J). It contends, however, that \nwe should not “dissect” agency action “piece by piece.”  Post,  \nat 21.  The dissent instead rests on the Attorney General’s\nlegal determination—which considered only benefits—“to \nsupply the ‘reasoned analysis’” to support rescission of both \n \nbenefits and forbearance.  Post, at 22 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U. S., at 42).  But State Farm teaches that when an  \nagency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the “alternative[s]” that are “within the ambit of \nthe existing [policy].”  Id., at 51.  Here forbearance was not \nsimply “within the ambit of the existing [policy],” it was the \ncenterpiece of the policy: DACA, after all, stands for “De-\nferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n111a (emphasis added).  But the rescission memorandum  \ncontains no discussion of forbearance or the option of retain-\ning forbearance without benefits.  Duke “entirely failed to \nconsider [that] important aspect of the problem.”  State \nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43.  \n  That omission alone renders Acting  Secretary Duke’s de-\ncision arbitrary and capricious.  But it is not the only defect.   \nDuke also failed to address whether there was “legitimate \nreliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  Smiley v. Citibank  \n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996).  When  an \nagency changes course, as DHS did here, it must “be cogni-\nzant that longstanding policies may have ‘engendered seri-\nous reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” \n \nEncino Motorcars, LLC  v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) \n \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n(slip op., at 9) (quoting Fox Television, 556 U. S., at 515).  “It \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”   \nId., at 515.  Yet that is what the Duke Memorandum did. \n  For its part, the Government does not contend that Duke \nconsidered potential reliance interests; it counters that she \ndid not need to.  In the Government’s view, shared by the \nlead dissent, DACA recipients have no “legally cognizable \nreliance interests” because the DACA Memorandum stated  \nthat the program “conferred no substantive rights” and pro-\nvided benefits only in two-year increments. Reply Brief 16–\n17; App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a. See also post, at 23–24 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J). But neither the Government nor the lead  \ndissent cites any legal authority establishing that such fea-\ntures automatically preclude reliance interests, and we are \nnot aware of any. These disclaimers are surely pertinent in \nconsidering the strength of any reliance interests, but that\nconsideration must be undertaken by the agency in the first \ninstance, subject to normal APA review.  There was no such  \nconsideration in the Duke Memorandum. \n  Respondents and their amici assert that there was much \nfor DHS to consider.  They stress that, since 2012, DACA\nrecipients have “enrolled in degree programs, embarked on \ncareers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even  \nmarried and had children, all in reliance” on the DACA pro-\ngram.  Brief for Respondent Regents of Univ. of California \net al. in No. 18–587, p.  41 (Brief for Regents).  The conse-\nquences of the rescission, respondents emphasize, would \n“radiate outward” to DACA recipients’ families, including \ntheir 200,000 U. S.-citizen children, to the schools where \nDACA recipients study and teach, and to the employers who\nhave invested time and money in training them. See id., at \n41–42; Brief for Respondent State of New York et al. in No. \n18–589, p. 42 (Brief for New York).  See also Brief for 143 \nBusinesses as Amici Curiae 17 (estimating that hiring and\ntraining replacements would cost employers $6.3 billion).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIn addition, excluding DACA recipients from the lawful la-\nbor force may, they tell us, result in the loss of $215 billion \nin economic activity and an associated $60 billion in federal \ntax revenue over the next ten years.  Brief for Regents 6.  \nMeanwhile, States and local governments could lose $1.25 \nbillion in tax revenue each year.  Ibid.  \n  These are certainly noteworthy concerns, but they are not \nnecessarily dispositive.  To the Government and lead dis-\nsent’s point, DHS could respond that reliance on forbear-\nance and benefits was unjustified in light of the express lim-\nitations in the DACA Memorandum.  Or it might conclude \nthat reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful \nare entitled to no or diminished weight.  And, even if DHS \nultimately concludes that the reliance interests rank as se-\nrious, they are but one factor to consider.  DHS may deter-\nmine, in the particular context before it, that other interests \nand policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests.  Mak-\ning that difficult decision was the agency’s  job, but the \nagency failed to do it.\n  DHS has considerable flexibility in carrying out its re-\nsponsibility.  The wind-down here is a good example of the \nkind of options available.  Acting Secretary Duke author-\nized DHS to process two-year renewals for those DACA re-\ncipients  whose  benefits  were  set  to  expire  within  six \nmonths.  But Duke’s consideration was solely for the pur-\npose of assisting the agency in dealing with “administrative \ncomplexities.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a–118a.  She should \nhave considered whether she had similar flexibility in ad-\ndressing any reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nlead dissent contends that accommodating such interests \nwould be “another exercise of unlawful power,” post, at 23 \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the Government does not make\nthat argument and DHS has already extended benefits for \npurposes other than reliance, following consultation with \nthe Office of the Attorney General.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n116a. \n \n\n26   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Had Duke considered reliance interests, she might, for \nexample, have considered a broader renewal period based\non the need for DACA recipients to reorder their affairs.  Al-\nternatively, Duke might have considered more accommo-\ndating termination dates for recipients caught in the mid-\ndle of a time-bounded commitment, to allow them to, say, \ngraduate from their course of study, complete their military \nservice, or finish a medical treatment regimen.  Or she  \nmight have instructed immigration officials to give salient \nweight to any reliance interests engendered by DACA when \nexercising individualized enforcement discretion.\n  To be clear, DHS was not required to do any of this or to \n“consider all policy alternatives in reaching [its] decision.”  \nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.  Agencies are not compelled to\nexplore “every alternative device and thought conceivable \nby the mind of man.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, \n551 (1978).  But, because DHS was “not writing on a blank \nslate,” post, at 22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), it was re-\nquired to assess whether there were reliance interests, de-\ntermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.\n  The lead dissent sees all the foregoing differently.  In its \nview, DACA is illegal, so any actions under DACA are them-\nselves illegal.  Such actions, it argues, must cease immedi-\nately and the APA should not be construed to impede that \nresult.  See post, at 19–23 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  The dissent is correct that DACA was rescinded because \nof  the  Attorney  General’s  illegality  determination.    See  \nante, at 20.  But nothing about that determination fore-\nclosed or even addressed the options of retaining forbear-\nance or accommodating particular reliance interests.  Act-\ning Secretary Duke should have considered those matters \nbut did not.  That failure was arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  27  \n \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nIV \n  Lastly, we turn to respondents’ claim that the rescis-\nsion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n  The parties dispute the proper framing of this claim.  The  \nGovernment contends that the allegation that the Execu-\ntive, motivated by animus, ended a program that dispropor-\ntionately benefits certain ethnic groups is a selective en-\nforcement claim.  Such a claim, the Government asserts,  \nis barred by our decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee.  See 525 U. S., at 488 (holding \nthat “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitu-\ntional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation”).  Respondents counter that their \nclaim falls outside the scope of that precedent because they \nare not challenging individual enforcement proceedings.  \nWe need not resolve this debate because, even if the claim \nis cognizable, the allegations here are insufficient. \n  To plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible infer-\nence that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a moti-\nvating factor” in the relevant decision.  Arlington Heights v.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, \n266 (1977). Possible evidence includes disparate impact on \na particular group, “[d]epartures from the normal proce-\ndural sequence,” and “contemporary statements by mem-\nbers of the decisionmaking body.”  Id., at 266–268.  Track-\ning  these  factors,  respondents  allege  that  animus  is\nevidenced by (1) the disparate impact of the rescission on \nLatinos from Mexico, who represent 78% of DACA recipi-\nents; (2) the unusual history behind the rescission; and \n(3) pre- and post-election statements by President Trump.  \nBrief for New York 54–55. \n  None of these points, either singly or in concert, estab-\nlishes a plausible equal protection claim.  First, because \nLatinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien\npopulation, one would expect them to make up an outsized \n \n\n28   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nshare of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief  \nprogram. See B. Baker, DHS, Office of Immigration Statis-\ntics,  Population  Estimates,  Illegal  Alien  Population \nResiding in the United States: January 2015, Table 2 (Dec. \n2018),  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\n18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf.  Were this fact suffi-\ncient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable im-\nmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection \ngrounds. \n  Second, there is nothing irregular about the history lead-\ning up to the September 2017 rescission.  The lower courts  \nconcluded that “DACA received reaffirmation by [DHS] as \nrecently as three months before the rescission,” 908 F. 3d, \nat 519 (quoting 298 F. Supp. 3d, at 1315), referring to the \nJune 2017 DAPA rescission memo, which stated that DACA \nwould “remain in effect,” App. 870.  But this reasoning con-\nfuses abstention with reaffirmation.  The DAPA memo did \nnot address the merits of the DACA policy or its legality.  \nThus, when the Attorney General later determined that \nDACA  shared  DAPA’s  legal  defects,  DHS’s  decision  to  \nreevaluate DACA was not a “strange about-face.”  908 F. 3d,  \nat 519.  It was a natural response to a newly identified \nproblem.\n  Finally, the cited statements are unilluminating.  The  \nrelevant actors were most directly Acting Secretary Duke \nand the Attorney General.  As the Batalla Vidal court  \nacknowledged, respondents did not “identif[y] statements\nby [either] that would give rise to an inference of discrimi-\nnatory motive.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 278. Instead, respond-\nents contend that President Trump made critical state-\nments  about  Latinos  that  evince  discriminatory  intent.  \nBut,  even  as  interpreted  by  respondents,  these  state-\nments—remote in time and made in unrelated contexts— \ndo not qualify as “contemporary statements” probative of \nthe decision at issue.  Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 268.   \nThus, like respondents’ other points, the statements fail to \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nraise a plausible inference that the rescission was moti-\nvated by animus. \n*  *  * \n  We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are \nsound policies.  “The wisdom” of those decisions “is none of \nour concern.”  Chenery  II, 332 U. S., at 207.  We address \nonly whether the agency complied with the procedural re-\nquirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its ac-\ntion. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous is-\nsues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything \nto do about the hardship to DACA recipients.  That dual  \nfailure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated \nthe scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a \nreasonable manner.  The appropriate recourse is therefore \nto remand to DHS so that it may consider the problem  \nanew. \n  The judgment in NAACP, No. 18–588, is affirmed.7  The  \njudgment in Regents, No. 18–587, is vacated in part and re-\nversed in part.  And in Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589, the Feb-\nruary 13, 2018 order granting respondents’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction is vacated, the November 9, 2017 or-\nder partially denying the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis affirmed in part, and the March  29, 2018 order partially \ndenying the balance of the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis reversed in part. All three cases are remanded for further  \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n—————— \n7Our affirmance of the  NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it \n \nunnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope of the in-\njunctions issued by the District Courts in  Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \n  The majority rightly holds that the Department of Home-\nland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri-\nvals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any chal-\nlenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  \nI believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing \nrecord and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would \ninstead permit respondents to develop their equal protec-\ntion claims on remand. \n  Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in  a \npreliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at \nthis stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that \nwould “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that \n[a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,  678 (2009).  The three courts to eval-\nuate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared \nthis modest threshold.  908 F. 3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) \n(affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018). \n  I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on re-\nmand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts \nthat plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality \ndisagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either sin-\ngly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection \nclaim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by dis-\ncounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly view-\ning the rest.\n  First, the plurality dismisses the statements that Presi-\ndent Trump made both  before and after he assumed office.  \nThe  Batalla  Vidal  complaints  catalog  then-candidate \nTrump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people \nthat have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, \ndrug dealers, [and] rapists.” 291 F.  Supp. 3d, at 276 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints ad-\n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nditionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement compar-\ning undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for \n“the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling \nand trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 \n(ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nplurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote \nin time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  \nAnte, at 28.  \n  But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered \napproach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements \nas remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Ha-\nwaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements \narise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migra-\ntion from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s cam-\npaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, ac-\ncording to respondents, were an animating force behind the \nrescission of DACA. Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proc-\nlamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred \nentry of individuals from several Muslim-majority coun-\ntries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign state-\nments about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the \nPresident” help to “create the strong perception” that the \nrescission  decision  was  “contaminated  by  impermissible \ndiscriminatory  animus.”  585  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of  \nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides\nrespondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection \nclaims further. \n  Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate im-\npact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering \nthis point in isolation. Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient \nto state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immi-\ngration  policy  could  be  challenged  on  equal  protection\ngrounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be \nviewed in the context of the President’s public statements \non and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nstage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an \nexecutive decision disproportionately harms the same ra-\ncial group that the President branded as less desirable mere \nmonths earlier. \n  Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “spe-\ncific sequence of events leading up to the challenged deci-\nsion.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late  \nas  June  2017,  DHS  insisted  it  remained  committed  to \nDACA, even while rescinding a related program, the De-\nferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Perma-\nnent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months  \nlater,  DHS  terminated  DACA  without,  as  the  plurality \nacknowledges, considering important aspects of the termi-\nnation.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests \nthat something other than questions about the legality of \nDACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it \nraises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the \ndecision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Depart-\nment of Commerce  v.  New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) \n(slip op., at 26).  Only by bypassing context does the plural-\nity conclude otherwise. \n*  *  * \n  The facts in respondents’ complaints create more than a\n“sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  \nIqbal, 556 U. S., at 678.  Whether they ultimately amount \nto actionable discrimination should be determined only af-\nter factual development on remand.  Because the Court  \nprematurely  disposes  of  respondents’  equal  protection \nclaims by overlooking the strength of their complaints, I \njoin all but Part IV of the opinion and do not concur in the \ncorresponding part of the judgment. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Between 2001 and 2011, Congress considered over two \ndozen bills that would have granted lawful status to mil-\nlions of aliens who were illegally brought to this country as \nchildren.  Each of those legislative efforts failed.  In the \nwake of this impasse, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (DHS) under President Barack Obama took matters  \ninto its own hands.  Without any purported delegation of \nauthority from Congress and without undertaking a rule-\nmaking, DHS unilaterally created a program known as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  The three-\npage DACA memorandum made it possible for approxi-\nmately 1.7 million illegal aliens to qualify for temporary \nlawful  presence  and  certain  federal  and  state  benefits.  \nWhen President Donald Trump took office in  2017, his Act-\ning Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through yet an-\nother memorandum, rescinded the DACA memorandum.  \nTo state it plainly, the Trump administration rescinded \nDACA the same way that the Obama administration cre-\nated it: unilaterally, and through a mere memorandum. \n  Today the majority makes the mystifying determination \nthat this rescission of DACA was unlawful.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the majority acts as though it is engaging \nin the routine application of standard principles of admin-\nistrative law. On the contrary, this is anything but a stand-\nard administrative law case. \n  DHS created DACA during the Obama administration \nwithout  any  statutory  authorization  and  without  going \nthrough the requisite rulemaking process.  As a result, the  \nprogram was unlawful from its inception.  The majority \ndoes not even attempt to explain why a court has the au-\nthority to scrutinize an agency’s policy reasons for rescind-\ning an unlawful program under the arbitrary and capri-\ncious microscope. The decision to countermand an unlawful \nagency action is clearly reasonable.

The Court could have made clear that the solution  \nrespondents seek must come from the Legislative Branch.  \nInstead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS’ initial \noverreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.  In \ndoing so, it has given the green light for future political bat-\ntles to be fought in this Court rather than where they right-\nfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes \nthe Court’s duty to apply the law according to neutral prin-\nciples, and the ripple effects of the majority’s error will be \nfelt throughout our system of self-government. \n  Perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority’s holding \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing ad-\nministrations.  Under the auspices of today’s decision, ad-\nministrations  can  bind  their  successors  by  unlawfully \nadopting  significant  legal  changes  through  Executive \nBranch agency memoranda.  Even if the agency lacked au-\nthority to effectuate the changes, the changes cannot be un-\ndone by the same agency in a successor administration un-\nless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications to \nthe satisfaction of this Court.  In other words, the majority \nerroneously holds that the agency is not only permitted, but \nrequired,  to  continue  administering  unlawful  programs \nthat it inherited from a previous administration.

In the \nSecretary’s view, the program was consistent with “the \nframework  of the existing law.”  Id., at 101a. \n  DACA granted a renewable 2-year period of “deferred ac-\ntion” that made approximately 1.7 million otherwise remov-\nable aliens eligible to remain in this country temporarily.3   \nBy granting deferred action, the memorandum also made \nrecipients eligible for certain state and federal benefits, in-\ncluding  Medicare  and  Social  Security.

Despite  these \nchanges, the memorandum contradictorily claimed that it \n“confer[red] no substantive right [or] immigration status,” \nbecause “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 18–587, at 101a. \n  In 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh John-\nson broadened the deferred-action program in yet another \nbrief memorandum.  This 2014 memorandum expanded\nDACA eligibility by extending the deferred-action period to \nthree years and by relaxing other criteria.  It also imple-\nmented a related program, known as Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  DAPA allowed unlawfully present parents to ob-\ntain deferred action derivatively through their children who \nwere either citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Ap-\nproximately 4.3 million aliens qualified for DAPA and, as \nwith DACA, these individuals would have become eligible \nfor certain federal and state benefits upon the approval of \ntheir DAPA applications.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF. 3d 134, 181 (CA5 2015).  Nevertheless, the 2014 memo-\nrandum repeated the incongruous assertion that these pro-\ngrams “d[id] not confer any form of legal status in this coun-\ntry” and added that deferred action “may be terminated at \nany time at the agency’s discretion.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. \nin No. 18–587, at 104a. \nB \n  Twenty-six States filed suit to enjoin the implementation \nof  these  new  programs,  DAPA  and  “expanded  DACA,” \nmaintaining that they violated the Constitution, the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA).  The States contended that, \nbecause the 2014 memorandum allowed aliens to receive \ndeferred action and other benefits, it amounted to a legisla-\ntive rule that had to comply with the APA’s notice  and \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The States also argued that DHS’ de-\ncision to recategorize an entire class of aliens from “unlaw-\nfully present” to “lawfully present” exceeded its statutory \nauthority under the federal immigration laws.  According \nto the States, these defects rendered the 2014 memoran-\ndum arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.  \n  The District Court preliminarily enjoined DAPA and ex-\npanded DACA.  The Fifth Circuit  affirmed, rejecting DHS’ \nclaim that the programs were an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion.  Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 167, 188.  The court con-\ncluded that the States were likely to succeed on their claim \nthat the 2014 memorandum was a legislative rule that had \nto be adopted through notice and comment rulemaking.  Id., \nat 171–178.  The court further concluded that the 2014  \nmemorandum was “substantively contrary to law” because\nthe INA did not grant DHS the statutory authority to im-\nplement either program.  Id., at 170, 178–186. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 579 U. S. ___ \n(2016) (per curiam).  \nC \n  The 2014 memorandum was rescinded on June 15, 2017, \nbefore taking effect.  Shortly after that rescission, several \nof the plaintiff States sent a letter to then-Attorney General \nJefferson Sessions III. They contended that the 2012 DACA \nmemorandum was also legally defective because, “just like \nDAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for . . . lawful \npresence without any statutory authorization from Con-\ngress.” App. 873.  The States wrote that they would amend \ntheir complaint to challenge DACA if the administration \ndid not rescind the 2012 memorandum creating DACA by \nSeptember 5, 2017.\n  On September 4, then-Attorney General Sessions wrote \nto  then-Acting  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Elaine  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nDuke, advising her to rescind DACA.  Sessions stated that, \nin his legal opinion, DACA took effect “through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no es-\ntablished end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a simi-\nlar result.  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigra-\ntion laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by \nthe Executive Branch.”  Id., at 877.  The letter also stated \nthat DACA was infected with the “same legal . . . defects  \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA,” id., at  878, and thus \nDACA would likely be enjoined as well. \n  Then-Acting Secretary Duke  rescinded DACA the next \nday, also through a memorandum.  Her memorandum be-\ngan by noting that DACA “purported to use deferred action \n. . . to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress \nhad not otherwise acted to provide by law.” App. to Pet. for  \nCert. in No. 18–587, at 112a.  It described the history of the\nFifth Circuit litigation, noting that the court had concluded \nthat DAPA “conflicted with the discretion authorized by  \nCongress”  because  “the [INA] flatly does not permit the  \nreclassification  of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully pre-\nsent.”  Id., at 114a (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fi-\nnally, the memorandum accepted then-Attorney General \nSessions’ legal determination that DACA was unlawful for \nthe same reasons as DAPA.  See §1103(a)(1). In light of the\nlegal conclusions reached by the Fifth Circuit and the At-\ntorney General, then-Acting Secretary Duke set forth the \nprocedures for winding down DACA. \n  These three cases soon followed.  In each, respondents\nclaimed, among other things, that DACA’s rescission was \narbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  APA.    Two  District  \nCourts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while \nthe third vacated the rescission. \nII \n  “‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nuntil Congress confers power upon it.’”  Arlington v. FCC, \n \n569 U. S. 290, 317 (2013) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quot-\ning Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355,  \n374 (1986)).  When an  agency exercises power beyond the\nbounds of its authority, it acts unlawfully.  See, e.g., SAS  \nInstitute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___, ___, n. (2018) (slip op., \nat 11, n.).  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA provides \na poignant illustration of ultra vires agency action.\n  DACA alters how the immigration laws apply to a certain \nclass of aliens.  “DACA [recipients] primarily entered the \ncountry either by overstaying a visa or by entering without \ninspection, and the INA instructs that aliens in both classes \nare removable.”  Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662, 713 (SD Tex. 2018) (footnote omitted).  But DACA \ngranted its recipients deferred action, i.e., a decision to “de-\ncline  to  institute  [removal]  proceedings,  terminate  [re-\nmoval] proceedings, or decline to institute a final order of \n[removal].”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  \nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Under other regulations, recipients of deferred \naction are deemed lawfully present for purposes of certain \nfederal benefits. See supra, at 4. Thus, DACA in effect cre-\nated a new exception to the statutory provisions governing \nremovability and, in the process, conferred lawful presence \non an entire class of aliens.  \n  To  lawfully  implement  such  changes,  DHS  needed  a \ngrant of authority from Congress to either reclassify remov-\nable DACA recipients as lawfully present, or to exempt the \nentire class of aliens covered by DACA from statutory re-\nmoval procedures. No party disputes that the immigration \nstatutes lack an express delegation to accomplish either re-\nsult.  And, an examination of the highly reticulated immi-\ngration regime makes clear that DHS has no implicit dis-\ncretion to create new classes of lawful presence or to grant \nrelief from  removal out of whole cloth.  Accordingly, DACA  \nis substantively unlawful. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  This conclusion should begin and  end our review.  The  \ndecision to rescind an unlawful agency action is per se law-\nful. No additional policy justifications or considerations are  \nnecessary.  And, the majority’s contrary holding—that an \nagency is not only permitted, but required, to continue an  \nultra vires action—has no basis in  law. \nA \n  Congress has not authorized DHS to reclassify an entire \nclass of removable aliens as lawfully present or to categori-\ncally exempt aliens from statutory removal provisions.  \n1 \n  I begin with lawful presence.  As just stated, nothing in \nthe federal immigration laws expressly delegates to DHS\nthe unfettered discretion to create new categories of law-\nfully present aliens.  And, there is no basis for concluding \nthat Congress implicitly delegated to DHS the power to re-\nclassify categories of aliens as lawfully present.  The immi-\ngration statutes provide numerous ways to obtain lawful \npresence, both temporary and permanent.  The highly de-\ntailed nature of these provisions indicates that Congress \nhas exhaustively provided for all of  the ways that it thought \nlawful presence should be obtainable, leaving no discretion \nto DHS to add new pathways. \n  For example, federal immigration laws provide over 60\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa options, including visas for \nambassadors, full-time students and their spouses and chil-\ndren, those engaged to marry a United States citizen within \n90 days of arrival, athletes and performers, and aliens with \nspecialized  knowledge  related  to  their  employers.    See  \n§§1101(a)(15)(A)–(V), 1184; 8 CFR §214.1; see also Congres-\nsional Research Service, J. Wilson, Nonimmigrant and Im-\nmigrant Visa Categories: Data Brief 1–6 (2019) (Table 1).  \nIn addition, the statutes permit the Attorney General to \ngrant temporary “parole” into the  United States “for urgent \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nhumanitarian reasons or [a] significant public benefit,” 8 \nU. S. C.  §1182(d)(5)(A);  provide  for  temporary  protected \nstatus when the Attorney General finds that removal to a\ncountry with an ongoing armed conflict “would pose a seri-\nous threat to [an alien’s] personal safety,” §1254a(b)(1)(A); \nand allow the Secretary of Homeland Security (in consulta-\ntion with the Secretary  of State) to waive visa requirements \nfor certain aliens for up to 90 days, §§1187(a)–(d). \n  The immigration laws are equally complex and detailed \nwhen it comes to obtaining lawful permanent residence.  \nCongress  has  expressly  specified  numerous  avenues  for  \nobtaining an immigrant visa, which aliens  may then use  \nto become lawful permanent residents.  §§1201, 1255(a).   \nAmong  other  categories, immigrant visas are available to \nspecified  family-sponsored aliens, aliens with advanced de-\ngrees or exceptional abilities, certain types of skilled and \nunskilled workers, “special immigrants,” and those enter-\ning the country to “engag[e] in a new commercial enter-\nprise.”  §§1153(a)–(b),  1154;  see  also  Congressional  Re-\nsearch  Service,  Nonimmigrant  and  Immigrant  Visa \nCategories, at 6–7 (Table 2).  Refugees and asylees also may \nreceive lawful permanent residence under certain condi-\ntions, §1159; 8 CFR §§209.1, 209.2.4  As with  temporary  \nlawful presence,  each  avenue to lawful  permanent resi-\ndence status has its own set of rules and exceptions.5  \n  As the Fifth Circuit held in the DAPA litigation, a conclu-\nsion with which then-Attorney General Sessions agreed, \n“specific and detailed provisions[ of] the INA expressly and \n—————— \n4The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful perma-\n \nnent residence status.  See §1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) (two years for spouses to \ndemonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of \nprocuring an  alien’s admission as an immigrant”); §1186b (qualifying  \nbusiness entrepreneurs). \n5For instance, Congress has  carved out rules for aliens who served in \n \nthe Armed Forces, §§1438–1440, and alien spouses who have been sub-\nject to domestic abuse, §§1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In light of this elaborate statutory scheme, the lack of \nany similar provision for DACA recipients convincingly es-\ntablishes that Congress left DHS with no discretion to cre-\nate an additional class of aliens eligible for lawful presence.  \nCongress knows well how to provide broad discretion, and\nit has provided open-ended delegations of authority in stat-\nutes too numerous to name.  But when it comes to lawful \npresence, Congress did something strikingly different.  In-\nstead of enacting  a statute with “broad general directives” \nand leaving it to the agency to fill in the lion’s share of the \ndetails,  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.  S.  361,  372 \n(1989), Congress put in place intricate specifications gov-\nerning eligibility for lawful presence.  This comprehensive \nscheme indicates that DHS has no discretion to supplement \nor amend the statutory provisions in any manner, least of \nall by memorandum.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (An agency “may not \nexercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with \nthe administrative structure that Congress enacted” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); see also ETSI Pipeline Pro-\nject v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 509–510 (1988). \n2 \n  The relief that Congress has extended to removable al-\niens likewise confirms that DACA exceeds DHS’ delegated \nauthority.  Through deferred action, DACA grants tempo-\nrary relief to removable aliens on a programmatic scale.  \nSee Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d, at 714.  But as with lawful pres-\nence, Congress did not expressly grant DHS the authority \nto create categorical exceptions to the statute’s removal re-\nquirements.  And again, as with lawful presence, the intri-\ncate level of detail in the federal immigration laws regard-\ning  relief  from  removal  indicates  that  DHS  has  no  \ndiscretionary authority to supplement that relief with an  \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nentirely new programmatic exemption.\n  At the outset, Congress clearly knows how to provide for \nclasswide deferred action when it wishes to do so.  On mul-\ntiple  occasions,  Congress  has  used  express  language  to \nmake certain classes of individuals eligible for deferred ac-\ntion. See 8 U. S. C. §§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (certain indi-\nviduals covered under the Violence Against Women Act are \n“eligible for deferred action”); Victims of Trafficking and Vi-\nolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522 (“‘Any individ-\n \nual described in subclause (I) is  eligible for deferred ac-\ntion’”); Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Ter-\nrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, §423(b), 115 Stat. \n361 (“Such  spouse, child, son, or daughter may be eligible \nfor deferred action”); National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, §§1703(c)(1)(A), (2), 117 Stat. 1694–\n1695 (“Such spouse or child shall be eligible for deferred ac-\ntion”).6  Congress has failed to provide similar explicit pro-\nvisions for DACA recipients, and the immigration laws con-\ntain no indication that DHS can, at will, create its own \ncategorical policies for deferred action. \n  Other provisions pertaining to relief from removal fur-\nther demonstrate that DHS lacked the delegated authority  \n—————— \n6In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action pro-\n \ngrams have been implemented by the Executive Branch without explicit \nlegislation.  But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive]  \n \npower.’ ” Medellín v.  Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 532 (2008) (quoting  Dames & \n \nMoore v.  Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981)).  If any of these programs had \nbeen challenged, it would seem that they would be legally infirm for the  \nsame reasons as DACA.  Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create \nnew categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ \ndeferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise.   Duncan v.  \nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, \nand Congress is no closer to a legislative solution than it was in 2012.   \nSee, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H. R. 6, 116th Cong., \n1st Sess.  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nto create DACA.  As with lawful presence, Congress has \nprovided a plethora of methods by which aliens may seek \nrelief from removal.  For instance, both permanent and \ntemporary residents can seek cancellation of removal if  \nthey meet certain residency requirements and have not \ncommitted certain crimes.  §§1229b(a)–(b).  And certain \nnonpermanent residents may have their status adjusted to \npermanent  residence  during  these  proceedings.  \n§1229b(b)(2). Aliens can apply for asylum or withholding of \nremoval during removal proceedings unless they have com-\nmitted certain crimes.  §§1158, 1231(b)(3).  Applicants for \ncertain nonimmigrant visas may be granted a stay of re-\nmoval until the visa application is adjudicated.  §1227(d).  \nAnd, aliens may voluntarily depart rather than be subject\nto an order of removal. §1229c.\n  In sum, like lawful presence, Congress has provided for \nrelief from removal in specific and complex ways.  This nu-\nanced detail indicates that Congress has provided the full \npanoply of methods it thinks should be available for an al-\nien to seek relief from removal, leaving no discretion to DHS \nto provide additional programmatic forms of relief.7  \n3 \n  Finally, DHS could not appeal to general grants of au-\nthority, such as the Secretary’s ability to “perform such\nother acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his au-\nthority under the provisions of this chapter,” §1103(a)(3), or \nto “[e]stablis[h] national immigration enforcement policies\nand  priorities,”  6  U. S. C.  §202(5).    See  also  8  U. S. C.  \n§1103(g)(2).  Because we must interpret the statutes “as a \n—————— \n7It is uncontested that deferred action frequently occurs  on a case-by-\n \ncase basis, often justified on the grounds that the agency lacks resources  \nto remove all removable aliens.  Even assuming that these ad hoc exer-\ncises of discretion are permissible, however, we  have stated that “[a]n \nagency confronting resource  constraints may change its own conduct, but \nit cannot change the law.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.  EPA, 573 U. S.  \n302, 327 (2014). \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 561, 569 (1995), these grants of au-\nthority must be read alongside the express limits contained \nwithin the statute.  Basing the Secretary’s ability to com-\npletely overhaul immigration law on these general grants \nof  authority  would  eviscerate  that  deliberate  statutory \nscheme by “allow[ing the Secretary of DHS] to grant lawful  \npresence  . .  .  to  any  illegal  alien  in  the  United States.”  \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 184.  Not only is this “an untenable po-\nsition in light of the INA’s intricate system,” ibid., but it \nwould also render many of those provisions wholly super-\nfluous due to DHS’ authority to disregard them at will, \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  And in addi-\ntion to these fatal problems, adopting a broad interpreta-\ntion of these general grants of authority would run afoul of \nthe presumption that “Congress . . . does not alter the fun-\ndamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or \nancillary  provisions.”  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  \nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).

United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 654 (SD Tex.  \n2015). The immigration statutes contain a level of granular \nspecificity that is exceedingly rare in the modern adminis-\ntrative state.  It defies all logic and common sense to con-\nclude that a statutory scheme detailed enough to provide \nconditional lawful presence to groups as narrowly defined\nas “alien entrepreneurs,” §1186b, is simultaneously capa-\ncious enough for DHS to grant lawful presence to almost \ntwo million  illegal aliens with the stroke of a Cabinet secre-\ntary’s pen. \nB \n  Then-Attorney General Sessions concluded that the ini-\ntial DACA program suffered from the “same legal . . . de-\nfects” as DAPA and expanded DACA, finding that, like \nthose programs, DACA was implemented without statutory\nauthority. App. 877–878. Not only was this determination \ncorrect, but it is also dispositive for purposes of our review.  \n“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power . . .  \nis limited to the authority granted by Congress.”  Bowen v.  \nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988).  DHS \nhad no authority here to create DACA, and the unlawful-\nness of that program is a sufficient justification for its re-\nscission.  \n  The majority opts for a different path, all but ignoring \nDACA’s substantive legal defect.  See ante, at 18–19.  On \nthe majority’s understanding of APA review, DHS was re-\nquired to provide additional policy justifications in order to \nrescind an action that it had no authority to take.  This rule \n“has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for [it] is \nconspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.”  Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 536 (2007) (ROBERTS, C.

No court can compel Executive Branch officials to ex-\nceed their congressionally delegated powers by continuing \na program that was void ab initio. Cf. Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U.

Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 487 (1989) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  In reviewing agency\naction, our role is to ensure that Executive Branch officials  \ndo not transgress the proper bounds of their authority, Ar-\nlington, 569 U. S., at 327 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), not \nto perpetuate a decision to unlawfully wield power in direct \ncontravention  of  the enabling  statute’s  clear  limits,  see \nUARG, 573 U. S., at 327–328; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n  Under our precedents, DHS can only exercise the author-\nity that Congress has chosen to delegate to it.  See UARG, \n573 U. S., at 327.  In implementing DACA, DHS under the \nObama administration arrogated to itself power it was not \ngiven by Congress. Thus, every action taken by DHS under \nDACA is the unlawful exercise of power.  Now, under the  \nTrump administration, DHS has provided the most compel-\nling reason to rescind DACA: The program was unlawful \nand would force DHS to continue acting unlawfully if it car-\nried the program forward.  \nIII  \n  The majority’s demanding review of DHS’ decisionmak-\ning process is especially perverse given that the 2012 mem-\norandum flouted the APA’s procedural requirements—the\nvery  requirements  designed  to  prevent  arbitrary  deci-\nsionmaking. Even if DHS were authorized to create DACA,  \nit could not do so without undertaking an administrative \nrulemaking.  The fact that DHS did not engage in this pro-\ncess likely provides an independent basis for rescinding \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

But at the very least, this procedural defect com-\npounds the absurdity of the majority’s position in these \ncases. \n  As described above, DACA fundamentally altered the im-\nmigration laws. It created a new category of aliens who, as \na class, became exempt from statutory removal procedures, \nand it gave those aliens temporary lawful presence.  Both \nchanges contravened statutory limits.  DACA is thus what  \nis commonly called a substantive or legislative rule.8  As the  \nname implies, our precedents state that legislative rules \nare those that “have the force and effect of law.”  Chrysler  \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Our  precedents  allow  the  vast  majority  of  legislative \nrules to proceed through so-called “informal” notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  See United States v. Florida East \nCoast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973).9 But under our \nprecedents, an agency must engage in certain procedures \nmandated by the APA before its rule carries legal force.  Ki-\nsor v. Wilkie, 588 U.

These procedures specify that the \nagency “shall” publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in  \n—————— \n8The majority  tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must.  See ante, at \n \n11–12.  Otherwise, the majority would have to accept that DACA was \nnothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make \nits rescission  unreviewable.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831  \n(1985). \n9As I have previously pointed out, “the APA actually contemplated a  \n \nmuch more formal process  for most rulemaking.”   Perez v. Mortgage  \nBankers Assn., 575 U.

As we have recognized\nrecently, use of the word “shall” indicates that these proce-\ndures impose mandatory obligations on the agency before it \ncan adopt a valid binding regulation.  See Maine Commu-\nnity Health Options v.  United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___  \n(2020) (slip op., at 12).  After undergoing notice and com-\nment, the agency then publishes the final rule, which must \n“articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the] action in-\ncluding a rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United  \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463  \nU.

(slip op., at 17).10  \n  Because DACA has the force and effect of law, DHS was  \nrequired to observe the procedures set out in the APA if it \nwanted to promulgate a legislative rule.  It is undisputed, \nhowever, that DHS did not do so.  It provided no oppor-\ntunity for interested parties to submit comments regarding \nthe effect that the program’s dramatic and very significant \nchange in immigration law would have on various aspects \nof society.  It provided no discussion of economic considera-\ntions or national security interests.  Nor did it provide any \nsubstantial policy justifications for treating young people \n—————— \n10The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment \n \nrulemaking.  For example, an agency may promulgate a legally binding \nrule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so.  5 U.  S. C.  \n§553(b)(B).  This text would become a nullity if the agency  could achieve \nthe same effect by simply dispensing with notice and comment proce-\ndures altogether. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

And, it did not invoke any law authorizing  \nDHS to create such a program beyond its inexplicable as-\nsertion that DACA  was consistent with existing law.  Be-\ncause DHS failed to engage in the statutorily mandated\nprocess, DACA never gained status as a legally binding reg-\nulation that could impose duties or obligations on third par-\nties.  See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 23);  id., \nat ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17).\n  Given this state of affairs, it is unclear to me why DHS \nneeded to provide any explanation whatsoever when it de-\ncided to rescind DACA.  Nothing in the APA suggests that \nDHS was required to spill any ink justifying the rescission\nof an invalid legislative rule, let alone that it was required \nto provide policy justifications beyond acknowledging that \nthe program was simply unlawful from the beginning.  And,  \nit is well established that we do not remand for an agency \nto correct its reasoning when it was required by law to take \nor abstain from an action.  See Morgan Stanley Capital \nGroup Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 \nU. S. 527, 544–545 (2008).  Here, remand would be futile,  \nbecause no amount of policy explanation could cure the fact \nthat DHS lacked statutory authority to enact DACA in the \nfirst place.\n  Instead of recognizing this, the majority now requires the \nrescinding Department to treat the invalid rule as though \nit were legitimate.  As just explained, such a requirement \nis not supported by the APA.11  It is also absurd, as evi-\ndenced by its application to DACA in these cases.  The ma-\njority insists that DHS was obligated to discuss its choices \nregarding benefits and forbearance in great detail, even \n—————— \n11Thus, it is not  that the APA “should  not” be construed to support the \n \nmajority’s result, ante, at 26 (emphasis added), it is that the APA does  \nnot and cannot support that result. \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nthough no such detailed discussion accompanied DACA’s is-\nsuance. And, the majority also requires DHS to discuss re-\nliance interests at length, even though deferred action tra-\nditionally does not take reliance interests into account and \nDHS was not forced to explain its treatment of reliance in-\nterests in the first instance by going through notice and \ncomment.  See infra, at 23–24.  The majority’s demand for\nsuch an explanation here simply makes little sense. \n  At bottom, of course, none of this matters, because DHS  \ndid provide a sufficient explanation for its action.  DHS’ \nstatement that DACA was ultra vires  was more than suffi-\ncient to justify its rescission.12  By requiring more, the ma-\njority has distorted the APA review process beyond recogni-\ntion,  further  burdening  all  future  attempts  to  rescind \nunlawful programs.  Plaintiffs frequently bring successful \nchallenges to agency actions by arguing that the agency has \nimpermissibly dressed up a legislative rule as a policy state-\nment and must comply with the relevant procedures before \nfunctionally binding regulated parties.  See, e.g., Mendoza  \nv. Perez, 754 F. 3d 1002 (CADC 2014); Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 643 F. 3d 311 (CADC 2011); Na-\ntional Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn., Inc.  \nv. Sullivan, 979 F. 2d 227 (CADC 1992).  But going forward, \nwhen a rescinding agency inherits an invalid legislative\nrule that ignored virtually every rulemaking requirement \nof the APA, it will be obliged to overlook that reality.  In-\nstead of simply terminating the program because it did not \ngo through the requisite process, the agency will be com-\npelled to treat an invalid legislative rule as though it were \nlegitimate.13  \n—————— \n12I express no view on what other reasons would justify  an agency’s  \n \ndecision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action.  I merely point out \nthat correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n13In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immi-\n \ngration laws and had complied with the APA, it would still violate the \nConstitution as an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  See  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

The majority, therefore, claims that, notwith-\nstanding  the  then-Attorney  General’s  legal  conclusion, \nthen-Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider re-\nvoking  DACA  recipients’  lawful  presence  and  other  at-\ntendant benefits while continuing to defer their removal.  \nAnte, at 22–23. Even assuming the majority correctly char-\nacterizes the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, it cites no authority for \nthe proposition that arbitrary and capricious review re-\nquires an agency to dissect an unlawful program piece by \npiece,  scrutinizing  each  separate  element  to  determine \nwhether it would independently violate the law, rather \nthan just to rescind the entire program.14  \n—————— \nDepartment of Transportation v.  Association of American Railroads, 575  \nU. S. 43, 77 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).  Putting aside \nthis constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment process at \nleast attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some \nof the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rule-\nmaking process.  Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51  \nAdmin. L. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n14The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly \n \nquestionable.  Because a grant of deferred action renders DACA recipi-\nents eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from \nclear that the Department could separate  DACA’s “forbearance compo-\nnent” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet an-\nother APA problem.  The majority points to the fact that, under the Pa-\ntient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, relevant regulations \nexclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage.  \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  The then-Attorney General reviewed the thorough deci-\nsions of the District Court and the Fifth Circuit.  Those \ncourts exhaustively examined the INA’s text and structure, \nthe relevant provisions of other federal immigration stat-\nutes, the historical practice of deferred action, and the gen-\neral grants of statutory authority to set immigration policy.  \nBoth decisions concluded that  DAPA and expanded DACA \nviolated the carefully crafted federal immigration scheme, \nthat such violations could not be justified through reference \nto past exercises of deferred action, and that the general \ngrants of statutory authority did not give DHS the power to \nenact such a sweeping nonenforcement program. Based on  \nthe reasoning of those decisions, then-Attorney General \nSessions concluded that DACA was likewise implemented \nwithout statutory authority.  He directed DHS to restore \nthe rule of law.  DHS followed the then-Attorney General’s \nlegal analysis and rescinded the program.  This legal con-\nclusion more than suffices to supply the “reasoned analysis” \nnecessary to rescind an unlawful program. State Farm, 463  \nU. S., at 42.  \n  The majority has no answer except to suggest that this \napproach is inconsistent with  State Farm.  See ante, at 21– \n22.  But in doing so, the majority ignores the fact that, un-\nlike the typical “prior policy” contemplated by the Court in  \n—————— \nAnte, at 19, n. 5.  But that misses the point.  Those regulations were \npromulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the DACA pro-\ncess applie[d]” for those benefits.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012).  By \ncontrast, DACA recipients have been eligible for and have received Med-\nicare, Social Security, and work authorization for  years.  DHS therefore \nis not writing on a blank slate.  Under the majority’s rule, DHS would  \nneed to amend all relevant regulations and explain why all recipients of\ndeferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer \nreceive them.  Alternatively and perhaps  more problematically, it would \nneed to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred action should  \ncontinue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not.  It thus seems  \nhighly likely that the majority’s proposed course of action would be sub-\nject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nState Farm, DACA is unlawful.  Neither State Farm nor \nany other decision cited by the majority addresses what an \nagency must do when it has inherited an unlawful program.  \nIt is perhaps for this reason that, rather than responding \nwith authority of its own, the majority simply opts to excise \nthe “unlawful policy” aspect from its discussion. \nB \n  Second, the majority claims that DHS erred by failing to \ntake into account the reliance interests of DACA recipients.   \nAnte, at 23–26.  But reliance interests are irrelevant when  \nassessing whether to rescind an action that the agency \nlacked statutory authority to take.  No amount of reliance \ncould ever justify continuing a program that allows DHS to \nwield power that neither Congress nor the Constitution \ngave it. Any such decision would be “not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U. S. C. \n§§706(2)(A), (C). Accordingly, DHS would simply be engag-\ning in yet another exercise of unlawful power if it used reli-\nance interests to justify continuing the initially unlawful \nprogram, and a court would be obligated to set aside that \naction.15  \n  Even if reliance interests were sometimes relevant when \nrescinding an ultra vires action, the rescission still would \nnot be arbitrary and capricious here.  Rather, as the major-\nity does not dispute, the rescission is consistent with how\ndeferred action has always worked.  As a general matter, \ndeferred action creates no rights—it exists at the Govern-\nment’s discretion and can be revoked at any time.  See App.  \n—————— \n15The majority contends that this argument does not carry force be-\n \ncause the rescission implemented a winddown period during which re-\ncipients would continue to receive benefits.  But whether DHS’ decision \nto wind down DACA was lawful is a separate question from whether \nDHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing an \nunlawful program. \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The Government has made clear time \nand again that, because “deferred action is not an immigra-\ntion status, no alien has the right to deferred action.  It is  \nused solely in the discretion of the [Government] and con-\nfers no protection or benefit upon an alien.” DHS Immigra-\ntion and Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Re-\nmoval, Detention and Deportation Officers’ Field Manual \n§20.8 (Mar. 27, 2006); see also Memorandum from D.

Thus, con-\ntrary to the majority’s unsupported assertion,  ante, at 23,  \nthis longstanding administrative treatment of deferred ac-\ntion provides strong evidence and authority for the proposi-\ntion that an agency need not consider reliance interests in\nthis context.16  \n  Finally, it is inconceivable to require DHS to study reli-\nance interests before rescinding DACA considering how the \nprogram was previously defended.  DHS has made clear \nsince DACA’s inception that it would not consider such re-\nliance interests.  Contemporaneous with the DACA memo, \nDHS stated that “DHS can terminate or renew deferred ac-\ntion at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  Consideration  \n—————— \n16The majority’s  approach will make it far  more difficult to change \n \ndeferred-action programs going forward, which is hardly in keeping with \nthis Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in  \nadministrative discretion” used for administrative “convenience.”  Reno  \nv.

In fact,  \nDHS repeatedly argued in court that the 2014 memoran-\ndum was a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion in part \nbecause deferred action created no rights on which recipi-\nents could rely.

In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed \npetitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not \nresolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells \nthe Department of Homeland Security to go back and try \nagain. What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, with-\nout holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented \nthat from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  \nOur constitutional system is not supposed to work that way. \n  I join JUSTICE THOMAS’s opinion.   DACA presents a deli-\ncate political issue, but that is not our business. As JUSTICE \nTHOMAS explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and \nthat alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even  \nif DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for over-\nturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA repre-\nsented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its re-\nscission represented an exercise of that same discretion, \nand it would therefore be unreviewable under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the ex-\ntent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and \ncapricious for essentially the reasons explained by JUSTICE \nKAVANAUGH.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \n  For the last 20 years, the country has engaged in conse-\nquential policy, religious, and moral debates about the legal \nstatus of millions of young immigrants who, as children, \nwere brought to the United States and have lived here ever \nsince.  Those young immigrants do not have legal status in \nthe United States under current statutory law.  They live, \ngo to school, and work here with uncertainty about their \nfutures.  Despite many attempts over the last two decades, \nCongress has not yet enacted legislation to afford legal sta-\ntus to those immigrants. \n  In 2012, exercising its view of the Executive’s prosecuto-\nrial discretion under Article II and the immigration laws, \nPresident Obama’s administration unilaterally instituted a \nprogram known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nor DACA.  Under DACA, eligible young immigrants may \napply for and receive deferred action.  They must renew \ntheir DACA status every two years.  Under the program, \nthe Executive Branch broadly forbears from enforcing cer-\ntain immigration removal laws against DACA recipients.  \nAnd by virtue of the forbearance, DACA recipients also be-\ncome eligible for work authorization and other benefits. \n  Since  2017,  President  Trump’s  administration  has \nsought to rescind DACA based on its different and narrower \nunderstanding of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion \nunder Article II and the immigration laws.  In its view, the \nExecutive Branch legally may not, and as a policy matter \nshould not, unilaterally forbear from enforcing the immi-\ngration laws against such a large class of individuals.  The \ncurrent administration has stated that it instead wants to \nwork with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that \nwould address the legal status of those immigrants together \nwith other significant immigration issues. \n  The question before the Court is whether the Executive \nBranch acted lawfully in ordering rescission of the ongoing \nDACA program.  To begin with, all nine Members of the \nCourt accept, as do the DACA plaintiffs themselves, that \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nthe Executive Branch possesses the legal authority to re-\nscind DACA and to resume pre-DACA enforcement of the \nimmigration laws enacted by Congress.  Having previously \nadopted a policy of prosecutorial discretion and nonenforce-\nment with respect to a particular class of offenses or indi-\nviduals, the Executive Branch has the legal authority to re-\nscind such a policy and resume enforcing the law enacted \nby Congress.  The Executive Branch’s exercise of that re-\nscission authority is subject to constitutional constraints \nand may also be subject to statutory constraints.  The nar-\nrow legal dispute here concerns a statutory constraint—\nnamely, whether the Executive Branch’s action to rescind \nDACA satisfied the general arbitrary-and-capricious stand-\nard of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. \n  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  \nAs the Court has long stated, judicial review under that \nstandard is deferential to the agency.  The Court may not \nsubstitute its policy judgment for that of the agency.  The \nCourt simply ensures that the agency has acted within a \nbroad zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reason-\nably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  ex-\nplained the decision.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U. S. 502 (2009); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29 (1983). \n  The Executive Branch explained its decision to rescind \nDACA in two sequential memorandums by successive Sec-\nretaries of Homeland Security: the 2017 Duke Memoran-\ndum and the 2018 Nielsen Memorandum.  The Duke Mem-\norandum focused on DACA’s perceived legal flaws.  The \nCourt today finds the Duke Memorandum insufficient un-\nder the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  But regardless of whether the Court is correct about the \nDuke Memorandum, the Nielsen Memorandum more fully \nexplained the Department’s legal reasons for rescinding \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA, and clarified that even if DACA were lawful, the De-\npartment would still rescind DACA for a variety of policy \nreasons.    The  Nielsen  Memorandum  also  expressly  ad-\ndressed the reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nquestion under the APA’s deferential arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious standard is not whether we agree with the Depart-\nment’s decision to rescind DACA.  The question is whether \nthe Nielsen Memorandum reasonably explained the deci-\nsion to rescind DACA.  Under ordinary application of the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memoran-\ndum—with its alternative and independent rationales and \nits discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an expla-\nnation for the Executive Branch’s action. \n  The Nielsen Memorandum was issued nine months after \nthe Duke Memorandum.  Under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, the Nielsen Memorandum is itself a “rule” setting \nforth “an agency statement of general . . . applicability and \nfuture effect designed to implement . . . policy.”  5 U. S. C. \n§551(4).  Because it is a rule, the Nielsen Memorandum con-\nstitutes “agency action.”  §551(13).  As the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Nielsen had the authority to \ndecide whether to stick with Secretary Duke’s decision to \nrescind DACA, or to make a different decision.  Like Secre-\ntary Duke, Secretary Nielsen chose to rescind DACA, and \nshe provided additional explanation.  Her memorandum \nwas akin to common forms of agency action that follow ear-\nlier agency action on the same subject—for example, a sup-\nplemental or new agency statement of policy, or an agency \norder with respect to a motion for rehearing or reconsider-\nation.  Courts often consider an agency’s additional expla-\nnations of policy or additional explanations made, for exam-\nple, on agency rehearing or reconsideration, or on remand \nfrom a court, even if the agency’s bottom-line decision itself \ndoes not change. \n  Yet the Court today jettisons the Nielsen Memorandum \nby classifying it as a post hoc justification for rescinding \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA.  Ante, at 14–16.  Under our precedents, however, the \npost hoc justification doctrine merely requires that courts \nassess agency action based on the official explanations of \nthe agency decisionmakers, and not based on after-the-fact \nexplanations advanced by agency lawyers during litigation \n(or  by  judges).   See,  e.g.,  State  Farm, 463 U. S., at  50 \n(“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc ration-\nalizations for agency action”); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. \n380, 397 (1974) (same); NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n380 U. S. 438, 443–444 (1965) (same); Burlington Truck \nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) \n(same).  As the D. C. Circuit has explained, the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine “is not a time barrier which freezes an \nagency’s exercise of its judgment after an initial decision \nhas been made and bars it from further articulation of its \nreasoning.  It is a rule directed at reviewing courts which \nforbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of ra-\ntionales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  deci-\nsionmakers.”  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 6 \n(2006) (Garland, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Indeed, the ordinary judicial remedy for an agency’s in-\nsufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation \nby the relevant agency personnel.  It would make little \nsense for a court to exclude official explanations by agency \npersonnel such as a Cabinet Secretary simply because the \nexplanations are purportedly post hoc, and then to turn \naround and remand for further explanation by those same \nagency personnel.  Yet that is the upshot of the Court’s ap-\nplication of the post hoc justification doctrine today.  The \nCourt’s refusal to look at the Nielsen Memorandum seems \nparticularly  mistaken,  moreover,  because  the  Nielsen \nMemorandum shows that the Department, back in 2018, \nconsidered the policy issues that the Court today says the \nDepartment did not consider.  Ante, at 20–26. \n  To be sure, cases such as Overton Park and Camp v. Pitts \nsuggest that courts reviewing certain agency adjudications \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nmay in some circumstances decline to examine an after-the-\nfact agency explanation.  See Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, \n142–143 (1973) (per curiam); Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 419–421 (1971).  But \nagency adjudications are “concerned with the determina-\ntion of past and present rights and liabilities,” Attorney \nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 14 \n(1947), and implicate the due process interests of the indi-\nvidual parties to the adjudication.  Judicial review of an ad-\njudication therefore ordinarily focuses on what happened \nduring the agency’s adjudication process of deciding that in-\ndividual case. \n  Even if certain agency adjudications have a slightly more \nstringent restriction on post hoc explanations, the APA is \n“based upon a dichotomy between rule making and adjudi-\ncation,” ibid., and this case involves an ongoing agency rule \nthat has future effect—the rescission of DACA.  The Nielsen \nMemorandum implements and explains the rescission of \nDACA.  I am aware of no case from this Court, and the \nCourt today cites none, that has employed the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine to exclude an agency’s official explana-\ntion of an agency rule.  For purposes of arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious review, it does not matter whether the latest official \nexplanation was two years ago or three years ago.  What \nmatters is whether the explanation was reasonable and fol-\nlowed the requisite procedures.  In my view, the Court \nshould  consider  the  Nielsen  Memorandum  in  deciding \nwhether the Department’s rescission of DACA satisfies the \nAPA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  Because the Court excludes the Nielsen Memorandum, \nthe Court sends the case back to the Department of Home-\nland Security for further explanation.  Although I disagree \nwith the Court’s decision to remand, the only practical con-\nsequence of the Court’s decision to remand appears to be \nsome delay.  The Court’s decision seems to allow the De-\npartment on remand to relabel and reiterate the substance \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nof the Nielsen Memorandum, perhaps with some elabora-\ntion as suggested in the Court’s opinion.  Ante, at 23–26.*\n*    *    * \n  The Court’s resolution of this narrow APA issue of course \ncannot eliminate the broader uncertainty over the status of \nthe DACA recipients.  That uncertainty is a result of Con-\ngress’s inability thus far to agree on legislation, which in \nturn has forced successive administrations to improvise, \nthereby triggering many rounds of relentless litigation with \nthe prospect of more litigation to come.  In contrast to those \nnecessarily  short-lived  and  stopgap  administrative \nmeasures, the Article I legislative process could produce a \nsturdy and enduring solution to this issue, one way or the \nother, and thereby remove the uncertainty that has per-\nsisted for years for these young immigrants and the Na-\n—————— \n*Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s ar-\n \nbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not consider whether its prose-\ncutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” \nand therefore not subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the \nfirst place.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  Several judges have advanced argu-\nments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an \nexercise of forbearance authority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions \nabout whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial discretion \nagainst a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable \nunder the APA as “committed to agency discretion by law.”  Ibid.; see \nCasa De Maryland v.

For the reasons discussed below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nThis order incorporates the statement set forth in the order dated January 9, 2018,\n25\nlargely denying dismissal under FRCP 12(b)(1) and largely granting plaintiffs’ motion for\n26\nprovisional relief (Dkt. No. 234).  This order, however, addresses a separate motion by the\n27\ngovernment to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim for relief under FRCP 12(b)(6). \n28\nThis order sustains three claims for relief but finds that the rest fall short.  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 14\n1 ANALYSIS\n2 1. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n3   For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the\n4 rescission of DACA was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n5 accordance with law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as explained in the\n6 January 9 order, the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ APA claims under 5 U.S.C. §\n7 706(2)(A) is DENIED.\n8 2. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n9 The original DACA program began in 2012 without any notice or opportunity for public\n10 comment.  Likewise, the rescission in question ended DACA without notice or opportunity for\nt 11 public comment.  One issue now presented is whether the rescission is invalid for having been\nr\nu\no a 12 carried out without notice-and-comment procedures.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Under the APA, an agency action must be set aside if it was done “without observance\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  An agency is required to follow\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 prescribed notice-and-comment procedures before promulgating certain rules.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \nS N 16 The Regulatory Flexibility Act further requires that notice-and-comment rulemaking include\nted  For the  17 an assessment of the impact on small entities.  5 U.S.C. § 604(a).  These requirements do not\ni\nn\nU\n18 apply, however, to general statements of policy.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  \n19 A general statement of policy “advis[es] the public prospectively of the manner in which\n20 the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d\n21 1006, 1012–13 (9th Cir. 1987).  Such policies also “serve to educate and provide direction to\n22 the agency’s personnel in the field, who are required to implement its policies and exercise its\n23 discretionary power in specific cases.”  Id. at 1013 (quotes and citations omitted).  “The critical\n24 factor” in determining whether a directive constitutes a general statement of policy is “the\n25 extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to\n26 exercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.” \n27 Ibid.  Thus, to qualify as a statement of policy two requirements must be satisfied:  (1) the\n28 policy operates only prospectively, and (2) the policy does “not establish a binding norm,” and\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 14\n1 is not “finally determinative of the issues or rights to which [it] address[es],” but instead leaves\n2 officials “free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise.”  Id. at 1014\n3 (quotes and citations omitted).  Under this standard, the rescission memorandum is a general\n4 statement of policy.\n5 This order rejects plaintiffs’ contention that the rescission could only be done through\n6 notice and comment.  For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed no notice\n7 and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.  \n8 Almost this exact problem was addressed in Mada-Luna.  There, our court of appeals\n9 held that the repeal of an INS policy under which applicants could seek deferred action was not\n10 subject to notice and comment.  It rejected the argument that the repeal could not constitute a\nt 11 general statement of policy because it diminished the likelihood of receiving deferred action for\nr\nu\no a 12 a class of individuals.  Id. at 1016.  Rather, because the original policy allowed for discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 and failed to establish a “binding norm,” the repeal of that policy also did not require notice and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 comment.  Id. at 1017.  So too here.  The DACA program allowed but did not require the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 agency to grant deferred action, and upon separate application, travel authorization, on a case-\nS N 16 by-case basis at the agency’s discretion.  Therefore, neither its promulgation nor its rescission\nted  For the  17 required notice and comment.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 Parco v. Morris, 426 F. Supp. 976 (E.D. Pa. 1977), on which plaintiffs heavily rely,\n19 does not warrant the conclusion that the rescission policy is a substantive rule.  Parco also\n20 addressed whether the rescission of an INS policy required notice and comment.  Notably, the\n21 government in Parco stipulated that the policy’s precipitous rescission was the sole reason for\n22 denial of the plaintiff’s application for immigration relief.  Id. at 984.  The district court\n23 determined that the repeal therefore left no discretion, explaining that “discretion” was stripped\n24 of all meaning where “one contends that under a certain regulation ‘discretion’ was exercised\n25 favorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal of the regulation, unfavorably in\n26 each such case.”  Ibid.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not allege that all deferred action\n27 applications under DACA were approved but now, after the rescission, all requests for deferred\n28 action will be denied.  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffs argue that the rescission memorandum is more than a policy because it creates\n2 a blanket prohibition against granting deferred action to DACA applicants.  Plaintiffs are\n3 correct that the rescission policy contains mandatory language on its face.  It is also true that the\n4 rescission memorandum categorically eliminates advance parole for DACA recipients. \n5 This comes closer to resembling a substantive rule.  However, it remains the case that because\n6 the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require notice and comment,\n7 a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.  Mada-Luna, 813 F.2d\n8 at 1017.  \n9 Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Section 706(2)(D) of the\n10 APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is accordingly GRANTED.\nt 11 3. DUE PROCESS CLAIMS.\nr\nu\no a 12 To assert a due process claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she has an interest in\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 liberty or property protected by the Constitution.  See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (1972).  Plaintiffs fail to make the threshold showing that they have a protected interest in the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 continuation of DACA and, accordingly, their due process claims based on the rescission must\nS N 16 be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged, however, that the agency’s changes to its\nted  For the  17 information-sharing policy are “fundamentally unfair.”  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. Deferred Action.\n19 Because discretionary immigration relief “is a privilege created by Congress, denial of\n20 such relief cannot violate a substantive interest protected by the Due Process clause.”  Munoz v.\n21 Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 30 (1996)). \n22 Moreover, “aliens have no fundamental right to discretionary relief from removal” for purposes\n23 of due process.  Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2004).  Our court of\n24 appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, since such relief\n25 is “entirely within the discretion of the Attorney General.”  Kwai Fun Wong v. United States,\n26 373 F.3d 952, 967–68 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor did an INS policy which allowed the agency to\n27 recommend deferred action as “an act of administrative choice” create substantive liberty\n28 interests.  Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1985).  These authorities\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 14\n1 foreclose any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in continued deferred action or\n2 advance parole under DACA.1\n3 Plaintiffs reply that even absent a protected interest in the initial, discretionary grant of\n4 deferred action, there is a protected interest in the renewal of DACA and its associated benefits. \n5 Yet a benefit is not a “protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it\n6 in their discretion.”  Castle Rock, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  Rather, an individual has a\n7 protected property right in public benefits where the rules conferring those benefits “greatly\n8 restrict the discretion” of the people who administer them.  Nozzi v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los\n9 Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs’ authorities confirm that the same\n10 principle applies in the context of renewing or retaining existing benefits.  Wedges/Ledges of\nt 11 California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 64 (9th Cir. 1994); Stauch v. City of\nr\nu\no a 12 Columbia Heights, 212 F.3d 425, 430 (8th Cir. 2000).  No such limitations on agency discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are alleged to have applied under DACA.  Rather, the USCIS DACA FAQs referenced by\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 plaintiffs in their complaints make clear that “USCIS retain[ed] the ultimate discretion to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether deferred action [was] appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines\nS N 16 [were] met” (Garcia Compl. ¶ 24 n.16; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; UC Compl., Exh. B; State\nted  For the  17 Compl., Exh. E).\ni\nn\nU\n18 Next, plaintiffs argue that once DACA status was conferred, and recipients organized\n19 their lives in reliance on the program’s protections and benefits, they developed interests\n20 protected by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ authorities, however, stand only for the\n21 uncontroversial proposition that once in possession of a particular benefit, the alteration,\n22 revocation or suspension of that benefit may implicate due process.2  Such a principle has no\n23 application where, as here, extant benefits are not impacted by a change in policy.  Indeed, there\n24 is no dispute that the rescission acts only prospectively.  That is, all existing DACA recipients\n25\n1  Plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish Romeiro de Silva on the ground that the INS policy there involved\n26\n“unfettered discretion,” whereas the exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA was guided by standard\noperating procedures, is unconvincing.  \n27\n2  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971); Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court For Dist. of Arizona,\n28\n349 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir. 2003); Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2017 WL 5176720, at *9\n(W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017).\n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 14\n1 will receive deferred action through the end of their two-year terms.  What they will not receive,\n2 if the rescission endures, will be DACA renewal, thereafter.  For this reason, Ixcot v. Holder,\n3 646 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011), and Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), which\n4 addressed whether amendments to the INA were impermissibly retroactive, do not compel a\n5 different result.\n6 Plaintiffs contend that the government’s communications with plaintiffs regarding\n7 renewals, its operation of the program, and the public promises of government officials\n8 “together created an understanding that DACA recipients were entitled to the continued benefits\n9 of the program so long as they met the renewal criteria” (Dkt. No. 205 at 29).  Plaintiffs are\n10 correct, of course, that claims of entitlement can be defined by “rules or mutually explicit\nt 11 understandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  Importantly, however, a\nr\nu\no a 12 person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 held, does not create a protected right if that belief is not mutually held by the government. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Gerhart v. Lake Cty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2011).  An agency’s past practice of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 generally granting a government benefit is also insufficient to establish a legal entitlement. \nS N 16 Ibid.\nted  For the  17 This order empathizes with those DACA recipients who have built their lives around\ni\nn\nU\n18 the expectation that DACA, and its associated benefits, would continue to be available to them\n19 if they played by the rules.  That expectation, however, remains insufficient to give rise to a\n20 constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment.  Because plaintiffs have failed to allege facts\n21 demonstrating a protected interest in DACA’s continuation or the renewal of benefits\n22 thereunder, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on the rescission\n23 must be GRANTED.  \n24 B. Information-Sharing Policy.\n25 Plaintiffs fare better with their substantive due process claim that DHS allegedly\n26 changed its policy with respect to the personal information provided by DACA recipients\n27 during the application process.  Plaintiffs allege that the government repeatedly represented\n28 that information provided by DACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 14\n1 purposes absent special circumstances, and that DACA recipients relied on these promises in\n2 submitting the extensive personal information needed to meet the program’s requirements.\n3 Defendants insist that the agency’s information-sharing policy remains unchanged. \n4 On a motion to dismiss, however, the well-pled factual allegations in a complaint must be\n5 accepted as true.  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir.\n6 2008).  Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that DHS changed its information-sharing policy such\n7 that now, rather than affirmatively protecting DACA recipients’ information from disclosure,\n8 the government will only refrain from “proactively” providing their information for purposes of\n9 immigration enforcement proceedings (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State\n10 Compl. ¶ 122).  \nt 11 Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged a “mutually explicit understanding” giving rise\nr\nu\no a 12 to a protected interest in the confidentiality of DACA recipients’ personal information. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 They allege that throughout DACA’s existence, DHS made affirmative representations as to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 how this information would (and would not) be used.  The policy stated (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126;\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State Compl. ¶ 121 (citing USCIS DACA FAQs)): \nS N 16 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nted  For the  17 tpor oIcCeEe dainndg sC uBnPle fsosr t hthee r pequurpeostsoer o mf eimetms tihgera ctiroitne reina ffoorrc ethmee insstuance\ni\nn of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set\nU\n18 forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance\n(www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred\n19 pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE.  The information\nmay be shared with national security and law enforcement\n20 agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\nincluding for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify\n21 or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for\nthe investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above\n22 information sharing policy covers family members and guardians,\nin addition to the requestor.  This policy, which may be modified,\n23 superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended\nto, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or\n24 benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party\nin any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n25\nThe language contained in the policy’s caveat, that it could “be modified, superseded,\n26\nor rescinded at any time,” is ambiguous.  One reading advanced by the government is that this\n27\ncaveat allows the agency to change how it treats information already received from DACA\n28\napplicants.  Another reading, however, is that it simply allows the government to change its\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 14\n1 policy in connection with future applicants.  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson’s\n2 December 2016 letter to United States Representative Judy Chu supports the later reading. \n3 He stated that, “[s]ince DACA was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that\n4 information provided by applicants . . . will not later be used for immigration enforcement\n5 purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security\n6 or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance\n7 of a notice to appear is required by law” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 36–37; State Compl. ¶ 98, Exh. F). \n8 This ambiguity presents a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings.  \n9 Taken as true at this stage, as must be done on a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion, plaintiffs’\n10 allegations regarding the government’s broken promise as to how DACA recipients’ personal\nt 11 information will be used — and its potentially profound consequences — “shock[s] the\nr\nu\no a 12 conscience and offend[s] the community’s sense of fair play and decency.”  Marsh v. County of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 San Diego, 680 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotes and citations omitted).  Defendants’\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on changes to the government’s\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 information-use policy is DENIED.  \nS N 16 4. EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL.\nted  For the  17 Plaintiffs bring claims for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government should not be\ni\nn\nU\n18 permitted to terminate DACA or use the information collected from applicants for immigration\n19 enforcement purposes. \n20 Defendants first contend that plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims fail because there is no\n21 recognized claim for relief based on estoppel.  The Supreme Court has refused to adopt,\n22 however, “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any circumstances run against the Government,”\n23 noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the Government can enforce the law free from\n24 estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum\n25 standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their Government.”  Heckler v.\n26 Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60–61 (1984).  Moreover, our court of\n27 appeals has addressed such claims on the merits, and has held that the government may be\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 9 of 14\n1 subject to equitable estoppel if it has engaged in “affirmative misconduct.”  Watkins v. U.S.\n2 Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706–07 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n3 To state an equitable estoppel claim against the government, a party must show\n4 (1) that the government engaged in “affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence”; and\n5 (2) “the government’s wrongful act will cause a serious injustice, and the public’s interest will\n6 not suffer undue damage” if the requested relief is granted.  Id. at 707.  “Neither the failure to\n7 inform an individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation\n8 constitute affirmative misconduct.”  Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 2000). \n9 Moreover, our court of appeals has defined “affirmative misconduct” to mean a “deliberate lie”\n10 or “a pattern of false promises.”  Socop-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001). \nt 11 The allegations in the complaints fail to meet this standard, inasmuch as no affirmative instances\nr\nu\no a 12 of misrepresentation or concealment have been plausibly alleged.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs are correct that estoppel “does not require that the government intend to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 mislead a party,” Watkins, 875 F.2d 707, but plaintiffs fail to explain how contradictory policies\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 under two different administrations add up to “affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence.”\nS N 16  Plaintiffs fail to allege, for example, that the government’s past statements regarding DACA’s\nted  For the  17 legality were a “deliberate lie” or more than mere negligence.  Nor have plaintiffs pleaded that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the alleged change in the agency’s information-use policy was the result of an affirmative\n19 misrepresentation.  Rather, they have merely alleged a change in policy.  Under plaintiffs’ theory\n20 new administrations would almost never be able to change prior policies because someone could\n21 always assert reliance upon the old policy.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ equitable\n22 estoppel claims is GRANTED. \n23 5. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS.  \n24 To state an equal protection claim plaintiffs must show that the rescission was motivated\n25 by a discriminatory purpose.  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (2015) (citing Vill. of\n26 Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977)).  Determining\n27 whether discrimination is a motivating factor “demands a sensitive inquiry into such\n28 circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 10 of 14\n1 266.  A plaintiff need not show that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the\n2 challenged action, but only that it was a “motivating factor.”  Ibid.  In analyzing whether a\n3 facially-neutral policy was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, district courts must consider\n4 factors such as whether the policy creates a disparate impact, the historical background and\n5 sequence of events leading up to the decision, and any relevant legislative or administrative\n6 history.  Id. at 266–68.3  \n7 First, Individual Plaintiffs and Santa Clara clearly allege that the rescission had a\n8 disproportionate impact on Latinos and Mexican nationals.  Indeed, such individuals account\n9 for 93 percent of DACA recipients (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 100, 151; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 9, 75). \n10 Defendants reply that this disparate impact is an accident of geography, not evidence of\nt 11 discrimination.  True, a disparate impact of a facially-neutral rule, standing alone, cannot\nr\nu\no a 12 establish discriminatory intent.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976).  Individual\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs and Santa Clara, however, have alleged a discriminatory impact only as a starting\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 point.  They also allege a history of bias leading up to the rescission of DACA in the form of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 campaign statements and other public comments by President Trump, as next discussed.4 \nS N 16 Second, plaintiffs allege that President Trump has, on multiple occasions since he\nted  For the  17 announced his presidential campaign, expressed racial animus towards Latinos and Mexicans. \ni\nn\nU\n18 When President Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, for example, he\n19 characterized Mexicans as criminals, rapists, and “people that have lots of problems.”  Three\n20 days later, President Trump tweeted that “[d]ruggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming\n21 across the southern border,” and asked, “When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?” \n22\n23\n3  The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), which addressed\nthe showing necessary for a defendant to be entitled to discovery on a selective-prosecution claim, has no\n24\napplication here.  Plaintiffs’ claims cannot fairly be characterized as selective-prosecution claims because they\ndo not “implicate the Attorney General’s prosecutorial discretion — that is, in this context, his discretion to\n25\nchoose to deport one person rather than another among those who are illegally in the country.”  Kwai Fun\nWong, 373 F.3d at 970.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that the agency’s decision to end a nationwide deferred action\n26\nprogram was motivated by racial animus towards a protected class.  \n27\n4  The City of San Jose’s equal protection claim falls a little short.  Rather than alleging a disparate\nimpact on a protected class, it alleges only that “[d]efendants’ actions target individuals for discriminatory\n28\ntreatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification” (San Jose Compl. ¶ 54).  For this reason,\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss San Jose’s equal protection claim is GRANTED.  \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 11 of 14\n1 During the first Republican presidential debate, President Trump claimed that the Mexican\n2 government “send[s] the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them.”  And in\n3 August 2017, he referred to undocumented immigrants as “animals” who are responsible for “the\n4 drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, MS 13” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶\n5 102–13, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 75–76).\n6 Circumstantial evidence of intent, including statements by a decisionmaker, may be\n7 considered in evaluating whether government action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. \n8 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68.  These statements were not about the rescission (which\n9 came later) but they still have relevance to show racial animus against people south of our\n10 border. \nt 11 Should campaign rhetoric be admissible to undermine later agency action by the victors? \nr\nu\no a 12 This order recognizes that such admissibility can readily lead to mischief in challenging the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 policies of a new administration.  We should proceed with caution and give wide berth to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 democratic process.  Yet are clear cut indications of racial prejudice on the campaign trail to be\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 forgotten altogether?\nS N 16 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “evidence of purpose beyond the face of the\nted  For the  17 challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause\ni\nn\nU\n18 claims.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017).  Washington found that\n19 President Trump’s statements regarding a “Muslim ban” raised “serious allegations and\n20 presented significant constitutional questions,” although it ultimately reserved consideration of\n21 plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Id. at 1167–68.  Citing to Washington, at least two district\n22 courts have since considered President Trump’s campaign statements in finding a likelihood of\n23 success on Establishment Clause claims.  See, e.g., Aziz v. Trump, 234 F. Supp. 3d 724, 736\n24 (E.D. Va. 2017) (Judge Leonie Brinkema); Hawai’i v. Trump, 245 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236 (D.\n25 Haw. 2017) (Judge Derrick Watson).  This order will follow these decisions and hold that, at\n26 least at the pleading stage, campaign rhetoric so closely tied to the challenged executive action is\n27 admissible to show racial animus.  \n28\n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 14\n1 Third, a final consideration is the unusual history behind the rescission.  DACA received\n2 reaffirmation by the agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be\n3 hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality). \n4 This strange about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration\n5 within the agency was bypassed (Garcia Compl. ¶ 154; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 8, 77).  \n6 That President Trump has at other times shown support for DACA recipients cannot wipe\n7 the slate clean as a matter of law at the pleading stage.  Although the government argues that\n8 these allegations fail to suggest that the Acting Secretary (as the purported decisionmaker)\n9 terminated DACA due to racial animus, plaintiffs have alleged that it was President Trump\n10 himself who, in line with his campaign rhetoric, directed the decision to end the program\nt 11 (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 11, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 21).\nr\nu\no a 12 Construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as must be done at the pleading stage,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 these allegations raise a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.  The fact-intensive inquiry needed to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether defendants acted with discriminatory intent cannot be made on the pleadings. \nS N 16 Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss Santa Clara’s and Individual Plaintiffs’ equal\nted  For the  17 protection claims must be DENIED.\ni\nn\nU\n18 State Plaintiffs allege an equal protection claim on the alternative theory that the\n19 rescission “violates fundamental conceptions of justice by depriving DACA grantees, as a class,\n20 of their substantial interests in pursuing a livelihood to support themselves and further their\n21 education” (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77).  Plaintiffs do not respond to the government’s arguments\n22 that this theory fails to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6).  Defendants’ motion to dismiss State\n23 Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is accordingly GRANTED.  \n24 6. DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n25 Defendants move to dismiss the Individual Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief. \n26 Individual Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief is also contained in their prayer for relief and,\n27 accordingly, the standalone claim is superfluous.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim is\n28 GRANTED.\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 14\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 Consistent with the foregoing, defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and\n3 DENIED IN PART as follows:\n4 • Plaintiffs’ APA claims are sustained, except for the following:  Garcia\n5 Complaint – Fifth Claim for Relief; UC Complaint – Second Claim for\n6 Relief; State Complaint – Second Claim for Relief; San Jose Complaint\n7 – Second Claim for Relief.\n8 • Plaintiffs’ Regulatory Flexibility Act claims are dismissed.\n9 • Plaintiffs’ due process claims are sustained, except for the following: \n10 UC Complaint – Third Claim for Relief; Garcia Complaint –\nt 11 First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on the rescission);\nr\nu\no a 12 Santa Clara Complaint – First Claim for Relief (to the extent based on\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the rescission).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims are sustained, except for the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 following:  State Complaint – Sixth Claim for Relief; San Jose\nS N 16 Complaint – First Claim for Relief.\nted  For the  17 • Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims are dismissed.\ni\nn\nU\n18 • Individual Plaintiffs’ declaratory relief claim is dismissed.  \n19 Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR DAYS from the date of\n20 this order to file motions, noticed on the normal 35-day track, seeking leave to amend solely\n21 as to the claims dismissed above.  Proposed amended complaints must be appended to each\n22 motion and plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how\n23 the amendments to the complaints cure the deficiencies identified herein and should include as\n24 an exhibit a redlined or highlighted version of the complaints identifying all changes.  \n25 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\n26 The district court hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues of whether\n27 (i) President Trump’s campaign statements are properly considered in evaluating plaintiffs’\n28 equal protection claims, (ii) whether the Individual Plaintiffs’ and County of Santa Clara’s\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 65   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 14\n1 allegations as pleaded state an equal protection claim, (iii) whether plaintiffs’ allegations\n2 concerning changes to the government’s information-sharing policy state a due process claim;\n3 (iv) whether plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under 5 U.S.C. § 553; and (v) whether\n4 plaintiffs have failed to state a due process claim based on the rescission of DACA.  This order\n5 finds that these are controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for\n6 difference of opinion and that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the\n7 litigation.  \n8\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n10\nt 11 Dated:  January 12, 2018.                                                            \nr\nu WILLIAM ALSUP\no a 12 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n14",

Brought to this \n3 country as children and raised in families that often struggled with poverty and homelessness, each \n4 has achieved remarkable success through hard work, fierce determination, and incredible resilience.  \n5 These are characteristics that have defined Americans throughout our Nation’s history.  Plaintiffs in \n6 this case are also alike in that each has committed to helping others, choosing to direct their time, \n7 energy, and considerable talents toward defending, healing, educating, and uplifting individuals and \n8 communities that are too often ignored.  While each of the Plaintiffs is remarkable in his or her own \n9 right, their stories of success—and their commitment to serving others—are common among the \n10 nearly 800,000 young people who have come to rely on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n11 (“DACA”) program.   \n12 The decision to end the DACA program is a broken promise and an unprecedented violation \n13 of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and other young people who relied on the federal government \n14 to honor that promise.  The government established the DACA program with great fanfare in 2012.  \n15 Under DACA, individuals who were brought to the United States as children and meet certain \n16 criteria, and who are investigated and found to pose no threat to public safety or national security, are \n17 granted deferred action and work authorization for a two-year period, subject to renewal.  These \n18 young people are commonly referred to as “Dreamers” in recognition of the fact that they have long \n19 called this country home and aspire to be part of the American Dream. \n20 To apply for DACA, eligible individuals are required to provide the government with highly \n21 sensitive personal information, pay a substantial fee, and submit to a rigorous Department of \n22 Homeland Security background check.  Initially, the DACA program was met with skepticism in \n23 immigrant communities, as many Dreamers were understandably reluctant to voluntarily disclose \n24 information (including their current home address) that could facilitate their removal from the United \n25 States and place their family members at risk.  To combat this fear the government launched an \n26 extensive outreach campaign urging Dreamers to apply for DACA, repeatedly promising that they \n27 would be able to renew their DACA status and that information they provided in connection with the \n28 program would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes.  As a result, hundreds of \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  1   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 4 of 46\n \n1 thousands of young people applied for, and were granted, DACA status.  The government quickly \n2 realized the administrative, law enforcement, public safety, and economic benefits it sought in \n3 establishing the program. \n4 In creating DACA, the government offered Plaintiffs and other Dreamers a straightforward \n5 deal—if they stepped forward, shared sensitive personal information, and passed a background check, \n6 they would be granted renewable protection and would be allowed to live and work in the United \n7 States provided that they played by the rules.  DACA also provided access to important benefits, and \n8 enabled recipients to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards, start businesses, purchase homes and \n9 cars, and conduct other aspects of daily life that were otherwise often unavailable to them.  In so \n10 doing, DACA has allowed Plaintiffs and nearly 800,000 young people to become contributing \n11 members of society and pursue the American Dream. \n12 In taking the irreversible step of identifying themselves to the government, Plaintiffs and \n13 other Dreamers trusted the government to honor its word and uphold its end of the bargain.  In \n14 reliance on the government’s promises, DACA recipients took out student loans, accepted job offers, \n15 moved to new cities, started businesses, bought homes and cars, and made numerous other life \n16 changing decisions.  They allowed themselves to fall in love, get married, and start families, trusting \n17 that the security and work authorization provided under DACA would enable them to care for (and \n18 remain in this country with) their spouses and children.   \n19 The transformative impact DACA had for Plaintiffs cannot be overstated.  Brought to this \n20 country as young children, Plaintiffs have spent virtually their entire lives in the United States.  They \n21 consider themselves to be Americans and call our nation home.  Yet for much of their lives, Plaintiffs \n22 were denied basic opportunities and prohibited from realizing their full potential.  But DACA \n23 changed everything.  Beyond a work permit and access to a professional license, DACA provided \n24 Plaintiffs the certainty and security necessary to enroll in graduate programs, open businesses, hire \n25 employees, build relationships with clients, patients, and students, and begin to start families of their \n26 own.  Plaintiffs were able to take these risks, and enjoy the benefits of their hard work, because they \n27 trusted the government to honor its promises and live up to its word. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  2   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 5 of 46\n \n1 Notwithstanding the severe harm it will inflict, the government arbitrarily decided to break its \n2 promises to Plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers by terminating the DACA \n3 program.  This cruel bait and switch, which was motivated by unconstitutional bias against Mexicans \n4 and Latinos, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, the due process rights \n5 of Plaintiffs and other DACA recipients, and federal law, including the Administrative Procedure \n6 Act.  Plaintiffs therefore seek equitable and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful and \n7 unconstitutional action, and respectfully request that the Court compel the government to honor its \n8 promises and uphold its end of the DACA bargain. \n9 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n10 1.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under \n11 the Constitution and laws of the United States.  This Court has additional remedial authority under \n12 the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act, \n13 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. \n14 2.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n15 § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1) because at least one plaintiff resides in this District, a substantial part of the \n16 events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District, and each defendant is an \n17 agency of the United States or an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity. \n18 3.  Pursuant to Local Rules 3-2(c) and (d), intradistrict assignment is proper in San \n19 Francisco or Oakland because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the \n20 claim occurred in the Counties of San Francisco and Alameda. \n21 PARTIES \n22 4.  Plaintiff Dulce Garcia (“Ms. Garcia”) is a DACA recipient and an attorney in San \n23 Diego, California.  Ms. Garcia earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of California, San \n24 Diego and her law degree from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.  She was brought to the \n25 United States from Mexico when she was four years old.  The government’s decision to terminate \n26 the DACA program will deprive Ms. Garcia of her DACA status and the numerous valuable benefits \n27 she is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination of DACA also will frustrate Ms. Garcia’s \n28 ability to represent her clients and harm the dozens of individuals who rely on her counsel.    \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  3   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 6 of 46\n \n1 5.  Plaintiff Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza (“Ms. Chabolla”) is a DACA recipient and a \n2 first-year law student at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.  Ms. Chabolla was \n3 brought to the United States from Mexico when she was two years old.  The government’s decision \n4 to terminate the DACA program will deprive Ms. Mendoza of her DACA status and the numerous \n5 valuable benefits she is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination of DACA also will \n6 frustrate Ms. Chabolla’s ability to fulfill her dream of working as a lawyer and helping individuals \n7 from disadvantaged and underrepresented communities obtain justice through the legal system. \n8 6.  Plaintiff Jirayut (“New”) Latthivongskorn (“Mr. Latthivongskorn”) is a DACA \n9 recipient and a fourth-year medical student at the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) \n10 School of Medicine.  He is also a candidate for a Master of Public Health degree from the T.H. Chan \n11 School of Public Health at Harvard University.  Mr. Latthivongskorn was brought to the United \n12 States from Thailand when he was nine years old.  The government’s decision to terminate the \n13 DACA program will deprive Mr. Latthivongskorn of his DACA status and the numerous valuable \n14 benefits he is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination of DACA also will frustrate \n15 Mr. Latthivongskorn’s ability to fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor and providing care to \n16 underserved and unprivileged communities. \n17 7.  Plaintiff Norma Ramirez (“Ms. Ramirez”) is a DACA recipient and a candidate for \n18 a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.  \n19 Ms. Ramirez was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was five years old.  The \n20 government’s decision to terminate the DACA program will deprive Ms. Ramirez of her DACA \n21 status and the numerous valuable benefits she is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination \n22 of DACA also will frustrate Ms. Ramirez’s ability to realize her dream of opening a free \n23 multidisciplinary therapy clinic to immigrant youth and their families.   \n24 8.  Plaintiff Miriam Gonzalez Avila (“Ms. Gonzalez”) is a DACA recipient and a \n25 teacher at Crown Preparatory Academy in Los Angeles, California.  She is also a candidate for a \n26 Master of Arts in Urban Education from Loyola Marymount University.  Ms. Gonzalez was brought \n27 to the United States from Mexico when she was six years old.  The government’s decision to \n28 terminate the DACA program will deprive Ms. Gonzalez of her DACA status and the numerous \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  4   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 7 of 46\n \n1 valuable benefits she is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination of DACA also will \n2 frustrate Ms. Gonzalez’s ability to teach children in underserved communities, thereby harming the \n3 children, families, and community who have come to rely on her.   \n4 9.  Plaintiff Saul Jimenez Suarez (“Mr. Jimenez”) is a DACA recipient and a special \n5 education teacher, coach, and mentor in Los Angeles, California.  Mr. Jimenez was brought to the \n6 United States from Mexico when he was one year old.  The government’s decision to terminate the \n7 DACA program will deprive Mr. Jimenez of his DACA status and the numerous valuable benefits \n8 he is entitled to by virtue of that status.  The termination of DACA also will frustrate Mr. Jimenez’s \n9 ability to teach and coach young people, including those with special needs, thereby harming dozens \n10 of families and making poorer the community that he is serving and making a better place.   \n11 10.  Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n12 departments responsible for the implementation, administration, and termination of the DACA \n13 program. \n14 11.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  President Trump \n15 made the decision to terminate the DACA program and is sued in his official capacity. \n16 12.  Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet department of the \n17 federal government with responsibility for, among other things, administering and enforcing the \n18 nation’s immigration laws.  \n19 13.  Defendant Elaine Duke is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and is sued in \n20 her official capacity.  Secretary Duke is responsible for managing DHS, including the administration \n21 and enforcement of policies and practices related to DACA. \n22 STATEMENT OF FACTS \n23 Establishment of the DACA Program \n24 14.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \n25 memorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”).  Under DACA, \n26 individuals who were brought to the United States as young children and who met certain specific \n27 criteria could request deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal.  In exchange, \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  5   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 8 of 46\n \n1 DACA applicants were required to provide the government with highly sensitive personal \n2 information, submit to a rigorous background check, and pay a considerable fee.1 \n3 15.   Deferred action is a well-established form of prosecutorial discretion under which \n4 the government defers removal action against an individual for a specified period, subject to \n5 renewal.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum explained that DACA covers “certain young people who \n6 were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home” and that the \n7 immigration laws are not “designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may \n8 not have lived or even speak the language.”2 \n9 16.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established specific criteria that “should be satisfied \n10 before an individual is considered for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”3  They are that the \n11 applicant: \n12   came to the United States under the age of sixteen; \n13   has continuously resided in the United States for at least five years preceding the date of the \n14 memorandum and is present in the United States on the date of the memorandum; \n15   is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education \n16 development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed \n17 Forces of the United States; \n18   has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple \n19 misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; and \n20   is not above the age of thirty.4 \n21\n22\n23\n                                                 \n24   1  Memorandum from Secretary Janet Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect \nto Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children, at 1–2 (June 15, 2012), \n25 https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-\ncame-to-us-as-children.pdf (hereinafter “2012 DACA Memorandum”). \n26\n  2  Id. \n27   3  Id. at 1. \n28   4  Id. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  6   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 9 of 46\n \n1 17.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum further provided that “[n]o individual should \n2 receive deferred action . . . unless they first pass a background check and requests for relief . . . are \n3 to be decided on a case by case basis.”5 \n4 18.  USCIS describes DACA as follows:  “Deferred action is a discretionary \n5 determination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion.  For \n6 purposes of future inadmissibility based upon unlawful presence, an individual whose case has been \n7 deferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred action is in \n8 effect.  An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in the \n9 United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the period deferred \n10 action is in effect.  However, deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an individual, nor \n11 does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.”6 \n12 19.  Like other forms of deferred action, DACA serves the government’s interests by \n13 allowing the government to prioritize resources and exercise discretion for its own convenience.  \n14 DACA also has provided the government with tremendous law enforcement, public safety, and \n15 economic benefits.  As the government has recognized, our nation “continue[s] to benefit . . . from \n16 the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than to \n17 contribute to our country and our shared future.”7 \n18 The DACA Application and Renewal Process \n19 20.  To apply for DACA, applicants must submit extensive documentation establishing \n20 that they meet the relevant criteria.8  Applicants must also submit a Form I-765 Application for \n21 Employment Authorization, and pay $495 in fees.9 \n22\n                                                 \n23   5  Id. at 2. \n  6  USCIS DACA FAQs (Archived), Question 1, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-\n24 questions (hereinafter “USCIS DACA FAQs”).  \n25   7  Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson to U.S. Representative Judy Chu (Dec. 30, 2016), \nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response%20to%20\n26 Chu%2012.30.16.pdf (hereinafter “Secretary Johnson Letter”). \n  8  USCIS DACA FAQs, Questions 28–41. \n27\n  9  Id., Question 7; see also USCIS, I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  7   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 10 of 46\n \n1 21.  DACA applicants must also undergo biometric and biographic background checks.  \n2 When conducting these checks, DHS reviews the applicant’s biometric and biographic information \n3 “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government agencies.”10  If any \n4 information “indicates that [the applicant’s] presence in the United States threatens public safety or \n5 national security,” the applicant will be ineligible for DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.”11 \n6 22.  DACA is not limited to a single, two-year deferral of action.  On the contrary, the \n7 ability to renew DACA status is an essential element of the program and one of the main benefits \n8 used to induce Dreamers to step forward, subject themselves to a rigorous background investigation, \n9 and share sensitive personal information with the government.  Indeed, the government clearly \n10 understood from the very beginning that Dreamers would not apply for DACA, and the program \n11 would not be successful, unless they were promised the opportunity to renew their DACA status. \n12 23.  To that end, the 2012 DACA Memorandum explicitly directs that DACA be \n13 “subject to renewal, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal \n14 proceedings or removed from the United States.”12  That memorandum also makes clear that DACA \n15 is meant to protect “productive young people” who “were brought to this country as children and \n16 know only this country as home” and not merely postpone their removal for two years.13 \n17 24.  DHS also established a straightforward renewal process for DACA and “strongly \n18 encourage[d]” DACA recipients to submit their renewal request in advance of the relevant \n19 expiration date.14  Moreover, DACA renewal does not require DACA recipients to meet all of the \n20 initial criteria for the program, nor does it require them to submit additional documents.15  On the \n21 contrary, to qualify for renewal, DACA recipients are required to meet three basic criteria:  (1) they \n22 must not have left the United States without advance parole; (2) they must have continuously \n23\n                                                 \n24  10  USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 23.  \n25  11  Id., Question 65. \n 12  2012 DACA Memorandum, at 3 (emphasis added). \n26\n 13  Id. \n27  14  USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 49. \n28  15  Id., Questions 53–54. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  8   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 11 of 46\n \n1 resided in the United States after submitting their DACA application; and (3) they must not have \n2 been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, or otherwise \n3 pose a threat to national security or public safety.16  \n4 25.  DHS “Standard Operating Procedures” also provide that, absent an “Egregious \n5 Public Safety” issue or other special circumstances, DACA status should not be revoked until the \n6 government has provided a “Notice of Intent to Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[s]” the \n7 grounds for the termination.17  DHS policy further provides that the recipients of such notice should \n8 be afforded 33 days to “file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in the Notice of Intent \n9 to Terminate” prior to termination of DACA status.18  \n10 26.  Collectively, these policies and procedures, and the representations of numerous \n11 government officials, created a clear and reasonable expectation among DACA recipients that they \n12 would be entitled to continuously renew their DACA status so long as they stayed out of trouble and \n13 played by the rules. \n14 Benefits Provided Under the DACA Program \n15 27.  DACA confers numerous important benefits on those who apply for and are granted \n16 DACA status.  Notably, DACA recipients are granted the right not to be arrested or detained based \n17 solely on their immigration status during the time period their deferred action is in effect.19 \n18 28.  DACA recipients are also eligible for work authorization under longstanding \n19 regulations.  As USCIS has explained, “an individual whose case has been deferred is eligible to \n20 receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action . . . .”20 \n21\n                                                 \n22\n 16  Id., Question 51. \n23  17  See DHS National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA), at 132, 144–45 (Apr. 4, 2013), \n24 https://cliniclegal.org/sites/default/files/attachments/daca_sop_4-4-13.pdf (the “DACA SOP”). \n25  18  Id. \n 19  See USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 9 (“[I]f an individual meets the guidelines for DACA, CBP \n26 or ICE should exercise their discretion on a case-by-case basis to prevent qualifying individuals \nfrom being apprehended.”); 2012 DACA Memorandum, at 2; see also Ariz.

These include \n2 Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as driver’s \n3 licenses, health care, financial aid, tuition benefits, and unemployment insurance.21 \n4 30.  DACA also serves as a gateway to numerous other important public and private \n5 practical benefits, and enables recipients to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards, start businesses, \n6 purchase homes and cars, and conduct other aspects of daily life that would otherwise often be \n7 unavailable to them. \n8 31.  DACA also confers certain immigration benefits and the ability to travel abroad.  \n9 For example, DACA recipients do not accrue time under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), and may \n10 briefly depart the U.S. and legally return under certain circumstances.22 \n11 32.  As the government has recognized, DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands of \n12 young people “to enroll in colleges and universities, complete their education, start businesses that \n13 help improve our economy, and give back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, \n14 engineers, and entrepreneurs—all on the books.”23 \n15 The Government’s Promises and Its Efforts to Promote DACA \n16 33.  When the DACA program was first launched, many eligible Dreamers were \n17 understandably reluctant to step forward and voluntarily disclose sensitive personal information \n18 (including their current home address) that could facilitate their removal from the United States and \n19 place their family members at risk.  In response, the government launched an extensive outreach \n20 campaign and vigorously promoted the DACA program.  Among other efforts, the government \n21 provided advice and guidance to civic organizations and education professionals about “best \n22 practices” they could use to encourage eligible individuals to apply for the program.  The \n23 government also hosted informational workshops, and senior government officials—including \n24 President Obama—encouraged young people to apply for the program. \n25\n                                                 \n 21  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3), 1621(d); Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 148 (5th Cir. \n26\n2015); Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 81 F. Supp. 3d 795, 811 (D. Ariz. 2015); see also, e.g., \nCal. Educ. Code §§ 66021.6-66021.7, 68130.5, 76300.5; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22, § 50301.3. \n27\n 22  See USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 57. \n28\n 23  Secretary Johnson Letter, at 2. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  10   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 13 of 46\n \n1 34.  The government reiterated these promises in its official correspondence, vowing \n2 that DACA recipients would not lose their benefits—including the ability to renew their DACA \n3 status—absent specified misconduct.  For example, the approval notice granting deferred action \n4 under DACA lists only “fraud or misrepresentation” in the application process or “[s]ubsequent \n5 criminal activity” as grounds for revoking DACA.24 \n6 35.  The government also made promises about information provided by DACA \n7 recipients as part of its efforts to promote the program.  In particular, since the inception of the \n8 DACA program, the government has repeatedly represented to applicants, Congress, and the general \n9 public that information provided by DACA applicants about themselves or others (including family \n10 members) would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes absent special circumstances. \n11 36.  As then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson explained, “[s]ince DACA \n12 was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants \n13 . . . will not later be used for immigration enforcement purposes except where it is independently \n14 determined that a case involves a national security or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or \n15 limited other circumstances where issuance of a notice to appear is required by law.”25 \n16 37.  Secretary Johnson further explained that this approach was the “long-standing and \n17 consistent practice of DHS (and its predecessor INS)” for many “decades” in the use of information \n18 “submitted by people seeking deferred action” under a wide variety of programs, as well as \n19 applicants seeking immigration “benefits or relief” under a number of other programs.26  According \n20 to Secretary Johnson, “DACA applicants most assuredly relied” upon “these representations” and \n21 the agency’s “consistent practice” stretching back decades.27 \n22 38.  The government’s promise not to use information provided by applicants for \n23 immigration enforcement purposes also appears in the USCIS’s official instructions regarding the \n24 DACA application process.  Those instructions provide: \n25                                                  \n 24  The University of Washington, I-797 DACA Approval Sample, https://registrar.washington.edu/i-\n26 797-daca-approval_sample. \n27  25  Secretary Johnson Letter, at 1. \n 26  Id. at 1–2. \n28\n 27  Id. at 1. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  11   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 14 of 46\n \n1 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure to ICE and U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \n2 proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear \nor a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance \n3 (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be shared with national security and law \nenforcement  agencies,  including  ICE  and  CBP,  for  purposes  other  than  removal, \n4 including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals \nrequest itself, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or \n5 for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above information sharing \nclause covers family members and guardians, in addition to the requestor.28 \n6\n39.  The same promise appears on the DHS website, which states that “[i]nformation \n7\nprovided in this request [for DACA] is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \n8\nimmigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a \n9\nNotice To Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear \n10\nguidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA will not \n11\nbe referred to ICE.”29   \n12\n40.  That same promise is also included in DHS’s official, and statutorily-required, \n13\nPrivacy Impact Assessment for the DACA program.30 \n14\n41.  Numerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced these promises \n15\nand have recognized that Dreamers have relied on the government to keep its word.  For example, in \n16\nDecember 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Charles Johnson acknowledged that there \n17\nare hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who have “relied on the U.S. government’s representations” \n18\nabout DACA, and he asserted that “representations made by the U.S. government, upon which \n19\nDACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored.”31 \n20\n21\n                                                 \n22  28  Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, USCIS Form I-821D at \n13 (Jan. 9, 2017 ed.), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-821dinstr.pdf \n23 (emphasis added). \n24  29  USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 19.

In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the government must \n2 ensure that “the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under” Dreamers, who have “organize[d] [their] \n3 li[ves] around” the DACA program.32 \n4 43.  Also in January 2017, Senator Lindsey Graham stated that the government should \n5 not “pull the rug out and push these young men and women—who came out of the shadows and \n6 registered with the federal government—back into the darkness.”33 \n7 44.  In February 2017, Congressman Raúl Grijalva described DACA as a \n8 “commitment,” and called for “the federal government to honor its word to protect” Dreamers.34 \n9 45.  On February 20, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly issued a \n10 memorandum that “immediately rescinded” all “conflicting directives, memoranda, or field \n11 guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and priorities for removal,” but \n12 specifically exempted the 2012 DACA Memorandum.35 \n13 46.  On March 29, 2017, then-Secretary Kelly reaffirmed that “DACA status” is a \n14 “commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person, or the so-called Dreamer.”36 \n15 47.  On April 21, 2017, President Trump said that his administration is “not after the \n16 dreamers” and suggested that “[t]he dreamers should rest easy.”  When asked if “the policy of [his] \n17 administration [is] to allow the dreamers to stay,” President Trump answered, “Yes.”37 \n18\n                                                 \n19  32  Transcript of CNN Town Hall Meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, CNN (Jan. 12, 2017), \nhttp://cnn.it/2oyJXJJ. \n20\n 33  Lindsey Graham, Graham, Durbin Reintroduce BRIDGE Act To Protect Undocumented Youth \nFrom Deportation (Jan. 12, 2017), \n21\nhttps://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/1/graham-durbin-reintroduce-bridge-act-\n22 to-protect-undocumented-youth-from-deportation. \n 34  Congressional Progressive Caucus Leaders Respond to ICE Arrest of DACA Recipient (Feb. 16, \n23 2017), https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/press-releases/congressional-progressive-caucus-leaders-\nrespond-to-ice-arrest-of-daca-recipient. \n24\n 35  Memorandum from Secretary John Kelly, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the \nNational Interest, at 2 (Feb. 20, 2017), \n25\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of-the-\n26 Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf (hereinafter “Secretary Kelly Memo”).  \n 36  Ted Hesson & Seung Min Kim, Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration, \n27 Politico (Mar. 29, 2017), http://politi.co/2mR3gSN. \n28  37  Transcript of AP Interview With Trump, CBS News (Associated Press) (Apr. 24, 2017), \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-of-ap-interview-with-trump. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  13   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 16 of 46\n \n1 Ms. Garcia Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n2 48.  Dulce Garcia was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was four \n3 years old.  Ms. Garcia was raised in a low-income, underserved neighborhood in San Diego, \n4 California.  Throughout her childhood, Ms. Garcia lacked health care and her family struggled with \n5 poverty and occasional periods of homelessness. \n6 49.  Although she grew up fearing the police and immigration authorities, Ms. Garcia \n7 did not learn that she was undocumented until high school.  Around this time, Ms. Garcia began to \n8 discover the limitations of being undocumented and was advised by her high school guidance \n9 counselor that she would be unable to enroll in college or secure federal financial aid despite her \n10 academic record. \n11 50.  Refusing to yield to these limitations, Ms. Garcia continuously sought to enroll at a \n12 local community college, despite repeatedly being denied admission because of her immigration \n13 status.  Eventually, Ms. Garcia secured admission to the school.  Ms. Garcia later transferred to the \n14 University of California, San Diego (“UCSD”), graduating in 2009 with a bachelor’s degree in \n15 political science and securing honors every quarter she was enrolled at UCSD.  During this time, \n16 Ms. Garcia worked full time as a legal assistant at a small law firm, which solidified her childhood \n17 dream of becoming an attorney, and often sought out second and third jobs in order to pay for tuition \n18 and books. \n19 51.  Ms. Garcia matriculated at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in Cleveland, \n20 Ohio in 2011.  Because tuition was a flat rate regardless of the number of units, Ms. Garcia sought \n21 the Dean’s approval to take extra classes during her second and third years.  Ms. Garcia also worked \n22 throughout law school as legal assistant to cover tuition and her living expenses. \n23 52.  During her last year of law school, when money was especially tight, Ms. Garcia’s \n24 mother gave her $5,000 to help pay for tuition.  This sum represented most of Ms. Garcia’s mother’s \n25 life savings, which she had earned working the night shift as a hotel housekeeper. \n26 53.  During Ms. Garcia’s second year of law school, the government announced the \n27 DACA program.  Ms. Garcia was overjoyed and broke down in tears when she heard the \n28 announcement.  Although she was initially skeptical, Ms. Garcia decided that she could trust the \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  14   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 17 of 46\n \n1 government to honor its promises.  In reliance on the government’s promises, she applied for \n2 DACA, providing the government with her personal information and the required fees.  Ms. Garcia \n3 passed the background check and was granted DACA status in 2014.  In reliance on the \n4 government’s promises, Ms. Garcia successfully reapplied for DACA status and work authorization \n5 in 2016.  Ms. Garcia was admitted to the California Bar in May 2016. \n6 54.  Being granted DACA status was a transformative experience for Ms. Garcia.  \n7 DACA freed Ms. Garcia from the constant worry that she would be detained and deported every \n8 time she stepped outside her home.  It also gave her the confidence to hire several employees, build \n9 a thriving law practice, and represent dozens of clients in immigration, civil litigation, and criminal \n10 defense cases.  Finally, DACA enabled Ms. Garcia to dream about becoming a mother, allowing her \n11 to take the first steps toward becoming a foster parent, with the ultimate goal of adopting a child. \n12 55.  Ms. Garcia trusted the government to honor its promises and advised others that \n13 information provided as part of DACA would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes.  \n14 Even after the new administration was sworn into office, Ms. Garcia continued to trust the \n15 government, helping to create a video encouraging eligible young people to apply for DACA. \n16 Ms. Chabolla Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n17 56.  Viridiana Chabolla was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was \n18 two years old.  Ms. Chabolla grew up in Los Angeles, California.  Ms. Chabolla confronted the \n19 reality of her undocumented status from an early age, and was unable to participate in certain club \n20 and community activities that required a Social Security number.   \n21 57.  Ms. Chabolla was inspired to pursue a career in law by her grandfather, who \n22 suggested that becoming an attorney would give her “the power to fight injustice with words.”  \n23 Ms. Chabolla was further inspired after meeting a Latino judge from East Los Angeles, whose \n24 eloquence, impressive academic credentials, and commitment to the community left a deep \n25 impression on her. \n26 58.  Ms. Chabolla enrolled in Pomona College in the fall of 2009 and graduated with a \n27 Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and Chicana/o-Latina/o Studies in May 2013.  Ms. Chabolla \n28 received numerous honors and awards and was deeply involved in campus life.  At the same time, \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  15   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 18 of 46\n \n1 Ms. Chabolla sought out ways to give back to her community, helping to coordinate academic and \n2 enrichment activities, SAT preparation classes, and college information sessions for hundreds of \n3 students from economically disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds.  Ms. Chabolla also \n4 created and taught an elective course on the U.S. Civil Rights Movement to high school students. \n5 59.  In 2012, during her final year of college, Ms. Chabolla applied for and was granted \n6 DACA status.  In reliance on the promises made by the government, Ms. Chabolla disclosed \n7 personal information about herself and her family, paid the required fee, and submitted to a DHS \n8 background check.  In reliance on the government’s promises, Ms. Chabolla successfully reapplied \n9 for DACA status in 2014 and again in 2016. \n10 60.  After graduating from Pomona, Ms. Chabolla was hired as a community organizer \n11 at Public Counsel, the nation’s largest pro bono law firm.  In that capacity, Ms. Chabolla assisted \n12 with landmark civil rights litigation involving educational inequities in the public education system, \n13 as well as with efforts to provide essential services to homeless veterans, women, and youth in Los \n14 Angeles County. \n15 61.  Ms. Chabolla’s experiences at Public Counsel solidified her interest in helping \n16 underserved individuals and communities obtain justice through the legal system.  In pursuit of this \n17 goal, Ms. Chabolla secured a special fellowship from the law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, \n18 and enrolled earlier this year as a Public Interest Scholar at the University of California, Irvine \n19 School of Law. \n20 Mr. Latthivongskorn Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n21 62.  New Latthivongskorn was brought to the United States from Thailand when he was \n22 nine years old.  Mr. Latthivongskorn was raised in California.  His parents first settled in Fremont, \n23 California, where they worked cleaning toilets and mopping floors, and later waiting tables at \n24 various restaurants.  In 2004, Mr. Latthivongskorn’s parents moved the family to Sacramento to \n25 open their own restaurant, hoping that it would allow them to earn enough money to be able to send \n26 their children to college. \n27 63.  Growing up, Mr. Latthivongskorn lived with the constant fear that he or his parents \n28 might be deported.  Mr. Latthivongskorn began to more acutely experience the challenges of being \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  16   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 19 of 46\n \n1 undocumented as he grew older, often searching for excuses such as being “deathly afraid of \n2 driving” to explain to classmates why he lacked a driver’s license.   \n3 64.  Mr. Latthivongskorn was inspired to become a doctor after his mother was \n4 diagnosed with ovarian tumors during his junior year of high school.  Not only did \n5 Mr. Latthivongskorn witness the incredible power of medicine to help those in need, but he also \n6 experienced the barriers that low-income immigrants face in navigating the health care system.  \n7 After this experience, Mr. Latthivongskorn decided that he wanted to devote his life to improving \n8 access to health care for immigrant and low-income communities. \n9 65.  Mr. Latthivongskorn’s parents taught him that hard work and education were the \n10 keys to success.  In addition to waiting tables, washing dishes, and mopping floors in his family’s \n11 restaurant on nights and weekends, Mr. Latthivongskorn immersed himself in his studies, taking \n12 honors and AP classes.  As a result of his hard work, Mr. Latthivongskorn graduated as salutatorian \n13 of his high school class and was accepted to UC Berkeley.  \n14 66.  Because he lacked a Social Security number, Mr. Latthivongskorn was ineligible for \n15 federal financial aid.  However, due to his record of achievement, Mr. Latthivongskorn was offered \n16 a prestigious scholarship that promised to cover a significant portion of his educational expenses for \n17 four years.  This scholarship was revoked only weeks before classes began after UC Berkeley \n18 learned that Mr. Latthivongskorn lacked legal status.  Mr. Latthivongskorn was devastated and \n19 considered attending a community college, but his family insisted that he enroll at UC Berkeley. \n20 67.  While Mr. Latthivongskorn thrived at UC Berkeley, he constantly worried about \n21 how to finance his education.  To help pay for school, Mr. Latthivongskorn worked as a busboy at a \n22 Thai restaurant and secured scholarships from several nonprofit organizations.  Despite his \n23 demanding academic and work commitments, Mr. Latthivongskorn devoted significant time to \n24 volunteering with several local nonprofit organizations.   \n25 68.  In 2011, Mr. Latthivongskorn was robbed at gun point just five blocks from the UC \n26 Berkeley campus.  He decided not to report the crime to the police out of fear that stepping forward \n27 to law enforcement might lead to him being deported. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  17   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 20 of 46\n \n1 69.  While at UC Berkeley, Mr. Latthivongskorn also developed into an activist and \n2 learned the power of grassroots community organizing.  Among other efforts, Mr. Latthivongskorn \n3 advocated for federal legislation to assist Dreamers, and testified before the California Legislature in \n4 support of the California DREAM Act in 2011 and the California TRUST Act in 2013. \n5 70.  In 2012, Mr. Latthivongskorn co-founded Pre-Health Dreamers (“PHD”), a national \n6 nonprofit organization that provides advising, resources, and advocacy for undocumented students \n7 interested in pursuing careers in health care and science.  In January 2017, Forbes Magazine named \n8 Mr. Latthivongskorn to its “30 Under 30 in Education” list, commending him for being “on the \n9 frontline of getting undocumented students into medical professions and on the path to becoming \n10 physicians and health care professionals.”  \n11 71.  In 2012, Mr. Latthivongskorn graduated with honors from UC Berkeley, earning a \n12 degree in Molecular & Cellular Biology and Distinction in General Scholarship.  In spite of his \n13 excellent academic record, Mr. Latthivongskorn was told by the deans of admissions at several \n14 medical schools that he should not apply to their programs because he was undocumented and that \n15 no medical school would invest their resources in training someone who might not be able to stay in \n16 the United States.  Refusing to take “no” for an answer, Mr. Latthivongskorn applied to medical \n17 school anyway, but was initially turned down. \n18 72.  Exactly one month after Mr. Latthivongskorn graduated from UC Berkeley, the \n19 government announced the DACA program.  Believing that he could rely on the government to \n20 honor its promises, Mr. Latthivongskorn applied for DACA in the fall of 2012.  He passed the \n21 background check and was granted DACA status on January 24, 2013.  In reliance on the \n22 government’s promises, Mr. Latthivongskorn successfully reapplied for DACA status and work \n23 authorization in 2014 and then again in 2016. \n24 73.  Being granted DACA status changed Mr. Latthivongskorn’s life.  Because DACA \n25 recipients were granted permission to stay in the United States on a renewable basis, medical \n26 schools became willing to invest in these students for the several years it takes to complete medical \n27 school and residency programs.  Mr. Latthivongskorn reapplied to medical schools, and in 2014, he \n28 enrolled at UCSF, one of the most prestigious and selective medical schools in the country.  \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  18   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 21 of 46\n \n1 Mr. Latthivongskorn is part of the Program in Medical Education for the Urban Underserved \n2 (“PRIME-US”), and is committed to using his degree to improve health care delivery systems and \n3 assist urban underserved communities.   \n4 74.  In April 2017, Mr. Latthivongskorn was awarded a prestigious U.S. Public Health \n5 Service Excellence in Public Health Award, which is given to medical students who have helped to \n6 advance the U.S. Public Health Service’s mission to “protect, promote, and advance the health and \n7 safety of our Nation.” \n8 75.  In August 2017, Mr. Latthivongskorn began pursuing a Master of Public Health at \n9 Harvard University.  His goal is to develop a better understanding of health care policy so that he \n10 can help to end health disparities and increase access to affordable, quality health care, particularly \n11 for immigrants and other underserved communities. \n12 Ms. Ramirez Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n13 76.  Norma Ramirez was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was five \n14 years old.  Ms. Ramirez attended public high school, where she was an honor roll student.  Her \n15 undocumented status made an impact on her in high school when she was denied a driver’s license \n16 and learned that her dreams of going to college might be out of reach.   \n17 77.  Ms. Ramirez attended the College of Southern Nevada, and later the University of \n18 Nevada, Las Vegas, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology in 2014. \n19 78.  Ms. Ramirez could not believe the news in 2012 when her pastor sent her a text \n20 message telling her about the DACA program.  Relying on the government’s promises under the \n21 DACA program, Ms. Ramirez applied for DACA status on August 15, 2012.  Her application was \n22 approved on November 1, 2012.  In further reliance on the government’s promises, Ms. Ramirez \n23 twice reapplied for DACA status and work authorization, and was reapproved in September 2014 \n24 and October 2016.  \n25 79.  Ms. Ramirez has been inspired to continue her education in clinical psychology in \n26 part because her experiences as a volunteer mentor have exposed her to the suffering of countless \n27 individuals who do not have access to mental health services, much less access to practitioners who \n28 speak their native language or share an understanding of the immigrant experience.  Her motivation \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  19   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 22 of 46\n \n1 also stems from her own difficulties in finding a supportive environment to discuss the challenges \n2 and barriers she has faced as an undocumented immigrant. \n3 80.  In 2015, Ms. Ramirez began her graduate work at the Fuller Theological Seminary \n4 in Pasadena, California.  She earned her Master’s degree in Clinical Psychology in 2017 and is \n5 currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology.  Since 2016, Ms. Ramirez has worked at an \n6 outpatient clinic in Monrovia, California, providing school and home-based therapy to patients in \n7 English and Spanish, and also has served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Immigration \n8 Resource Center of San Gabriel Valley.   \n9 81.  DACA enabled Ms. Ramirez to pursue her dream of establishing a free clinic that \n10 provides mental health services to immigrant youth, Latinos, and their families.  As a Dreamer, \n11 Ms. Ramirez understands the challenges faced by many of her patients, and is able to secure their \n12 trust in a way that many other mental health practitioners cannot. \n13 Ms. Gonzalez Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n14 82.  Miriam Gonzalez was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was six \n15 years old.  She was raised in Los Angeles, California, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in \n16 2011.  \n17 83.  Ms. Gonzalez first learned she was undocumented in the seventh grade, after talking \n18 with her friends about getting a summer job at an elementary school.  When she asked her parents \n19 for her Social Security number so that she could apply to work with her friends, they informed her \n20 that she was undocumented and had no Social Security number. \n21 84.  In spite of their undocumented status, Ms. Gonzalez’s parents pushed her to get \n22 good grades, with the hope that she would go to college.  In high school, Ms. Gonzalez began telling \n23 her teachers that she was undocumented, and they provided her with resources about the application \n24 process and about a California law allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition. \n25 85.  Relying on the government’s promises under the DACA program, Ms. Gonzalez \n26 applied for DACA status and work authorization in December 2012.  Her application was approved \n27 in February 2013.  In further reliance on the government’s promises, Ms. Gonzalez successfully \n28 reapplied for DACA status and work authorization in December 2014 and October 2016. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  20   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 23 of 46\n \n1 86.  Ms. Gonzalez attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles \n2 (“UCLA”), graduating in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology and a minor in Classical \n3 Civilizations.  She was named to the Dean’s Honors List for her academic performance in the spring \n4 of 2015.  While at UCLA, Ms. Gonzalez earned money by tutoring elementary, middle, and high \n5 school students, and by working as a campus parking assistant. \n6 87.  Ms. Gonzalez has been active in community service since a young age, focusing her \n7 energy on immigrants’ rights and education for the underserved.  While at UCLA, she helped to host \n8 the 2014 Immigrant Youth Empowerment Conference—the largest immigrant youth conference in \n9 the country—as well as an Educators Conference, a DACA clinic, and several additional \n10 immigrants’ rights workshops.  Ms. Gonzalez also mentored two students at Van Nuys High School, \n11 motivating them to pursue a higher education and advising them on the college application process. \n12 88.  Ms. Gonzalez ultimately decided that she could give the most to her community by \n13 teaching students in underserved communities.  After graduating from UCLA in 2016, \n14 Ms. Gonzalez was accepted into the selective Teach For America (“TFA”) program.  Through TFA, \n15 Ms. Gonzalez currently teaches Math and Reading Intervention to struggling middle school students \n16 at Crown Preparatory Academy in Los Angeles. \n17 89.  In 2017, Ms. Gonzalez received her Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching \n18 Credential from Loyola Marymount University, which is valid until 2022.  Ms. Gonzalez is \n19 currently studying at Loyola Marymount to obtain a Master of Arts degree in Urban Education, with \n20 a focus in Policy and Administration.  Upon her expected completion of her master’s program and \n21 her service with TFA in the spring of 2018, Ms. Gonzalez hopes to continue to teach in the Los \n22 Angeles area, mentoring and inspiring young students from disadvantaged communities to pursue a \n23 higher education and achieve their full potential. \n24 Mr. Jimenez Relied on the Government’s Promises Regarding DACA \n25 90.  Saul Jimenez was brought to the United States from Mexico when he was one year \n26 old.  Mr. Jimenez was raised in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.  He \n27 attended Roosevelt High School, where he was a star athlete.  Among other achievements, he was \n28 captain of the football team and an all-league wide receiver.  Mr. Jimenez worked throughout high \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  21   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 24 of 46\n \n1 school, helping his parents make ends meet by delivering newspapers and washing dishes at an \n2 Italian restaurant. \n3 91.  Following high school, Mr. Jimenez played football for two years at East Los \n4 Angeles Community College, viewing his commitment to the game as a ticket to a four-year \n5 university.  At the same time, Mr. Jimenez was also working two or three jobs, and often struggled \n6 to stay awake during practice and team meetings.  Mr. Jimenez explored becoming a firefighter and \n7 considered a career in law enforcement, but learned that his legal status prevented him from serving \n8 his community in these ways. \n9 92.  In 2007, Mr. Jimenez’s hard work paid off and he was awarded a football \n10 scholarship to Oklahoma Panhandle State University.  Mr. Jimenez again served as team captain and \n11 was chosen by his teammates as defensive MVP—now playing as an outside linebacker.   \n12 93.  In Oklahoma, Mr. Jimenez began mentoring high school students through the U.S. \n13 Department of Education’s Upward Bound program.  Mr. Jimenez quickly found that he enjoyed \n14 working with young people and was able to connect with and help many of his students. \n15 94.  In 2010, Mr. Jimenez returned to Boyle Heights, working in low-wage jobs in \n16 warehouses and restaurants to support his parents and himself.  However, after the government \n17 announced the DACA program in 2012, Mr. Jimenez began to believe that he could build a career \n18 for himself, and worked to improve his resume.  \n19 95.  Relying on the government’s promises under the DACA program, Mr. Jimenez \n20 successfully applied for DACA status in 2012.  In further reliance on the government’s promises, \n21 Mr. Jimenez successfully reapplied for DACA status and work authorization in 2014. \n22 96.  Shortly after receiving DACA status, Mr. Jimenez secured three part-time teaching \n23 and mentorship positions, working as a tutor, a sports coach in an after-school program, and as a \n24 manager at an adolescent rehabilitation center at night.  After a few months, Mr. Jimenez accepted a \n25 full-time position as a program coordinator with the national nonprofit HealthCorps, which enabled \n26 him to continue to pursue his interest in teaching and mentorship. \n27 97.  In August 2016, Mr. Jimenez began working as a substitute teacher in the Los \n28 Angeles Unified School District.  Mr. Jimenez is now a full-time special education teacher at \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  22   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 25 of 46\n \n1 Stevenson Middle School, where he helps students with learning disabilities overcome their \n2 challenges. \n3 98.  Mr. Jimenez has also pursued coaching as a further means to inspire and uplift \n4 young people.  In recent years, Mr. Jimenez has also served as the head junior varsity football coach, \n5 the head girls junior varsity soccer coach, and an assistant varsity football coach at Roosevelt High \n6 School.  Through coaching, Mr. Jimenez seeks to teach young people skills and lessons that will \n7 apply broadly and benefit them throughout their lives. \n8 President Trump’s Statements and Actions Prior to Ending DACA \n9 99.  The government’s decision to end the DACA program was motivated by improper \n10 discriminatory intent and animus toward Mexican nationals, individuals of Mexican heritage, and \n11 Latinos, who together account for 93 percent of approved DACA applications. \n12 100.  According to USCIS, approximately 79 percent of approved DACA applications \n13 through March 31, 2017, have been submitted by Mexican nationals.38  No other nationality makes \n14 up more than 4 percent of approved DACA applications.39  93 percent of approved DACA \n15 applications have been submitted by individuals from Latin American countries.40   \n16 101.  President Trump’s statements and actions reflect a pattern of bias against Mexicans \n17 and Latinos.  For example, on February 24, 2015, President Trump demanded that Mexico “stop \n18 sending criminals over our border.”41  On March 5, 2015, President Trump tweeted that he \n19 “want[ed] nothing to do with Mexico other than to build an impenetrable WALL . . . .”42 \n20\n21\n22\n                                                 \n23\n 38  USCIS, Form I-821D Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Fiscal Year, \nQuarter, Intake, Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (Mar. 31, 2017), \n24\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigrati\non%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performancedata_fy2017_qtr2.pdf. \n25\n 39  Id. \n26\n 40  Id. \n27  41  Donald J.

On June 16, 2015, during his speech launching his presidential campaign, President \n2 Trump characterized immigrants from Mexico as criminals, “rapists,” and “people that have lots of \n3 problems.”43  President Trump later asserted that these remarks were “100 percent correct.”44 \n4 103.  Three days later, President Trump tweeted that “[d]ruggies, drug dealers, rapists and \n5 killers are coming across the southern border,” and asked, “When will the U.S. get smart and stop \n6 this travesty?”45 \n7 104.  On August 6, 2015, during the first Republican presidential debate, President Trump \n8 said “the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.  And they send \n9 the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them, they don’t want to take care of them.”46 \n10 105.  On August 21, 2015, two men urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then beat him \n11 with a metal pole.  At the police station, they stated “Donald Trump was right; all these illegals need \n12 to be deported.”  When asked about the incident, President Trump failed to condemn the men, \n13 instead stating that they were “passionate.”  Specifically, President Trump said, “[i]t would be a \n14 shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate.  They love this country \n15 and they want this country to be great again.  They are passionate.”47  \n16 106.  On August 24, 2015, President Trump tweeted, “Jeb Bush is crazy, who cares that \n17 he speaks Mexican, this is America, English!!”48   \n18\n19                                                  \n 43  Donald J.

On September 25, 2015, President Trump suggested that the United States would no \n2 longer “take care” of “anchor babies” from Mexico.49 \n3 108.  In May and June 2016, President Trump repeatedly attacked United States District \n4 Judge Gonzalo Curiel, asserting that because he was “of Mexican heritage” he had “an absolute” \n5 and “inherent conflict of interest” that precluded him from hearing a lawsuit against President \n6 Trump’s eponymous university.50  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan characterized President Trump’s \n7 comments as “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”51  Senator Susan Collins similarly \n8 asserted that President Trump’s “statement that Judge Curiel could not rule fairly because of his \n9 Mexican heritage” was “absolutely unacceptable.”52 \n10 109.  On August 31, 2016, President Trump raised concerns about immigrants, saying \n11 “we have no idea who these people are, where they come from.  I always say Trojan Horse.”53   \n12 110.  In August 2017, President Trump asserted that a group of white supremacists \n13 marching in Charlottesville, Virginia included “some very fine people.”54  Former Massachusetts \n14 Governor Mitt Romney suggested that these comments “caused racists to rejoice,”55 while Senator \n15 Lindsay Graham noted that the President was “now receiving praise from some of the most racist \n16\n                                                 \n 49  Donald J.

On August 22, 2017, during a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, President Trump described \n4 unauthorized immigrants as “animals” who bring “the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of \n5 smuggling and trafficking.”58 \n6 112.  On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff \n7 Joseph Arpaio, who had been convicted of criminal contempt by United States District Judge Susan \n8 R. Bolton for intentionally disobeying a federal court order to cease targeting Latinos.  A \n9 comprehensive investigation by the United States Department of Justice found that under Sheriff \n10 Arpaio’s leadership the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office engaged in a pattern and practice of \n11 unconstitutional conduct and violations of federal law based on its blatantly discriminatory practices \n12 against Latinos.59  Among other conclusions, the Justice Department investigation uncovered “a \n13 pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos” and noted that Sheriff Arpaio’s officers \n14 routinely referred to Latinos as “wetbacks,” “Mexican bitches,” “fucking Mexicans,” and “stupid \n15 Mexicans.”  In pardoning Sheriff Arpaio, President Trump praised him as an “American patriot”60 \n16 and suggested that he was “convicted for doing his job.”61 \n17\n18\n                                                 \n19  56  Eugene Scott & Miranda Green, Trump, Graham feud over President’s Charlottesville response, \nCNN Politics (Aug. 17, 2017), http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/lindsey-graham-donald-\n20 trump-charlottesville/index.html. \n 57  Z.

President Trump’s recent comments and actions reflect an ongoing pattern and \n2 practice of bias stretching back decades.  In 1973, the United States Department of Justice sued \n3 President Trump after a federal investigation found that his company had engaged in systematic \n4 racial discrimination.  To settle this lawsuit, President Trump agreed to a settlement in which he \n5 promised not to discriminate further against people of color.62 \n6 The Termination of the DACA Program \n7 114.  Throughout the first eight months of 2017, the Trump Administration sent strong \n8 signals that Dreamers could and should continue to rely on the government’s promises regarding the \n9 DACA program.  As noted above, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John D. Kelly specifically \n10 exempted DACA from the Administration’s broad repeal of other immigration programs, and \n11 reaffirmed that DACA status is a “commitment” by the government.63  On April 21, 2017, President \n12 Trump said that his administration is “not after the dreamers,” suggested that “[t]he dreamers should \n13 rest easy,” and responded to the question of whether “the policy of [his] administration [is] to allow \n14 the dreamers to stay,” by answering “Yes.”64 \n15 115.  On June 29, 2017, officials from ten states65 that had previously challenged another \n16 deferred action program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent \n17 Residents (“DAPA”), sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asserting that the DACA \n18\n19                                                  \n 62  Michael Kranish & Robert O’Harrow, Jr., Inside the government’s racial bias case against \n20 Donald Trump’s company, and how he fought it, The Washington Post (Jan. 23, 2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-\n21 donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-\n62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.b640592cbc5a. \n22\n 63  Secretary Kelly Memo, supra note 35; Hesson & Kim, supra note 36. \n23  64  Transcript of AP Interview With Trump, supra note 37. \n24  65  On September 1, 2017, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H.

Attorney General Slattery further acknowledged that DACA recipients “have an \nappreciation for the opportunities afforded them by our country,” and that “[m]any . . . have \n27\noutstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit \n28 and service” to the United States.

The states threatened to challenge DACA in court unless the federal \n2 government rescinded the DACA program by September 5, 2017.66 \n3 116.  On July 21, 2017, attorneys general from twenty states sent a letter to President \n4 Trump urging him to maintain DACA and defend the program in court, asserting that the arguments \n5 of the states which were threatening to bring suit were “wrong as a matter of law and policy.”67 \n6 117.  On August 31, 2017, hundreds of America’s leading business executives sent a \n7 letter to President Trump urging him to preserve the DACA program.68  The letter explains that \n8 “Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy” and are part of America’s \n9 “global competitive advantage.”69 \n10 118.  On September 4, 2017, Attorney General Sessions wrote to Acting Secretary of \n11 Homeland Security Duke, describing his assessment that “DACA was effectuated by the previous \n12 administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority;” that DACA “was an \n13 unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch;” and that “it is likely that potentially \n14 imminent litigation would yield similar results [as the DAPA litigation] with respect to DACA.”70 \n15 119.  On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Sessions announced the government’s \n16 decision to end the DACA program.  In his remarks, Attorney General Sessions recognized that \n17 DACA “essentially provided a legal status for recipients for a renewable two-year term, work \n18 authorization and other benefits, including participation in the social security program,” but asserted \n19\n20\n                                                 \n21\n 66  Letter from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, et al., to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions \n22 (June 29, 2017), https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/DACA_letter_6_29_2017.pdf. \n 67  Letter from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, et al., to President Donald J.

Sessions to Acting Secretary of Homeland \n27\nSecurity Elaine C. Duke (Sept. 4, 2017), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0904_DOJ_AG-letter-DACA.pdf. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  28   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 31 of 46\n \n1 that the program “is vulnerable to the same legal and constitutional challenges that the courts \n2 recognized with respect to the DAPA program.”71   \n3 120.  Attorney General Sessions’s comments regarding the legality of the DACA program \n4 contradict conclusions previously reached by both the Department of Justice and the Department of \n5 Homeland Security.  Specifically, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”) \n6 provided a detailed analysis of DAPA in 2014, concluding that DAPA—as well as DACA—was a \n7 lawful exercise of the Executive Branch’s “discretion to enforce the immigration laws.”72  More \n8 recently, in its brief before the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Texas, DHS concluded that \n9 programs like DACA are “lawful exercise[s]” of the Executive Branch’s “broad statutory authority” \n10 to administer and enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.73 \n11 121.  Nonetheless, on the same date as Attorney General Sessions’s announcement, \n12 Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke issued a memorandum formally rescinding the DACA \n13 program (the “Rescission Memorandum”).74  Unlike OLC’s 2014 analysis, the Rescission \n14 Memorandum provides no reasoned evaluation of the legality and merits of the program.  Instead, it \n15 states that the threat of litigation by numerous state attorneys general provoked the decision to \n16 terminate DACA. \n17 122.  In addition to the Rescission Memorandum, Secretary Duke also issued an \n18 accompanying statement asserting that the government had decided to end DACA rather than “allow \n19 the judiciary to potentially shut the program down completely and immediately.”75  Secretary Duke \n                                                 \n20\n 71  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Pub.

Under the Rescission Memorandum, the federal government will continue to \n4 process DACA applications received by September 5, 2017.  Furthermore, the federal government \n5 will issue renewals for recipients whose permits expire before March 5, 2018, provided they apply \n6 for renewal by October 5, 2017.  The government will not approve any new or pending applications \n7 for advanced parole. \n8 124.  In a statement also issued on September 5, 2017, President Trump claimed that he \n9 decided to end DACA because he had been advised that “the program is unlawful and \n10 unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court,” and because DACA “helped spur a \n11 humanitarian crisis—the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America including, \n12 in some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout our country, \n13 such as MS-13.”77 \n14 125.  The government also has taken affirmative steps to reduce the protections applicable \n15 to information provided in connection with the DACA program.  In January 2017, President Trump \n16 issued an Executive Order directing all agencies, including DHS, to “ensure that their privacy \n17 policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the \n18 protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.”78  DHS has confirmed \n19 that its new privacy policy “permits the sharing of information about immigrants and non-\n20 immigrants with federal, state, and local law enforcement.”79 \n21\n22\n                                                 \n23  76  Id. \n 77  Statement from President Donald J.

The Rescission Memorandum also provides no assurance that information provided \n2 in connection with DACA applications or renewal requests will not be used for immigration \n3 enforcement purposes.  To the contrary, DHS posted public guidance about the impact of the \n4 rescission on the same day that the Rescission Memorandum was issued.  This guidance backtracks \n5 on the government’s prior repeated assurances that “[i]nformation provided in [a DACA] request is \n6 protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings \n7 . . . .”80  Now, rather than affirmatively “protect[ing] [this information] from disclosure,” the \n8 government represents only that such sensitive information “will not be proactively provided to ICE \n9 and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings . . . .”81  And even this policy \n10 “may not be relied upon” by any party and can be changed “at any time without notice.”82   \n11 127.  Despite terminating DACA, other uses of deferred action and programs benefitting \n12 other groups of immigrants remain in effect. \n13 The Termination of the DACA Program Will Inflict Severe Harm \n14 128.  The termination of the DACA program will severely harm Plaintiffs and hundreds \n15 of thousands of other young Dreamers.  Among other things, Plaintiffs stand to lose their ability to \n16 access numerous federal, state, and practical benefits, and to reside in the United States with their \n17 families.  Nearly 800,000 other young people will similarly face the prospect of losing their jobs, \n18 being denied vital benefits, and being separated from the family, friends, colleagues, and \n19 communities that love and rely on them.  The termination of the DACA program will also harm the \n20 students, patients, clients, community members, family, and friends who have come to rely on \n21 Plaintiffs for essential services and emotional and financial support. \n22\n23\n                                                 \n24  80  USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 19 (emphasis added).  The referenced Notice to Appearance \nguidance is USCIS Policy Memorandum 602-0050 (Nov. 7, 2011) (“Revised Guidance for the \nReferral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and \n25\nRemovable Aliens”). \n26  81  DHS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \n(Sept. 5, 2017) (emphasis added), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/frequently-asked-\n27 questions-rescission-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca. \n28  82  Id. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  31   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 34 of 46\n \n1 129.  With the sensitive personal information they provided to the federal government no \n2 longer “protected from disclosure,” Plaintiffs and other DACA recipients face the imminent risk that \n3 such information could be used against them “at any time,” “without notice,” for purposes of \n4 immigration enforcement, including detention or deportation. \n5 130.  Terminating DACA will also cause widespread economic harm.83  DACA has \n6 enabled approximately 800,000 hardworking, ambitious, and educated young people to enter the \n7 labor force.  Over 90 percent of DACA recipients are employed, and over 95 percent are bilingual, a \n8 valuable skill that is increasingly needed by American companies.84 \n9 131.  Terminating the DACA program will also have a negative impact on the economy \n10 and American competitiveness.85   \n11 132.  On August 31, 2017, in recognition of these costs and their concern for Dreamers, \n12 hundreds of America’s most important business leaders sent a letter to President Trump emphasizing \n13 the benefits of the DACA program and urging him to preserve it.  The letter explains that “Dreamers \n14 are vital to the future of our companies and our economy” and part of America’s “global \n15 competitive advantage.”86 \n16 CAUSES OF ACTION \n17 FIRST COUNT \n18 FIFTH AMENDMENT – DUE PROCESS \n19 133.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n20 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n21\n22                                                  \n 83  See, e.g., Ike Brannon & Logan Albright, The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Repealing DACA, \n23 The Cato Institute (Jan. 18, 2017), https://www.cato.org/blog/economic-fiscal-impact-repealing-\ndaca; Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Money on the Table: The Economic Cost of Ending \n24 DACA (Dec. 2016), https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/2016-12-13_ilrc_report_-\n_money_on_the_table_economic_costs_of_ending_daca.pdf. \n25\n 84  Id. \n26  85  See Ike Brannon & Logan Albright, supra note 83 (concluding that terminating DACA will cost \nthe federal government $60 billion in lost revenue and reduce GDP by $215 billion). \n27\n 86  Letter to President Donald J.

Immigrants who are physically present in the United States are guaranteed the \n2 protections of the Due Process Clause.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).   \n3 135.  The Constitution “imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive \n4 individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the \n5 Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).  A threshold \n6 inquiry in any case involving a violation of procedural due process “is whether the plaintiffs have a \n7 protected property or liberty interest and, if so, the extent or scope of that interest.”  Nozzi v. Hous. \n8 Auth. of L.A., 806 F.3d 1178, 1190–91 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, \n9 408 U.S. 564, 569–70 (1972)).  \n10 136.  The property interests protected by the Due Process Clause “extend beyond tangible \n11 property and include anything to which a plaintiff has a ‘legitimate claim of entitlement.’”  Nozzi, \n12 806 F.3d at 1191 (quoting Roth, 408 U.S. at 576–77).  “A legitimate claim of entitlement is created \n13 [by] . . . ‘rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to \n14 those benefits.’”  Id. (quoting Roth, 408 U.S. at 577). \n15 137.  In addition to freedom from detention, Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690, the term “liberty” \n16 also encompasses the ability to work, raise a family, and “form the other enduring attachments of \n17 normal life.”  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 572). \n18 138.  DACA recipients, including Plaintiffs, have constitutionally protected liberty and \n19 property interests in their DACA status and the numerous benefits conferred thereunder, including \n20 the ability to renew their DACA status every two years.  These protected interests exist by virtue of \n21 the government’s decision to grant DACA recipients certain benefits and its repeated representations \n22 and promises regarding the DACA program.  See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262 (1970); Perry \n23 v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972) (“A person’s interest in a benefit is a ‘property’ interest for \n24 due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim \n25 of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing.”). \n26 139.  In establishing and continuously operating DACA under a well-defined framework \n27 of highly specific criteria—including nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for managing the \n28 program—the government created a reasonable expectation among Plaintiffs and other DACA \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  33   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 36 of 46\n \n1 recipients that they are entitled to the benefits provided under the program, including the ability to \n2 seek renewal of their DACA status, as long as they continue to play by the rules and meet the \n3 program’s nondiscretionary criteria for renewal. \n4 140.  DACA status is uniquely valuable to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers in that it serves \n5 as a gateway to numerous essential benefits.  Revocation of DACA effectively deprives these young \n6 people of the ability to be fully contributing members of society. \n7 141.  The ability to renew DACA status at regular intervals has always been an essential \n8 element of the program and part of the deal offered by the government.  The prospect of renewal was \n9 one of the primary benefits the government used to induce Plaintiffs and other Dreamers to step \n10 forward, disclose highly sensitive personal information, and subject themselves to a rigorous \n11 background investigation. \n12 142.  The government’s arbitrary termination of the DACA program and deprivation of \n13 the opportunity to renew DACA status violates the due process rights of Plaintiffs and other DACA \n14 recipients. \n15 143.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA after vigorously promoting the \n16 program and coaxing hundreds of thousands of highly vulnerable young people to step forward is an \n17 unconstitutional bait-and-switch.  See, e.g., Cox v. State of La., 379 U.S. 559, 571 (1965); Raley v. \n18 State of Ohio, 360 U.S. 423, 438–39 (1959).  The government promised Plaintiffs and other young \n19 people that if they disclosed highly sensitive personal information, passed a background check, and \n20 played by the rules, they would be able to live and work in the United States.  The government’s \n21 termination of the DACA program is a breach of that promise.  For the government to now “say . . . \n22 ‘The joke is on you.  You shouldn’t have trusted us,’ is hardly worthy of our great government.”  \n23 Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, 130 Fed. Cl. 436, 466 (Fed. Cl. 2017) (quoting Brandt v. \n24 Hickel, 427 F.2d 53, 57 (9th Cir. 1970)). \n25 144.  The Due Process Clause also forbids the government from breaking its promises, \n26 especially where, as here, individuals, have been induced to undertake actions with potentially \n27 devastating consequences in reliance on those promises. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  34   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 37 of 46\n \n1 145.  The use of information provided by Plaintiffs and other DACA applicants for \n2 immigration enforcement actions has particularly egregious due process implications.  These \n3 individuals disclosed sensitive personal information in reliance on the government’s explicit and \n4 repeated assurances that it would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes and would in \n5 fact be “protected from disclosure” to ICE and CBP.  The government has already violated its \n6 promises regarding DACA, and there is little reason to believe it will not similarly breach its \n7 representations regarding information sharing.  Cf. Raley, 360 U.S. at 438 (“convicting a citizen for \n8 exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him,” was the “most \n9 indefensible sort of entrapment by the State”).  Indeed, the government already has breached its prior \n10 commitments to affirmatively “protect[] [sensitive information] from disclosure,” now asserting only \n11 that it will not “proactively provide[]” such information to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \n12 immigration enforcement proceedings. \n13 146.  The Due Process Clause also requires that the federal government’s immigration \n14 enforcement actions be fundamentally fair.  Here, the government’s arbitrary decisions to terminate \n15 DACA and change the policy regarding the use of information provided by DACA applicants are \n16 fundamentally unfair. \n17 147.  Defendants’ violations of the Due Process Clause have harmed Plaintiffs and will \n18 continue to cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n19 SECOND COUNT \n20 FIFTH AMENDMENT – EQUAL PROTECTION \n21 148.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n22 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n23 149.  The Fifth Amendment forbids federal officials from acting with a discriminatory \n24 intent or purpose.  See United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2695 (2013); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 \n25 U.S. 497, 500 (1954). \n26 150.  To succeed on an equal protection claim, plaintiffs must show that the defendants \n27 “discriminated against them as members of an identifiable class and that the discrimination was \n28 intentional.”  Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified Sch. Dist., 324 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  35   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 38 of 46\n \n1 omitted).  “Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a \n2 sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”  Vill. of \n3 Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977).  “The court analyzes \n4 whether a discriminatory purpose motivated the defendant by examining the events leading up to the \n5 challenged decision and the legislative history behind it, the defendant’s departure from normal \n6 procedures or substantive conclusions, and the historical background of the decision and whether it \n7 creates a disparate impact.”  Avenue 6E Invs., LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504 (9th Cir. \n8 2016). \n9 151.  As set forth above, the termination of DACA was motivated by improper \n10 discriminatory intent and bias against Mexican nationals, individuals of Mexican descent, and \n11 Latinos, who together account for 93 percent of approved DACA applications. \n12 152.  President Trump has a history of tweets, campaign speeches, debate responses, and \n13 other statements alleging that Mexican and Latino immigrants are rapists, criminals, and otherwise \n14 bad people.  Moreover, shortly before terminating DACA, President Trump pardoned former \n15 Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for a criminal contempt of court conviction related to Sheriff \n16 Arpaio’s discriminatory practices against Latinos, asserting that the Sheriff had been convicted of \n17 contempt merely for “doing his job.” \n18 153.  President Trump’s statements and actions, including the termination of the DACA \n19 program, appealed to voters who harbor hostility toward Mexican and Latino immigrants.  \n20 154.  The government did not follow its normal procedures in reversing course and \n21 terminating the DACA program.  In 2014, the OLC concluded, after conducting a detailed analysis, \n22 that DACA was a lawful exercise of the Executive Branch’s discretion.  The government has made \n23 similar arguments to the Supreme Court.  By contrast, Attorney General Sessions’s one-page letter \n24 to Acting Secretary Duke contained virtually no legal analysis, and Acting Secretary Duke’s \n25 Rescission Memorandum relied largely on Attorney General Sessions’s letter. \n26 155.  There are many strong policy reasons to maintain the DACA program.  DACA has \n27 provided the government with enormous benefits, including an efficient allocation of immigration \n28 enforcement resources.  DACA has also provided enormous benefits to American businesses and the \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  36   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 39 of 46\n \n1 broader economy.  And DACA has helped communities throughout the United States, who are able \n2 to benefit from the talents and contributions of DACA recipients. \n3 156.  DACA is a promise from the government to DACA recipients and those who rely \n4 on them.  Separate from the policy rationales set forth above, the government is obligated to honor \n5 its commitments under the DACA program. \n6 157.  The government continues to operate programs that benefit other groups of \n7 immigrants.  Because Mexicans and Latinos account for 93 percent of approved DACA \n8 applications, they will be disproportionately impacted by the termination of the DACA program. \n9 158.  The history, procedure, substance, context, and impact of the decision to terminate \n10 DACA demonstrate that the decision was motivated by discriminatory animus against Mexican and \n11 Latino immigrants.  Because it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, the decision to terminate \n12 DACA violates the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n13 159.  Defendants’ violations have caused ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \n14 THIRD COUNT \n15 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS \n16 160.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n17 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n18 161.  Defendants are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  See 5 U.S.C. \n19 § 703.  The termination of the DACA program is final agency action subject to judicial review \n20 because it marks the “consummation of the . . . decisionmaking process” and is one “from which \n21 legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks \n22 omitted). \n23 162.  The  “comprehensive” scope of the APA provides a “default” “remed[y] for all \n24 interactions between individuals and all federal agencies.”  W. Radio Servs. Co. v. U.S. Forest Serv., \n25 578 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir. 2009). \n26 163.  The APA requires that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n27 findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law . . . [or] contrary to \n28 constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B). \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  37   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 40 of 46\n \n1 164.  For the reasons set forth above, the decision to terminate the DACA program is \n2 unconstitutional in numerous respects and therefore must be vacated. \n3 FOURTH COUNT \n4 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION \n5 165.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n6 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n7 166.  Defendants are subject to the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 703.  The termination of the \n8 DACA program is final agency action subject to judicial review because it marks the “consummation \n9 of the . . . decisionmaking process” and is one “from which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett, \n10 520 U.S. at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n11 167.  The “comprehensive” scope of the APA provides a “default” “remed[y] for all \n12 interactions between individuals and all federal agencies.”  W. Radio Servs. Co., 578 F.3d at 1123. \n13 168.  The APA requires that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n14 findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n15 not in accordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n16 § 706(2)(A), (E). \n17 169.  In creating DACA, the government promised Plaintiffs that if they stepped forward, \n18 shared highly sensitive personal information, and passed a background check, they would be granted \n19 renewable protection and would be allowed to live and work in the United States as long as they \n20 played by the rules.  The government also specifically and consistently promised that information \n21 disclosed through the DACA program would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes \n22 outside certain limited circumstances. \n23 170.  Plaintiffs and nearly 800,000 vulnerable young people reasonably relied on the \n24 government’s assurances and promises in taking the irreversible step of identifying themselves and \n25 providing the government with highly sensitive and potentially compromising personal information.  \n26 DACA recipients also made numerous life-altering personal and professional decisions in reliance on \n27 the government’s promises regarding DACA. \n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  38   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 41 of 46\n \n1 171.  A government decision reversing a prior policy is “arbitrary and capricious” when it \n2 fails “tak[e] into account” these types of “serious reliance interests.”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, \n3 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1209 (2015). \n4 172.  The government’s disregard for the reasonable reliance of Plaintiffs and hundreds of \n5 thousands of other vulnerable young people is the hallmark of arbitrary and capricious action and an \n6 abuse of discretion, and the decision to terminate the DACA program is therefore in violation of the \n7 APA and must be vacated. \n8 173.  The government’s decision to terminate the DACA program is also arbitrary and \n9 capricious because the purported rationale for that decision is inconsistent with DHS’s new \n10 policy.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n11 55–56 (1983) (holding that the agency “failed to offer the rational connection between facts and \n12 judgment required to pass muster under the arbitrary capricious standard”).  In particular, the \n13 government terminated DACA because it purportedly concluded that the Executive Branch lacks \n14 authority to continue the program, yet DHS will continue to adjudicate pending DACA applications, \n15 as well as renewal applications it receives before October 5, 2017 (for individuals whose benefits \n16 expire before March 5, 2018), thereby extending DACA for an additional two and a half years. \n17 174.  The government’s decision to set an October 5, 2017 deadline for accepting DACA \n18 renewal applications is also arbitrary.  The Rescission Memorandum does not provide a reasoned \n19 analysis to support this short deadline, and the government has failed to provide sufficient time and \n20 notice to DACA recipients.  On information and belief, the government has sent false and misleading \n21 renewal notices to certain DACA recipients, which have failed to advise them of the October 5, 2017 \n22 deadline.  Moreover, this short deadline is especially troubling for low-income DACA recipients, \n23 who have little time to gather the significant funds required to submit a DACA renewal application. \n24 175.  Moreover, the decision to terminate DACA is also arbitrary and capricious because \n25 the government itself previously determined that DACA is a lawful exercise of the Executive \n26 Branch’s immigration enforcement authority, and the government failed to conduct or provide a \n27 reasoned analysis for its change of policy.  See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Burford, 871 F.2d 849, 855 \n28 (9th Cir. 1989) (“a shift from settled policy requires a showing of reasoned analysis”). \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  39   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 42 of 46\n \n1 176.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA is also in violation of the APA \n2 because the stated rationale for ending the program is pretextual and incorrect as a matter of law. \n3 FIFTH COUNT \n4 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – NOTICE-AND-COMMENT RULEMAKING \n5 177.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n6 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n7 178.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D), requires that federal agencies conduct \n8 rulemaking before engaging in action that impacts substantive rights.   \n9 179.  DHS is an “agency” under the APA, and the Rescission Memorandum and the \n10 actions that DHS has taken to implement the Rescission Memorandum are “rules” under the APA.  \n11 See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), (4).  \n12 180.  In implementing the Rescission Memorandum, federal agencies have changed the \n13 substantive criteria by which individual DACA grantees work, live, attend school, obtain credit, and \n14 travel in the United States.  Defendants did not follow the procedures required by the APA before \n15 taking action impacting these substantive rights.  \n16 181.  With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency rules must go through notice-\n17 and-comment rulemaking.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553.  \n18 182.  Defendants promulgated and implemented these rules without authority and without \n19 notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation of the APA.  \n20 183.  Plaintiffs will be impacted because they have not had the opportunity to comment on \n21 the rescission of DACA.  \n22 184.  Defendants’ violation has caused ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \n23 SIXTH COUNT \n24 REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT – REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSES \n25 185.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n26 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n27\n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  40   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 43 of 46\n \n1 186.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601–12 (“RFA”), requires federal \n2 agencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and final \n3 versions of those analyses for public comment.  5 U.S.C. §§ 603–04.  \n4 187.  “Small entit[ies]” for purposes of the RFA includes “small organization[s]” and \n5 “small business[es].”  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 601(3), (4), (6).  \n6 188.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \n7 under the RFA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 601(2).  \n8 189.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules.  \n9 190.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \n10 violates the RFA and is unlawful. \n11 191.  Defendants’ violations cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \n12 SEVENTH COUNT \n13 EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL \n14 192.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n15 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n16 193.  Through its conduct and statements, the government represented to Plaintiffs and \n17 other DACA applicants that DACA was lawful and that information collected in connection with the \n18 DACA program would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes absent special \n19 circumstances. \n20 194.  In reliance on the government’s repeated assurances, Plaintiffs and other DACA \n21 applicants risked removal and deportation and came forward and identified themselves to the \n22 government, and provided sensitive personal information, including their fingerprints and personal \n23 history, in order to participate in DACA. \n24 195.  Throughout the life of DACA, the government has continued to make affirmative \n25 representations about the use of information as well as the validity and legality of DACA.  Plaintiffs \n26 and other DACA applicants relied on the government’s continuing representations to their detriment. \n27\n28\nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  41   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 44 of 46\n \n1 196.  DACA beneficiaries rearranged their lives to become fully visible and contributing \n2 members of society, including by seeking employment, pursuing higher education, and paying taxes, \n3 but are now at real risk of removal and deportation. \n4 197.  Accordingly, Defendants should be equitably estopped from terminating the DACA \n5 program or from using information provided pursuant to DACA for immigration enforcement \n6 purposes, except as previously authorized under DACA. \n7 198.  An actual controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendants exists as to whether \n8 Defendants should be equitably estopped. \n9 199.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendants are equitably estopped. \n10 EIGHTH COUNT \n11 DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT DACA IS LAWFUL \n12 200.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n13 the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n14 201.  The DACA program was a lawful exercise of the Executive Branch’s discretion to \n15 enforce the immigration laws.  Indeed, after performing a thorough analysis, the government itself \n16 concluded that DACA was lawful.87  However, the government now claims, as the basis for its \n17 rescission of the program, that DACA is unlawful.88 \n18 202.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, allows the court, “[i]n a case of \n19 actual controversy within its jurisdiction,” to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any \n20 interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.”  \n21 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n22 203.  As DACA beneficiaries, Plaintiffs have an interest in the legality of the DACA \n23 program.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA on the purported basis that the DACA \n24 program was unlawful has harmed Plaintiffs and continues to cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n25                                                  \n 87  See Dep’t of Homeland Sec.’s Auth. to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present \n26 in the U.S. & to Defer Removal of Others, 2014 WL 10788677 (Op. O.L.C. Nov. 19, 2014). \n27  88  See Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C. Duke, Rescission of the June 15, 2012 \nMemorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who \nCame to the United States as Children” (Sept. 5, 2017), \n28\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca. \nGibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher LLP \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  42   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 45 of 46\n \n1 204.  There is an actual controversy regarding whether the DACA program is lawful. \n2 205.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) that \n3 the DACA program was lawful and is lawful today. \n4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n5 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court grant the following relief: \n6 (1)  Issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) that the DACA program is \n7 lawful and constitutional;  \n8 (2)  Issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) and 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) that \n9 the termination of the DACA program was unlawful and unconstitutional; \n10 (3)  Issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) that Defendants are \n11 equitably estopped from terminating the DACA program or from using information \n12 provided pursuant to DACA for immigration enforcement purposes, except as previously \n13 authorized under the program; \n14 (4)  Issue an injunction invalidating the Rescission Memorandum, preserving the status quo, \n15 and enjoining Defendants from terminating the DACA program;  \n16 (5)  Issue an injunction enjoining Defendants from sharing or otherwise using information \n17 provided pursuant to the DACA program for immigration enforcement purposes except as \n18 previously authorized under the DACA program; and \n19 (6)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem just and proper. \n20  \nDATED:  September 18, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n21 San Francisco, California    \n/s/ Theodore J.

See generally Unconstitutionality of Obama’s Executive Actions on \nImmigration: Hearing Before the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 114th Cong. 84–85 (2015) (written testimony of Professor \n \nStephen H. Legomsky). But even the lowest reported contemporary estimate was that 100,000 people would actually benefit \nfrom the program, indicating a major policy initiative. See INS Reverses Family Fairness Policy, supra. \n \n4  Napolitano is a party to this appeal in her current capacity as President of the University of California. \n \n \n5  This criterion became known as the “age cap.” \n \n \n6  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(I)–(II) establish a three-year and ten-year bar on admission after specified periods of “unlawful \npresence.” Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C) provides a permanent bar on admission for immigrants who have accrued an \n \naggregate of more than one year of “unlawful presence” and who later attempt to cross the border clandestinely. As the district \ncourt noted below, DHS “excludes recipients of deferred action from being ‘unlawfully present’ because their deferred action is \nconsidered a period of stay authorized by the government.” Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. DHS, 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1039 (N.D. Cal. \n2018). As DHS noted in its DACA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), “[f]or purposes of future inadmissibility based upon \nunlawful presence, an individual whose case has been deferred is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in \nwhich deferred action is in effect.” Importantly, however, “deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an individual, nor \ndoes it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.” \nThe FAQs are attached as an exhibit to the Regents complaint, and are cited pervasively throughout the Garcia complaint. See \nUnited States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that for purposes of a motion to dismiss, “[c]ertain written \ninstruments attached to pleadings may be considered part of the pleading. Even if a document is not attached to a complaint, it \nmay be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the \nbasis of the plaintiff’s claim.” (internal citation omitted) ). \n \n7  Two states were dismissed from the case with leave to amend. That decision is not challenged on appeal. \n \n \n8  This bar does not affect a plaintiff’s ability to bring freestanding constitutional claims. See Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 601–05, \n108 S.Ct. 2047, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988); Padula v. Webster, 822 F.2d 97, 101 (D.C.

Nor do we have a situation where it could justifiably be found that the agency has “consciously and expressly \nadopted a general policy” that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities. See, e.g., Adams \nv. Richardson, 156 U.S. App. D.C. 267, 480 F.2d 1159 (1973) (en banc). Although we express no opinion on whether such \ndecisions would be unreviewable under § 701(a)(2), we note that in those situations the statute conferring authority on the \nagency might indicate that such decisions were not “committed to agency discretion.” \nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 n.4, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (emphasis added). \n \n10  We reject the government’s reading of Montana Air, under which the Chaney presumption would be overcome only if the agency \naction is based on a belief in a lack of jurisdiction, and the refusal to enforce is so extreme as to become an abdication of the \n \nagency’s statutory responsibilities. Both Chaney and Montana Air make clear that these are two independent exceptions to the \nnarrow rule of nonreviewability, not two elements of a single test. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4, 105 S.Ct. 1649; Montana Air, 898 \nF.2d at 756. \n \n11  The opinion is replete with equally emphatic—and equally quotable—formulations of the same point. See, e.g., City of Arlington, \n569 U.S. at 301, 133 S.Ct. 1863 (“In sum, judges should not waste their time in the mental acrobatics needed to decide whether \n \nan agency’s interpretation of a statutory provision is ‘jurisdictional’ or ‘nonjurisdictional.’ Once those labels are sheared away, it \nbecomes clear that the question in every case is, simply, whether the statutory text forecloses the agency’s assertion of \nauthority, or not.”). \n \n12  The Court gave as an example a prosecutor’s refusal to institute criminal proceedings based on her “belief ... that the law will not \nsustain a conviction.” BLE, 482 U.S. at 283, 107 S.Ct. 2360. Such a belief is not equivalent to a conclusion that the government \n \nlacked the power to institute a prosecution in the first place. For one colorful example, in Bond v. United States, prosecutors \nmade the “surprising” decision to charge “an amateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband’s lover” under the federal \nstatute implementing the international Convention on Chemical Weapons. 572 U.S. 844, 134 S. Ct. 2077, 2083–84, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 \n(2014). While the Court ultimately interpreted the statute not to encompass the charged conduct, id. at 2093–94, no one \nsuggested that the government’s aggressive decision to institute the prosecution was itself ultra vires. \n \n13  Because we take this doctrinal course, we need not decide whether the rescission of DACA would be reviewable absent the \nexception reflected in Montana Air and Chaney’s footnote four. But we do note several points. First, a literal reading of Chaney’s \n \nlanguage would not even encompass the decision to rescind DACA, since Chaney by its own terms applies only to “agency \ndecisions not to undertake enforcement action.” 470 U.S. at 832, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (emphasis added). Nowhere does the opinion \nsuggest the broader proposition that any decision simply related to enforcement should be presumed unreviewable. Our court’s \ndicta in Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 827 n.4 (9th Cir. 2016), which addressed a completely separate issue of \njurisdiction under the INA, is not to the contrary. Thus, to the extent that the Montana Air exception might not seem a perfect fit \nfor the rescission of DACA—which was not exactly a decision not to enforce—the Chaney presumption itself shares the same \ndefect. There is no daylight between the Chaney rule and the Montana Air exception in terms of the type of agency action to \nwhich they apply. So if the rescission of DACA were outside the Montana Air exception by virtue of not being strictly a \nnonenforcement decision, it would also fall outside the Chaney presumption of unreviewability in the first place. \nSecond, the D.C. Circuit has developed a line of cases explaining that while Chaney bars judicial review of a “single-shot \nnonenforcement decision,” on the other hand, “an agency’s adoption of a general enforcement policy is subject to review.” OSG \nBulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 808, 812 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, \n674–75 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ); see also Kenney v. Glickman, 96 F.3d 1118, 1123 (8th Cir. 1996); Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Horner, \n854 F.2d 490, 496–97 (D.C. Cir. 1988). \nThus, every one of the four courts that has considered the question has held that the rescission of DACA is reviewable under the \nAPA, although each has employed slightly different reasoning for that conclusion. See NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n226–34 (D.D.C. 2018); Casa de Md. v. DHS, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758, 769–70 (D. Md. 2018); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. DHS, 279 F. \nSupp. 3d 1011, 1029–31 (N.D.

Supp. 3d 127, 147–52 (E.D.N.Y. 2017). \n \n14  After hundreds of pages of briefing and over an hour of oral argument, it remains less than clear how “litigation risk” differs from \na substantive belief that DACA is illegal. We take the term to refer to a concern that DACA would be abruptly enjoined, regardless \n \nof whether the program was illegal or not. Of course, such a concern is not independent of an on-the-merits assessment of \nDACA’s legality. \n \n31 \n \n\nRegents of the University of California v. U.S. Department of..., 908 F.3d 476 (2018)   \n2018 WL 5833232 \n \n15  This conclusion is only bolstered by the fact that the government’s production of the “administrative record” in this case includes \nthe entirety of the three published judicial opinions in the Texas litigation. \n \n \n16  The Acting Secretary did reference Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s threat to amend the Texas suit to include DACA, but she \ndid so in the “Background” section of her memorandum. If anything, the inclusion of the threat in the background portion \n \nrenders its omission from the list of factors the Acting Secretary was actually “[t]aking into consideration” all the more stark. \n \n17  Secretary Kelly’s references to the factors he considered, which included obviously discretionary considerations such as “our new \nimmigration enforcement priorities,” provided a further model for how to describe a discretionary decision, which Acting \n \nSecretary Duke also chose not to follow. \n \n18  Section 1252(g) is one such provision. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 475, 119 S.Ct. 936 (describing § 1252(g)’s passage as part of IIRIRA). \n \n \n19  In its response and reply brief, the government appears to argue that another provision of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), also \nstripped the district court of jurisdiction. Although ordinarily an argument not raised in the opening brief would be waived, this \n \nargument is jurisdictional so we must consider it. See, e.g., Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt v. Lasheen, 603 F.3d 1166, \n1171 n.3 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[C]hallenges to subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived[.]”). But Section 1252(b)(9) does not bar \njurisdiction here, because it “appl[ies] only to those claims seeking judicial review of orders of removal.” Singh v. Gonzales, 499 \nF.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 313, 121 S.Ct. 2271). \n \n20  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \n \npublic interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). \n \n21  The government does not argue that its conclusion is entitled to Chevron deference, likely because “[d]eference to an agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute is not appropriate when the agency wrongly ‘believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress.’ ” \n \nGila River Indian Cmty. v. United States, 729 F.3d 1139, 1149 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting PDK Labs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F.3d 786, 798 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) ). \n \n22  U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, Number of Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, by \nFiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year 2012–2017 (March 31, 2017). The number of initial \n \napplications is the relevant metric because renewal applications are by definition limited to the pool of those already approved \nfor DACA at least once. Therefore, one would expect an even lower denial rate for renewals. \n \n23  Judge King’s dissent also makes the critical observation that, according to the declarations filed in that case, the reason DHS \ncould not point to specific instances in which DACA applicants met the program criteria but were denied as a matter of discretion \n \nwas that DHS did not have the ability to track and sort the reasons for DACA denials. Texas, 809 F.3d at 211 (King, J., dissenting). \n \n24  The government has submitted a letter pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), informing us that the current \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, issued a new memorandum regarding the DACA rescission on June 22, 2018. In \n \nthe memorandum, Secretary Nielsen “provide[d] additional explanation of the basis for the DACA rescission,” in response to an \norder filed in a parallel lawsuit. The government’s letter does not argue that the Nielsen memorandum represents fresh agency \naction that could possibly moot this appeal. We therefore leave it to the district court in the first instance to determine the \nadmissibility of Secretary Nielsen’s letter given that it cannot possibly be a part of the administrative record in this case, and its \nimpact, if any, on this case. And to the extent the Nielsen memorandum is offered as an additional justification of the original \nDACA rescission, we do not consider it in our review of Acting Secretary Duke’s decision because it is well-settled that “we will \nnot allow the agency to supply post-hoc rationalizations for its actions....” San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell, 747 \nF.3d 581, 603 (9th Cir. 2014). \n \n25  Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s dismissal of their equitable estoppel claim. \n \n \n26  The Regents argue that “the agency’s discretion to grant deferred action on the basis of the DACA criteria has been eliminated.” \nThis is not quite right either. DHS’s authority to grant deferred action under the DACA program has been eliminated, but the \n \nDACA criteria themselves are some of those that have traditionally guided immigration enforcement discretion. See Wadhia, \nsupra, at 57 (“DHS used traditional humanitarian factors to outline the parameters for the DACA program, such as tender age and \nlongtime residence in the United States.”). \n32 \n \n\nRegents of the University of California v. U.S. Department of..., 908 F.3d 476 (2018)   \n2018 WL 5833232 \n \n \n27  DHS’s DACA FAQs state that “[y]ou may be considered for renewal of DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial \nDACA (see above) AND you: [1] Did not depart the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole; [2] Have \n \ncontinuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the \npresent time; and [3] Have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do \nnot otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.” \n \n28  Astonishingly, this sentence—which appears to represent a change from the prior policy of affirmatively protecting information \nfrom disclosure—is immediately adjacent to DHS’s assurance that nothing has changed. Cf. George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four \n \n(1949), at 175 (“Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.”). \n \n29  The government argues that the statements by the President cited in the complaints do not provide sufficient evidence to \nplausibly allege discriminatory intent. The government first submits that nationality, as opposed to ethnicity, is not an invidious \n \nclassification, and that many of the cited comments go only to Mexican nationality. “Often, however, the two are identical as a \nfactual matter: one was born in the nation whose primary stock is one’s own ethnic group.” St. Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 \nU.S. 604, 614, 107 S.Ct. 2022, 95 L.Ed.2d 582 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring). And plaintiffs allege discriminatory intent not only \ntoward “Mexican nationals,” but also toward “individuals of Mexican heritage, and Latinos.” \n \n30  The district court took judicial notice of one such statement by the President: “[o]n December 29, 2017, President Trump \ntweeted: ‘The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL \n \nat the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must \nprotect our Country at all cost!’ ” There were many similar statements made by the President after he took the oath of office \nleading up to the DACA rescission on September 5, 2017. \n \n31  We do not disagree with the reasoning of Judge Owens’s concurring opinion that the likelihood of success on plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claim is a second, alternative ground for affirming the entry of the injunction. \n \n \n1  The government appears to share this view. In its petition for certiorari before judgment, the government asserted that “a \nprimary purpose of the Acting Secretary’s orderly wind-down of the DACA policy was to avoid the disruptive effects on all parties \n \nof abrupt shifts in the enforcement of the Nation’s immigration laws. Inviting more changes before final resolution of this \nlitigation would not further that interest.” \n \n2  As for the government’s appeal from the motions to dismiss, I dissent, for reasons stated here, from the majority’s holding to \naffirm the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ APA arbitrary-and-capricious claim (Part VI-A). However, I \n \nconcur in the majority’s holding to affirm the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ APA notice-and-comment claim (Part VI-B). I \nalso concur in the judgment to affirm the district court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ Due Process claims (Part VI-C; Part VI-D). And, as \nexplained here as well, I agree with the majority’s decision to affirm the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss the Equal \nProtection claim (Part VI-E) and hold that the Equal Protection claim offers an alternative ground to affirm the preliminary \ninjunction. \n \n3  This is not surprising: § 202(5) makes the Secretary “responsible for ... [e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies \nand priorities.” If we accept that this broad, discretion-granting statute authorized DACA’s implementation, it surely also \n \nsanctions DACA’s termination. \n \n4  Like the majority, I do not interpret Trump v. Hawaii, ––– U.S. ––––, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018), to preclude review \nof the President’s statements when applying the Arlington Heights standard. At the merits stage, the district court can still decide \n \nwhether, or to what degree, the President’s statements betray a discriminatory animus behind DACA’s rescission. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n33 \n ",

Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (“Regents III”), 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020).  The Supreme Court held \n5  that Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke’s September 5, 2017 memorandum \n6  terminating DACA (the “Duke Memorandum”) was subject to judicial review under the Administrative \n7  Procedure Act (“APA”) and was arbitrary and capricious in violation of that statute because it failed to \n8  consider important aspects of the decision to end DACA.  As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision, \n9  the Duke Memorandum was vacated and the DACA program was reinstated as a matter of law, \n10  protecting the benefits of DACA for nearly 700,000 current DACA recipients that have relied on the \n11  program for years to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.  Reinstating DACA \n12  also restored critical aspects of the program that had been unavailable during the prior nearly three \n13  years of litigation, including the right of approximately 300,000 eligible individuals to apply for DACA \n14  for the first time, and the ability of current and aspiring DACA recipients to request advance parole to \n15  travel abroad and return to the United States without penalty.   \n16  In practice, however, full reinstatement of the program never happened.  During the course of \n17  the litigation, President Trump had purported to install a series of officials as Acting Secretary of \n18  Homeland Security to fill the still-ongoing vacancy left by Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s departure in \n19  April 2019.  On July 28, 2020, on the heels of the Supreme Court victory, as Dreamers were filling out \n20  first-time applications and requests for advance parole that they had waited years for the opportunity \n21  to file, the latest of these officials, Defendant Chad F. Wolf, issued a memorandum (the “Wolf \n22  Memorandum”) purporting to drastically cut back the program.1  The Wolf Memorandum declared a \n23  moratorium on first-time DACA applications and requests for advance parole, and halved the period \n24  of relief available to existing DACA recipients applying for renewal, requiring recipients to file a new \n25  renewal application—and pay a new application fee—every year rather than every two years.  \n26 \n                                                 \n  1  Memorandum  from  Acting  Secretary  Chad  Wolf,  Reconsideration  of  the  June  15,  2012 \n27 \nMemorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who \nCame to the United States as Children” (July 28, 2020), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/\n28 \npublications/20_0728_s1_daca-reconsideration-memo.pdf. \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  1   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 4 of 29\n \n1  The government maintains that Defendant Wolf was authorized to modify DACA because he \n2  assumed the office of the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security \n3  Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)—a DHS-specific succession statute—upon his appointment and \n4  Senate confirmation as Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans.2  While \n5  most federal vacancy appointments are governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 \n6  (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., which grants the President authority to fill vacancies in most federal \n7  offices on a time-limited basis, Congress enacted a separate succession statute for the Department of \n8  Homeland Security (“DHS”) that specifies an initial succession order for the Secretary and empowers \n9  the Secretary to name additional officers in further order of succession, see 6 U.S.C. § 113(g).  It is \n10  undisputed that the succession orders operative throughout the vast majority of Secretary Nielsen’s \n11  tenure in office do not authorize the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to serve as Acting \n12  Secretary in the present circumstances.3  The government’s view, however, is that in the closing days \n13  of her tenure, former Secretary Nielsen modified the succession order, allowing then-Commissioner of \n14  Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan to assume the office of Acting Secretary upon \n15  Secretary Nielsen’s departure.  McAleenan then purported to further modify the succession order to \n16  the present version, under which Defendant Wolf, as Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, \n17  is now next in line following McAleenan’s departure.4 \n18  The government’s story deliberately distorts and then misrepresents the actual facts on the \n19  ground.  As at least one court and the Government Accountability Office have recognized, former \n20  Secretary Nielsen did not modify the operative succession order.  She modified a separate succession \n21  order applicable when the Secretary is unavailable due to disaster or catastrophic emergency, but not \n22  the relevant succession order applicable in case of resignation.5  As a result, McAleenan never lawfully \n23                                                   \n  2  See GAO, Matter of Department of Homeland Security – Legality of Service of Acting Secretary of \n24  Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary of \nHomeland  Security,  B-331650,  at  8  (Aug.  14,  2020)  (“GAO  Report”),  available  at \n25  https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf.    \n  3  DHS, Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. \n26 \n00106, Revision No. 08.5 (Dec. 15, 2016) (“Delegation Order 00106”).   \n27    4  GAO Report, at 8. \n  5  See Casa de Md., Inc. v. Wolf (“Casa III”), -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2020 WL 5500165, at *21-22 (D. Md. \n28 \nSept. 11, 2020); GAO Report, at 9. \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  2   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 5 of 29\n \n1  succeeded former Secretary Nielsen as Acting Secretary and had no authority to further modify the \n2  succession order to the current form on which Defendant Wolf’s purported appointment relies.  As \n3  Chief Justice Roberts recognized in Regents III,  in circumstances like these, strict adherence to settled \n4  rules matters—that where lives and livelihoods are the stakes the government must “‘turn square \n5  corners.’”  Regents III, 140 S. Ct. at 1909.  Even as to the straightforward requirements for appointment \n6  of the head of DHS prior to issuance of any directives, the Administration did anything but. \n7  More fundamentally, even if former Secretary Nielsen and McAleenan had effectively modified \n8  the succession order, Defendant Wolf would still lack authority to serve as Acting Secretary for an \n9  additional, independent reason:  He was not appointed to that office in a manner permitted by the \n10  Appointments Clause.  Article II of the Constitution carefully guards the awesome powers of the federal \n11  government by limiting the authority to appoint federal officers to those “accountable to political force \n12  and the will of the people.”  Freytag v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 884 (1991).  The \n13  Appointments Clause thus authorizes only two constitutionally permissible methods for appointing \n14  federal officers:  (1) by the President with advice and consent of the Senate; and (2) by the President, \n15  the courts, and heads of executive departments, as authorized by statute.  See U.S. Const. art. II, § 2.  \n16  “Principal” officers must be appointed by the first method, while “inferior” officers can be appointed \n17  by either method.  See Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 660 (1997).  The Appointments Clause \n18  thus ensures democratic accountability by preserving a joint role for elected legislative and executive \n19  officials in all appointments:  The President can only appoint officers with the advice and consent of \n20  the Senate or authorization by Congress, and the only other officers that Congress can vest with the \n21  appointment power—“judges” and “heads of departments”—are “principal federal officers” that must \n22  be appointed by the President with the Senate’s advice and consent.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 884. \n23  “[B]ecause of the temporary nature of the office,” “acting heads of department” are sometimes \n24  considered “inferior officer[s]” who may be appointed by either method.  United States v. Smith, 962 \n25  F.3d 755, 765 (4th Cir. 2020).  But even an acting department head must be appointed to that office by \n26  someone vested with the appointment power.  Thus, even if Defendant Wolf can be said to be acting \n27  as an inferior officer in exercising the Secretary’s powers on a temporary basis, he still must have been \n28  appointed Acting Secretary by the President, the courts, or the head of an executive department.     \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  3   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 6 of 29\n \n1  Defendant Wolf was never appointed as Acting Secretary by any of these methods.  Indeed, he \n2  was never appointed to that role by anyone.  President Trump picked him for the role by Twitter post,6 \n3  and Defendant Wolf purported to assume the role by virtue of the succession order promulgated by his \n4  immediate  predecessor,  Acting  Secretary  McAleenan.    Even  if  that  succession  order  could  be \n5  considered an appointment of Defendant Wolf by Acting Secretary McAleenan, McAleenan was not—\n6  and was never Senate confirmed as—the actual head (Secretary) of the DHS.  He merely served as \n7  Acting Secretary pursuant to a temporary appointment as an inferior officer by Secretary Nielsen.  \n8  Indeed, it is only by characterizing Acting Secretary McAleenan as an inferior officer—rather than a \n9  department head who must be Senate confirmed to that role—that McAleenan’s own appointment to \n10  that role by Secretary Nielsen can be reconciled with the Appointments Clause. \n11  The two-step appointment process by which Secretary Nielsen appointed Acting Secretary \n12  McAleenan and McAleenan appointed Defendant Wolf thus undercuts McAleenan’s authority to \n13  appoint Defendant Wolf.  Either McAleenan, as Acting Secretary, was an inferior officer—not truly \n14  “head” of the department—and therefore lacked the appointment power entirely, or he was head of the \n15  department, rather than an inferior officer, and could not have been appointed by Nielsen.  The \n16  government has never explained in any of the litigation to date how the Appointments Clause allowed \n17  McAleenan to appoint Defendant Wolf.  And because Defendant Wolf is invalidly serving as Acting \n18  Secretary, his designation of Defendant Edlow, the purported Deputy Director for Policy of Defendant \n19  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), is also unlawful. \n20  At a minimum, the HSA must be read narrowly to avoid these constitutional difficulties.  The \n21  HSA was never intended—and before the Trump Administration, was never used—to authorize a series \n22  of successive Acting Secretaries to name their successors.  The HSA vests the authority to promulgate \n23  succession orders only in the “Secretary,” not the “Acting Secretary,” and the statute expressly \n24  distinguishes between those two positions.  6 U.S.C. § 113(g).  In light of the attendant constitutional \n25  difficulties, Congress cannot be understood to have authorized someone it never confirmed as head of \n26  department to hand the reins to one of the most powerful federal agencies—with coercive authority \n                                                 \n27 \n  6  Donald  J.

Pursuant to Local Rules 3-2(c) and (d), intradistrict assignment remains proper in San \n4  Francisco because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the claim occurred \n5  in the County of San Francisco. \n6  PARTIES \n7  4.  Plaintiff Dulce Garcia (“Ms. Garcia”) is a DACA recipient and an attorney in San \n8  Diego, California.  Ms. Garcia earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of California, San \n9  Diego and her law degree from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.  She arrived in the United \n10  States from Mexico when she was four years old.  The Wolf Memorandum harms Ms. Garcia by \n11  restricting her ability to apply for advanced parole, which she had intended to apply for after the \n12  Supreme Court decision, and shortening the renewal period from two years to one year, thereby \n13  requiring  Ms.  Garcia  to  pay  an  annual  fee  for  renewal.    The  Wolf  Memorandum,  moreover, \n14  reintroduces severe fear, stress, and anxiety into Ms. Garcia’s life while Defendant Wolf purportedly \n15  reconsiders the program for an unspecified period of time.  \n16  5.  Plaintiff  Jirayut  (“New”)  Latthivongskorn  (“Mr.  Latthivongskorn”)  is  a  DACA \n17  recipient and a medical resident at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center \n18  after graduating from the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) School of Medicine.  He \n19  also received a Master of Public Health degree from the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard \n20  University.  Mr. Latthivongskorn arrived in the United States from Thailand when he was nine years \n21  old.  The Wolf Memorandum harms Mr. Latthivongskorn by restricting his ability to apply for \n22  advanced parole, which he had intended to apply for after the Supreme Court decision, and by \n23  shortening the renewal period from two years to one year, thereby requiring Mr. Latthivongskorn to \n24  pay an annual fee for renewal.  The Wolf Memorandum reintroduces severe fear, stress, and anxiety \n25  into Mr. Latthivongskorn’s life while Defendant Wolf purportedly reconsiders the program for an \n26  unspecified period of time. \n27  6.

Ms. Ramirez arrived in the United States from \n3  Mexico when she was five years old.  The Wolf Memorandum harms Ms. Ramirez by restricting her \n4  ability to apply for advanced parole, which she had intended to apply for after the Supreme Court \n5  decision, and shortening the renewal period from two years to one year, thereby requiring Ms. Ramirez \n6  to pay an annual fee for renewal.  The Wolf Memorandum reintroduces severe fear, stress, and anxiety \n7  into Ms. Ramirez’s life while Defendant Wolf purportedly reconsiders the program for an unspecified \n8  period of time. \n9  7.  Plaintiff Miriam Gonzalez Avila (“Ms. Gonzalez”) is a DACA recipient and a teacher \n10  at Crown Preparatory Academy in Los Angeles, California.  She also received a Master of Arts in \n11  Urban Education from Loyola Marymount University.  Ms. Gonzalez arrived in the United States \n12  from Mexico when she was six years old.  The Wolf Memorandum harms Ms. Gonzalez by shortening \n13  the renewal period from two years to one year, thereby requiring Ms. Gonzalez to pay an annual fee \n14  for renewal.  It also harms her by restricting her ability to apply for advanced parole to visit her \n15  maternal grandmother whose health has been declining over the past year.  The Wolf Memorandum, \n16  moreover, reintroduces severe fear, stress, and anxiety into Ms. Gonzalez’s life while Defendant Wolf \n17  purportedly reconsiders the program for an unspecified period of time. \n18  8.  Plaintiff Saul Jimenez Suarez (“Mr. Jimenez”) is a DACA recipient and a special \n19  education teacher, coach, and mentor in Los Angeles, California.  Mr. Jimenez arrived in the United \n20  States from Mexico when he was one year old.  The Wolf Memorandum harms Mr. Jimenez by \n21  restricting his ability to apply for advanced parole, which he had intended to apply for after the \n22  Supreme Court decision, and by shortening the renewal period from two years to one year, thereby \n23  requiring Mr. Jimenez to pay an annual fee for renewal.  The Wolf Memorandum reintroduces severe \n24  fear, stress, and anxiety into Mr. Jimenez’s life while Defendant Wolf purportedly reconsiders the \n25  program for an unspecified period of time.     \n26  9.  Plaintiff Marco Antonio Salinas Munoz (“Mr. Munoz”) applied for DACA after the \n27  Supreme Court’s ruling and is currently a high school student.  Mr. Munoz arrived in the United States \n28  from Mexico when he was three years old and otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining DACA.

The Wolf Memorandum imposes severe obstacles to Mr. \n3  Munoz achieving his dream of studying at the University of California, Berkeley and becoming a \n4  mechanical engineer.  \n5  10.  Plaintiff Dulce Berenice Vargas Baltazar (“Ms. Baltazar”) is a first-year student at \n6  Chico State University.  After the Supreme Court’s ruling, she had hoped to apply for DACA for the \n7  first time.  Ms. Baltazar arrived in the United States from Mexico when she was one year old and \n8  otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining DACA.  The Wolf Memorandum deprives Ms. Baltazar of \n9  the opportunity to apply for and obtain DACA, and to apply for its many corresponding benefits.  The \n10  Wolf Memorandum also imposes severe obstacles to Ms. Baltazar’s dream of attending law school \n11  and helping individuals from disadvantaged and underrepresented communities obtain justice through \n12  the legal system.   \n13  11.  Plaintiff Ericka Lisseth Daniel Santellan (“Ms. Santellan”) is an admitted student at \n14  Mt. San Antonio College.  After the Supreme Court’s ruling, she had hoped to apply for DACA for \n15  the first time.  Ms. Santellan arrived in the United States from Mexico when she was one year old and \n16  otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining DACA.  The Wolf Memorandum deprives Ms. Santellan of \n17  the opportunity to apply for and obtain DACA, and to apply for its many corresponding benefits.  The \n18  Wolf Memorandum also imposes severe obstacles to Ms. Santellan’s dream of becoming a nurse and \n19  providing care to those in need.   \n20  12.  Plaintiff Grisel Guadalupe Chavez Diaz (“Ms. Diaz”) is a first-year student at the \n21  University of California, Berkeley.  After the Supreme Court’s ruling, she had hoped to apply for \n22  DACA for the first time.  Ms. Diaz arrived in the United States from Mexico when she was three years \n23  old and otherwise meets the criteria for obtaining DACA.  The Wolf Memorandum deprives Ms. Diaz \n24  of the opportunity to apply for and obtain DACA, and to apply for its many corresponding benefits.  \n25  The Wolf Memorandum also imposes severe obstacles to Ms. Diaz’s dream of becoming an architect \n26  and providing sustainable housing for low-income households. \n27  13.  Plaintiff Felipe Alvarez Carrillo (“Mr. Carrillo”) is a computer programmer.  After \n28  the Supreme Court’s ruling, he had hoped to apply for DACA for the first time.

The Wolf Memorandum deprives Mr. Carrillo of the opportunity to apply for and \n3  obtain DACA, and to apply for its many corresponding benefits.  The Wolf Memorandum also \n4  imposes severe obstacles to frustrate Mr. Carrillo’s dream of starting his own business designing \n5  computers and virtual reality stations.9  \n6  14.  Defendant  United  States  of  America  includes  all  government  agencies  and \n7  departments responsible for the implementation, administration, termination, and curtailment of the \n8  DACA program. \n9  15.  Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet department of the \n10  federal government with responsibility for, among other things, administering and enforcing the \n11  nation’s immigration laws.  \n12  16.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is an \n13  operational and support component agency within DHS, with responsibility for, among other things, \n14  administering the nation’s immigration system.  \n15  17.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is purportedly Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and \n16  is sued in his purported official capacity.  Secretary Wolf is responsible for managing DHS, including \n17  the administration and enforcement of policies and practices related to DACA. \n18  18.  Defendant Joseph Edlow is the purported Deputy Director for Policy of USCIS.  \n19  Purported Deputy Director Edlow issued additional guidance regarding the implementation of the \n20  Wolf Memorandum on August 21, 2020. \n21  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n22  I.  The DACA Program \n23  19.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \n24  memorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”).  Under DACA, \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n  9  After the original complaint was filed, Plaintiff Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza was granted Lawful \nPermanent Resident status, and no longer asserts a cause of action against Defendants. \n28 \n \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  9   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 12 of 29\n \n1  individuals who arrived in the United States as young children and who met certain specific criteria \n2  may request deferred action for a fixed period of time—originally, two years—subject to renewal.10 \n3  20.  Once accepted into the program, DACA recipients are granted the right not to be \n4  arrested or detained based solely on their immigration status during the time period their deferred \n5  action is in effect.11 \n6  21.  DACA  recipients  are  also  eligible  for  work  authorization  under  long-standing \n7  regulations and certain public benefits, such as Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits, \n8  and, in certain states, benefits such as driver’s licenses, health care, financial aid, tuition benefits, and \n9  unemployment insurance.12 \n10  22.  Additionally, DACA recipients do not accrue time under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). \n11  23.  The original DACA program also permitted recipients to apply for advanced parole \n12  to briefly depart the U.S. and legally return under certain circumstances.13 \n13  24.  In addition to these legal benefits, DACA serves as a gateway to numerous other \n14  important public and private practical benefits, enabling recipients to open bank accounts, obtain \n15 \n16                                                   \n 10  Memorandum from Secretary Janet Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect \n17  to  Individuals  Who  Came  to  the  United  States  as  Children,  at  1–2  (June  15,  2012), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-\n18  came-to-us-as-children.pdf (hereinafter “2012 DACA Memorandum”).

DACA has been widely perceived as a success.  The program has enabled nearly \n4  800,00 individuals to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.  Today, DACA \n5  protects nearly 700,000 current recipients.  DACA recipients and their families—including 200,000 \n6  U.S.-born children—as well as their employers and educational institutions, have made significant \n7  decisions  based  on  forbearance  from  removal.14    DACA  recipients  are  deeply  integrated  into \n8  communities across the United States, contributing more than $42 billion to the annual GDP in the \n9  United States.15   \n10  II.  Plaintiffs’ Successful Challenge To The Trump Administration’s First Attempt To \nRescind DACA \n11 \n26.  Despite DACA’s success and widespread bipartisan support, then-Acting Secretary \n12 \nof Homeland Security Duke issued a memorandum on September 5, 2017 formally rescinding the \n13 \nDACA program.16 \n14 \n27.  On September 18, 2017, Plaintiffs Dulce Garcia, Miriam Gonzalez Avila, Saul \n15 \nJimenez Suarez, Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza, Norma Ramirez, and Jirayut Latthivongskorn filed suit \n16 \nchallenging the Duke Memorandum under the APA.  See Garcia v. United States, No. 3:17-cv-5380 \n17 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 18, 2017).  The suit was consolidated with three related actions under Regents of the \n18 \nUniversity of California v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Security (“Regents I”), No. 3:17-cv-\n19 \n5211, which had been filed on September 8, 2017.17   \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22   14  See Roberto G.

United States Department of Homeland Security, No. 1:17-cv-5235 (N.D. \nCal. Sept. 11, 2017); City of San Jose v. Trump, No. 5:17-cv-5329 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2017); see \n28 \nalso ECF Nos. 41, 43 (orders relating cases).    \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  11   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 14 of 29\n \n1  28.  Following extensive motions practice, on January 9, 2018, this Court granted the first \n2  nationwide, preliminary injunction ordering the Trump Administration to “maintain” DACA “on a \n3  nationwide basis on the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on \n4  September 5, 2017.”  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1048 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  The Court reasoned \n5  that Plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of their claim that the Duke Memorandum was \n6  arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  Id. at 1037.  While this Court’s decision reinstated \n7  renewals, its ruling did not apply to first-time applications or requests for advance parole.  In Batalla \n8  Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 436 (E.D.N.Y. 2018), the Eastern District of New York quickly \n9  followed suit, granting an identical preliminary injunction.  The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed this \n10  Court’s preliminary injunction on appeal.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n11  Sec. (“Regents II”), 966 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 2020). \n12  29.  Two related lawsuits simultaneously proceeded to judgments on the merits.  In \n13  NAACP v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457 (D.D.C. 2018), the D.C. district court ultimately granted \n14  summary judgment to plaintiffs challenging the Duke Memorandum and ordered that memorandum \n15  vacated, but stayed vacatur pending appeal except as to renewal applications that were already covered \n16  by this Court’s preliminary injunction.  See NAACP v. Trump, 321 F. Supp. 3d 143, 149-50 (D.D.C. \n17  2018).  And in Casa de Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security (“Casa I”), 284 F. Supp. 3d \n18  758, 773 (D. Md. 2018), the District of Maryland initially ruled that the Duke Memorandum did not \n19  violate the APA, but the Fourth Circuit reversed that ruling and vacated the rescission as arbitrary and \n20  capricious, Case de Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security (“Casa II”), 924 F.3d 684, 707 \n21  (4th Cir. 2019).  \n22  30.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari from three of these cases—the Ninth Circuit’s \n23  decision in this case, the Eastern District of New York’s decision in Batalla Vidal, and the D.C. district \n24  court’s decision in NAACP—and consolidated them for briefing and argument.18  \n25  31.  On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its decision affirming all three lower \n26  court rulings.  The Court determined the decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review \n27 \n                                                 \n 18  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.

Dep’t of Homeland Sec. \n2  v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (“Regents III”), 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1906 (2020).  The Court analyzed \n3  only the Duke Memorandum and found that it suffered from two legal defects:  It neither contained a \n4  “discussion of forbearance or the option of retaining forbearance without benefits,” nor addressed the \n5  “‘legitimate reliance’” on DACA.  Id. at 1913-15.  The court emphasized that the “‘the Government \n6  should turn square corners in dealing with the people.’”  Id. at 1909. \n7  32.  After the Court’s decision, the Supreme Court denied the government’s petition for \n8  writ of certiorari in Casa II, and the Fourth Circuit issued its mandate.  The Ninth Circuit also issued \n9  its mandate in this case, and the courts of appeals issued mandates affirming the decisions in Batalla \n10  Vidal and NAACP.  Regents, ECF No. 303. \n11  33.  By affirming the merits decision in NAACP, the Supreme Court ensured that the Duke \n12  Memorandum would be vacated pursuant to that decision and the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Casa \n13  II.  This required DHS to fully restore DACA, including accepting first-time applications from \n14  approximately 300,000 individuals who had become eligible for DACA during the litigation, and \n15  processing requests for advance parole from current DACA recipients.19  The district court in Casa I \n16  made this explicit by ordering the government to reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the Duke \n17  Memorandum.  Order, Casa I, ECF No. 97, at 3 (D. Md. July 17, 2020).   \n18  34.  As a result, and after years of waiting with uncertainty, Plaintiffs Munoz, Baltazar, \n19  Santellan, Diaz, Carrillo and other Dreamers intended to prepare, prepared or submitted applications \n20  to obtain DACA for the first time.  Plaintiffs Garcia, Latthivongskorn, Ramirez, Gonzalez, Jimenez \n21  and other current DACA recipients intended to prepare, prepared, or submitted requests for advance \n22  parole to travel freely and return to the United States without penalty.  And finally, Plaintiffs Garcia, \n23  Latthivongskorn, Ramirez, Gonzalez, Jimenez, and other current DACA recipients intend to prepare \n24  or have prepared or submitted applications for their DACA to be renewed during the period covered \n25  by the Wolf Memorandum.   \n26 \n                                                 \n 19  See  Nicole  Prchal  Svajlenka  et  al.,  The  Trump  Administration  Must  Immediately  Resume \n27 \nProcessing  New  DACA  Applications,  Center  for  American  Progress  (July  13,  2020), \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2020/07/13/487514/trump-\n28 \nadministration-must-immediately-resume-processing-new-daca-applications/. \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  13   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 16 of 29\n \n1  III.  Defendant Wolf Purports To Assume The Office Of Acting Secretary Of DHS \nPursuant To Homeland Security Act \n2 \n35.  Compliance with the Supreme Court’s orders fell to the current leadership of DHS, \n3 \nwhich had changed repeatedly throughout the three-year course of litigation.  At the time of the \n4 \ndecision, and still today, DHS’s day-to-day operations were conducted under the leadership of \n5 \nDefendant Wolf, purporting to act under the title of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant \n6 \nto the Homeland Security Act during the vacancy left by Secretary Nielsen’s departure from office.  \n7 \nDefendant Wolf’s path to that office is at the heart of this case. \n8 \nA.  The Statutory Framework \n9 \n36.  Vacancy appointments for most federal offices are governed by the Federal Vacancies \n10 \nReform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.  The FVRA governs who may serve as the acting head of an \n11 \nagency “[i]f an officer of an Executive agency . . . whose appointment to the office is required to be \n12 \nmade by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . . . resigns.”  Id. § 3345(a).  \n13 \n37.  The FVRA sets forth three ways for an acting officer to assume an office that requires \n14 \nadvice and consent of the Senate when a vacancy arises.  First, “the first assistant to the office of such \n15 \nofficer” shall perform the duties in an acting capacity.  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1).  Second, the President \n16 \nmay direct an official who already serves in an office for which appointment is required by and with \n17 \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.  Id. § 3345(a)(2).  Third, the President may direct “an officer or \n18 \nemployee of such Executive agency,” if such officer of employee meets certain criteria not relevant \n19 \nhere.  Id. § 3345(a)(3).   \n20 \n38.  Notwithstanding certain exceptions not relevant here, a person who fills a vacancy \n21 \npursuant to one of these three routes may only serve in that “‘office’ for 210 days as measured from \n22 \nthe date of vacancy.”  See Casa III, 2020 WL 5500165, at *15 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1)).   \n23 \n39.  Section 3348 provides that unless an officer is “performing . . . functions and duties” \n24 \nin accordance with the FVRA, including the 210-day limitation set forth in Section 3346, the office \n25 \n“shall remain vacant.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).  Under this provision, any action taken by an official \n26 \nwho occupies the position contrary to the FVRA “shall have no force or effect.”  Id. § 3348(d)(1). \n27 \n40.  While the FVRA is the exclusive means for authorizing acting service, a statute may \n28 \nqualify as an exception if it expressly “authorizes” the President, a court, or the Head of a Department, \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  14   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 17 of 29\n \n1  “to designate an officer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified office \n2  temporarily in an acting capacity” or “designates an officer or employee to perform the functions and \n3  duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity.”  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1).   \n4  41.  The Homeland Security Act is one such exception.  The HSA provides an order of \n5  succession outside of the FVRA when a vacancy arises in the position of Secretary of Homeland \n6  Security.  Id.  \n7  42.  The HSA created DHS and the position of Secretary of Homeland Security to head \n8  the department and “have direction, authority, and control over it.”  HSA, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 \n9  Stat. 2135, 2142, title I, § 102.  The Secretary is to be “appointed by the President, by and with the \n10  advice and consent of the Senate.”  Id.   \n11  43.  The HSA also created the position of Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security \n12  (“Deputy Secretary”) and made the Deputy Secretary the “first assistant for purposes of” the FVRA.  \n13  6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A).   \n14  44.  If  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Secretary  is  vacant,  the  HSA  provides  that, \n15  “notwithstanding” the FVRA, the “Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting \n16  Secretary.”  Id. § 113(g)(1).   \n17  45.   In the event the top three positions are vacant, the HSA contains a provision \n18  providing that “the Secretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further order of \n19  succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).   \n20  B.  The First Nielsen Delegation \n21  46.  In  December  2016,  then-Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Jeh  Johnson  issued \n22  Delegation Order 00106.20  This document has been the “DHS’ repository for changes to the order of \n23  succession for the office of the Secretary,” and it is “updated any time the Secretary changes the \n24  succession orders.”  Casa III, 2020 WL 5500165, at *20.  \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n 20  DHS, Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. \n00106, Revision No. 08.5 (Dec. 15, 2016).   \n28 \n \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  15   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 18 of 29\n \n1  47.  In February 2019, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen exercised \n2  authority under the HSA to designate an order of succession in Delegation Order 00106 (“First Nielsen \n3  Delegation”).21   \n4  48.  The First Nielsen Delegation set forth two grounds for assuming the position of \n5  Acting Secretary.  The first ground occurred in the event of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or \n6  inability to perform the functions of the office, and the second occurred if the Secretary was \n7  unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.  GAO Report, at 5; First Nielsen \n8  Delegation, § II.A-II.B.   \n9  49.  Each ground had its own order of succession.  In the cases of the Secretary’s death, \n10  resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office, the order of succession was governed \n11  by Executive Order 13753.  First Nielsen Delegation, § II.A.  Executive Order 13753 required \n12  succession to the Acting Secretary role in the following order:   \n13  (1) Deputy Secretary;  \n14  (2) Under Secretary for Management;  \n15  (3)  Administrator  of  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (“FEMA \n16  Administrator”);  \n17  (4) Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs;22  \n18  (5) Under Secretary for Science and Technology;  \n19  (6) Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis; and \n20  (7) CBP Commissioner.   \n21  50.  In cases where the Secretary is unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n22  emergency, Annex A governed the order of the succession.  See First Nielsen Delegation § II.B.  At \n23  this time, the order of succession found in Annex A was the same as the order of succession in \n24  Executive Order 13753.  See GAO Report, at 5. \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27   21  See GAO Report, at 5. \n 22  This agency preceded the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”). \n28 \n \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  16   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 19 of 29\n \n1  C.  Secretary Nielsen’s Resignation And The Second Nielsen Delegation \n2  51.  On April 7, 2019, Secretary Nielsen announced her resignation.23  On the same day, \n3  President Trump announced via Twitter that Kevin McAleenan (then-CBP Commissioner) would \n4  assume the role of Acting DHS Secretary.24  Later that day, Secretary Nielsen announced, also via \n5  Twitter, that she would remain Secretary until April 10, 2019.25 \n6  52.  Before  she  left  the  Office,  Secretary  Nielsen  updated  the  succession  order  in \n7  Delegation No. 00106 (“Second Nielsen Delegation”).26  The Second Nielsen Delegation modified \n8  Annex A (the order of succession for vacancies in the event of disaster or catastrophic emergency).  \n9  It changed that order of succession to the following:  \n10  (1) Deputy Secretary; \n11  (2) Under Secretary for Management;  \n12  (3) CBP Commissioner; and  \n13  (4) Administrator of FEMA.  \n14  See Second Nielsen Delegation, Annex A.  The Second Nielsen Delegation thus removed the Director \n15  of the National Protection and Programs Directorate (now CISA) from the order of succession and \n16  elevated the CBP Commissioner to third in line in the event of disaster or catastrophic emergency.  \n17  The Second Nielsen Delegation preserved the applicability of Executive Order 13753 for vacancies \n18  triggered upon the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office.   \n19  53.  On  April  10,  2020,  Secretary  Nielsen  left  office,  and  Under  Secretary  for \n20  Management Claire Grady resigned.   \n21 \n22 \n23                                                   \n 23  Letter from Kirstjen M.

McAleenan’s Purported Appointment And The McAleenan Delegation \n2  54.  The  government  treated  the  Second  Nielsen  Delegation  as  if  it  amended  the \n3  succession order that is triggered in the event of a Secretary’s resignation.  Accordingly, CBP \n4  Commissioner Kevin McAleenan assumed the role of Acting Secretary.   \n5  55.  On  November  8,  2019,  the  212th  day  of  his  purported  designation  as  Acting \n6  Secretary, McAleenan purported to revise Delegation Order 00106.  See DHS, Orders of Succession \n7  and Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, Revision No. 08.6 \n8  (“McAleenan Delegation”).  \n9  56.  The McAleenan Delegation purported to make two changes.  First, it replaced the \n10  order of succession for vacancies caused by death, resignation, or inability to perform the Office’s \n11  function, which was set forth in Executive Order 13753, with the succession order outlined in Annex \n12  A to the Second Nielsen Delegation.  See McAleenan Delegation §§ II.A.  Second, McAleenan also \n13  purported to change the order of succession found in Annex A so that Under Secretary for Strategy, \n14  Policy, and Plans, a newly created position, would be next in line in the event of a vacancy caused by \n15  death, resignation, or inability to perform the Office’s functions.  See McAleenan Delegation, Annex \n16  A.  As a result of these changes, the succession order would be as follows:  \n17  (1) Deputy Secretary;  \n18  (2) Under Secretary for Management; \n19   (3) CBP Commissioner; and  \n20  (4) Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans.   \n21  Id.   \n22  E.  Mr. Wolf’s Purported Appointment \n23  57.  On November 13, 2019, the Senate confirmed Defendant Wolf to the position of \n24  Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans. \n25  58.  On  the  same  day,  McAleenan  resigned  as  both  Acting  Secretary  and  CBP \n26  Commissioner.   \n27  59.  The  government  treated  the  McAleenan  Delegation  as  a  valid  revision  to  the \n28  succession order.  Accordingly, Defendant Wolf purported to assume the office of Acting Secretary \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  18   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 21 of 29\n \n1  when McAleenan resigned, and remained in office at the time of the Supreme Court’s decision in \n2  Regents III. \n3  60.  Defendant Wolf purportedly designated Defendant Edlow Deputy Director for Policy \n4  at USCIS on February 19, 2020. \n5  61.  More than 500 days after Secretary Nielsen resigned, the President indicated his intent \n6  to nominate Defendant Wolf for DHS Secretary on August 25, 2020. \n7  IV.  The Wolf And Edlow Memoranda And The Harm Caused To Plaintiffs \n8  62.  Despite  the  court  orders  reinstating  DACA,  DHS—under  Defendant  Wolf’s \n9  purported tenure as Acting Secretary—did not adjudicate any initial DACA applications or requests \n10  for advance parole, despite receiving them.  DHS additionally failed to provide any information \n11  regarding whether and when the agency would begin to accept new applications or process advanced \n12  parole requests.  \n13  63.  DHS  broke  its  silence  in  July  2020  when  Defendant  Wolf  issued  the  Wolf \n14  Memorandum executing drastic cuts to the DACA program. \n15  64.  The Wolf Memorandum confirmed that DHS had received first-time applications for \n16  DACA and requests for advance parole, but had not processed them and instead “generally held” those \n17  requests.27   \n18  65.  While the Wolf Memorandum indicated that Defendant Wolf would undertake a “full \n19  reconsideration of the DACA policy,” it provided for “certain immediate changes” that revoke or \n20  curtail core components of DACA.28  It requires DHS to (1) reject categorically all initial DACA \n21  applications and associated applications for work authorization, (2) reject all pending and future \n22  applications for advance parole “absent exceptional circumstances,” and (3) limit the renewal period \n23  to one year rather than two years thereby requiring current DACA recipients to pay a fee annually.29   \n24  66.  As a basis for these “immediate changes,” the Wolf Memorandum  offered the \n25  following “concerns”: (1) Congress’s inability to enact a legislative solution; (2) Defendant Wolf’s \n                                                 \n26 \n 27  Wolf Memorandum, at 7. \n27   28  Id. at 1. \n 29  Id. at 1, 7–8. \n28 \n \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  19   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 22 of 29\n \n1  “reservations as a matter of policy about . . . maintaining a formal process, for non-enforcement”; and \n2  (3) “sending mixed messages” that “may contribute to the general problem of illegal immigration,” \n3  which is “more pressing in the context of children.”30  Defendant Wolf claimed that the changes \n4  implemented to DACA would “mitigate” these concerns “without encroaching materially on the \n5  reliance interests that have been raised by individuals, organizations, and state and local governments \n6  during the course of the extensive litigation.”31  \n7  67.  On  August  21,  2020,  Defendant  Edlow  issued  a  memorandum,  (the  “Edlow \n8  Memorandum”), instructing USCIS officials to take actions directed by the Wolf Memorandum.32  \n9  The Edlow Memorandum provides that any DACA renewal application filed “more than 150 days” \n10  before the expiration of the recipient’s status would be rejected to promote “efficient use of agency \n11  resources.”33  The Edlow Memorandum additionally states that USCIS will reject all advance parole \n12  applications filed before the Wolf Memorandum and provides that in most instances USCIS will reject \n13  advance parole requests to travel abroad for educational or employment-related purposes or to visit \n14  family members.34   \n15  68.  Together, the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda effectively nullify the Supreme Court’s \n16  decision requiring DHS to restore the DACA policy in full pending the appropriate agency action.  \n17  They cause severe harm to Plaintiffs as well as hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.     \n18  69.  At the threshold, the memoranda deprive Plaintiffs Munoz, Baltazar, Santellan, Diaz, \n19  Carrillo, and other Dreamers of the opportunity to apply for and obtain DACA for the first time.  The \n20  memoranda, therefore, deprive Plaintiffs and other Dreamers of the opportunity to be safe from \n21  deportation and to apply for corresponding benefits, such as work authorization and Social Security.   \n22  70.  The memoranda, for example, severely harm Plaintiff Munoz and other Dreamers \n23  who have already applied for DACA after the Supreme Court’s ruling.  They have been denied the \n                                                 \n24 \n 30  Id. at 5. \n25   31  Id.  \n 32  Memorandum from Joseph Edlow, Implementing Acting Secretary Chad Wolf’s July 28, 2020 \n26 \nMemorandum,  (Aug.  21,  2020),  https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-\nalerts/dacamemo.pdf.  \n27 \n 33  Id. at 5. \n28 \n 34  Id. at 2, 6. \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  20   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 23 of 29\n \n1  opportunity to be safe from deportation, and are vulnerable now that they have turned over sensitive \n2  personal information to the federal government in their applications.   \n3  71.  The  memoranda  additionally  harm  Plaintiffs  Garcia,  Gonzalez,  Ramirez, \n4  Latthivongskorn, Jimenez, and other current DACA recipients who must seek renewal every year, \n5  rather than every two years.  The shortened renewal period imposes a financial burden and creates \n6  stress and anxiety.   \n7  72.  The  memoranda  additionally  harm  Plaintiffs  by  depriving  them  of  important \n8  opportunities to further their education and/or earn a living.  For example, Plaintiff Baltazar will be \n9  unlikely to attend and graduate from law school; Plaintiff Santellan will be unlikely to attend and \n10  graduate from nursing school; Plaintiff Diaz will be unlikely to fulfill her dream of becoming an \n11  architect and provide sustainable housing for low-income households; Plaintiff Munoz will be \n12  unlikely to complete his study at University of California, Berkeley and become a mechanical \n13  engineer; and Plaintiff Carrillo will be less likely to start his own business.  The memoranda therefore \n14  hang Plaintiffs’ promising futures in the balance, subjecting Plaintiffs to unnecessary fear, anxiety \n15  and stress.  Indeed, the Wolf Memorandum may cause Plaintiffs Munoz, Baltazar and other talented \n16  Dreamers to drop out of school because they will not be able to afford tuition given the loss of \n17  available financial assistance and the likelihood that they will not be able to work legally upon \n18  graduation.  Those already enrolled, such as Plaintiffs Baltazar and Santellan, will be less likely to \n19  complete their education due to the loss of current and future earning potential.    \n20  73.  The memoranda will also severely harm Plaintiffs and their families.  Because many \n21  DACA applicants and recipients also have family overseas, the memoranda’s limitations on advance \n22  parole will cause DACA applicants to become further estranged from their countries of origin—\n23  making the prospect of deportation even more harmful to DACA applicants and recipients and their \n24  families.  \n25  74.  Finally, DACA recipients’ contributions to their families, communities, and their \n26  local and national economies cannot be disputed.  Dreamers have contributed an estimated $42 billion \n27 \n28 \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  21   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 24 of 29\n \n1  to the economy every year.35  The memoranda reduce the number of individuals who can apply for \n2  DACA to zero, and thus will necessarily harm the economy and American competitiveness. \n3  CAUSES OF ACTION \n4  FIRST COUNT \n5  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – VIOLATION OF SUCCESSION ORDER AND \n6  HOMELAND SECURITY ACT, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) \n7  75.

The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside” final agency \n13  action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; \n14  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”;  and  “in  excess  of  statutory \n15  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C).   \n16  79.  Under the HSA, the Secretary of Homeland Security may “designate such other \n17  officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.” 6 U.S.C. \n18  § 113(g)(2). \n19  80.  The Second Nielsen Delegation amended only Annex A and left intact Executive \n20  Order 13573 that articulated the succession order that governed in the event of a resignation.  Under \n21  that succession order, McAleenan was not next in line to assume the position of Acting Secretary.  \n22  Thus, McAleenan invalidly succeeded Secretary Nielsen as Acting Secretary. \n23  81.  McAleenan was not a valid Acting Secretary under the HSA, and thus he did not have \n24  the authority to amend DHS’s succession order.  Accordingly, the McAleenan Delegation is invalid. \n25  82.  The McAleenan Delegation is also invalid because the HSA, by its plain text, vests \n26  the power to establish a succession order for the office of Secretary of Homeland Security only on the \n27 \n                                                 \n 35  Jacqueline Varas, The Fiscal Implications of the DACA Program, American Action Forum (Jan. \n28 \n18, 2018), available at https://bit.ly/3j4M0Si. \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  22   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 25 of 29\n \n1  Senate-confirmed “Secretary,” not on other officers serving as “Acting Secretary.”  Even if McAleenan \n2  were validly appointed as Acting Secretary, therefore, he would lack statutory authority to amend \n3  Secretary Nielsen’s operative succession order.  \n4  83.  Defendant  Wolf  assumed  the  role  of  Acting  Secretary  pursuant  to  the  invalid \n5  McAleenan Delegation.  Thus, Defendant Wolf is not a valid Acting Secretary under the HSA.  \n6  84.  Because Defendant Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary, Defendant \n7  Wolf lacked any legal authority to designate Defendant Edlow to the position of USCIS Deputy \n8  Director for Policy. \n9  85.  Defendant  Wolf’s  invalid  service  as  Acting  Secretary  means  that  the  Wolf \n10  Memorandum and the subsequent Edlow Memorandum were issued without authority.  Accordingly, \n11  the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum should be set aside under the APA.   \n12  SECOND COUNT \n13  ARTICLE II – APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE VIOLATION \n14  86.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n15  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n16  87.  Article II of the U.S. Constitution authorizes only two constitutionally permissible \n17  methods for appointing federal officers:  (1) by the President with advice and consent of the Senate; \n18  and (2) by the President, the courts, and heads of executive departments, if authorized to do so by \n19  Congress.  See U.S. Const. art. II, § 2.  “Principal” officers must be appointed by the first method, \n20  while “inferior” officers can be appointed by either method.  See Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660.  In this \n21  way, the Appointments Clause “serves both to curb Executive abuses of the appointment power . . . \n22  and to promote a judicious choice of persons for filling the offices of the union.”  Id. at 659 (quotations \n23  marks and alterations omitted).  It is a “critical ‘structural safeguard [] of the constitutional scheme.’”  \n24  NLRB v. Sw. Gen., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, 935 (2017) (quoting Edmund, 520 U.S. at 659).   \n25  88.  The Department of Homeland Security is an Executive Department, 5 U.S.C. § 101, \n26  and the Secretary of Homeland Security, as a Head of Department, is subject to the Appointments \n27  Clause.  See Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Inv., LLC, 590 U.S. ___, 140 S. \n28  Ct. 1649, 1657 (2020).   \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  23   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 26 of 29\n \n1  89.  Under the HSA, the Secretary of Homeland Security may “designate such other \n2  officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. \n3  § 113(g)(2). \n4  90.  Defendant Wolf purported to assume the role of Acting Secretary pursuant to 6 U.S.C. \n5  § 113(g)(2).  But Defendant Wolf was not appointed by a constitutionally permissible method under \n6  the Appointments Clause. \n7  91.  Even if McAleenan’s modification of the succession order could be considered an \n8  appointment of Defendant Wolf, McAleenan was not the head (Secretary) of the Department of \n9  Homeland Security, and thus lacked the power to make appointments under the Appointments Clause.   \n10  92.  At most, in his temporary capacity as Acting Secretary, McAleenan served as an \n11  inferior officer, but an inferior office has no appointment authority under the Appointments Clause. \n12  93.  In the alternative, to the extent McAleenan, in his capacity as Acting Secretary, could \n13  be considered the actual Head of Department for purposes of the Appointments Clause, he served as \n14  a “principal federal office[r],” and therefore could be appointed to that office only by the President \n15  with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 884.  Because McAleenan was never \n16  Senate confirmed as Acting Secretary, he was never validly vested with the power of a Head of \n17  Department to make appointments under the Appointments Clause. \n18  94.  Accordingly,  Defendant  Wolf’s  purported  appointed  violates  the  Appointments \n19  Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n20  95.  Because Defendant Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary, Defendant \n21  Wolf lacked any legal authority to designate Defendant Edlow to the position of USCIS Deputy \n22  Director for Policy. \n23  96.  Defendant  Wolf’s  invalid  service  as  Acting  Secretary  means  that  the  Wolf \n24  Memorandum and the subsequent Edlow Memorandum were issued without authority.  Accordingly, \n25  the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum must be set aside. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  24   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 27 of 29\n \n1  THIRD COUNT \n2  APA – ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n3  97.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n4  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n5  98.  DHS is an agency subject to the requirements of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1). \n6  99.  The Wolf and Edlow Memoranda constitute final agency actions that are reviewable \n7  by this Court under the APA. \n8  100.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside” final agency \n9  action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; \n10  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”;  and  “in  excess  of  statutory \n11  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C).   \n12  101.  Pursuant  to  the  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard,  an  agency  must  engage  in \n13  “‘reasoned decisionmaking.’”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015).  A court reviewing such \n14  a decision must assess whether the decision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors and \n15  whether there has been a clear error of judgment.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, \n16  401 U. S. 402, 416 (1971); San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, 601 (9th \n17  Cir. 2014).  \n18  102.  In issuing and implementing the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda, Defendants have acted \n19  arbitrarily and capriciously under this standard.  Defendants offer no reasoned analysis for modifying \n20  DACA other than Defendant Wolf’s “desire” to “mitigate” purported concerns about DACA while he \n21  “considers anew the DACA policy.”  The supposed rationales, however, fail to consider important \n22  aspects of the problem.  For example, there is no explanation in the Wolf Memorandum as to how the \n23  measures adopted to curtail DACA mitigate his concern that Congress should pass a legislative \n24  solution.  Similarly, Defendant Wolf offers no basis for his reservations relating to programmatic \n25  deferred action, which is belied by decades of deferred action policies.  See Regents I, 279 F. Supp. \n26  3d at 1021-22; Regents II, 908 F.3d at 488-89.  Finally, the concerns about “illegal immigration” \n27  including in the context of children are baseless, as Defendant Wolf acknowledges that DACA would \n28  not apply to those who arrive in the United States today.  At bottom, the Defendants fail to consider \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  25   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 28 of 29\n \n1  important aspects of the program such as the costs of the gutting the DACA program and the profound \n2  reliance interests engendered over the years. \n3  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court grant the following relief: \n5  (1)  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security violates \n6  the Homeland Security Act of 2016; \n7  (2)  Declare that Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security violates \n8  the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution; \n9  (3)  Declare that the actions that Defendants have taken to implement the Wolf and Edlow \n10  Memoranda are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of statutory authority, \n11  and otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the APA; \n12  (4)  Enjoin Defendants from altering or limiting the DACA program or engaging in any action \n13  to frustrate its full and continued implementation; \n14  (5)  Vacate the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda;  \n15  (6)  Award Plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses pursuant to any \n16  applicable law; and \n17  (7)  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require.  \n   \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nGibson, Dunn &  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCrutcher LLP \nCIVIL CASE NO.: 3:17-CV-05380-WHA \n  26   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 98   Filed 11/02/20   Page 29 of 29\n \n1  Respectfully submitted, \nDATED:  November 2, 2020   \n2  /s/ Theodore J.

Reg. 7053 (Jan. 25, 2021). In that memorandum, the President \n6  instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to “take \n7  all actions he deems appropriate, consistent with applicable law, to preserve and fortify DACA.” \n8  Id. at 7053.

For the reasons below, dismissal is DENIED and some provisional relief\n23\nis GRANTED. \n24\nSTATEMENT\n25\nIn 2012, the United States Department of Homeland Security adopted a program to\n26\npostpone deportation of undocumented immigrants brought to America as children and, pending\n27\naction in their cases, to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security\n28\nnumbers, pay taxes, and become part of the mainstream economy.  This program received the\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 2 of 49\n1 title “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” — DACA for short.  In 2017, however, after the\n2 national election and change in administrations, the agency eventually reversed itself and began\n3 a phase-out of DACA.  All agree that a new administration is entitled to replace old policies\n4 with new policies so long as they comply with the law.  One question presented in these related\n5 actions is whether the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather\n6 than in compliance with the law.\n7 1. HISTORY OF DEFERRED ACTION.\n8 At the core of these cases is an administrative practice known as “deferred action.” \n9 A primary question presented concerns the extent to which the Department of Homeland\n10 Security could lawfully use deferred action to implement DACA, and so it is important to review\nt 11 the history of deferred action as well as of other features of the DACA program.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Congress has the constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant thereto, Congress has established a comprehensive scheme governing\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 immigration and naturalization through the Immigration and Nationality Act.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 et seq.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is “charged with the administration and enforcement\nS N 16 of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” \nted  For the  17 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  The Secretary is further charged with “establishing national immigration\ni\nn\nU\n18 enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).   \n19 One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., deportation.  In turn,\n20 “[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration\n21 officials.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).  As an initial matter, in any given\n22 case, immigration officials “must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Ibid. \n23 At each stage of the removal process, they have “discretion to abandon the endeavor.”  Reno v.\n24 Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”).  \n25 Beginning as early as 1975, one way to exercise this discretion became “deferred action.” \n26 By deferred action, immigration officials could postpone, seemingly indefinitely, the removal of\n27 individuals unlawfully present in the United States “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the\n28\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 3 of 49\n1 Executive’s] own convenience.”  Id. at 483–84.  Immigration officials could also grant parole,\n2 temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure.  \n3 Some of these discretionary powers have flowed from statute.  Parole, for example,\n4 has allowed otherwise inadmissible aliens to temporarily enter the United States “for urgent\n5 humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Temporary\n6 protected status, also created by statute, has been available to nationals of designated foreign\n7 states affected by armed conflicts, environmental disasters, and other extraordinary conditions. \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  \n9 Some of these discretionary powers, however, have flowed from nonstatutory powers. \n10 Deferred enforced departure had no statutory basis but, instead, grew out of “the President’s\nt 11 constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations.”  USCIS, Adjudicator’s Field Manual\nr\nu\no a 12 § 38.2(a) (2014).  Nor has extended voluntary departure been anchored in any statute.  Rather,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 it has been recognized as part of the discretion of the Attorney General.  Hotel & Restaurant\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Employees Union, Local 25 v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc).  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Deferred action, originally known as “nonpriority” status, also began “without express\nS N 16 statutory authorization” but has since been recognized by the Supreme Court as a “regular\nted  For the  17 practice.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action by explicit\ni\nn\nU\n18 reference to it in the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2)):\n19 The denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under\nthis subsection shall not preclude the alien from applying for a stay\n20 of removal, deferred action, or a continuance or abeyance of\nremoval proceedings under any other provision of the immigration\n21 laws of the United States.\n22 Another federal statute, the REAL ID Act, also acknowledged deferred action.  REAL ID\n23 Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231.  This law provided that states could issue\n24 a temporary driver’s license or identification card to persons who can demonstrate an\n25 “authorized stay in the United States.”  Id. §§ 202(c)(2)(C)(i)–(ii).  Persons with “approved\n26 deferred action status” were expressly identified as being present in the United States during a\n27 “period of authorized stay,” for the purpose of issuing state identification cards.  Id. §§\n28 202(c)(2)(B)(viii), (C)(ii).  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 4 of 49\n1 Congress has also given the Executive Branch broad discretion to determine when\n2 noncitizens may work in the United States.  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053,\n3 1062 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Brewer I”); see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (defining an “unauthorized alien”\n4 not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident\n5 nor “authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security]”). \n6 Pursuant to this statutory authority, regulations promulgated in the 1980s allowed recipients of\n7 deferred action to apply for work authorization if they could demonstrate an “economic necessity\n8 for employment.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  \n9 The George W. Bush Administration began to use deferred action to mitigate a harsh\n10 statutory provision involving “unlawful presence.”  The Illegal Immigration Reform and\nt 11 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 created three- and ten-year bars on the admission of\nr\nu\no a 12 aliens who departed or were removed from the United States after periods of “unlawful\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 presence” of between 180 days and one year, or more than one year, respectively.  8 U.S.C.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).  It also imposed a permanent bar on the admission of any alien who,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 without being admitted, entered or attempted to reenter the United States after having been\nS N 16 unlawfully present for an aggregate period of more than one year.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). \nted  For the  17 Beginning in 2007, however, DHS regulations and policy guidance provided that deferred action\ni\nn\nU\n18 recipients did not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry. \n19 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2); Memorandum for Field Leadership,\n20 from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic Operations Directorate, USCIS,\n21 Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence for Purposes of Sections\n22 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009).  DHS excluded recipients\n23 of deferred action from being “unlawfully present” because their deferred action is a period of\n24 stay authorized by the government.  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059 (citing 8 U.S.C.\n25 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii)).  This nonaccrual practice arose well before DACA.1  \n26\n27\n1  Undocumented aliens do not begin to accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of\n28\nSection 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) until they reach the age of eighteen.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii).\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 5 of 49\n1 DACA grew out of a long agency history of discretionary relief programs.  In 1956, the\n2 Eisenhower Administration paroled roughly one thousand foreign-born orphans who had been\n3 adopted by American citizens but were precluded from entering the United States because of\n4 statutory quotas.  That same administration later granted parole to tens of thousands of\n5 Hungarian refugees after the unsuccessful Hungarian revolution.  Both programs flowed from\n6 presidential statements, and the programs later ended (in 1959 and 1958, respectively) when\n7 Congress passed laws enabling the paroled individuals to become lawful permanent residents\n8 (App. 1602–03, 1948–57; AR 33).2 \n9 In 1987, President Ronald Reagan instituted the Family Fairness Program, a non-\n10 statutory program that provided extended voluntary departure to children whose parents were in\nt 11 the process of legalizing their immigration status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nr\nu\no a 12 of 1986.  President George H.W. Bush extended the non-statutory program in 1990 to cover\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 spouses of such legalized aliens, and the program ultimately provided immigration relief to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 approximately 1.5 million people.  The need for the program ended with the passage of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration Act of 1990 (App. 1607, 1612–13, 1703).\nS N 16 On at least four occasions prior to the creation of DACA, immigration officials have\nted  For the  17 extended deferred action programs to certain classes of aliens, none of which programs was\ni\nn\nU\n18 expressly authorized by statute:  \n19 • In 1997, INS established a deferred action program for individuals\n20 self-petitioning for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of\n21 1994.  This program is still in place today.  As originally enacted, the\n22 Act did not mention deferred action, but instead provided a pathway\n23 to lawful permanent residency.  Deferred action allowed applicants\n24 to remain in the country pending a decision on their applications. \n25\n26\n2  “App.” refers to the appendix submitted in support of plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief (Dkt.\nNos. 113, 117–19, 121, 124).  In connection with their motion for provisional relief, plaintiffs seek judicial\n27\nnotice of thirty-nine exhibits submitted with the appendix (Dkt. No. 111-2).  The request is unopposed. \nThese exhibits consist of congressional testimony and government publications, memoranda, and press releases. \n28\nPlaintiffs’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED. \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 6 of 49\n1 Congress later expanded the deferred action program in the 2000\n2 VAWA reauthorization legislation (App. at 1640–46).\n3 • In 2002 and 2003, INS issued memoranda instructing officers to make\n4 deferred action assessments for T visa applicants (victims of human\n5 trafficking) and U visa applicants (victims of crimes such as domestic\n6 violence) (App. 1650–58).  These programs have since been codified in\n7 regulations promulgated by INS and DHS. 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(k)(1),\n8 (k)(4), (m)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2).\n9 • After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USCIS announced a deferred action\n10 program for certain foreign students (F-1 visa holders) who, because of\nt 11 the hurricane, could not satisfy the requirements of their student visas. \nr\nu\no a 12 In announcing the program, USCIS stated that “[t]he interim relief\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 [would] remain in effect until February 1, 2006” (App. 1661–62).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • In 2009, to fill a gap under the law, USCIS established a deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action program for widowed spouses who had been married to United\nS N 16 States citizens for less than two years.  Congress later eliminated the\nted  For the  17 statutory requirement that an alien be married to a United States citizen\ni\nn\nU\n18 for at least two years at the time of the citizen’s death to retain\n19 eligibility for lawful immigration status, and USCIS accordingly\n20 withdrew the deferred action program as “obsolete” (App. 1664–82). \n21 In sum, by the time DACA arrived in 2012, deferred action programs had become a\n22 well-accepted feature of the executive’s enforcement of our immigration laws, recognized as\n23 such by Congress and the Supreme Court. \n24 2. DACA.\n25 On June 15, 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a\n26 memorandum establishing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  Under DACA, immigrants\n27 brought to the United States as children could apply for deferred action for a two-year period,\n28 subject to renewal.  To qualify for DACA, an individual must:  (1) have come to the United\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 7 of 49\n1 States before the age of sixteen and been under the age of thirty-one on June 15, 2012;\n2 (2) have been present in the United States on June 15, 2012; (3) have been continuously residing\n3 in the United States for at least the prior five years; (4) have been enrolled in school, graduated\n4 from high school, obtained a GED, or been honorably discharged from the United States military\n5 or Coast Guard; and (5) not pose a threat to national security or public safety (AR 1).\n6 The 2012 DACA memo described the program as an exercise of “prosecutorial\n7 discretion.”  Secretary Napolitano found leniency “especially justified” for the DACA-eligible,\n8 whom she described as “productive young people” who “have already contributed to our country\n9 in significant ways.”  The memo further stated that these individuals “lacked the intent to violate\n10 the law” and were low priority cases for deportation (AR 1–2).\nt 11 DACA applicants had to pass a DHS background check and applications had to be\nr\nu\no a 12 “decided on a case by case basis.”  To apply for DACA, eligible individuals completed USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Form I-821D.  The application called for substantial personal information, such as biographical\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 information, date of entry into the United States, immigration status or lack thereof, educational\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 history, and all prior residential addresses since entering the United States.\nS N 16   Form I-821D also required substantial documentary support, including proof of identity\nted  For the  17 and proof of continuous residence in the United States through rent receipts, utility bills,\ni\nn\nU\n18 employment documents, or similar records.  Applicants also appeared at a USCIS field office\n19 to provide fingerprints, photographs, and signatures.  The form’s instructions stated (App. 1820):\n20 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nto ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the\n21 purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the\nrequestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear\n22 or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to\nAppear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be\n23 shared with national security and law enforcement agencies,\nincluding ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\n24 including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for\nchildhood arrivals request itself, to identify or prevent fraudulent\n25 claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or\nprosecution of a criminal offense.  The above information sharing\n26 clause covers family members and guardians, in addition to the\nrequestor.  \n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 8 of 49\n1 The form’s instructions also stated (App. 1808):\n2 Individuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into\nremoval proceedings or removed from the United States for a\n3 specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.\n4\nDACA applicants also submitted a Form I-765, Application for Employment\n5\nAuthorization, a Form I-765WS, Worksheet, and the accompanying fees.  To determine an\n6\napplicant’s eligibility for work authorization, USCIS reviewed the applicant’s current annual\n7\nincome, current annual expenses, and the total current value of his or her assets (App. 1762,\n8\n1801–21, 2067–87). \n9\nIf approved, the recipient received a Form I-797, Notice of Action, stating (App. 585):\n10\nUSCIS, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, has decided\nt 11 to defer action in your case.  Deferred action is an exercise of\nr\nu prosecutorial discretion by USCIS not to pursue the removal of an\no a 12 individual from the United States for a specific period.  Deferred\nC ni\n  or action does not confer or alter any immigration status.  \nct alif 13  \ni C\ntr of  Significantly, DHS could terminate a recipient’s deferred action at any time, at the\n Dis District  14 agency’s discretion, and DACA paved no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\ntates orthern  15 citizenship (App. 1774, 1808).  Secretary Napolitano concluded her DACA memorandum\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 (AR 1–3):\ni\nn This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status\nU\n18 or pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through its\nlegislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for the\n19 executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of\ndiscretion within the framework of the existing law.  I have done\n20 so here.\n21 But DACA did provide important benefits.  First, under pre-existing regulations, DACA\n22 recipients became eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action,\n23 thereby allowing them to obtain social security numbers and to become legitimate taxpayers and\n24 contributing members of our open economy.  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Second, deferred action\n25 provided a measure of safety for a period of two years from detention and removal, albeit always\n26 subject to termination at any time in any individual case.  Third, DACA recipients could apply\n27 for “advance parole” to obtain permission to travel overseas and be paroled back into the United\n28 States.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f).  Fourth, also pursuant to pre-existing regulations, DACA recipients\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 9 of 49\n1 avoided accrual of time for “unlawful presence” under the INA’s bar on re-entry.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1182(a)(9)(B)–(C) (establishing three-year, ten-year, and permanent bars on the admission\n3 of aliens after specified periods of “unlawful presence”). \n4 USCIS “strongly encourage[d]” DACA recipients to submit renewal requests between\n5 120 and 150 days before the expiration date-stamped on the recipient’s Form I-797.  According\n6 to the “Frequently Asked Questions” posted on the agency’s website, recipients were eligible for\n7 renewal under DACA so long as they:  (1) did not depart the United States on or after August 15,\n8 2012, without advance parole; (2) continuously resided in the United States since submitting\n9 their most recent DACA request; and (3) had not received criminal convictions (with minor\n10 exceptions).  Renewal requests did not require additional documentary support (App. 1756–57).\nt 11 The agency adopted DACA without any notice or opportunity for public comment.\nr\nu\no a 12 According to data published by USCIS, 793,026 applicants received deferred action\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 under DACA since its inception.  As of September 2017, there remained approximately 689,800\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 active DACA recipients.  Their average age was 23.8.  Based on a survey completed by\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Associate Professor Tom K. Wong in August 2017, 91 percent of DACA recipients had jobs,\nS N 16 and 45 percent of DACA recipients were enrolled in school (App. 1494–1522, 1533–52).  \nted  For the  17 3. THE DAPA LITIGATION.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 In 2014, DHS announced a different deferred action program for parents of United States\n19 citizens or lawful permanent residents, titled “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\n20 Lawful Permanent Residents” — shortened to the confusingly-similar acronym DAPA.  \n21 For our purposes, DAPA is important because the United States Court of Appeals for\n22 the Fifth Circuit promptly held that DAPA exceeded the statutory authority of DHS, a holding\n23 that eventually moved Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rule that DACA too had exceeded the\n24 agency’s authority.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). \n25 The 2014 DAPA memo directed USCIS “to establish a process, similar to DACA, for\n26 exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,”\n27 for aliens who had a son or daughter who was a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n28 resident and:  (1) were not an enforcement priority under DHS policy; (2) had continuously\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 10 of 49\n1 resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) had been physically present in the\n2 United States both when DHS announced DAPA and at the time of application to the program;\n3 and (4) presented “no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, [made] the grant of\n4 deferred action inappropriate” (AR 37–41).  \n5 That same 2014 announcement also expanded DACA in three minor ways:  (1) allowing\n6 otherwise eligible immigrants to apply for DACA even if they were older than 31 on the day\n7 DACA was earlier announced; (2) extending DACA renewals and work authorizations from\n8 two- to three-year periods; and (3) adjusting DACA’s date-of-entry requirement from June 15,\n9 2007, to January 1, 2010 (AR 37–41).  \n10 DAPA was also adopted without notice or opportunity for public comment. \nt 11 A coalition of twenty-six states immediately filed suit in the United States District Court\nr\nu\no a 12 for the Southern District of Texas to challenge DAPA.  The district court preliminarily enjoined\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 its implementation on the ground that DHS had failed to comply with the APA’s\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 notice-and-comment requirements.  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The district court’s order stated that “with three minor exceptions,” the case did not involve\nS N 16 DACA (id. at 606):\nted  For the  17 The Complaint in this matter does not include the actions taken by\ni\nn Secretary Napolitano, which have to date formalized the status of\nU\n18 approximately 700,000 teenagers and young adults.  Therefore,\nthose actions are not before the Court and will not be addressed\n19 by this opinion.  Having said that, DACA will necessarily be\ndiscussed in this opinion as it is relevant to many legal issues in\n20 the present case.  For example, the States maintain that the DAPA\napplications will undergo a process identical to that used for\n21 DACA applications and, therefore, DACA’s policies and\nprocedures will be instructive for the Court as to DAPA’s\n22 implementation.\n23 In holding that DAPA violated notice-and-comment procedures, the district court held\n24 that it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the status and employability of\n25 millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal government.”  It therefore should\n26 have been issued, the district court held, after notice and opportunity for public comment.  Id. at\n27 671.  Though the order focused on DAPA, it also preliminarily enjoined everything in the 2014\n28\n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 11 of 49\n1 memorandum, including the three minor ways in which DACA had been modified (but left alone\n2 the 2012 DACA program).  \n3 The Fifth Circuit affirmed in a split decision but added a further ground for affirmance. \n4 Texas, 809 F.3d at 178.  Over a dissent, the appellate panel added the ground that DAPA was\n5 substantively foreclosed by statute because the INA contained “an intricate process for illegal\n6 aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children’s immigration status,”\n7 and that DAPA, by providing “the benefits of lawful presence” to undocumented immigrants\n8 “solely on account of their children’s immigration status,” was inconsistent with this statutory\n9 scheme, which provided its own pathway for lawful presence to parents of children lawfully\n10 in the United States.  Id. at 179–80, 186.  The Fifth Circuit’s holding was also based on its\nt 11 observation that “the INA does not grant the Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and\nr\nu\no a 12 lawful presence on a class-wide basis to 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens.”  Id. at 186\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 n.202.  The decision was later affirmed without opinion by an equally divided Supreme Court. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam).3 \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In February 2017, DHS Secretary John Kelly issued guidance regarding the Trump\nS N 16 Administration’s immigration enforcement priorities.  Although the guidance rescinded “all\nted  For the  17 existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our\ni\nn\nU\n18 immigration laws and priorities for removal,” the 2012 DACA memo and 2014 DAPA memo\n19 were explicitly left in place.  The guidance also said that the 2014 DAPA memo would “be\n20 addressed in future guidance” (AR 229–34).  \n21 In June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded the 2014 DAPA memo, which rescission\n22 included the 2014 expansions of DACA.  He explained: \n23 I have considered a number of factors, including the preliminary\ninjunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA\n24 never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities. \nAfter consulting with the Attorney General, and in the exercise of\n25 my discretion in establishing national immigration enforcement\npolicies and priorities, I hereby rescind the November 20, 2014,\n26 memorandum. \n27\n28\n3  Such an affirmance has no precedential value.  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 192 (1972).  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 12 of 49\n1 Again, however, Secretary Kelly declared that the 2012 DACA memo would remain in effect\n2 (AR 235–37).  \n3 4. RESCISSION OF DACA.    \n4 Also in June 2017, ten of the twenty-six plaintiffs from the DAPA litigation wrote to\n5 Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand rescission of the 2012 DACA memo.  Their letter\n6 stated that if DACA was rescinded by September 5, they would dismiss the still-pending DAPA\n7 litigation.  Otherwise, the letter threatened to try to amend their complaint to additionally\n8 challenge the legality of DACA (AR 238–40).  \n9 A day before the deadline, the Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland\n10 Security Elaine Duke via a short letter that the Obama Administration had created DACA\nt 11 “without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated\nr\nu\no a 12 rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” and that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 therefore the program was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 The Attorney General’s letter also referenced the preliminary injunction against DAPA, then\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 stated that “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the\nS N 16 courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar\nted  For the  17 results with respect to DACA” (AR 251).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 The following day, without prior notice, the Acting Secretary rescinded DACA. \n19 The rescission was not based on any policy criticism.  Instead, it was based on the legal\n20 determination by the Attorney General.  The Acting Secretary explained that after “[t]aking into\n21 consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and\n22 the September 4, 2017, letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012,\n23 DACA program should be terminated.”  She said that “[r]ecognizing the complexities associated\n24 with winding down the program,” DHS would “provide a limited window” in which it would\n25 adjudicate certain requests, but that new DACA requests and applications for employment\n26 authorization would be rejected starting immediately.  DHS would adjudicate, on a case-by-case\n27 basis, DACA renewal requests received within thirty days from beneficiaries whose DACA\n28 status would expire before March 5, 2018.  She also instructed DHS to immediately stop\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 13 of 49\n1 approving new applications for advance parole.  The rescission left in place all extant grants of\n2 deferred action and work authorizations for the remainder of their validity periods (AR 252–56). \n3 Consequently, starting in March 2018, the DACA population will, over two years, dwindle down\n4 to zero. \n5 On the night of the rescission, President Trump called upon Congress specifically to\n6 enact DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n7 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!”  During an interview\n8 earlier in 2017, President Trump had stated “we are not after the dreamers, we are after the\n9 criminals” and that “the dreamers should rest easy” (App. 1852–53, 1958). \n10 In sum, the new administration didn’t terminate DACA on policy grounds.  It terminated\nt 11 DACA over a point of law, a pithy conclusion that the agency had exceeded its statutory and\nr\nu\no a 12 constitutional authority.  An important question now presented is whether that conclusion was a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 mistake of law.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 5. THE INSTANT LITIGATION.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Plaintiffs herein filed five related non-class lawsuits in this district, all now before the\nS N 16 undersigned judge.  The first commenced on September 8, brought by The Regents of the\nted  For the  17 University of California, on its own behalf and on behalf of its students, and Janet Napolitano,\ni\nn\nU\n18 in her official capacity as President of the University.  UC Plaintiffs allege they have invested\n19 considerable resources in recruiting students and staff who are DACA recipients, and that these\n20 individuals make important contributions to the University.  As DACA recipients lose their work\n21 authorizations, UC Plaintiffs allege that the University will lose significant intellectual capital\n22 and productivity.  They further allege that students who lose DACA protections will be unable\n23 “to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships and certain financial aid and\n24 scholarships, study abroad, or work to pay their tuition and other expenses,” and as a result may\n25 withdraw from the University altogether (UC Compl. ¶¶ 4–6, 34–37, 48–49).4 \n26\n27\n4  Two additional DACA lawsuits proceed in the Eastern District of New York before Judge Nicholas\nGaraufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case No. 16-cv-04756\n28\nNGG.\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 14 of 49\n1 On September 11, the States of California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota filed suit. \n2 Plaintiff States allege that they are home to more than 238,000 DACA recipients, and that the\n3 loss of their residents’ DACA status and work authorizations will injure their public colleges\n4 and universities, upset the States’ workforces, disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory\n5 interests, cause harm to hundreds of thousands of their residents, damage their economies,\n6 and hurt companies based in Plaintiff States (States Compl. ¶¶ 1–10).  \n7 The City of San Jose, on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees who are DACA\n8 recipients, filed its action on September 14.  San Jose alleges that it has hired DACA recipients\n9 into vital City jobs, that substantial resources were invested in training these employees, and that\n10 the City will be harmed when these employees are forced to leave the workforce (when they lose\nt 11 their work authorizations).  San Jose further alleges that it will continue to lose tax revenue as\nr\nu\no a 12 DACA recipients lose work authorizations and can no longer contribute to the City’s tax base\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 (San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 10, 28, 49–51). \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 On September 18, Individual DACA recipients Dulce Garcia, Miriam Gonzalez Avila,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Saul Jimenez Suarez, Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza, Norma Ramirez, and Jirayut\nS N 16 Latthivongskorn brought suit to challenge the termination of DACA.  Individual Plaintiffs work\nted  For the  17 and study in the fields of law, medicine, education, and psychology.  They allege that the loss of\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA will frustrate their professional goals and accomplishments.  They further allege that as a\n19 result of the rescission, they will lose access to numerous federal and state benefits, and may not\n20 be able to reside in the United States with their families.  They applied for DACA in reliance on\n21 the government’s representations that information provided under the program would not be\n22 used for purposes of immigration enforcement (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 4–9, 55, 59, 72, 78, 85, 95,\n23 128). \n24 Finally, the County of Santa Clara and the Service Employees International Union Local\n25 521 filed their complaint on October 10.  The County alleges that it employs DACA recipients,\n26 including union members, in key positions, such as in its In-Home Supportive Services Program\n27 and New Americans Fellowship Program.  The County alleges that it has expended time and\n28 money in training these employees, and that it relies on them to provide important services. \n14\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 15 of 49\n1 As DACA recipients leave the workforce, the County will lose important employees, will incur\n2 harm to its economy and suffer decreased tax revenue, and will incur the costs of increased\n3 dependency on subsidized health care and other County services.  Local 521 sues as an\n4 associational plaintiff on behalf of its members who are DACA recipients, and alleges that the\n5 Union’s organizational mission is to organize, represent, and empower employees, as well as\n6 mobilize immigration reform (Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 1, 15–20, 32, 37, 43–52). \n7 Collectively, plaintiffs assert the following claims: \n8 • The rescission violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it\n9 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in\n10 accordance with law (UC Compl. ¶¶ 50–58; State Compl. ¶¶ 152–55;\nt 11 Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 165–84; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 67–73).\nr\nu\no a 12 • The rescission violated the APA because it was a substantive rule that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 did not comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements or\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Regulatory Flexibility Act’s mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 604 that\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 an agency publish analysis of a rule’s impact on small businesses\nS N 16 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 59–66; State Compl. ¶¶ 146–63; San Jose Compl.\nted  For the  17 ¶¶ 59–63; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 177–84).\ni\nn\nU\n18 • The rescission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally-protected\n19 property and liberty interests without due process of law.  Plaintiffs also\n20 allege that the rescission violated due process because the government\n21 changed its policy regarding agency use of DACA-related information\n22 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 67–73; State Compl. ¶¶ 141–45; Garcia Compl.\n23 ¶¶ 133–47; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 59–66).\n24 • The rescission violates equal protection of the law because it was\n25 motivated by discriminatory animus and because it deprived DACA\n26 grantees of their substantial interests in supporting themselves and\n27 furthering their education (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77; San Jose Compl.\n28 ¶¶ 52–58; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 148–59; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 74–78).\n15\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 16 of 49\n1 • The rescission violates equitable estoppel.  DACA recipients provided\n2 detailed personal information to the government and rearranged their\n3 lives based on the government’s representations, but now face the\n4 possibility of removal.  Plaintiffs argue that the government should\n5 therefore be equitably estopped from terminating DACA or from using\n6 their DACA information for immigration enforcement purposes (State\n7 Compl. ¶¶ 164–71; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 192–99; Santa Clara Compl.\n8 ¶¶ 79–86).\n9 • Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the rescission was unlawful and an\n10 order restoring DACA (UC Compl. at 16, State Compl. at 35–36;\nt 11 San Jose Compl. at 15–16; Garcia Compl. at 43; Santa Clara Compl.\nr\nu\no a 12 at 26–27). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 On September 21, an initial case management conference occurred for all DACA actions\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 in our district.  At the conference, all counsel, including government counsel, presented a joint\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 proposal whereby the government would file the administrative record by October 13. \nS N 16 Significantly, although the government argued that discovery would be premature, it agreed to\nted  For the  17 submit the administrative record without any condition that it be done before any decision on its\ni\nn\nU\n18 threshold jurisdictional motion (presumably because it knew its jurisdictional motion would be\n19 premised on the administrative record) (see Dkt. No. 114 at 16; Tr. at 17:3, 22:2).  The Court\n20 made only slight revisions to the joint proposal, all in aid of a stated goal of providing a full\n21 record and final decision for our court of appeals prior to the March 5 expiration date.  Pursuant\n22 to FRCP 26, a case management order then set a October 6 deadline for the government to file\n23 the administrative record, set a briefing schedule for the parties’ motions to dismiss, for\n24 provisional relief, or for summary judgment, and permitted the parties to proceed with\n25 reasonable, limited, and narrowly-directed discovery (Dkt. No. 49).\n26 The government filed an administrative record on October 6.  It was merely, however,\n27 fourteen documents comprising 256 pages of which 187 consisted of published opinions from\n28 the DAPA litigation, and all of which already resided in the public domain.  All non-public\n16\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 17 of 49\n1 materials, some eighty-four documents, actually reviewed by the Acting Secretary remained\n2 withheld as privileged (Dkt. No. 71).  In other words, of the ninety-eight DACA-related\n3 documents personally considered by the decisionmaker, all but the fourteen already known to\n4 the public were withheld as privileged.  Although government counsel further indicated, upon\n5 inquiry by the district judge, that the decisionmaker had also likely received verbal input,\n6 nothing was included in the administrative record to capture this input.  Nor were there any\n7 materials regarding the agency’s earlier, recent decisions to leave DACA in place.  \n8 On October 9, plaintiffs moved to require the government to complete the administrative\n9 record, seeking all materials considered directly or indirectly by the Acting Secretary in\n10 reaching her decision to rescind DACA, which motion was granted in part and denied in part. \nt 11 The government, having earlier consented to filing the administrative record, was ordered to\nr\nu\no a 12 keep its word and to file a complete administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 65, 79–80).\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Instead, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus with our court of appeals,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 seeking relief from having to complete the administrative record until after its jurisdictional\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 arguments were determined, a turnabout from its earlier voluntary proposal and stipulation to\nS N 16 file the administrative record as part of an agreed-upon schedule.  After full briefing and oral\nted  For the  17 argument, our court of appeals denied the government’s mandamus petition and vacated the\ni\nn\nU\n18 stay (over one dissent).5  \n19 The government was again ordered to complete the administrative record, this time by\n20 November 22, later extended to December 22 to accommodate the government’s claim of\n21 burden.  On December 1, however, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus and\n22 application for a stay in the United States Supreme Court.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court did\n23 not reach the merits of the government’s petition but required that defendants’ jurisdictional\n24 defenses be adjudicated prior to consideration of discovery or completing the administrative\n25\n5  Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the government’s petition\n26\nfor a writ of mandamus to stay an order to supplement the same administrative record.  The court of appeals\nfound that there was “a strong suggestion that the record before the District Court was not complete” and, noting\n27\nthat nearly 200 pages of the record consisted of published opinions from various federal courts, “[i]t is difficult\nto imagine that a decision as important as whether to repeal DACA would be made based upon a factual record\n28\nof little more than 56 pages, even accepting that litigation risk was the reason for repeal.”  In Re: Kirstjen M.\nNielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d. Cir. Dec. 27, 2017).\n17\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 18 of 49\n1 record (Dkt. Nos. 86, 188, 197, 214, 224), a decision the district judge himself might have made\n2 at the outset save for the government’s own proposal and agreement to file the administrative\n3 record in October. \n4 Consequently, this action has proceeded on the incomplete administrative record\n5 initially filed by the government.  Plaintiffs have been forced to draw on other materials. \n6 Ironically, even the government in these motions relies on material outside of the administrative\n7 record to defend the agency decision (Dkt. No. 204 at 10, 12, 19–20).  The parties have now\n8 fully briefed motions to dismiss and a motion for provisional relief, all argued on December 20\n9 (Dkt. Nos. 111, 114).  This order now follows.\n10 ANALYSIS\nt 11 1. MOTION TO DISMISS.\nr\nu\no a 12 Defendants raise three jurisdictional arguments under FRCP 12(b)(1).  First, they argue\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 that the decision to rescind DACA was a discretionary act barred from judicial review under\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the APA.  Second, they contend that the INA bars judicial review.  Third, although defendants\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 concede that Individual Plaintiffs have standing, they contend that no others do.  Each is\nS N 16 now addressed in turn.  A separate order will consider defendants’ motion to dismiss under\nted  For the  17 FRCP 12(b)(6).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. The DACA Rescission Was Not Committed \nTo Agency Discretion by Law.\n19\nCongress has instructed our district courts to review and set aside agency action found\n20\nto be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n21\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Under the APA, however, our district courts lack subject-matter\n22\njurisdiction to review agency action that is “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C.\n23\n§ 701(a)(2).  \n24\nIn Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), the\n25\nSupreme Court explained that the jurisdictional bar of Section 701(a)(2) is “very narrow” and\n26\n“applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given\n27\ncase there is no law to apply.”  The Supreme Court held that because the statute there at issue\n28\ncontained “clear and specific directives” guiding the agency’s decision, there was “‘law to\n18\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 19 of 49\n1 apply,’ so the exemption for action ‘committed to agency discretion’ [was] inapplicable.”  Id. at\n2 411–13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n3 When it next revisited the exception in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985),\n4 the Supreme Court reiterated that the exception applies only where “the statute is drawn so\n5 that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise\n6 of discretion.”  There, condemned inmates asked the FDA to bring an enforcement action to\n7 prevent purported violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through the\n8 administration of death-penalty drugs.  The FDA Commissioner, however, refused to do so on\n9 the ground that the FDA lacked jurisdiction and otherwise should not interfere with the state\n10 criminal justice system.  Skipping over the agency jurisdiction issue, the Supreme Court held\nt 11 that such decisions not to prosecute or initiate enforcement actions are generally not reviewable\nr\nu\no a 12 as they are “committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id. at 824–25, 831. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Chaney identified several characteristics of non-enforcement decisions as key to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 its holding.  First, non-enforcement decisions require a complicated balancing of factors\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 “peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including whether “resources are best spent on\nS N 16 this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular\nted  For the  17 enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies, and . . . whether the agency\ni\nn\nU\n18 has enough resources to undertake the action at all.”  Id. at 831.  Second, in refusing to act,\n19 an agency “does not exercise its coercive power over an individual’s liberty” and accordingly\n20 “does not infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.”  Id. at 832.  When an\n21 agency does act to enforce, however, that action itself provides a focus for judicial review,\n22 inasmuch as the agency must have exercised its power in some manner.  Third, a refusal to\n23 institute enforcement proceedings is similar to a prosecutor’s decision not to indict, which\n24 decision “has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Ibid.  \n25 Our case is different from Chaney.  There, the agency simply refused to initiate an\n26 enforcement proceeding.  Here, by contrast, the agency has ended a program which has existed\n27 for five years affecting 689,800 enrollees.  Importantly, major policy decisions are “quite\n28 different from day-to-day agency nonenforcement decisions.”  National Treasury Employees\n19\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 20 of 49\n1 Union v. Horner, 854 F.2d 490, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Rather, broad enforcement policies “are\n2 more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the substantive statute rather than\n3 the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive an individual enforcement\n4 decision.”  Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \n5 Even defendants concede that where “the agency’s interpretation of a statute is embedded in a\n6 non-reviewable enforcement policy, the former may be reviewable as such” (Dkt. No. 218 at 3\n7 n.4).  Although they contend that the rescission memorandum “does not contain an embedded\n8 interpretation of the INA,” that assertion is incompatible with the Acting Secretary’s explicit\n9 references to the INA and the Attorney General’s determination that DACA was effectuated\n10 without “statutory authority.”  The first and third Chaney factors, accordingly, do not apply to\nt 11 the instant case.6  \nr\nu\no a 12 Chaney is also distinguishable because, unlike there, here the government reversed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 course after five years of inviting DACA recipients out of the shadows.  In contrast to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 nonenforcement decisions, “rescissions of commitments, whether or not they technically\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 implicate liberty and property interests as defined under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,\nS N 16 exert much more direct influence on the individuals or entities to whom the repudiated\nted  For the  17 commitments were made.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Through\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA, the government has invited undocumented aliens who meet threshold criteria to step\n19 forward, disclose substantial personal information, pay a hefty fee, and comply with ongoing\n20 conditions, all in expectation of (though not a right to) continued deferred action.  DACA\n21 allows enrollees to better plan their careers and lives with a reduced fear of removal.  DACA\n22 work authorizations, for example, allow recipients to join in the mainstream economy (and pay\n23 taxes).  DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least,\n24 if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good\n25 behavior.  This has become an important program for DACA recipients and their families, for\n26\n6  Contrary to defendants, Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir. 1990), is distinguishable\n27\non its facts.  There, the Fifth Circuit addressed a class action stemming from the Immigration and Naturalization\nService’s failure to adjudicate requests for voluntary departure.  The court of appeals determined that the district\n28\ncourt had improperly issued an injunction directing INS to consider particular grounds in deciding individual\nrequests for voluntary departure and employment authorization.  Id. at 1046.  \n20\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 21 of 49\n1 the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy.  An agency action to\n2 terminate it bears no resemblance to an agency decision not to regulate something never before\n3 regulated. \n4 Finally, there is law to apply.  The main, if not exclusive, rationale for ending DACA\n5 was its supposed illegality.  But determining illegality is a quintessential role of the courts.7  \n6 B. The INA Does Not Bar Review.\n7 The principle that courts owe substantial deference to the immigration determinations of\n8 the political branches is important and undisputed.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162\n9 (9th Cir. 2017).  That deference, however, does not remove the decision to rescind DACA from\n10 the ambit of judicial review.  Rather, the Supreme Court has applied the “strong presumption\nt 11 in favor of judicial review of administration action” in the immigration context.  See INS v.\nr\nu\no a 12 St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298–99 (2001). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In this connection, defendants raise two arguments.  First, they contend that review\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of discretionary enforcement decisions results in the inappropriate delay of removal, and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 accordingly prolongs violations of our immigration laws.  This argument, however, again\nS N 16 ignores that plaintiffs do not challenge any particular removal but, rather, challenge the abrupt\nted  For the  17 end to a nationwide deferred-action and work-authorization program.  In any individual case,\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA allows DHS to revoke deferred status and to deport.  Second, defendants assert that\n19 review of such decisions may involve disclosure of law enforcement priorities and\n20 foreign-policy objectives.  Neither concern is implicated here, as defendants’ stated reasons\n21 for the rescission all relate to the across-the-board cancellation of DACA based on supposed\n22 illegality, not to the facts particular to any proposed removal. \n23\n24\n25\n26\n7  Defendants are correct, of course, that a presumptively unreviewable agency action does not become\n27\nreviewable simply because “the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable action.”  ICC v.\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’s, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987).  As discussed above, however, the rescission of DACA\n28\nwas not such an unreviewable decision.\n21\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 22 of 49\n1 Nor does Section 1252(g) bar judicial review of the agency action in question.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1252(g) provides:\n3 Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . no court shall have\n4 jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\narising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to\n5 commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal\norders against any alien under this chapter.  \n6\nAs explained by the Supreme Court, this provision applies only to the three discrete\n7\ndecisions or actions named in Section 1252(g).  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.  Plaintiffs’ claims do\n8\nnot involve such decisions, but rather the challenge here is to the across-the-board cancellation\n9\nof a nationwide program.8 \n10\nDefendants recognize that these actions were brought prior to the commencement of\nt 11\nr\nu any removal proceedings.  Nevertheless, they argue that Section 1252(g) precludes review of\no a 12\nC ni\n  or plaintiffs’ claims because the decision to discontinue deferred action is “an ingredient to the\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  commencement of enforcement proceedings.”  It is true that eliminating DACA draws its\n Dis District  14 enrollees one step closer to deportation, but the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\ntates orthern  15 Section 1252(g) somehow precludes review of the “many other decisions or actions that may be\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 part of the deportation process.”  As AADC emphasized, “[i]t is implausible that the mention of\ni\nn three discrete events along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of referring to all claims\nU\n18\narising from deportation proceedings.”  Ibid.  \n19\nDefendants cite two decisions.  Importantly, however, both stemmed from already-\n20\ncommenced deportation or removal proceedings.  See Botezatu v. I.N.S., 195 F.3d 311, 312\n21\n(7th Cir. 1999) (declining to review a decision to deny deferred action after plaintiff had been\n22\nfound deportable); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 899–900 (3d Cir. 2016) (district court\n23\nlacked jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petition that claimed plaintiff was improperly denied\n24\nDACA relief).  \n25\nBy comparison, our court of appeals has held, following AADC, that Section 1252(g)\n26\ndoes not bar review of actions that occur “prior to any decision to ‘commence proceedings.’” \n27\n28\n8  The district court in Batalla Vidal also concluded that Section 1252(g) did not bar judicial review of\nchallenges to the DACA rescission.  Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 2017 WL 5201116, at *13.\n22\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 23 of 49\n1 Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 965 (9th Cir. 2004).  The claims in Kwai Fun\n2 Wong challenged the revocation of the plaintiff’s parole without first deciding her application\n3 for immigration relief, conduct which “resulted in the INS’s decision to commence removal\n4 proceedings and ultimately to remove” the plaintiff from the United States.  Id. at 959, 964. \n5 Contrary to defendants, it is immaterial that Kwai Fun Wong did not involve deferred action,\n6 as both the revocation of parole and the revocation of deferred action are “an ingredient” to the\n7 commencement of enforcement proceedings.  The jurisdictional limits of Section 1252(g) were\n8 instead “directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal\n9 proceedings.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.\n10 C. Most Plaintiffs Have Standing.\nt 11 To establish standing, Article III of the United States Constitution requires plaintiffs\nr\nu\no a 12 to show “(1) they suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 560–61 (1992)).  The standing inquiry is focused on whether the plaintiff has a sufficient\nS N 16 personal stake in the outcome of the controversy to ensure that the parties will be truly adverse\nted  For the  17 and their legal presentations sharpened.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).  Standing\ni\nn\nU\n18 must be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352\n19 (2006).\n20 Defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs have standing.  Rather, they argue\n21 in brief that the entity plaintiffs (the state and local governments, UC Plaintiffs, and SEIU Local\n22 521) lack Article III standing because the rescission does not regulate or restrict them in any\n23 way.  Defendants therefore posit that the entity plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are due only to\n24 “incidental effects” of the rescission, which defendants contend are insufficient to establish\n25 injury-in-fact.  As set forth below, these arguments lack merit.  \n26 First, California, Maryland, the City of San Jose, and the County of Santa Clara each\n27 employ DACA recipients, in connection with whom they have invested substantial resources\n28 in hiring and training.  Plaintiffs allege that they will not only lose these employees as work\n23\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 24 of 49\n1 authorizations expire, but that they will also need to expend additional resources to hire and train\n2 replacements.  San Jose further alleges that as a result of the rescission, the City has had\n3 decreased productivity, and that it has had to expend time and resources to deal with decreased\n4 employee morale (States Compl. ¶¶ 26–27, 32, 53; San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 49–50; Santa Clara\n5 Compl. ¶¶ 32–37; App. 11, 95–97, 706–07, 798, 1575–76). \n6 Second, Plaintiff States, including Maine and Maryland, stand to lose significant tax\n7 revenue as a result of the rescission (States Compl. ¶¶ 28–30, 37, 49–50, 70–71).  Although\n8 general allegations of injury to a state’s economy and the associated decline in general tax\n9 revenues may not be sufficient to establish standing, here, Plaintiff States sufficiently allege a\n10 “direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.”  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S.\nt 11 437, 448 (1992).  They allege, for example, that Maine stands to lose $96,000 in annual state\nr\nu\no a 12 and local taxes as DACA recipients leave the workforce (States Compl. ¶¶ 30, 38).  Evidence\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 submitted by plaintiffs supports these allegations, and demonstrates that DACA’s rescission\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 would reduce state and local tax contributions by DACA-eligible individuals by at least half\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (App. 68–74, 218–30). \nS N 16 Third, the University of California has also established that it will suffer injury to its\nted  For the  17 proprietary interests.  As declarations submitted by the University demonstrate, the rescission\ni\nn\nU\n18 has harmed the University in multiple ways.  Because DACA recipients can no longer seek\n19 advance parole, these students are unable to travel outside of the United States for research and\n20 educational conferences.  DACA recipients have also decided to cancel their enrollment in the\n21 University, and additional recipients are at risk of dropping out, because they would not be able\n22 to pay the cost of attendance without work authorizations. The University has also invested\n23 resources in recruiting and retaining DACA recipients as employees in various roles, including\n24 as teaching assistants and health care providers.  Such investments would be lost should these\n25 employees lose their ability to work in the United States.  \n26 California, Maryland, and Minnesota also allege injury to their public universities\n27 through harm to their educational missions and the loss of students and teachers.  According to\n28 the declarations filed by plaintiffs, the rescission, and the resulting loss of work authorization\n24\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 25 of 49\n1 and potential for deportation, will adversely impact the diversity of the talent pool of potential\n2 students, which will make it more difficult for the universities to fulfill their missions of\n3 increasing diversity (States Compl. ¶¶ 27, 55, 64–66; App. 12–16, 496–514, 884–90).  Our court\n4 of appeals recently affirmed the standing of two state governments to challenge an immigration\n5 policy that similarly harmed the plaintiffs’ public universities.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d\n6 1151, 1160–01 (9th Cir. 2017).  These injuries accordingly give the University of California and\n7 the States of California, Maryland, and Minnesota Article III standing.  Ibid. (citing Singleton v.\n8 Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114–16 (1976)).9\n9 Fourth, State Plaintiffs Maryland and Minnesota further allege that the rescission will\n10 negatively impact their public health programs.  In particular, Maryland and Minnesota allege\nt 11 that rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their employer-based health\nr\nu\no a 12 insurance, imposing higher healthcare costs on the state (State Compl. ¶¶ 51, 62).  These injuries\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are also sufficient to confer Article III standing.10  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Finally, SEIU Local 521 has associational standing to bring its claims on behalf of its\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 members who are DACA recipients.  An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nS N 16 members when:  (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right;\nted  For the  17 (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the\ni\nn\nU\n18 claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\n19 lawsuit.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock,\n20\n21\n9  The public universities of California, Maryland, and Minnesota are branches of the states under state\nlaw.  Campbell v. Regents of Univ. of California, 35 Cal. 4th 311, 321 (2005); Hanauer v. Elkins, 217 Md. 213,\n22\n219, 141 A.2d 903, 906 (Md. 1958); Univ. of Minn. v. Raygor, 620 N.W.2d 680, 683 (Minn. 2001).  \n23\n10  Although not discussed by the parties, the District of Columbia Circuit held that Joe Arpaio, Sheriff\nof Maricopa County, Arizona, lacked Article III standing to challenge DACA.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11\n24 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  While the court of appeals found that the plaintiff’s alleged harm — increased spending on\ncriminal investigation, apprehension, and incarceration — was sufficiently concrete, his theory that DACA\n25\nwould lead to an increased number of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in his jurisdiction was too\nspeculative.  Id. at 19–20.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs allege that the rescission will cause DACA recipients to\n26\nlose their work authorizations, and that plaintiffs will lose employees and students, suffer decreased tax revenue,\nand otherwise incur increased costs as a direct result.  This case is also different from Crane v. Johnson,\n27\n783 F.3d 244, 252 (5th Cir. 2015), where the Fifth Circuit held that Mississippi lacked standing to challenge\nDACA because it failed to submit evidence that DACA eligible immigrants resided in the state.  Defendants do\n28\nnot dispute State Plaintiffs’ allegations that hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients live in Plaintiff States.  \n25\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 26 of 49\n1 477 U.S. 274, 282 (1986) (quoting Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n,\n2 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  SEIU has established all three elements here.  SEIU has members\n3 who are DACA recipients.  Its constitution states that part of its mission is to provide its\n4 members with a voice in the larger community, and that its members should be treated equally\n5 with dignity regardless of immigration status or national origin.  SEIU has also formed a\n6 Committee on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a member-based committee that engages in\n7 organizing, advocacy, and education to help undocumented workers.  Its members’ interests in\n8 these actions are therefore germane to SEIU’s stated purpose (App. 801–09).  Furthermore, this\n9 action does not require the participation of SEIU’s individual members.  \n10 Defendants, in arguing that the entity plaintiffs lack standing, rely solely on Linda R.S. v.\nt 11 Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973).  There, the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a Texas\nr\nu\no a 12 state court’s interpretation of a child support statute.  Ibid.  The Supreme Court held that,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 although the plaintiff had alleged an injury, she had not shown “a direct nexus between the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 vindication of her interest and the enforcement of the State’s criminal laws” because the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 relationship between the state’s decision not to prosecute and the father’s decision not to pay\nS N 16 under the statute could “at best, be termed only speculative.”  Id. at 618–19.  Linda R.S. has no\nted  For the  17 application here.  As explained above, the entity plaintiffs have alleged harm to their proprietary\ni\nn\nU\n18 interests as a direct result of defendants’ decision to terminate the DACA program, most notably\n19 through its termination of work authorizations.  Accordingly, the entity plaintiffs have\n20 sufficiently alleged injury-in-fact traceable to the termination of DACA, and have demonstrated\n21 that these harms are redressable by their requested relief.11 \n22 Turning to prudential standing under the APA, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered\n23 or will suffer sufficient injury-in-fact, and that “the interest[s] sought to be protected by the\n24 complainant [are] arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the\n25 statute . . . in question.”  Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.\n26 479, 488 (1998).  \n27\n11  Because defendants’ conduct imposes direct injury on the State Plaintiffs’ proprietary interests, this\n28\norder need not reach defendants’ argument that the State Plaintiffs lack standing as parens patriae.\n26\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 27 of 49\n1 A plaintiff that is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action lacks prudential\n2 standing only where its interests “are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\n3 implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\n4 suit.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987).  This test is “not meant to be\n5 especially demanding,” and must be applied “in keeping with Congress’s evident intent when\n6 enacting the APA to make agency action presumably reviewable.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n7 Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quotations and citations\n8 omitted).  \n9 The parties’ briefs include only a cursory discussion of plaintiffs’ prudential standing\n10 under the APA.  Again, defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs also have\nt 11 statutory standing.  SEIU, which asserts the rights of its members who are DACA recipients,\nr\nu\no a 12 likewise seeks the protection of interests regulated by the INA.  Not all of the entity plaintiffs,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 however, have established prudential standing to proceed on their APA claims.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Plaintiffs primarily rely on our court of appeals’ recent decision in Hawaii v. Trump,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 859 F.3d 741, 765 (9th Cir. 2017), as well as on various provisions of the INA which provide for\nS N 16 student- and employment-related immigrant visas.  Plaintiffs do not contend, however, that their\nted  For the  17 DACA-recipient students or employees qualify for such visas.  Nor do plaintiffs point to\ni\nn\nU\n18 any provisions of the INA which indicate a protected interest in enrolling students with deferred\n19 action in their schools or universities.  Plaintiffs are also unable to point to any provision of the\n20 INA indicating that Congress intend to protected Plaintiff States’ interests in maintaining income\n21 tax revenue or avoiding increased healthcare costs.  \n22 By contrast, local and state governments San Jose, Santa Clara, California, and\n23 Maryland, as well as the University of California, have all identified injuries resulting from their\n24 status as employers, and allege harm caused by their employees’ future loss of deferred action\n25 and associated work authorization.  The INA gives the Executive Branch broad discretion to\n26 determine when noncitizens may work in the United States, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3), and\n27 regulations promulgated pursuant to this authority allow recipients of deferred action to apply\n28 for work authorization if they can demonstrate an “economic necessity for employment.” \n27\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 28 of 49\n1 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Moreover, the INA contains detailed provisions which subject\n2 employers to criminal and civil liability for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens, see 8 U.S.C.\n3 § 1324a(a)(1)(A), and for “continu[ing] to employ the alien in the United States knowing\n4 the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment,” id.\n5 § 1324a(a)(2).  The work authorization document that the agency issues to DACA recipients\n6 is one of the documents that is acceptable for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification,\n7 which employers must complete and retain for each individual they hire for employment in the\n8 United States (App. 2061–62).  Plaintiffs’ interest in their employees’ continued authorization\n9 to work in the United States is therefore “arguably within the zone of interests” that the INA\n10 protects.  Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 765; Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at 488.12\nt 11 Accordingly, even though the zone of interests inquiry is not demanding, this order\nr\nu\no a 12 concludes that Maine and Minnesota’s interests are “so marginally related” to the purposes\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 implicit in the INA that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 suit.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are accordingly DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The remaining entity plaintiffs, however, have established that their interests that support\nS N 16 Article III standing also satisfy the APA’s zone of interests test.  \nted  For the  17 *                        *                        *\ni\nn\nU\n18 Apart from the holding that Maine and Minnesota do not have statutory standing, the\n19 foregoing rejects all of the government’s jurisdictional arguments to dismiss plaintiffs’\n20 challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n21 2. PROVISIONAL RELIEF.\n22 Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to restore DACA.  To support a preliminary\n23 injunction, plaintiffs must establish four elements:  (1) likelihood of success on the merits;\n24 (2) irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in\n25\n26 12  Defendants’ sole argument against the entity plaintiffs’ prudential standing is that no provision\nof the INA protects the entity plaintiffs from “bearing the incidental effects” of a denial of deferred action. \n27\nThe case on which defendants rely, however, dealt with a private anti-immigration organization whose members\nwere not impacted by the immigration policy at issue.  See Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno,\n28 93 F.3d 897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 29 of 49\n1 their favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Resources\n2 Defense Council Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  As now explained, the record warrants most of the\n3 provisional relief requested.  \n4 A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n5 Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the rescission\n6 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with law. \n7 Specifically, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that:  (1) the agency’s decision to\n8 rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise; and (2) government counsel’s supposed\n9 “litigation risk” rationale is a post hoc rationalization and would be, in any event, arbitrary and\n10 capricious.\nt 11 (1) The Rescission was Based on a Flawed Legal Premise.\nr\nu\no a 12 The agency action was “not in accordance with law” because it was based on the flawed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 legal premise that the agency lacked authority to implement DACA.  When agency action is\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 based on a flawed legal premise, it may be set as aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532\nS N 16 (setting aside the EPA’s denial of a petition for rulemaking under the Clean Air Act for\nted  For the  17 supposed lack of authority); Safe Air for Everyone v. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007). \ni\nn\nU\n18 This order holds that DACA fell within the agency’s enforcement authority.  The contrary\n19 conclusion was flawed and should be set aside.  \n20 The administrative record includes the 2014 determination of the Office of Legal Counsel\n21 of the United States Department of Justice that programmatic deferred action is a permissible\n22 exercise of DHS’s enforcement discretion.  OLC noted that deferred action programs such as\n23 DACA are permissible so long as immigration officials retain discretion to evaluate each\n24 application on an individualized basis and so long as the concerns animating the program were\n25 consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration\n26 enforcement discretion.  OLC recognized that the “practice of granting deferred action date[d]\n27 back several decades,” and that “Congress has long been aware of the practice of granting\n28 deferred action, including in its categorical variety, and of its salient features; and it has never\n29\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 30 of 49\n1 acted to disapprove or limit the practice.”  Indeed, not only has Congress not limited the practice,\n2 but it has “enacted several pieces of legislation that have either assumed that deferred action\n3 would be available in certain circumstances, or expressly directed that deferred action be\n4 extended to certain categories of aliens” (AR 15–27). \n5 As explained in OLC’s opinion, each feature of the DACA program is anchored in\n6 authority granted or recognized by Congress or the Supreme Court.  Because this is the heart\n7 of the problem, and with apology for some repetition, this order will now examine each feature\n8 in turn.  \n9 The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible under the INA for “establishing\n10 national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  The Secretary is\nt 11 also charged with the administration and enforcement of the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1103.  In making\nr\nu\no a 12 immigration enforcement decisions, the executive “considers a variety of factors such as the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 danger posed to the United States of an individual’s unlawful presence, the impact of removal\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 on the nation’s international relations, and the ‘human concerns’ of whether the individual ‘has\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished\nS N 16 military service.’”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Arizona v. United\nted  For the  17 States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012)).  In instituting DACA, Secretary Napolitano explained that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the program was “necessary to ensure that [DHS’s] enforcement resources are not expended on\n19 [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement\n20 priorities” (AR 1).13\n21 As set forth above, deferred action originated without any statutory basis apart from the\n22 discretion vested by Congress in connection with the agency’s enforcement of the immigration\n23 laws.  Over the decades, however, deferred action became such a fixture that Congress referred\n24 to it by name in several INA amendments.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2) (stating that U visa\n25 and T visa applicants who were denied an administrative stay of removal were not precluded\n26 from applying for “deferred action”); 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (stating that eligible\n27\n13  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not reach the merits of\n28\nSheriff Joe Arpaio’s challenges to DACA and DAPA but instead dismissed the case for lack of Article III\nstanding.  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 15.\n30\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 31 of 49\n1 derivatives of VAWA petitioners were eligible for “deferred action” and work authorization); 8\n2 U.S.C. § 1151 note (stating that certain immediate family members of certain United States\n3 citizens “shall be eligible for deferred action”).  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action\n4 in enactments outside of the INA.  See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 30301 note (specifying that evidence of\n5 lawful status includes proof of “deferred action status”); USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L.\n6 No. 107-56, § 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (stating that immediate family members of legal\n7 permanent residents killed on September 11, 2001 “may be eligible for deferred action”). \n8 Congress has been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action,\n9 but it has yet to do so.  \n10 The Supreme Court has recognized the authority of DHS to grant relief from removal,\nt 11 Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396, and has specifically recognized deferred action as a way to exercise\nr\nu\no a 12 that discretion — “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the Executive’s] own convenience.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Notably, our court of appeals has said that “the exercise of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 prosecutorial discretion in deferred action flows from the authority conferred on the Secretary by\n  Di\nStates Northern  1156 IthI”e) .I1N4 A  .”  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 968 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Brewer\nted  For the  17 In extending programmatic deferred action to DACA enrollees, the agency acted within\ni\nn\nU\n18 the scope of this long and recognized practice.  In the exercise of its enforcement discretion and\n19 policy-making, the agency simply found that DACA enrollees represented low priority cases\n20 for removal and instituted DACA to manage that population while it redirected its resources\n21 elsewhere.  Even for enrollees approved under the program, DHS expressly retained the\n22 authority to terminate their deferred action at any time, in the agency’s discretion.  DACA\n23 provided no guarantee against removal.  \n24 Nevertheless, DACA has provided recipients with a major benefit, namely work\n25 authorizations for the period of deferral upon a demonstration of economic need.  This has\n26\n27\n14  In Brewer II, our court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  Circuit Judge Kozinski,\njoined by five other Circuit Judges, filed a dissent to the denial of the petition, expressing the view that DACA\n28\ndid not preempt Arizona’s law refusing to issue drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients.  855 F.3d at 958–62.\n31\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 32 of 49\n1 allowed DACA recipients to become part of the mainstream workforce and contribute openly\n2 to our economy.  Significantly, Section 1324a(h)(3) defines an “unauthorized alien” not entitled\n3 to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident nor “authorized\n4 to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”  In turn, the\n5 Secretary of Homeland Security has allowed work authorizations in cases of deferred action\n6 under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  As our court of appeals has stated, “the Executive Branch has\n7 determined that deferred action recipients — including DACA recipients — are ordinarily\n8 authorized to work in the United States.”  See Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1062.  \n9 It is also within the lawful authority of the agency to determine that DACA recipients\n10 do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry.  Pursuant to\nt 11 pre-existent DHS regulations and policy guidance, deferred action recipients already avoided\nr\nu\no a 12 accrual of “unlawful presence.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2);\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Memorandum for Field Leadership, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Operations Directorate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 for Purposes of Sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009). \nS N 16 Importantly, DHS excludes recipients of deferred action from being “unlawfully present”\nted  For the  17 because their deferred action is considered a period of stay authorized by the government.  See 8\ni\nn\nU\n18 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present if the alien is present “in\n19 the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\n20 [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]”); Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059.\n21 Allowing DACA recipients to apply for and obtain advance parole to travel overseas and\n22 return to the United States is also in accord with pre-existing regulations.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f);\n23 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (the Attorney General [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]\n24 may “in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he\n25 may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public\n26 benefit”).\n27 In short, what exactly is the part of DACA that oversteps the authority of the agency? \n28 Is it the granting of deferred action itself?  No, deferred action has been blessed by both the\n32\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 33 of 49\n1 Supreme Court and Congress as a means to exercise enforcement discretion.  Is it the granting\n2 of deferred action via a program (as apposed to ad hoc individual grants)?  No, programmatic\n3 deferred action has been in use since at least 1997, and other forms of programmatic\n4 discretionary relief date back to at least 1956.  Is it granting work authorizations coextensive\n5 with the two-year period of deferred action?  No, aliens receiving deferred action have been able\n6 to apply for work authorization for decades.  Is it granting relief from accruing “unlawful\n7 presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on reentry?  No, such relief dates back to the George\n8 W. Bush Administration for those receiving deferred action.  Is it allowing recipients to apply for\n9 and obtain advance parole?  No, once again, granting advance parole has all been in accord\n10 with pre-existing law.  Is it combining all these elements into a program?  No, if each step is\nt 11 within the authority of the agency, then how can combining them in one program be outside its\nr\nu\no a 12 authority, so long as the agency vets each applicant and exercises its discretion on a case-by-case\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 basis?\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Significantly, the government makes no effort in its briefs to challenge any of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 foregoing reasons why DACA was and remains within the authority of the agency.  Nor does the\nS N 16 government challenge any of the statutes and regulations under which deferred action recipients\nted  For the  17 obtain the foregoing benefits.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Instead, the administrative record shows that the Attorney General told the Acting\n19 Secretary that DACA was illegal.  First, the Attorney General said that DACA had been\n20 improperly adopted by the Obama Administration after “Congress’ repeated rejection of\n21 proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.”  But the proposals rejected\n22 by Congress markedly differ from DACA.  Importantly, while the proposed legislation would\n23 have offered Dreamers the ability to become lawful permanent residents, no comparable\n24 pathway was offered by DACA.  Our court of appeals recognized this distinction, noting that “the\n25 DREAM Act and the DACA program are not interchangeable policies because they provided\n26 different forms of relief.”  Brewer II, 855 F.3d at 976 n.10.  In fact, the 2012 DACA memo\n27 made explicit that DACA offered no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\n28 citizenship.  Secretary Napolitano concluded her memo by stating that DACA “confer[ed] no\n33\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 34 of 49\n1 substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.”  To claim that DACA was\n2 rejected by Congress, therefore, is unfair.15\n3 Second, another criticism of DACA was that applications received mechanical, routine\n4 approval without individualized consideration.  In her rescission memorandum, the Acting\n5 Secretary indicated that “[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] has not been\n6 able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic\n7 categorical criteria as outlined in the [original DACA] memorandum, but still had his or her\n8 application denied based solely upon discretion.”  The simple answer to this, if true, would be\n9 for the agency to instruct its adjudicators to exercise discretion, on a individualized basis, to\n10 make sure applicants do not pose a threat to national security or public safety and are otherwise\nt 11 deserving of deferred action.  \nr\nu\no a 12 It appears, moreover, that the Acting Secretary was in error when she said that USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 has been unable to identify discretionary denials of DACA applications.  She cited no evidence\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 for this fact, and none is found in the administrative record.  Possibly, the Acting Secretary relied\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 on findings made in the DAPA litigation.  There, the majority panel noted that USCIS could not\nS N 16 produce any applications that satisfied the guidelines of the original DACA memorandum but\nted  For the  17 were nonetheless refused through an exercise of discretion.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 172.  As the\ni\nn\nU\n18 dissent pointed out, however, the district court may have conflated rejections of DACA\n19 applications with denials, and as a result suggested that most denials were made for mechanical,\n20 administrative reasons.  Id. at 210 (King, J., dissenting).  A declaration submitted in that case by\n21 Donald Neufeld, then-Associate Director for Service Center Operations for USCIS, pointed to\n22 several instances of discretionary denials.  Id. at 175.  That same declaration explained that while\n23 a DACA application was rejected when it was “determined upon intake that the application [had]\n24 a fatal flaw,” an application was denied when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by-case basis,\n25 determined that the requestor either had not demonstrated that they satisfied the guidelines for\n26\n15  See, e.g., S. 1291, 107th Congress (2001); S. 1545, 108th Congress (2003); S. 2075, 109th Congress\n27\n(2005); H.R. 5131, 109th Congress (2006); H.R. 1275, 110th Congress (2007); S. 2205, 110th Congress (2007);\nH.R. 1751, 111th Congress (2009); S. 3827, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3962, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3992,\n28\n111th Congress (2010); H.R. 6497, 111th Congress (2010); S. 952, 112th Congress (2011). \n34\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 35 of 49\n1 DACA or when an adjudicator determined that deferred action should be denied even though\n2 the threshold guidelines were met.  Id. at 210–11 (dissent).  The United States District Court\n3 for the District of Columbia, in addressing nearly identical statistics, recognized the distinction. \n4 The district court noted that as of December 2014, 36,860 requests for deferred action under\n5 DACA were denied and another 42,632 applicants were rejected as not eligible, and concluded\n6 that such statistics “reflect that [] case-by-case review is in operation.”  Arpaio, 27 F. Supp. 3d\n7 at 209 n.13.  The administrative record tendered in our case completely fails to explain this\n8 apparent discrepancy.  \n9 Third, the main ground given by the Attorney General for illegality was the Fifth\n10 Circuit’s decision in the DAPA litigation.  DACA, the Attorney General said, suffered from the\nt 11 same “legal and constitutional defects” leveled against DAPA in Texas v. United States, 809\nr\nu\no a 12 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Upon consideration of the full history of that case, however, this was\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 an overstatement.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 In the DAPA litigation, the district court held that DAPA violated the APA’s notice-and-\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 comment procedures because it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the\nS N 16 status and employability of millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal\nted  For the  17 government.”  The district court found that the discretionary aspects of DAPA were “merely\ni\nn\nU\n18 pretext,” based on its finding that DACA had been implemented in such a mechanical way\n19 as to prevent the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis, and DAPA would therefore be\n20 implemented in the same manner.  Notice and opportunity for public comment, it held, should\n21 have accordingly been given.  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 671. \n22 Although the Fifth Circuit recognized that “there was conflicting evidence on the degree\n23 to which DACA allowed discretion,” because the government had failed to produce any\n24 applications that satisfied all of the criteria but were refused deferred action by an exercise of\n25 discretion, it was “not error — clear or otherwise —” for the district court to have concluded that\n26 DHS had only issued denials under mechanical formulae.  The appellate court also pointed to\n27 DACA’s Operating Procedures, which contained “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for\n28\n35\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 36 of 49\n1 granting or denying deferred action,” as supporting the conclusion that DACA did not leave the\n2 agency free to exercise discretion.  \n3 It cautioned, however, that “[f]or a number of reasons, any extrapolation from DACA\n4 must be done carefully.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 173 (emphasis added).  In particular, the appellate\n5 court recognized that DACA involved self-selecting applicants, and those who expected to be\n6 denied relief were unlikely to apply.  Id. at 174.  The court also recognized that “DACA and\n7 DAPA are not identical” and that because eligibility for DACA was restricted to a younger and\n8 less numerous population, DACA applicants were less likely to have backgrounds that would\n9 warrant a discretionary denial.  Ibid.\n10 In addition to affirming the notice-and-comment holding (over one dissent), two of the\nt 11 judges on the Fifth Circuit panel went a large step further and held that DAPA conflicted with\nr\nu\no a 12 the INA.  The majority pointed out that the INA already had a specific provision through which\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 aliens could derive lawful status from their children’s immigration status.  Id. at 180 n.167\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 1201(a), 1255).  DAPA, the majority\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 said, circumvented this statutory pathway.  \nS N 16 The Fifth Circuit also pointed out that the INA had specific provisions through which\nted  For the  17 aliens could be classified as “lawfully present,” could obtain discretionary relief from removal,\ni\nn\nU\n18 or could obtain eligibility for work authorization.  Because DAPA could make 4.3 million\n19 removable aliens eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and associated\n20 benefits, the Fifth Circuit concluded that DAPA implicated “questions of deep ‘economic and\n21 political significance’ that are central to [the INA’s] statutory scheme,” and therefore had\n22 Congress wished to assign that decision to an agency, “it surely would have done so expressly.”  \n23 The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that various provisions of the INA, such as the\n24 broad grant of authority to the agency in 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (providing that the Secretary “shall\n25 be responsible for establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities”),\n26 provided the authority to implement DAPA.  Rather, it found that such grants of authority could\n27 not reasonably be construed as assigning the agency decisions of such massive “economic and\n28 political significance.”  Such an interpretation, the majority said, would allow the agency to\n36\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 37 of 49\n1 grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States.  It\n2 concluded that “even with ‘special deference’ to the Secretary,” the INA did not permit the\n3 reclassification of 4.3 million aliens as “lawfully present,” thereby making them newly eligible\n4 for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\n5 The majority also rejected the argument that DAPA was moored in historical practice,\n6 finding that such historical practice “does not, by itself, create power,” and that in any event,\n7 previous deferred-action programs were not analogous to DAPA because most discretionary\n8 deferrals had been done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or\n9 natural disasters, or had been bridges from one legal status to another.  It found that “[n]othing\n10 like DAPA, which alters the status of more than four million aliens, has ever been contemplated\nt 11 absent direct statutory authorization.” \nr\nu\no a 12 The majority concluded that Congress had “directly addressed the precise question\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 at issue” in DAPA because the INA “prescribes how parents may derive an immigration\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 classification on the basis of their child’s status and which classes of aliens can achieve deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action and eligibility for work authorization.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186.  Because it found that\nS N 16 DAPA was foreclosed by Congress’s “careful plan,” the majority held that the program was\nted  For the  17 “manifestly contrary to the statute.”\ni\nn\nU\n18 While at least some of the majority’s reasons for holding DAPA illegal would apply to\n19 DACA, fairness requires saying that DACA and DAPA were different, as the panel opinion\n20 stated.  An important criticism against DAPA would not apply against DACA, namely the fact\n21 that Congress had already established a pathway to lawful presence for alien parents of citizens\n22 (so that DAPA simply constituted a more lenient substitute route).  DACA, by contrast, has no\n23 such analogue in the INA.  And, there is a difference between 4.3 million and 689,800.  Finally,\n24 the criticism that DACA had been mechanically administered without the exercise of discretion\n25 in individual cases, if true, could be fixed by simply insisting on exercise of discretion.  In sum,\n26 the DAPA litigation was not a death knell for DACA. \n27 This order holds that, in light of our own court of appeals’ reasoning in Brewer I and\n28 Brewer II, in light of the analysis of the Office of Legal Counsel of the United States Department\n37\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 38 of 49\n1 of Justice, and the reasoning set forth above, our court of appeals will likely hold that DACA\n2 was and remains a lawful exercise of authority by DHS.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed\n3 on the merits of their claim that the rescission was based on a flawed legal premise and must be\n4 set aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\n5 law.”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528; Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94\n6 (1943); Safe Air for Everyone, 488 F.3d at 1101.16  \n7 (2) Government Counsel’s Alternative Rationale \nIs Post Hoc and, in Any Event, Arbitrary, \n8 Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n9 Government counsel now advances an alternative rationale for the Secretary’s decision to\n10 rescind DACA.  Counsel contends that DHS acted within its discretion in managing its litigation\nt 11 exposure in the Fifth Circuit, weighing its options, and deciding on an orderly wind down of the\nr\nu\no a 12 program so as to avoid a potentially disastrous injunction in the Fifth Circuit.  This, they say,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 constituted a reasonable judgment call involving management of litigation risk and agency\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 resources.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Courts, of course, may not accept post hoc rationalizations for agency action, see\nS N 16 Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962), nor may they “supply a\nted  For the  17 reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Bowman Transp.,\ni\nn\nU\n18 Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., 419 U.S. 281, 285–86 (1974); see also Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n v.\n19 Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, No. 16-70481 at 15 (9th Cir. Jan. 8, 2018).  Rather, “an\n20 agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”  Motor\n21 Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50\n22 (1983).  \n23\n24\n16  Defendants argue that if the Acting Secretary had relied on DACA’s purported illegality in\n25\nterminating the program, that reliance should be presumed to be a “reasonable policy judgment that immigration\ndecisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.”  This argument finds no support in the administrative\n26\nrecord.  In Syracuse Peace Council v. F.C.C., upon which defendants rely, the agency explicitly based its\ndecision on the independent grounds that a policy was both unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest. \n27\n867 F.2d 654, 656 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Although the court of appeals elected to review only the agency’s policy\ndetermination under the APA, it noted that “if the Commission had written its opinion in purely constitutional\n28\nterms, we would have no choice but to address the constitutional issue.”  Id. at 659.\n38\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 39 of 49\n1 The reason actually given in the administrative record for the rescission was DACA’s\n2 purported illegality.  The Attorney General’s letter and the Acting Secretary’s memorandum can\n3 only be reasonably read as stating DACA was illegal and that, given that DACA must, therefore,\n4 be ended, the best course was “an orderly and efficient wind-down process,” rather than a\n5 potentially harsh shutdown in the Fifth Circuit.  Nowhere in the administrative record did\n6 the Attorney General or the agency consider whether defending the program in court would\n7 (or would not) be worth the litigation risk.  The new spin by government counsel is a classic\n8 post hoc rationalization.  That alone is dispositive of the new “litigation risk” rationale.\n9 Significantly, the INA itself makes clear that once the Attorney General had determined\n10 that DACA was illegal, the Acting Secretary had to accept his ruling as “controlling.”  Section\nt 11 1103(a)(1) of Title 8, a provision that allocates immigration power and duties among the\nr\nu\no a 12 Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, provides that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 “determinations and rulings by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 controlling.”  Therefore, once the Attorney General advised the Acting Secretary that DACA\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 was illegal, that ruling became “controlling” upon her.  She had no choice other than to end\nS N 16 DACA.  She had no room to push back with arguments for the program, to weigh litigation risks,\nted  For the  17 or to consider whether DACA recipients warranted fighting for.  The ruling of law by the\ni\nn\nU\n18 Attorney General, controlling upon her, made all such considerations moot.  Therefore, the new\n19 spin by government counsel that the decisionmaker here indulged in a litigation risk assessment\n20 and, out of caution, chose not to fight for the program in favor of an orderly wind-down is\n21 foreclosed by the INA itself.  Her wind-down references plainly presuppose that DACA had to\n22 end and the only question was how.  \n23 Nevertheless, this order now indulges government counsel’s new explanation and\n24 addresses whether it holds up even if taken as authentic.  In that event, two major criticisms can\n25 and should be made of the “litigation risk management” rationale.  \n26 First, even as to the risk in the Fifth Circuit, the administrative record mentions only\n27 similarities between DAPA and DACA (and even then only in an exceedingly conclusory way). \n28 No mention appears concerning the differences between DAPA and DACA that might have led\n39\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 40 of 49\n1 to a different result.  In addition to the distinctions made above, one powerful consideration\n2 should have been the doctrine of laches.  Unlike the DAPA challenge filed immediately after\n3 DAPA was announced, the threatened DACA challenge by ten states would have come five\n4 years after the program began and after hundreds of thousands of young adults had enrolled and\n5 entered the workforce.  See Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967) (adopting\n6 laches in APA context); see also Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 (D.D.C. 2014),\n7 aff’d, 797 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that even if plaintiff did have standing he could not\n8 demonstrate irreparable harm since he waited two years to challenge DACA).  Another\n9 difference was that DACA was precisely the kind of interstitial program of deferred action\n10 seemingly approved even by the Fifth Circuit, Texas, 809 F.3d at 185, given that both sides of\nt 11 the aisle and our two most recent presidents have called for Dreamer legislation.  Nor was there\nr\nu\no a 12 any mention of our own circuit’s more recent decision in Brewer II that favored DACA, or of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 recognition by the district court in the District of Columbia that DACA had, contrary to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Fifth Circuit, involved discretionary denials of DACA relief.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Second, if we are to indulge the spin that the decision to end DACA rested on a\nS N 16 litigation-management assessment (rather than on a ruling of illegality), then the Acting\nted  For the  17 Secretary committed a serious error.  Against the litigation risk the Acting Secretary should\ni\nn\nU\n18 have — but did not — weigh DACA’s programmatic objectives as well as the reliance interests\n19 of DACA recipients.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126–27\n20 (2016).  This responsibility lay with the Acting Secretary, not the Attorney General.  That is,\n21 once the Acting Secretary was informed of the supposed litigation risk, it remained her\n22 responsibility to balance it against competing policy considerations.  It remained her\n23 responsibility to recognize the litigation risk, yet still ask whether the program was worth\n24 fighting for.  The administrative record is utterly silent in this regard.  \n25 The agency reversed over five years of DHS policy, did so only one day after the\n26 Attorney General’s letter, and did so just three months after Secretary Kelly had continued the\n27 program (despite the Fifth Circuit’s decision and affirmance).  The Acting Secretary failed to\n28 provide a “reasoned explanation” as to why she was “disregarding facts and circumstances\n40\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 41 of 49\n1 which underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations,\n2 Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009).  \n3 Encino Motorcars seems very close on point.  There, the Supreme Court addressed the\n4 Department of Labor’s reversal of an interpretive regulation construing the Fair Labor Standard\n5 Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions for car dealership employees.  Our court of\n6 appeals gave Chevron deference to the new interpretation.  The Supreme Court reversed. \n7 In determining whether the regulation was “procedurally defective” — and accordingly whether\n8 the agency’s regulation warranted Chevron deference — the Supreme Court evaluated whether\n9 the agency had given adequate reasons for its decision to reverse course.  Encino Motorcars,\n10 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., 463 U.S. at 43).  The Supreme Court\nt 11 explained (at page 2126) that while agencies are free to change their existing policies, they must\nr\nu\no a 12 provide a reasoned explanation for a change (quotes and citations omitted):\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In explaining its changed position, an agency must also be\ni C\ntr of  cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious\n Dis District  14 rite liisa nnocet  tihnatet rfeusrttsh ethr ajtu smtiufsict abteio tna kise nd einmtoan adcecdo ubnyt .t h Ien m suecreh  fcaacstes\ntates orthern  15 odfis preogliacryd icnhga nfagcet;s  bauntd t hcairtc au mresatsaonnceeds  ethxaptl aunnadteiorlna yis o nre wedeered for\nS N 16 engendered by the prior policy.

As there,\n23\nthe administrative record here includes no analysis of the “significant reliance issues involved.” \n24\nThe parallel is striking.  In terminating DACA, the administrative record failed to address the\n25\n689,800 young people who had come to rely on DACA to live and to work in this country. \n26\nThese individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government,\n27\npaid hefty fees, and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA.  The administrative\n28\n41\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 42 of 49\n1 record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA\n2 recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.17\n3 Ironically, government counsel now cite material outside of the administrative record in\n4 an attempt to show the Acting Secretary considered the plight of DACA recipients (Dkt. 204 at\n5 10, 12, 19–20).  This press release came after the fact and was not part of the administrative\n6 record, and therefore cannot now rescue the agency.  In that respect, Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n,\n7 No. 16-70481 at 17 n.4 is analogous.  There, our court appeals refused to consider an agency’s\n8 position which was not advanced in connection with the decision under review but, rather, was\n9 offered for the first time afterwards.  \n10 Defendants next argue that because no statute here dictated the factors for an agency to\nt 11 consider in granting or rescinding deferred action, the agency need not have given weight to the\nr\nu\no a 12 benefits of the DACA program or the harm that would be caused to its recipients upon its\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 rescission.  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that “[c]onsideration of cost reflects\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 advantages and the disadvantages of agency decision.”  Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct.\nS N 16 2699, 2707 (2015).  While defendants attempt to distinguish Michigan on the ground that the\nted  For the  17 text of the statute required regulation there to be “appropriate and necessary,” they ignore that a\ni\nn\nU\n18 change in agency policy requires the agency to have “good reasons for it.”  Fox TV Stations,\n19 Inc., 556 U.S. at 515.  \n20 Defendants, of course, are correct that when an agency reverses policy it “need not\n21 demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n22 reasons for the old one.”  Ibid.  Where, however, an agency abruptly changes course and\n23 terminates a program on which so many people rely, the APA requires “a more detailed\n24 justification.”  Ibid.  Indeed, “[i]t would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.” \n25 Ibid.  In such cases, “it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy\n26 change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that\n27\n17  Here, perhaps in light of Encino Motors, the government does not argue that Chevron deference\n28\nshould be afforded to the Attorney General’s legal conclusion that DACA exceeded the agency’s authority. \n42\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 43 of 49\n1 underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. at 515–16.  Defendants’ attempt to portray\n2 DACA as a program that did not generate reliance interests is unconvincing.  As plaintiffs’\n3 evidence shows, DACA recipients, their employers, their colleges, and their communities all\n4 developed expectations based on the possibility that DACA recipients could renew their deferred\n5 action and work authorizations for additional two-year periods.  \n6 In sum, government counsel’s alternative spin on the administrative record is just a post\n7 hoc rationalization.  But, even if it had been the actual rationale, it was arbitrary, capricious, and\n8 an abuse of discretion under Encino Motors.  \n9 *                         *                         *\n10 Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nt 11 claim that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \nr\nu\no a 12 B. Irreparable Harm.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated that they are likely to suffer serious irreparable harm\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 absent an injunction.  Before DACA, Individual Plaintiffs, brought to America as children, faced\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 a tough set of life and career choices turning on the comparative probabilities of being deported\nS N 16 versus remaining here.  DACA gave them a more tolerable set of choices, including joining the\nted  For the  17 mainstream workforce.  Now, absent an injunction, they will slide back to the pre-DACA era and\ni\nn\nU\n18 associated hardship.\n19 The University of California and other entity plaintiffs have also demonstrated that they\n20 face irreparable harm as they begin to lose valuable students and employees in whom they have\n21 invested, and that loss of DACA recipients from the workforce will have a detrimental impact on\n22 their organization interests, economic output, public health, and safety.  \n23 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “prolonged separation from family\n24 members” and “constraints to recruiting and retaining faculty members to foster diversity and\n25 quality within the University community” are harms which are not compensable with monetary\n26 damages and therefore weigh in favor of finding irreparable harm.  Hawaii v. Trump,\n27 No. 17-17168, 2017 WL 6554184, at *22 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017).  These showings accordingly\n28\n43\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 44 of 49\n1 demonstrate that preliminary relief is appropriate.  Ibid.; see also Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting,\n2 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).\n3 Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs are likely to suffer such harms.  Rather, they\n4 argue that these harms will not happen before the phase-out begins on March 5, 2018, the date\n5 by which the undersigned judge had wanted to present a final record and final decision for\n6 appellate review.  \n7 Delays in this case, however, have made it impossible to send a final judgment to our\n8 court of appeals by March 5.  To take only one example, it would be unfair to reach a conclusion\n9 without giving plaintiffs an opportunity to examine the complete administrative record. \n10 Government counsel, however, succeeded in obtaining an order from the Supreme Court\nt 11 postponing proceedings on completing the administrative record until after ruling on its\nr\nu\no a 12 FRCP 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  As a result, we have yet to receive a complete administrative\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 record.  Although plaintiffs are likely to prevail on even the truncated administrative record, as\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 set forth above, our appellate court might disagree with that conclusion or the agency might seek\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 to cure the flaws in its process via a fresh agency action.  Plaintiffs are entitled to learn of all\nS N 16 flaws, if any more there be, lurking in the whole record.  One such possibility suggested by\nted  For the  17 plaintiffs is that the rescission was contrived to give the administration a bargaining chip to\ni\nn\nU\n18 demand funding for a border wall in exchange for reviving DACA.  A presidential tweet after\n19 our hearing gives credence to this claim.  Another possibility raised by plaintiffs is racial animus. \n20 These theories deserve the benefit of the full administrative record.  It will be impossible to\n21 litigate this case to a fair and final conclusion before March 5.18 \n22\n23\n24\n25\n18  On December 29, 2017, President Trump tweeted:  “The Democrats have been told, and fully\n26\nunderstand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an\nEND to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.  We must protect our\n27\nCountry at all cost!” (Dkt. No. 227-2).  Plaintiffs separately request judicial notice of this tweet.  Defendants\nobject to judicial notice on various relevancy grounds, but do not argue that it is not properly subject to judicial\n28\nnotice under FRE 201 (Dkt. Nos. 227, 230).  Plaintiffs’ request is accordingly GRANTED.  \n44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 45 of 49\n1 C. Balance of Equities and Public Interest.\n2 On provisional relief motions, district judges must consider whether (or not) such relief\n3 would be in the public interest.  On this point, we seem to be in the unusual position wherein the\n4 ultimate authority over the agency, the Chief Executive, publicly favors the very program the\n5 agency has ended.  In September, President Trump stated his support for DACA, tweeting: \n6 “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who\n7 have jobs, some serving in the military?  Really! . . . .”  He has also called upon Congress to\n8 ratify DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n9 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” (App. 1958). \n10 For the reasons DACA was instituted, and for the reasons tweeted by President Trump,\nt 11 this order finds that the public interest will be served by DACA’s continuation (on the conditions\nr\nu\no a 12 and exceptions set out below).  Beginning March 5, absent an injunction, one thousand\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 individuals per day, on average, will lose their DACA protection.  The rescission will result in\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 hundreds of thousands of individuals losing their work authorizations and deferred action status. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 This would tear authorized workers from our nation’s economy and would prejudice their being\nS N 16 able to support themselves and their families, not to mention paying taxes to support our nation. \nted  For the  17 Too, authorized workers will lose the benefit of their employer-provided healthcare plans and\ni\nn\nU\n18 thus place a greater burden on emergency healthcare services.  \n19 On provisional relief motions, district judges must also weigh the balance of hardships\n20 flowing from a grant versus denial of provisional relief.  The hardship to plaintiffs need not be\n21 repeated.  The only hardship raised by defendants is interference with the agency’s judgment on\n22 how best to allocate its resources in keeping our homeland secure, as well as its judgment in\n23 phasing out DACA.  Significantly, however, the agency’s judgment here was not based on a\n24 policy change.  It was based on a mistake of law.  If the instant order is correct that DACA fell\n25 within the statutory and constitutional powers of the Executive Branch, then a policy supported\n26\n27\n28\n45\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 46 of 49\n1 as high up as our Chief Executive has been the victim of a colossal blunder.  A preliminary\n2 injunction will set that right without imposing any policy unwanted by the Executive Branch.19\n3 D. Scope of Provisional Relief. \n4 For the foregoing reasons, defendants ARE HEREBY ORDERED AND ENJOINED, pending\n5 final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis on\n6 the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on September 5, 2017,\n7 including allowing DACA enrollees to renew their enrollments, with the exceptions (1) that new\n8 applications from applicants who have never before received deferred action need not be\n9 processed; (2) that the advance parole feature need not be continued for the time being for\n10 anyone; and (3) that defendants may take administrative steps to make sure fair discretion is\nt 11 exercised on an individualized basis for each renewal application.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Nothing in this order prohibits the agency from proceeding to remove any individual,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 including any DACA enrollee, who it determines poses a risk to national security or public\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 safety, or otherwise deserves, in its judgment, to be removed.  Nor does this order bar the agency\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 from granting advance parole in individual cases it finds deserving, or from granting deferred\nS N 16 action to new individuals on an ad hoc basis.  \nted  For the  17 The agency shall post reasonable public notice that it will resume receiving DACA\ni\nn\nU\n18 renewal applications and prescribe a process consistent with this order.  The agency shall keep\n19 records of its actions on all DACA-related applications and provide summary reports to the\n20 Court (and counsel) on the first business day of each quarter.20  \n21\n22\n19  If a likelihood of irreparable injury is shown and an injunction is in the public interest, a preliminary\ninjunction is also appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits are raised\n23\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n632 F.3d 1127, 1134–35 (9th Cir. 2011).  Because plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of\n24\nirreparable injury and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffs’ favor, preliminary relief would also\nbe appropriate under this alternative standard of review.  \n25\n20  A mandatory injunction orders a responsible party to take action, while “[a] prohibitory injunction\n26\nprohibits a party from taking action and preserves the status quo pending a determination of the action on the\nmerits.”  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1060.  The relevant status quo is the legally relevant relationship between the\n27\nparties before the controversy arose.  Id. at 1061.  Here, plaintiffs contest the validity of defendants’ rescission\nof DACA, the status quo before which was that DACA was fully implemented.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’\n28\nrequested preliminary injunction is not mandatory.  But even if it were, plaintiffs have demonstrated that\nsufficiently serious irreparable harm would result to warrant even a mandatory injunction.  \n46\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 47 of 49\n1 By way of explanation, while plaintiffs have demonstrated that DACA recipients,\n2 as well as their families, schools, employers, and communities, are likely to suffer substantial,\n3 irreparable harm as a result of the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to\n4 individuals who have never applied for or obtained DACA.  \n5 This order will not require advance parole.  Unlike the widespread harm to plaintiffs and\n6 our economy that would result were the 689,800 DACA enrollees to lose their ability to work in\n7 this country, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that comparable harm will occur as a result of\n8 DACA recipients’ inability to travel abroad.  True, Individual Plaintiffs Jirayut Latthivongskorn\n9 and Norma Ramirez describe professional disadvantages that may result if they are unable to\n10 travel internationally.  These, however, do not amount to hardships justifying a provisional\nt 11 injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole.  However, as\nr\nu\no a 12 stated, nothing in this order would bar individuals from asking for such agency relief or bar the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 agency from granting it in deserving cases.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 With respect to geographical scope, this order finds a nationwide injunction is\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 appropriate.  Our country has a strong interest in the uniform application of immigration law\nS N 16 and policy.  Plaintiffs have established injury that reaches beyond the geographical bounds\nted  For the  17 of the Northern District of California.  The problem affects every state and territory of the\ni\nn\nU\n18 United States. \n19 In February 2017, our court of appeals considered this very issue in Washington v.\n20 Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017), and upheld a nationwide injunction imposed by a\n21 single district court, observing that limiting the geographic scope of an injunction on an\n22 immigration enforcement policy “would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory\n23 requirements for uniform immigration law and policy” and that, as here, “the government ha[d]\n24 not proposed a workable alternative.”  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion in\n25 determining the appropriate scope of an injunction over DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88,\n26\n27\n28\n47\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 48 of 49\n1 holding that uniform application of the immigration laws justified a nationwide injunction.  So\n2 too here.21\n3 Limiting relief to the States in suit or the Individual Plaintiffs would result in\n4 administrative confusion and simply provoke many thousands of individual lawsuits all over the\n5 country.  The most practical relief is to maintain DACA in the same manner to which the agency\n6 and recipients are accustomed, subject to the exceptions above noted.  \n7 CONCLUSION\n8 Defendants’ motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1) is GRANTED IN PART only to the\n9 limited extent stated above and is otherwise DENIED.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are\n10 hereby DISMISSED.  Maine or Minnesota may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR\nt 11 DAYS from the date of this order to file a motion, noticed on the normal 35-day track, for leave to\nr\nu\no a 12 file an amended complaint.  A proposed amended complaint must be appended to the motion and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 amendments to the complaint cure the deficiencies identified herein.  To the extent stated above,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief is GRANTED.  A separate order will address defendants’\nS N 16 motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6).\nted  For the  17 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\ni\nn\nU\n18 Pursuant to our court of appeals’ order dated December 21, 2017, the district court\n19 hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues decided herein (i) whether (or not) the\n20 rescission of DACA is unreviewable as committed to agency discretion or by reason of 8 U.S.C.\n21 § 1252(g), (ii) whether (or not) plaintiffs have standing, and (iii) all other questions interposed\n22 by the government in its motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1).  This order finds that these are\n23 controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and\n24\n25\n21  Oddly, the government’s contrary authority is Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169–70 (9th Cir.\n1987), a decision in which our court of appeals upheld a nationwide injunction and held, “[t]here is no general\n26\nrequirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit,” and “nationwide relief in federal district or\ncircuit court [is permitted] when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal merely observed that “[w]here relief can be\n27\nstructured on an individual basis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.”  Id. at 1170. \nHere, it cannot be so structured.  Nor are any of the government’s other authorities, which restate the general\n28\nproposition that a remedy should match the injury alleged, see, e.g., Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,\n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017), to the contrary. \n48\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05380-WHA   Document 60   Filed 01/09/18   Page 49 of 49\n1 that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the litigation.  This order\n2 realizes that the same issues are reviewable upon appeal of this injunction.  Nevertheless, out of\n3 caution and to avoid any problem concerning scope of review, the district court so certifies.  \n4\n5 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n6\n7 Dated:  January 9, 2018.                                                             \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n8 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n9\n10\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n49",
