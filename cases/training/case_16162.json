    "summary": "<p>In 2012, the Obama administration created the DACA program through policy statements by the Department of Homeland Security. The program offered work permits—and temporary protection from deportation—to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he would end the program in March 2018 unless Congress acted to provide statutory authorization for the program and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memorandum on September 5, 2017 ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). This lawsuit, filed on September 18, 2017 in the US. District Court for the District of Columbia, was one of many cases challenging President Trump's revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood (DACA) program. </p><p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (\"NAACP\") initially filed this complaint, and later amended to add the American Federation of Teachers and United Food Commerical Workers International Union as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, represented by the law firm Cohen Milstein, argued that the termination of DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantees. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court held that DACA's recession was arbitrary and capricious and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to process new and renewal DACA applications. The defendants ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court, and on June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court in this case. <hr></p><p>In the complaint, the plaintiff stated that the Trump Administration, by ending DACA, had \"unlawfully [reneged] on [its] promise to protect young, undocumented immigrants of color living in the United States.\" The plaintiff also noted that 95% of DACA recipients were people of color, including people of African, Latin American, Asian, and Middle Eastern descent. Some DACA recipients were also NAACP members. Thus, the NAACP brought the suit in its organizational capacity on behalf of its DACA-recipient members.</p><p>The complaint asserted that DACA allowed children brought to the United States who met specific criteria to request deferred action for two years, subject to renewal. In addition to protecting grantees from being arrested solely due to their immigration status, DACA allowed its grantees to receive public benefits like social security, to enroll in higher education institutions, and to increase income and assets. All throughout the implementation process, the federal government enforcing DACA clearly represented that it would not use the information obtained in the application process to enforce immigration policy. Furthermore, the government promised that recipients would only lose their lawful presence for reasons of fraud, criminal conduct, national security, or public safety.</p><p>The plaintiff argued that these recipients would now lose their protections and be at risk for deportation, especially since the grantees provided the federal government with sensitive information in their applications, and \"termination of the DACA Program is accompanied by withdrawal of the guarantee that information provided by DACA applicants and registrants will not be used in deportation proceedings.\"</p><p>The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had violated Fifth Amendment due process by rescinding DACA, and would do so again by using sensitive information in deportation proceedings. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by carrying out government action without a \"legitimate and reasoned basis.\" Specifically, the automatic DACA termination, with no notice or opportunity to respond, ran contrary to USCIS's DACA Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Finally, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated the Regulatory Flexibility Act, by carrying out regulatory action that would harm small organizations such as the plaintiff.</p><p>The plaintiff sought declaratory relief, as well as injunctive relief preventing defendants from withdrawing DACA and from using DACA recipients' application information in actions against them, their families, or their employers. </p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper on Sept. 19, 2017.</p><p>On Oct. 24, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The complaint added as plaintiffs the American Federation of Teachers and the United Food and Commercial Workers' International Union. All organizational plaintiffs had DACA-registrant members.</p><p>On Nov. 8, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and a motion for summary judgment. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing (as they were not injured as organizations nor did they identify injured members); that the defendants' recession of DACA was a non-justiciable exercise of enforcement discretion; that a rational explanation supported the defendants' decision under the APA; and that the plaintiffs lacked a protected due process interest in DACA. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment.</p><p>On Dec. 15, the plaintiffs moved to submit declarations from nine pseudonymous DACA-recipient members of the organizational plaintiffs. On Jan. 3, 2018, the case was re-assigned to Judge John D. Bates. On Jan. 18, this case was consolidated with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16247\"><i>Trustees of Princeton University v. U.S.A.</i></a>, with <i>NAACP v. Trump</i> designated as the lead case. </p><p>On April 24, 2018, Judge John D. Bates held that the district court had both jurisdiction and statutory authority to hear the plaintiffs' APA and constitutional claims. 298 F. Supp. 3d 209. The court concluded that under the APA, DHS’ September 5, 2017 decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary and capricious, for DHS failed to adequately explain why the program was unlawful: “Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program.” The Court thereby granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to the substantive APA claim, but denied their motion as to the procedural APA claim, and denied their motion for preliminary injunctive relief on their information-sharing claim. The decision to rescind DACA was vacated and remanded to DHS, which meant that DHS must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications. However, the Court stayed its vacatur order for 90 days to allow the agency an opportunity to better explain its rescission decision. </p><p>On August 3, 2018, the Court denied the government’s motion to revise the April 2018 order. 315 F. Supp. 3d 457. The Court held that while the government had provided additional policy grounds concerning the decision to rescind DACA, “most of these simply repackage legal arguments previously made, and hence are ‘insufficiently independent from the agency’s evaluation of DACA’s legality’ to preclude judicial review or to support the agency’s decision.” The Court noted that it had already once given DHS the opportunity to provide explanations, so it would not do so again, though it did stay the order of vacatur for 20 days. In relation to the relief granted by the Court, it specifically noted that DHS does not lack the statutory or constitutional authority to rescind DACA, but rather, that DHS must give a rational explanation for its decision to rescind DACA.  Several days later, the government appealed to the DC Circuit Court. </p><p>On August 14, 2018, the government filed a motion for the district court to stay its April 24 decision, pending the appeal in the D.C. Circuit, and a motion to clarify that the August 3 order was a final, appealable judgment and that the plaintiffs’ remaining constitutional claims were moot. Three days later, the district court granted a limited stay of its April 24 order as it applies to initial DACA applications and applications for DACA-based advance parole so as to preserve the status quo pending the appeal (as suggested by the plaintiffs). 321 F. Supp. 3d 143. It also granted the motion to clarify.</p><p>In November 2018, while the appeal was pending, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions for certiorari before judgment, in this case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462”><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>, also challenging the DACA rescission. In <i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i> and <i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i>, the district courts had granted a nationwide injunction to maintain the DACA program. All three cases were appealed to the Circuit Courts as well. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard oral argument on the appeal from <i>NAACP</i> on February 22, 2019.</p><p> </p><p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court granted the petitions and consolidated <i>NAACP v. Trump</i>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>. 139 S. Ct. 2779. The three consolidated cases were heard under the caption of <i>Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California</i>. 139 S.Ct. 2779. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy was judicially reviewable and whether DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was lawful. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants did not follow proper APA procedures.</p><p>On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in all three cases, affirming the judgment of the district court in this case. 140 S. Ct. 1891. It held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program. </p><p>As a result, on July 23, 2020, the D.C. Circuit remanded the case to the district court, with instructions to remand to the Department of Homeland Security for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court. The district court remanded the same day. </p><p>The Department of Homeland Security then issued a memorandum entitled \"Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled 'Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" on July 28, 2020. In this memo, Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf stated that he would reconsider DACA's future in light of the Supreme Court's decision. In the interim, the memo instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. </p><p>In a joint status report on September 16, 2020, the plaintiffs indicated that they did not intend to challenge the July 28th Wolf Memorandum, but reserved the right to do so in the future or to challenge any future agency actions with respect to DACA. They asked the court to continue holding the cases in abeyance.</p><p>Though the plaintiffs in this case declined to challenge the July 28th Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16130\"><i>State of New York v. Trump</i></a> challenged the memo, arguing that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully appointed to his position and did not have authority to issue the memo and that the memo was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The court in <i>Batalla Vidal</i> and <i>State of New York</i> found that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary and did not have authority to issue the memo. On December 4, 2020, the court in <i>Batalla Vidal</i> and <i>State of New York</i> ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017. The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years. On December 7, 2020 <a href = \"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca\">USCIS</a> updated their website and indicated that effective that day, USCIS would accept initial applications, extend one-year DACA renewals to two-years, and accept applications for advance parole.</p><p>In January 2021, President Biden took office and immediately shifted the executive's approach to DACA. On the day of his inauguration (January 20, 2021), President Biden signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General “to preserve and fortify DACA.\" As of May 14, 2021, this case is ongoing.</p>",

Also before the Court is [81] the government’s unopposed motion for clarification \nthat the August 3, 2018 order was a final, appealable judgment.    \nThe government seeks a stay of the Court’s orders in their entirety or, in the alternative, at \nleast insofar as they require the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to begin accepting \napplications for initial grants of DACA benefits and for advance parole under the DACA program.  \nSee Defs.’ Mot. for a Stay Pending Appeal (“Gov’t’s Mot.”) [ECF No. 82] at 1–2.  Plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 2 of 9\noppose the government’s motion in part, urging the Court not to stay its orders in their entirety, \nbut agreeing that a stay as to initial DACA applications would be proper.  See Pls.’ Partial Opp’n \nto Defs.’ Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal (“Pls.’ Opp’n”) [ECF No. 83] at 1 (recognizing that “an \nimperfect ‘status quo’—no new applicants, but renewals continue—has developed”).  For the \nreasons that follow, the government’s motion to clarify will be granted, and its motion for a stay \npending appeal will be granted in part.  The Court will stay its order as to new DACA applications \nand applications for advance parole, but not as to renewal applications. \nThe Court is mindful that continuing the stay in this case will temporarily deprive certain \nDACA-eligible individuals, and plaintiffs in these cases, of relief to which the Court has concluded \nthey are legally entitled.  But the Court is also aware of the significant confusion and uncertainty \nthat currently surrounds the status of the DACA program, which is now the subject of litigation in \nmultiple federal district courts and courts of appeals.  Because that confusion would only be \nmagnified if the Court’s order regarding initial DACA applications were to take effect now and \nlater be reversed on appeal, the Court will grant a limited stay of its order and preserve the status \nquo pending appeal, as plaintiffs themselves suggest.  \nI.   MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL   \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), district courts generally have the authority to \nstay their orders pending appeal.  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).  In determining \nwhether to grant such a stay, courts consider four factors: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made \na strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 3 of 9\nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Id.; see also Wash. \nMetro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 842–43 (D.C. Cir. 1977).   \nTraditionally, courts in this Circuit have considered these factors on a “‘sliding scale,’ \nwhereby ‘a strong showing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.’”  Cigar \nAss’n of Am. v. FDA, Civil Action No. 16-1460, 2018 WL 3304627, at *3 (D.D.C. July 5, 2018) \n(quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  Although recent decisions of \nthe Supreme Court have called this approach into question,1 “the district judges in this Circuit \ncontinue to adhere to binding precedent and apply the sliding scale approach to determine whether \na movant is entitled to an injunction pending resolution of its appeal,” id. (collecting cases), and \nplaintiffs do not dispute the propriety of that approach here, see Pls.’ Opp’n at 2 n.1.  Thus, if “the \nthree other factors strongly favor issuing” a stay, then the government “need only raise a ‘serious \nlegal question’ on the merits” for that stay to issue.  Cigar Ass’n of Am., 2018 WL 3304627, at *3 \n(quoting Aamer, 742 F.3d at 1043); see also Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 843 (“[A] court, when \nconfronted with a case in which the other three factors strongly favor interim relief[,] may exercise \nits discretion to grant a stay if the movant has made a substantial case on the merits.”).  \nAs to the first factor, the Court finds that the government’s appeal raises “serious legal \nquestion[s].”  Aamer, 742 F.3d at 1043.  Those questions include whether DHS’s decision to \nrescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \nsee 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) (exempting from APA review “agency action [that] is committed to \nagency discretion by law”), and, if so, whether that decision was arbitrary and capricious, see 5 \n                                                 \n1 See id. (noting that, following the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), a case that dealt with preliminary injunctive relief, “it remains an open question whether \nthe ‘likelihood of success’ factor is an ‘independent, free-standing requirement’” (quoting Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d \n1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014)). \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 4 of 9\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Of course, this Court has already answered both questions in the affirmative: \nas the Court has explained at length elsewhere, DACA’s rescission was both reviewable and \nunlawful because it was based chiefly on a “virtually unexplained” conclusion that DACA was \nunlawful.  NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 249 (D.D.C. 2018).  Nevertheless, the \ngovernment has assembled a “substantial case on the merits,” Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 843, and \nthe fact that the Court has thus far been unpersuaded by that case does not preclude the issuance \nof a stay, see id. (“The court . . . may grant a stay even though its own approach may be contrary \nto [the] movant’s view of the merits.”); see also Jewish War Veterans of the U.S., Inc. v. Gates, \n522 F. Supp. 2d 73, 79 (D.D.C. 2007) (granting a stay pending appeal where the nonmovant argued \nthat a D.C. Circuit decision was “directly on point and controls the outcome of this case”).2   \nThe remaining factors lend sufficient support to plaintiffs’ proposal for a limited stay \npending appeal (i.e., as to initial DACA applications and applications for advance parole only) to \nrender that stay appropriate in light of the government’s “substantial” legal case.  See Cigar Ass’n \nof Am., 2018 WL 3304627, at *4.  But they do not support the government’s request for a stay of \nthe Court’s order in its entirety. \n                                                 \n2 Many of the defects in the government’s merits case are apparent even in its motion for a stay pending \nappeal.  For example, the government reiterates its illogical reading of Crowley Caribbean Transport, Inc. v. Peña, 37 \nF.3d 671 (D.C. Cir. 1994), whereby a court could reject “an enforcement decision’s supporting rationale” and yet be \npowerless to remedy the unlawful “enforcement decision itself,” Gov’t’s Mot. at 6.  Similarly, the government relies \non United Automobile Workers v. Brock, a decision that expressly acknowledged that “review might be available \neven for a nonenforcement decision” where, as here, “that decision is predicated solely on the agency’s interpretation \nof a statute” or other law.  783 F.2d 237, 245 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (emphasis added); see id. at 245 n.9 (declining to \nreview the decision at issue in that case because there, unlike here, the agency’s “decision not to take enforcement \naction . . . was predicated on a combination of both statutory and discretionary grounds”).  The government also \ncontinues to advance the flawed premise that Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), supports DACA’s \nrescission, this time “direct[ing]” the Court to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion as though it were somehow that court’s \nresponsibility—and not DHS’s—to explain DHS’s decision to rescind the DACA program.  Gov’t’s Mot. at 7.  \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 5 of 9\nThe second factor—the risk of irreparable injury to DHS—favors a stay, but only as to \ninitial DACA applications and applications for DACA-based advance parole.  The Court is \nunmoved  by  the  government’s  assertion  of  injury  resulting  from  its  being  “enjoined  from \nimplementing an act of Congress.”  Gov’t’s Mot. at 8.  As the Court has already explained, DHS \nhas been implementing that act of Congress (the Immigration and Nationality Act) under an ill-\nconsidered  (and  hence  possibly  incorrect)  understanding  of  its  enforcement  authority.    See \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 249.  Unlike an injunction prohibiting the exercise of statutory \nauthority altogether, see New Motor Veh. Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 \n(1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (concluding “that any time a State is enjoined by a court from \neffectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury”), this Court’s order simply corrects the improper exercise of that authority.  To the extent \nthat such an injury is cognizable at all, it is insufficient to justify staying the Court’s order here. \nThe Court accepts, however, that the additional staff and other resources required for DHS \nto process initial DACA applications would constitute a cognizable injury.  DHS estimates that \nfull implementation of the Court’s order would lead to the filing of over 100,000 initial DACA \napplications and 30,000 requests for advance parole, which would in turn require the hiring of 72 \ntemporary employees and the reassignment or hiring of 60 full-time employees.  See Gov’t’s Mot. \nat 9–10.  But these burdens apply only as to initial DACA applications, since DHS has been \naccepting renewal applications since mid-2012, with the exception of a brief period in late 2017 \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 6 of 9\nand early 2018.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 218–20.3  The second factor therefore favors \nplaintiffs’ proposed limited stay, not the government’s full stay. \nThe third factor, the risk of injury to plaintiffs, again favors continuing the stay as to initial \nDACA applications and applications for advance parole, but not as to renewal applications.  \nAlthough the government maintains that the termination of existing DACA benefits—which would \nimmediately end DACA beneficiaries’ work authorizations and could lead to their removal from \nthe United States—is not an irreparable harm, this untenable proposition has been rejected by this \nCourt and by several others.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 245 (noting in the stay-of-vacatur \ncontext that “each day that the agency delays is a day that aliens who might otherwise be eligible \nfor initial grants of DACA benefits are exposed to removal because of an unlawful agency action”); \nsee also Regents of the U. of Cal. v. DHS, 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1046–47 (N.D. Cal. 2018); \nBatalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 434–35 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).  And although there are \ncurrently two preliminary injunctions in place requiring DHS to continue accepting renewal \napplications, as the Court has previously noted, “those injunctions are both on expedited appeals \nand hence could be reversed in the not-too-distant future.”  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 245.  This \nCourt’s order—which, unlike the preliminary injunctions entered in parallel litigation, is a final \njudgment—will therefore prevent irreparable harm to plaintiffs and all current DACA beneficiaries \nshould those other injunctions be reversed.  Hence, it will not be stayed as to renewal applications.  \nBy contrast, the Court agrees with the district court in Regents that “while plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that DACA recipients . . . are likely to suffer substantial, irreparable harm as a result \n                                                 \n3 When DHS rescinded DACA in September 2017, it immediately stopped accepting new DACA applications \nbut continued to accept certain renewal applications that were filed within the next thirty days.  Id. at 218.  Then, in \nJanuary 2018, a district court in California ordered DHS to resume accepting renewal applications.  Id. at 220.  \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 7 of 9\nof the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to individuals who have never \napplied for or obtained DACA” benefits.  279 F. Supp. 3d at 1049; accord Batalla Vidal, 279 F. \nSupp. 3d at 437 (“As in Regents, . . . the court finds that the irreparable harms identified by \nPlaintiffs largely result from Defendants’ expected failure to renew existing grants of deferred \naction and especially work authorization, not from Defendants’ refusal to adjudicate new initial \nDACA applications.”).  The same is true of advance parole.  See Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1049 \n(concluding that “inability to travel abroad . . . do[es] not amount to [a] hardship[] justifying a \nprovisional injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole”); \nBatalla Vidal, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 437 (citing Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1048–49).  Thus, like the \nsecond factor, the third factor supports a stay as to initial DACA applications and applications for \nadvance parole, but not as to renewal applications.  \nThe fourth and final factor—the public interest—also favors this limited stay.  The Court \nhas already recognized the disruption that would ensue if DHS were to begin accepting initial \nDACA applications pursuant to the Court’s order but that order were later reversed on appeal.  See \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 244–45 (citing Allied–Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm’n, 988 \nF.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).  Just as this potential for disruption previously counseled in \nfavor of a 90-day stay of the Court’s order of vacatur, see id., it now suggests that the public interest \nwould be served by a stay pending appeal as to initial DACA applications.  Like the second and \nthird factors, however, this fourth factor does not support a stay as to renewal applications, since \nDHS is already accepting those applications.  \nIn sum, because the government’s appeal raises “serious legal questions,” and because the \nremaining factors—harm to DHS, harm to DACA beneficiaries, and the public interest—favor a \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 8 of 9\nstay of the Court’s order of vacatur as to initial DACA applications and applications for DACA-\nbased advance parole, the Court will grant the government’s request for a stay as to those \napplications.  But because the three equitable factors do not favor a stay as to applications for the \nrenewal of DACA benefits, pursuant to the “sliding scale” approach employed in this Circuit, \nCigar Ass’n of Am., 2018 WL 3304627, at *3, the Court will not stay its order as to renewal \napplications.  And the Court notes again that plaintiffs agree to this limited stay of the Court’s \norder pending appeal.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 15–16.  \nII.  MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION \nFinally, the government has moved for clarification that the Court’s August 3, 2018 order \nwas a final, appealable judgment.  See Defs.’ Mot. for Clarification Regarding Entry of Final \nJudgment (“Gov’t’s Mot. for Clarification”) [ECF No. 81] at 2–3.  The government also seeks an \norder dismissing plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DACA’s rescission as moot.  See id. at 3.  \nPlaintiffs oppose the dismissal of their constitutional claims but agree that the Court’s August 3, \n2018 order is final and appealable.  See id. at 3 n.2. \nInitially, the Court deferred ruling on plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DACA’s \nrescission pending DHS’s response to the April 24, 2018 order vacating DACA’s rescission on \nadministrative grounds. See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 246 (explaining that DHS “could, on \nremand, alter DACA’s rescission in ways that might affect the merits of plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims”).  Because the Court has since declined to reconsider its April 24, 2018 order, a decision \non plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DACA’s rescission is unnecessary.  See Alabama Power \nCo. v. EPA, 40 F.3d 450, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (declining to address a claim rendered moot by the \ncourt’s vacatur of the agency’s action).  Moreover, the Court has already entered final judgment \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 32   Filed 08/17/18   Page 9 of 9\non plaintiffs’ remaining administrative and constitutional claims.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d \nat 249.  Thus, the Court’s August 3, 2018 order denying reconsideration “adjudicat[ed] all the \nclaims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities” in this action and was therefore a final, appealable \norder.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).   \n*  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal will be \ngranted in part, and the Court will stay its order of vacatur as it applies to initial DACA applications \nand applications for DACA-based advance parole.  The government’s motion to clarify will also \nbe granted.  A separate order has been issued on this date.  \n                        /s/                      \nJOHN D.

Argued November 12, 2019—Decided June 18, 2020*  \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo-\nrandum announcing an immigration relief program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows certain unauthor-\nized aliens who arrived in the United States as children to apply for a \ntwo-year forbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief become \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  Some  \n700,000 aliens have availed themselves of this opportunity. \n     Two years later, DHS expanded DACA eligibility and created a re-\nlated program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).  If implemented, that program \nwould have made 4.3 million parents of U.  S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents eligible for the same forbearance from removal, work  \neligibility, and other benefits as DACA recipients.  Texas, joined by 25 \nother States, secured a nationwide preliminary injunction barring im-\nplementation of both the DACA expansion and DAPA.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit upheld the injunction, concluding that the program violated the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), which carefully defines eligi-\nbility for benefits.  This Court affirmed by an equally divided vote, and \n—————— \n*Together  with No. 18–588, Trump, President of the United States, et  \n \nal. v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et al., \non certiorari before judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for  \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and No. 18–589, Wolf, Acting Secretary \nof Homeland  Security, et al. v.  Batalla  Vidal et al., on certiorari before \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nthe litigation then continued in the District Court.   \n     In June 2017, following a change in Presidential administrations,  \nDHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum, citing, among other reasons, \nthe ongoing suit by Texas  and new policy priorities.  That September, \nthe Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nElaine C. Duke that DACA shared DAPA’s legal flaws and should also \nbe rescinded.  The next day, Duke acted on that advice.  Taking into \nconsideration the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court rulings and the At-\ntorney General’s letter, Duke decided to terminate the program.  She \nexplained that DHS would no longer accept new applications, but that \nexisting DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within six \nmonths could apply for a two-year renewal.  For all other DACA recip-\nients, previously issued grants of relief would expire on their own \nterms, with no prospect for renewal.   \n     Several groups of plaintiffs challenged Duke’s decision to rescind  \nDACA, claiming that it was arbitrary  and capricious in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and infringed the equal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  District  \nCourts in California (Regents, No. 18–587), New York (Batalla Vidal, \nNo. 18–589), and the District of Columbia (NAACP, No. 18–588) all  \nruled for the plaintiffs.  Each court rejected the Government’s argu-\nments that the claims were unreviewable under the APA and that the  \nINA deprived the courts of jurisdiction. In Regents and Batalla Vidal, \nthe District Courts further held that the equal protection claims were \nadequately alleged, and they entered coextensive nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs were likely \nto succeed on their APA claims.  The District Court in  NAACP took a \ndifferent approach.  It deferred ruling on  the equal protection chal-\nlenge but granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their \nAPA claim, finding that the rescission was inadequately explained.  \nThe court then stayed its order for 90 days to permit DHS to reissue a \nmemorandum rescinding  DACA, this time with a fuller explanation of \nthe conclusion that DACA was unlawful.  Two months later, Duke’s  \nsuccessor, Secretary Kirstjen M.  Nielsen, responded to  the court’s  or-\nder.  She declined to disturb or replace Duke’s rescission decision and \ninstead explained why she thought her predecessor’s decision was \nsound.  In addition to reiterating the illegality conclusion, she offered \nseveral new justifications for the rescission.  The Government moved  \nfor the District Court to reconsider in light of this additional explana-\ntion, but the court concluded that the new reasoning failed to elaborate \nmeaningfully on the illegality rationale.  \n     The Government appealed  the various District Court  decisions to  \nthe Second, Ninth, and D.  C. Circuits, respectively.  While those ap-\npeals were pending, the Government filed three petitions  for certiorari  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nbefore judgment.  Following  the Ninth Circuit affirmance in Regents, \nthis Court granted  certiorari.  \nHeld: The judgment in No. 18–587 is vacated in part and reversed in \npart; the judgment in No. 18–588 is affirmed; the February 13, 2018 \norder in No. 18–589 is vacated, the November 9, 2017 order is affirmed  \nin part, and the March 29, 2018 order is reversed in part; and all of the \ncases are remanded. \nNo. 18–587, 908 F. 3d 476, vacated in part and reversed in part; No. 18–\n588, affirmed; and No. 18–589, February  13, 2018 order vacated, No-\nvember 9, 2017 order affirmed in part, and March 29, 2018 order re-\nversed in part; all cases remanded. \n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to  \nPart IV, concluding: \n   1. DHS’s rescission decision  is reviewable under the APA and is \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.  Pp. 9–13. \n     (a) The APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” of agency ac-\ntion, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140, can be rebut-\nted by showing that the “agency action is committed to agency discre-\ntion by law,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  In Heckler v. Chaney, the Court held  \nthat this narrow exception includes an agency’s decision not to insti-\ntute an enforcement action.  470 U. S. 821, 831–832.  The Government  \ncontends that DACA is a general non-enforcement policy  equivalent to \nthe individual non-enforcement decision in  Chaney.  But the DACA  \nMemorandum  did not merely decline to institute enforcement proceed-\nings; it created a program for conferring  affirmative immigration re-\nlief.  Therefore,  unlike  the  non-enforcement  decision  in  Chaney, \nDACA’s creation—and its rescission—is an “action [that] provides a  \nfocus for judicial review.”   Id., at 832.  In addition, by virtue of receiving \ndeferred action, 700,000 DACA recipients may  request work  authori-\nzation and are eligible for Social Security and Medicare.  Access to such  \nbenefits is an interest “courts often are called upon to protect.”  Ibid.   \nDACA’s rescission is thus subject to review under the APA.  Pp. 9–12.\n     (b) The two jurisdictional provisions of the INA invoked by the \nGovernment do not apply.  Title 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), which bars re-\nview of claims arising from “action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to re-\nmove an alien,” is inapplicable where, as here, the parties do not chal-\nlenge any removal proceedings.  And the rescission is not a decision “to  \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders” \nwithin the meaning of §1252(g).  Pp. 12–13. \n   2. DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary  and capricious un-\nder the APA.  Pp. 13–26. \n     (a) In assessing the rescission, the Government urges the Court to \nconsider not just the contemporaneous explanation offered by Acting \nSecretary Duke but also  the additional reasons supplied by Secretary \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nNielsen nine months later.  Judicial review of agency action, however, \nis limited to “the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the \naction.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758.  If those grounds are \ninadequate, a court may  remand for the agency to offer “a fuller expla-\nnation of the agency’s reasoning at the time of the agency  action,” Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.  LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(emphasis added), or to “deal with the problem afresh” by taking  new  \nagency action, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.  S. 194, 201.  Because Sec-\nretary Nielsen chose not to take new action, she was limited to elabo-\nrating on the agency’s original reasons.  But her reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor and consists primarily of imper-\nmissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Citizens to Preserve  Overton Park, \nInc. v.  Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 420.  The rule requiring a new decision  \nbefore considering new reasons is not merely a  formality.  It serves \nimportant administrative law values by  promoting agency accounta-\nbility to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not \nsimply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.  \nEach of these values would be markedly undermined if this Court al-\nlowed DHS to  rely on reasons offered nine months after the rescission \nand after three different courts had identified flaws in the original ex-\nplanation.  Pp. 13–17. \n     (b)  Acting Secretary Duke’s  rescission memorandum failed to con-\nsider important aspects of the problem before the agency.  Although \nDuke was bound by the Attorney General’s determination that DACA \nis illegal, see 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1), deciding  how best to address that \ndetermination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.   \nActing Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority \nin winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope \nof her discretion.  The Attorney General concluded that the legal de-\nfects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.  \nThe Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on \nDAPA’s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it ex-\ntended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens.  But the \ndefining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHS’s decision to defer re-\nmoval, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance \ncomponent from the associated benefits eligibility.  Eliminating bene-\nfits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely \nwithin Duke’s  discretion.  Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in \nher decision, Duke treated the Attorney General’s conclusion regard-\ning the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and \nforbearance, without explanation.  That reasoning repeated the error \nin Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.  \nv. State Farm— treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy \nas sufficient to rescind the entire policy.   463 U. S. 29, 51.  While DHS \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \nwas not required to “consider all policy alternatives,” ibid., deferred \naction was “within the ambit of the existing” policy,  ibid.; indeed, it \nwas the centerpiece of the policy.  In failing to consider the option to \nretain deferred action, Duke “failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned \nanalysis.’ ” Id., at 57. \n \n   That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary  and capri-\ncious, but it was not the only defect.  Duke also failed to address \nwhether there was “legitimate reliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  \nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742.  Certain  \nfeatures of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance \ninterests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first \ninstance. DHS has flexibility in addressing  any reliance interests and \ncould have considered various accommodations.  While the agency was \nnot required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess \nthe existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them \nagainst competing policy concerns.  Its failure to do so was arbitrary  \nand capricious.  Pp. 17–26.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondents’ claims fail \nto establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by \nanimus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Pp. 27–29. \nROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the  Court, except as to Part IV.   \nGINSBURG,  BREYER,  and KAGAN, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and SO-\nTOMAYOR, J., joined as to all but Part IV.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt, except as to Part IV. \n  In the summer of 2012, the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) announced an immigration program known as \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  That \nprogram allows certain unauthorized aliens who entered \nthe United States as children to apply for a two-year for-\nbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief are also \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  \nSome  700,000  aliens  have  availed  themselves  of  this \nopportunity. \n  Five years later, the Attorney General advised DHS to \nrescind DACA, based on his conclusion that it was unlaw-\nful. The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memoran-\ndum terminating the program on that basis.  The termina-\ntion  was  challenged  by  affected  individuals  and  third\nparties who alleged, among other things, that the Acting \nSecretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by failing to adequately address important factors \nbearing on her decision.  For the reasons that follow, we \nconclude that the Acting Secretary did violate the APA, and \nthat the rescission must be vacated.  \nI \nA \n  In June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued \na memorandum announcing an immigration relief program \nfor “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 18–587, p. 97a  \n(App. to Pet. for Cert.).  Known as DACA, the program ap-\nplies to childhood arrivals who were under age 31 in 2012;\nhave continuously resided here since 2007; are current stu-\ndents, have completed high school, or are honorably dis-\ncharged veterans; have not been convicted of any serious \ncrimes; and do not threaten national security or public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsafety.  Id., at 98a.  DHS concluded that individuals who \nmeet these criteria warrant favorable treatment under the \nimmigration laws because they “lacked the intent to violate\nthe law,” are “productive” contributors to our society, and \n“know only this country as home.”  Id., at 98a–99a. \n  “[T]o prevent [these] low priority  individuals from being \nremoved from the United States,” the DACA Memorandum \ninstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “exer-\ncise prosecutorial discretion[] on an individual basis . . . by\n \ndeferring action for a period of two years, subject to re-\nnewal.”  Id., at 100a.  In addition, it directs U. S. Citizen-\nship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to “accept applica-\ntions to determine whether these individuals qualify for \nwork authorization during this period of deferred action,”  \nid., at 101a, as permitted under regulations long predating \nDACA’s creation, see 8  CFR §274a.12(c)(14) (2012) (permit-\nting work authorization for deferred action recipients who \nestablish “economic necessity”); 46 Fed. Reg. 25080–25081 \n(1981) (similar). Pursuant to other regulations, deferred ac-\ntion recipients are considered “lawfully present” for pur-\nposes of, and therefore eligible  to receive, Social Security  \nand Medicare benefits.  See 8 CFR §1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 CFR\n§417.422(h) (2012). \n  In November 2014, two years after DACA was promul-\ngated,  DHS  issued  a  memorandum  announcing  that  it \nwould expand DACA eligibility by removing the age cap, \nshifting the date-of-entry requirement from 2007 to 2010, \nand extending the deferred action and work authorization \nperiod to three years.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a–107a.  In \nthe same memorandum, DHS created a new, related pro-\ngram known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  That program \nwould have authorized deferred action for up to 4.3 million \nparents whose children were U. S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents.  These parents were to enjoy the same for-\nbearance,  work  eligibility,  and  other  benefits  as  DACA \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nrecipients.\n  Before the DAPA Memorandum was implemented, 26 \nStates, led by Texas, filed suit in the Southern District of \nTexas.  The States contended that DAPA and the DACA  \nexpansion violated the APA’s notice and comment require-\nment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the \nExecutive’s duty under the Take Care Clause of the Consti-\ntution. The District Court found that the States were likely \nto succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims and  \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring imple-\nmentation of both DAPA and the DACA expansion.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677–678 (2015). \n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.  Texas v. United  \nStates, 809 F. 3d 134, 188 (2015).  In opposing the injunc-\ntion, the Government argued that the DAPA Memorandum \nreflected an unreviewable exercise of the Government’s en-\nforcement discretion. The Fifth Circuit majority disagreed.  \nIt reasoned that the deferred action described in the DAPA  \nMemorandum was “much more than nonenforcement: It \nwould affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated \nbenefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”   Id., at 166.  \nFrom this, the majority concluded that the creation of the \nDAPA program was not an unreviewable action “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  Id., at 169 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2)).\n  The majority then upheld the injunction on two grounds.  \nIt first concluded the States were likely to succeed on their \nprocedural claim that the DAPA Memorandum was a sub-\nstantive rule that was required to undergo notice and com-\nment.  It then held that the APA required DAPA to be set \naside because the program was “manifestly contrary” to the \nINA, which “expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes” to “receive the benefits” as-\nsociated with “lawful presence” and to qualify for work  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthorization, 809 F. 3d, at 179–181, 186 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Judge King dissented. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote, which meant that no opinion was is-\nsued.  United States v.  Texas, 579 U. S. ___ (2016) (per cu-\nriam).  For the next year, litigation over DAPA and the\nDACA  expansion  continued  in  the  Southern  District  of \nTexas, while implementation of those policies remained \nenjoined. \n  Then, in June 2017, following a change in Presidential \nadministrations, DHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum.  \nIn explaining that decision, DHS cited the preliminary in-\njunction  and  ongoing  litigation  in  Texas,  the  fact  that \nDAPA had never taken effect, and the new administration’s  \nimmigration enforcement priorities.\n  Three  months  later,  in  September  2017,  Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson B. Sessions III sent a letter to Acting Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke, “advis[ing]” \nthat DHS “should rescind” DACA as well.  App. 877.  Citing\nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion and this Court’s equally divided \naffirmance, the Attorney General concluded that DACA \nshared the “same legal . . . defects that the courts recog-\nnized as to DAPA” and was “likely” to meet a similar fate.   \nId., at 878. “In light of the costs and burdens” that a rescis-\nsion would “impose[] on DHS,” the Attorney General urged \n \nDHS  to  “consider  an  orderly  and  efficient  wind-down \nprocess.”  Ibid.  \n  The next day, Duke acted on the Attorney General’s ad-\nvice.  In her decision memorandum, Duke summarized the  \nhistory of the DACA and DAPA  programs, the Fifth Circuit \nopinion and ensuing affirmance, and the contents of the At-\ntorney General’s letter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–117a.  \n“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the \nFifth Circuit’s rulings” and the “letter from the Attorney \nGeneral,” she concluded that the “DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Id., at 117a. \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Duke then detailed how the program would be wound \ndown: No new applications would be accepted, but DHS\nwould entertain applications for two-year renewals from \nDACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within \nsix months.  For all other DACA recipients, previously is-\nsued  grants  of  deferred  action  and  work  authorization  \nwould not be revoked but would expire on their own terms, \nwith no prospect for renewal.  Id., at 117a–118a. \nB \n  Within days of Acting Secretary  Duke’s rescission an-\nnouncement, multiple groups of plaintiffs ranging from in-\ndividual DACA recipients and States to the Regents of the \nUniversity of California and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People challenged her decision \nin the U. S. District Courts for the Northern District of Cal-\nifornia (Regents, No. 18–587), the Eastern District of New \nYork (Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589), and the District of Co-\nlumbia (NAACP, No. 18–588).  The relevant claims are that \nthe rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of\nthe APA and that it infringed the equal protection guaran-\ntee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.1  \n  All three District Courts ruled for the plaintiffs, albeit at \ndifferent stages of the proceedings.2  In doing so, each court \nrejected the Government’s threshold arguments that the \n—————— \n1Plaintiffs also raised notice and comment claims, which uniformly \n \nfailed below, and assorted due process challenges, some of which sur-\nvived motions to dismiss.  Those claims are not before us. \n2In a related challenge not at issue here, the District Court for the \n \nDistrict of Maryland granted partial summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment.  Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Se-\ncurity, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  After the Government filed petitions \nfor certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that deci-\nsion and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and ca-\npricious. Casa de  Maryland  v.  United States Dept. of Homeland Security, \n924 F. 3d 684 (2019), cert. pending, No. 18–1469.  The Fourth Circuit has  \nsince stayed its mandate.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims were unreviewable under the APA and that the INA \ndeprived the court of jurisdiction.  298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n223–224, 234–235 (DC 2018); 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1029–\n1033 (ND Cal. 2018); 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150, 153–154 \n(EDNY 2017).\nIn Regents and Batalla Vidal, the District Courts held  \nthat the equal protection claims were adequately alleged.  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1315 (ND Cal. 2018); 291 F. Supp. 3d \n260, 279 (EDNY 2018).  Those courts also entered coexten-\nsive nationwide preliminary injunctions, based on the con-\nclusion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the mer-\nits of their claims that the rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious. These injunctions did not require DHS to accept \nnew applications, but did order the agency to allow DACA\nrecipients to “renew their enrollments.”  279 F.  Supp. 3d, at \n1048; see 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437 (EDNY 2018). \nIn  NAACP,  the  D. C.  District  Court  took  a  different  \ncourse.  In  April 2018, it deferred ruling on the equal pro-\ntection challenge but granted partial summary judgment to \nthe plaintiffs on their APA claim, holding that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s “conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in [the agency’s] view of DACA’s lawful-\nness.”  298 F. Supp. 3d, at 243.  The District Court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit DHS to “reissue a memoran-\ndum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller expla-\nnation for the determination that the program lacks statu-\ntory and constitutional authority.”  Id., at 245.  \n  Two months later, Duke’s successor, Secretary Kirstjen \nM. Nielsen, responded via memorandum.  App. to Pet. for\nCert. 120a–126a.  She explained that, “[h]aving considered \nthe Duke memorandum,” she “decline[d] to disturb” the re-\nscission. Id., at 121a.  Secretary Nielsen went on to articu-\nlate her “understanding” of Duke’s memorandum, identify-\ning  three  reasons  why,  in  Nielsen’s  estimation,  “the\ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, \nsound.”  Ibid.  First, she reiterated that, “as the Attorney  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nGeneral concluded, the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  \nId., at 122a. Second, she added that, regardless, the agency\nhad “serious doubts about [DACA’s] legality” and, for law \nenforcement reasons, wanted to avoid “legally questiona-\nble” policies.   Id., at 123a.  Third, she identified multiple \npolicy reasons for rescinding DACA, including (1) the belief \nthat any class-based immigration relief should come from \nCongress,  not  through  executive  non-enforcement;  (2)\nDHS’s preference for exercising prosecutorial discretion on \n“a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and (3) the im-\nportance of “project[ing] a message” that immigration laws \nwould be enforced against all classes and categories of al-\niens.  Id., at 123a–124a.  In her final paragraph, Secretary \nNielsen acknowledged the “asserted reliance interests” in \nDACA’s continuation but concluded that they did not “out-\nweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the\nother reasons” for the rescission discussed in her memoran-\ndum.  Id., at 125a. \n  The Government asked the D. C. District Court to revise  \nits prior order in light of the reasons provided by Secretary \nNielsen, but the court declined.  In the court’s view, the new \nmemorandum, which “fail[ed] to elaborate meaningfully” \non the agency’s illegality rationale, still did not provide an \nadequate explanation for the September 2017 rescission.  \n315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 460, 473–474 (2018). \n  The Government appealed the various District Court de-\ncisions to the Second, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, respec-\ntively.  In November 2018, while those appeals were pend-\ning, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions \nfor certiorari before judgment.  After the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the nationwide injunction in  Regents, see 908 F. 3d  \n476 (2018), but before rulings from the other two Circuits, \nwe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases for ar-\ngument.  588 U.

S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nwhether the rescission was arbitrary and capricious in vio-\nlation of the APA, and (3) whether the plaintiffs have stated \nan equal protection claim. \nII  \n  The dispute before the Court is not whether DHS may \nrescind DACA.  All parties agree that it may.  The dispute\nis instead primarily about the procedure the agency fol-\nlowed in doing so. \n  The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal\nagencies are accountable to the public and their actions \nsubject to review by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U. S. 788, 796 (1992).  It requires agencies to engage in\n“reasoned decisionmaking,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.  S.  \n743, 750 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), and di-\nrects that agency actions be “set aside” if they are “arbi-\ntrary” or “capricious,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  Under this \n“narrow standard of review, . . . a court is not  to substitute  \nits judgment for that of the agency,”  FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 513 (2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted), but instead to assess only whether the de-\ncision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors \nand whether there has been a clear error of judgment,” Cit-\nizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, \n416 (1971).\n  But before determining whether the rescission was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, we must first address the Govern-\nment’s contentions that DHS’s decision is unreviewable  \nunder the APA and outside this Court’s jurisdiction. \nA \n  The APA establishes  a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview [for] one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-\ntion.’”  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140  \n \n(1967) (quoting §702).  That presumption can be rebutted \nby a showing that the relevant statute “preclude[s]” review,  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n§701(a)(1),  or  that  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to \nagency discretion by law,” §701(a)(2).  The latter exception \nis at issue here. \n  To “honor the presumption of review, we have read the \nexception in §701(a)(2) quite narrowly,” Weyerhaeuser Co. \nv. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 12), confining it to those rare “adminis-\ntrative decision[s] traditionally left to agency discretion,”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 191 (1993).  This limited cat-\negory of unreviewable actions includes an agency’s decision \nnot  to  institute  enforcement  proceedings,  Heckler  v.  \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985), and it is on that ex-\nception that the Government primarily relies. \nIn  Chaney,  several  death-row  inmates  petitioned  the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to take enforcement \naction against two States to prevent their use of certain \ndrugs for lethal injection.  The Court held that the FDA’s \ndenial of that petition was presumptively unreviewable in \nlight of the well-established “tradition” that “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce” is “generally commit-\nted to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id.,  at 831.  We \nidentified a constellation of reasons that underpin this tra-\ndition. To start, a non-enforcement decision “often involves \na  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  \nare  peculiarly  within  [the  agency’s]  expertise,”  such  as \n“whether the particular enforcement action requested best \nfits the agency’s overall policies.”  Ibid.  The decision also  \nmirrors, “to some extent,” a prosecutor’s decision not to in-\ndict, which has “long been regarded as the special province\nof the Executive Branch.”  Id., at 832.  And, as a practical \nmatter, “when an agency refuses to act” there is no action \nto “provide[] a focus for judicial review.”  Ibid. \n \n  The Government contends that a general non-enforcement \npolicy  is  equivalent  to  the  individual  non-enforcement \ndecision at issue in  Chaney.  In each case, the Government  \nargues, the agency must balance factors peculiarly within  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nits expertise, and does so in a manner akin to a criminal \nprosecutor.  Building on that premise, the Government ar-\ngues that the rescission of a non-enforcement policy is no  \ndifferent—for purposes of reviewability—from the adoption \nof that policy.  While the rescission may lead to increased \nenforcement, it does not, by itself, constitute a particular  \nenforcement action.  Applying this logic to the facts here, \nthe Government submits that DACA is a non-enforcement  \npolicy and that its rescission is therefore unreviewable. \n  But we need not test this chain of reasoning because \nDACA is not simply a non-enforcement policy.  For starters, \nthe DACA Memorandum did not merely “refus[e] to insti-\ntute proceedings” against a particular entity or even a par-\nticular class.   Ibid.  Instead, it directed USCIS to “establish  \na clear and efficient process” for identifying individuals who \nmet the enumerated criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  \nBased on this directive, USCIS solicited applications from \neligible aliens, instituted a standardized review process, \nand sent formal notices indicating whether the alien would \nreceive the two-year forbearance.  These proceedings are ef-\nfectively “adjudicat[ions].”  Id., at 117a.  And the result of \nthese adjudications—DHS’s decision to “grant deferred ac-\ntion,” Brief for Petitioners 45—is an “affirmative act of ap-\nproval,” the very opposite of a “refus[al] to act,” Chaney, 470  \nU. S., at 831–832.  In short, the DACA Memorandum does \nnot announce a passive non-enforcement policy; it created \na program for conferring affirmative immigration relief.  \nThe creation of that program—and its rescission—is an “ac-\ntion [that] provides a focus for judicial review.”  Id., at 832. \n  The  benefits  attendant  to  deferred  action  provide \nfurther confirmation that DACA is more than simply a  \nnon-enforcement policy.  As described above, by virtue of \nreceiving deferred action, the 700,000 DACA recipients may \nrequest work authorization and are eligible for Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare.  See supra, at 3.  Unlike an agency’s re-\nfusal to take requested enforcement action, access to these \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \ntypes of benefits is an interest “courts often are called upon \nto protect.”  Chaney, 470 U. S., at 832.  See also Barnhart v.  \nThomas, 540 U. S. 20 (2003) (reviewing eligibility determi-\nnation for Social Security benefits).\n  Because the DACA program  is more than a non-enforce-\nment policy, its rescission is subject to review under the\nAPA.  \nB \n  The Government also invokes two jurisdictional provi-\nsions of the INA as independent bars to review.  Neither \napplies. \n  Section 1252(b)(9) bars review of claims arising from “ac-\ntion[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  66 \nStat. 209, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9).  That tar-\ngeted language is not aimed at this sort of case.  As we have  \nsaid before, §1252(b)(9) “does not present a jurisdictional \nbar” where those bringing suit “are not asking  for review of \nan order of removal,” “the decision . . . to seek removal,” or  \n“the process by which . .  . removability will be determined.”  \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (plu-\nrality opinion) (slip op., at 10–11);  id., at ___ (BREYER, J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 31).  And it is certainly not a bar\nwhere, as here, the parties are not challenging any removal \nproceedings.\n  Section 1252(g) is similarly narrow.  That provision limits \nreview of cases “arising from” decisions “to commence pro-\nceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.”  \n§1252(g). We have previously rejected as “implausible” the \nGovernment’s suggestion that §1252(g) covers “all claims \narising from deportation proceedings” or imposes “a general \njurisdictional  limitation.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 482 (1999).  The re-\nscission, which revokes a deferred action program with as-\nsociated benefits, is not a decision to “commence proceed-\nings,”  much  less  to  “adjudicate”  a  case  or  “execute”  a  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nremoval order. \n  With these preliminary arguments out of the way, we \nproceed to the merits. \nIII  \nA \n  Deciding  whether  agency  action  was  adequately  ex-\nplained  requires,  first,  knowing  where  to  look  for  the \nagency’s explanation. The natural starting point here is the \nexplanation provided by Acting Secretary Duke when she \nannounced the rescission in September 2017. But the Gov-\nernment urges us to go on and consider the June 2018 mem-\norandum submitted by Secretary Nielsen as well.  That  \nmemo was prepared after the D. C. District Court vacated  \nthe Duke rescission and gave DHS an opportunity to “reis-\nsue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing \na fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks statutory and constitutional authority.”  298 F. Supp. \n3d, at 245. According to the Government, the Nielsen Mem-\norandum is properly before us because it was invited by the \nDistrict Court and reflects the views of the Secretary of  \nHomeland Security—the official responsible for immigra-\ntion policy. Respondents disagree, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemorandum, issued nine months after the rescission, im-\npermissibly asserts prudential and policy reasons not relied \nupon by Duke. \n  It is a “foundational principle of administrative law” that \njudicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Michigan, \n576 U. S., at 758.  If those grounds are inadequate, a court \nmay remand for the agency to do one of two things: First, \nthe agency can offer “a fuller explanation of  the agency’s \nreasoning at the time of the agency action.” Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(1990)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Alpharma,  Inc.  v.  \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nLeavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 5–6 (CADC 2006) (Garland, J.) (per-\nmitting an agency to provide an “amplified articulation” of \na prior “conclusory” observation (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  This route has important limitations.  When  an  \nagency’s initial explanation “indicate[s] the determinative \nreason for the final action taken,” the agency may elaborate \nlater on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new \nones. Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam).  \nAlternatively,  the  agency  can  “deal  with  the  problem\nafresh” by taking new agency action.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U. S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II).  An agency taking \nthis route is not limited to its prior reasons but must comply \nwith the procedural requirements for new agency action. \n  The District Court’s remand thus presented DHS with a \nchoice: rest on the Duke Memorandum while elaborating on \nits prior reasoning, or issue a new rescission bolstered by \nnew reasons absent from the Duke Memorandum.  Secre-\ntary Nielsen took the first path. Rather than making a new\ndecision, she “decline[d] to disturb the Duke memoran-\ndum’s rescission” and instead “provide[d] further explana-\ntion” for that action.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.  Indeed,  \nthe Government’s subsequent request for reconsideration \ndescribed the Nielsen Memorandum as “additional expla-\nnation for [Duke’s] decision” and asked the District Court \nto “leave in  place [Duke’s] September 5, 2017 decision to re-\nscind the DACA policy.”  Motion to Revise Order in No. 17– \ncv–1907 etc. (D DC), pp. 2, 19. Contrary to the position of \nthe  Government  before  this  Court,  and  of  JUSTICE  \nKAVANAUGH in dissent, post, at 4 (opinion concurring in \njudgment in part and dissenting in part), the Nielsen Mem-\norandum was by its own terms not a new rule implementing \na new policy.\n  Because Secretary Nielsen chose to elaborate on the rea-\nsons for the initial rescission rather than take new admin-\nistrative action, she was limited to the agency’s original rea-\nsons, and her explanation “must be viewed critically” to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nensure that the rescission is not upheld on the basis of im-\npermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Overton Park, 401 \nU. S., at 420.  But despite purporting to explain the Duke \nMemorandum, Secretary Nielsen’s reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor.  Acting Secretary \nDuke  rested the rescission on the conclusion that DACA is \nunlawful.  Period.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.  By con-\ntrast, Secretary Nielsen’s new memorandum offered three \n“separate and independently sufficient reasons” for the re-\nscission, id., at 122a, only the first of which is the conclusion \nthat DACA is illegal. \n  Her second reason is that DACA is, at minimum, legally \nquestionable and should be terminated to maintain public\nconfidence in the rule of law and avoid burdensome litiga-\ntion.  No such justification can be found in the Duke Mem-\norandum. Legal uncertainty is, of course, related to illegal-\nity.  But the two justifications are meaningfully distinct, \nespecially in this context.  While an agency might, for one \nreason or another, choose to do nothing in the face of uncer-\ntainty, illegality presumably requires remedial action of \nsome sort.  \n  The policy reasons that Secretary Nielsen cites as a third \nbasis for the rescission are also nowhere to be found in the \nDuke Memorandum.  That document makes no mention of \na preference for legislative fixes, the superiority of case-by-\ncase decisionmaking, the importance of sending a message \nof robust enforcement, or any other policy consideration.  \nNor are these points included in the legal analysis from the \nFifth Circuit and the Attorney General.  They can be viewed\nonly as impermissible post hoc rationalizations and thus  \nare not properly before us.\n  The Government, echoed by JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, pro-\ntests that requiring a new decision before considering Niel-\nsen’s new justifications would be “an idle and useless for-\nmality.”  NLRB  v. Wyman-Gordon  Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766, \n \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nn. 6 (1969) (plurality opinion).  See also post,  at 5.  Proce-\ndural requirements can often seem such. But here the rule \nserves important values of administrative law.  Requiring \na new decision before considering new reasons promotes \n“agency accountability,” Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., \n476 U. S. 610, 643 (1986), by ensuring that parties and the \npublic can respond fully and in a timely manner to an \nagency’s exercise of authority.  Considering only contempo-\nraneous explanations for agency action also instills confi-\ndence that the reasons given are not simply “convenient lit-\nigating position[s].”  Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham  \nCorp., 567 U. S. 142, 155 (2012) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Permitting agencies to invoke belated justifica-\ntions, on the other hand, can upset “the orderly functioning \nof the process of review,” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. \n80, 94 (1943), forcing both litigants and courts to chase a\nmoving target.  Each of these values would be markedly un-\ndermined were we to allow DHS to rely on reasons offered \nnine months after Duke announced the rescission and after \nthree different courts had identified flaws in the original \nexplanation.\nJUSTICE  KAVANAUGH  asserts  that  this  “foundational \nprinciple of administrative law,” Michigan, 576 U. S., at \n758, actually limits only what lawyers may argue, not what \nagencies may do. Post, at 5.  While it is true that the Court \nhas often rejected justifications belatedly advanced by ad-\nvocates, we refer to this as a prohibition on post hoc ration-\nalizations, not advocate rationalizations, because the prob-\nlem is the timing, not the speaker.  The functional reasons \nfor  requiring  contemporaneous  explanations  apply  with \nequal force regardless whether post hoc justifications are \nraised in court by those appearing on behalf of the agency\nor by agency officials themselves.  See American Textile  \nMfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 539 (1981) \n(“[T]he post hoc rationalizations of the agency . . . cannot \nserve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”); Overton  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPark, 401 U. S., at 419 (rejecting “litigation affidavits” from \nagency officials as “merely ‘post hoc’ rationalizations”).3  \n  Justice Holmes famously wrote that “[m]en must turn  \nsquare corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock \nIsland, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143  \n(1920).  But it is also true, particularly when so much is at \nstake, that “the Government should turn square corners in \ndealing with the people.”  St. Regis Paper Co. v. United \nStates, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting).  The \nbasic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.  This is not the  \ncase for cutting corners to allow DHS to rely upon reasons \nabsent from its original decision.  \nB \n  We turn, finally, to whether DHS’s decision to rescind \nDACA  was arbitrary and capricious.  As noted earlier, Act-\ning Secretary Duke’s justification for the rescission was suc-\ncinct: “Taking into consideration” the Fifth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that DAPA was unlawful because it conferred benefits \nin violation of the INA, and the Attorney General’s conclu-\nsion that DACA was unlawful for the same reason, she \nconcluded—without elaboration—that the “DACA program \nshould be terminated.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.4  \n—————— \n3  JUSTICE  KAVANAUGH further argues that the contemporaneous expla-\nnation  requirement  applies  only  to  agency  adjudications,  not  rule-\nmakings.  Post,  at 5–6 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part).  But he  cites no  authority limiting this basic principle—\nwhich the Court regularly articulates in the context of rulemakings—to \nadjudications.  The Government does not even raise this unheralded ar-\ngument.  \n4The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke  also focused \n \non litigation risk.  Although the background section of her memo refer-\nences a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge \nDACA, the memo never asserts that the rescission was intended to avert \nlitigation.  And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that the policy \nwas unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or de-\nfended in its current form—it is difficult to see how the risk of litigation  \n \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Respondents maintain that this explanation is deficient \nfor three reasons.  Their first and second arguments work \nin tandem, claiming that the Duke Memorandum does not \nadequately explain the conclusion that DACA is unlawful,  \nand that this conclusion is, in any event, wrong.  While \nthose arguments carried the day in the lower courts, in our \nview they overlook an important constraint on Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s decisionmaking authority—she was bound by\nthe Attorney General’s legal determination. \n  The same statutory provision that establishes the Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security’s authority to administer and en-\nforce immigration laws limits that authority, specifying \nthat, with respect to “all questions of law,” the determina-\ntions of the Attorney General “shall be controlling.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1103(a)(1).  Respondents are aware of this con-\nstraint.  Indeed they emphasized the point in the reviewa-\nbility sections of their briefs.  But in their merits argu-\nments, respondents never addressed whether or how this \nunique statutory provision might affect our review.  They\ndid not discuss whether Duke was required to explain a le-\ngal conclusion that was not hers to make.  Nor  did they dis-\ncuss whether the current suits challenging Duke’s rescis-\nsion decision, which everyone agrees was within her legal \nauthority under the INA, are proper vehicles for attacking \nthe Attorney General’s legal conclusion. \n  Because of these gaps in respondents’ briefing, we do not\nevaluate the claims challenging the explanation and cor-\nrectness of the illegality conclusion.  Instead we focus our \nattention on respondents’ third argument—that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke “failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of\nthe  problem”  before  her.  Motor  Vehicle  Mfrs.  Assn.  of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983). \n—————— \ncarried any independent weight.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Whether DACA is illegal is, of course, a legal determina-\ntion, and therefore a question for the Attorney General.  But \ndeciding how best to address a finding of illegality moving \nforward can involve important policy choices, especially \nwhen the finding concerns a program with the breadth of \nDACA.  Those policy choices are for DHS. \n  Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretion-\nary authority in winding down the program.  See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 117a–118a (listing the Acting Secretary’s de-\ncisions on eight transition issues).   Among other things, she \nspecified that those DACA recipients whose benefits were \nset to expire within six months were eligible for two-year \nrenewals.  Ibid. \n  But Duke did not appear to appreciate the full scope of \nher discretion, which picked up where the Attorney Gen-\neral’s legal reasoning left off.  The Attorney General con-\ncluded that “the DACA policy has the same legal . . . defects \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  App. 878.  So, to \nunderstand those defects, we look to the Fifth Circuit, the  \nhighest court to offer a reasoned opinion on the legality \nof DAPA.  That court described the “core” issue before it as \nthe “Secretary’s decision” to grant “eligibility for benefits”—\nincluding  work  authorization,  Social  Security,  and \nMedicare—to unauthorized aliens on “a class-wide basis.”   \nTexas, 809  F. 3d, at 170; see id., at 148, 184. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit’s focus on these benefits was central to every stage of \nits analysis.  See id., at 155 (standing); id., at 163 (zone of\ninterest); id., at 164 (applicability of §1252(g));  id., at 166 \n(reviewability); id., at 176–177 (notice and comment); id., at  \n184 (substantive APA).  And the Court ultimately held that \nDAPA was “manifestly contrary to  the INA” precisely be-\ncause it “would make 4.3 million otherwise removable al-\niens” eligible for work authorization and public benefits.  \nId., at 181–182 (internal quotation marks omitted).5  \n—————— \n5As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social  \n \n \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  But there is more to DAPA (and DACA) than such bene-\nfits.  The defining feature of deferred action is the decision \nto defer removal (and to notify the affected alien of that de-\ncision). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a.  And the Fifth Circuit  \nwas careful to distinguish that forbearance component from \neligibility for benefits. As it explained, the “challenged por-\ntion of DAPA’s deferred-action program” was the decision \nto make DAPA recipients eligible for benefits.  See Texas, \n809 F. 3d, at 168, and n. 108.  The other “[p]art of DAPA,” \nthe court noted, “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at \nleast temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as \nto a class of what he deem[ed] to be low-priority illegal al-\niens.”  Id., at 166.  Borrowing from this Court’s prior de-\nscription of deferred action, the Fifth Circuit observed that \n“the states do not challenge the Secretary’s decision to ‘de-\ncline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or de-\ncline to execute a final order of deportation.’”  Id., at 168 \n \n(quoting Reno, 525 U. S., at 484).  And the Fifth Circuit un-\nderscored that nothing in its decision or the preliminary in-\njunction “requires the Secretary  to remove any alien or to\nalter” the Secretary’s class-based “enforcement priorities.”   \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 166, 169.  In other words, the Secre-\ntary’s forbearance authority was unimpaired. \n  Acting Secretary Duke recognized that the Fifth Circuit’s \nholding addressed the benefits associated with DAPA.  In  \nher memorandum she explained that the Fifth Circuit con-\n—————— \nSecurity and Medicare benefits because they had been designated “law-\nfully present.” Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 168.  Lawful presence is a statutory  \nprerequisite for receipt of  certain benefits.  See id., at 148 (citing 8  \nU. S. C. §1611).  It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexo-\nrably from forbearance.  Thus, while deferred action recipients have been \ndesignated lawfully present for purposes of Social Security and Medicare \neligibility, see 8 CFR §1.3; 42 CFR §417.422(h), agencies can also exclude \nthem from this designation, see 45 CFR §152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that \nDACA recipients are not considered lawfully present for purposes of cov-\nerage under the Affordable Care Act). \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncluded that DAPA “conflicted with the discretion author-\nized by Congress” because the INA “‘flatly does not permit \n \nthe reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully\npresent and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of \nfederal and state benefits, including work authorization.’”  \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 114a (quoting Texas, 809 F. 3d, at  \n184).  Duke did not characterize the opinion as one about \nforbearance. \n  In short, the Attorney General neither addressed the for-\nbearance policy at the heart of DACA nor compelled DHS \nto abandon that policy.  Thus, removing benefits eligibility \nwhile continuing forbearance remained squarely within the \ndiscretion of Acting Secretary Duke, who was responsible \nfor “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement poli-\ncies and priorities.” 116 Stat. 2178, 6 U. S. C. §202(5).  But \nDuke’s memo offers no reason  for terminating forbearance.  \nShe instead treated the Attorney General’s conclusion re-\ngarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both \nbenefits and forbearance, without explanation. \n  That reasoning repeated the error we identified in one of \nour leading modern administrative law cases, Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.  There, the Na-\ntional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) \npromulgated a requirement that motor vehicles produced \nafter 1982 be equipped with one of two passive restraints: \nairbags or automatic seatbelts.  463 U. S., at 37–38, 46.  \nFour years later, before the requirement went into effect, \nNHTSA concluded that automatic seatbelts, the restraint of  \nchoice for most manufacturers, would not provide effective \nprotection.  Based on that premise, NHTSA rescinded the \npassive restraint requirement in full.  Id., at 38. \n  We concluded that the total rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As we explained, NHTSA’s justification sup-\nported only “disallow[ing] compliance by means of ” auto-\n \nmatic seatbelts.  Id., at 47.  It did “not cast doubt” on the  \n \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n“efficacy  of  airbag  technology”  or  upon  “the  need  for  a \npassive restraint standard.”  Ibid.  Given NHTSA’s prior \njudgment that “airbags are an effective and cost-beneficial \nlifesaving  technology,”  we  held  that  “the  mandatory\npassive restraint rule [could] not be abandoned without any \nconsideration whatsoever of an airbags-only requirement.”  \nId., at 51. \n  While the factual setting is different here, the error is the \nsame.  Even if it is illegal for DHS to extend work authori-\nzation and other benefits to DACA recipients, that conclu-\nsion supported only “disallow[ing]” benefits.  Id., at 47.  It \ndid “not cast doubt” on the legality of forbearance or upon \nDHS’s original reasons for extending forbearance to child-\nhood arrivals.  Ibid.  Thus, given DHS’s earlier judgment \nthat  forbearance  is  “especially  justified”  for  “productive  \nyoung  people”  who  were  brought  here  as  children  \nand “know only this country as home,”  App. to Pet. for \nCert. 98a–99a, the DACA Memorandum could not be re-\nscinded in full “without any consideration whatsoever” of a \nforbearance-only policy, State Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.6  \n  The Government acknowledges that “[d]eferred action \ncoupled with the associated benefits are the two legs upon \nwhich the DACA policy stands.”  Reply Brief 21.  It insists, \nhowever, that “DHS was not required to consider whether \nDACA’s illegality could be addressed by separating” the \n—————— \n6The three-page memorandum that established DACA is devoted en-\n \ntirely to forbearance, save for one sentence directing USCIS  to “deter-\nmine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work authorization.”  App. \nto Pet. for Cert. 101a.  The benefits associated with DACA flow from a  \nseparate  regulation.  See  8  CFR  §1.3(a)(4)(vi);  see  also  42  CFR \n§417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR §1.3).  Thus, DHS could have ad-\ndressed the Attorney General’s determination that such benefits were \nimpermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR §1.3 to exclude DACA \nrecipients from those benefits without rescinding the DACA Memoran-\ndum and the  forbearance policy it established.  But Duke’s rescission  \nmemo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo.  Ibid.   According to the Government, “It was not arbi-\ntrary and capricious for DHS to view deferred action and its \ncollateral benefits as importantly linked.”  Ibid.  Perhaps.  \nBut that response misses the point. The fact that there may \nbe a valid reason not to separate deferred action from ben-\nefits does not establish that DHS considered that option or \nthat such consideration was unnecessary. \n  The lead dissent acknowledges that forbearance and ben-\nefits are legally distinct and can be decoupled.  Post, at 21– \n22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J). It contends, however, that \nwe should not “dissect” agency action “piece by piece.”  Post,  \nat 21.  The dissent instead rests on the Attorney General’s\nlegal determination—which considered only benefits—“to \nsupply the ‘reasoned analysis’” to support rescission of both \n \nbenefits and forbearance.  Post, at 22 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U. S., at 42).  But State Farm teaches that when an  \nagency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the “alternative[s]” that are “within the ambit of \nthe existing [policy].”  Id., at 51.  Here forbearance was not \nsimply “within the ambit of the existing [policy],” it was the \ncenterpiece of the policy: DACA, after all, stands for “De-\nferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n111a (emphasis added).  But the rescission memorandum  \ncontains no discussion of forbearance or the option of retain-\ning forbearance without benefits.  Duke “entirely failed to \nconsider [that] important aspect of the problem.”  State \nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43.  \n  That omission alone renders Acting  Secretary Duke’s de-\ncision arbitrary and capricious.  But it is not the only defect.   \nDuke also failed to address whether there was “legitimate \nreliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  Smiley v. Citibank  \n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996).  When  an \nagency changes course, as DHS did here, it must “be cogni-\nzant that longstanding policies may have ‘engendered seri-\nous reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” \n \nEncino Motorcars, LLC  v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) \n \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n(slip op., at 9) (quoting Fox Television, 556 U. S., at 515).  “It \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”   \nId., at 515.  Yet that is what the Duke Memorandum did. \n  For its part, the Government does not contend that Duke \nconsidered potential reliance interests; it counters that she \ndid not need to.  In the Government’s view, shared by the \nlead dissent, DACA recipients have no “legally cognizable \nreliance interests” because the DACA Memorandum stated  \nthat the program “conferred no substantive rights” and pro-\nvided benefits only in two-year increments. Reply Brief 16–\n17; App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a. See also post, at 23–24 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J). But neither the Government nor the lead  \ndissent cites any legal authority establishing that such fea-\ntures automatically preclude reliance interests, and we are \nnot aware of any. These disclaimers are surely pertinent in \nconsidering the strength of any reliance interests, but that\nconsideration must be undertaken by the agency in the first \ninstance, subject to normal APA review.  There was no such  \nconsideration in the Duke Memorandum. \n  Respondents and their amici assert that there was much \nfor DHS to consider.  They stress that, since 2012, DACA\nrecipients have “enrolled in degree programs, embarked on \ncareers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even  \nmarried and had children, all in reliance” on the DACA pro-\ngram.  Brief for Respondent Regents of Univ. of California \net al. in No. 18–587, p.  41 (Brief for Regents).  The conse-\nquences of the rescission, respondents emphasize, would \n“radiate outward” to DACA recipients’ families, including \ntheir 200,000 U. S.-citizen children, to the schools where \nDACA recipients study and teach, and to the employers who\nhave invested time and money in training them. See id., at \n41–42; Brief for Respondent State of New York et al. in No. \n18–589, p. 42 (Brief for New York).  See also Brief for 143 \nBusinesses as Amici Curiae 17 (estimating that hiring and\ntraining replacements would cost employers $6.3 billion).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIn addition, excluding DACA recipients from the lawful la-\nbor force may, they tell us, result in the loss of $215 billion \nin economic activity and an associated $60 billion in federal \ntax revenue over the next ten years.  Brief for Regents 6.  \nMeanwhile, States and local governments could lose $1.25 \nbillion in tax revenue each year.  Ibid.  \n  These are certainly noteworthy concerns, but they are not \nnecessarily dispositive.  To the Government and lead dis-\nsent’s point, DHS could respond that reliance on forbear-\nance and benefits was unjustified in light of the express lim-\nitations in the DACA Memorandum.  Or it might conclude \nthat reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful \nare entitled to no or diminished weight.  And, even if DHS \nultimately concludes that the reliance interests rank as se-\nrious, they are but one factor to consider.  DHS may deter-\nmine, in the particular context before it, that other interests \nand policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests.  Mak-\ning that difficult decision was the agency’s  job, but the \nagency failed to do it.\n  DHS has considerable flexibility in carrying out its re-\nsponsibility.  The wind-down here is a good example of the \nkind of options available.  Acting Secretary Duke author-\nized DHS to process two-year renewals for those DACA re-\ncipients  whose  benefits  were  set  to  expire  within  six \nmonths.  But Duke’s consideration was solely for the pur-\npose of assisting the agency in dealing with “administrative \ncomplexities.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a–118a.  She should \nhave considered whether she had similar flexibility in ad-\ndressing any reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nlead dissent contends that accommodating such interests \nwould be “another exercise of unlawful power,” post, at 23 \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the Government does not make\nthat argument and DHS has already extended benefits for \npurposes other than reliance, following consultation with \nthe Office of the Attorney General.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n116a. \n \n\n26   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Had Duke considered reliance interests, she might, for \nexample, have considered a broader renewal period based\non the need for DACA recipients to reorder their affairs.  Al-\nternatively, Duke might have considered more accommo-\ndating termination dates for recipients caught in the mid-\ndle of a time-bounded commitment, to allow them to, say, \ngraduate from their course of study, complete their military \nservice, or finish a medical treatment regimen.  Or she  \nmight have instructed immigration officials to give salient \nweight to any reliance interests engendered by DACA when \nexercising individualized enforcement discretion.\n  To be clear, DHS was not required to do any of this or to \n“consider all policy alternatives in reaching [its] decision.”  \nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.  Agencies are not compelled to\nexplore “every alternative device and thought conceivable \nby the mind of man.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, \n551 (1978).  But, because DHS was “not writing on a blank \nslate,” post, at 22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), it was re-\nquired to assess whether there were reliance interests, de-\ntermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.\n  The lead dissent sees all the foregoing differently.  In its \nview, DACA is illegal, so any actions under DACA are them-\nselves illegal.  Such actions, it argues, must cease immedi-\nately and the APA should not be construed to impede that \nresult.  See post, at 19–23 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  The dissent is correct that DACA was rescinded because \nof  the  Attorney  General’s  illegality  determination.    See  \nante, at 20.  But nothing about that determination fore-\nclosed or even addressed the options of retaining forbear-\nance or accommodating particular reliance interests.  Act-\ning Secretary Duke should have considered those matters \nbut did not.  That failure was arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  27  \n \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nIV \n  Lastly, we turn to respondents’ claim that the rescis-\nsion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n  The parties dispute the proper framing of this claim.  The  \nGovernment contends that the allegation that the Execu-\ntive, motivated by animus, ended a program that dispropor-\ntionately benefits certain ethnic groups is a selective en-\nforcement claim.  Such a claim, the Government asserts,  \nis barred by our decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee.  See 525 U. S., at 488 (holding \nthat “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitu-\ntional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation”).  Respondents counter that their \nclaim falls outside the scope of that precedent because they \nare not challenging individual enforcement proceedings.  \nWe need not resolve this debate because, even if the claim \nis cognizable, the allegations here are insufficient. \n  To plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible infer-\nence that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a moti-\nvating factor” in the relevant decision.  Arlington Heights v.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, \n266 (1977). Possible evidence includes disparate impact on \na particular group, “[d]epartures from the normal proce-\ndural sequence,” and “contemporary statements by mem-\nbers of the decisionmaking body.”  Id., at 266–268.  Track-\ning  these  factors,  respondents  allege  that  animus  is\nevidenced by (1) the disparate impact of the rescission on \nLatinos from Mexico, who represent 78% of DACA recipi-\nents; (2) the unusual history behind the rescission; and \n(3) pre- and post-election statements by President Trump.  \nBrief for New York 54–55. \n  None of these points, either singly or in concert, estab-\nlishes a plausible equal protection claim.  First, because \nLatinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien\npopulation, one would expect them to make up an outsized \n \n\n28   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nshare of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief  \nprogram. See B. Baker, DHS, Office of Immigration Statis-\ntics,  Population  Estimates,  Illegal  Alien  Population \nResiding in the United States: January 2015, Table 2 (Dec. \n2018),  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\n18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf.  Were this fact suffi-\ncient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable im-\nmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection \ngrounds. \n  Second, there is nothing irregular about the history lead-\ning up to the September 2017 rescission.  The lower courts  \nconcluded that “DACA received reaffirmation by [DHS] as \nrecently as three months before the rescission,” 908 F. 3d, \nat 519 (quoting 298 F. Supp. 3d, at 1315), referring to the \nJune 2017 DAPA rescission memo, which stated that DACA \nwould “remain in effect,” App. 870.  But this reasoning con-\nfuses abstention with reaffirmation.  The DAPA memo did \nnot address the merits of the DACA policy or its legality.  \nThus, when the Attorney General later determined that \nDACA  shared  DAPA’s  legal  defects,  DHS’s  decision  to  \nreevaluate DACA was not a “strange about-face.”  908 F. 3d,  \nat 519.  It was a natural response to a newly identified \nproblem.\n  Finally, the cited statements are unilluminating.  The  \nrelevant actors were most directly Acting Secretary Duke \nand the Attorney General.  As the Batalla Vidal court  \nacknowledged, respondents did not “identif[y] statements\nby [either] that would give rise to an inference of discrimi-\nnatory motive.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 278. Instead, respond-\nents contend that President Trump made critical state-\nments  about  Latinos  that  evince  discriminatory  intent.  \nBut,  even  as  interpreted  by  respondents,  these  state-\nments—remote in time and made in unrelated contexts— \ndo not qualify as “contemporary statements” probative of \nthe decision at issue.  Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 268.   \nThus, like respondents’ other points, the statements fail to \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nraise a plausible inference that the rescission was moti-\nvated by animus. \n*  *  * \n  We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are \nsound policies.  “The wisdom” of those decisions “is none of \nour concern.”  Chenery  II, 332 U. S., at 207.  We address \nonly whether the agency complied with the procedural re-\nquirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its ac-\ntion. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous is-\nsues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything \nto do about the hardship to DACA recipients.  That dual  \nfailure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated \nthe scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a \nreasonable manner.  The appropriate recourse is therefore \nto remand to DHS so that it may consider the problem  \nanew. \n  The judgment in NAACP, No. 18–588, is affirmed.7  The  \njudgment in Regents, No. 18–587, is vacated in part and re-\nversed in part.  And in Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589, the Feb-\nruary 13, 2018 order granting respondents’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction is vacated, the November 9, 2017 or-\nder partially denying the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis affirmed in part, and the March  29, 2018 order partially \ndenying the balance of the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis reversed in part. All three cases are remanded for further  \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n—————— \n7Our affirmance of the  NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it \n \nunnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope of the in-\njunctions issued by the District Courts in  Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \n  The majority rightly holds that the Department of Home-\nland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri-\nvals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any chal-\nlenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  \nI believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing \nrecord and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would \ninstead permit respondents to develop their equal protec-\ntion claims on remand. \n  Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in  a \npreliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at \nthis stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that \nwould “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that \n[a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,  678 (2009).  The three courts to eval-\nuate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared \nthis modest threshold.  908 F. 3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) \n(affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018). \n  I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on re-\nmand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts \nthat plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality \ndisagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either sin-\ngly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection \nclaim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by dis-\ncounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly view-\ning the rest.\n  First, the plurality dismisses the statements that Presi-\ndent Trump made both  before and after he assumed office.  \nThe  Batalla  Vidal  complaints  catalog  then-candidate \nTrump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people \nthat have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, \ndrug dealers, [and] rapists.” 291 F.  Supp. 3d, at 276 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints ad-\n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nditionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement compar-\ning undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for \n“the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling \nand trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 \n(ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nplurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote \nin time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  \nAnte, at 28.  \n  But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered \napproach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements \nas remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Ha-\nwaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements \narise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migra-\ntion from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s cam-\npaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, ac-\ncording to respondents, were an animating force behind the \nrescission of DACA. Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proc-\nlamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred \nentry of individuals from several Muslim-majority coun-\ntries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign state-\nments about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the \nPresident” help to “create the strong perception” that the \nrescission  decision  was  “contaminated  by  impermissible \ndiscriminatory  animus.”  585  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of  \nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides\nrespondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection \nclaims further. \n  Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate im-\npact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering \nthis point in isolation. Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient \nto state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immi-\ngration  policy  could  be  challenged  on  equal  protection\ngrounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be \nviewed in the context of the President’s public statements \non and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nstage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an \nexecutive decision disproportionately harms the same ra-\ncial group that the President branded as less desirable mere \nmonths earlier. \n  Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “spe-\ncific sequence of events leading up to the challenged deci-\nsion.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late  \nas  June  2017,  DHS  insisted  it  remained  committed  to \nDACA, even while rescinding a related program, the De-\nferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Perma-\nnent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months  \nlater,  DHS  terminated  DACA  without,  as  the  plurality \nacknowledges, considering important aspects of the termi-\nnation.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests \nthat something other than questions about the legality of \nDACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it \nraises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the \ndecision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Depart-\nment of Commerce  v.  New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) \n(slip op., at 26).  Only by bypassing context does the plural-\nity conclude otherwise. \n*  *  * \n  The facts in respondents’ complaints create more than a\n“sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  \nIqbal, 556 U. S., at 678.  Whether they ultimately amount \nto actionable discrimination should be determined only af-\nter factual development on remand.  Because the Court  \nprematurely  disposes  of  respondents’  equal  protection \nclaims by overlooking the strength of their complaints, I \njoin all but Part IV of the opinion and do not concur in the \ncorresponding part of the judgment. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Between 2001 and 2011, Congress considered over two \ndozen bills that would have granted lawful status to mil-\nlions of aliens who were illegally brought to this country as \nchildren.  Each of those legislative efforts failed.  In the \nwake of this impasse, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (DHS) under President Barack Obama took matters  \ninto its own hands.  Without any purported delegation of \nauthority from Congress and without undertaking a rule-\nmaking, DHS unilaterally created a program known as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  The three-\npage DACA memorandum made it possible for approxi-\nmately 1.7 million illegal aliens to qualify for temporary \nlawful  presence  and  certain  federal  and  state  benefits.  \nWhen President Donald Trump took office in  2017, his Act-\ning Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through yet an-\nother memorandum, rescinded the DACA memorandum.  \nTo state it plainly, the Trump administration rescinded \nDACA the same way that the Obama administration cre-\nated it: unilaterally, and through a mere memorandum. \n  Today the majority makes the mystifying determination \nthat this rescission of DACA was unlawful.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the majority acts as though it is engaging \nin the routine application of standard principles of admin-\nistrative law. On the contrary, this is anything but a stand-\nard administrative law case. \n  DHS created DACA during the Obama administration \nwithout  any  statutory  authorization  and  without  going \nthrough the requisite rulemaking process.  As a result, the  \nprogram was unlawful from its inception.  The majority \ndoes not even attempt to explain why a court has the au-\nthority to scrutinize an agency’s policy reasons for rescind-\ning an unlawful program under the arbitrary and capri-\ncious microscope. The decision to countermand an unlawful \nagency action is clearly reasonable.  So long as the agency’s \ndetermination of illegality is sound, our review should be at \nan end. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an ef-\nfort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct \ndecision. The Court could have made clear that the solution  \nrespondents seek must come from the Legislative Branch.  \nInstead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS’ initial \noverreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.  In \ndoing so, it has given the green light for future political bat-\ntles to be fought in this Court rather than where they right-\nfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes \nthe Court’s duty to apply the law according to neutral prin-\nciples, and the ripple effects of the majority’s error will be \nfelt throughout our system of self-government. \n  Perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority’s holding \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing ad-\nministrations.  Under the auspices of today’s decision, ad-\nministrations  can  bind  their  successors  by  unlawfully \nadopting  significant  legal  changes  through  Executive \nBranch agency memoranda.  Even if the agency lacked au-\nthority to effectuate the changes, the changes cannot be un-\ndone by the same agency in a successor administration un-\nless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications to \nthe satisfaction of this Court.  In other words, the majority \nerroneously holds that the agency is not only permitted, but \nrequired,  to  continue  administering  unlawful  programs \nthat it inherited from a previous administration. I respect-\nfully dissent in part.1  \nI \nA \n  In 2012, after more than two dozen attempts by Congress \nto grant lawful status to aliens who were brought to this \ncountry as children,2 the then-Secretary of Homeland Secu-\nrity Janet Napolitano announced, by memorandum, a new \n—————— \n1I concur in the judgment insofar as the majority rejects respondents’  \n \nequal protection claim. \n2See Immigrant Children’s  Educational Advancement and Dropout \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The memorandum di-\nrected immigration enforcement officers not to remove “cer-\ntain young people who were brought to this country as chil-\ndren” that  met delineated criteria.   Id., at 97a–98a.  In the \nSecretary’s view, the program was consistent with “the \nframework  of the existing law.”  Id., at 101a. \n  DACA granted a renewable 2-year period of “deferred ac-\ntion” that made approximately 1.7 million otherwise remov-\nable aliens eligible to remain in this country temporarily.3   \nBy granting deferred action, the memorandum also made \nrecipients eligible for certain state and federal benefits, in-\ncluding  Medicare  and  Social  Security.

Despite  these \nchanges, the memorandum contradictorily claimed that it \n“confer[red] no substantive right [or] immigration status,” \nbecause “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 18–587, at 101a. \n  In 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh John-\nson broadened the deferred-action program in yet another \nbrief memorandum.  This 2014 memorandum expanded\nDACA eligibility by extending the deferred-action period to \nthree years and by relaxing other criteria.  It also imple-\nmented a related program, known as Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  DAPA allowed unlawfully present parents to ob-\ntain deferred action derivatively through their children who \nwere either citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Ap-\nproximately 4.3 million aliens qualified for DAPA and, as \nwith DACA, these individuals would have become eligible \nfor certain federal and state benefits upon the approval of \ntheir DAPA applications.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF. 3d 134, 181 (CA5 2015).  Nevertheless, the 2014 memo-\nrandum repeated the incongruous assertion that these pro-\ngrams “d[id] not confer any form of legal status in this coun-\ntry” and added that deferred action “may be terminated at \nany time at the agency’s discretion.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. \nin No. 18–587, at 104a. \nB \n  Twenty-six States filed suit to enjoin the implementation \nof  these  new  programs,  DAPA  and  “expanded  DACA,” \nmaintaining that they violated the Constitution, the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA).  The States contended that, \nbecause the 2014 memorandum allowed aliens to receive \ndeferred action and other benefits, it amounted to a legisla-\ntive rule that had to comply with the APA’s notice  and \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The States also argued that DHS’ de-\ncision to recategorize an entire class of aliens from “unlaw-\nfully present” to “lawfully present” exceeded its statutory \nauthority under the federal immigration laws.  According \nto the States, these defects rendered the 2014 memoran-\ndum arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.  \n  The District Court preliminarily enjoined DAPA and ex-\npanded DACA.  The Fifth Circuit  affirmed, rejecting DHS’ \nclaim that the programs were an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion.  Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 167, 188.  The court con-\ncluded that the States were likely to succeed on their claim \nthat the 2014 memorandum was a legislative rule that had \nto be adopted through notice and comment rulemaking.  Id., \nat 171–178.  The court further concluded that the 2014  \nmemorandum was “substantively contrary to law” because\nthe INA did not grant DHS the statutory authority to im-\nplement either program.  Id., at 170, 178–186. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 579 U. S. ___ \n(2016) (per curiam).  \nC \n  The 2014 memorandum was rescinded on June 15, 2017, \nbefore taking effect.  Shortly after that rescission, several \nof the plaintiff States sent a letter to then-Attorney General \nJefferson Sessions III. They contended that the 2012 DACA \nmemorandum was also legally defective because, “just like \nDAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for . . . lawful \npresence without any statutory authorization from Con-\ngress.” App. 873.  The States wrote that they would amend \ntheir complaint to challenge DACA if the administration \ndid not rescind the 2012 memorandum creating DACA by \nSeptember 5, 2017.\n  On September 4, then-Attorney General Sessions wrote \nto  then-Acting  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Elaine  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nDuke, advising her to rescind DACA.  Sessions stated that, \nin his legal opinion, DACA took effect “through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no es-\ntablished end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a simi-\nlar result.  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigra-\ntion laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by \nthe Executive Branch.”  Id., at 877.  The letter also stated \nthat DACA was infected with the “same legal . . . defects  \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA,” id., at  878, and thus \nDACA would likely be enjoined as well. \n  Then-Acting Secretary Duke  rescinded DACA the next \nday, also through a memorandum.  Her memorandum be-\ngan by noting that DACA “purported to use deferred action \n. . . to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress \nhad not otherwise acted to provide by law.” App. to Pet. for  \nCert. in No. 18–587, at 112a.  It described the history of the\nFifth Circuit litigation, noting that the court had concluded \nthat DAPA “conflicted with the discretion authorized by  \nCongress”  because  “the [INA] flatly does not permit the  \nreclassification  of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully pre-\nsent.”  Id., at 114a (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fi-\nnally, the memorandum accepted then-Attorney General \nSessions’ legal determination that DACA was unlawful for \nthe same reasons as DAPA.  See §1103(a)(1). In light of the\nlegal conclusions reached by the Fifth Circuit and the At-\ntorney General, then-Acting Secretary Duke set forth the \nprocedures for winding down DACA. \n  These three cases soon followed.  In each, respondents\nclaimed, among other things, that DACA’s rescission was \narbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  APA.    Two  District  \nCourts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while \nthe third vacated the rescission. \nII \n  “‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nuntil Congress confers power upon it.’”  Arlington v. FCC, \n \n569 U. S. 290, 317 (2013) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quot-\ning Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355,  \n374 (1986)).  When an  agency exercises power beyond the\nbounds of its authority, it acts unlawfully.  See, e.g., SAS  \nInstitute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___, ___, n. (2018) (slip op., \nat 11, n.).  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA provides \na poignant illustration of ultra vires agency action.\n  DACA alters how the immigration laws apply to a certain \nclass of aliens.  “DACA [recipients] primarily entered the \ncountry either by overstaying a visa or by entering without \ninspection, and the INA instructs that aliens in both classes \nare removable.”  Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662, 713 (SD Tex. 2018) (footnote omitted).  But DACA \ngranted its recipients deferred action, i.e., a decision to “de-\ncline  to  institute  [removal]  proceedings,  terminate  [re-\nmoval] proceedings, or decline to institute a final order of \n[removal].”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  \nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Under other regulations, recipients of deferred \naction are deemed lawfully present for purposes of certain \nfederal benefits. See supra, at 4. Thus, DACA in effect cre-\nated a new exception to the statutory provisions governing \nremovability and, in the process, conferred lawful presence \non an entire class of aliens.  \n  To  lawfully  implement  such  changes,  DHS  needed  a \ngrant of authority from Congress to either reclassify remov-\nable DACA recipients as lawfully present, or to exempt the \nentire class of aliens covered by DACA from statutory re-\nmoval procedures. No party disputes that the immigration \nstatutes lack an express delegation to accomplish either re-\nsult.  And, an examination of the highly reticulated immi-\ngration regime makes clear that DHS has no implicit dis-\ncretion to create new classes of lawful presence or to grant \nrelief from  removal out of whole cloth.  Accordingly, DACA  \nis substantively unlawful. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  This conclusion should begin and  end our review.  The  \ndecision to rescind an unlawful agency action is per se law-\nful. No additional policy justifications or considerations are  \nnecessary.  And, the majority’s contrary holding—that an \nagency is not only permitted, but required, to continue an  \nultra vires action—has no basis in  law. \nA \n  Congress has not authorized DHS to reclassify an entire \nclass of removable aliens as lawfully present or to categori-\ncally exempt aliens from statutory removal provisions.  \n1 \n  I begin with lawful presence.  As just stated, nothing in \nthe federal immigration laws expressly delegates to DHS\nthe unfettered discretion to create new categories of law-\nfully present aliens.  And, there is no basis for concluding \nthat Congress implicitly delegated to DHS the power to re-\nclassify categories of aliens as lawfully present.  The immi-\ngration statutes provide numerous ways to obtain lawful \npresence, both temporary and permanent.  The highly de-\ntailed nature of these provisions indicates that Congress \nhas exhaustively provided for all of  the ways that it thought \nlawful presence should be obtainable, leaving no discretion \nto DHS to add new pathways. \n  For example, federal immigration laws provide over 60\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa options, including visas for \nambassadors, full-time students and their spouses and chil-\ndren, those engaged to marry a United States citizen within \n90 days of arrival, athletes and performers, and aliens with \nspecialized  knowledge  related  to  their  employers.    See  \n§§1101(a)(15)(A)–(V), 1184; 8 CFR §214.1; see also Congres-\nsional Research Service, J. Wilson, Nonimmigrant and Im-\nmigrant Visa Categories: Data Brief 1–6 (2019) (Table 1).  \nIn addition, the statutes permit the Attorney General to \ngrant temporary “parole” into the  United States “for urgent \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nhumanitarian reasons or [a] significant public benefit,” 8 \nU. S. C.  §1182(d)(5)(A);  provide  for  temporary  protected \nstatus when the Attorney General finds that removal to a\ncountry with an ongoing armed conflict “would pose a seri-\nous threat to [an alien’s] personal safety,” §1254a(b)(1)(A); \nand allow the Secretary of Homeland Security (in consulta-\ntion with the Secretary  of State) to waive visa requirements \nfor certain aliens for up to 90 days, §§1187(a)–(d). \n  The immigration laws are equally complex and detailed \nwhen it comes to obtaining lawful permanent residence.  \nCongress  has  expressly  specified  numerous  avenues  for  \nobtaining an immigrant visa, which aliens  may then use  \nto become lawful permanent residents.  §§1201, 1255(a).   \nAmong  other  categories, immigrant visas are available to \nspecified  family-sponsored aliens, aliens with advanced de-\ngrees or exceptional abilities, certain types of skilled and \nunskilled workers, “special immigrants,” and those enter-\ning the country to “engag[e] in a new commercial enter-\nprise.”  §§1153(a)–(b),  1154;  see  also  Congressional  Re-\nsearch  Service,  Nonimmigrant  and  Immigrant  Visa \nCategories, at 6–7 (Table 2).  Refugees and asylees also may \nreceive lawful permanent residence under certain condi-\ntions, §1159; 8 CFR §§209.1, 209.2.4  As with  temporary  \nlawful presence,  each  avenue to lawful  permanent resi-\ndence status has its own set of rules and exceptions.5  \n  As the Fifth Circuit held in the DAPA litigation, a conclu-\nsion with which then-Attorney General Sessions agreed, \n“specific and detailed provisions[ of] the INA expressly and \n—————— \n4The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful perma-\n \nnent residence status.  See §1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) (two years for spouses to \ndemonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of \nprocuring an  alien’s admission as an immigrant”); §1186b (qualifying  \nbusiness entrepreneurs). \n5For instance, Congress has  carved out rules for aliens who served in \n \nthe Armed Forces, §§1438–1440, and alien spouses who have been sub-\nject to domestic abuse, §§1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In light of this elaborate statutory scheme, the lack of \nany similar provision for DACA recipients convincingly es-\ntablishes that Congress left DHS with no discretion to cre-\nate an additional class of aliens eligible for lawful presence.  \nCongress knows well how to provide broad discretion, and\nit has provided open-ended delegations of authority in stat-\nutes too numerous to name.  But when it comes to lawful \npresence, Congress did something strikingly different.  In-\nstead of enacting  a statute with “broad general directives” \nand leaving it to the agency to fill in the lion’s share of the \ndetails,  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.  S.  361,  372 \n(1989), Congress put in place intricate specifications gov-\nerning eligibility for lawful presence.  This comprehensive \nscheme indicates that DHS has no discretion to supplement \nor amend the statutory provisions in any manner, least of \nall by memorandum.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (An agency “may not \nexercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with \nthe administrative structure that Congress enacted” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); see also ETSI Pipeline Pro-\nject v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 509–510 (1988). \n2 \n  The relief that Congress has extended to removable al-\niens likewise confirms that DACA exceeds DHS’ delegated \nauthority.  Through deferred action, DACA grants tempo-\nrary relief to removable aliens on a programmatic scale.  \nSee Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d, at 714.  But as with lawful pres-\nence, Congress did not expressly grant DHS the authority \nto create categorical exceptions to the statute’s removal re-\nquirements.  And again, as with lawful presence, the intri-\ncate level of detail in the federal immigration laws regard-\ning  relief  from  removal  indicates  that  DHS  has  no  \ndiscretionary authority to supplement that relief with an  \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nentirely new programmatic exemption.\n  At the outset, Congress clearly knows how to provide for \nclasswide deferred action when it wishes to do so.  On mul-\ntiple  occasions,  Congress  has  used  express  language  to \nmake certain classes of individuals eligible for deferred ac-\ntion. See 8 U. S. C. §§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (certain indi-\nviduals covered under the Violence Against Women Act are \n“eligible for deferred action”); Victims of Trafficking and Vi-\nolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522 (“‘Any individ-\n \nual described in subclause (I) is  eligible for deferred ac-\ntion’”); Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Ter-\nrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, §423(b), 115 Stat. \n361 (“Such  spouse, child, son, or daughter may be eligible \nfor deferred action”); National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, §§1703(c)(1)(A), (2), 117 Stat. 1694–\n1695 (“Such spouse or child shall be eligible for deferred ac-\ntion”).6  Congress has failed to provide similar explicit pro-\nvisions for DACA recipients, and the immigration laws con-\ntain no indication that DHS can, at will, create its own \ncategorical policies for deferred action. \n  Other provisions pertaining to relief from removal fur-\nther demonstrate that DHS lacked the delegated authority  \n—————— \n6In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action pro-\n \ngrams have been implemented by the Executive Branch without explicit \nlegislation.  But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive]  \n \npower.’ ” Medellín v.  Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 532 (2008) (quoting  Dames & \n \nMoore v.  Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981)).  If any of these programs had \nbeen challenged, it would seem that they would be legally infirm for the  \nsame reasons as DACA.  Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create \nnew categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ \ndeferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise.   Duncan v.  \nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, \nand Congress is no closer to a legislative solution than it was in 2012.   \nSee, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H. R. 6, 116th Cong., \n1st Sess.  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nto create DACA.  As with lawful presence, Congress has \nprovided a plethora of methods by which aliens may seek \nrelief from removal.  For instance, both permanent and \ntemporary residents can seek cancellation of removal if  \nthey meet certain residency requirements and have not \ncommitted certain crimes.  §§1229b(a)–(b).  And certain \nnonpermanent residents may have their status adjusted to \npermanent  residence  during  these  proceedings.  \n§1229b(b)(2). Aliens can apply for asylum or withholding of \nremoval during removal proceedings unless they have com-\nmitted certain crimes.  §§1158, 1231(b)(3).  Applicants for \ncertain nonimmigrant visas may be granted a stay of re-\nmoval until the visa application is adjudicated.  §1227(d).  \nAnd, aliens may voluntarily depart rather than be subject\nto an order of removal. §1229c.\n  In sum, like lawful presence, Congress has provided for \nrelief from removal in specific and complex ways.  This nu-\nanced detail indicates that Congress has provided the full \npanoply of methods it thinks should be available for an al-\nien to seek relief from removal, leaving no discretion to DHS \nto provide additional programmatic forms of relief.7  \n3 \n  Finally, DHS could not appeal to general grants of au-\nthority, such as the Secretary’s ability to “perform such\nother acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his au-\nthority under the provisions of this chapter,” §1103(a)(3), or \nto “[e]stablis[h] national immigration enforcement policies\nand  priorities,”  6  U. S. C.  §202(5).    See  also  8  U. S. C.  \n§1103(g)(2).  Because we must interpret the statutes “as a \n—————— \n7It is uncontested that deferred action frequently occurs  on a case-by-\n \ncase basis, often justified on the grounds that the agency lacks resources  \nto remove all removable aliens.  Even assuming that these ad hoc exer-\ncises of discretion are permissible, however, we  have stated that “[a]n \nagency confronting resource  constraints may change its own conduct, but \nit cannot change the law.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.  EPA, 573 U. S.  \n302, 327 (2014). \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 561, 569 (1995), these grants of au-\nthority must be read alongside the express limits contained \nwithin the statute.  Basing the Secretary’s ability to com-\npletely overhaul immigration law on these general grants \nof  authority  would  eviscerate  that  deliberate  statutory \nscheme by “allow[ing the Secretary of DHS] to grant lawful  \npresence  . .  .  to  any  illegal  alien  in  the  United States.”  \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 184.  Not only is this “an untenable po-\nsition in light of the INA’s intricate system,” ibid., but it \nwould also render many of those provisions wholly super-\nfluous due to DHS’ authority to disregard them at will, \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  And in addi-\ntion to these fatal problems, adopting a broad interpreta-\ntion of these general grants of authority would run afoul of \nthe presumption that “Congress . . . does not alter the fun-\ndamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or \nancillary  provisions.”  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  \nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).  And it would also  \nconflict with the major questions doctrine, which is based \non the expectation that  Congress speaks clearly when it del-\negates the power to make “decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, \n573  U. S.  302,  324  (2014)  (UARG)  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted); see also  Texas, 787 F. 3d, at 760–761. \n  Read together, the detailed statutory provisions govern-\ning temporary and lawful permanent resident status, relief \nfrom removal, and classwide deferred-action programs lead\nineluctably to the conclusion that DACA is “inconsisten[t] \nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.”  \nUniversity of Tex.

United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 654 (SD Tex.  \n2015). The immigration statutes contain a level of granular \nspecificity that is exceedingly rare in the modern adminis-\ntrative state.  It defies all logic and common sense to con-\nclude that a statutory scheme detailed enough to provide \nconditional lawful presence to groups as narrowly defined\nas “alien entrepreneurs,” §1186b, is simultaneously capa-\ncious enough for DHS to grant lawful presence to almost \ntwo million  illegal aliens with the stroke of a Cabinet secre-\ntary’s pen. \nB \n  Then-Attorney General Sessions concluded that the ini-\ntial DACA program suffered from the “same legal . . . de-\nfects” as DAPA and expanded DACA, finding that, like \nthose programs, DACA was implemented without statutory\nauthority. App. 877–878. Not only was this determination \ncorrect, but it is also dispositive for purposes of our review.  \n“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power . . .  \nis limited to the authority granted by Congress.”  Bowen v.  \nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988).  DHS \nhad no authority here to create DACA, and the unlawful-\nness of that program is a sufficient justification for its re-\nscission.  \n  The majority opts for a different path, all but ignoring \nDACA’s substantive legal defect.  See ante, at 18–19.  On \nthe majority’s understanding of APA review, DHS was re-\nquired to provide additional policy justifications in order to \nrescind an action that it had no authority to take.  This rule \n“has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for [it] is \nconspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.”  Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 536 (2007) (ROBERTS, C.

No court can compel Executive Branch officials to ex-\nceed their congressionally delegated powers by continuing \na program that was void ab initio. Cf. Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U. S. 417 (1998); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919  \n(1983); see also EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., \n572 U. S. 489, 542, n. 5 (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Public \nCitizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 487 (1989) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  In reviewing agency\naction, our role is to ensure that Executive Branch officials  \ndo not transgress the proper bounds of their authority, Ar-\nlington, 569 U. S., at 327 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), not \nto perpetuate a decision to unlawfully wield power in direct \ncontravention  of  the enabling  statute’s  clear  limits,  see \nUARG, 573 U. S., at 327–328; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n  Under our precedents, DHS can only exercise the author-\nity that Congress has chosen to delegate to it.  See UARG, \n573 U. S., at 327.  In implementing DACA, DHS under the \nObama administration arrogated to itself power it was not \ngiven by Congress. Thus, every action taken by DHS under \nDACA is the unlawful exercise of power.  Now, under the  \nTrump administration, DHS has provided the most compel-\nling reason to rescind DACA: The program was unlawful \nand would force DHS to continue acting unlawfully if it car-\nried the program forward.  \nIII  \n  The majority’s demanding review of DHS’ decisionmak-\ning process is especially perverse given that the 2012 mem-\norandum flouted the APA’s procedural requirements—the\nvery  requirements  designed  to  prevent  arbitrary  deci-\nsionmaking. Even if DHS were authorized to create DACA,  \nit could not do so without undertaking an administrative \nrulemaking.  The fact that DHS did not engage in this pro-\ncess likely provides an independent basis for rescinding \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

But at the very least, this procedural defect com-\npounds the absurdity of the majority’s position in these \ncases. \n  As described above, DACA fundamentally altered the im-\nmigration laws. It created a new category of aliens who, as \na class, became exempt from statutory removal procedures, \nand it gave those aliens temporary lawful presence.  Both \nchanges contravened statutory limits.  DACA is thus what  \nis commonly called a substantive or legislative rule.8  As the  \nname implies, our precedents state that legislative rules \nare those that “have the force and effect of law.”  Chrysler  \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Our  precedents  allow  the  vast  majority  of  legislative \nrules to proceed through so-called “informal” notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  See United States v. Florida East \nCoast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973).9 But under our \nprecedents, an agency must engage in certain procedures \nmandated by the APA before its rule carries legal force.  Ki-\nsor v. Wilkie, 588 U.

These procedures specify that the \nagency “shall” publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in  \n—————— \n8The majority  tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must.  See ante, at \n \n11–12.  Otherwise, the majority would have to accept that DACA was \nnothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make \nits rescission  unreviewable.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831  \n(1985). \n9As I have previously pointed out, “the APA actually contemplated a  \n \nmuch more formal process  for most rulemaking.”   Perez v. Mortgage  \nBankers Assn., 575 U.

As we have recognized\nrecently, use of the word “shall” indicates that these proce-\ndures impose mandatory obligations on the agency before it \ncan adopt a valid binding regulation.  See Maine Commu-\nnity Health Options v.  United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___  \n(2020) (slip op., at 12).  After undergoing notice and com-\nment, the agency then publishes the final rule, which must \n“articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the] action in-\ncluding a rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United  \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463  \nU.

(slip op., at 17).10  \n  Because DACA has the force and effect of law, DHS was  \nrequired to observe the procedures set out in the APA if it \nwanted to promulgate a legislative rule.  It is undisputed, \nhowever, that DHS did not do so.  It provided no oppor-\ntunity for interested parties to submit comments regarding \nthe effect that the program’s dramatic and very significant \nchange in immigration law would have on various aspects \nof society.  It provided no discussion of economic considera-\ntions or national security interests.  Nor did it provide any \nsubstantial policy justifications for treating young people \n—————— \n10The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment \n \nrulemaking.  For example, an agency may promulgate a legally binding \nrule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so.  5 U.  S. C.  \n§553(b)(B).  This text would become a nullity if the agency  could achieve \nthe same effect by simply dispensing with notice and comment proce-\ndures altogether. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

And, it did not invoke any law authorizing  \nDHS to create such a program beyond its inexplicable as-\nsertion that DACA  was consistent with existing law.  Be-\ncause DHS failed to engage in the statutorily mandated\nprocess, DACA never gained status as a legally binding reg-\nulation that could impose duties or obligations on third par-\nties.  See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 23);  id., \nat ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17).\n  Given this state of affairs, it is unclear to me why DHS \nneeded to provide any explanation whatsoever when it de-\ncided to rescind DACA.  Nothing in the APA suggests that \nDHS was required to spill any ink justifying the rescission\nof an invalid legislative rule, let alone that it was required \nto provide policy justifications beyond acknowledging that \nthe program was simply unlawful from the beginning.  And,  \nit is well established that we do not remand for an agency \nto correct its reasoning when it was required by law to take \nor abstain from an action.  See Morgan Stanley Capital \nGroup Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 \nU. S. 527, 544–545 (2008).  Here, remand would be futile,  \nbecause no amount of policy explanation could cure the fact \nthat DHS lacked statutory authority to enact DACA in the \nfirst place.\n  Instead of recognizing this, the majority now requires the \nrescinding Department to treat the invalid rule as though \nit were legitimate.  As just explained, such a requirement \nis not supported by the APA.11  It is also absurd, as evi-\ndenced by its application to DACA in these cases.  The ma-\njority insists that DHS was obligated to discuss its choices \nregarding benefits and forbearance in great detail, even \n—————— \n11Thus, it is not  that the APA “should  not” be construed to support the \n \nmajority’s result, ante, at 26 (emphasis added), it is that the APA does  \nnot and cannot support that result. \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nthough no such detailed discussion accompanied DACA’s is-\nsuance. And, the majority also requires DHS to discuss re-\nliance interests at length, even though deferred action tra-\nditionally does not take reliance interests into account and \nDHS was not forced to explain its treatment of reliance in-\nterests in the first instance by going through notice and \ncomment.  See infra, at 23–24.  The majority’s demand for\nsuch an explanation here simply makes little sense. \n  At bottom, of course, none of this matters, because DHS  \ndid provide a sufficient explanation for its action.  DHS’ \nstatement that DACA was ultra vires  was more than suffi-\ncient to justify its rescission.12  By requiring more, the ma-\njority has distorted the APA review process beyond recogni-\ntion,  further  burdening  all  future  attempts  to  rescind \nunlawful programs.  Plaintiffs frequently bring successful \nchallenges to agency actions by arguing that the agency has \nimpermissibly dressed up a legislative rule as a policy state-\nment and must comply with the relevant procedures before \nfunctionally binding regulated parties.  See, e.g., Mendoza  \nv. Perez, 754 F. 3d 1002 (CADC 2014); Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 643 F. 3d 311 (CADC 2011); Na-\ntional Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn., Inc.  \nv. Sullivan, 979 F. 2d 227 (CADC 1992).  But going forward, \nwhen a rescinding agency inherits an invalid legislative\nrule that ignored virtually every rulemaking requirement \nof the APA, it will be obliged to overlook that reality.  In-\nstead of simply terminating the program because it did not \ngo through the requisite process, the agency will be com-\npelled to treat an invalid legislative rule as though it were \nlegitimate.13  \n—————— \n12I express no view on what other reasons would justify  an agency’s  \n \ndecision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action.  I merely point out \nthat correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n13In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immi-\n \ngration laws and had complied with the APA, it would still violate the \nConstitution as an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  See  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

The majority, therefore, claims that, notwith-\nstanding  the  then-Attorney  General’s  legal  conclusion, \nthen-Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider re-\nvoking  DACA  recipients’  lawful  presence  and  other  at-\ntendant benefits while continuing to defer their removal.  \nAnte, at 22–23. Even assuming the majority correctly char-\nacterizes the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, it cites no authority for \nthe proposition that arbitrary and capricious review re-\nquires an agency to dissect an unlawful program piece by \npiece,  scrutinizing  each  separate  element  to  determine \nwhether it would independently violate the law, rather \nthan just to rescind the entire program.14  \n—————— \nDepartment of Transportation v.  Association of American Railroads, 575  \nU. S. 43, 77 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).  Putting aside \nthis constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment process at \nleast attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some \nof the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rule-\nmaking process.  Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51  \nAdmin. L. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n14The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly \n \nquestionable.  Because a grant of deferred action renders DACA recipi-\nents eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from \nclear that the Department could separate  DACA’s “forbearance compo-\nnent” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet an-\nother APA problem.  The majority points to the fact that, under the Pa-\ntient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, relevant regulations \nexclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage.  \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  The then-Attorney General reviewed the thorough deci-\nsions of the District Court and the Fifth Circuit.  Those \ncourts exhaustively examined the INA’s text and structure, \nthe relevant provisions of other federal immigration stat-\nutes, the historical practice of deferred action, and the gen-\neral grants of statutory authority to set immigration policy.  \nBoth decisions concluded that  DAPA and expanded DACA \nviolated the carefully crafted federal immigration scheme, \nthat such violations could not be justified through reference \nto past exercises of deferred action, and that the general \ngrants of statutory authority did not give DHS the power to \nenact such a sweeping nonenforcement program. Based on  \nthe reasoning of those decisions, then-Attorney General \nSessions concluded that DACA was likewise implemented \nwithout statutory authority.  He directed DHS to restore \nthe rule of law.  DHS followed the then-Attorney General’s \nlegal analysis and rescinded the program.  This legal con-\nclusion more than suffices to supply the “reasoned analysis” \nnecessary to rescind an unlawful program. State Farm, 463  \nU. S., at 42.  \n  The majority has no answer except to suggest that this \napproach is inconsistent with  State Farm.  See ante, at 21– \n22.  But in doing so, the majority ignores the fact that, un-\nlike the typical “prior policy” contemplated by the Court in  \n—————— \nAnte, at 19, n. 5.  But that misses the point.  Those regulations were \npromulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the DACA pro-\ncess applie[d]” for those benefits.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012).  By \ncontrast, DACA recipients have been eligible for and have received Med-\nicare, Social Security, and work authorization for  years.  DHS therefore \nis not writing on a blank slate.  Under the majority’s rule, DHS would  \nneed to amend all relevant regulations and explain why all recipients of\ndeferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer \nreceive them.  Alternatively and perhaps  more problematically, it would \nneed to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred action should  \ncontinue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not.  It thus seems  \nhighly likely that the majority’s proposed course of action would be sub-\nject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nState Farm, DACA is unlawful.  Neither State Farm nor \nany other decision cited by the majority addresses what an \nagency must do when it has inherited an unlawful program.  \nIt is perhaps for this reason that, rather than responding \nwith authority of its own, the majority simply opts to excise \nthe “unlawful policy” aspect from its discussion. \nB \n  Second, the majority claims that DHS erred by failing to \ntake into account the reliance interests of DACA recipients.   \nAnte, at 23–26.  But reliance interests are irrelevant when  \nassessing whether to rescind an action that the agency \nlacked statutory authority to take.  No amount of reliance \ncould ever justify continuing a program that allows DHS to \nwield power that neither Congress nor the Constitution \ngave it. Any such decision would be “not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U. S. C. \n§§706(2)(A), (C). Accordingly, DHS would simply be engag-\ning in yet another exercise of unlawful power if it used reli-\nance interests to justify continuing the initially unlawful \nprogram, and a court would be obligated to set aside that \naction.15  \n  Even if reliance interests were sometimes relevant when \nrescinding an ultra vires action, the rescission still would \nnot be arbitrary and capricious here.  Rather, as the major-\nity does not dispute, the rescission is consistent with how\ndeferred action has always worked.  As a general matter, \ndeferred action creates no rights—it exists at the Govern-\nment’s discretion and can be revoked at any time.  See App.  \n—————— \n15The majority contends that this argument does not carry force be-\n \ncause the rescission implemented a winddown period during which re-\ncipients would continue to receive benefits.  But whether DHS’ decision \nto wind down DACA was lawful is a separate question from whether \nDHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing an \nunlawful program. \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The Government has made clear time \nand again that, because “deferred action is not an immigra-\ntion status, no alien has the right to deferred action.  It is  \nused solely in the discretion of the [Government] and con-\nfers no protection or benefit upon an alien.” DHS Immigra-\ntion and Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Re-\nmoval, Detention and Deportation Officers’ Field Manual \n§20.8 (Mar. 27, 2006); see also Memorandum from D.

Thus, con-\ntrary to the majority’s unsupported assertion,  ante, at 23,  \nthis longstanding administrative treatment of deferred ac-\ntion provides strong evidence and authority for the proposi-\ntion that an agency need not consider reliance interests in\nthis context.16  \n  Finally, it is inconceivable to require DHS to study reli-\nance interests before rescinding DACA considering how the \nprogram was previously defended.  DHS has made clear \nsince DACA’s inception that it would not consider such re-\nliance interests.  Contemporaneous with the DACA memo, \nDHS stated that “DHS can terminate or renew deferred ac-\ntion at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  Consideration  \n—————— \n16The majority’s  approach will make it far  more difficult to change \n \ndeferred-action programs going forward, which is hardly in keeping with \nthis Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in  \nadministrative discretion” used for administrative “convenience.”  Reno  \nv.

In fact,  \nDHS repeatedly argued in court that the 2014 memoran-\ndum was a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion in part \nbecause deferred action created no rights on which recipi-\nents could rely.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of ALITO,  J. \nnow  plays  in  our  constitutional system  should  consider\nwhat has happened in these cases.  Early in the term of the\ncurrent President, his administration took the controver-\nsial step of attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Shortly thereafter, \none of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked \nthis rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in \nlitigation.  In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed \npetitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not \nresolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells \nthe Department of Homeland Security to go back and try \nagain. What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, with-\nout holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented \nthat from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  \nOur constitutional system is not supposed to work that way. \n  I join JUSTICE THOMAS’s opinion.   DACA presents a deli-\ncate political issue, but that is not our business. As JUSTICE \nTHOMAS explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and \nthat alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even  \nif DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for over-\nturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA repre-\nsented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its re-\nscission represented an exercise of that same discretion, \nand it would therefore be unreviewable under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the ex-\ntent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and \ncapricious for essentially the reasons explained by JUSTICE \nKAVANAUGH.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \n  For the last 20 years, the country has engaged in conse-\nquential policy, religious, and moral debates about the legal \nstatus of millions of young immigrants who, as children, \nwere brought to the United States and have lived here ever \nsince.  Those young immigrants do not have legal status in \nthe United States under current statutory law.  They live, \ngo to school, and work here with uncertainty about their \nfutures.  Despite many attempts over the last two decades, \nCongress has not yet enacted legislation to afford legal sta-\ntus to those immigrants. \n  In 2012, exercising its view of the Executive’s prosecuto-\nrial discretion under Article II and the immigration laws, \nPresident Obama’s administration unilaterally instituted a \nprogram known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nor DACA.  Under DACA, eligible young immigrants may \napply for and receive deferred action.  They must renew \ntheir DACA status every two years.  Under the program, \nthe Executive Branch broadly forbears from enforcing cer-\ntain immigration removal laws against DACA recipients.  \nAnd by virtue of the forbearance, DACA recipients also be-\ncome eligible for work authorization and other benefits. \n  Since  2017,  President  Trump’s  administration  has \nsought to rescind DACA based on its different and narrower \nunderstanding of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion \nunder Article II and the immigration laws.  In its view, the \nExecutive Branch legally may not, and as a policy matter \nshould not, unilaterally forbear from enforcing the immi-\ngration laws against such a large class of individuals.  The \ncurrent administration has stated that it instead wants to \nwork with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that \nwould address the legal status of those immigrants together \nwith other significant immigration issues. \n  The question before the Court is whether the Executive \nBranch acted lawfully in ordering rescission of the ongoing \nDACA program.  To begin with, all nine Members of the \nCourt accept, as do the DACA plaintiffs themselves, that \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nthe Executive Branch possesses the legal authority to re-\nscind DACA and to resume pre-DACA enforcement of the \nimmigration laws enacted by Congress.  Having previously \nadopted a policy of prosecutorial discretion and nonenforce-\nment with respect to a particular class of offenses or indi-\nviduals, the Executive Branch has the legal authority to re-\nscind such a policy and resume enforcing the law enacted \nby Congress.  The Executive Branch’s exercise of that re-\nscission authority is subject to constitutional constraints \nand may also be subject to statutory constraints.  The nar-\nrow legal dispute here concerns a statutory constraint—\nnamely, whether the Executive Branch’s action to rescind \nDACA satisfied the general arbitrary-and-capricious stand-\nard of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. \n  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  \nAs the Court has long stated, judicial review under that \nstandard is deferential to the agency.  The Court may not \nsubstitute its policy judgment for that of the agency.  The \nCourt simply ensures that the agency has acted within a \nbroad zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reason-\nably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  ex-\nplained the decision.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U. S. 502 (2009); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29 (1983). \n  The Executive Branch explained its decision to rescind \nDACA in two sequential memorandums by successive Sec-\nretaries of Homeland Security: the 2017 Duke Memoran-\ndum and the 2018 Nielsen Memorandum.  The Duke Mem-\norandum focused on DACA’s perceived legal flaws.  The \nCourt today finds the Duke Memorandum insufficient un-\nder the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  But regardless of whether the Court is correct about the \nDuke Memorandum, the Nielsen Memorandum more fully \nexplained the Department’s legal reasons for rescinding \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA, and clarified that even if DACA were lawful, the De-\npartment would still rescind DACA for a variety of policy \nreasons.    The  Nielsen  Memorandum  also  expressly  ad-\ndressed the reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nquestion under the APA’s deferential arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious standard is not whether we agree with the Depart-\nment’s decision to rescind DACA.  The question is whether \nthe Nielsen Memorandum reasonably explained the deci-\nsion to rescind DACA.  Under ordinary application of the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memoran-\ndum—with its alternative and independent rationales and \nits discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an expla-\nnation for the Executive Branch’s action. \n  The Nielsen Memorandum was issued nine months after \nthe Duke Memorandum.  Under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, the Nielsen Memorandum is itself a “rule” setting \nforth “an agency statement of general . . . applicability and \nfuture effect designed to implement . . . policy.”  5 U. S. C. \n§551(4).  Because it is a rule, the Nielsen Memorandum con-\nstitutes “agency action.”  §551(13).  As the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Nielsen had the authority to \ndecide whether to stick with Secretary Duke’s decision to \nrescind DACA, or to make a different decision.  Like Secre-\ntary Duke, Secretary Nielsen chose to rescind DACA, and \nshe provided additional explanation.  Her memorandum \nwas akin to common forms of agency action that follow ear-\nlier agency action on the same subject—for example, a sup-\nplemental or new agency statement of policy, or an agency \norder with respect to a motion for rehearing or reconsider-\nation.  Courts often consider an agency’s additional expla-\nnations of policy or additional explanations made, for exam-\nple, on agency rehearing or reconsideration, or on remand \nfrom a court, even if the agency’s bottom-line decision itself \ndoes not change. \n  Yet the Court today jettisons the Nielsen Memorandum \nby classifying it as a post hoc justification for rescinding \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA.  Ante, at 14–16.  Under our precedents, however, the \npost hoc justification doctrine merely requires that courts \nassess agency action based on the official explanations of \nthe agency decisionmakers, and not based on after-the-fact \nexplanations advanced by agency lawyers during litigation \n(or  by  judges).   See,  e.g.,  State  Farm, 463 U. S., at  50 \n(“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc ration-\nalizations for agency action”); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. \n380, 397 (1974) (same); NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n380 U. S. 438, 443–444 (1965) (same); Burlington Truck \nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) \n(same).  As the D. C. Circuit has explained, the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine “is not a time barrier which freezes an \nagency’s exercise of its judgment after an initial decision \nhas been made and bars it from further articulation of its \nreasoning.  It is a rule directed at reviewing courts which \nforbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of ra-\ntionales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  deci-\nsionmakers.”  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 6 \n(2006) (Garland, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Indeed, the ordinary judicial remedy for an agency’s in-\nsufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation \nby the relevant agency personnel.  It would make little \nsense for a court to exclude official explanations by agency \npersonnel such as a Cabinet Secretary simply because the \nexplanations are purportedly post hoc, and then to turn \naround and remand for further explanation by those same \nagency personnel.  Yet that is the upshot of the Court’s ap-\nplication of the post hoc justification doctrine today.  The \nCourt’s refusal to look at the Nielsen Memorandum seems \nparticularly  mistaken,  moreover,  because  the  Nielsen \nMemorandum shows that the Department, back in 2018, \nconsidered the policy issues that the Court today says the \nDepartment did not consider.  Ante, at 20–26. \n  To be sure, cases such as Overton Park and Camp v. Pitts \nsuggest that courts reviewing certain agency adjudications \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nmay in some circumstances decline to examine an after-the-\nfact agency explanation.  See Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, \n142–143 (1973) (per curiam); Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 419–421 (1971).  But \nagency adjudications are “concerned with the determina-\ntion of past and present rights and liabilities,” Attorney \nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 14 \n(1947), and implicate the due process interests of the indi-\nvidual parties to the adjudication.  Judicial review of an ad-\njudication therefore ordinarily focuses on what happened \nduring the agency’s adjudication process of deciding that in-\ndividual case. \n  Even if certain agency adjudications have a slightly more \nstringent restriction on post hoc explanations, the APA is \n“based upon a dichotomy between rule making and adjudi-\ncation,” ibid., and this case involves an ongoing agency rule \nthat has future effect—the rescission of DACA.  The Nielsen \nMemorandum implements and explains the rescission of \nDACA.  I am aware of no case from this Court, and the \nCourt today cites none, that has employed the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine to exclude an agency’s official explana-\ntion of an agency rule.  For purposes of arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious review, it does not matter whether the latest official \nexplanation was two years ago or three years ago.  What \nmatters is whether the explanation was reasonable and fol-\nlowed the requisite procedures.  In my view, the Court \nshould  consider  the  Nielsen  Memorandum  in  deciding \nwhether the Department’s rescission of DACA satisfies the \nAPA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  Because the Court excludes the Nielsen Memorandum, \nthe Court sends the case back to the Department of Home-\nland Security for further explanation.  Although I disagree \nwith the Court’s decision to remand, the only practical con-\nsequence of the Court’s decision to remand appears to be \nsome delay.  The Court’s decision seems to allow the De-\npartment on remand to relabel and reiterate the substance \n\n  Cite as: 591 U.

Ante, at 23–26.*\n*    *    * \n  The Court’s resolution of this narrow APA issue of course \ncannot eliminate the broader uncertainty over the status of \nthe DACA recipients.  That uncertainty is a result of Con-\ngress’s inability thus far to agree on legislation, which in \nturn has forced successive administrations to improvise, \nthereby triggering many rounds of relentless litigation with \nthe prospect of more litigation to come.  In contrast to those \nnecessarily  short-lived  and  stopgap  administrative \nmeasures, the Article I legislative process could produce a \nsturdy and enduring solution to this issue, one way or the \nother, and thereby remove the uncertainty that has per-\nsisted for years for these young immigrants and the Na-\n—————— \n*Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s ar-\n \nbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not consider whether its prose-\ncutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” \nand therefore not subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the \nfirst place.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  Several judges have advanced argu-\nments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an \nexercise of forbearance authority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions \nabout whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial discretion \nagainst a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable \nunder the APA as “committed to agency discretion by law.”  Ibid.; see \nCasa De Maryland v.

CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \n1.  In September 2017, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity  (DHS)  determined,  in  accordance  with  the \nviews of the Attorney General, that the non-enforcement \npolicy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA) was likely unlawful and should be wound down \nin an orderly fashion.  Such a quintessential exercise of \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security’s authority to es-\ntablish “national immigration enforcement policies and \npriorities,” 6 U.S.C. 202(5) (2012 & Supp. V 2017), is not \njudicially reviewable and was eminently reasonable in \nany event.  See Pet. 17-31, United States DHS v. Re-\ngents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 18-587 (Nov. 5, 2018); Re-\nply Br. 6-11, Regents, supra (No. 18-587).  Yet DHS has \nbeen compelled by two nationwide preliminary injunc-\ntions to retain the unlawful policy and thereby sanction \nthe continuing violation of federal immigration law by \nnearly 700,000 aliens. \n(1) \n\n2 \nLast February, this Court declined to review the \nfirst of those injunctions before the court of appeals \ncould pass on its validity.  See DHS v. Regents of the \nUniv. of Cal., 138 S. Ct. 1182 (2018) (No. 17-1003).  The \nCourt  made  clear  its  expectation,  however,  that  the \ncourt of appeals “w[ould] proceed expeditiously to de-\ncide th[e] case,” at which time the government could re-\nnew its request.  Id. at 1182.  More than ten months \nlater, the court of appeals’ judgment is here and the \nCourt  is  presented  the  opportunity  it  anticipated  in \nFebruary.  For the reasons stated in the government’s \nreply brief filed today in Regents, supra (No. 18-587), \nthe Court should now grant the government’s Regents \npetition, and resolve this important dispute this Term. \n2.  In addition to granting certiorari in Regents, the \nCourt should also grant certiorari before judgment in \nthis case.  Such an order would be consistent with this \nCourt’s past practices in similar circumstances.  And it \nwould ensure that the Court both receives a comprehen-\nsive presentation of the relevant issues and has an ade-\nquate vehicle for the timely and definitive resolution of \nthis dispute.  See Pet. 16-17; Supp. Br. 11, Regents, su-\npra (No. 18-587).  Respondents’ arguments to the con-\ntrary are unpersuasive.   \na.  Respondents argue at length (Br. in Opp. 13) that \nthis case “does not involve exigent circumstances” that \nwould justify granting certiorari before judgment.  But \nthat is not the right standard.  When the government \nfiled its petitions in these cases, no court of appeals had \naddressed the questions presented.  The government \ntherefore explained that this dispute met the Court’s \nheightened standard for certiorari before judgment be-\ncause the issues here are of such “imperative public im-\nportance as to  * * *  require immediate determination \n \n\n3 \nin this Court.”  Sup. Ct. R. 11; see Pet. 14-15; Regents \nPet. 15-17.   By virtue of the Ninth Circuit’s intervening \njudgment,  however,  the  certiorari  decision  in  these \ncases is no longer governed by that standard—and thus \nthe bulk of respondent’s opposition is moot.   \nMost obviously, the certiorari decision in the Regents \ncases is now governed by the Court’s ordinary standard \nunder Rule 10.  As explained more fully in the briefing \nin those cases, further review is plainly warranted un-\nder the Rule 10 standard.  See Regents Reply Br. 1-11.  \nThe Ninth Circuit’s judgment, however, also affects the \nstandard  for  determining  whether  certiorari  before \njudgment is appropriate here.  As the government ex-\nplained  in  its  supplemental  briefing,  this  Court  has \ngranted certiorari before judgment “not only in cases of \ngreat public emergency but  also in situations  where \nsimilar or identical issues of importance were already \npending before the Court and where it was considered \ndesirable to review simultaneously the questions posed \nin  the  case  still  pending  in  the  court  of  appeals.”   \nStephen  M.  Shapiro  et  al.,  Supreme  Court  Practice  \n§ 2.4, at 86 (10th ed. 2013); see Regents Supp. Br. 11 \n(citing United States v. Fanfan, 542 U.S. 956 (2004) \n(No.  04-105)  (granting certiorari before  judgment in \ncompanion case to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 \n(2005) (No. 04-104)); Gratz v. Bollinger, 537 U.S. 1044 \n(2002) (No. 02-516) (granting certiorari before judgment \nin companion case to Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 \n(2003) (No. 02-241))). \nRespondents ignore  these precedents, but similar \nconsiderations strongly counsel in favor of granting the \ngovernment’s petition here.  Specifically, in granting \ncertiorari in this case alongside the Regents petition, \nthe Court would eliminate any argument that Secretary \n \n\n4 \nNielsen’s June 22 memorandum is not part of the record \nbefore this Court and would bring directly before the \nCourt the district court’s consideration of the impact of \nthat memorandum on the resolution of this dispute.  See \nPet. 15-17.  The Ninth Circuit’s refusal to undertake \nthat analysis and the Regents respondents’ refusal to \naddress the contents of the Nielsen memorandum in \ntheir briefs in opposition only underscores the wisdom \nof that approach. \nb. Contrary to respondents’ assertion (Br. in Opp. \n30-33), moreover, the entire Nielsen memorandum is \nrelevant to the Court’s consideration of the questions \npresented.  Respondents insist that the Court ignore \nthe bulk of that memorandum because they claim it was \nnot a “separate administrative action.”  Id. at 30 n.12; \ncf. Regents Indiv. Br. in Opp. 33 (arguing that the Niel-\nsen  memorandum is irrelevant because  it was  not  a \n“‘fresh agency action’ (a Rescission 2.0)”) (citation omit-\n \nted).  Respondents would apparently require DHS to \nreset this protracted litigation by issuing a “new” inde-\npendent agency decision on DACA before the current \nSecretary could offer any further explanation of the re-\nscission.  But where, as here, a court determines that an \nagency’s initial explanation is insufficient and requests \nfurther explanation, “it is incumbent upon the court to \nconsider that explanation when it arrives.”  Alpharma, \nInc. v. Leavitt, 460 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  That is par-\nticularly appropriate here, given that every court to have \naddressed the question has agreed that the rescission did \nnot require notice-and-comment rulemaking and there-\nfore the Nielsen memorandum itself satisfies the proce-\ndural requirements for a new agency action in any event.   \nTo be sure, unlike the respondents in Regents, re-\nspondents here now concede (Br. in Opp. 32) that the \n \n\n5 \nCourt can and should consider certain aspects of the \nNielsen memorandum.  They nevertheless contend that \nonly “amplifi[cations]” of previously offered rationales \nmay be considered after remand, not “new reason[s] for \nwhy the agency could have taken the action”—which \nthey argue means that only Secretary Nielsen’s “legal \nanalysis may be considered.”  Id. at 31-32 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  On a remand for in-\nsufficient explanation, however, an agency is free to en-\ngage in and offer to the reviewing court “additional in-\nvestigation  or  explanation”  for  its  action.    Florida \nPower & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985) \n(emphasis added).   \nCamp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138 (1973) (per curiam), is \nnot to the contrary.  In the passage on which respond-\nents rely, the Court discussed the appropriate scope of \n“affidavits or testimony” that could be offered directly \nto the reviewing court to allow it to properly assess \nagency action.  Id. at 143.  The Court placed no limita-\ntions on the explanation an agency might offer if the \ncourt found that the reasons offered at the time of the \ndecision  were  insufficient  and  the  decision  was  re-\nmanded to the agency for further consideration.  Ibid.  \nAnd the Court’s ambiguous dicta in Pension Benefit \nGuaranty  Corp.  v.  LTV  Corp.,  496  U.S.  633  (1990), \nabout the scope of any remand is similarly inapposite.  \nSee id. at 654 (noting that, where an agency’s initial ex-\nplanation is insufficient, “the preferred course” “‘except \n \nin rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for \nadditional investigation or explanation’”) (quoting Flor-\n \nida Power & Light Co., 470 U.S. at 744). \nThe rule against post hoc rationalizations generally \n“forbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of \nrationales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  \n \n\n6 \ndecisionmakers.”  Alpharma, 460 F.3d at 6.  It “applies \nto rationalizations offered for the first time in litigation \naffidavits and arguments of counsel.”  Ibid.  An official \nmemorandum offered by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity  explaining  why  DHS’s  decision  to  rescind \nDACA “was, and remains, sound,” Regents Pet. App. \n121a, is neither.  For that reason, the Court should \ngrant the government’s petition in this case alongside \nthe Regents petition to eliminate any argument that it \nmay not consider the implications of Secretary Niel-\nsen’s memorandum on the resolution of this dispute.  \n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the pe-\ntition, the petition for a writ of certiorari before judg-\nment should be granted and the case consolidated with \nUnited States DHS v. Regents of the University of Cal-\nifornia, No. 18-587 (filed Nov. 5, 2018), for the Court’s \nconsideration this Term. \nRespectfully submitted. \n  NOEL J.

Each declarant is a member of either the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People (“NAACP”), American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO ( “AFT”) or the \nUnited  Food  and  Commercial  Workers  International  Union,  AFL-CIO,  CLC  (“UFCW”) \n(collectively, the “Association  Plaintiffs”) who seeks to  submit a declaration in  support of \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Preliminary Injunction.  Defendants do not \noppose the Association Plaintiffs’ request to file the declarations via pseudonym, but take the \nposition that Defendants should be entitled to know the declarants’ identities.  The Association \nPlaintiffs oppose disclosing their identities to Defendants for the reasons set forth below. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  Association Plaintiffs brought suit to challenge Defendants’ September 5, 2017 rescission \nof  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrival  Program  (DACA)  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act (APA), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the U.S. Constitution.  Pursuant to the \nCourt’s November 22, 2017 Scheduling Order (Dkt. 7), Association Plaintiffs will file a motion \nfor a preliminary injunction or for summary judgment on December 15, 2017.  In connection \nwith that motion, the Association Plaintiffs seeks to file declarations on behalf of nine declarants \nwho wish to withhold their identities from Defendants and the public (hereinafter, the “Doe \ndeclarants”).   \nThe  Doe  declarants  are  DACA  recipients  who  are  currently  members  of  either  the \nNAACP, the AFT, or the UFCW.  See Ex. 1-9 (Doe declarations).  Their declarations describe \nthe crucial role that DACA has played in the declarants’ lives and the consequences for them, \nand for the Association Plaintiffs stemming from DACA’s rescission.  The declarations generally \nrelate to the legal issues of standing, facts that Defendants failed to consider in deciding to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 3 of 19\n \nrescind DACA, the irreparable harm the declarants will suffer if DACA is rescinded, and the \npublic interest to be weighed in assessing Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief. \nThe Doe declarants currently have protections arising from their DACA status.  Barring \ninjunctive relief, however, they will be subject to arrest, detention, and removal by immigration \nauthorities once their DACA status expires. \nThe Government has “urge[d] DACA recipients to use the time remaining on their work \nauthorizations to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States.”1  Furthermore, \nthe  Government  possesses  the  Doe  declarants’  personal  information,  including  their  home \naddresses,  which was  collected  from  DACA applicants  as part of the application process.2  \nThough  it  promised  at  the  time  not  to  use  that  information  for  enforcement  purposes,  the \nGovernment has asserted its ability to revise that information-sharing policy without notice at \nany time.  Defs.’ Mem. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss the Association Plaintiffs at 38-39 (Dkt. \n15).  Thus, Defendants claim the right, and have the ability, to deport the Doe declarants and/or \ntheir family members.     \nThe Doe declarants reasonably fear retaliation for submitting declarations in support of \nthe Plaintiffs in this case.  Specifically:   \n  Declarant Jane Doe II was brought to the United States when she was two years old.  She \nis the first person in her family to attend college.  Receiving DACA protection has \nallowed her to go to college and become a special education teacher.  DACA’s rescission \n                                                 \n1 Talking Points - DACA Rescission, MSNBC, http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/ \nNEWS/z-pdf-archive/170905-DACA-Talking-Points.pdf; see also Kristen Welker & Daniel \nArkin, Trump Administration Memo: DACA Recipients Should Prepare for ‘Departure,’ NBC \nNEWS (Sept. 5, 2007), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-memo-\ndacarecipients-should-prepare-departure-n799026. \n2 See Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, USCIS Form I- \n821D at 13 (Jan. 9, 2017), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-821dinstr.pdf. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 4 of 19\n \nwould lead to a significant economic hardship for her, and for her students, as the District \nshe teaches in has a shortage of teachers qualified to teach deaf students.  Disclosure of \nher identity to the Government would cause her extreme mental stress; she is already \nexhausted from the fear and emotional turmoil of the uncertainty that now overwhelms \nher life.   \n  Declarant Jane Doe III was brought to the United States when she was only eight years \nold. Before DACA, she never thought she would be able to go to college, as she would \nhave  no  way  of  receiving  financial  aid.  After  graduating  high  school  as  the  class \nsalutatorian, she matriculated in the University of Texas, Austin. After graduating from \ncollege, Jane Doe III began teaching Spanish in a public high school, and also facilitates \na  program  designed  for  students  who  are  underrepresented  in  higher  education.  In \naddition  to  experiencing  feelings  of  shame,  fear,  and  not  belonging  since  Attorney \nGeneral Sessions announced the plan to end DACA on September 5, 2017, she is terrified \nthat she will be deported and torn from the only community and home she has ever \nknown. Disclosing her identity would compound that terror. \n  Declarant Jane Doe IV was brought to the United States when she was seven years old. \nShe grew up without being able to go to the doctor, because her parents were afraid that \nher status would be discovered. She was overjoyed when she was finally old enough to \nreceive DACA protection in 2014 and received employment authorization for the first \ntime. She now lives in constant fear of deportation to a country she does not know, and of \nbeing torn from her brother and sister, who are U.S. Citizens. Disclosing her identity \nwould cause her a tremendous amount of stress and anguish. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 5 of 19\n \n  Declarant Jane Doe V was brought to this country at age nine, and has a brother who was \nlater  born  here,  as  a  U.S.  Citizen.  She  excelled  in  school,  but  because  she  was \nundocumented, she could not obtain any academic scholarships so she could attend any \nof the elite institutions that tried to recruit her. She is currently a student at the City \nUniversity of New York (“CUNY”), and she wants to become a lawyer. She is now \nfearful that she will be separated from her little brother, and that she will be unable to \nfinish college or ever become a lawyer. She is also afraid of being deported to a country \nwhere she has no close family or friends and does not know the customs. Disclosing her \nidentity would increase the fearfulness she feels now by magnitudes of order. \n  Declarant Jane Doe VI was brought to the United States when she was four years old. \nShe has lived in fear since the age of eight, when she first learned she did not have \ndocuments. She describes living in fear of begin caught as undocumented while trying to \nattend school and get a job. Before DACA, she could see no future for herself, and often \nworked two part-time jobs without benefits to make ends meet. Because of DACA, she \nwas able to receive work authorization and a much better job, where she earns $15.20 per \nhour.  This  is  enough  for  her  to  provide  a  home  for  her  twin  children,  and  health \ninsurance, which she receives through her employer. Now that DACA is threatened, Jane \nDoe VI feels hopeless about her future goal of becoming a paralegal, and worried that she \nwill no longer be able to financially assist her parents. She is terrified, because her twins \nare only 19 months old, and they are American citizens. She does not know what will \nhappen if she is removed from the United States. Revealing her identity would add to her \ndeep feelings of fear and the stress she is currently experiencing.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 6 of 19\n \n  Declarant Jane Doe VII was brought to the United States when she was two years old; \nshe is now 21 years old. Her parents are also undocumented, and she recalls growing up \nin fear of being caught by immigration. Before DACA, she was only able to secure low \nwage positions where she earned only $6.00 per hour; she often needed to work two jobs \nto pay her bills. Because of DACA, she now has a job making $15.50 per hour, plus \nhealth insurance, vision and dental coverage, and personal time. She is afraid that if her \nprotections under DACA end, she will go back to having to work low level jobs, be \nunable to legally drive a car, and be unable to make ends meet. She most fears being \nremoved from the United States and returned to a country she does not know, where she \nhas no family and friends. Revealing her identity would intensify these fears.  \n  Declarant Jane Doe VIII was brought to the United States at the age of nine, and is a 24 \nyear old single mother with two children, age 5 and 7, who are citizens of the United \nStates. She did not learn she was undocumented until high school, when her parents told \nher why she could not take driver’s education or get a part time job, because I did not \nhave the proper papers. After graduating high school, she was paid $4.00 per hour to \nwork at a bakery, because the employer knew she was undocumented. She had no choice, \nbecause she was pregnant and had to support herself. Since 2013, she has been receiving \nDACA protection, and she began working at the same place she currently works, where \nshe earns $15.75 per hour, with insurance for her and her children and other employee \nbenefits. She is already very nervous and anxious about what is going to happen, and \nreports that the stress is negatively affecting her. This anxiety would be far worse if her \nidentity is revealed. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 7 of 19\n \n  Declarant Jane Doe IX was brought to the United States at age nine, and discovered she \nwas  undocumented  at  age  11,  when  she  wanted  to  go  to  boarding  school  but  was \ninformed  she  could  not  receive  financial  aid  without  a  social  security  card.  Before \nDACA, she worked minimum wage jobs earning $8.25 per hour.  She also attended \ncollege  after  high  school,  and  received  a  scholarship.  Once  she  became  a  DACA \nregistrant, she was able to get a better paying job, earning $12 per hour, and move into \nstudent housing on campus. She is studying to receive a psychology degree. She is afraid \nthat if her DACA protection is lost, she will no longer be able to finish school, live \nindependently from her parents, drive, plan for her future, or help her parents when they \nare  old.  Revealing  her  identity  would  compound  the  concerns  she  is  currently \nexperiencing.  \n  Declarant John Doe III was brought to the United States when he was seven years old.  \nHe was told by his high school guidance counselor that being undocumented meant he \nhad no real educational future, so he should either go to community college or work upon \ngraduation. He went to community college, and then after registering with DACA, was \nable to transfer into UCLA in 2013. He is currently a member of the Teach for America \nProgram and teaches 9th grade history in New York. He is very afraid that if his DACA \nis lost, he will have to leave his sister, who is a U.S. citizen and still in high school, that \nhe will not be able to help his aging parents, and that all of his hard work will be down \nthe drain. He also fears that his students will be detrimentally affected. Revealing his \nidentity will add to the enormous amount of stress he is experiencing.   \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 8 of 19\n \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Courts may exercise discretion to authorize the submission of materials by anonymous \nparties and declarants. Does I Through III v. District of Columbia, 216 F.R.D. 5, 6 n.1 (D.D.C. \n2003) (noting that plaintiffs were granted leave to file via pseudonym); Oah v. Tabor, No. 90-\n1023, 1991 WL 120087, at *1 n.1 (D.D.C. June 18, 1991) (same). Courts authorize parties to \nproceed without disclosing their identity to the public in cases involving “matters of a sensitive \nand highly personal nature,” exercising their discretion in balancing the circumstances of each \ncase with the tradition of openness in judicial proceedings.  Doe v. Cabrera, 307 F.R.D. 1, 4 \n(D.D.C. 2014).  Courts may also authorize parties to proceed without revealing their identities to \nthe defendants when there is a particularly high risk of retaliation or harassment balanced against \na low risk of prejudice to the defendants. See, e.g., Women Prisoners of the D.C. Dep’t of Corrs. \nv. District of Columbia, 877 F. Supp. 634, 639 n.1 (D.D.C. 1994) (allowing prisoners to proceed \nunder pseudonyms due to the risk of retaliation by prison guards), vacated and modified in part \non other grounds, 899 F. Supp. 659 (D.D.C. 1995); Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 515 F. \nSupp. 1239, 1246 (D.D.C. 1981) (allowing plaintiffs to  proceed anonymously  in  an  action \nchallenging the agency’s interpretation of the Food Stamp Act); Gomez v. Buckeye Sugars, 60 \nF.R.D. 106, 107 (N.D. Ohio 1973) (allowing plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms in a Fair \nLabor Standards Act because the plaintiffs feared retaliation from defendants who were their \nemployers;  Yaman v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 786 F. Supp. 2d 148 (D.D.C. 2011) (allowing plaintiff \nto file her residential address under seal and ex parte to protect safety of her minor children) \n  Although the District of Columbia Circuit has not articulated a precise test for whether to \nallow persons to proceed anonymously, courts have applied the following five factors:  \n(1) whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is \nmerely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend any \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 9 of 19\n \nlitigation or is to preserve privacy in a matter of a sensitive and \nhighly personal nature; \n(2) whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or \nmental harm to the requesting party or even more critically, to \ninnocent non-parties; \n(3) the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be \nprotected; \n(4) whether the action is against a governmental or private party; \nand \n(5) the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an \naction against it to proceed anonymously. \nNat’l Ass’n of Waterfront Emp’rs v. Chao, 587 F.Supp.2d 90, 99 (D.D.C. 2008); see also J.W. v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 318 F.R.D. 196, 198 (D.D.C. 2016) (applying the same factors to parents’ \nrequest for anonymity for themselves while bringing a suit on behalf of their minor child); Doe v. \nCabrera, 307 F.R.D. 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2014) (applying the same factors to a plaintiff alleging sexual \nassault). All of these factors are relevant in this case except for the one pertaining to the ages of \nthe declarants, who are all adults over the age of eighteen. The remaining factors militate heavily \nin favor of allowing each of the Doe declarants in this case to proceed via pseudonym.  \nARGUMENT \nThe declarations submitted by nine Doe declarants contain highly sensitive and personal \ninformation, and each declarant faces a significant risk of retaliatory harm.  Moreover, protecting \ntheir  identities  from  the  public  and  the  Government—from  whom  they  fear  retaliatory \nimmigration enforcement action—would not pose a risk of unfairness to Defendants.  The Doe \ndeclarants are not parties to this case, and the Government has no need to know their identities in \norder to brief the legal matters before the Court.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 10 of 19\n \nI.  Anonymity is Necessary to Protect Highly Sensitive and Personal Information.  \n \nThe Doe declarants should be allowed to proceed via pseudonym because immigration \nstatus is a highly sensitive and personal issue.   \nNumerous federal courts have recognized that information related to immigration status \nis highly sensitive and may warrant protection from disclosure.  See, e.g., Hispanic Interest Coal. \nof Ala. v. Governor of Ala., 691 F.3d 1236, 1247 & n.8 (11th Cir. 2012) (noting that revealing \nimmigration  status  of  school  children  could  lead  to  “criminal  prosecution,  harassment  and \nintimidation” and identifying cases in which courts allowed undocumented immigrant plaintiffs \nto proceed anonymously); Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1169 \n(9th Cir. 2000) (crediting plaintiffs’ “highly vulnerable [immigration] status” as one of several \nfactors weighing in favor of allowing plaintiffs to proceed anonymously); In re Reyes, 814 F.2d \n168, 170 (5th Cir. 1987) (stating in a protective order ruling that allowing defendant employers \nto seek discovery regarding plaintiffs’ immigration status could inhibit them from pursuing their \nrights  “because  of  possible  collateral  wholly  unrelated  consequences,  [and]  because  of \nembarrassment and inquiry into their private lives”); Oah v. Tabor, 1991 WL 120087, at *1 n.1 \n(allowing an immigrant plaintiff to proceed anonymously). \nThe sensitivity of information relating to immigration status is further heightened when \nthe action is against a governmental entity, which could use the information to arrest, detain, or \neven  deport  undocumented  immigrants  involved  in  the  lawsuit  (in  case  of  the  federal \ngovernment) or facilitate those actions by the federal government (in cases of state or local \ngovernmental entities).  For that reason, courts are especially inclined to shield the identity of \nimmigrants with uncertain or undocumented status challenging laws that implicate their status.  \nSee, e.g., Lozano v. City of Hazelton, 620 F.3d 170, 195 (3d Cir. 2010), rev’d on other grounds, \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 11 of 19\n \n563 U.S. 1030 (2011) (mem.) (allowing plaintiffs to proceed without disclosing their identities to \nthe defendants, because plaintiffs “could legitimately fear that defendant [municipality] was \ndetermined to expose their legal status to federal authorities”), aff’d in relevant part, 620 F.3d \n170 (3d Cir. 2010), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 563 U.S. 1030 (2011); Puente Az. \nv. Arpaio, No. CV14-1356-PHX-DGC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166223, at *5 (D. Ariz. Dec. 1, \n2014) (allowing undocumented immigrants to file Doe declarations in a challenge against state \nstatutes criminalizing seeking employment without federal work authorization); Keller v. City of \nFremont,  No.  8:10-cv-270,  2011  WL  41902,  at  *1-*3  (D.  Neb.  Jan.  5,  2011)  (allowing \nundocumented immigrants to proceed anonymously as plaintiffs in a case challenging a ballot \ninitiative making it unlawful for any entity to knowingly or recklessly lease or rent property to \nundocumented  immigrants);  Order  Granting  Pltfs.’  Mot.  to  Proceed  Under  Pseudonyms, \nHispanic Interest Coal. of Ala. v. Governor of Ala., No. 5:11-cv-2736-SLB (N.D. Ala. Aug. 12, \n2011) (ECF No. 54) (allowing plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms and protecting their \nidentities from the state government defendant because the challenged statute would enable state \nofficials to detain undocumented immigrants on the basis of their immigration status).  “[F]ederal \ncourts have recognized that inquiries into immigration status can have an in terrorem effect, \nlimiting the willingness of plaintiffs to pursue their rights out of fears of the consequences of an \nexposure of their position.”  Keller, 2011 WL 41902, at *2. \nHere,  submitting  a  declaration  in  support  of  the  Plaintiffs’  challenge  against  the \nadministration  could  attract  unwanted  attention  to  the  Doe  declarants’  immigration  status.  \nMoreover, having the declarants’ names “in the public domain, especially in the Internet age,” \ncould subject the declarants to “unnecessary interrogation, criticism, or psychological trauma,” in \naddition to the significant risk of retaliation they face, as discussed below.  Cabrera, 307 F.R.D. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 12 of 19\n \nat 7 (allowing a plaintiff alleging sexual assault to proceed anonymously).  Given the risk of such \nscrutiny  and  harassment  as  recognized  by  numerous  courts,  disclosing  the  Doe  declarants’ \nimmigration status would lead to harm that is well beyond the “mere[] . . . annoyance and \ncriticism that may attend any litigation.”  J.W., 318 F.R.D. at 200 (internal quotation and citation \nomitted). \nII.  Disclosure of the Doe Declarants’ Identities Would Create a Significant Risk of \nPhysical and Psychological Harm to Themselves and Their Families. \n \nDisclosure of the Doe declarants’ identities would expose them to a heightened risk of \narrest, detention, and removal.  Since the rescission announcement on September 5, 2017, DACA \nrecipients  have  been  living  in  fear  that  they  are  no  longer  shielded  from  the  threat  of \ndeportation—a threat of being separated from their families, workplaces, and communities.   \nTheir fear is warranted.  First, DACA recipients are particularly vulnerable to retaliation \nbecause they have furnished personal identification information to the Government as part of \ntheir  DACA  application  process,  and  the  Government  has  stated  that  it  may  modify  its \ninformation-sharing policy at any moment, without any notice.  Mem. in Support of Defs.’ Mot. \nto Dismiss the Association Plaintiffs at 38-39 (Dkt. 15).  Second, the number of immigration-\nrelated arrests have increased by 40% in the fiscal year 2017.3  Third, the Government has \n“urge[d] DACA recipients to use the time remaining on their work authorizations to prepare for \nand arrange their departure from the United States”4; see also Batalla Vidal v. Duke, No. 16-cv-\n                                                 \n3  U.S.  Immigration  &  Customs  Enforcement,  DHS  Announces  Progress  in  Enforcing \nImmigration  Laws,  Protecting  Americans  (Dec.  5,  2017),  available  at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/dhs-announces-progress-enforcing-immigration-laws-\nprotecting-americans. \n4 Talking Points - DACA Rescission, MSNBC, http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/ \nNEWS/z-pdf-archive/170905-DACA-Talking-Points.pdf; Kristen Welker & Daniel \nArkin, Trump Administration Memo: DACA Recipients Should Prepare for ‘Departure,’ NBC \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 13 of 19\n \n4756, 2017 WL 5201116, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2017) (quoting a statement by Acting \nDirector of ICE Thomas Homan that undocumented immigrants “should be uncomfortable” and \n“should look over [their] shoulder[s]” and “be worried”).  When asked whether DACA recipients \nare subject to deportation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that “[w]e can’t promise people \nwho are here unlawfully that they’re not going to be deported.”5  Fourth, at least one DACA \nrecipient who had spoken out against the Trump Administration has been detained.6   \nIn this context, revealing the Doe declarants’ identities would put their well-being and \nsafety,  as  well  as  that  of  their  families,  at  risk,  because  it  would  entail  disclosing  their \nimmigration status to the very source of that retaliatory threat.7  See Lozano, 620 F.3d  at 195 \n(allowing plaintiffs to not reveal their identities to the defendant because plaintiffs would be \ndiscouraged from vindicating their rights “if doing so would require alerting federal immigration \nauthorities to their presence”); Int’l Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v.

This Action is Against the Government, Which Favors Anonymity. \n \nThe fact that this action is against the Government and not against a private party weighs \nin favor of allowing the Doe declarants to proceed via pseudonym. “[A]lthough the mere filing \nof a lawsuit against a private party may cause the defendant reputational and economic harm, \nsuch that fairness requires the identification of the plaintiffs, the government is not vulnerable to \nsimilar reputational harm, particularly in a case involving a challenge to the constitutional, \nstatutory, or regulatory validity of government activity.”  IRAP, 2017 WL 818255, at *3; see also \nJ.W., 318 F.R.D at 201 (“Courts have concluded that anonymous litigation is more acceptable \nwhen the defendant is a governmental body because government defendants do not share the \nconcerns about reputation that private individuals have when they are publicly charged with \nwrongdoing.” (internal quotation omitted)); S. Methodist Univ. Ass’n of Women Law Students v. \nWynne & Jaffe, 599 F.2d 707, 713 (5th Cir. 1979) (noting that, unlike anonymous lawsuits \nagainst private parties, suits “challenging the constitutional, statutory, or regulatory validity of \ngovernment activity . . . involve no injury to the Government’s reputation”). Because there is no \ndue process concern when the Government is the defendant, this factor weighs in Plaintiffs’ \nfavor. \nIV.  Any Risk of Unfairness to Defendants is Minimal and Outweighed by the Doe \nDeclarants’ Need for Anonymity.  \n \nAny risk of unfairness to Defendants is minimal and heavily outweighed by the Doe \ndeclarants’ need for anonymity. First, the Doe declarants are third parties. The tradition of public \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 15 of 19\n \naccess and open proceedings is implicated to a much lesser degree when involving third-party \ndeclarants, rather than parties to the case.  See Puente Az., No. CV14-1356 PHX DGC, No. 2016 \nWL 7743406, at *4 (D. Ariz. Jan. 22, 2016) (noting in a protective order ruling in favor of non-\nparty Doe declarants that “the public’s interest in an open and fair adjudication is not seriously \nimpaired” when plaintiffs are openly identified and the proceedings would be public); cf. J.W., \n318 F.R.D. at 201 (noting that courts are wary of permitting anonymous litigation when doing so \nwould pose “litigation obstacles for defendants”).  Here, the real parties-in-interest—Plaintiffs \nNAACP,  AFT,  and  UFCW—are  fully  identified,  so  that  allowing  non-party  declarants  to \nproceed via pseudonym would not seriously hinder the Government’s defense.   \nSecond, the issues in this case are primarily legal in nature and do not turn on individual \nDACA recipients’ background or credibility. In Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 515 F. Supp. \n1239 (D.D.C. 1981), a dispute over the proper interpretation of the Food Stamp Act, the court \nfound that because the issues in the case were primarily legal in nature, Jane Doe plaintiffs were \nnot required to divulge their identities to the defendants in seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief that would affect all social security disability recipients. Id. at 1246; see also Lozano, 620 \nF.3d at 195 (agreeing with the district court’s conclusion that “because the Doe Plaintiffs’ \nidentity information was not central to their claims, restricting [the defendant’s] access to that \ninformation  would  not  be  prejudicial”);  IRAP,  2017  WL  818255,  at  *3  (finding  that  “any \nprejudice  to  defendants”  in  a  case  with  anonymous  plaintiffs  is  “limited  because  the  Doe \nPlaintiffs are challenging the constitutional and statutory validity of a governmental order, such \nthat the questions presented in this case do not depend on identifying the specific parties but \ninstead are purely legal” (internal quotations and citations omitted)).    \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 16 of 19\n \nHere, the Doe declarants seek to provide the Court with information that contextualizes \nhow  DACA  and  its  rescission  have  affected  the  Association  Plaintiffs  and  their  members.  \nDefendants  make  primarily  legal  arguments  about  those  issues,  and  have  not  seriously \nchallenged the fact that DACA’s rescission will negatively impact DACA beneficiaries.  To the \ncontrary, Defendants now contend that they rescinded DACA in an “orderly” manner precisely \nto avoid the harm that would come from a more abrupt termination.  See Defs.’ Mem. in Support \nof Mot. to Dismiss the Association Plaintiffs at 1-2 (Dkt. 15). Because the Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst Defendants do not depend on the particularized facts and circumstances of the Doe \ndeclarants, but rather revolve around the question of the legality of Defendants’ decision to \nrescind  DACA,  the  risk  of  unfairness  from  allowing  the  Doe  declarants  to  proceed  via \npseudonym is minimal. \nThird, the parties’ agreed briefing schedule contemplates no discovery or presentation of \ntestimony at the motions hearing scheduled for January 31, 2018. Accordingly, Defendants have \nno present need for the identity of the Doe declarants.  Any assertion of future prejudice would \nbe wholly speculative. In the unlikely event that Defendants determine later in the litigation that \nthey have an actual need for the declarants’ identities, they could then make a motion attempting \nto demonstrate such need, at which time Plaintiffs could move for a Protective Order.8   \n                                                 \n8 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); see also Order Granting Mot. for Protective Order, Doe 1 v. Trump, \nNo. CV 17-1597 (D.D.C. Sept. 13, 2017) (ECF No. 38) (limiting disclosure of pseudonym \nplaintiffs’ identities to counsel for defendants and those in the employ of counsel for defendants \nin a suit challenging the presidential memorandum prohibiting accession of transgender military \nmembers); Alexander v. FBI, 186 F.R.D. 54 (D.D.C. 1998) (limiting disclosure of plaintiffs’ \nmedical information to counsel of record and not the defendant agency); Alexander v. Falk, No. \n16-cv-2268, 2017 WL 3749573 (D. Nev. Aug. 30, 2017) (ordering disclosure of plaintiffs’ \nidentity to defendants’ counsel only, with  a prohibition on disclosing plaintiffs’ identity to \ncounsel’s clients); see also D’Onofrio v. SFX Sports Grp., 256 F.R.D. 277, 280 (D.D.C. 2009) \n(“[T]here need not be a great deal of harm to justify protecting information when doing so would \nnot prejudice the party who will be prevented from seeing the information.”). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 18   Filed 12/15/17   Page 17 of 19\n \nCONCLUSION \n \n  The  relevant  factors  weigh  in  favor  of  allowing  the  Doe  declarants  to  proceed  via \npseudonym. The Doe declarants would suffer significant harm if their identities were revealed, \nand permitting them to proceed via pseudonym would not unfairly prejudice the Government.  \nThe Association Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that this Court permit the Doe declarants \nto proceed via pseudonym.   \nDecember 15, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n     \n   \n     /s/ Joseph M.

Civil Action No. 17-1907 (JDB) \nDONALD J. TRUMP, et al.,   \nDefendants. \n \nTRUSTEES OF PRINCETON \nUNIVERSITY, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Civil Action No. 17-2325 (JDB) \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.,   \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThese  cases  present  an  array  of  administrative  and  constitutional  challenges  to  the \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (“DACA”) program.  Though the government disputes these challenges on the merits, its \nprimary defenses concern the Court’s authority to hear the cases: the government contends that \nmost plaintiffs lack standing, that the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) deprives the Court \nof subject-matter jurisdiction, and that the Department’s decision to rescind DACA is not subject \nto review under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) because it was committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.  The government has moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, and \nplaintiffs have moved for summary judgment only on their APA claims.   \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 2 of 60\nThese are just two of a series of challenges to the September 2017 rescission of DACA that \nhave already been before several district courts, two circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme \nCourt on two occasions.  At this time, two preliminary injunctions are in place that require DHS \nto  accept  applications  for  the  renewal  of  DACA  benefits,  but  not  to  accept  new  DACA \napplications.  Here, through their pending motions, plaintiffs seek permanent injunctive relief, \nalthough only on their APA claims.  And the relief they seek would reach new as well as renewal \nDACA applications.  \nFor the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that it has both jurisdiction and statutory \nauthority to hear plaintiffs’ APA and constitutional claims.  The Court further concludes that, \nunder the APA, DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed \nadequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.  Neither the meager legal \nreasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision \nis sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program.  Thus, plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgment will be granted in part, and the decision to rescind DACA will be vacated and remanded \nto DHS.  Vacatur of DACA’s rescission will mean that DHS must accept and process new as well \nas renewal DACA applications.  The Court will stay its order of vacatur for ninety days, however, \nto allow the agency an opportunity to better explain its rescission decision. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 3 of 60\nBACKGROUND \nI.  THE IMPLEMENTATION AND RESCISSION OF DACA \nA.  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nIn 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum \nestablishing the DACA program, which allowed certain undocumented aliens1 who had been \nbrought to the United States as children to be treated as low priorities for removal under the federal \nimmigration laws.  See AR 1.2  According to the Secretary’s memorandum (the “DACA Memo”), \nthese young people generally “lacked the intent to violate the law” when they entered the United \nStates as children and, in many cases, “kn[e]w only this country as home” and had “contributed to \n[the] country in significant ways.”  AR 1–2.  DACA was therefore undertaken as “an exercise \nof . . . prosecutorial discretion” to “ensure that our enforcement resources are not expended on \nthese low priority cases.”  AR 1. \nDACA was available to any undocumented alien who: (1) came to the United States when \nshe was under the age of sixteen; (2) had lived in the United States continuously since at least June \n15, 2007; (3) was enrolled in school or had graduated from high school or been honorably \ndischarged from the military; (4) had not been convicted of certain criminal offenses and posed no \nthreat to national security or public safety; and (5) was under the age of thirty.  AR 1.  Aliens who \nmet these criteria were eligible for renewable, two-year grants of “deferred action” on their \n                                                 \n1 Some courts, including the Supreme Court, have referred to aliens who are unlawfully present in the United \nStates as “illegal” instead of “undocumented.”  See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 148 n.14 (5th Cir. \n2015) (explaining that this “is the term used by the Supreme Court in its latest pronouncement pertaining to this area \nof the law” (citation omitted)); but see Mohawk Indust., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 103 (2009) (using the term \n“undocumented immigrants”).  Because both terms appear in the record materials here, and because, as at least one \ncourt has noted, “there is a certain segment of the population that finds the phrase ‘illegal alien’ offensive,” Texas v. \nUnited States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 605 n.2 (S.D. Tex. 2015), the Court will use the term “undocumented.” \n2 Citations to “AR” refer to the administrative record.  See Joint Appendix [ECF No. 60].  \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 4 of 60\nremoval from the United States.  AR 2–3; see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (defining deferred action \nas “an act of administrative convenience to the government which gives some [removal] cases \nlower priority”).  As the DACA Memo was careful to point out, however, the program “confer[red] \nno substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship,” as “[o]nly the Congress, acting \nthrough its legislative authority, can confer these rights.”  AR 3. \nIndividuals who received deferred action under DACA were also eligible for a host of other \nbenefits  under  preexisting  statutes  and  DHS  regulations.    These  benefits  included  work \nauthorization, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(a)(11), social security numbers, id. § 1.3(a)(4)(vi), advance \nparole (i.e., preauthorization to travel to the United States without a visa), id. § 212.5, and a limited \nclass of public assistance, such as state and federal aid for medical emergencies, 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1611(b)(1), 1621(b)(1).  Benefits like these allowed DACA recipients to work, travel abroad, \naccess credit, and otherwise lead productive lives during their periods of deferred action.  \nTo be considered for deferred action under DACA, an applicant had to provide DHS with \ncertain identifying information, including her name, mailing address, and contact information.  See \nDecl. of Maria De La Cruz Perales Sanchez (“Perales Decl.”) [ECF No. 28-8] ¶ 11; see also Form \nI-821D,  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Servs.,  Consideration  for  Deferred  Action  for \nChildhood Arrivals, https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d.  Although many applicants feared that this \ninformation would later be used to initiate removal proceedings against them, see Perales Decl. ¶¶ \n10, 24, the Department assured applicants that their information would in most cases be “protected \nfrom disclosure to [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)] and U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings.”  See U.S. \nCitizenship  and  Immigration  Servs.,  Instructions  for  Consideration  of  Deferred  Action  for \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 5 of 60\nChildhood Arrivals, https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d.  Relying on these representations, hundreds of \nthousands of undocumented aliens applied for and received deferred action under the DACA \nprogram.  See, e.g., Perales Decl. ¶ 10; Decl. of John Doe #1 ¶ 6; Decl. of John Doe #2 ¶ 5.  By \nlate 2017, nearly 800,000 individuals had been granted deferred action under DACA.  AR 242. \nB.  Deferred Action for Parents of Americans  \nTwo years after DACA’s implementation, DHS issued a second memorandum, this time \npurporting to establish a deferred-action program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \n(“DAPA”).  AR 37–41.  As its name suggests, DAPA would have offered deferred action to parents \nof U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who were themselves unlawfully present in the \nUnited States.3  AR 40–41.  The DAPA memorandum also purported to expand the DACA \nprogram in certain respects: it would have removed the thirty-year age cap, made the deferred-\naction grants last for three years instead of two, and required that an alien need only have been \npresent in the United States since January 1, 2010 to be eligible.  AR 39–40.  \nBefore  DAPA  took  effect,  a  coalition  of  states,  led  by  Texas,  sued  to  block  its \nimplementation on grounds that it violated both the APA and the Take Care Clause of the \nConstitution.  See Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 604 & n.1, 607 (citing U.S. Const. art. II, § 3).  The \ndistrict court granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that they were \nlikely to succeed on their procedural APA claim that DAPA (including its expansion of DACA) \nshould have been promulgated using notice and comment.  Id. at 671–72; see 5 U.S.C. § 553.  In \n                                                 \n3 DAPA would have applied to any alien who: (1) had a son or daughter who was a U.S. citizen or lawful \npermanent resident; (2) had continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) was physically \npresent in the United States both on November 20, 2014 and the date of her application; (4) had no lawful basis to be \npresent in the United States on November 20, 2014; (5) did not meet certain enforcement priorities; and (6) did not \notherwise raise concerns that would make deferred action inappropriate in the agency’s discretion.  See AR 40.   \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 6 of 60\npart, this was because the Department’s implementation of DACA suggested that DAPA would \nnot “genuinely leave[] the agency and its employees free to exercise discretion.”  Texas, 86 F. \nSupp. 3d at 604 at 670 (emphasis, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).  The district \ncourt found that only about 5% of all DACA applications had been denied, and the government \ncould not say how many of those had been denied for discretionary reasons.  Id. at 609.  This led \nthe court to conclude that the DAPA Memo’s suggestion that immigration officers could exercise \ncase-by-case discretion was “merely pretext.”  Id. at 669 n. 101; see Texas, 809 F.3d at 173 \n(agreeing that although “[t]he DACA and DAPA Memos purport to grant discretion, . . . there was \nevidence from DACA’s implementation that DAPA’s discretionary language was pretextual”). \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the states had demonstrated a likelihood of success \non the merits not only of their procedural APA claim, but also on their substantive APA claim, \nbecause DAPA seemed to conflict with the INA’s “intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a \nlawful immigration classification from their children’s immigration status.”4  Texas, 809 F.3d at \n179.  But the court expressly declined to address the states’ constitutional challenges.  See id. at \n146 n.3 (finding it “unnecessary” to address those claims “at this early stage of the proceedings”).  \nIt also rejected the government’s threshold arguments—similar to the ones offered here—that the \nstates lacked standing, see id. at 150–63, that the INA deprived the court of subject-matter \njurisdiction, see id. at 164–65, and that DAPA’s implementation was unreviewable under the APA, \nsee id. at 165–72.5  The government petitioned for certiorari, and in June 2016, an eight-Justice \n                                                 \n4 According to the Fifth Circuit, under the INA, the parent must generally “(i) have a U.S. citizen child who \nis at least twenty-one years old, (ii) leave the United States, (iii) wait ten years, and then (iv) obtain one of the limited \nnumber of family-preference visas from a United States consulate.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 179–80.  \n5 All parties agreed that DAPA was “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. §701(a)(2), to the \nextent that it “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at least temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as to a \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 7 of 60\nSupreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an equally divided vote.  See United States \nv. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (mem).   \nOn January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump was sworn into office, and his nominee \nfor Secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, was confirmed that same day.  Six months \nlater, Secretary Kelly issued a memorandum rescinding DAPA, including its expansion of DACA, \nbut leaving the original DACA program in place.  AR 235–236.  The Texas plaintiffs voluntarily \ndismissed their challenge to DAPA a few months later.  See Pls.’ Stipulation of Voluntary \nDismissal, Texas v. United States, No. 14-CV-254 (S.D. Tex. Sep. 12, 2017), ECF No. 473. \nC.  The Rescission of DACA \nOn September 5, 2017, three months after DAPA’s rescission, then-Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security Elaine C. Duke issued a five-page memorandum rescinding DACA (the \n“Rescission  Memo”).6    See  AR  252–56.    The  Rescission  Memo  began  by  canvassing  the \nprocedural history of the Texas litigation, and then noted that “[a]lthough the original DACA \npolicy was not challenged in [that] lawsuit, both the district and appellate court decisions relied on \nfactual  findings  about  the  implementation  of  the  2012  DACA  memorandum.”    AR  253.  \nSpecifically, the memorandum noted that “[t]he Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that \nDACA decisions were not truly discretionary,” and that “[b]oth the district court and the Fifth \nCircuit concluded that implementation of the program did not comply with the [APA] because the \nDepartment did not implement it through notice-and-comment rulemaking.”  AR 253–54.   \n                                                 \nclass of what he deems to be low-priority illegal aliens,” Texas, 809 F.3d at 166 (“[Plaintiffs] have not challenged the \npriority levels [the Secretary] has established, and neither the [district court’s] preliminary injunction nor compliance \nwith the APA requires the Secretary to remove any alien or to alter his enforcement priorities”).  But the Fifth Circuit \nnonetheless found DAPA to be reviewable because it was “much more than nonenforcement: [i]t would affirmatively \nconfer ‘lawful presence’ and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”  Id. \n6 Secretary Kelly had since been appointed to serve as President Trump’s chief of staff.  \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 8 of 60\nThe memorandum also stated that in June 2017, after DAPA had been rescinded but before \nthe Texas litigation was voluntarily dismissed, Texas and the other state plaintiffs in that case had \nsent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatening to challenge DACA in court unless he \nrescinded the program by September 5, 2017.  AR 254; see AR 238–240 (Texas’s demand letter).  \nAttorney General Sessions then sent a one-page letter to Acting Secretary Duke (the “Sessions \nLetter”) instructing her to rescind DACA.  AR 251.  The Sessions Letter explained that the program \nhad been “effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper \nstatutory authority and . . . after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would \nhave accomplished a similar result,” and that “[s]uch an open-ended circumvention of immigration \nlaws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”  Id.  The letter also \nnoted that because DACA suffered from “the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts \nrecognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results \nwith  respect  to  DACA.”    Id.    The  letter  instructed  Acting  Secretary  Duke  to  “consider” \nimplementing “an orderly and efficient wind-down process” for the program.  Id.  \nIn light of the Texas litigation and the Sessions Letter, the Rescission Memo concluded, “it \nis clear that the . . . DACA program should be terminated.”  AR 255.  Given “the complexities \nassociated with winding down the program,” however, the Department decided to “provide a \nlimited  window  in  which  it  will  adjudicate  certain  requests  for  DACA  and  associated \napplications.”  Id.  Thus, the Department would adjudicate any properly filed DACA applications \nthat were pending as of September 5, 2017, as well as any new applications for the renewal of \nDACA benefits that were filed on or before October 5, 2017 by persons whose benefits were set \nto expire on or before March 5, 2018.  It would also honor (in most cases) existing grants of \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 9 of 60\ndeferred action, work authorization, and advance parole.  But it would reject all other DACA \napplications, including any initial applications filed after September 5, 2017, and all pending and \nfuture applications for advance parole under the DACA program.  Effectively, then, DACA \nbenefits were made unavailable to any alien who had not already applied, and existing DACA \ngrants would be allowed to expire permanently beginning in March 2018.  Finally, like the earlier \nDACA and DAPA memorandums, the Rescission Memo stated that it “is not intended to, does \nnot,  and  may  not  be  relied  upon  to  create  any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural, \nenforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.”  AR 256.   \nII.  LEGAL CHALLENGES TO DACA’S RESCISSION \nSince September 2017, legal challenges to DACA’s rescission have been filed in federal \ndistrict courts throughout the country.  Two of these challenges have made their way to the federal \ncourts of appeals, and one has been to the Supreme Court.  Because these challenges generally \ninvolve similar administrative and constitutional claims, the Court will not address the plaintiffs’ \nassertions in each case in detail.  Nevertheless, a brief overview of this pending litigation landscape \nwill be useful to understand the state of DACA’s rescission today.7  \nA.  Regents of the University of California v. DHS \nThe first set of challenges to DACA’s rescission was filed in September 2017 in federal \ndistrict court in California.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 \nF. Supp. 3d 1011, 1026 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  The plaintiffs in those cases are the University of \nCalifornia, the State of California and several other states, a group of individual DACA recipients, \n                                                 \n7 One case, Park v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-1332 (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 21, 2017), was dismissed pursuant to a \nstipulation by all parties on March 1, 2018, before any relief was granted.  The Court will not discuss that case further.  \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 10 of 60\ntwo California municipalities, and a labor union.  See id.  Though not formally consolidated, the \ncases  were  all  assigned  to  U.S.  District  Judge  William  H.  Alsup.    See  Case  Management \nScheduling Order, Regents, No. 17-5211 (N.D. Cal. Sept 22, 2017), ECF No. 49.   \nShortly  after  the  actions  were  filed,  the  government  filed  an  administrative  record \nconsisting of “fourteen documents comprising 256 pages of which 187 consisted of published \nopinions from the DAPA litigation.”  Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1028.  “All non-public materials, \nsome eighty-four documents, actually reviewed by the Acting Secretary remained withheld as \nprivileged.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The district court ordered the government to complete the \nrecord, denying many of the government’s claims of privilege.  Id.  at 1028–29.  The government \npetitioned the Ninth Circuit for a writ of mandamus, but the court of appeals denied the petition.  \nSee In re United States, 875 F.3d 1200 (9th Cir. 2017).  The government then sought the same \nrelief from the Supreme Court, which construed the government’s mandamus petition as a petition \nfor a writ of certiorari, granted it, vacated the Ninth Circuit’s order, and directed the district court \nto “first resolve[] the Government’s threshold arguments,” since those arguments, “if accepted, \nlikely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative \nrecord.”  In re United States, 138 S. Ct. 443, 444–45 (2017) (per curiam).  \nWhile the litigation over the administrative record was pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion \nfor preliminary injunctive relief, and the government moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaints \nboth for lack of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state \na claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1029.  Then, following the Supreme \nCourt’s instruction to first address the government’s threshold arguments, the district court denied \nthe government’s Rule 12(b)(1) motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 11 of 60\ninjunction.  Id. at 1036–37.  The injunction directed DHS to resume accepting applications for the \nrenewal  of  DACA  benefits,  although  it  did  not  require  the  agency  to  accept  new  DACA \napplications or to afford current DACA beneficiaries advance parole.  See id. at 1048–49.   \nIn a separate order entered a few days later, the district court denied the government’s Rule \n12(b)(6) motion except as to the plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment and Regulatory Flexibility Act \nclaims.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No 17-CV-05211, 2018 \nWL 401177, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2018).  The government appealed both orders, and the Ninth \nCircuit set an expedited briefing schedule.  See Order, Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec., No. 18-15068 (9th Cir. Jan. 17, 2018), ECF No. 2.  The government also \npetitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment, but the Supreme Court \ndenied the petition.  See Order, Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 17-\n1003 (U.S. Feb. 26, 2018).  The government’s appeal is currently pending before the Ninth Circuit. \nB.  Batalla Vidal v. Duke  \nThe second challenge also came about in September 2017 when Martin Batalla Vidal, an \nindividual DACA beneficiary who was already engaged in litigation with the Department over the \nrevocation of his employment authorization, amended his complaint to assert a challenge to \nDACA’s rescission.  See Batalla Vidal v. Duke, No. 16-CV-4756, 2017 WL 5201116, at *4 \n(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2017).  His challenge was later consolidated with two others before Judge \nNicholas G. Garaufis of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Id.  The \nplaintiffs in the three cases include Mr. Batalla Vidal, the State of New York, fourteen other states \nand the District of Columbia, and Make the Road New York, a nonprofit.  See id. at *4 & n.5. \nShortly after the consolidation of the three actions, another dispute arose regarding the \nscope of the administrative record.  The district court ordered the government to produce certain \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 12 of 60\ndocuments, see id. at *6–7, and, on the government’s petition for mandamus, the Second Circuit \nstayed discovery pending the district court’s resolution of “issues of jurisdiction and justiciability.”  \nId. at *8.  The government then filed a motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  Id.   \nThe district court denied the government’s Rule 12(b)(1) motion (except as to some \nplaintiffs that the court found lacked standing), see id. at *20, but it later certified its decision for \nan interlocutory appeal, see Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 16-CV-4756, 2018 WL 333515, at *1 \n(E.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2018).  The Second Circuit then held the government’s petition for leave to file \nan interlocutory appeal in abeyance pending the district court’s resolution of the government’s \nRule 12(b)(6) motion and the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which the plaintiffs \nhad filed while issues related to the interlocutory appeal were being litigated.  See Certified Order, \nNielsen v. Vidal, No. 18-122 (2d Cir. Jan. 31, 2018), ECF No. 46.  \nA few weeks later, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  See Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 401, 437–38 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).  The scope \nof the court’s injunction was the same as in Regents: it required the Department to resume \nconsideration of renewal applications but did not require the consideration of initial applications \nor applications for advance parole.  Id. at 437–38.  The government took an interlocutory appeal, \nand the next day, the Second Circuit denied the mandamus petition that it had previously held in \nabeyance and vacated its earlier discovery stay.  See Certified Order, In re Nielson, No. 17-3345 \n(2d Cir. Feb. 21, 2018), ECF No. 181.  The Second Circuit thereafter granted the government’s \nmotion to expedite the appeal, which is pending at this time.  See Certified Order, Vidal v. Nielsen, \nNo. 18-485 (2d Cir. Mar. 8, 2018), ECF No. 62. \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 13 of 60\nWhile the expedited appeal was pending, the district court granted in part and denied in \npart the government’s pending 12(b)(6) motion.8  See Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, No. 16-cv-4756, \n2018 WL 1532370, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2018).  The court denied the motion as to plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive  APA  claims  for  substantially  the  same  reasons  that  it  had  previously  found  a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of those claims, id. at *3, but granted the motion as \nto their procedural APA and Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) claims.  Id. at *5–6.  The court \nalso denied the motion as to the plaintiffs’ equal protection claims, id. at *6–10, although it granted \nthe motion as to their information-sharing claim, concluding that the plaintiffs had “not plausibly \nalleged that DHS actually changed its information-sharing policy,” id. at *11.  Finally, the court \ngranted the motion as to plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim, except as to certain plaintiffs \nwho alleged that their renewal applications had been improperly rejected as untimely or were \nerroneously deemed to contain minor clerical errors.  Id. at *14. \nC.  Casa de Maryland v. DHS  \nThe plaintiffs in the third case, CASA de Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, \n284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (D. Md. 2018), are individual DACA recipients and several nonprofit \norganizations.  In March 2018, the district court (Judge Roger W. Titus) ruled that although \nDACA’s rescission was reviewable, it did not violate the APA or the Equal Protection or Due \nProcess Clauses.  See id. at 770, 773–77, 779.  The district court summarized its decision to depart \nfrom the Regents and Batalla Vidal courts on the substantive APA claim as follows: \nThe decisions to date by courts in California and New York are premised on the \nlegal conclusion that DACA is lawful, and therefore, a decision to rescind \nDACA on the basis of unlawfulness is necessarily arbitrary and capricious.  \n                                                 \n8 That motion also sought dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) (on standing and mootness grounds) of the Batalla \nVidal plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim, which had been presented for the first time in their third amended \ncomplaint.  Batalla Vidal, 2018 WL 1532370, at *12–13.  The court denied the motion to dismiss on that ground.  \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 14 of 60\nRespectfully, this Court disagrees.  Regardless of the lawfulness of DACA, the \nappropriate inquiry is whether or not DHS made a reasoned decision to rescind \nDACA based on the Administrative Record . . . .  Given the fate of DAPA, the \nlegal advice provided by the Attorney General, and the threat of imminent \nlitigation, it was reasonable for DHS to have concluded—right or wrong—that \nDACA  was  unlawful  and  should  be  wound  down  in  an  orderly  manner.  \nTherefore, its decision to rescind DACA cannot be arbitrary and capricious. \nId. at 767–768 (citation omitted).  However, the district court did grant one form of relief not \ngranted by the courts in Regents or Batalla Vidal: it enjoined DHS from “using information \nprovided by Dreamers through the DACA program for enforcement purposes,” explaining that so \ndoing would violate applicable principles of equitable estoppel.  Id. at 779.  As of the date of this \ndecision, neither party has appealed the district court’s order, although the time in which to do so \nhas not yet expired.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4 (a)(1)(B).  \nIII.  THE PRESENT CHALLENGES TO DACA’S RESCISSION  \nThe cases currently before this Court, NAACP v. Trump and Princeton v. United States, \nwere filed in September and November 2017, respectively, and have been consolidated for \npurposes of the dispositive motions pending in each.  The plaintiffs in the Princeton action are \nPrinceton University, Microsoft Corporation, and Maria de la Cruz Perales Sanchez, a DACA \nbeneficiary and Princeton undergraduate.  See Compl. (“Princeton Compl.”) [ECF No. 1] at 12.  \nThe plaintiffs in the NAACP action are the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople (“NAACP”), the American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”), and the United Food and \nCommercial Workers International Union (“UFCW”).  See First Amended Complaint at 3–5, \nNAACP, No. 17-cv-1907 (D.D.C. Oct. 24, 2017), ECF No. 10 (“NAACP FAC”).  Both sets of \nplaintiffs challenge DACA’s rescission on various administrative and constitutional grounds, \nincluding that it was arbitrary and capricious, see Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 15 of 60\n(“Princeton MSJ”) at 11–38; that it should have undergone notice-and-comment procedures, see \nid. at 38–41; that its effects on “small entities” should have been analyzed pursuant to the RFA, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 601–12, see NAACP FAC 16–17; and that it violates the Equal Protection and Due \nProcess Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Princeton Compl. at 35–40.   \nThe government has filed motions to dismiss in both actions.  It argues: (1) that plaintiffs’ \nAPA claims should be dismissed because DACA’s rescission was “committed to agency discretion \nby law” and is therefore unreviewable under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), see Mem. of Law in Supp. of \nDefs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (“Princeton MTD”) [ECF No. 8] at 14–21; (2) that a provision of the INA, \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), deprives the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, see id. at 21–24; (3) that all \nplaintiffs but Ms. Perales Sanchez lack Article III and prudential standing, see id. at 24–25; Mem. \nin Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, No. 17-cv-1907 (D.D.C. Nov. 8, 2018) (“NAACP MTD”) at \n14–18; and (4) that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA, the RFA, and the \nConstitution, Princeton MTD at 27–44.   \nPlaintiffs have moved for summary judgment only on their APA claims, or alternatively, \nfor preliminary injunctive relief “[t]o the extent the Court wishes to see [the discovery] issues [in \nRegents and Batalla Vidal] litigated before granting final judgment to the Plaintiffs.”  Princeton \nMSJ at 3 & n.1.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Regents and Batalla Vidal, however, plaintiffs here have \nnot challenged the completeness of the administrative record, see 5 U.S.C. § 706 (providing that, \nin reviewing agency action, “the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a \nparty” (emphasis added)), and the government urges the Court to decide the pending motions on \nthe current record, see Princeton MTD at 3 (“[T]he Court should either uphold the Rescission \nPolicy and grant this motion if it agrees that the record supports Defendants’ position, or set aside \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 16 of 60\nthe Rescission Policy if it disagrees.”).  Finally, plaintiffs have also moved for a preliminary \ninjunction  preventing  DHS  from  sharing  or  otherwise  using  DACA  beneficiaries’  personal \ninformation for immigration enforcement purposes.  See Princeton MSJ at 48–53.   \nThe Court initially set a motions hearing in this case for February 2018, but the hearing \nwas continued at the parties’ request pending the government’s petition for certiorari before \njudgment in the Regents case.  See January 26, 2018 Min. Order.  That petition was denied in late \nFebruary, and the Court held a motions hearing in mid-March.  The parties’ motions are now ripe \nfor decision.  \nDISCUSSION \nI.  SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION \nA.  The Immigration and Nationality Act \nThe government argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over all of plaintiffs’ claims—\nadministrative and constitutional—under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), a provision of the INA that states \nthat “no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising \nfrom the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, \nor execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.”  On its face, that language removes \njurisdiction only as to the three listed actions of the Attorney General.  The government argues \nthat “[t]he denial of deferred action is a step toward the commencement of removal proceedings \nagainst an alien” and that “the INA’s careful scheme for [removal] proceedings” suggests that such \ndenials may be challenged only through individual removal proceedings, and hence § 1252(g) \nstrips the Court of jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ challenge here.  Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of their Mot. \nto Dismiss (“Defs.’ Reply”) [ECF No. 56] at 10.  \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 17 of 60\nThe government’s position contradicts not only the plain language of § 1252(g) but also \nthe  Supreme  Court’s  interpretation  of  that  language  in  Reno  v.  American–Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee (“AAADC”), where the Court specifically rejected the argument that \n“the mention of three discrete events along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of referring \nto all claims arising from deportation proceedings.”  525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999).  Rather, the Court \nexplained, § 1252(g) applies “only to three discrete actions that the Attorney General may take: \nher ‘decision or action’ to ‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  \nId. (listing “part[s] of the deportation process” that fall outside of § 1252(g)’s scope, including \n“decisions to open an investigation, to surveil the suspected violator, to reschedule the deportation \nhearing, to include various provisions in the final order that is the product of the adjudication, and \nto  refuse  reconsideration  of  that  order”).    Because  the  rescission  of  DACA  is  neither  the \ncommencement of a proceeding, the adjudication of a case, nor the execution of a removal order, \n§ 1252(g) is inapplicable here pursuant to the provision’s plain language.  \nThe government’s only response is that DACA’s rescission is a “step toward” the removal \nof specific aliens.  See Defs.’ Reply at 10; but see id. at 2 (stressing elsewhere that rescission “does \nnot, in itself, exert the agency’s coercive power over any individual”).  True, the Supreme Court \nsaid in AAADC that § 1252(g) was “specifically directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and \nhence prolongation of removal proceedings.”  525 U.S. at 487.  But there is no allegation here that \nremoval proceedings have yet been initiated against any DACA beneficiary, so there are no \npending removal proceedings with which plaintiffs’ challenge might interfere.  Cf. id. (concluding \nthat § 1252(g) stripped jurisdiction over selective deportation claims brought by six aliens who \nwere then in removal proceedings).  Thus, the government’s reliance on AAADC is misplaced, \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 18 of 60\nand § 1252(g) does not bar review here.  Accord Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1031–1033 (rejecting \nthe government’s § 1252(g) argument); Batalla Vidal, 2017 WL 5201116, at *12–13 (same). \nB.  Article III Standing \nThe government also asks the Court to dismiss the claims brought by Princeton and \nMicrosoft, Princeton MTD at 24–25, and by all plaintiffs in the NAACP action, see NAACP MTD \nat 14–17, for lack of Article III standing.  In so moving, the government urges the Court to conduct \na “claim-by-claim analysis” of each plaintiff’s standing as to each claim.  Defs.’ Reply 11.   \nSuch a detailed analysis is unnecessary, however, at least in Princeton.  The government \ndoes not dispute that the individual plaintiff, Ms. Perales Sanchez, has Article III standing to assert \neach claim in the complaint.9  See Princeton MTD 24–25 (seeking dismissal only as to the “[n]on-\n[i]ndividual [p]laintiffs”); Princeton Compl. 30–38 (listing Ms. Perales Sanchez as a plaintiff on \neach count).  And as the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed, Article III requires only that “[a]t \nleast one plaintiff . . . have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.”  Town \nof Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017).  In Princeton, that “one plaintiff” \nis Ms. Perales Sanchez, and no further analysis of any other plaintiff’s standing is necessary. \n                                                 \n9 Nor could they.  Ms. Perales Sanchez clearly satisfies the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing \nas to DACA’s rescission: her inability to renew her DACA benefits is (1) an “injury in fact,” which is “concrete and \nparticularized” as well as “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; it is (2) “fairly traceable” to DHS’s \ndecision to rescind DACA; and it is (3) “likely to be redressed” by a decision of this Court invalidating DACA’s \nrescission.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547–48 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And although \nthe Court ultimately concludes that plaintiffs fail to state a claim as to DHS’s alleged plans to share DACA \nbeneficiaries’ information with immigration enforcement agencies, the Court concludes—and the government does \nnot dispute—that Ms. Perales Sanchez has standing to assert that claim as well.  See Princeton Compl. ¶ 108 (alleging \nthat DHS has “revised [its] assurances about information sharing” and now “offer[s] only to prevent personal \ninformation from being provided ‘proactively’ to agencies responsible for facilitating removal”); cf. Clapper v. \nAmnesty Int’l, 568 U.S. 398, 411 (2013) (finding that the plaintiffs’ asserted injury was too speculative when it relied \non a hypothetical sequence of government actions that culminated in their communications being monitored).   \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 19 of 60\nIn NAACP, however, there is no individual plaintiff.  The organizational plaintiffs—the \nNAACP  and  two  labor  unions—therefore  must  rely  on  their  own  standing  to  survive  the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss.  These plaintiffs assert that they have “associational standing,” \nwhich requires each of them to plead that “(1) at least one of its members would have standing to \nsue in his or her own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to its purpose; and (3) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of an individual \nmember of the organization in the suit.”  AARP v. EEOC, 226 F. Supp. 3d 7, 16 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(citation omitted).  As in Princeton, if one of the three NAACP plaintiffs has standing, then an \nanalysis of the remaining plaintiffs’ standing is unnecessary.  \nThe parties do not dispute that the NAACP plaintiffs meet the third prong of the test for \nrepresentational standing—they do.  See NAACP MTD at 16–17 (not arguing that the participation \nof individual members should be required).  And although the government contends that the \nNAACP plaintiffs fail the first prong because their complaint does not “name a specific member \nwith standing,” see id. at 16, each plaintiff provided an anonymous affidavit from at least one of \nits members stating that the member was a DACA beneficiary, see, e.g., Princeton MSJ, Ex. W \n[ECF No. 28-17] (declaration of NAACP member), and the government does not seriously \ndispute—nor could it—that these affidavits are sufficient.10  Thus, the only remaining issue is \nwhether the rescission of DACA is germane to the organizational plaintiffs’ purposes. \n                                                 \n10 The government initially argued that the organizational plaintiffs had to name these members.  See NAACP \nMTD at 16.  The authority for that proposition is tenuous, however, see Young Am.’s Found. v. Gates, 560 F. Supp. \n2d  39,  49  (D.D.C.  2008)  (“[I]t  is  not  clear  that  [associational  standing]  actually  requires  a  name-specific \nidentification.”), aff’d, 573 F.3d 797 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879, 884 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]e have \nnever held that a party suing as a representative must specifically name the individual on whose behalf the suit is \nbrought . . . .”), and the government did not renew the argument in its reply brief, see Defs.’ Reply at 12–13.   \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 20 of 60\nThe germaneness requirement is “undemanding” and requires “mere pertinence between \nlitigation subject and organizational purpose.”  Humane Soc. of the U.S. v. Hodel, 840 F.2d 45, \n58 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Here, the NAACP has alleged that its purpose is to “ensure the political, \neducational, social, and economic equality of all persons,” particularly “people of color.”  NAACP \nCompl. at 3–4.  This mission is “pertinent” to the subject of the litigation here, because plaintiffs \nhave alleged that “[n]early all of the DACA registrants—more than 95%—are people of color,” \nid. at 12, and that DACA confers various educational, social, and economic benefits on those \nindividuals, see id. at 2.  At this stage of the litigation, these allegations are sufficient to establish \nthe NAACP’s standing—which, in turn, is sufficient to establish the standing of the other two \nplaintiffs in the NAACP action.  See Hodel, 840 F.2d at 59 (concluding that an association’s \n“members’ aesthetic interest in viewing live animals and birds” was sufficiently germane to a \nlawsuit whose purpose was “keeping animals and birds alive and well”).  Thus, at least one plaintiff \nhas standing to assert every claim in both of the actions currently before the Court, and the \ngovernment’s motions to dismiss for lack of standing will be denied.   \nII.  ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES \nAs noted above, plaintiffs assert various administrative challenges to DACA’s rescission, \nincluding that it was arbitrary and capricious, that it required notice and comment, and that it ran \nafoul of RFA’s requirement that an agency consider the effects of its actions on small entities.  The \ngovernment raises two threshold arguments that apply only to plaintiffs’ administrative claims: \nfirst, that DACA’s rescission was unreviewable under the APA’s carve-out for actions “committed \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 21 of 60\nto agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2);11 and second, that plaintiffs fall outside the \n“zone of interests” protected by the APA and RFA.  The Court will first address the government’s \nthreshold arguments and then proceed to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims.  \nA.  Reviewability  \nThe APA “applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that—(1) \nstatutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 701(a).  The Supreme Court has explained the difference between § 701(a)(1) and (a)(2) \nas follows:  \nThe former applies when Congress has expressed an intent to preclude judicial \nreview.  The latter applies in different circumstances; even where Congress has not \naffirmatively precluded review, review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so \nthat a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \nexercise of discretion.  In such a case, the statute (‘law’) can be taken to have \n‘committed’ the decisionmaking to the agency’s judgment absolutely.  \nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 828 (1985) (emphasis added).  Thus, in determining whether a \nparticular agency action is “committed to agency discretion by law,” courts ask whether “statutes \nare drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.”  Id. (citations and \ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“[T]he \n‘no law to apply’ formula has come to refer to the search for substantive legal criteria against \nwhich an agency’s conduct can be seriously evaluated.”).   \nOne category of agency action that the Court has held to be “presumptively unreviewable” \nunder § 701(a)(2) is an agency’s decision “not to institute enforcement proceedings.”  Lincoln v. \nVigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993) (citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831).  The Supreme Court first \n                                                 \n11 “[A] complaint seeking review of agency action ‘committed to agency discretion by law’ has failed to state \na claim under the APA, and therefore should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6), not under the jurisdictional provision \nof Rule 12(b)(1).”  Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 22 of 60\nidentified this presumption in Chaney, a case in which a group of death-sentenced prisoners \npetitioned the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to prevent the use in lethal injections of \ncertain drugs that the agency had not approved for that purpose.  See 470 U.S. at 823.  The FDA \nrefused, explaining not only that was it “unclear” that it had “jurisdiction over the unapproved use \nof approved drugs for human execution,” but also that given the absence of any “danger to the \npublic health or a blatant scheme to defraud,” even if the agency did have jurisdiction, it would \n“decline to exercise [that jurisdiction] under [its] inherent discretion to decline to pursue certain \nenforcement matters.”  Id. at 824–25.  The plaintiffs filed suit, seeking an order directing the FDA \nto take enforcement action.  The district court granted summary judgment for the agency, holding \nthat its decision not to act was unreviewable under § 701(a)(2), but the court of appeals reversed \nwith instructions to order the agency to “fulfill its statutory function.”  Id. at 825–27.   \nThe  Supreme  Court  granted  certiorari  and  reversed.    “[A]gency  decisions  to  refuse \nenforcement,” the Court explained, are “general[ly] unsuit[able] for judicial review” for several \nreasons.  Id. at 831.  Such decisions call for “a complicated balancing of a number of factors which \nare peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including “whether agency resources are best spent \non this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, [and] whether the \nparticular enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies.”  Id.  Moreover, \nnonenforcement decisions generally do not involve the exercise of “coercive power over an \nindividual’s liberty or property rights”; they provide no “focus for judicial review”; and they \n“share[] to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch \nnot to indict—a decision which has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive \nBranch.”  Id. at 832.  For these reasons, such decisions have “traditionally been ‘committed to \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 23 of 60\nagency discretion,’ and we believe that the Congress enacting the APA did not intend to alter that \ntradition.”  Id.  Thus, the Court concluded, “an agency’s decision not to take enforcement action \nshould be presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).”  Id.  The Court was careful \nto note, however, that this presumption of unreviewability “may be rebutted where the substantive \nstatute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.”  Id. \nat 833.  Critically for purposes of this case, moreover, the Court reserved judgment on whether the \npresumption applies where an agency “refuse[s] . . . to institute proceedings based solely on the \nbelief that it lacks jurisdiction.”  Id. at 833 n.4 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nAlthough the Supreme Court has not yet answered the question reserved in Chaney, the \nD.C. Circuit has addressed it.  In Crowley Caribbean Transport, Inc. v. Pena, for example, the issue \nwas whether Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability applied to the Maritime Administration’s \nrefusal to take an enforcement action under a provision of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (the \n“1936 Act”) that the agency thought was inapplicable as a matter of law.  See 37 F.3d at 672–73.  \nThe D.C. Circuit began by noting that Chaney had reserved judgment on almost exactly this issue \nand then observed that two intervening circuit decisions seemed to have answered the question in \ncontradictory ways.  See id. at 675–76 (citing Safe Energy Coal. of Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Comm’n, 866 F.2d 1473, 1477 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (presumption of unreviewability \napplied  to  the  agency’s  refusal,  based  on  its  interpretation  of  its  own  regulations,  to  take \nenforcement action against a nuclear reactor); Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agric. \nImplement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 783 F.2d 237, 244–45 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (presumption of \nunreviewability did not apply to the Department of Labor’s refusal, based on its interpretation of \nthe labor laws, to take enforcement action in response to a union complaint)). \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 24 of 60\nAfter noting that “[a]s a circuit, we seem to have no explicit rule on how to proceed when \nwe have inconsistent precedents,” id. at 675, the court relied on language from an intervening \nSupreme Court decision, ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (“BLE”), 482 U.S. 270 \n(1987), to resolve the intra-circuit split.  BLE held that an agency’s refusal to reconsider a decision \non the basis of “material error”—that is, because it was erroneous when made, not because of \nchanged circumstances or newly discovered evidence—is “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw” under § 701(a)(2), even if it is based on the agency’s interpretation of a statute.  Id. at 278–\n84.  In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court rejected what it took to be the concurrence’s \nsuggestion that “if [an] agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action, the \naction becomes reviewable.”12  Id. at 283.  To refute this proposition, the Court explained,  \nit is enough to observe that a common reason for failure to prosecute an alleged \ncriminal violation is the prosecutor’s belief (sometimes publicly stated) that the law \nwill not sustain a conviction.  That is surely an eminently “reviewable” proposition, \nin the sense that courts are well qualified to consider the point; yet it is entirely \nclear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject of judicial review.  \nId.  Citing this passage, the Crowley court concluded that BLE, “though not in the Chaney context, \nsquarely rejects the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-\nreviewable actions.”  Crowley, 37 F.3d at 676.  Thus, the court held, there was “no basis for review \nof the Maritime Administrator’s single-shot non-enforcement decision.”  Id.   \nThe D.C. Circuit in Crowley was careful to preserve another line of circuit precedent, \nhowever, which holds that Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability does not apply to “an \n                                                 \n12 The concurrence disputed this characterization of its argument.  See id. at 290 n.2 (Stevens, J., concurring \nin the judgment).  Its point was that because an agency’s action can be sustained only on the grounds invoked by the \nagency, “when an agency explains that it has denied a petition for reopening based on . . . its reading of a statute or a \nconstitutional provision, its decision cannot be sustained on the conjecture that it has the discretion to deny reopening \non a variety of grounds.”  BLE, 482 U.S. at 290–291 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).   \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 25 of 60\nagency’s announcement of its interpretation of a statute, even when that interpretation is advanced \nin the context of a decision not to take enforcement action.”  Edison Elec. Inst. v. EPA, 996 F.2d \n326, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).13  The key difference, \nthe Crowley court explained, was that while the case before it involved an agency’s refusal to act \non a single complaint, those prior cases involved “an agency’s statement of a general enforcement \npolicy”  that  was  either  “expressed . . . as  a  formal  regulation  after  the  full  rulemaking \nprocess . . . or . . . otherwise articulated . . . in some form of universal policy statement.”  Crowley, \n37 F.3d at 676.  The court then pointed out the “ample reasons for distinguishing the two”: \n[First,] general statements [of enforcement policy] . . . are more likely to be direct \ninterpretations of the commands of the substantive statute rather than the sort of \nmingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive an individual enforcement \ndecision  and  that  are,  as  Chaney  recognizes,  peculiarly  within  the  agency’s \nexpertise and discretion.  Second, an agency’s pronouncement of a broad policy \nagainst enforcement poses special risks that it ‘has consciously and expressly \nadopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its \nstatutory responsibilities,’ a situation in which the normal presumption of non-\nreviewability may be inappropriate.  Finally, an agency will generally present a \nclearer (and more easily reviewable) statement of its reasons for acting when \nformally articulating a broadly applicable enforcement policy . . . . \nId. at 677 (quoting Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4).  Thus, the court concluded in Crowley, an \nindividual nonenforcement decision is presumptively unreviewable even if it is based solely on \nlegal grounds, even though “an agency’s statement of a general enforcement policy may be \nreviewable for legal sufficiency.”  Id. at 676–677. \n                                                 \n13 See id. (holding that the presumption of unreviewability did not apply to the agency’s determination that a \nstatutory requirement applied to the plaintiffs, even though that determination was made in a policy statement that \ncommunicated the agency’s intent not to enforce that requirement); Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. EPA, 980 F.2d 765, 773 \n(D.C. Cir. 1992) (“[T]he presumption of unreviewability of agency nonenforcement decisions is inapplicable or at \nleast rebutted [where a plaintiff] raises a facial challenge to [an agency’s] statutory interpretation embodied in [a \nregulation] and does not contest a particular enforcement decision.”).   \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 26 of 60\nThe D.C. Circuit has applied Crowley only once, in OSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, \n132 F.3d 808 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  In that case, a plaintiff challenged the Maritime Administration’s \nlongstanding policy of refusing to enforce a different provision of the 1936 Act against certain \nvessels.  See id. at 811 (explaining that the agency had “long allowed” vessels built with the aid \nof a federal subsidy that was reserved for ships that would be operated exclusively in foreign trade \nto enter the domestic shipping market at the end of their economic lives).  Citing Crowley for the \nproposition that while “agencies’ nonenforcement decisions are generally unreviewable . . . , an \nagency’s adoption of a general enforcement policy is subject to review,” the court concluded that \nthe Maritime Administration’s policy was not presumptively unreviewable because it was not a \n“single-shot non-enforcement decision.”  Id. at 812 (citation omitted).     \nThe government contends that Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability applies here.  See \nPrinceton MTD at 17.  Like the FDA’s refusal to take the enforcement actions at issue in Chaney, \nthe government argues, DHS’s decision to rescind a deferred-action policy like DACA involves a \n“complicated balancing” of the agency’s enforcement and resource-allocation priorities, and it \nresembles the “[c]hanges in policy as to criminal prosecutorial discretion” that “regularly occur \nwithin and between presidential administrations.”  Defs.’ Reply at 2–3, 26.  Moreover, the \nSupreme Court has said that the concerns that counsel against judicial review in the criminal \ncontext are “greatly magnified in the deportation context,” where delaying removal “is often the \nprincipal object of resistance to a deportation proceeding” and where delays “permit and prolong \na continuing violation” of the federal immigration laws.  AAADC, 525 U.S. at 490.  Nor do \nCrowley and OSG apply here, the government argues, because those cases involved an agency’s \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 27 of 60\ninterpretation of a specific statutory provision, whereas this case involves the agency’s evaluation \nof its overall statutory authority.     \nPlaintiffs resist the application of Chaney’s presumption on two grounds.  First, they argue, \nChaney itself involved a decision not to enforce a statute, whereas DACA’s rescission was, in \nessence, a decision to resume enforcing the immigration laws.  Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to \nDismiss (“Pls.’ Opp’n”) [ECF No. 23] at 6.  This matters because two of Chaney’s reasons for its \npresumption apply “unique[ly] to non-enforcement decisions”: the absence of the exercise of \n“coercive power” over any person, and the lack of any “focus for judicial review.”  Id. \nThis distinction is unpersuasive.  For one thing, the rescission of DACA does not actually \nrequire the Department to initiate removal proceedings against any specific alien; rather, it simply \nremoves a mechanism by which certain aliens otherwise could have been considered for deferred \naction.  Thus, like the FDA’s nonenforcement decision in Chaney, there are no agency proceedings \nhere to provide a “focus for judicial review,” 470 U.S. at 832, and DACA’s rescission does not \nitself involve the exercise of coercive power over any person.14   \nMoreover, Chaney’s remaining rationales apply here with equal force.  An agency’s \ndecision  to  revoke  a  nonenforcement  policy  involves  the  same  prioritization  and  resource-\nallocation considerations as its decision to implement such a policy.   See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831.  \n                                                 \n14 True, there is an element of coercion in the revocation of work authorization and other benefits associated \nwith DACA.  But the revocation of those benefits is not itself an enforcement decision and is therefore not properly \nanalyzed under Chaney.  See 470 U.S. at 832.  Indeed, at least one other court has concluded that the withholding of \nwork authorization and similar discretionary benefits is unreviewable under § 701(a)(2) simply because “[t]here are \nno statutory standards . . . to apply.”  See Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1048 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that \n§ 701(a)(2) precluded review of a categorical refusal by a district office of the then-Immigration and Naturalization \nService to grant work authorization and pre-hearing voluntary departure to a certain class of eligible aliens over a \nthree-year period); cf. Texas, 809 F.3d at 166–68 (holding that conferring such benefits, especially “in light of the \nINA’s intricate regulatory scheme for changing immigration classifications and issuing employment authorization,” \nwas a nondiscretionary determination sufficient to permit APA review).   \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 28 of 60\nAnd both types of decisions are substantially immunized from judicial review in the criminal \ncontext.  See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (“[T]he decision whether or \nnot  to  prosecute . . . generally  rests  entirely  in  [the  prosecutor’s]  discretion[,] . . .  subject  to \nconstitutional constraints.” (citations omitted)).  Thus, although the D.C. Circuit has at times \nwarned against extending Chaney “outside of [the] context” of “decisions not to take enforcement \naction,” Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (rejecting Chaney’s application to a \ndecision to withhold federal funding from a homeless shelter), this Court has little difficulty \nconcluding that Chaney extends to the revocation of nonenforcement decisions. \nSecond, plaintiffs contend that under Crowley and OSG, any general enforcement policy \nis exempt from Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability, regardless of whether it is premised on \na legal interpretation.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 7; Tr. Of Mots. Hr’g [ECF No. 64] (“Oral Arg. Tr.”) at \n21:6–11.  Concededly, there is some language in the post-Crowley case law to support this view.  \nSee, e.g., OSG, 132 F.3d at 812 (stating that “an agency’s adoption of a general enforcement policy \nis subject to review”); Ass’n of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 283 F.3d \n339, 343 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting “our assumption in Crowley that a district court might have \njurisdiction over an agency’s articulation of its general enforcement policy”).   \nBut plaintiffs’ reading of this language is unpersuasive for at least two reasons.  First, it is \nin substantial tension with Chaney itself, where the plaintiffs had asked the FDA to take “various \ninvestigatory and enforcement actions” against drug manufacturers, state prisons, and “all those in \nthe chain of distribution who knowingly distribute or purchase the drugs [at issue] with intent to \nuse them for human execution.”  470 U.S. at 824; see id. at 842 (Marshall, J., concurring in the \njudgment) (noting that “the number of people currently affected by the alleged misbranding is \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 29 of 60\naround 200”).  These facts suggest that the FDA’s refusal to act in that case was more than just a \none-off nonenforcement decision.15  Second, plaintiffs’ broad reading of Crowley and OSG is \nunnecessary to support the holdings of those cases, which both involved nonenforcement decisions \nbased solely on agency statutory interpretation.  See Crowley, 37 F. 3d at 672–73; OSG, 132 F.3d \nat 810  Better, then, to adhere to the lines that the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court have actually \ndrawn:  between  legal  interpretations  couched  as  broad  enforcement  policies  (which  are \nreviewable, as in OSG), individual enforcement decisions (which are presumptively unreviewable, \nas in Crowley), and discretionary enforcement policies (which are presumptively unreviewable, as \nin Chaney itself). \nIndeed, the government’s reading of Crowley and OSG proceeds essentially along these \nlines.  In the government’s view, those cases stand for the proposition that “if [an] agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute is embedded in a non-reviewable enforcement policy, the former may be \nreviewable as such,” but “the enforcement policy itself” is presumptively insulated from review.  \nDefs.’ Reply at 6 (emphasis added).  Thus, according to the government, Crowley and OSG \naddress the “flipside” of the Supreme Court’s dictum in BLE: just as an otherwise unreviewable \nagency action (like a refusal to reconsider an earlier decision, as in BLE, or a nonenforcement \ndecision, as in Chaney and Crowley) does not become reviewable simply because the agency acts \non the basis of its interpretation of a statute, an otherwise reviewable interpretation of a statute \ndoes not become presumptively unreviewable simply because the agency characterizes it as an \nexercise of enforcement discretion.  See Oral Arg. Tr. at 15:5–13.  \n                                                 \n15 Justice Brennan joined the Court’s opinion on the understanding that it applied only to “[i]ndividual, \nisolated nonenforcement decisions.”  Id. at 839 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Seven other justices joined the majority \nopinion in full, however, and none of them took Justice Brennan’s view.   \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 30 of 60\nThe Court has no quarrel with this statement of the law as a general matter, but it is \nunpersuaded by the government’s attempt to apply that law to this case.  The government contends \nthat the Crowley/OSG exception does not apply here because the Rescission Memo “does not \ncontain an embedded interpretation of the INA (or any other statute).”  Defs.’ Reply at 6.  But the \nSessions Letter makes clear that DACA’s rescission was based (at least in significant part) on the \nAttorney General’s view that the program lacked “proper statutory authority.”  AR 251.   \nAs best the Court can tell, the government’s response is that Crowley and OSG are \ndistinguishable because they involved an agency’s determination that a specific statutory provision \napplied to a particular course of conduct, whereas this case—like Chaney—involves an agency’s \ndetermination as to the scope of its statutory (and here, also constitutional) authority.  See Oral \nArg. Tr. at 57:24–58:9 (arguing that Crowley applies only “where there’s an interpretation of a \nsubstantive provision of the statute”); id. at 8:12–15 (“Plaintiffs nowhere point to any provision in \nthe INA that would substantively constrain the Secretary’s decision . . . to rescind or discontinue \nDACA.”).  But this strikes the Court as a distinction without a difference.  To say that a particular \nagency  action  is  “without  statutory  authority”  is  simply  to  say  that  no  statutory  provision \nauthorizes that action; in a sense, therefore, it is a determination of the substantive content of each \nstatutory provision that might plausibly apply.  See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (authorizing the \nDepartment to “[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies and priorities”).  The \nCourt fails to perceive any meaningful difference between an agency’s conclusion that it lacks \nstatutory authority and its interpretation of a specific statutory provision.  See City of Arlington v. \nFCC, 569 U.S. 290, 299–300 (2013) (rejecting, for purposes of determining the proper standard of \njudicial review, a similar distinction between “jurisdictional” and “nonjurisdictional” agency \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 31 of 60\ninterpretations and concluding that “there is no difference, insofar as the validity of agency action \nis concerned, between an agency’s exceeding the scope of its authority (its ‘jurisdiction’) and its \nexceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has”).  The government’s \nattempt to avoid Crowley and OSG on these grounds therefore fails. \nThe government’s reliance on BLE is equally unavailing.  For one thing, as Crowley \nrecognized, BLE addressed the reviewability of enforcement decisions only in dictum; its actual \nholding concerned the reviewability of an agency’s refusal to reconsider a prior decision.  See \nCrowley, 37 F.3d at 676; BLE, 482 U.S. at 278–84.  Moreover, the best account of BLE is the one \nthat the D.C. Circuit actually gave in Crowley, where the court relied on BLE to conclude that \nChaney’s presumption of unreviewability applies to individual nonenforcement decisions.  See \nCrowley, 37 F.3d at 676–77.  In the same breath, however, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed its view \nthat general enforcement policies are exempt from Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability \nwhere they are predicated solely on the agency’s view of what the law requires.  See id.  This \ntreatment of BLE by the Crowley court is not only sensible—after all, BLE’s dictum concerned a \nprosecutor’s decision not to bring a single criminal charge—but it is also binding on this Court.   \nNor do the concerns that counsel against judicial review in the immigration context carry \nmuch force where, as here, a party seeks judicial review of a legal judgment embedded in an \nimmigration enforcement policy.  Unlike judicial review of individual removal proceedings, \nreview of an enforcement policy does not itself delay the removal of any specific alien.  See \nAAADC, 525 U.S. at 490–91 (noting that delay “is often the principal object of resistance to a \ndeportation proceeding” and that it prolongs “an ongoing violation of United States law”).  And \nthere is no danger of “chilling law enforcement by subjecting the [agency’s] motives . . . to outside \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 32 of 60\ninquiry,” since the court need only examine the immigration authority’s legal reasoning.  Id. at 490 \n(alteration omitted).  Although many immigration decisions touch on subjects that courts are ill-\nequipped  to  consider,  such  as  diplomacy  or  national  security,  see  id.  at  491,  an  agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute is a much more natural subject for judicial review.  Thus, while \nimmigration  policies  are  generally  “so  exclusively  entrusted  to  the  political  branches  of \ngovernment as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference,” there are good reasons \nto scrutinize a policy more carefully when it is based solely on an agency’s reading of domestic \nstatutory law.  Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1999). \nProperly  understood,  then,  the  Crowley/OSG  exception  to  Chaney’s  presumption  of \nunreviewability applies to a legal interpretation phrased as a general enforcement policy, even if \nthat interpretation concerns the scope of the agency’s lawful enforcement authority.  And that is \nessentially what we have here.   \nBut the government has one final line of defense.  According to the government, DACA \nwas rescinded not only because of its supposed illegality, but also because of the Attorney \nGeneral’s assessment of what the government now calls “litigation risk”—that is, the likelihood \nthat DACA would have been invalidated had it been challenged in the Texas litigation.  See Defs.’ \nReply at 17; AR 254–55.  At first blush, this seems to be a “discretionary” consideration that makes \nthis case more like Chaney, where the agency refused to take enforcement action not only because \nit thought that it lacked jurisdiction (a legal reason), but also because the alleged violations did not \nimplicate the agency’s enforcement priorities (a discretionary reason).  See 470 U.S. at 824–25.   \nIt is not difficult to imagine a case where a court’s preliminary disapproval of an agency’s \nnonenforcement policy could lead the agency to rescind that policy for bona fide discretionary \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 33 of 60\nreasons.  See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831 (identifying “whether the agency is likely to succeed if it \nacts” as one of several such reasons).  For example, the agency could conclude that the costs of \ndefending the policy in court would outweigh its benefits to the public, or that the negative \npublicity that would surround the litigation would undermine the policy’s effectiveness.  In such \ncases, the decision to rescind would be “discretionary” in a meaningful sense: the agency would \nhave weighed the policy’s costs and benefits and decided that the former outweighed the latter.  \nBut where an agency asserts that a nonenforcement policy is unlawful and then asserts \n“litigation risk” as a separate ground for the policy’s rescission, there are reasons to be more \nsuspicious.  After all, if an agency could insulate from judicial review any legal interpretation \nsimply by framing it as an enforcement policy and then offering as an additional, “discretionary” \njustification the assertion that a court would likely agree with the agency’s interpretation, then \nCrowley would be a dead letter.  Moreover, because such an assertion would depend (at least in \npart) on the correctness of the agency’s view of the policy’s unlawfulness, it would be unlike the \nindependent discretionary ground that triggered the presumption of unreviewability in Chaney \nitself.  See 470 U.S. at 824–25 (noting the FDA’s statement that even if it had jurisdiction, it would \nstill decline to act pursuant to its “inherent discretion to decline to pursue certain enforcement \nmatters”).  For these reasons, litigation-strategy justifications deserve closer scrutiny when they \nare accompanied by agency assertions of unlawfulness.  \nHere, the Department rescinded DACA for legal reasons—its purported statutory and \nconstitutional defects—and then offered as an additional reason the fact that a federal court of \nappeals had held that DAPA, a related but distinct deferred-action program, likely suffered from \nsimilar defects.  See Defs.’ Reply at 17 (citing the “litigation risk posed by the proceedings in \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 34 of 60\nTexas and the consequent potential for massive disruption were the policy [to be] immediately \nenjoined”).  Although this additional justification was not a bare assertion that a court would likely \nagree with the agency’s view of the law—since it relied on an actual court’s view of a concededly \nsimilar legal issue—it nonetheless raises many of the same concerns.  The Crowley/OSG rule \nwould be seriously undermined if an agency could insulate from judicial review any legal \ninterpretation stated as a general enforcement policy simply by pointing to one case where one \ncourt tentatively agreed with the agency on a similar legal issue.  Moreover, the Department’s \nconclusion that the Fifth Circuit’s decision to uphold a preliminary injunction of DAPA suggests \nthat a court would likely also impose a preliminary injunction of DACA necessarily relies on the \nDepartment’s  legal  analysis  of  the  similarities  between  the  two  policies—which,  like  the \nDepartment’s view of DACA’s legality itself, does not qualify for Chaney’s presumption of \nunreviewability.  Thus, the Court concludes that the Department’s litigation-risk justification was \ntoo closely bound up with its evaluation of DACA’s legality to trigger Chaney’s presumption of \nunreviewability here.   \nWhen  the  litigation-risk  justification  falls  away,  all  that  is  left  to  support  DACA’s \nrescission is the Department’s determination that the program was implemented without proper \nstatutory and constitutional authority—a legal determination which, when made in the context of \na general enforcement policy, is not subject to Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability.  Thus, \nlike every other court that has considered the question thus far, the Court concludes that DACA’s \nrescission was not “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see Regents, \n279 F. Supp. 3d at 1029–31; Batalla Vidal, 2017 WL 5201116, at *9–12; Casa De Maryland, 284 \nF. Supp. 3d at 770.  The Court will therefore proceed to the merits of plaintiffs’ APA claims. \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 35 of 60\n*  *  *  \nTo  summarize:  an  agency’s  decision  whether  to  take  an  enforcement  action  is \npresumptively unreviewable, and that presumption can normally be rebutted only by pointing to \nstatutory language that constrains the agency’s exercise of its enforcement discretion.  See Chaney, \n470 U.S. at 832–33.  Under circuit precedent, however, an enforcement decision is exempt from \nthe presumption of unreviewability if: (1) it is expressed as a general enforcement policy; and (2) \nit relies solely on the agency’s view of what the law requires.  See OSG, 132 F.3d at 812; Crowley, \n37 F.3d at 676–677.  This rule not only accords with the applicable case law, but it also preserves \nthe judiciary’s role as the ultimate arbiter of statutory meaning while at the same time affording \nagencies breathing space to adopt enforcement policies for discretionary reasons.  \nHere, DACA’s rescission was a general enforcement policy predicated on DHS’s legal \ndetermination that the program was invalid when it was adopted.  And although the government \nhas sought to cast the Department’s assessment of “litigation risk” as a discretionary justification \nthat brings this case within Chaney’s ambit, that justification is insufficiently independent from \nthe agency’s evaluation of DACA’s legality to trigger Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability.  \nThus, the Crowley/OSG exemption applies, and the government’s motions to dismiss will be \ndenied to the extent that they assert § 701(a)(2) as a bar to APA review.  \nB.  Whether Plaintiffs Possess a Cause of Action Under the APA and RFA \nThe government also argues that the non-individual plaintiffs “lack a cause of action under \nthe APA” because they “cannot meet the zone-of-interest test” used to determine prudential \nstanding.  Defs.’ Reply at 13–14; see also NAACP MTD at 18 (framing this argument as one of \n“prudential standing”).  However, “[f]or each claim, if constitutional and prudential standing can \nbe shown for at least one plaintiff, [the Court] need not consider the standing of the other plaintiffs \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 36 of 60\nto raise that claim.”  Mt. States Legal Found. v. Glickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \nThus, because it is undisputed that Ms. Perales Sanchez’s interests fall within the zone regulated \nby the INA,16 the Court need not consider prudential standing in Princeton.  And the NAACP \nplaintiffs have prudential standing for essentially the same reason as Ms. Perales Sanchez: each \nhas members who are DACA beneficiaries and whose interests consequently fall within the zone \nof interests regulated by the INA.  See Hodel, 840 F.2d at 61 (concluding that, “[f]or similar \nreasons [that the court found Article III standing], the interests of [the association’s] members also \nfall within the zone of interests protected by the Endangered Species Act”).   \nThe NAACP plaintiffs’ RFA claims are another matter.  See NAACP FAC 75–82 (alleging \nthat the Department failed to conduct an analysis of the effect of DACA’s rescission on “small \nentities,” as required by the RFA).  “The RFA provides that ‘a small entity that is adversely \naffected or aggrieved by final agency action is entitled to judicial review . . . .’”  Nw. Min. Ass’n \nv. Babbitt, 5 F. Supp. 2d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 1998) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 611(a)(1)); see also 5 U.S.C. \n§ 601(6) (defining a “small entity” to mean, as relevant here, a “small organization”); id. § 601(4) \n(defining a “small organization” to be “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned \nand operated and is not dominant in its field”).  Given this statutory language, “the RFA extends \nstanding to seek judicial review only to a ‘small entity.’”  Babbitt, 5 F. Supp. 2d at 13.  But as the \ngovernment points out, the NAACP plaintiffs’ complaint “contains only a single conclusory \nallegation that [they] fall within the statutory definition, and any factual support for that claim is \n                                                 \n16 Nor could there be any dispute.  As a DACA beneficiary, Ms. Perales Sanchez is “[her]self the subject of \nthe contested regulatory action.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987) (“The ‘zone of interest’ test \nis a guide for deciding whether . . . a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency \ndecision. . . . [It] denies a right of review if the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.”).  \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 37 of 60\nmissing from (and arguably contradicted by) the declarations submitted in support of their motion \nfor summary judgment.”  Defs.’ Reply at 14 (citation omitted) (quoting Princeton MSJ, Ex. R at \n2595 [ECF No. 28-17] (declaration from the president of the AFT, stating that “[t]he AFT is a \nnational labor union representing approximately 1.7 million members”); id. at 2618  (declaration \nfrom the president of the NAACP, stating that “[t]he NAACP is the nation’s largest . . . civil rights \norganization”); id. at 2639–40 (declaration from the president of the UFCW, stating that the union \n“is a labor organization” representing “1.3 million members”)).  Thus, the NAACP plaintiffs have \nnot established prudential standing on their RFA claim, and that claim will be dismissed. \nC.  Procedural Validity \nThe Court turns now to the merits of plaintiffs’ administrative claims, beginning with their \nargument that DACA’s rescission should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking.  The \nAPA generally requires notice-and-comment procedures whenever an agency creates, amends, or \nrepeals a rule.17  See 5 U.S.C §§ 551(5), 553(b)–(c).  A rule is exempt from this requirement, \nhowever, if it is an “interpretative rule[], general statement[] of policy, or rule[] of agency \norganization, procedure, or practice.”  Id. § 553(b)(A).  Here, plaintiffs assert that DACA’s \nrescission  was  a  “substantive”  or  “legislative”  rule  that  should  have  undergone  notice  and \ncomment, Princeton MSJ at 38–41, while the government contends that DACA’s rescission was \n“a general statement of policy regarding how DHS will exercise its enforcement discretion,” Defs.’ \nReply at 27.  On this point, the government has the better of the argument.  Accord Regents, 2018 \n                                                 \n17 The parties do not dispute that DACA’s rescission is a “rule” for APA purposes.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) \n(defining a “rule,” in relevant part, as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability \nand future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, \nor practice requirements of an agency”); see also Texas, 809 F.3d at 171 n.122 (noting that the government likewise \ndid not dispute that DAPA was a rule).   \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 38 of 60\nWL 401177, at *2 (dismissing the notice-and-comment challenge to DACA’s rescission); Batalla \nVidal, 2018 WL 1532370, at *5–6 (same); Casa De Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 772 (same). \nThe key question in distinguishing between legislative rules (which must undergo notice \nand comment) and general statements of policy (which need not) is whether the statement in \nquestion has a “present binding effect.”  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. (EPIC) v. DHS, 653 F.3d 1, 7 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011).  “An agency pronouncement will be considered binding as a practical matter if \nit either appears on its face to be binding, or is applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is \nbinding.”  Id. (citation omitted); see Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 197 (describing general statements of \npolicy as “statements issued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in \nwhich the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power” (citation omitted)). \nPlaintiffs contend that DACA’s rescission has a present binding effect because it “presently \nbars DACA beneficiaries from obtaining advance parole or applying to renew DACA relief” and \n“presently  bars  DHS  officials  from  exercising  their  prior  discretion  in  reviewing  DACA \napplications or advance-parole applications.”  Princeton MSJ at 40.  But this characterization of \nDACA’s rescission is misleading.  The Rescission Memo states the Department’s intent to “reject \nall  DACA  initial  requests”  filed  after  September  5,  2017  and  “not  [to]  approve  any \nnew . . . applications for advance parole,” AR 255; thus, its binding effect is “prospective[],” \nLincoln, 508 U.S. at 197 (citation omitted), rather than “present,” EPIC, 653 F.3d at 7 (citation \nomitted).18  Moreover, the memo expressly states that it places “no limitations . . . on the otherwise \nlawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS,” AR 255, which further suggests that it is \n                                                 \n18 Although technically the memo does “presently bar DHS officials” from considering DACA and advance-\nparole applications, Princeton MSJ at 40, this argument proves too much.  Any general statement of agency policy \nwill presently bind the agency’s employees; the question, rather, is whether the statement “purport[s] to bind those \nsubject to it.”  EPIC, 653 F.3d at 7 (citation omitted).  The Rescission Memo does not.   \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 39 of 60\nwithout present binding effect, cf. McLouth Steel Products Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317, 1319 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (“If a statement denies the decisionmaker discretion . . . so that he, she, or they \nwill automatically decline to entertain challenges to the statement’s position, then the statement is \nbinding . . . .”).  \nFinally, the fact remains that the Rescission Memo withdrew a prior memorandum, which \nwas itself issued without notice and comment, regarding how DHS intended to “exercise [its] \nprosecutorial discretion.”  AR 1.  The Rescission Memo is therefore a clear example of a \n“statement[] by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency \nproposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 197 (citation omitted); see \nRegents, 2018 WL 401177, at *2 (“For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed \nno notice and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.”).  Hence, the rescission of \nDACA was exempt from notice and comment as a general statement of agency policy.19 \nD.  Substantive Validity \nThe  APA  provides  that  a  court  “shall . . . hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency \naction . . . found  to  be . . . arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  To satisfy this standard, an agency must “examine \nthe relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \n                                                 \n19 Plaintiffs also argue that DACA’s rescission “‘alter[s] the rights or interests of parties’” (and hence is not \na rule of “agency organization, procedure, or practice”) and “makes a ‘substantive change’ to the statutory or \nregulatory regime” (and hence is not an interpretive rule).  Princeton MSJ at 39–40 (quoting EPIC, 653 F.3d at 5–7).  \nThe government does not contend that DACA falls under either of these alternative exceptions to the notice-and-\ncomment requirement, however, and the Court therefore will not address these arguments.  \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 40 of 60\nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  “[I]f an agency relies on two grounds for a decision, a court \nmay sustain it if one is valid and if the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if the \nother were unavailable.”  Syracuse Peace Council v. FCC, 867 F.2d 654, 657 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nHowever, because “a reviewing court . . . must judge the propriety of [agency] action solely by the \ngrounds invoked by the agency,” post hoc explanations that the agency did not articulate when it \nacted are insufficient.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947). \nHere, the Department never stated, and the government does not now contend, that \nDACA’s  rescission  reflected  a  change  in  the  agency’s  immigration  enforcement  priorities.  \nInstead, the government points to two reasons for DACA’s rescission: first, the Department’s legal \nconclusion that DACA was unconstitutional and without statutory authority; and second, its \nassessment of what it now calls “litigation risk”—the likelihood that DACA would have been \nabruptly enjoined in the Texas litigation.  Because these were the only reasons given by the agency, \nDACA’s rescission can be sustained only on those grounds, even if the agency could have validly \nrescinded DACA as an exercise of its enforcement discretion.  See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Dep’t \nof Transp., 137 F.3d 640, 646 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (“An agency action, however permissible as an \nexercise of discretion, cannot be sustained ‘where it is based not on the agency’s own judgment \nbut on an erroneous view of the law.’” (citation omitted)).  \n1.  The Department’s Conclusion that DACA Was Unlawful  \n Plaintiffs first attack DHS’s reliance on DACA’s purported unlawfulness as a reason to \nrescind DACA.  They argue both that DHS failed adequately to explain its legal conclusion, see \nPrinceton MSJ at 11–17, and that even if DHS’s explanation were adequate, its conclusion was \nerroneous, see id. at 17–27.  The Court agrees that DHS’s decision was inadequately explained, \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 41 of 60\nand hence it need not address the alternative argument that DHS’s conclusion was substantively \nincorrect. \n “One of the basic procedural requirements of administrative rulemaking is that an agency \nmust give adequate reasons for its decisions.”  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125.  Thus, when \nan agency reverses a prior decision, it must “provide a reasoned explanation for the change.”  Id.  \nThat explanation need not be “more detailed . . . than what would suffice for a new policy created \non  a  blank  slate,”  but it  must  address  the  “facts  and  circumstances  that  underlay  or  were \nengendered by the prior policy,” including any “serious reliance interests.”  Id. at 2125–26 (quoting \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)); see also id. at 2126 (“[A]n \n‘unexplained inconsistency’ in agency policy ‘is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an \narbitrary and capricious change . . . .’” (alterations and citation omitted)).   \nIn concluding that DACA was unlawful, DHS purported to identify both statutory and \nconstitutional defects with the program.  For its part, the Rescission Memo pointed to “the Supreme \nCourt’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings” in the Texas litigation and then cited the Sessions Letter, \nsee AR 255, which stated that “DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through \nexecutive  action, without proper statutory authority and  with no established end-date,  after \nCongress’s repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar \nresult.”  AR 251.  The Sessions Letter also stated that “[s]uch an open-ended circumvention of the \nimmigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch,” and \nlater, in its concluding paragraph, it cited the Executive’s duty to “faithfully execute the laws \npassed by Congress.”   Id.  It also opined that “the DACA policy has the same legal and \nconstitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  Id. \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 42 of 60\nThis scant legal reasoning was insufficient to satisfy the Department’s obligation to explain \nits departure from its prior stated view that DACA was lawful.  In concluding that DACA was \nimplemented “without statutory authority,” neither the Sessions Letter nor the Rescission Memo \ncited any statutory provision with which DACA was in conflict.  Cf. Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. \nat 2127 (rejecting as inadequate an agency’s statement that a particular statutory exemption “does \nnot include [certain] positions and the [agency] recognizes that there are circumstances under \nwhich the requirements for the exemption would not be met”).  True, both documents pointed to \nthe Fifth Circuit’s decision in Texas, which held that DAPA likely conflicted with the INA’s \n“intricate  process for illegal  aliens to derive a  lawful immigration  classification from their \nchildren’s  immigration  status.”    Texas,  809  F.3d  at  179.    But  the  government  does  not \nmeaningfully dispute that, unlike DAPA, “DACA has ‘no analogue in the INA.’”  Defs.’ Reply at \n22 (quoting Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1042).  Thus, the Fifth Circuit’s statutory analysis is \ninapposite.20  The Department’s conclusion that DACA was implemented without statutory \nauthority—based only on an incongruous reference to the Fifth Circuit’s decision on DAPA—\ntherefore cannot support the program’s rescission.  \n                                                 \n20 The Fifth Circuit also concluded that “there was evidence from DACA’s implementation that DAPA’s \ndiscretionary language was pretextual.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 173; see id. at 172–176 (upholding the district court’s \nfactual finding that although “the DACA Memo instructed agencies to review applications on a case-by-case basis \nand  exercise  discretion,  .  .  .  those  statements  were  ‘merely  pretext’  because  only  about  5%  of  [DACA] \napplications . . . had been denied” and because the government could not identify how many of those had been denied \nfor discretionary reasons (footnote omitted)).  But the Fifth Circuit relied on that finding only to conclude that DAPA \nshould have been promulgated using notice-and-comment rulemaking, not that it conflicted substantively with the \nINA.  See id. at 171–178.  And although OLC had orally advised the Department that “it was critical that, like past \npolicies that made deferred action available to certain classes of aliens, the DACA program require immigration \nofficials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action \nautomatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria,” AR 21 n.8, neither the Rescission Memo \nnor the Sessions Letter identified this purported flaw as a reason for DACA’s invalidity.  \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 43 of 60\nThe Department’s explanation for its conclusion that DACA was unconstitutional was \nequally opaque.  The Sessions Letter made a fleeting reference to the Attorney General’s “duty \nto . . . faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress,” AR 251, which could be read to invoke the \nPresident’s constitutional duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  See U.S. Const. \nart. II, § 3.  But the letter made no attempt to explain why DACA breached that duty.21  This failure \nwas particularly acute in light of a thirty-three page memorandum prepared in 2014 by the Office \nof Legal Counsel (“OLC”), which deduced “from the nature of the Take Care duty” no fewer than \n“four general . . . principles governing the permissible scope of enforcement discretion” and \nconcluded that DAPA, a similar deferred-action program, was consistent with all of them.  AR 9–\n10,  14–36.22    And  although  the  Sessions  Letter  asserted  that  DACA suffered  from  “the \nsame . . . constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA,” AR 251, the Fifth Circuit’s \ndecision in Texas did not actually identify any such defects.  Indeed, it expressly declined to \naddress the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  See 809 F.3d at 146 n.3.  Like its evaluation of its \nstatutory  authority  to  implement  DACA,  then,  the  Department’s  analysis  of  DACA’s \nconstitutionality was so barebones that the Court cannot “discern[]” the “path” that the agency \n                                                 \n21 At least one commentator has identified a second possible constitutional argument in the Sessions Letter: \n“The  Obama  administration’s  open-ended  reading  of  certain  definitional  provisions  of  the  Immigration  and \nNationality Act (INA) would run afoul of the nondelegation doctrine.”  See Josh Blackman, Understanding Sessions’s \nJustification to Rescind DACA, Lawfare (Jan. 16, 2018, 8:00 AM) https://www.lawfareblog.com/understanding-\nsessionss-justification-rescind-daca; see also Texas, 809 F.3d at 150 (noting that the plaintiffs there had asserted \n“constitutional claims under the Take Care Clause” and the “separation of powers doctrine”).  The government does \nnot raise these arguments, however, so the Court will not consider them.   \n22 The OLC memorandum did not directly address the Department’s authority to implement DACA.  See AR \n5–14 (discussing the agency’s authority to “prioritize the removal of certain categories of aliens over others”); AR \n14–36 (discussing the agency’s authority to implement DAPA).  However, the memo did state that OLC had “orally \nadvised” the Department that DACA was lawful so long as “immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each \napplication on an individualized basis.”  AR 21 n.8 (“[T]he concerns animating DACA were . . . consistent with the \ntypes of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration enforcement discretion.”). \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 44 of 60\nfollowed.  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citation omitted).23  Thus, it too cannot support \nDACA’s rescission. \nThe Department’s failure to give an adequate explanation of its legal judgment was \nparticularly egregious here in light of the reliance interests involved.  See Encino Motorcars, 136 \nS. Ct. at 2126.  The Rescission Memo made no mention of the fact that DACA had been in place \nfor five years and had engendered the reliance of hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, many of \nwhom had structured their education, employment, and other life activities on the assumption that \nthey would be able to renew their DACA benefits.24  The Supreme Court has set aside changes in \nagency policy for failure to consider reliance interests that pale in comparison to the ones at stake \nhere.  See, e.g., Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (setting aside the Department of Labor’s \ninterpretation  of  a  statutory  exemption  from  the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act’s  overtime-pay \nrequirements, in part because the agency had failed to address “decades of industry reliance” on \nits prior view that the exemption applied to a particular class of employees).  Because DHS failed \n                                                 \n23 Neither Encino Motorcars nor any of its predecessor cases explicitly required an agency to address its prior \nviews on the legality of its prior policy.  See, e.g., Fox, 556 U.S. at 515 (explaining that “[a]n agency may \nnot . . . depart from a prior policy sub silentio” (first emphasis added)).  But where, as here, the OLC provides an \nagency with an opinion that suggests a legal framework for evaluating the legality of a particular program and the \nagency later rescinds that policy on legal grounds, failure to even consider OLC’s thorough analysis is arbitrary and \ncapricious.  See Trevor W. Morrison, Stare Decisis in the Office of Legal Counsel, 110 Colum. L. Rev. 1448, 1464 \n(2010) (“OLC’s legal advice is treated as binding within the Executive Branch until withdrawn or overruled.”); \nHispanic Affairs Project v. Acosta, 263 F. Supp. 3d 160, 178 (D.D.C. 2017) (concluding that an “agency’s non-\nconsideration of [certain] OLC memoranda—whether deliberate or inadvertent—is all the more reason to consider \nthem in reviewing the agency’s action,” because “[a] contrary result would permit agencies to toss aside OLC \nmemoranda that contain legal conclusions contrary to the agency’s preferred policy choices”). \n24 See, e.g., Perales Decl. ¶¶ 21–22 (if DACA were rescinded, Ms. Perales Sanchez would have to abandon \nher plans of conducting postgraduate research in Mexico and then applying to law school, because she could no longer \ntravel abroad, take out student loans, or work lawfully in the United States);  Decl. of Jane Doe #2, Ex. S to Princeton \nMSJ [ECF No. 28-17] ¶¶ 11–13 (current special education teacher and DACA beneficiary would lose her job and \nwould have to abandon her plans of pursuing a doctorate in audiology);  Decl. of Jane Doe #5, Ex. X to Princeton \nMSJ [ECF No. 28-17] ¶ 11 (current undergraduate student and DACA beneficiary would have to abandon her plans \nof attending law school). Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file pseudonymous declarations with their summary \njudgment motion.  See Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to Allow Three Declarants to Proceed by Pseudonym [ECF No. 22].  The \ngovernment did not oppose the motion, so the Court will treat it as conceded and grant it.  See Local Civ. R. 7(b).  \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 45 of 60\nto even acknowledge how heavily DACA beneficiaries had come to rely on the expectation that \nthey would be able to renew their DACA benefits, its barebones legal interpretation was doubly \ninsufficient and cannot support DACA’s rescission.   \n2.  Litigation Risk \nThe Department’s second justification for DACA’s rescission was its conclusion that, if \nDACA were challenged in the Texas litigation, the district court there would enter a “nationwide \ninjunction” that “would have prompted an immediate—and chaotic—end to the policy.”  Defs.’ \nReply at 15.  Plaintiffs contend that this “litigation risk” conclusion was arbitrary and capricious \nand hence cannot sustain DACA’s rescission.  Princeton MSJ at 28–36.  They are correct. \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs assert that the government’s litigation-risk argument is an \n“impermissible  post  hoc  rationalization”  of  the  Department’s  decision  to  rescind  DACA.  \nPrinceton MSJ at 28.  Here, plaintiffs miss the mark.  Although both the Rescission Memo and the \nSessions Letter focused primarily on DACA’s statutory and constitutional defects, the Sessions \nLetter did state that DAPA was “enjoined on a nationwide basis” and that “it is likely that \npotentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.”  AR 251.  \nMoreover, the Rescission Memo went on to cite this concern as grounds for its decision to “wind \n[DACA] down in an efficient and orderly manner.”  AR 254.  Together, these statements were \nsufficient to express the Department’s concern that a nationwide injunction in the Texas litigation \nwould abruptly shut down the DACA program.  See Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196. \nNevertheless, this concern does not withstand review under the familiar arbitrary and \ncapricious standard.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  First, as already noted, there was good reason \nto doubt that the second of the Fifth Circuit’s holdings in Texas—that DAPA conflicted with the \nexpress provisions of the INA, see 809 F.3d at 178–86—would extend to DACA, because the INA \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 46 of 60\ndoes not prescribe a statutory naturalization process for DACA-eligible individuals.  And although \nthe Fifth Circuit’s holding that DAPA should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking \nlikely would have extended to DACA,25 see id. at 170–78, it simply does not follow that the district \ncourt in Texas was likely to issue an injunction bringing DACA to an abrupt halt.  \nFor one thing, it is black-letter administrative law that when a court sets aside an agency \naction as procedurally invalid, the proper remedy is to remand the action to allow the agency an \nopportunity to conduct the required notice-and-comment procedures.  See Sugar Cane Growers \nCo-op. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 98 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (observing that “[w]e have previously \nremanded without vacating when the agency failed to follow notice-and-comment procedures”); \nC. & S.W. Services, Inc. v. EPA, 220 F.3d 683, 692 (5th Cir. 2000) (remanding without vacatur \nwhere the agency “may well be able to justify its decision . . . and it would be disruptive to vacate \n[the challenged] rule”).  It is true, as the government points out, that in Texas the district court \npreliminarily enjoined DAPA based solely on the program’s failure to have undergone notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  See Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 677.  DAPA was challenged before it took \neffect, however.  See Texas, 809 F.3d at 149.  By contrast, as of September 5, 2017 (the date by \nwhich the Texas plaintiffs had threatened to challenge DACA, see AR 239), DACA would have \nbeen in place for over five years, and hundreds of thousands of applicants would have already been \ngranted deferred action under the program.  Thus, assuming that the district court in the Texas \nlitigation would have found DACA defective only on procedural grounds (as a fair reading of the \n                                                 \n25 Because DAPA had not yet been implemented, the Fifth Circuit relied in large part on “extrapolation” from \nevidence regarding DACA’s implementation to conclude that DAPA would not “genuinely leave the agency and its \nemployees free to exercise discretion” and hence was a substantive rule that should have undergone notice and \ncomment.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 171–176.  The government is correct that “[w]hile that finding had to be ‘extrapolated’ \nto invalidate DAPA, it directly dooms DACA itself,” at least as far as notice and comment are concerned.  Defs.’ \nReply at 22 (citations omitted).  \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 47 of 60\nFifth Circuit’s opinion would suggest), it seems doubtful that the court would have preliminarily \nenjoined DACA instead of remanding it to the Department, perhaps without vacatur, to undergo \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.  \nOn the other hand, if the Texas district court were to find that DACA was substantively \ninvalid—or indeed, unconstitutional—injunctive relief rather than remand may have been the more \nlikely remedy.  But it still does not follow that the district court’s injunction would have brought \nthe DACA program to an “immediate” and “chaotic” halt.  Defs.’ Reply at 15.  As the Fifth Circuit \nhas repeatedly recognized, district courts have “broad discretion” to “fashion[] equitable relief,”  \nCrawford v. Silette, 608 F.3d 275, 278 (5th Cir. 2010), including injunctive relief, see ODonnell \nv. Harris County, 882 F.3d 528, 537 (5th Cir. 2018) (noting that a district court’s injunction is \nreviewed for abuse of discretion).  In light of this discretion, it strains credulity to suggest that the \ndistrict court would have enjoined DACA immediately and completely without allowing DHS any \nopportunity to wind the program down.  Thus, regardless of the grounds on which the district court \nin  Texas  might  have  ultimately  invalidated  DACA,  the  Department’s  insistence  that  an \n“immediate—and chaotic—end to the policy” would have resulted, Defs.’ Reply at 15, is “so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,” \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, and was therefore arbitrary and capricious.  \n*  *  * \nIf, as the Court has concluded, see supra Part II.A, an agency’s general enforcement policy \nis reviewable to the extent that it is premised on a legal judgment, it follows that the agency must \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 48 of 60\nexplain that judgment in sufficient detail to permit meaningful judicial review.26  See Encino \nMotorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2127.  Here, the Department’s conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in its view of  DACA’s lawfulness.27  Moreover, the agency’s prediction \nregarding the outcome of threatened litigation over DACA’s validity—specifically, that the district \ncourt in the Texas litigation would immediately halt the program, without any opportunity for a \nwind-down—was so implausible that it fails even under the deferential arbitrary and capricious \nstandard.  DACA’s rescission will therefore be set aside.28  \n                                                 \n26 The parties dispute the standard of review that would apply to the agency’s statutory and constitutional \nanalysis had it been adequately explained.  The government maintains that it would be reviewed for a “clear error of \njudgment”—that is, under the ordinary test for arbitrary and capricious agency action.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 \n(citation omitted); see Oral Arg. Tr. at 68:5–18.  Plaintiffs contend that review would be de novo.  See Teva Pharm. \nUSA, Inc. v. FDA, 441 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (finding agency action arbitrary and capricious where the agency \n“mistakenly thought itself bound” by certain D.C. Circuit precedent); Prill v. NLRB, 755 F.2d 941, 947 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) (“An agency decision cannot be sustained, however, where it is based not on the agency's own judgment but on \nan erroneous view of the law.”).  The district court in Batalla Vidal has suggested a third option: because “neither the \nSessions Letter nor the DACA Rescission Memo carry the ‘force of law,’” that court concluded, the Department’s \n“interpretation of the legality of the DACA program is [not] entitled to formal or controlling deference.”  Batalla \nVidal, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 421 n.9 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting Mead, 533 U.S. at 226–27).  Rather, it would be treated \nonly as persuasive.  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 234–35 (explaining that agency interpretations “contained in policy \nstatements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines” are “beyond the Chevron pale” and instead deserve “respect \nproportional to [their] ‘power to persuade’” (quoting Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000); then \nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)).  Because the Court does not reach the merits of the Department’s \nconclusions that DACA lacked statutory and constitutional authority, however, it expresses no opinion as to what \nstandard of review would apply. \n27 The district court in Casa de Maryland reached the opposite conclusion.  See 284 F. Supp. 3d at 772 (finding \nthat DHS had a “reasonable basis” to conclude that DACA was unlawful based on “the DAPA litigation, the threatened \nlegal challenge, and the Attorney General’s advisory letter”).  But that court’s brief discussion of the issue failed to \naddress the limited applicability of the Fifth Circuit’s Texas decision to DACA, the inadequacy of the Sessions Letter \nitself, DHS’s failure to address DACA beneficiaries’ reliance interests, and the implausibility of an injunction issuing \nin the Texas litigation that would put an immediate end to DACA.  Therefore, this Court respectfully disagrees with \nthe Casa de Maryland court’s analysis.   \n28  The  government  also  urges  the  Court  to  construe  the  Department’s  statement  that  DACA  was \n“unconstitutional in part because it was an ‘open-ended’ policy that closely tracked ‘proposed legislation’ that \nCongress had repeatedly rejected” as an “independent policy judgment” that “immigration decisions of [DACA’s] \nmagnitude should be left to Congress.” Defs.’ Reply at 21 (quoting AR 251 and citing Syracuse Peace Council, 867 \nF.2d at 657–58 (holding that if an agency offers two justifications for its decision, one constitutional and one \ndiscretionary, and if a court is “persuaded” that the agency would have reached the same result on discretionary \ngrounds had it “foregone its ruminations on the constitutional issue,” the court may avoid the constitutional issue and \nuphold the agency action only on the discretionary ground)).  But the government offers no support for the proposition \nthat an agency’s view as to which branch of government ought to address a particular policy issue is an assessment \nappropriately committed to the agency’s discretion.  Cf. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831 (listing such assessments). \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 49 of 60\nE.  Remedy \nHaving concluded that DACA’s rescission violated the APA, the question of remedy \nremains.  As an initial matter, the Court will reject the government’s invitation to confine its grant \nof relief strictly to the plaintiffs in this action.  See Defs.’ Reply at 44–45.  As plaintiffs point out, \nthe D.C. Circuit has previously rejected an agency’s suggestion that “the named plaintiffs alone \nshould be protected by [an] injunction,” explaining that “[w]hen a reviewing court determines that \nagency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their \napplication to the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 \nn.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit noted in Texas, the immigration context \ncounsels strongly in favor of nationwide relief: “the Constitution requires ‘an uniform Rule of \nNaturalization,’” 809 F.3d at 187 (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8), “Congress has instructed that \n‘the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,’” id. at \n187–88 (quoting Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99–603, § 115(1), 100 \nStat. 3359, 3384), “and the Supreme Court has described immigration policy as ‘a comprehensive \nand unified system,’” id. at 188 (quoting Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 401 (2012)).  \nThus, the Court concludes that nationwide relief is appropriate here.  \nThe only remaining issue, then, is what form the Court’s relief should take.  “[U]nsupported \nagency action normally warrants vacatur.”  Advocates for Highway & Auto Safety v. Fed. Motor \nCarrier Safety Admin., 429 F.3d 1136, 1151 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  But courts have discretion to \nremand without vacatur if “there is at least a serious possibility that the [agency] will be able to \nsubstantiate its decision,” and if “vacating would be disruptive.”  Radio-TV News Directors Ass’n \nv. FCC, 184 F.3d 872, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (alteration in original) (citation omitted); see Allied-\nSignal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C.

Alternatively, \na court may vacate the unlawful action but stay its order of vacatur for a limited time to allow the \nagency to attempt to cure the defects that the court has identified.  See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. \nEPA, 446 F.3d 140, 148 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (remanding to the district court with instructions to \nvacate an agency rule but noting that the district court possessed “remedial discretion . . . to stay \n[its] order on remand”); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, Civ. Action No. 16-1861 (JDB), 2018 \nWL 1568882, at *8 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2018) (vacating a rule but staying the order of vacatur until \nsuch time as the agency promulgated a replacement); see also A.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 \nF.3d 1484, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (remanding and providing for “automatic[]” vacatur unless the \nagency justified its decision within 90 days); Rodway v. USDA, 514 F.2d 809, 817–18 (D.C. Cir. \n1975) (remanding and giving the agency 120 days to complete the rulemaking process). \nHere, the first Allied-Signal factor—the seriousness of the action’s defects—favors remand \nwithout vacatur, although not unequivocally.  On the one hand, it is certainly possible that the \nDepartment could articulate a valid reason for DACA’s rescission.  For example, it could offer a \ncoherent legal argument that DACA conflicts with the INA or violates the President’s duty to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, or it could explain why, as a \nmatter of policy, DACA-eligible individuals should no longer be low-priority targets for removal.  \nAccord Batalla Vidal, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 408 (“Defendants indisputably can end the DACA \nprogram.”).  But there is some evidence in the record to suggest that the Department would not \nhave rescinded DACA but for its supposed illegality.  See, e.g., Ex. 119 to Princeton MSJ [ECF \nNo. 28-15] at 2003 (congressional testimony of DHS officials that DACA beneficiaries are “a \n50 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 51 of 60\nbenefit to the country” and that “[w]e need to regularize their status through some legal means”).  \nAnd although it seems that no court has yet passed judgment on DACA’s constitutionality, at least \none court in this district has concluded that DACA was likely “consistent with, rather than contrary \nto,  congressional  policy.”    Arpaio  v.  Obama,  27  F.  Supp.  3d  185,  208–09  (D.D.C.  2014) \n(concluding that the plaintiff’s substantive APA challenge to DACA was unlikely to succeed on \nthe merits), aff’d, 797 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (affirming only on standing grounds).  Thus, \nalthough the substantive flaws in DACA’s rescission are curable in theory, the Department may \nface practical obstacles when attempting to remedy them.  Nonetheless, there remains a “non-\ntrivial likelihood” that the agency could justify DACA’s rescission on remand, WorldCom, Inc. v. \nFCC, 288 F.3d 429, 434 (D.C. Cir. 2002), so the first Allied-Signal factor supports remand without \nvacatur.   \nThe second Allied-Signal factor—the risk of disruption—also tips slightly in favor of \nremand without vactur.  On the one hand, two courts have already preliminarily enjoined DACA’s \nrescission, see Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1047–50; Batalla Vidal, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 437–38, \nwhich suggests that vacatur would cause little disruption, at least initially.29  On the other hand, \nneither injunction applies to initial DACA applications, which the Department has stopped \naccepting.  Thus, vacating DACA’s rescission could lead to “an interim change”—an influx of \ninitial DACA applications—“that may itself be changed” if DHS later provides a sufficient \n                                                 \n29 True, both preliminary injunctions are currently the subjects of expedited appeals.  This fact actually favors \nvacatur, however, because if both injunctions are overturned, then this Court’s order of vacatur would preserve DACA \npending the Department’s revised explanation for the program’s rescission, thereby maintaining the status quo. \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 52 of 60\nexplanation for DACA’s rescission.30  Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 150–151 (citation omitted).  On \nbalance, therefore, the two Allied-Signal factors tend to favor remand without vacatur.  \nHowever, the Court is also mindful that, as several judges of the D.C. Circuit have noted, \nremand without vacatur “sometimes invites agency indifference.”  In re Core Comm’n, Inc., 531 \nF.3d 849, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Griffith, J., concurring) (urging courts “to consider the alternatives \nto the open-ended remand without vacatur”); see Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1250, \n1262–64 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (Randolph, J., concurring) (“A remand-only disposition is, in effect, an \nindefinite stay of the effectiveness of the court’s decision and agencies naturally treat it as such.”).  \nThis concern is particularly acute here, where each day that the agency delays is a day that aliens \nwho might otherwise be eligible for initial grants of DACA benefits are exposed to removal \nbecause of an unlawful agency action.  Moreover, although the preliminary injunctions in Regents \nand  Batalla  Vidal  currently  protect  aliens  who  have  already  received  DACA  grants,  those \ninjunctions are both on expedited appeals and hence could be reversed in the not-too-distant future.  \nThese concerns suggest that time is of the essence here, and the Court need not ignore this reality \nin crafting a remedy.  Cf. Rodway, 514 F.2d at 817–18 (ordering that regulations concerning the \nfood stamp system be revised “with expedition”—that is, within 120 days—because “[i]n matters \nas vital as basic nutrition there is no excuse for delay”). \n                                                 \n30 Nor would it be proper for the Court to vacate DACA’s rescission except as to initial applications.  While \na court has discretion to craft preliminary injunctive relief based on a number of equitable factors, see Winter v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 24 (2008), its discretion in fashioning administrative remedies is somewhat \nmore limited, see Harmon, 878 F.2d at 494–95 (“Courts ordinarily do not attempt, even with the assistance of agency \ncounsel, to fashion a valid regulation from the remnants of the old rule . . . [or to] draw[] a line which the agency itself \nhas never drawn.”).  Here, there is no principled basis to distinguish between initial DACA applications and renewal \napplications, since the Rescission Memo’s substantive invalidity stems chiefly from its inadequately explained \nrationale.  The Court therefore will not fashion an ad hoc order of vacatur along these lines. \n52 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 53 of 60\nIn light of the Allied-Signal factors, which tip in favor of remand without vacatur, and the \ntroubling humanitarian consequences of the delays that remedy might invite, the Court will adopt \nan intermediate course: it will vacate DACA’s rescission but stay its order of vacatur for 90 days.  \nDuring that time, the Secretary of Homeland Security or her delegate may reissue a memorandum \nrescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks  statutory  and  constitutional  authority.    Should  the  Department  fail  to  issue  such  a \nmemorandum within 90 days, however, the Rescission Memo will be vacated in its entirety, and \nthe original DACA program will be restored in full.  This means, among other things, that the \nagency will be required to resume accepting initial DACA applications and applications for \nadvanced parole.  \nIII.  CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES \nThe government has also moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the three constitutional \nclaims asserted in plaintiffs’ complaints for failure to state a claim.  See Princeton MTD 37–44; \nNAACP MTD 37–43.  Two of these claims—one grounded in equal protection, see Pls.’ Opp’n at \n24–27, and the other in due process, id. at 27–32—are challenges to DACA’s rescission itself.  The \nthird argues that the Department may not, consistent with applicable due process principles, use \nDACA  beneficiaries’  personal  identifying  information  to  initiate  immigration  enforcement \nproceedings against them, and plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to that effect.  Id. at 32–35.   \nIn light of its decision to vacate DACA’s rescission, the Court will defer ruling on the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ first two constitutional challenges.  Because plaintiffs \nhave failed to plausibly allege facts to support their information-sharing claim, however, that claim \nwill be dismissed without prejudice. \n53 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 54 of 60\nA.  Challenges to DACA’s Rescission \nAs noted, plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DACA’s rescission proceed along two \nlines.  First, plaintiffs argue that DACA’s rescission violates the equal protection guarantee of the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments, because it deprives undocumented aliens of certain benefits \nthat remain available to aliens who are lawfully present in the United States.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 24–\n27 (citing Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982); then Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996)).  Second, \nplaintiffs maintain that DACA’s rescission deprives existing DACA beneficiaries of their liberty \nand property interests in renewing their DACA benefits without due process of law.  Id. at 27–31. \nThe Court will defer ruling on the government’s motions to dismiss these two constitutional \nclaims.  To begin with, because the Court has already concluded that DACA’s rescission violates \nthe APA, it is not necessary to address plaintiffs’ constitutional claims now.  See Nw. Austin Mun. \nUtil. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 205 (2009) (noting that courts generally avoid \ndeciding constitutional issues unnecessarily); Texas, 809 F.3d at 146 n.3 (declining to reach \nplaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DAPA and instead affirming only on APA grounds).  \nMoreover, litigation over similar constitutional issues has either reached or progressed past the \nmotion-to-dismiss stage in three other cases, see Regents, 2018 WL 401177, at *2–7; Batalla \nVidal, 2018 WL 1532370, at *6–14; Casa de Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 773–777, and the Court \nis  especially  reluctant  unnecessarily  to  address  constitutional issues  that  have  already  been \nthoroughly considered by other courts.  Finally, the Department could, on remand, alter DACA’s \nrescission in ways that might affect the merits of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.31  At this stage \n                                                 \n31 For example, the Department might provide for procedures through which an existing DACA recipient \ncould contest the revocation of her DACA benefits—something that the current Rescission Memo does not do.  Such \nprocedures could, at least in theory, be relevant to plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.  \n54 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 55 of 60\nof the proceedings, then, the Court will defer ruling on the government’s motion to dismiss \nplaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to DACA’s rescission.   \nB.  Information-Sharing Claim \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction preventing DHS from sharing DACA beneficiaries’ \npersonal  information  with  immigration  enforcement  authorities  or  otherwise  using  it  for \nimmigration enforcement purposes.  See Princeton MSJ at 48–53; Pls.’ Opp’n at 32–35.  The \ngovernment has moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ information-sharing claim, arguing primarily that \nDHS had previously stated its intent not to use DACA beneficiaries’ personal information in this \nway and that plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the agency has since changed its policy.  See \nPrinceton MTD at 41–42; Defs.’ Reply at 36–37.  The government also contends that even if the \nDepartment had changed its information-sharing policy, there would be no due-process violation, \nbecause that policy has always stated that it “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any \ntime.”  Princeton MTD at 43 (citation omitted); Defs.’ Reply at 37–39 (citation omitted).   \nTo secure preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs “must establish (1) that [they are] likely \nto succeed on the merits, (2) that [they are] likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and (4) that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Here, the third and fourth prongs of this test—the \nequities and the public interest—clearly favor plaintiffs, who allege that the Department intends \nto use DACA beneficiaries’ identifying information against them despite its earlier assurances that \nit would not do so, which induced the beneficiaries to provide the information in the first place.   \nPlaintiffs have also demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits—as least as to their \nlegal theory.  Plaintiffs rely on two cases, Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965), and Raley v. \nOhio, 360 U.S. 423 (1959), for the general proposition that “[d]ue process forbids the Government \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 56 of 60\nfrom making and then breaking promises about the legal consequences of a specific action.”  \nPrinceton MSJ at 48.  In Raley, the Supreme Court found a due process violation where four \nindividuals were convicted of failing to answer questions posed by Ohio’s Un-American Activities \nCommission after the chairman of that commission had specifically represented to the individuals \nthat they could refuse to answer pursuant to a state-law privilege.  See 360 U.S. at 437–38; see \nalso id. at 438 (“[T]o sustain the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court on such a basis after the \nCommission had acted as it did would be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by \nthe State—convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was \navailable to him.”).  And in Cox, the Court, relying on Raley, held that it violated due process to \nconvict demonstrators under a statute that prohibited demonstrating “near” a courthouse where \n“the highest police officials of the city . . . in effect told the demonstrators that they could meet \nwhere they did.”  379 U.S. at 571; see also Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971) \n(recognizing a substantive due process right to enforce the terms of a plea agreement).  This \nargument is sufficiently persuasive to support preliminary injunctive relief.   \nThe sticking point here is the second prong—the likelihood of irreparable harm.  Several \nfactors convince the Court that the harm to DACA beneficiaries of having their information shared \nwith immigration enforcement authorities, though likely irreparable, is insufficiently imminent to \njustify preliminary injunctive relief.  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7–\n8 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (harm is irreparable only if it is “so ‘imminent that there is a clear and present \nneed for equitable relief . . . .’” (alterations and citation omitted)).  For one thing, the Department \nhas recently reaffirmed that its “information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it \nwas first announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017 memo starting a wind-down of the \n56 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 57 of 60\nDACA policy.”  USCIS, DHS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rejected DACA Requests Q5, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/daca2017/mail-faqs (last updated Feb. 14, 2018).32  This fact was enough \nto persuade one other district court to dismiss a similar information-sharing claim.  See Batalla \nVidal, 2018 WL 1532370, at *10–11.  On the other hand, two courts have reached the opposite \nconclusion, see Regents, 2018 WL 401177, at *4–5; Casa de Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 777–\n79, and one of those courts has already granted the injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek here, see \nAmended Order, Casa de Maryland, No. 17-cv-2942 (D. Md. Mar. 15, 2018), ECF No. 49 \n(enjoining the Department from (1) using or sharing DACA beneficiaries’ personal information \nexcept as originally specified on the DACA application forms and instructions and (2) changing \nits information-sharing policy without the Court’s preapproval).  But that injunction now in place \nfurther belies any suggestion that irreparable harm to DACA beneficiaries is imminent—their \ninformation cannot now be used as they fear.  Hence, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed \nto demonstrate that they are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief on their information-sharing \nclaim, and their motion for preliminary injunctive relief will be denied.   \nThe Court also concludes that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6).  Plaintiffs point to a discrepancy between a prior statement by the Department that DACA \nbeneficiaries’ information would be “protected from disclosure” and a later statement issued on \nthe  date  of  DACA’s  rescission  that  the  information  would  not  be  \n“proactively” provided to immigration enforcement authorities.  See Princeton Compl. ¶ 51.  Even \nif this discrepancy were sufficient to plausibly allege that DACA beneficiaries’ information has \n                                                 \n32 This document does not appear in the administrative record, but the Court takes judicial notice of it.  See \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2) (“The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because \nit . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”). \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 58 of 60\nbeen or will be used inconsistently with DHS’s stated information-sharing policy, the agency has \nsince reaffirmed its commitment to that prior policy, and the Court may take judicial notice of that \nfact in ruling on the government’s motion to dismiss.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); Vasser v. McDonald, 228 F. Supp. 3d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(“Courts may take judicial notice of matters of a general public nature without converting the \nmotion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.” (alterations and citation omitted)).33  Thus, \nthe government’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion will be granted as to plaintiffs’ information-sharing claim.   \nCONCLUSION \nExecutive Branch officials possess relatively unconstrained authority to enforce the law \nagainst certain violators but not others.  Ordinarily, the exercise of that authority is subject to \nreview not in a court of law, but rather in the court of public opinion: members of the public know \nhow their elected officials have used their enforcement powers, and they can hold those officials \naccountable by speaking out, by petitioning their representatives, or ultimately at the ballot box.  \nWhen an official claims that the law requires her to exercise her enforcement authority in a certain \nway, however, she excuses herself from this accountability.  Moreover, if her view of the law is \nincorrect, she may needlessly forego the opportunity to implement appropriate enforcement \npriorities and also to demonstrate those priorities to the public.   \n                                                 \n33 For similar reasons, the Court will not address the argument made by amici LatinoJustice PRLDEF (and \nothers) that DHS’s breach of the information-sharing policy would violate the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, \nand the agency’s own privacy rules.  See Br. of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, et al., as Amicus Curiae [ECF No. 36-2].  \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 59 of 60\nFortunately, neither Supreme Court nor D.C. Circuit precedent compels such a result.  \nRather, the cases are clear that courts have the authority to review an agency’s interpretation of the \nlaw if it is relied on to justify an enforcement policy, even when that interpretation concerns the \nlawful scope of the agency’s enforcement discretion.  See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 832–33; OSG, 132 \nF.3d at 812; Crowley, 37 F.3d at 676–77.  Under this rule, an official cannot claim that the law ties \nher hands while at the same time denying the courts’ power to unbind her.  She may escape political \naccountability or judicial review, but not both. \nHere, the Department’s decision to rescind DACA was predicated primarily on its legal \njudgment  that  the  program  was  unlawful.    That  legal  judgment  was  virtually  unexplained, \nhowever, and so it cannot support the agency’s decision.  And although the government suggests \nthat DACA’s rescission was also predicated on the Department’s assessment of litigation risk, this \nconsideration is insufficiently distinct from the agency’s legal judgment to alter the reviewability \nanalysis.  It was also arbitrary and capricious in its own right, and thus likewise cannot support the \nagency’s action.  For these reasons, DACA’s rescission was unlawful and must be set aside.   \nFor the reasons given above, then, the Court will vacate the Department’s September 5, \n2017 decision to rescind the DACA program.  The Court will stay its order of vacatur for 90 days, \nhowever, to afford DHS an opportunity to better explain its view that DACA is unlawful.  The \nCourt will also deny the government’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, its \nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs’ APA claims on reviewability grounds, and its motion to dismiss \nplaintiffs’ substantive APA claim; grant the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ procedural \nAPA claim, the NAACP plaintiffs’ RFA claim, and plaintiffs’ information-sharing claim; and \ndefer ruling on the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ remaining constitutional claims.  \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 23   Filed 04/24/18   Page 60 of 60\nFinally, the Court will also grant plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment as to their \nsubstantive APA claim, deny that motion as to their procedural APA claim, and deny their motion \nfor preliminary injunctive relief on their information-sharing claim.  A separate order has been \nissued on this date.  \n \n                        /s/                      \nJOHN D. BATES \nUnited States District Judge \nDated:  April 24, 2018 \n60 \n \n ",

In April \n2018, this Court held that decision unlawful and set it aside, concluding both that it was reviewable \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and that the reasons given to support it were \ninadequate.  See NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 249 (D.D.C. 2018).  However, because \nthe Court also determined that DHS could possibly remedy the decision’s inadequacies—at least \nin theory—the Court stayed its order of vacatur for a period of ninety days.  See id.   \nThat  ninety-day  period  has  now  expired.    In  the  interim,  DHS  has  issued  a  new \nmemorandum  “concur[ring]  with  and  declin[ing]  to  disturb”  its  September  2017  rescission \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 2 of 25\ndecision.  Mem. from Sec’y Kirstjen M. Nielsen (“Nielsen Memo”) [ECF No. 71-1] at 3.1  Also, \nthe government has now moved the Court to revise its April 2018 order, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemo demonstrates that DACA’s rescission was neither unlawful nor subject to judicial review.  \nSee Defs.’ Mot. to Revise the Court’s April 24, 2018 Order (“Gov’t’s Mot.”) [ECF No. 74].   \nFor the reasons explained below, the government’s motion will be denied.  Although the \nNielsen Memo purports to offer further explanation for DHS’s decision to rescind DACA, it fails \nto elaborate meaningfully on the agency’s primary rationale for its decision: the judgment that the \npolicy was unlawful and unconstitutional.  And while the memo offers several additional “policy” \ngrounds for DACA’s rescission, most of these simply repackage legal arguments previously made, \nand hence are “insufficiently independent from the agency’s evaluation of DACA’s legality” to \npreclude judicial review or to support the agency’s decision.  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 235.  \nFinally, the memo does offer what appears to be one bona fide (albeit logically dubious) policy \nreason for DACA’s rescission, but this reason was articulated nowhere in DHS’s prior explanation \nfor its decision, and therefore cannot support that decision now. \nBy choosing to stand by its September 2017 rescission decision, DHS has placed itself in \na dilemma.  On the one hand, it cannot rely on the reasons it previously gave for DACA’s \nrescission, because the Court has already rejected them.  On the other, because “an agency’s action \nmust be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself,” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n \nof the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983), DHS also cannot rely \non new reasons that it now articulates for the first time.  The government’s attempt to thread this \n                                                 \n1 Although NAACP v. Trump, Civil Action No. 17-1907, was filed first, at the Court’s direction most of the \npapers in these two cases were filed in Princeton v. United States, Civil Action No. 17-2325.  See Min. Order, \nPrinceton (D.D.C. Jan. 18, 2018).  Thus, unless otherwise noted, references to the docket refer to the Princeton action. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 3 of 25\nneedle fails.  The motion to revise the Court’s April 2018 order will therefore be denied, and the \nCourt’s vacatur of DACA’s rescission will stand.    \nBACKGROUND2 \nThe DACA program offers renewable, two-year grants of deferred action to certain \nundocumented aliens who were brought to the United States as children.  See NAACP, 298 F. \nSupp. 3d at 216 (describing DACA’s eligibility criteria in greater detail).  A grant of deferred \naction under DACA guarantees not only that the recipient will not be removed from the United \nStates during the relevant time period, but also that she will be able to live, work, and contribute \nto society in various ways.  See id. at 216–17 (discussing DACA’s ancillary benefits).  Since \nDACA’s implementation in 2012, nearly 800,000 individuals have received grants of deferred \naction under the program.  Id. at 17. \nIn 2014, DHS implemented a similar program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \n(“DAPA”), which would have offered renewable grants of deferred action to the noncitizen parents \nof U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Id. at 217.  Before DAPA could take effect, \nhowever, several states—led by Texas—challenged it in federal court.  Id.  A district court \npreliminarily enjoined DAPA in 2015, and the following year the Supreme Court affirmed the \ndistrict court’s preliminary injunction by an equally divided vote.  See id. at 217–18 (citing United \nStates v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (mem)).  Litigation over DAPA continued until June 2017, \nwhen, following the election of President Trump, DHS rescinded the program.  Id. at 18. \nOn September 5, 2017, purportedly in response to threats from the plaintiffs in the Texas \nlitigation, DHS rescinded the DACA program as well.  Id. at 218–19.  A flurry of court challenges \n                                                 \n2 Because the facts and procedural history of this case were recounted at length in the Court’s prior opinion, \nsee NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 216–223, the Court will review them here only briefly.   \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 4 of 25\nfollowed, each of whose procedural history is described more fully in the Court’s prior opinion.  \nSee id. at 219–22.  For present purposes, it suffices to say that DACA’s rescission has been \npreliminarily enjoined by two district courts, one in California and one in New York, and that the \ngovernment’s appeals of those injunctions are currently pending.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1048 (N.D. Cal. 2018), appeal docketed, \nNo. 18-15068 (9th Cir. Jan. 16, 2018); Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437–38 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2018), appeal docketed, No. 18-485 (2d Cir. Feb. 20, 2018).  Also currently pending \nbefore the Fourth Circuit is an appeal of a Maryland district court’s dismissal of a challenge to \nDACA’s rescission.  Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 284 F. Supp. 3d 758, 779 \n(D. Md. 2018), appeal docketed, No. 18-1522 (4th Cir. May 8, 2018).  \nThe cases before this Court, which present challenges to DACA’s rescission on both \nadministrative and constitutional grounds, were filed in late 2017 and consolidated for purposes of \nthe dispositive motions filed in each.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 222–23.  After holding a \nhearing on those motions, the Court entered judgment in plaintiffs’ favor on their APA claims.  \nSee id. at 223, 249.  The Court held, among other things, that: (1) DHS’s September 5, 2017 \ndecision to rescind DACA was reviewable under the APA because it was predicated chiefly on the \nagency’s legal judgment that DACA was unlawful, see id. at 226–235; and (2) the decision was \narbitrary and capricious because (a) DHS’s legal judgment was inadequately explained, see id. at \n238–240,  and  (b)  the  other  reasons  offered  for  DACA’s  rescission—mainly,  the  purported \n“litigation risk” that DACA would be preliminarily enjoined by the district court in Texas—were \ninsufficiently reasoned, see id. at 241–243.  Hence, the Court vacated DACA’s rescission on \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 5 of 25\nadministrative  grounds,  see  id.  at  243–46,  and  deferred  ruling  on  the  bulk  of  plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims, id. at 246. \nHowever, because the Court’s decision was based in large part on its conclusion that DHS’s \nlegal judgment was “virtually unexplained,” the Court stayed its order of vacatur for 90 days to \nallow DHS “to better explain its view that DACA is unlawful.”  Id. at 249.  During that 90-day \nperiod, the Court explained,  \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security or her delegate may reissue a memorandum \nrescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller explanation for the determination \nthat  the  program  lacks  statutory  and  constitutional  authority.    Should  the \nDepartment  fail  to  issue  such  a  memorandum  within  90  days,  however,  the \nRescission Memo will be vacated in its entirety, and the original DACA program \nwill be restored in full. \n \nId. at 245–46.  The order accompanying the Court’s opinion directed the parties to inform the \nCourt before the stay expired as to “whether DHS has issued a new decision rescinding DACA \nand whether the parties contemplate the need for further proceedings in this case.”  Apr. 24, 2018 \nOrder [ECF No. 69] at 2.3  \n                                                 \n3 Soon after this Court issued its decision, several of the plaintiffs in the Texas litigation filed a new case \nchallenging DACA in a federal district court in Texas.  See Texas v. United States, No. 1:18-cv-68 (S.D. Tex. filed \nMay 1, 2018) (“Texas II”).  The Texas II plaintiffs assert that DACA is procedurally and substantively invalid under \nthe APA and that it violates the Constitution’s Take Care Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  See Compl. ¶¶ 351–56, \nTexas II (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2018).  The plaintiffs have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in that case, see Pls.’ \nMot. for a Prelim. Inj., Texas II (S.D. Tex. May 2, 2018), which is currently pending.  The government opposes the \nmotion only insofar as it seeks nationwide relief.  See Fed. Defs.’ Response to Pls.’ Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. at 17, Texas \nII (S.D. Tex. June 8, 2018).  Otherwise, although the government acknowledges that “[i]n similar situations, courts \nhave typically held that the appropriate course is for a district court to refrain from issuing a conflicting injunction,” \nid. at 17 (citations omitted), it nonetheless suggests that, assuming “that preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate,” \nthe district court should stay its order for fourteen days to allow the government to seek emergency relief from the \nSupreme Court, id. at 17–18.  Other parties, including the State of New Jersey, have intervened as defendants and \nopposed the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion in full.  See, e.g., Def.–Intervenor State of N.J.’s Mem. of Law \nin Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Texas II (S.D. Tex. July 21, 2018).  A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion is \ncurrently set for Wednesday, August 8, 2018.  \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 6 of 25\nIn late June, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen issued a memorandum \nresponding to the Court’s order.  See Nielsen Memo at 1.  Instead of issuing a new decision \nrescinding DACA, as the Court’s order had contemplated, Secretary Nielson simply “declin[ed] \nto disturb” the earlier decision to rescind the program by then-Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Elaine C. Duke.4  Id.  Secretary Nielsen then went on to offer several reasons why “the \ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, sound.”  Id.   \nSpecifically, Secretary Nielsen opined that: (1) “the DACA policy was contrary to law”; \n(2) regardless of whether DACA was in fact contrary to law, the program “was appropriately \nrescinded . . . because there are, at a minimum, serious doubts about its legality”; and (3) other \n“sound reasons of enforcement policy” supported DACA’s rescission.  Id. at 2.  The reasons in \nthis last category included that: (a) DHS “should not adopt public policies of non-enforcement of \n[federal] laws for broad classes and categories of aliens,” particularly aliens whom “Congress has \nrepeatedly considered but declined to protect”; (b) “DHS should only exercise its prosecutorial \ndiscretion not to enforce the immigration laws on a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and \n(c) “it is critically important for DHS to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, \nconsistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws,” particularly given that “tens of \nthousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent \nyears.”  Id. at 2–3.  Finally, Secretary Nielsen wrote that although she was “keenly aware that \nDACA recipients have availed themselves of the policy in continuing their presence in this \ncountry,” she nonetheless “do[es] not believe that the asserted reliance interests outweigh the \nquestionable legality of the DACA policy and the other reasons [given] for ending [it].”  Id. at 3.  \n                                                 \n4 Secretary Nielsen replaced Acting Secretary Duke as Secretary of Homeland Security on December 6, 2017.   \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 7 of 25\nIn July, following the issuance of the Nielsen Memo, the government filed the instant \nmotion to revise the Court’s April 24, 2018 order.  According to the government, the Nielsen \nMemo demonstrates that DHS’s September 2017 decision to rescind DACA was neither subject \nto judicial review nor arbitrary and capricious.  See Gov’t’s Mot. at 1–2.  This is so, the government \ncontends, because Secretary Nielsen’s articulation of “serious doubts” regarding DACA’s legality, \nsee id. at 5–13, as well as her “additional” discussion of enforcement-policy concerns, see id. at \n14–16, “confirm[]” that the rescission was both an exercise of enforcement discretion (as opposed \nto a legal judgment) and, at a minimum, reasonable, id. at 1.  Thus, the government asks the Court \neither to dismiss all of plaintiffs’ claims (including their constitutional claims) or to enter judgment \nin its favor.  See id. at 18–19.  Finally, the government states that, if the Court denies the motion, \nit intends to seek “a further continuation of the stay of the vacatur order,” either “to consider \nseeking a stay pending appeal or to give DHS time to appropriately prepare” to accept new DACA \napplications, “which DHS has generally not accepted since September 5, 2017.”  Id. at 19 n.4.  \nPlaintiffs offer several arguments in response.  First, they contend, the Court should not \neven consider Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum, because it is not “the new agency action [the] \nCourt anticipated [DHS] might take” during the ninety-day stay-of-vacatur period.  See Pls.’ Opp’n \nto Defs.’ Mot. to Revise the Court’s Apr. 24, 2018 Order (“Pls.’ Opp’n”) [ECF No. 75] at 3–8.  \nSecond, they argue that if the Court considers the Nielsen Memo at all, it should consider only the \nmemorandum’s legal analysis, because the remainder of the memorandum offers impermissible \npost hoc rationalizations of DHS’s rescission decision.  See id. at 8–10 (citing Food Mktg. Inst. v. \nICC, 587 F.2d 1285, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  Third, they contend that even if the Court considers \nthe Nielsen Memo  in full, its arguments present no reason to reconsider the Court’s prior \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 8 of 25\ndetermination that DACA’s rescission was both judicially reviewable, see id. at 10–14, and \narbitrary and capricious, see id. at 15–20.  Therefore, plaintiffs ask the Court to deny DHS’s motion \nand to allow the vacatur of DACA’s rescission to take effect.  See id. at 20. \nANALYSIS \nI.  THE COURT WILL CONSIDER THE NIELSEN MEMO \nAs a threshold matter, plaintiffs argue that the Court should refuse to consider the Nielsen \nMemo it its entirety, because instead of issuing a new rescission decision, the memo simply adopts \nand further explains DHS’s September 2017 rescission decision.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 3–8.5  The \ngovernment objects that this argument “inappropriately elevate[s] form over substance” and that \nagencies “routinely rectify decisions that are deemed inadequately supported on remand without \nvacatur.”  Reply in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Revise the Court’s April 24, 2018 Order (“Gov’t’s \nReply”) [ECF No. 76] at 1 (citations omitted).  Here, the Court agrees with the government.  It \nwill therefore consider the Nielsen Memo.   \nAs the government correctly points out, courts regularly remand challenges to agency \naction for further “elaboration of [the agency’s] reasoning.”  A.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 F.3d \n1484, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  Nonetheless, relying on Judge Silberman’s separate opinion in \nCheckosky v. SEC, 23 F.3d 452 (D.C. Cir. 1994), plaintiffs appear to suggest that courts can \nconsider such further explanations only before holding an agency action unlawful—and that, \nconsequently, this Court is powerless to consider the Nielsen Memo’s explanation of DHS’s \nrescission decision because it has already held that decision unlawful.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 4 \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs brand DHS’s failure to issue a new agency action as a “litigation tactic” that seeks to avoid “major \nconsequences for the litigation pending in the Second and Ninth Circuits—which could potentially include, among \nother things, triggering remands to the district courts or raising possible mootness questions and prompting new \ncomplaints.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 1, 8.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 9 of 25\n(“[W]hile courts do sometimes solicit further explanation of an action before deciding whether it \nis arbitrary and capricious, that is not what this Court did here.”).   \nBut neither Judge Silberman’s opinion in Checkosky nor any of the other cases on which \nplaintiffs rely go so far.  Rather, Judge Silberman explained that “courts will often . . . pause before \nexercising full judicial review and remand to the agency for a more complete explanation” and \nnoted that “[i]n many of these cases”—but not all of them—courts “make clear” that they “have \nnot found the agency action to be arbitrary and capricious.”  Checkosky, 23 F.3d at 463 (opinion \nof Silberman, J.) (emphasis added); see, e.g., City of Charlottesville v. FERC, 661 F.2d 945, 954 \n(D.C. Cir. 1981) (reversing an agency’s orders because they “were not based upon substantial \nevidence” and remanding for further proceedings); id. at 955 (Wald, J., concurring) (urging the \nagency  “on  remand  to  attempt  a  clearer  articulation  and  reconciliation  of  its”  apparently \ncontradictory explanations for its orders).  Thus, although it may be true that courts usually \nconsider additional explanation before invalidating an agency’s action, plaintiffs cite no authority \nfor the proposition that courts must maintain this order of operations.  Indeed, such a rule would \nbe inconsistent with the district courts’ broad discretion to reconsider their decisions before they \nbecome final.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); AARP v. EEOC, 292 F. Supp. 3d 238, 241 n.1 (D.D.C. \n2017) (“[A] district court order remanding a case to an agency for significant further proceedings \nis not final.” (quoting Pueblo of Sandia v. Babbitt, 231 F.3d 878, 880 (D.C. Cir. 2000))). \nHere, the Court gave DHS ninety days to remedy the deficiencies in its September 2017 \nrescission decision.  Although plaintiffs are correct that the Court’s opinion and order anticipated \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 10 of 25\nthat DHS would do so by way of a new agency action (if it did so at all),6 the Court will not \ndisregard Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum simply because she chose a somewhat different path.  \nInstead, the Court will treat the memo as what it purports to be: a “further explanation” of the \nrescission decision, Nielsen Memo at 1, which the government contends forms a basis for revising \nthe Court’s April 2018 order.  Likewise, the Court will construe the government’s motion for a \nrevised order as a motion for reconsideration of the Court’s April 2018 decision.  See Gov’t’s \nReply at 3 n.2 (proposing that, “[a]t a minimum, the Court could simply reconsider its [April 2018] \nOrder”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (district courts may “revise[]” nonfinal decisions “at any time” prior \nto the entry of final judgment).   \nII.  MOST OF THE NIELSEN MEMO’S ARGUMENTS ARE NOT POST HOC RATIONALIZATIONS \nNext, plaintiffs contend that the Court should disregard “nearly the entire Nielsen Memo” \nbecause none of the justifications it offers—aside from DACA’s purported illegality—were \narticulated by Acting Secretary Duke in her initial September 5, 2017 memorandum rescinding the \nDACA program (the “Duke Memo”), J.A. [ECF No. 60] at 252–56.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 8–10.  With \none notable exception, the Court disagrees.  Although many of the Nielsen Memo’s rationales are \nquite attenuated from those offered in the Duke Memo and its supporting documentation, only one \nis so far afield as to constitute an impermissibly post hoc rationalization for DACA’s rescission.  \nAlthough “post hoc rationalizations ‘have traditionally been found to be an inadequate \nbasis for review’ of agency decisions,” the D.C. Circuit has clarified that this rule “does not \n                                                 \n6 See Apr. 24, 2018 Order at 2 (directing the parties to inform the court as to whether DHS had “issued a new \ndecision rescinding DACA”); NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 246 (deferring ruling on plaintiffs’ constitutional claims in \npart because DHS “could, on remand, alter DACA’s rescission in ways that might affect the merits of plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims”); see also Pls.’ Opp’n at 5 (“[T]he import of this Court’s stay was not that the agency should \ntake another crack at defending the Duke Memo, but that the agency should be afforded an opportunity to replace its \nvoid decision seamlessly with a new one.”). \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 11 of 25\nprohibit [an agency] from submitting an amplified articulation” of the reasons for its decision \nfollowing a remand.  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).  \nIndeed, the rule’s purpose is simply to prevent courts from considering “rationales offered by \nanyone other than the proper decisionmakers,” such as those appearing “for the first time in \nlitigation affidavits and arguments of counsel”; it is not meant to be “a time barrier which freezes \nan agency’s exercise of its judgment . . . and bars it from further articulation of its reasoning.”  Id. \n(citation omitted).  Hence, when faced with an explanation offered for the first time on remand, a \ncourt must determine whether it is an “amplified articulation” of the agency’s prior reasoning \n(which must be considered), Alpharma, 460 F.3d at 6 (citation omitted), or instead “a new reason \nfor why the agency could have” taken the action (which must be disregarded), Delta Air Lines, \nInc. v. Export–Import Bank of U.S., 85 F. Supp. 3d 436, 453 (D.D.C. 2015); see Muwekma Ohlone \nTribe v. Salazar, 708 F.3d 209, 217 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (stating that an agency’s further \nexplanation on remand “must be more than a barren exercise of supplying reasons to support a \npre-ordained result” (citation omitted)). \nHere, plaintiffs argue that the bulk of the Nielsen Memo falls in the latter category.  \nSpecifically, they contend, Secretary Nielsen’s assertion of “serious doubts” about DACA’s \nlegality “does not amplify or explicate” the Duke Memo’s prediction that DACA would be \nabruptly enjoined in the Texas litigation; rather, “it silently abandons it.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 10.  \nSimilarly, plaintiffs argue that the various “purported ‘reasons of enforcement policy’” raised in \nthe Nielsen Memo “have no foundation in the Duke Memo at all.”  See id. \nPlaintiffs overstate the novelty of the Nielsen Memo’s arguments.  Although the Nielsen \nMemo certainly expands on the Duke Memo’s points, most of its arguments are not so detached \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 12 of 25\nfrom the earlier document as to appear post hoc.  For example, the Nielsen Memo contends that \n“serious doubts” about DACA’s legality could “undermine public confidence in . . . the rule of \nlaw” and lead to “burdensome litigation.”  Nielsen Memo at 2.  Similarly, the Duke Memo \nexpressly relied on a September 4, 2017 letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions (the “Sessions \nLetter”), see J.A. at 254–55, which cited “the costs and burdens” associated with rescinding DACA \nin response to “potentially imminent litigation,” and opined that “[p]roper enforcement of our \nimmigration laws is . . . critical . . . to the restoration of the rule of law in our country,” J.A. at 251.  \nThe Nielsen Memo’s “serious doubts” rationale strikes this Court as a permitted amplification, \nrather than a prohibited post hoc rationalization, of these statements in the Sessions Letter. \nThe same is true of the Nielsen Memo’s remaining “policy” justifications (again, save one).  \nLike the Nielsen Memo, which faults DACA for protecting a class of aliens whom Congress has \n“repeatedly considered but declined to protect,” Nielsen Memo at 2, the Duke Memo relied on \n“Congress’s repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar \nresult” as DACA, J.A. at 254.  Similarly, the Nielsen Memo’s concerns about “individualized, \ncase-by-case” discretion, Nielsen Memo at 3, parallel the Duke Memo’s observation that DACA \nwas “meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis” and that DHS “has not \nbeen able to identify specific denial cases . . . based solely upon discretion,” J.A. at 253.   \nThe same cannot be said, however, about the Nielsen Memo’s concern with “project[ing] \na message” to noncitizen children (and their parents) who would attempt to enter the United States \nunlawfully.  Nielsen Memo at 3.  Nothing in the Duke Memo or the Sessions Letter even remotely \nparallels the Nielsen Memo’s discussion of a “pattern” of illegal immigration by minors, and \nneither document mentions the “tens of thousands of minor aliens [who] have illegally crossed or \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 13 of 25\nbeen smuggled across our border in recent years,” id.  Indeed, the closest either document comes \nis the Sessions Letter’s assertion that “[p]roper enforcement of our immigration laws is . . . critical \nto the national interest,” J.A. at 251, but this statement is far too vague—on some level, nearly any \npolicy statement could be seen as an explication of an agency’s view of the “national interest.”  \nConsequently, the Court will decline to consider the Nielsen Memo’s “messaging” rationale, \nwhich appears for the first time on remand and is therefore impermissibly post hoc.  See Food \nMktg. Inst., 587 F.2d at 1290 (“Post-hoc rationalizations by the agency on remand are no more \npermissible than are such arguments when raised by appellate counsel during judicial review.”).7  \nIn sum, although none of the Nielsen Memo’s rationales for DACA’s rescission relate back \nperfectly to the Duke Memo’s, only one—the messaging rationale—is so attenuated as to comprise \n“a new reason for why the agency could have” rescinded DACA.  Delta Air Lines, 85 F. Supp. 3d \nat 453.  The Court will therefore consider all of the Nielsen Memo except its messaging rationale. \nIII.  THE NIELSEN MEMO PROVIDES NO REASON TO REVISE THE COURT’S EARLIER \nDETERMINATION THAT DACA’S RESCISSION WAS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW \nThis Court previously held that DHS’s September 2017 decision to rescind the DACA \nprogram was subject to judicial review despite the APA’s exception for “agency action [that] is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at \n234.  This was so, the Court explained, because although the Supreme Court has held enforcement \ndecisions to be “presumptively unreviewable,” NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 234 (citing Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832–33 (1985)), the D.C. Circuit recognizes an exception for “general \nenforcement polic[ies]” that “rel[y] solely on the agency’s view of what the law requires,” id. (first \n                                                 \n7 Of course, had Secretary Nielsen opted to issue a new decision rescinding DACA, the explanations offered \nin her memorandum would be contemporaneous and, consequently, not post hoc.  She did not do this, however.  \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 14 of 25\nciting OSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 808, 812 (D.C. Cir. 1998); and then citing \nCrowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Peña, 37 F.3d 671, 676–77 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).8  This rule \nreflects the commonsense notion that “an otherwise reviewable” legal interpretation “does not \nbecome presumptively unreviewable simply because the agency characterizes it as an exercise of \nenforcement discretion.”  Id. at 231. \nThe Court held that DACA’s rescission was reviewable under this exception because it was \n“predicated on DHS’s legal determination that the program was invalid when it was adopted.”  Id. \nat 233.  The Court rejected what it took to be the government’s attempt to distinguish between an \nagency’s “interpretation of a specific statutory provision” (which the government conceded was \nreviewable) and its “conclusion that it lacks statutory authority” (which the government contended \nwas unreviewable), explaining that “[t]o say that a particular agency action is ‘without statutory \nauthority’ is simply to say that no statutory provision authorizes that action.”  Id. at 232 (citing \nCity  of  Arlington  v.  FCC,  569  U.S.  290,  299–300  (2013)).9    The  Court  also  rejected  the \ngovernment’s reliance on what it had termed “litigation risk”—that is, the adverse consequences \nthat would follow if DACA were struck down in litigation—explaining that “Crowley would be a \ndead letter” if an agency “could insulate from judicial review any legal determination simply by \n                                                 \n8 The D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in CREW v. FEC confirms this Court’s reading of Circuit law.  See 892 \nF.3d 434, 441 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (“[I]f [an agency] declines to bring an enforcement action on the basis of its \ninterpretation of [a statute], the [agency’s] decision is subject to judicial review.”).   \n9 In its present motion, DHS attempts to relitigate this issue, contending that “Secretary Nielsen’s further \nexplanation of DACA’s questionable legality also underscores why Crowley does not permit judicial review of an \nenforcement decision simply because that decision rests on a legal rationale.”  Gov’t’s Mot. at 7.  Once again, DHS \nattempts to draw a “distinction between the non-reviewability of an enforcement decision, and the potential \nreviewability of the supporting rationale on its own terms,” id. at 8, and contends that “even if a general legal rationale \nin the Duke or Nielsen Memos could be carved out for review on its own terms, that would not justify reviewing the \nenforcement decision to rescind DACA itself,” id. at 9.  But the Court rejects this novel proposition.  As the D.C. \nCircuit has recently confirmed, although “[t]he law of this circuit ‘rejects the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings \nout from the middle of non-reviewable actions,” CREW, 892 F.3d at 442 (citation omitted), an agency action is not \n“non-reviewable” in the first place if it is “based entirely on its interpretation of the statute,” id. at 441 n.11. \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 15 of 25\nframing it as an enforcement policy” and then tacking on a boilerplate assertion that “a court would \nlikely agree with the agency’s interpretation.”  Id. at 233.   \nNeither the Nielsen Memo nor the government’s motion provides a sufficient basis for \nreconsidering the Court’s earlier determination that DACA’s rescission was judicially reviewable.  \nTo start with, Secretary Nielsen makes clear that her decision not to disturb DACA’s rescission is \npredicated first and foremost on her view that “the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  Nielsen \nMemo at 2.  Thus, this case continues to be like Crowley and OSG: at bottom, it involves an \nenforcement policy that is predicated on the agency’s view of what the law requires.   \nNor do the Nielsen Memo’s remaining rationales immunize from judicial review DHS’s \ndecision to rescind DACA.  The first of these revolves around Secretary Nielsen’s “serious doubts \nabout [DACA’s] legality,” which she says would lead her to rescind the policy regardless of \n“whether the courts would ultimately uphold it or not.”  Id.  These doubts, Secretary Nielsen \nexplains, raise concerns like “the risk that such policies may undermine public confidence in and \nreliance on the agency and the rule of law, and the threat of burdensome litigation that distracts \nfrom the agency’s work.”  Id.  According to the government, this rationale renders DACA’s \nrescission unreviewable because it “cannot be meaningfully distinguished from other ‘bona fide \ndiscretionary reasons’ that this Court found acceptable” in its prior opinion, “such as an agency’s \nfear that ‘negative publicity . . . would undermine the policy’s effectiveness.’”  Gov’t’s Mot. at 7 \n(quoting NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 233).  \nBut as the Court’s opinion explained in the very next paragraph, it is difficult to conclude \nthat such policy assertions are “bona fide” when they are accompanied by an assertion from the \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 16 of 25\nagency that its longstanding policy is “unlawful.”  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 233.10  In this \nrespect, the “serious doubts” rationale suffers from the same defect as the “litigation risk” \nrationale: accepting it here would permit agencies to insulate their legal judgments from judicial \nreview simply by couching them as enforcement policies and then adding a boilerplate assertion \nthat any other course of action would lead to litigation and undermine confidence in the rule of \nlaw.  Judicial review of agency legal determinations cannot be so easily evaded.  \nNext, the Nielsen Memo asserts a handful of “sound reasons of enforcement policy” that it \nargues would justify DACA’s rescission “regardless of whether . . . the DACA policy [is] illegal \nor legally questionable.”  Nielsen Memo at 2.  First among these is the memo’s claim that, “if a \npolicy concerning the ability of this class of aliens to remain in the United States is to be adopted, \nit should be enacted legislatively.”  Id. at 3.  But the Court rejected the government’s reliance on \nthis argument in its prior opinion, concluding that the government had failed to explain why “an \nagency’s view as to which branch of government ought to address a particular policy issue is an \nassessment appropriately committed to the agency’s discretion.”  NAACP, 298 F.  Supp. 3d at 243 \nn.28.  Like the litigation-risk and substantial-doubts rationales, then, this legislative-inaction \nrationale is simply another legal determination dressed up as a policy judgment, and it cannot \nrender DACA’s rescission immune from judicial review.  \nThe memo’s second “policy” justification asserts that “DHS should only exercise its \nprosecutorial discretion not to enforce the immigration laws on a truly individualized, case-by-\ncase basis.”  Nielsen Memo at 3.  This is so, Secretary Nielsen claims, not because “a categorical \n                                                 \n10 While the Court’s opinion did not suggest that an agency cannot rescind a policy in response to an adverse \ncourt judgment notwithstanding the agency’s continued belief in the policy’s legality, it did suggest that where (as \nhere) the agency rescinds a policy after doing an about-face as to its legality, “there are reasons to be more suspicious.”  \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 233. \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 17 of 25\ndeferred-action  policy”  like  DACA  raises  legal  or  constitutional  concerns—as  previously \nargued—but rather because such a policy “tilts the scales significantly and has the practical effect \nof inhibiting assessments of whether deferred action is appropriate in a particular case.”  Id.  In \nessence, the Secretary claims that even though DACA “on its face . . . allow[s] for individual \nconsiderations,” id., it should nonetheless be rescinded because its programmatic nature somehow \nmisleads those charged with its implementation into applying it categorically.   \nAs an initial matter, this rationale strikes the Court as specious.  It would be one thing for \na challenger other than DHS to claim that although DACA calls for case-by-case discretion in \ntheory, its application is categorical in practice.  Indeed, this argument was made by the plaintiffs \nin the Texas litigation.  See Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 171–72 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by \nan equally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (mem).  But when made by the agency itself, the \nargument  becomes  a  non  sequitur:  if  Secretary  Nielsen  believes  that  DACA  is  not  being \nimplemented as written, she can simply direct her employees to implement it properly.  An agency \nhead cannot point to her own employees’ misapplication of a program as a reason for its invalidity. \nSpecious though it may be, this rationale nonetheless presents as the sort of policy \nconsideration that, when offered as an independent reason for adopting a general enforcement \npolicy, might foreclose judicial review.  When viewed in the broader context of this litigation, \nhowever, this rationale reveals itself to be yet another attempt to disguise an objection to DACA’s \nlegality as a policy justification for its rescission.   \nThroughout  the  litigation  over  DAPA  and  DACA,  the  programs’  challengers  have \nconsistently claimed that although DACA “facially purports to confer discretion,” in practice \ndeferred action was categorically granted to anyone who met the program’s eligibility criteria.  \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 18 of 25\nTexas, 809 F.3d at 171–72.  This argument was offered by the Texas plaintiffs as a reason that \nDAPA should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking, see id., and by the government in \nthis case as a reason to uphold DHS’s conclusion that DACA was unlawful, see Reply in Supp. of \nDefs.’ Mot. to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 55] at 22 (“While [the \nFifth  Circuit’s]  finding  [that  DACA  was  applied  categorically]  had  to  be  ‘extrapolated’  to \ninvalidate DAPA, it directly dooms DACA itself . . . .” (citation omitted)).  Likewise, the Duke \nMemo cast DACA’s alleged categorical application as an issue of lawfulness, explaining that \ndeferred action was “meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis,” not to \n“confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by law.”  \nSee J.A. at 253.  Even a 2014 memorandum by the Office of Legal Counsel (the “OLC Memo”) \ncautioned that “it was critical that . . . the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate \neach application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action \nautomatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.”  J.A. at 21 n.8.   \nTaken in context, then, Secretary Nielsen’s claim that rescinding DACA would further her \npolicy objective of ensuring the distribution of deferred action grants on a “case-by-case” basis is \nsimply a repackaging in policy terms of an oft-repeated objection to DACA’s lawfulness.  And \nwhile a remand provides an agency the opportunity to elaborate on its prior positions in good faith, \nit is not an opportunity for the agency to alter those positions—particularly where the chief design \nof doing so appears to be to defeat judicial review.  The Court therefore concludes that the Nielsen \nMemo’s individualized-discretion rationale does not preclude judicial review here.  \nFinally, the memo asserts that “it is critically important for DHS to project a message that \nleaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 19 of 25\nlaws,” particularly given that “tens of thousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been \nsmuggled across our border in recent years.”  Nielsen Memo at 3.  As the Court has already \nexplained, this rationale is a post hoc rationalization and hence is not entitled to consideration on \nremand.  See Food Mktg. Inst., 587 F.2d at 1290.  But even if the Court were to consider this \nrationale, it would not immunize DACA’s rescission from judicial review.   \nWith this messaging rationale, Secretary Nielsen finally articulates (albeit in a single \nsentence) what might be properly characterized as a policy reason for DACA’s rescission: a \njudgment that DACA’s benefits—whatever they may be—are outweighed by the fact that, in \nSecretary Nielsen’s view, the policy encourages noncitizen children and their parents to enter the \nUnited States illegally.  Of course, this rationale is not without its logical difficulties: after all, \nDACA is available only to those individuals who have lived in the United States since 2007, see \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 216, so the “tens of thousands of minor aliens” who Secretary Nielsen \nasserts have illegally entered the United States “in recent years” would not even be eligible under \nthe program.  But no matter.  The question for reviewability purposes is not whether the rationale \nmakes sense, but rather whether it transforms DACA’s rescission from a decision based “solely \non [DHS’s] belief that it lacks jurisdiction,” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4, into a decision based on \n“factors  which  are  peculiarly  within  [DHS’s]  expertise,”  such  as  “whether  the  particular \nenforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies,” id. at 831.  \nEven if the messaging rationale were sufficiently grounded in the Duke Memo so as to be \nan amplification rather than a post hoc rationalization, ultimately it would still be too little, too \nlate.  Although the Nielsen Memo states several paragraphs earlier that each of its reasons is \n“separate and independently sufficient” to support DACA’s rescission, Nielsen Memo at 1, the \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 20 of 25\ndocument’s cursory discussion of the messaging  rationale—which is articulated in a single \nsentence on the last page of the three-page memorandum—does not support this assertion.  See \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 233–34 (noting that, in Chaney, the agency took the position that \n“even if it had jurisdiction, it would still decline to act pursuant to its ‘inherent discretion to decline \nto pursue certain enforcement matters’” (quoting Chaney, 470 U.S. at 824–25)).  The Court would \nnot conclude that this solitary sentence in the Nielsen Memo wholly transmutes the explanation \nfor DACA’s rescission from an issue of law into an issue of policy.   \nIn any case, the Court need not reach this conclusion because, as it has already explained, \nthe messaging rationale is merely a post hoc rationalization of DACA’s rescission.  And because, \nas  explained  above,  the  other  rationales  offered  by  the  Nielsen  Memo  are  “insufficiently \nindependent from the agency’s evaluation of DACA’s legality” to defeat review, id. at 235, the \nCourt  declines  to  reverse  its  prior  conclusion  that  DACA’s  rescission  is  reviewable.    The \ngovernment’s motion for reconsideration will therefore be denied as to reviewability.  \nIV.  THE NIELSEN MEMO PROVIDES NO REASON TO REVISE THE COURT’S EARLIER \nDETERMINATION THAT DACA’S RESCISSION WAS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \nThe Court now turns to whether the Nielsen Memo provides a basis for revising the Court’s \nprior determination that DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious.  See id. at 237–43.  As \nexplained below, it does not.  \nMost glaringly, the Nielsen Memo provides almost no meaningful elaboration on the Duke \nMemo’s assertion that DACA is unlawful.  The Nielsen Memo again ignores the 2014 OLC Memo \nlaying out a comprehensive framework for evaluating the lawfulness of nonenforcement policies \nin the immigration context, see J.A. at 4–36—an omission that plaintiffs properly characterize as \n“mystifying,” Pls.’ Opp’n at 18, given the Court’s prior emphasis on the document, see NAACP, \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 21 of 25\n298 F. Supp. 3d at 239 & n. 22.11  Instead, like the Duke Memo before it, the Nielsen Memo relies \nprimarily on the one-page Sessions Letter and on the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in the DAPA litigation.  \nSee Nielsen Memo at 2.  But as this Court has already said, the Sessions Letter’s conclusory legal \nassertions are themselves inadequately explained, and the Fifth Circuit’s analysis in the DAPA \ncase is “inapposite” here given the meaningful distinctions between DAPA and DACA, which \ninclude DAPA’s open-ended nature, broad scope, and apparent conflict with express provisions of \nthe INA.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 238–40 (citing Texas, 809 F.3d at 179).   \nIn response, Secretary Nielsen states that “[a]ny arguable distinctions between the DAPA \nand DACA policies are not sufficiently material to convince me that the DACA policy is lawful.”  \nNielsen Memo at 2.  But she does not explain why.  Secretary Nielsen also asserts that the Fifth \nCircuit’s DAPA ruling was based not on any particular statutory conflict, but rather on DAPA’s \n“incompatibility . . . with the INA’s comprehensive scheme.”  Id.  But as plaintiffs correctly point \nout, see Pls.’ Opp’n at 15–16, even if this were an accurate characterization of the Fifth Circuit’s \nopinion,12 the Nielsen Memo offers no clue as to how an agency official, a court, or anyone else \nwould go about determining whether a particular nonenforcement policy meets Secretary Nielsen’s \n                                                 \n11 As was true with respect to the Duke Memo, the mere fact that the OLC Memo appears in the administrative \nrecord, even when combined with the Nielsen Memo’s statement that Secretary Nielsen has “considered . . . the \nadministrative record,” Nielsen Memo at 1, does not amount to meaningful consideration for purposes of the APA.  \nNor does the Court agree that “the OLC Memo has little significance, especially given that its analysis as to DAPA \nwas later rejected by the Fifth Circuit (in a decision affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court) as well as by the \nAttorney General.”  Gov’t’s Mot. at 13.  For one thing, the Fifth Circuit did not expressly disapprove the OLC Memo; \nindeed, the one time it mentioned the memo, it cited it as an authoritative source.  See Texas, 809 F.3d at 184 n.197.  \nAnd in any case, to the extent that the panel majority’s analysis in Texas was inconsistent with OLC Memo, its decision \nwas affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court and so is not binding outside of the Fifth Circuit.  See Nichols v. \nUnited States, 511 U.S. 738, 750 (1994) (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that “a decision . . . by an \nequally divided [Supreme] Court” is “entitled to no precedential value”).  Similarly, the one-page Sessions Letter did \nnot directly address the OLC Memo or expressly overrule its analysis.  J.A. at 251.  \n12 But see Texas, 809 F.3d at 184 n. 197 (“[O]ur conclusion turns on whether the INA gives DHS the power \nto create and implement a sweeping class-wide rule changing the immigration status of the affected aliens without full \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, especially where—as here—the directive is flatly contrary to the statutory text.” \n(emphasis added)). \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 22 of 25\ntest for “compatibility” with the overall statutory scheme.  Thus, like the Duke Memo before it, \nthe Nielsen Memo offers nothing even remotely approaching a considered legal assessment that \nthis Court could subject to judicial review. \nNor do the Nielsen Memo’s remaining rationales persuade the Court to revise its prior \nconclusion that DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious.  As the Court has already \nindicated, those rationales carry varying degrees of persuasive force, and some may fall below the \nAPA’s standard of rationality.  But as the D.C. Circuit has explained, “[w]here . . . an agency has \nset out multiple independent grounds for a decision,” courts will uphold that decision “so long as \nany one of the grounds is valid, unless it is demonstrated that the agency would not have acted on \nthat basis if the alternative grounds were unavailable.”  Fogo De Chao (Holdings) Inc. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 769 F.3d 1127, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).   \nHere, Secretary Nielsen states in a somewhat conclusory fashion that each of the grounds \noffered in her memo is “independently sufficient” to support DACA’s rescission.  Nielsen Memo \nat 1.  The Court is skeptical of this assertion, particularly given its conclusion that three of those \ngrounds—the substantial-doubts, legislative-inaction, and individualized-discretion rationales—\nsimply  recapitulate  the  Secretary’s  inadequately  explained  legal  assessment,  and  that  the \nremaining ground—projecting a message to would-be illegal immigrants—appears nowhere in the \nDuke Memo and is therefore post hoc.  Even assuming that these rationales are indeed independent \nand that at least one is sufficiently rational to survive APA review, however, DACA’s rescission \nwould still be arbitrary and capricious because the Nielsen Memo—like the Duke Memo before \nit—fails to engage meaningfully with the reliance interests and other countervailing factors that \nweigh against ending the program.  See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 240. \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 23 of 25\nAlthough this time around the Nielsen Memo at least “acknowledge[s] how heavily DACA \nbeneficiaries had come to rely on” the program, id., it does little more than that.  Instead of \nconsidering DACA’s benefits to DACA recipients and to society at large, see Pls.’ Opp’n at 19–\n20, Secretary Nielsen simply states that “the asserted reliance interests” are outweighed by \nDACA’s “questionable legality . . . and the other reasons for ending the policy,” and then goes on \nto suggest that she should not even have to consider those interests.  See id.  (asserting that “issues \nof reliance would be best considered by Congress”).  However, it is not up to Secretary Nielsen—\nor even to this Court—to decide what she should or should not consider when reversing agency \npolicy.  Rather, the requirements are set by the APA, as interpreted by the Supreme Court: “When \nan agency changes its existing position, it . . . must . . . be cognizant that longstanding policies may \nhave ‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’”  Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125–26 (2016).   \nLike the Duke Memo, the Nielsen Memo demonstrates no true cognizance of the serious \nreliance interests at issue here—indeed, it does not even identify what those interests are.  “It would \nbe arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters,” Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. \n1199, 1209 (2015) (citation omitted), and it is so here.  Nor, given the inadequacy of the Nielsen \nMemo’s explanation of why DACA is unlawful, can the Court accept as sufficient its bare \ndetermination that any reliance interests are outweighed by “the questionable legality of the DACA \npolicy and the other” fatally intertwined reasons listed in the memo.  Nielsen Memo at 3.  Because \nthe Nielsen Memo fails to provide an adequate justification for the decision to rescind DACA—\nmuch less the “more substantial justification” that the APA requires when an agency’s “prior \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 24 of 25\npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests,” Perez, 135 S. Ct. at 1209—the Court sees no \nreason to change its earlier determination that DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court again concludes that DHS’s September 2017 decision \nto rescind the DACA program, as now explained in the Duke and Nielsen Memos, was both subject \nto judicial review and arbitrary and capricious.  The Court has already once given DHS the \nopportunity to remedy these deficiencies—either by providing a coherent explanation of its legal \nopinion or by reissuing its decision for bona fide policy reasons that would preclude judicial \nreview—so it will not do so again.  Consequently, the government’s motion to reconsider the \nCourt’s April 24, 2018 order will be denied.  Per the government’s request, however, the Court \nwill continue the stay of its order of vacatur for a brief period—twenty days—to permit the \ngovernment to determine whether it intends to appeal the Court’s decision and, if so, to seek a stay \npending appeal.  In all other respects, the Court’s April 24, 2018 order will remain in force.  \nFinally, a few words about the nature of the relief being granted by this Court.  The Court \ndid not hold in its prior opinion, and it does not hold today, that DHS lacks the statutory or \nconstitutional authority to rescind the DACA program.  Rather, the Court simply holds that if DHS \nwishes to rescind the program—or to take any other action, for that matter—it must give a rational \nexplanation for its decision.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  A conclusory assertion that a prior policy is \nillegal, accompanied by a hodgepodge of illogical or post hoc policy assertions, simply will not \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-JDB   Document 27   Filed 08/03/18   Page 25 of 25\ndo.  The Court therefore reaffirms its conclusion that DACA’s rescission was unlawful and must \nbe set aside.13  A separate order has been issued on this date.  \n \n                        /s/                      \nJOHN D.

See, e.g., Trump \nv. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018) (noting but declining to address the issue); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 \nF.3d 272, 293 (7th Cir. 2018) (concluding that the district court did not “abuse[] its discretion in determining that the \nscope of the injunction should be nationwide”), reh’g granted, No. 17-2991 (7th Cir. June 4, 2018) (granting rehearing \nen banc “only as to the geographic scope of the preliminary injunction entered by the district court”).  That debate is \nnot implicated here, however, where the Court is vacating an agency action pursuant to the APA, as opposed to \nenjoining it as a violation of the Constitution or other applicable law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (“The reviewing court \nshall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”); Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“When a \nreviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not \nthat their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.”).   \n25 \n \n ",

TRUMP, in his official \nCase No.1:17-cv-01907 \ncapacity as President of the United States, \nJEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS \nIII, in his official capacity as the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, ELAINE C. \nDUKE, in her official capacity as acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security, U.S. \nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION \nSERVICES; U.S. IMMIGRATION AND \nCUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \nSECURITY; AND THE UNITED STATES \nOF AMERICA, \n \nDefendants. \n \n[PROPOSED] FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), \nthe American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”), and the United Food and Commercial Workers \nInternational Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (“UFCW”) bring this action in their organizational \ncapacities against the President of the United States and the federal government for unlawfully \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 2 of 20\n \nreneging on their promise to protect young, undocumented immigrants of color living in the \nUnited States. This action alleges violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This action also seeks \ndeclaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201. \n2.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) refers to the United \nStates’ immigration policy concerning undocumented immigrants who arrived in America as \nchildren.  Under this policy, people who immigrated to the United States when they were \nyounger than 16 and have lived in the United States continuously since 2007 were eligible to \ndefer deportation indefinitely, attend school, and receive two-year work permits, among other \nbenefits.  \n3.  The vast majority of DACA registrants are people of color. More than 80% of \nregistrants are of Mexican origin. \n4.  In exchange for providing the federal government with extensive biographic and \nbiometric information, DACA registrants1  received the United States’ promise that they could \nbuild lives for themselves in the United States without fear of prosecution or deportation. \n5.  However, a little less than two weeks ago, the President of the United States and \nthe United States Attorney General announced their intention to renege on those promises. \n6.  On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, on behalf of President \nDonald Trump, announced that the Trump Administration was rescinding the DACA program. \nThe same day, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a memorandum \nmemorializing the rescission. The Attorney General announced that, effective immediately, DHS \n                                                 \n1 The children of undocumented parents who were brought to this country and grew up here \nbecame known as DREAMers, after the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation meant to give them a \npath to citizenship that was first introduced in 2001. Approximately 1.3 million Dreamers were \neligible to enroll in DACA, and to date approximately 800,000 have done so. \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 3 of 20\n \nwould stop processing or accepting new DACA applications, cease allowing DACA registrants \nto visit their families abroad and return to the United States, and issue renewals only for \nregistrants whose terms expired before March 5, 2018 as long as they applied for renewal by \nOctober 5, 2018.  \n7.  The Trump Administration announced this rescission without regards to the Due \nProcess rights of the DACA registrants, and without engaging in the required analysis or \nrulemaking procedures required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Administrative \nProcedure Act, both of which are laws put into place to safeguard the public against this very \ntype of impulsiveness by leaders in powerful positions. \n8.  As a result, the NAACP, AFT, and UFCW, whose respective memberships \ninclude DACA registrants across the United States, respectfully requests that this Court declare \nthe termination of the DACA program unlawful, and enjoin the Trump Administration from \neffectuating its rescission. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n10.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and \n1391(e)(1). Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. \nSeveral Defendant agencies are residents of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the District of Columbia. \nIII.  PARTIES \n11.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the nation’s \nlargest and oldest civil rights grassroots organization. Since its founding in 1909, the mission of \nthe NAACP has been to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of all \npersons and to eliminate race-based discrimination. The NAACP has fought in the courts for \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 4 of 20\n \ndecades to protect the guarantee of equal protection under law. To advance its mission, the  \nNAACP has represented parties in landmark civil rights cases, perhaps most famously in Brown \nv. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which outlawed segregation in public \nschools. The NAACP also has filed numerous amicus briefs over its decades of existence in \ncases that significantly impact people of color. \n12.  NAACP has members throughout the country who are enrolled in the DACA \nProgram. Accordingly, the NAACP brings this action on behalf of those members who are \ncurrently enrolled in, and who applied to enroll in, the DACA Program. NAACP members who \nare DACA registrants reside throughout the United States, including in California, Florida, New \nYork, and Rhode Island, as well as other States. \n13.  The American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”), an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, was \nfounded in 1916, and today represents approximately 1.7 million members who are employed \nacross the nation in K-12 and higher education, public employment, and healthcare. The AFT \nhas a longstanding history of supporting and advocating for the civil rights of its members and \nthe communities they serve. \n14.  The AFT has members throughout the country that have received work permits \nthrough the DACA program. These members have utilized DACA work permits to obtain \nemployment in institutions that provide essential and necessary services, such as healthcare and \neducation, to the public. AFT members also teach students who have received DACA benefits. \nThese students are integral members of their educational institutions. They contribute to the \ndiversity of experience and viewpoint in classrooms, engage in valuable research projects, and \nplay leadership roles in student life. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 5 of 20\n \n15.  The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC \nis a labor organization which represents working men and women across the United States.  \nUFCW’s 1.3 million members work in a range of industries, with the majority working in retail \nfood, non-food retail, meatpacking and poultry, food processing, and manufacturing.  UFCW is \nthe largest union of young workers with 40% of its members under the age of 30.  UFCW’s \nobjective is the elevation of its members and other employees engaged in the performance of \nwork through improving their wages, hours, benefits, and working conditions.  More broadly, \nUFCW fights to advance and safeguard full employment, economic security, and social welfare \nof its members and their communities. \n16.  UFCW and its predecessor unions have represented immigrants from around the \nworld since the beginning of the last century, particularly workers in the packinghouses and \nstockyards.  Immigrant workers continue to form a vital part of these and other workforces that \nUFCW represents.  In particular, UFCW has members who are DACA recipients across \nindustries in which it represents employees.  UFCW is proud that its representation enables \nDACA recipients to personally advance and contribute to their families and American society \ngenerally. \n17.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He authorized \nthe issuance of the Department of Homeland Security Memorandum that purports to rescind \nDACA. He is being sued in his official capacity. \n18.  Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, and announced the purported rescission of DACA on September 5, 2017. He has \nultimate authority over prosecutions by the Department of Justice for violation of the \nimmigration laws. He is being sued in his official capacity. \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 6 of 20\n \n19.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. She is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, and oversees the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) and the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). She is being sued in her official capacity. \n20.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \nDACA program. DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government, and is \nan agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n21.  Defendant USCIS is an Operational and Support Component agency within DHS. \nUSCIS is the sub-agency responsible for administering the DACA program. \n22.  Defendant ICE is an Operational and Support Component agency within DHS. \nICE is responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, including identifying, apprehending, \ndetaining, and removing non-citizens. \n23.  Defendant the United States of America includes all government agencies and \ndepartments responsible for the implementation and rescission of the DACA program. \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The DACA Program Promised Young Immigrants Opportunities and Peace \nof Mind in Exchange for Extensive Personal Data \n24.  On June 15, 2012, former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, \nissued a memorandum establishing a deferred prosecution program. She inveighed against \n“blindly enforc[ing]” immigration laws to deport those who came to the United States as \nchildren, and who have been productive Americans. As part of exercising prosecutorial \ndiscretion, the government developed extensive criteria that must be meet by Dreamers \na.  That they were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; \nb.  That they entered the United States prior to their 16th birthday; \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 7 of 20\n \nc.  That they had resided in the United States since June 15, 2007 and currently are \npresent in the U.S.; \nd.  That they were in the United States on June 15, 2012 and must be physically in \nthe U.S. at the time of filing for your request for deferred action; \ne.  That they entered the United States without border inspection before June 15, \n2012, or their immigration status expired prior to June 15, 2012; \nf.  That they must be currently in school, have graduated, or obtained an equivalent \ncertificate of completion from high school, successfully obtained a general education \ndevelopment (GED) certificate, or must have been honorably discharged from the Armed \nForces of the United States; and \ng.  That they must not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, \nthree or more other misdemeanors, and must not pose a threat to national security or \npublic safety.2 \n25.  In addition to meeting these requirements, DACA recipients had to provide the \nfollowing as part of the application process: financial records, medical records, school records \n(diploma, report card, GED certificate, high-school transcript), employment records, or military \nrecords (personnel records, health record). \n26.  Applicants are required to provide biographical information, including their \narrival in the country, previous departures, previous addresses of both themselves and those they \ntraveled with. \n                                                 \n2 Prepare Your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Application Online!, Am. \nImmigration Ctr., https://www.us-immigration.com/deferred-action-application-I-821D.jsp  (last \nvisited Sept. 18, 2017). \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 8 of 20\n \n27.  Applicants were required to send all the forms (including the I-821D form, the I-\n765 form, the I-765 worksheet and the G-1145 notification) to the USCIS for processing. The \nApplication Package Fee cost $170; processing the USCIS Application Fee cost $495. There was \nalso a Biometrics Fee of $85.3 With over 800,000 DACA registrants, those fees exceeded \n$604,000,000 in revenue for the United States. \n28.  After submitting all documentation to USCIS, applicants were then scheduled for \na “Biometric Services Appointment.” At this appointment, USCIS agents captured applicants’ \nsignatures, photographs, and fingerprints, using special machines designed to collect these \nbiometrics.4 \n29.  USCIS Agents sometimes requested DNA testing from applicants from \ndeveloping countries who did not have birth certificates, or “when there are suspicious \ndiscrepancies within the case.”5 \n30.  The successful DACA registrant received a “DACA Approval Notice” that lists \nonly “fraud or misrepresentation” as a basis for revoking their “lawful presence” in the country. \n31.  Once accepted into DACA, a registrant’s removal could not occur without \njustification and notice. The 2013 standard operating procedure (SOP) for the USCIS for DACA \nstates that removal needed to be based upon criminal, national security, or public safety issues, or \nfraud. Furthermore, and consistent with due process, the DACA registrant had to receive a \n“Notice of Intent to Terminate” that would thoroughly explain why USCIS was intending to \n                                                 \n3 Id. \n4 Preparing for Your Biometric Services Appointment, USCIS, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/forms/forms-information/preparing-your-biometric-services-\nappointment#What%20to%20Expect (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n5 What Happens at a USCIS Biometrics Appointment, Citizen Path, \nhttps://citizenpath.com/uscis-biometrics-appointment (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 9 of 20\n \nterminate the registrant from the program. The Notice would need to include a “fully \ndocumented SOF and any other relevant documents/information.” The DACA registrant then had \n33 days to submit any evidence that he or she felt could “overcome the grounds for termination.”  \n32.  The U.S. also promised DACA applicants that the information they provided \nwould not be used against them in deportation proceedings, or against their family \nmembers whose undocumented status could also be revealed by applying to the program. 6 \n33.  The commitment not to use biographical information against applicants was \nreiterated by then DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2016: “Since DACA was announced in 2012, \nDHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants will be collected and \nconsidered for the primary purpose of adjudicating their DACA requests and would be \nsafeguarded from other immigration-related purposes. More specifically, the U.S. government \nrepresented to applicants that personal information they provided will not later be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes except where it independently determines that a case \ninvolves a national security threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances \nwhere issuance of a notice to appear is required by law.”7  \n34.  Secretary Johnson explained that this was not just a DACA-related policy by \nDHS, but even its predecessor (INS) had a “long-standing and consistent practice” of not using \ninformation submitted by people seeking deferred action in enforcement actions. \n35.  Relying on these promises, DACA Program applicants and registrants provided \nthe federal government with extensive personal identifying information with the \n                                                 \n6 Frequently Asked Questions, USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-\nquestions, (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n7 Letter from Jeh Johnson, Sec’y, SEC, to Hon. Judy Chu (Dec. 30, 2016), \nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response%20to%20\nChu%2012.30.16.pdf. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 10 of 20\n \nunderstanding it would not be used to deport them.  \nB.  DACA Recipients Relied on the Government’s Promises When Investing in \nTheir Own Futures \n36.  Assured of indefinite deferral of any risk of deportation, immigrants who enrolled \nin DACA made investments in their education, property, and careers. \n37.   In an August 2017 survey, researcher Tom K. Wong found that: \n  Annual earnings had increased 80 percent under DACA — from an average of \n$20,000 to an average of $36,000; \n  65 percent of DACA recipients had purchased a first car; \n  16 percent had become homeowners; \n  5 percent had started their own businesses; \n  60 percent of DACA recipients above the age of 25 said that with DACA they’d \nbeen able to find jobs that better suited the education and training they already \nhad; and \n  61 percent said they’d been able to find jobs that suited the careers they wanted to \nhave.8 \n38.  In addition, about 900 DACA registrants are enrolled in the military.9 These \nenlistees are part of a Pentagon pilot project called Military Accessions Vital to the National \nInterest. The program waives certain citizenship requirements for green card holders, refugees \nand DACA recipients with skills that the military considers essential to the national interest. \n39.  Some of the DACA registrants who are members of the military are also members \nof the NAACP. \n                                                 \n8 See Tom K. Wong, et al., Results from T. Wong, et al. 2017 National DACA Study, Ctr for \nAm Progress, https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/08/27164928/Wong-Et-Al-\nNew-DACA-Survey-2017-Codebook.pdf (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n9 Gregory Korte, Alan Gomez and Kevin Johnson, Trump administration struggles with fate \nof 900 DREAMers serving in the military, USA Today (Sept. 7, 2017, 3:10 p.m.), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/07/trump-administration-struggles-fate-\n900-dreamers-serving-military/640637001/. \n10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 11 of 20\n \n40.  DACA registrants have thrived under DACA’s protections, in reliance on the \nUnited States’ promises. \n41.  DACA-recipients will be unable to sustain the lives they have built once their \nability to work legally is taken away with the rescission of DACA. In addition, the rescission will \nplace severe burdens on employers, putting them in a position of having to terminate valuable \nand productive employees while scrambling to fill both high-skilled and entry-level vacancies in \ntheir labor force. \nC.  DACA Registrants and Applicants Now Face Imminent Threat of \nDeportation \n \n42.  Despite the United States’ promises and DACA registrants’ reliance on those \npromises, on September 5, 2017, Defendant Sessions announced that the DACA program was \nbeing terminated, and the Trump administration began the countdown to deportment for DACA \nregistrants and applicants.  \n1.  DACA Applicants  \n43.  As of the date of Defendant Sessions’ announcement on September 5, 2017, no \nnew DACA applications will be accepted or processed.10  \n44.  Thus, potential registrants who have submitted an application, but whose \napplication has not yet been processed, will not enjoy any DACA protection.  \n45.  Nevertheless, because USCIS has access to an enormous amount of DACA \napplicants’ personally identifying information, including the fact that they are otherwise \nundocumented, these applicants are at a dramatically increased risk of deportation. \n2.  DACA Registrants \n                                                 \n10 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 2017 Announcement, USCIS, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/daca2017 (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 12 of 20\n \n46.  Following the September 5, 2017 announcement, DACA and work permits will \nonly remain valid for registrants until their expiration date.11 \n47.  Registrants whose permits are set to expire before March 5, 2018 must apply for a \ntwo-year renewal by October 5, 2017. 12 \n48.  Following the September 5, 2017 announcement, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will no longer grant DACA registrants permission to travel abroad through DACA’s \n“Advance Parole” program. Moreover, any pending applications for Advance Parole will not be \nprocessed.13 \nD.  DACA Registrants Consist Mostly of Immigrants of Color \n49.  Nearly all of the DACA registrants—more than 95%—are people of color. These \n95% of DACA registrants come from Africa and the Caribbean, Central and South America, \nEast. \n50.  The termination of DACA will disproportionately affect immigrants of color.. \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I  \nDECLARATORY RELIEF PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §2201 \n51.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n52.  DACA  applicants  and  registrants  provided  biographical  and  biometric \ninformation about themselves and family members to USCIS and DHS at the time of their \napplication.  \n                                                 \n11 Id. \n12 Id. \n13 Id. \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 13 of 20\n \n53.  DACA applicants have been told that they must provide any renewals for work \nauthorizations by October 5, 2017. \n54.  Defendants have heretofore made assurances that information provided to them as \npart of the DACA program would not be used against them or their family in any deportation \nproceedings. \n55.  As former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson assured: “Since DACA was announced in \n2012, DHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants will be collected \nand considered for the primary purpose of adjudicating their DACA requests and would be \nsafeguarded from other immigration-related purposes. More specifically, the U.S. government \nrepresented to applicants that personal information they provided will not later be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes except where it independently determine that a case involves \na national security threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance \nof a notice to appear is required by law.” \n56.  In the current version of Frequently Asked Questions published by USCIS and \nDHS, DACA applicants are told that “Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA \nwill not be referred to ICE,” and that, “information related to your family members or guardians \nthat  is  contained  in  your  request  will  not  be  referred  to  ICE  for  purposes  of  immigration \nenforcement against family members or guardians.” \n57.  Notwithstanding these assurances, termination of DACA Program is accompanied \nby withdrawal of the guarantee that information provided by DACA applicants and registrants in \ndeportation proceedings. \n58.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of their respective members who are DACA applicants and \nregistrants,  seek  a  declaration  that  the  Defendants  may  not  use  information  about  their \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 14 of 20\n \nimmigration  status  and  means  of  contacting  them  and  their  families  in  any  deportation \nproceedings that may ensue after the DACA program has ended.   \nCOUNT II  \nVIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n59.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n60.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nprohibits the Government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due \nprocess of law. \n61.  All DACA registrants relied upon promises made by Federal immigration \nauthorities and the Department of Justice. These included promises not to use information \nagainst them or family members in enforcement proceedings; promises not to terminate them \nfrom the DACA program without justification and notice; and a promise to provide employment \nauthorization to those eligible. \n62.  As a result of the Defendants’ promises regarding the DACA program, DACA \napplicants voluntarily provided potentially incriminating information to the Defendants that they \nwould not have otherwise provided. \n63.  As a result of the Defendants’ promises regarding the DACA Program, DACA \nregistrants obtained employment authorizations, and purchased property, such as cars and homes. \nSome also paid college tuition with the expectation that it would eventually lead to graduation \nwith a degree. \n64.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment also requires that immigration \nenforcement actions taken by the federal government be fundamentally fair and neither arbitrary \nnor capricious. \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 15 of 20\n \n65.  Defendants will violate the Due Process Clause when they use in deportation \nproceedings any information provided by DACA applicants that the Defendants elicited through \npromises that such information would not be used for that purpose. \n66.  Defendants have also violated the Due Process Clause by reneging on promises \nthat applicants allowed to register in the DACA program could only be deprived of their status as \nlawfully present if there was an issue of fraud, criminal, national security, or public safety issue. \nMoreover, termination required a “notice of an intent to terminate” that provided all reasons and \ndocuments supporting the determination. Further, DACA registrants were to be given an \nopportunity to submit evidence rebutting that determination. The DHS rescission memorandum \nremoves the lawful presence status afforded the DACA registrant and subjects them to an \nimminent risk of deportation. \n67.  Defendants’ rescission of the DACA program and safeguards to immigrants who \nqualified as lawfully present residents, absent any cause or justification particular to them, \nrenders this action arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the guarantee of due process by the \nFifth Amendment. \n68.  Defendants’ rescission of the DACA program, and the imminent threat of \ndeportation to its registrants and applicants, causes ongoing harm to those DACA program \nregistrants and applicants who are members of the Plaintiffs’ organizations. \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nAND (D) \n69.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n70.  Rescission of the DACA program is governed by the Administrative Procedure \nAct, as it constitutes an agency action, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 551(13), and constitutes a rule \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 16 of 20\n \nmaking, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 551(5).   \n71.  As the action to rescind the DACA program fails to be supported by, or even \naccompanied by, a rationale that justifies the withdrawal of a longstanding program lawfully \ninstituted and which engendered serious reliance interests by its participants,  it is arbitrary, \ncapricious and an abuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \n72.  In addition, the action to rescind the DACA program constitutes a rulemaking \nwithin the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act because it forbids DHS from continuing \nto defer deportation of individuals who were lawful registrants of the DACA program.   \n73.  As rescission of the DACA program was undertaken without first submitting the \naction for notice and public comment, it violates Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure \nAct and constitutes an unlawful rulemaking. \n74.  Defendants’ violation of the APA causes ongoing harm to the Plaintiffs and \nDACA registrants and applicants that are members of Plaintiffs’ organizations. \nCOUNT IV  \nVIOLATION OF THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 601 \n75.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n76.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), requires federal \nagencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \nfinal versions of those analyses for public comment. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n77.  “Small entities” for purposes of the RFA includes small businesses, small \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions. 5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n78.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 17 of 20\n \nunder the RFA. 5 U.S.C. § 601(2). \n79.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DACA rescission are likely to \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, like the Plaintiff \norganizations. 5 U.S.C. § 602(a)(1). \n80.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules. \n81.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \nviolates the RFA and is unlawful. \n82.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the DACA registrants and \napplicants employed by or members of Plaintiffs’ non-profit organizations. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \na)  Declare that the DHS Memorandum rescinding the DACA program is \nunauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States; \nb)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are procedurally unlawful under the APA; \nc)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are substantively unlawful under the APA; \nd)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are unlawful under the RFA; \ne)  Enjoin Defendants from rescinding the DACA program, pending further orders \nfrom this Court; \nf)  Enjoin Defendants from using  information obtained in any DACA application \nor renewal request to identify, apprehend, detain, or deport any DACA registrant \n17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 10   Filed 10/24/17   Page 18 of 20\n \nor applicant or member of any DACA applicant’s family, or take any action \nagainst a DACA applicant’s current or former employer; and \ng)  Award such additional relief as deemed just and appropriate. \n \nOctober 23, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Joseph M.

Hope Drive,  \nBaltimore, MD  21215  \n \nPlaintiff, \nvs. \nDONALD J.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”) \nbrings this action in its organizational capacity against the President of the United States and the \nfederal government for unlawfully reneging on their promise to protect young, undocumented \nimmigrants of color living in the United States. This action alleges violations of the Due Process \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 2 of 17\n \nClause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. This action also seeks declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201. \n2.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) refers to the United \nStates’ immigration policy concerning undocumented immigrants who arrived in America as \nchildren.  Under this policy, people who immigrated to the United States when they were \nyounger than 16 and have lived in the United States continuously since 2007 were eligible to \ndefer deportation indefinitely, attend school, and receive two-year work permits, among other \nbenefits.  \n3.  The vast majority of DACA registrants—approximately 95%—are people of \ncolor. The top 24 countries with the highest acceptance rates for DACA applicants include \npredominately Black countries in Africa and the Caribbean, predominately Latino countries in \nSouth and Central America, and countries in East and Southeast Asia.1 \n4.  In exchange for providing the federal government with extensive biographic and \nbiometric information, DACA registrants2  received the United States’ promise that they could \nbuild lives for themselves in the United States without fear of prosecution or deportation. \n5.  However, a little less than two weeks ago, the President of the United States and \nthe United States Attorney General announced their intention to renege on those promises. \n6.  On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, on behalf of President \nDonald Trump, announced that the Trump Administration was rescinding the DACA program. \n                                                 \n1 Eugene Scott, ‘Dreamers’ aren’t just coming from Latin America, WASH. POST (Sept. 7, \n2017), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/07/dreamers-arent-just-\ncoming-from-latin-america/?utm_term=.223e28c69e55. \n2 The children of undocumented parents who were brought to this country and grew up here \nbecame known as DREAMers, after the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation meant to give them a \npath to citizenship that was first introduced in 2001. Approximately 1.3 million Dreamers were \neligible to enroll in DACA, and to date approximately 800,000 have done so. \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 3 of 17\n \nThe same day, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a memorandum \nmemorializing the rescission. The Attorney General announced that, effective immediately, DHS \nwould stop processing or accepting new DACA applications, cease allowing DACA registrants \nto visit their families abroad and return to the United States, and issue renewals only for \nregistrants whose terms expired before March 5, 2018 as long as they applied for renewal by \nOctober 5, 2018.  \n7.  The Trump Administration announced this rescission without regard to the Due \nProcess rights of the DACA registrants, and without engaging in the analysis or rulemaking \nprocedures required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, \nboth of which were enacted to safeguard against government action taken without a legitimate \nand reasoned basis.   \n8.  As a result, the NAACP, whose membership includes DACA registrants across \nthe United States, respectfully requests that this Court declare the termination of the DACA \nprogram unlawful, and enjoin the Trump Administration from effectuating its rescission. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n10.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and \n1391(e)(1). Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. \nSeveral Defendant agencies are residents of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the District of Columbia. \nIII.  PARTIES \n11.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is \nthe nation’s largest and oldest civil rights grassroots organization. Since its founding in 1909, the \nmission of the NAACP has been to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 4 of 17\n \nequality of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination. The NAACP has fought in the \ncourts for decades to protect the guarantee of equal protection under law. To advance its mission, \nthe  NAACP has represented parties in landmark civil rights cases, perhaps most famously in \nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which outlawed segregation in \npublic schools. The NAACP also has filed numerous amicus briefs over its decades of existence \nin cases that significantly impact people of color. \n12.  NAACP has members throughout the country who are enrolled in the DACA \nProgram. Accordingly, the NAACP brings this action on behalf of those members who are \ncurrently enrolled in, and who applied to enroll in, the DACA Program. NAACP members who \nare DACA registrants reside throughout the United States, including in California, Florida, New \nYork, and Rhode Island, as well as other States. \n13.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He authorized \nthe issuance of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Memorandum that purports to \nrescind DACA. He is being sued in his official capacity. \n14.  Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, and announced the rescission of the DACA Program on September 5, 2017. He \nhas ultimate authority over prosecutions by the Department of Justice for violation of the \nimmigration laws. He is being sued in his official capacity. \n15.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke is the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”). She is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Immigration and \nNationality Act, and oversees the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) \nand the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). She is being sued in her official \ncapacity. \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 5 of 17\n \n16.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing the \nDACA program. DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government, and is \nan agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n17.  Defendant USCIS is an Operational and Support Component agency within DHS. \nUSCIS is the sub-agency responsible for administering the DACA program. \n18.  Defendant ICE is an Operational and Support Component agency within DHS. \nICE is responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, including identifying, apprehending, \ndetaining, and removing non-citizens. \n19.  Defendant the United States of America includes all government agencies and \ndepartments responsible for the implementation and rescission of the DACA program. \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The DACA Program Promised Young Immigrants Opportunities and \nIndefinite Deferral of Deportation in Exchange for Registration in the DACA \nProgram and Disclosure of Their Immigration Status \n20.  On June 15, 2012, former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, \nissued a memorandum establishing a deferred deportation program. She inveighed against \n“blindly enforc[ing]” immigration laws to deport those who came to the United States as \nchildren, and who have been productive Americans. As part of exercising prosecutorial \ndiscretion, the government developed a program that must be meet by Dreamers:  \na.  That they were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; \nb.  That they entered the United States prior to their 16th birthday; \nc.  That they had resided in the United States since June 15, 2007 and were currently \npresent in the U.S.; \nd.  That they were in the United States on June 15, 2012 and physically in the U.S. at \nthe time they requested deferred action; \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 6 of 17\n \ne.  That they entered the United States without border inspection before June 15, \n2012, or their immigration status expired prior to June 15, 2012; \nf.  That they were currently in school, have graduated, or obtained an equivalent \ncertificate of completion from high school, successfully obtained a general education \ndevelopment (GED) certificate, or must have been honorably discharged from the Armed \nServices of the United States; and \ng.  That they must not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, \nthree or more other misdemeanors, and must not pose a threat to national security or \npublic safety.3 \n21.  In addition to meeting these requirements, DACA recipients must provide the \nfollowing as part of the application process: financial records, medical records, school records \n(diploma, report card, GED certificate, high-school transcript), employment records, or military \nrecords (personnel records, health record). \n22.  Applicants are also required to provide biographical information, including the \ndate of their arrival in the country, previous departures and previous addresses for both \nthemselves and those with whom they traveled. \n23.  Applicants are required to send all the forms (including the I-821D form, the I-\n765 form, the I-765 worksheet and the G-1145 notification) to the USCIS for processing. The \nApplication Package Fee cost $170; processing the USCIS Application Fee cost $495. There is \n                                                 \n3 Prepare Your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Application Online!, AM. \nIMMIGRATION CTR., https://www.us-immigration.com/deferred-action-application-I-821D.jsp  \n(last visited Sept. 18, 2017). \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 7 of 17\n \nalso a Biometrics Fee of $85.4 With over 800,000 DACA registrants, those fees exceeded \n$604,000,000 in revenue paid to the United States. \n24.  After submitting all documentation to USCIS, applicants are then scheduled for a \n“Biometric Services Appointment.” At this appointment, USCIS agents recorded applicants’ \nsignatures, photographs, and fingerprints.5 \n25.  USCIS Agents sometimes request samples of DNA for applicants from \ndeveloping countries who did not have birth certificates, or “when there are suspicious \ndiscrepancies within the case.”6 \n26.  The successful DACA registrant receives a “DACA Approval Notice” that lists \nonly “fraud or misrepresentation” as a basis for revoking their “lawful presence” in the country. \n27.  Once accepted into the DACA Program, a registrant can only be removed from \nthe program after being provided notice and only on grounds prescribed in the Program rules.  \nThe 2013 standard operating procedure (SOP) for the USCIS for the DACA Program states that \nremoval was to be based upon criminal, national security, or public safety risks, or fraud. \nFurthermore, and consistent with due process, the DACA registrant had to receive a “Notice of \nIntent to Terminate” that would thoroughly explain why USCIS was intending to terminate the \nregistrant from the program. The Notice would need to include a “fully documented SOF and \nany other relevant documents/information.” The DACA registrant then had 33 days to submit \nevidence to “overcome the grounds for termination.”  \n                                                 \n4 Id. \n5 Preparing for Your Biometric Services Appointment, USCIS, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/forms/forms-information/preparing-your-biometric-services-\nappointment#What%20to%20Expect (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n6 What Happens at a USCIS Biometrics Appointment, CITIZEN PATH, \nhttps://citizenpath.com/uscis-biometrics-appointment (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 8 of 17\n \n28.  The U.S. also promised DACA applicants that the information they provided \nwould not be used against them in deportation proceedings, or against their family members \nwhose undocumented status could also be revealed by applying to the program. 7 \n29.  The commitment not to use biographical information against applicants was \nreiterated by then DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2016: “Since DACA was announced in 2012, \nDHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants will be collected and \nconsidered for the primary purpose of adjudicating their DACA requests and would be \nsafeguarded from other immigration-related purposes. More specifically, the U.S. government \nrepresented to applicants that personal information they provided will not later be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes except where it independently determines that a case \ninvolves a national security threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances \nwhere issuance of a notice to appear is required by law.”8  \n30.  Secretary Johnson explained that this policy, articulated in connection with the \nDACA Program, was a “long-standing and consistent practice” followed by the predecessor INS \nto not use information submitted by people seeking deferred action in enforcement actions. \n31.  Relying on these promises, DACA Program applicants and registrants provided \nthe federal government with extensive personal identifying information with the understanding it \nwould not be used to deport them.  \n \n                                                 \n7 Frequently Asked Questions, USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-\nquestions, (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017).  \n \n8 Letter from Jeh Johnson, Sec’y, SEC, to Hon. Judy Chu (Dec. 30, 2016), \nhttps://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response%20to%20\nChu%2012.30.16.pdf. \n8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 9 of 17\n \nB.  DACA Program Registrants Relied on the Government’s Promises When \nThey Invested in Their Futures in the United States \n32.  Assured of indefinite deferral of any risk of deportation, immigrants who enrolled \nin DACA made investments in their education, property, and careers. \n33.   In an August 2017 survey, researcher Tom K. Wong found that: \n•  Annual earnings had increased 80 percent under DACA — from an average of \n$20,000 to an average of $36,000; \n•  65 percent of DACA Program registrants had purchased a first car; \n•  16 percent had become homeowners; \n•  5 percent had started their own businesses; \n•  60 percent of DACA Program registrants above the age of 25 said that, relying on \ndeferral of deportation, they had been able to find jobs that better suited their \neducation and training; and \n•  61 percent said they had been able to find jobs that suited the careers they wanted \nto have.9 \n34.  In addition, about 900 DACA registrants are members of the military.10 These \nenlistees are part of a Pentagon pilot project called Military Accessions Vital to the National \nInterest. The program waives certain citizenship requirements for green card holders, refugees \nand DACA Program registrants with skills that the military considers essential to the national \ninterest. \n35.  Some of the DACA registrants who are members of the military are also members \nof the NAACP. \n                                                 \n9 See Tom K. Wong, et al., Results from T.

PROGRESS, https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/08/27164928/Wong-\nEt-Al-New-DACA-Survey-2017-Codebook.pdf (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017). \n10 Gregory Korte, Alan Gomez and Kevin Johnson, Trump administration struggles with fate \nof 900 DREAMers serving in the military, USA TODAY (Sept. 7, 2017, 3:10 p.m.), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/07/trump-administration-struggles-fate-\n900-dreamers-serving-military/640637001/. \n9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 10 of 17\n \n36.  DACA registrants have thrived under the program’s protections, secure in the \nknowledge that the disclosures they made to the government would not be used to deport them. \nC.  DACA Registrants and Applicants Now Face Imminent Threat of \nDeportation \n37.  Despite the United States’ promises and DACA registrants’ reliance on those \npromises, on September 5, 2017, Defendant Sessions announced that the DACA program was \nbeing terminated, and the Trump administration began the countdown to deporting  DACA \nregistrants and applicants.  \n1.  DACA Applicants  \n38.  As of the date of Defendant Sessions’ announcement on September 5, 2017, no \nnew DACA applications will be accepted or processed.11  \n39.  Thus, potential registrants who have submitted an application, but whose \napplication has not yet been processed, will not enjoy any DACA protection.  \n40.  Nevertheless, because USCIS has access to personal identifying information of \nDACA Program applicants, including their immigration status, these applicants are subject to \nheightened risk of deportation. \n2.  DACA Registrants \n41.  Following the September 5, 2017 announcement, DACA and work permits will \nonly remain valid for registrants until their expiration date.12 \n42.  Registrants whose permits are set to expire before March 5, 2018 must apply for a \ntwo-year renewal by October 5, 2017. 13 \n                                                 \n11 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 2017 Announcement, USCIS, \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/daca2017 (last accessed Sept. 18, 2017).  \n12 Id. \n13 Id. \n10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 11 of 17\n \n43.  Following the September 5, 2017 announcement, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will no longer grant DACA registrants permission to travel abroad through DACA’s \n“Advance Parole” program. Moreover, any pending applications for Advance Parole will not be \nprocessed.14 \nD.  DACA Registrants Consist Mostly of Immigrants of Color \n44.  Nearly all of the DACA registrants—more than 95%—are people of color. These \n95% of DACA registrants come from Africa and the Caribbean, Central and South America, East \nAsia and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. \n45.  The termination of the DACA Program will therefore disproportionately harm \nimmigrants of color. \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I  \nDECLARATORY RELIEF PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §2201 \n46.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n47.  DACA  applicants  and  registrants  provided  biographical  and  biometric \ninformation about themselves and family members to USCIS and DHS at the time of their \napplication.  \n48.  DACA applicants have been told that they must submit requests to renew work \nauthorizations by October 5, 2017. \n49.  Defendants have made assurances that information provided to DHS by DACA \nProgram  applicants  would  not  be  used  against  them  or  their  family  in  any  deportation \nproceedings. \n                                                 \n14 Id. \n11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 12 of 17\n \n50.  As former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson assured: “Since DACA was announced in \n2012, DHS has consistently made clear that information provided by applicants will be collected \nand considered for the primary purpose of adjudicating their DACA requests and would be \nsafeguarded from other immigration-related purposes. More specifically, the U.S. government \nrepresented to applicants that personal information they provided will not later be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes except where it independently determine that a case involves \na national security threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance \nof a notice to appear is required by law.” \n51.  In the current version of Frequently Asked Questions published by USCIS and \nDHS, DACA applicants are told that “Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA \nwill not be referred to ICE,” and that, “information related to your family members or guardians \nthat  is  contained  in  your  request  will  not  be  referred  to  ICE  for  purposes  of  immigration \nenforcement against family members or guardians.” \n52.  Notwithstanding  these  assurances,  termination  of  the  DACA  Program  is \naccompanied by withdrawal of the guarantee that information provided by DACA applicants and \nregistrants will not be used in deportation proceedings. \n53.  The NAACP, on behalf of its members who are DACA applicants and registrants, \nseeks a declaration that the Defendants may not use information about their immigration status \nand means of contacting them and their families in any deportation proceedings that may ensue \nafter the DACA program has ended.   \nCOUNT II  \nVIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n54.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 13 of 17\n \n55.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nprohibits the Government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due \nprocess of law. \n56.  All DACA registrants relied upon promises made by Federal immigration \nauthorities and the Department of Justice. These included promises not to use information about \ntheir immigration status and other personal characteristics against them or family members in \nenforcement proceedings; promises not to terminate them from the DACA program without \njustification and notice; and a promise to provide employment authorization to those eligible. \n57.  As a result of the Defendants’ promises regarding the DACA program, DACA \napplicants voluntarily provided potentially incriminating information to the Defendants that they \nwould not have otherwise provided. \n58.  As a result of the Defendants’ promises regarding the DACA Program, DACA \nregistrants obtained employment authorizations, and purchased property, such as cars and homes. \nSome also paid college tuition with the expectation that it would eventually lead to graduation \nwith a degree. \n59.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment also requires that immigration \nenforcement actions taken by the federal government be fundamentally fair and neither arbitrary \nnor capricious. \n60.  Defendants will violate the Due Process Clause when they use in deportation \nproceedings any information provided by DACA applicants that the Defendants elicited through \npromises that such information would not be used for that purpose. \n61.  Defendants have also violated the Due Process Clause by reneging on promises \nthat applicants allowed to register in the DACA program could only be deprived of their status as \n13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 14 of 17\n \nlawfully present if there was an issue of fraud, criminal, national security, or public safety issue. \nMoreover, termination required a “notice of an intent to terminate” that provided all reasons and \ndocuments supporting the determination.  Further, DACA registrants were to be given an \nopportunity to submit evidence rebutting that determination. The DHS rescission memorandum \nremoves the lawful presence status afforded the DACA registrant and subjects them to an \nimminent risk of deportation. \n62.  Defendants’ rescission of the DACA program and safeguards to immigrants who \nqualified as lawfully present residents, absent any cause or justification particular to them, \nrenders this action arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n63.  Defendants’ rescission of the DACA program, and the imminent threat of \ndeportation to its registrants and applicants, causes ongoing harm to those DACA program \nregistrants and applicants who are members of the Plaintiff. \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) AND (D) \n64.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n65.  Rescission of the DACA program is governed by the Administrative Procedure \nAct, as it constitutes an agency action, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 551(13), and constitutes a rule \nmaking, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 551(5).   \n66.  As the action to rescind the DACA program fails to be supported by, or even \naccompanied by, a rationale that justifies the withdrawal of a longstanding program lawfully \ninstituted and which engendered serious reliance interests by its participants,  it is arbitrary, \n14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 15 of 17\n \ncapricious and an abuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \n67.  In addition, the action to rescind the DACA program constitutes a rulemaking \nwithin the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act because it forbids DHS from continuing \nto defer deportation of individuals who were lawful registrants of the DACA program.   \n68.  As rescission of the DACA program was undertaken without first submitting the \naction for notice and public comment, it violates Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure \nAct and constitutes an unlawful rulemaking. \n69.  Defendants’ violation of the APA causes ongoing harm to the Plaintiff and DACA \nregistrants and applicants that are members of Plaintiff’s organization. \nCOUNT IV  \nVIOLATION OF THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 601 \n70.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n71.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (“RFA”), requires federal \nagencies to analyze the impact of rules they promulgate on small entities and publish initial and \nfinal versions of those analyses for public comment. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n72.  “Small entities” for purposes of the RFA includes small businesses, small \nnonprofits, and small governmental jurisdictions. 5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n73.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum are “rules” \nunder the RFA. 5 U.S.C. § 601(2). \n74.  The actions that DHS has taken to implement the DACA rescission are likely to \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, like the Plaintiff. 5 \nU.S.C. § 602(a)(1). \n15 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 16 of 17\n \n75.  Defendants have not issued the required analyses of DHS’s new rules. \n76.  Defendants’ failure to issue the initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses \nviolates the RFA and is unlawful. \n77.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the DACA registrants and \napplicants employed by or members of Plaintiff’s non-profit organization \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Plaintiff prays that the Court: \na)  Declare that the DHS Memorandum rescinding the DACA program is \nunauthorized by and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States; \nb)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are procedurally unlawful under the APA; \nc)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are substantively unlawful under the APA; \nd)  Declare that the actions that DHS has taken to implement the DHS Memorandum \nrescinding the DACA program are unlawful under the RFA; \ne)  Enjoin Defendants from rescinding the DACA program, pending further orders \nfrom this Court; \nf)  Enjoin Defendants from using  information obtained in any DACA application \nor renewal request to identify, apprehend, detain, or deport any DACA registrant \nor applicant or member of any DACA applicant’s family, or take any action \nagainst a DACA applicant’s current or former employer; and   \n16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 1   Filed 09/18/17   Page 17 of 17\n \n \ng)  Award such additional relief as deemed just and appropriate. \n \nSeptember 18, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n     \n   \n       /s/ Joseph M.

DACA made deferred action—a \npractice  by  which  the  Secretary  exercises  individualized  enforcement  discretion  to  issue  a \nreversible notification that she does not intend to remove an alien for a set period of time—\navailable to a class of unlawfully present aliens who came to the United States as children.  In \n2014, one of her successors expanded the parameters of DACA and adopted a similar policy known \nas DAPA, or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans.  DAPA, if implemented, would have made \ndeferred action available to unlawfully present aliens who were parents of U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents. \nDAPA, including its expansion of DACA, was promptly challenged by a coalition of 26 \nstates.  Although then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson vigorously defended the \npolicy, he was rebuffed at every turn:  the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas \nissued a nationwide preliminary injunction; the Fifth Circuit  affirmed, declaring the policy \n“manifestly contrary” to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); and an equally divided \nSupreme Court affirmed, leaving the injunction in place. \nArmed with this victory, the states threatened to amend their complaint to challenge not \njust DAPA, but DACA as well, arguing that it suffers from the same infirmities.  In view of the \nsubstantial similarities between the two policies, the significant litigation risk posed by the \nSupreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions, and the Attorney General’s view that DACA was in \nfact unlawful, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke was faced with two options.  \nOn the one hand, she could wind down DACA in an orderly fashion, minimizing the disruption to \n 1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 15 of 58\n \ncurrent recipients.  On the other, continued litigation would in all likelihood result in a nationwide \ninjunction abruptly ending the policy, plunging its nearly 800,000 recipients into uncertainty. \nThe Acting Secretary chose the less disruptive option: an orderly process that formally \nrescinds DACA but allows it to sunset.  Under this Rescission Policy, no DACA recipient will \nhave his or her deferred action abruptly terminated based solely on the Rescission Policy; instead, \nprior grants will remain valid for the remainder of their stated duration (generally two years) before \nending consistent with their stated terms.  Any DACA recipient whose deferred action was due to \nexpire within six months was given a month to request another two-year renewal.  And although \nthe agency stopped accepting new DACA requests, it will finish processing those it had received \nwhen the rescission began. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs—the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \nthe American Federation of Teachers, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International \nUnion—challenge the Rescission Policy on a variety of statutory and constitutional grounds, \nurging the Court to invalidate the policy and enjoin the Acting Secretary from rescinding DACA.  \nThere is no basis to do so. \nTo begin, this case should be dismissed at the outset for lack of standing.  Plaintiffs declare \nthat they bring this case in their organizational capacities, yet they identify no injury whatsoever \nto their own interests as organizations, and their missions have no apparent nexus to the subject of \nthe suit.  And to the extent that Plaintiffs are suing in their representative capacities, they fail to \nname any of their members, much less one actually harmed by the Rescission Policy.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs establish no cognizable injury, and they should not be heard to air their disagreements \nwith the Acting Secretary’s policy choices here. \n 2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 16 of 58\n \nIn any event, this case is not justiciable.  The Rescission Policy is a classic exercise of \nenforcement discretion “presumed immune from judicial review,” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n821, 831–32 (1985), and particularly unfettered in the context of immigration, see Reno v. Am.-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (AADC), 525 U.S. 471, 487–92 (1999).  In fact, Congress has \nstripped district courts of jurisdiction to review “‘no deferred action’ decisions and similar \ndiscretionary determinations” such as the one here.  Id. at 485; see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  The Court \nshould not permit Plaintiffs to circumvent these bedrock limits on judicial review. \nOn the merits, Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law.  Their claim that the Rescission \nPolicy is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was \ninadequately supported on the record is fundamentally misguided.  Agencies are always free to \nchange course on policy matters so long as they provide a rational explanation.  Here, the Acting \nSecretary’s explanation of her decision to rescind DACA amply meets that deferential standard, \nparticularly given the adverse ruling from the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court’s affirmance, \nthe evident similarities between DACA and the policy that expanded DACA and created DAPA, \nthe Attorney General’s opinion that DACA was likewise unlawful, and the imminent risk of a \nnationwide injunction with potentially chaotic results.  Because this claim can be resolved now \nbased on the complaint, the documents incorporated therein by reference, and other judicially \nnoticeable materials—including those in the administrative record, served contemporaneously \nherewith—the Court should either uphold the Rescission Policy and grant this motion if it agrees \nthat the record supports Defendants’ position, or set aside the Rescission Policy if it disagrees. \nPlaintiffs’ notice-and-comment claim is equally unavailing.  The APA exempts “general \nstatements of policy” from notice and comment, 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), and the Rescission Policy is a \nreordering of enforcement priorities that readily qualifies.  Indeed, the Department of Homeland \n 3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 17 of 58\n \nSecurity (DHS) and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) have adopted more \nthan 20 deferred action or similar policies over the past 50 years.  Few have gone through notice \nand comment, and there is no warrant for those procedures here.  Nor does the Fifth Circuit’s ruling \nthat the plaintiffs there established a likelihood of success on their claim that the promulgation of \nDAPA required notice and comment mean that the rescission of DACA and a return to the status \nquo ante must likewise meet these procedural demands.  Plaintiffs’ Regulatory Flexibility Act \nclaim fails for the same reason, as that Act applies only where notice and comment is required.  \nAnd in any event, if DACA’s rescission required notice and comment, then DACA was void from \nthe outset because its adoption would also have required notice and comment a fortiori. \nPlaintiffs’ due process claim gets it no further.  DACA recipients have no protected liberty \nor property interest in the continued receipt of deferred action, which is an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion that confers no rights and is revocable at any time.  Regardless, broad-based changes in \nagency policy like the Rescission Policy do not require individualized process.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ \nseparate “claim” for a declaratory judgment is a nonstarter, as a declaratory judgment is a form of \nrelief, not an independent cause of action. \nIn sum, even if Plaintiffs’ challenge were somehow justiciable, the assumption underlying \nit would compel dismissal.  DAPA—including its expansion of DACA—was enjoined by the Fifth \nCircuit, and that holding was affirmed by the Supreme Court.  The original DACA policy is \nmaterially indistinguishable as a legal matter.  At bottom, Plaintiffs’ argument is that, when making \ndiscretionary enforcement determinations, federal agencies must ignore the legal rulings and \nreasoning of federal courts.  To state the premise of this claim is to refute it.  This case should be \ndismissed. \n 4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 18 of 58\n \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Deferred Action Generally \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is charged “with the administration and enforcement” \nof the INA along with “all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  Under these laws, individuals are subject to removal if, among other things, \n“they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other \ncriteria set by federal law.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012) (citation omitted); \nsee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a). \nDue to resource constraints, the federal government cannot remove every removable alien, \nwhich means that a “principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by \nimmigration officials.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396 (citation omitted).  DHS officials must first \n“decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all,” id., and once proceedings begin, they \nmay decide to grant certain forms of discretionary relief expressly authorized by statute, such as \nasylum, parole, or cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1182(d)(5)(A), 1229b.  “At \neach stage” of the process, “the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor” entirely.  \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 483.   \n“One form of discretion the Secretary of Homeland Security exercises is ‘deferred action,’ \nwhich entails temporarily postponing the removal of individuals unlawfully present in the United \nStates.”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 136 \nS. Ct. 900 (2016).  Deferred action is a practice by which the Acting Secretary exercises her \n“discretion to abandon” the removal process, and to notify an individual alien of a non-binding \ndecision to forbear from seeking his removal for a set period.  AADC, 525 U.S. at 483; see 8 C.F.R. \n§ 274a.12(c)(14) (describing “deferred action” as “an act of administrative convenience to the \n 5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 19 of 58\n \ngovernment which gives some cases lower priority”).  Although originally “developed without \nexpress statutory authorit[y],” AADC, 525 U.S. at 484, individualized deferred action has been \nrecognized  by  Congress  in  certain  circumstances  inapplicable  here,  see,  e.g.,  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (providing that certain individuals are “eligible for deferred action”), \nand described by the Supreme Court as an “exercise in administrative discretion,” AADC, 525 U.S. \nat 484.  Deferred action (or a similar form of relief) dates back to the 1960s, Arpaio, 797 F.3d at \n16, and DHS and the former INS have adopted over 20 such policies over the past 50 years—rarely \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking.1 \nA variety of consequences may flow from a decision to defer removal action, including the \nability to apply for work authorization, under DHS regulations not challenged here.  See, e.g., 8 \nC.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  That decision does not, however, confer lawful immigration status or \nprovide any defense to removal.  Cf. Chaudhry v. Holder, 705 F.3d 289, 292 (7th Cir. 2013) \n(discussing difference between “unlawful presence” and “unlawful status”).  To the contrary, \ndeferred action is “discretionary and reversible, and ‘confers no substantive right, immigration \nstatus or pathway to citizenship.’”  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 17 (citation omitted).  DHS thus has \ndiscretion to revoke deferred action unilaterally, for any reason or no reason, with or without \nnotice, and an individual with deferred action remains removable at any time.  See AADC, 525 \nU.S. at 484–85. \nB.  DACA and DAPA \nOn June 15, 2012, then-Secretary Napolitano announced the policy now known as DACA, \nor Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  See Admin. R. (AR) 1–3 (hereinafter DACA Memo).  \n                                                 \n1 See generally U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, The Department of Homeland \nSecurity’s Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present, 38 Op. O.L.C. \n1, 12–20 (Nov. 19, 2014) (OLC Op.), https://www.justice.gov/file/179206/download. \n 6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 20 of 58\n \nDACA made deferred action available to “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children” in violation of the immigration laws.  DACA Memo at 1 (AR 1).  Following \ncompletion of a background check, successful requestors would receive deferred action for a \nperiod of two years, subject to indefinite renewal.  Id. at 2–3 (AR 2–3). \nThe DACA Memo stated that deferred action was an “exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” \nid. at 1 (AR 1), and that requests for this relief would “be decided on a case by case basis,” id. at \n2 (AR 2).  Accordingly, the Memo provided that this grant of deferred action “confer[red] no \nsubstantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through \nits legislative authority, can confer these rights.”  Id. at 3 (AR 3). \nIn public guidance published on its website, DHS also informed DACA requestors that \ninformation in their requests will be “protected from disclosure to [Immigration & Customs \nEnforcement (ICE)] and [Customs & Border Protection (CBP)] for the purpose of immigration \nenforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice to \nAppear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance” (for \nexample, when issues of national security, public safety, or significant criminal activity are raised).  \nUSCIS, Frequently Asked Questions, (FAQ No. 19) (Oct. 6, 2017), [hereinafter DHS DACA \nFAQ],  https://go.usa.gov/xngCd;  see  USCIS,  Policy  Memorandum,  (Nov.  7,  2011), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xncPK (Notice to Appear Guidance).  DHS instructed, however, that this \ninformation-sharing policy creates no rights and “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at \nany time without notice.”  DHS DACA FAQ No. 19. \nIn 2014, then-Secretary Jeh Johnson expanded DACA and created a new, similar policy \nknown as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  \nSee AR 37–41 (“DAPA Memo”).  DAPA made deferred action available to certain unlawfully \n 7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 21 of 58\n \npresent aliens who were “parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.”  DAPA Memo \nat 3 (AR 39).  The DAPA Memo also expanded DACA by relaxing the eligibility criteria and \nextending the DACA renewal period from two to three years.  Id. at 3–4 (AR 39–40). \nC.  The Texas Litigation \nThe DAPA Memo—including its expansion of DACA—was challenged by a coalition of \n26 states, led by Texas, which sought to enjoin its implementation.  Affirming the district court, \nthe Fifth Circuit upheld a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the DAPA \nMemo.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Like the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Texas, the Fifth Circuit held that the promulgation of the DAPA Memo was \njusticiable, in part because it believed that “the INA’s intricate regulatory scheme for changing \nimmigration classifications” allowed the court to determine whether DHS had exceeded its \nstatutory authority.  Id. at 168.  It stressed, however, that “the denial of voluntary departure and \nwork authorization” would be unreviewable.  Id.  Also like the district court, the Fifth Circuit held \nthat the DAPA Memo failed to comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement, but \nemphasized that “DAPA is much more than a nonenforcement policy,” and that “a traditional \nnonenforcement policy would not necessarily be subject to notice and comment.”  Id. at 178 n.156.  \nAnd going beyond the district court, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA was “manifestly contrary” \nto the INA, in part because, unlike prior deferred-action policies that served as “bridges from one \nlegal status to another,” DAPA awarded deferred action “to persons who have never had a legal \nstatus and may never receive one.”  Id. at 184 (footnotes omitted).  \nThat decision was affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court, United States v. Texas, \n136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam), which later denied the government’s request for a rehearing \nupon confirmation of a ninth Justice, 137 S. Ct. 285 (2016), leaving the preliminary injunction in \n 8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 22 of 58\n \nplace.   On November  18, 2016, the parties jointly moved the district court to stay merits \nproceedings to allow them to evaluate “how they might choose to move forward” given the \nupcoming “change in Administration[s].”  Joint Mot. to Stay Merits ¶ 2, Texas v. United States, \nNo. 1:14-cv-254 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 18, 2016), ECF No. 430. \nFaced with continued litigation over a policy that had been enjoined by the courts, DHS \nrescinded the DAPA Memo on June 15, 2017, including its provisions expanding DACA.  See \nMemorandum for Kevin McAleenan, Acting Comm’r, U.S. Customs and Border Prot., et al., from \nJohn F. Kelly, Sec’y of Homeland Sec. (June 15, 2017) (AR 235–37).  Plaintiffs do not challenge \nthat decision here. \nOn June 29, 2017, Texas and several other states threatened to amend their complaint to \nalso challenge directly the DACA Memo, arguing that it suffers from the same legal infirmities as \nthe DAPA Memo.  See AR 238–40 (“Paxton Letter”). \nD.  Rescission of DACA \nFaced again with the prospect of continued litigation, Acting Secretary Duke decided on \nSeptember 5, 2017, to wind down the DACA policy in an orderly fashion.  See AR 252–56 \n(“Rescission Policy” or “Policy”).  As the Acting Secretary explained, “[t]aking into consideration \nthe Supreme Court’s and Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, \n2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Rescission Policy at 4 (AR 255).  Specifically, she quoted the Attorney General’s \nSeptember 4 recommendation to rescind DACA, which explained that because DACA “has the \nsame legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that \npotentially imminent litigation would yield similar results.”  Id. at 3 (AR 254).  Invoking her \n“authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities,” she rescinded the DACA \n 9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 23 of 58\n \nMemo, id. at 4 (AR 255), and instructed that deferred action should instead be provided “only on \nan individualized[,] case-by-case basis,” id. at 2 (AR 253). \nAt the same time, to facilitate an orderly transition, the Rescission Policy provides that: \n•  For current DACA recipients, DHS “[w]ill not terminate the grants of \npreviously issued deferred action or revoke Employment Authorization \nDocuments solely based on the directives in this memorandum for the \nremaining duration of their validity periods.”  Id. at 4 (AR 255). \n \n•  For initial DACA requests, DHS “[w]ill adjudicate—on an individual, case-\nby-case basis—properly filed pending DACA initial requests and associated \napplications for Employment Authorization Documents that have been \naccepted by [DHS] as of” September 5, 2017, but “[w]ill reject all DACA \ninitial requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization \nDocuments filed after” that date.  Id. \n \n•  For DACA renewal requests, DHS “[w]ill adjudicate—on an individual, \ncase by case basis—properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and \nassociated applications for Employment Authorization Documents from \ncurrent beneficiaries that have been accepted by [DHS] as of” September 5, \n2017.  Further, DHS will similarly adjudicate such requests and applications \n“from current beneficiaries whose [deferred  action under DACA] will \nexpire between [September 5, 2017,] and March 5, 2018[,] that have been \naccepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.”  Id. \n \nLike the DACA and DAPA Memos, the Rescission Policy notes that it “is not intended to, does \nnot,  and  may  not  be  relied  upon  to  create  any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural, \nenforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.”  Id. at 5 (AR 256).  \nAccordingly, DHS will “continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny \ndeferred action at any time.”  Id. at 4 (AR 255).  The Rescission Policy says nothing about (and \nmakes no changes to) DHS’s information-sharing policy. \nE.  This Action \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint raises four claims.  Count I seeks declaratory relief, but \nasserts no substantive cause of action.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51–58, ECF No. 10.  In Count II, \nPlaintiffs claim that the Rescission Policy violates due process by “reneging on promises” \nallegedly made to DACA recipients (a) not to use information from DACA applications in \n 10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 24 of 58\n \nimmigration enforcement proceedings, (b) not to terminate their DACA status without notice, and \n(c) to provide them with employment authorization documents.  Id. ¶ 66; see id. ¶¶ 59–68.  In \nCount III, Plaintiffs allege that the Rescission Policy violates the APA because (a) it was issued \nwithout notice and comment, and (b) it constitutes a change in agency policy without an adequate \nexplanation.  Id. ¶¶ 69–74.  In Count IV, Plaintiffs allege that the Rescission Policy violates the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act because it was unaccompanied by a regulatory flexibility analysis \nassessing its impact on small businesses.  Id. ¶¶ 75–82.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare the \nRescission Policy unlawful, see id. Prayer for Relief ¶¶ (a)–(d), and to “[e]njoin Defendants from \nrescinding the DACA” policy, id. ¶ (e). \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), a plaintiff must establish the Court’s \njurisdiction through sufficient allegations.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nWhen considering such a motion, the Court must accept all well-pleaded allegations as true.  See \nAm. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  The Court need not, however, \naccept inferences that are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint or that amount to mere \nlegal conclusions.  See Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In evaluating \nsubject-matter  jurisdiction,  the  court  may,  when  necessary,  look  beyond  the  complaint  to \n“undisputed facts evidenced in the record, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus \nthe court’s resolution of disputed facts.”  Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. \nCir. 1992). \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff’s complaint must contain \n“enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This “plausibility” standard “asks for more than a sheer possibility that \n 11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 25 of 58\n \na defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Where a \ncomplaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability, it ‘stops short of \nthe line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 557).  While the Court accepts well-pleaded factual allegations as true, “mere conclusory \nstatements” and “legal conclusion[s] couched as ... factual allegation[s]” are “disentitle[d] ... to \nth[is] presumption of truth.”  Id. at 678, 681 (citation omitted).  Although the Court generally may \nnot  rely  on  material  outside  the  pleadings  under  Rule  12(b)(6),  it  may  consider  materials \nincorporated into the complaint by reference, as well as judicially noticeable materials, without \nconverting the motion into one for summary judgment.  Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508 F.3d \n1052, 1059 (D.C. Cir. 2007). \nWith respect to Plaintiffs’ APA claims, “a court may consider the administrative record \nand public documents without converting the motion into a motion for summary judgment, or it \nmay convert the motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 12(d).”  Bates v. Donley, \n935 F. Supp. 2d 14, 17 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal citation omitted).  “[W]hen a party seeks review \nof agency action under the APA [before a district court], the district judge sits as an appellate \ntribunal.”  Rempfer v. Sharfstein, 583 F.3d 860, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (alterations in original) \n(citation omitted); see also Bates, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 17.  “The entire case on review is a question \nof law, and only a question of law.  And because a court can fully resolve any purely legal question \non a motion to dismiss, there is no inherent barrier to reaching the merits at the 12(b)(6) stage ... \nand there is no real distinction in this context between the question presented on a 12(b)(6) motion \nand a motion for summary judgment.” Marshall Cty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, \n1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).  Under these circumstances, review “is based on the \nagency record and limited to determining whether the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously.”  \n 12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 26 of 58\n \nRempfer, 583 F.3d at 865; see also Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev. v. Shalala, 173 F.3d 438, 440 n.3 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (explaining that when reviewing agency action the question whether the agency \nacted in an arbitrary and capricious manner is a legal one which the district court can resolve on \nthe agency record, regardless of whether it is presented in the context of a motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings or in a motion for summary judgment). \nEven outside the context of the APA, the Court may consider “matters of … judicial \nnotice.”  Hurd v. Dist. of Columbia, 864 F.3d 671, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citations omitted); see \nalso Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).  The Court may also \nconsider exhibits that are submitted with the complaint, see Hurd, 864 F.3d at 678, as well as \n“documents upon which the plaintiff’s complaint necessarily relies even if the document is \nproduced not by the plaintiff in the complaint but by the defendant in a motion to dismiss,” such \nas  when  the  complaint  “quotes  from  and  discusses  a  document  extensively.”  Patterson  v. \nUnited States, 999 F. Supp. 2d 300, 306 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal citations and alterations omitted).  \nARGUMENT \nIn seeking to invalidate the Rescission Policy, Plaintiffs ask the Court to override the \nActing Secretary’s judgment about how to exercise her discretion in enforcing the Nation’s \nimmigration laws—a matter long regarded as the exclusive province of the Executive Branch.  The \nCourt need not consider this extraordinary request, however, because Plaintiffs lack standing to \nmake it.  They identify no injury to their own interests as organizations, name no members actually \nharmed by the policy, and have no mission with an apparent connection to this suit.  And even if \nPlaintiffs could establish standing, this case is not justiciable.  The exercise of enforcement \ndiscretion in the Rescission Policy is committed to agency discretion by law and is therefore \nunreviewable.  In fact, Congress has gone so far as to strip district courts of jurisdiction over “no \n 13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 27 of 58\n \ndeferred action” decisions such as the one here.  In any event, even if Plaintiffs could overcome \nthese hurdles, they fail to state a claim.  This case should be dismissed. \nI.  THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING \n  A.  Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing \n1.  Plaintiffs lack organizational standing. \nPlaintiffs  open  their  complaint  by  declaring  that  they  “bring  this  action  in  their \norganizational capacities.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 1.  Yet they make no attempt to identify any injury \nwhatsoever to their own interests as organizations.  Their allegations are patently insufficient to \nestablish standing. \nTo establish Article III standing, an organization suing on its own behalf must meet the \nfamiliar standing requirements that apply to individuals: (1) injury in fact; (2) causation; and \n(3) redressability.  See, e.g., Nat’l Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. United States, 68 F.3d 1428, 1433 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995).  As the parties invoking the Court’s jurisdiction, Plaintiffs bear the burden \n“clearly to allege facts demonstrating” each of these three elements.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. \n490, 518 (1975).  The necessary facts “must affirmatively appear in the record” and “cannot be \ninferred argumentatively from averments in the pleadings.”  FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 \nU.S. 215, 231 (1990).  The standing inquiry is “‘especially rigorous’” where, as here, “reaching \nthe merits of the dispute would force [a court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the \nother two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ complaint fails at the first step of the analysis.  Here, Plaintiffs were not the \nobject of any government policy.  Instead, a generous reading of the complaint reveals, at most, \ndissatisfaction with the alleged effects of a policy decision on “undocumented immigrants of \n 14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 28 of 58\n \ncolor.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 1; see also id. ¶¶ 3, 12.  But the federal courts do not sit to air arguments \n“at the behest of organizations or individuals who seek to do no more than vindicate their own \nvalue preferences,” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 740 (1972), or to resolve “generalized \ngrievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,” Elk Grove Unified Sch. \nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004) (citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark \nInt’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, 134 S. Ct. 1377 (2014).  Thus, a “mere ‘interest in a \nproblem,’ no matter how longstanding the interest and no matter how qualified the organization is \nin evaluating the problem,” is insufficient to create standing.  Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 739.  \nAccordingly, an “organization’s abstract concern with a subject that could be affected by an \nadjudication does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art[icle] III.”  Spann v. \nColonial Vill., Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., \n426 U.S. 26, 40 (1976)). \nNor can Plaintiffs show an injury to their own activities.  To satisfy Article III under this \ntheory of standing, an organization must demonstrate a “concrete and demonstrable injury to the \norganization’s  activities—with  [a]  consequent  drain  on  the  organization’s  resources—\nconstitut[ing] ... more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.”  Nat’l \nTaxpayers Union, 68 F.3d at 1433 (alterations in original) (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. \nColeman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982)).  “Such a showing requires ‘more than allegations of damage \nto an interest in “seeing” the law obeyed or a social goal furthered.’”  Id. (quoting Am. Legal \nFound. v. FCC, 808 F.2d 84, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).  Rather, “the organization must allege that \ndiscrete programmatic concerns are being directly and adversely affected” by the challenged \naction.  Id. (citation and alteration omitted).  Here, Plaintiffs do not even try to meet this test.  See \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 11–16.  They identify no history of immigration advocacy.  They point to no \n 15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 29 of 58\n \ninterference with any immigration-related programming.  And they allege no new expenditure of \nfunds—not so much as a dime.  Plaintiffs thus fall well short of their burden to establish a \ncognizable injury to their own interests.  Their claim of organizational standing should be rejected \nout of hand. \n2.  Plaintiffs lack representational standing. \nWhile Plaintiffs do not expressly bring suit in their representational capacities, see id. ¶ 1, \none of them—the NAACP—does allege in passing that it sues “on behalf of [their] members who \nare currently enrolled in, and who applied to enroll in, the DACA program,” id. ¶ 12.  But it fails \nto identify any particular member allegedly harmed by the policy change, and that alone dooms \nany claim of representational standing. \nTo  establish  “representational”  (or  “associational”)  standing  to  sue  on  behalf  of  its \nmembers, an association must show that (1) at least one of its members has standing to sue in his \nown right; (2) the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose; and \n(3) neither litigation over the claim asserted nor the relief sought requires the participation of an \nindividual member.  Interstate Nat. Gas Ass’n of Am. v. FERC, 494 F.3d 1092, 1095 (D.C. Cir. \n2007).  To satisfy the first of these prongs, an association must at the very least name a specific \nmember with standing for each claim it asserts.  See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, \n498 (2009) (association must “name the individuals who were harmed”); Am. Chemistry Council \nv. Dep’t of Transp., 468 F.3d 810, 820 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“identity” of injured member must be \n“firmly established”).  Because the NAACP makes no effort to name any member allegedly \nharmed by the Rescission Policy, it lacks representational standing. \nEven if the NAACP could overcome these barriers, any claim of representational standing \nwould flunk the second prong of the test, as the organization makes no showing that the interests \n 16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 30 of 58\n \nit seeks to protect are “germane to its purpose.”  Interstate Nat. Gas, 494 F.3d at 1095; see Humane \nSoc’y of U.S. v. Hodel, 840 F.2d 45, 56–57 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (the germaneness requirement \nmandates “that an organization’s litigation goals be pertinent to its special expertise and the \ngrounds that bring its membership together,” and serves to “prevent[] litigious organizations from \nforcing the federal courts to resolve numerous issues as to which the organizations themselves \nenjoy little expertise and about which few of their members demonstrably care”).  The NAACP \nalleges that, “[s]ince its founding in 1909, [its] mission ... has been to ensure the political, \neducational, social, and economic equality of all persons,” and that it has filed “numerous amicus \nbriefs ... in cases that significantly impact people of color.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 11.  Conspicuously \nabsent from that description of its mission and activities is any mention of immigration—the focus \nof this lawsuit.  Indeed, immigration is not listed on the NAACP’s website as one of the “issues” \nit pursues, and a search of its website for the term “DACA” returns just a handful of hits, all related \nto the filing of this case.  See http://www.naacp.org (last visited Nov. 8, 2017).  Thus, the NAACP \nfails to show that the interests at stake in this case are germane to its mission—an independently \nsufficient reason to reject any claim of representational standing.2 \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack Prudential Standing \n                                                 \n2 To the extent the allegations of the other two Plaintiffs—the American Federation of Teachers \n(“AFT”) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (“UFCW”)—could \nbe read to attempt to invoke representational standing, cf. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13–16, any such claim \nwould fail for the same reasons.  Like the NAACP, neither AFT nor UFCW names any member \nallegedly harmed by the Rescission Policy.  And neither makes any showing that the interests it \nseeks to protect are germane to its purpose.  AFT is a teachers’ union, and it offers only the general \nallegation  that  it  has  a  history  of  “advocating  for  the  civil  rights  of  its  members  and  the \ncommunities they serve.”  Id. ¶ 13.  UFCW is a union representing mostly “retail, meatpacking \nand poultry, food processing, and manufacturing” employees, and it offers the similarly general \nallegation that it “fights to advance and safeguard full employment, economic security, and social \nwelfare of its members.”  Id. ¶ 15.  While UFCW asserts that “immigrants from around the world” \nare among the workers it represents, id. ¶ 16, it alleges no particular expertise in immigration law \nor any connection between immigration law and its organizational mission. \n 17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 31 of 58\n \nEven if Plaintiffs could establish Article III standing, they would lack prudential standing \nbecause they fall outside the zone of interests protected by the INA.  The APA does not “allow \nsuit by every person suffering [an] injury in fact.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 395 \n(1987).  Rather, it provides a cause of action only to a plaintiff “adversely affected or aggrieved \nby agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  To be “aggrieved” in \nthis sense, “the interest sought to be protected by the complainant [must] be arguably within the \nzone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.”  Clarke, 479 U.S. at \n396  (brackets  and  citation  omitted).    Here,  no  provision  of  the  INA  protects  the  Plaintiff \norganizations from bearing any incidental effects of a denial of deferred action.  Cf. Fed’n for Am. \nImmigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno, 93 F.3d 897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (dismissing under zone-of-\ninterests a suit challenging parole of aliens into this country, where plaintiffs relied on incidental \neffects of that policy on workers). \nII.  THIS CASE IS NOT JUSTICIABLE \nA.  The  Rescission  Policy  Is  Not  Justiciable  Because  this  Immigration \nEnforcement Policy Is a Matter Committed to Agency Discretion by Law \n1.  The APA bars judicial review of certain categories of decisions that “courts traditionally \nhave regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)).  These decisions are typically unreviewable because there exists \n“no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in these areas.  \nChaney, 470 U.S. at 830; see Davis v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 517 F. Supp. 2d 460, 461 (D.D.C. \n2007) (“The APA, however, also provides an exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity ... \nwhen ... agency action is committed to agency discretion.”), aff’d in part and remanded, 334 F. \nApp’x 332 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  This bar applies even when “the agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason \nfor otherwise unreviewable action.”  ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs (BLE), 482 U.S. 270, 283 \n 18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 32 of 58\n \n(1987). \nAmong the decisions committed to executive discretion are “an agency’s exercise of \nenforcement power.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833.  Such judgments involve “a complicated balancing \nof … factors which are peculiarly within [an agency’s] expertise,” including “whether agency \nresources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it \nacts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall priorities, \nand, indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at all.”  Id. at 831.  \nAs there is “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in \nweighing these factors, an agency’s exercise of enforcement powers is “presumed immune from \njudicial review under § 701(a)(2).”  Id. at 830, 832. \nFor instance, an “agency [] decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or \ncriminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id. at 831.  \nAfter all, “[a]n agency generally cannot act against each technical violation of the statute it is \ncharged with enforcing,” and it is “far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many \nvariables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.”  Id. at 831–32.  Thus, for example, the \nSupreme Court in Chaney held that the FDA’s general policy of refusing to exercise jurisdiction \nover the states’ use of approved drugs in lethal injections was committed to the agency’s discretion \nunder § 701(a)(2).  See 470 U.S. at 824–25, 837–38.     \nAn  agency’s  decision  to  enforce  the  law  against  a  particular  individual  is  likewise \npresumptively unreviewable.  Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” presumptively \n“rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 \n(1996) (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil enforcement action is generally not \nopen to judicial scrutiny.  Considerations such as “whether agency resources are best spent on this \n 19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 33 of 58\n \nviolation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, [and] whether the particular \nenforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies” are equally present in \nenforcement decisions as in nonenforcement decisions, Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831, and judicial \nintrusion into the deliberative process is equally improper, see Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. \nv. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971) (“there must be a strong showing of bad faith or improper \nbehavior before” courts can engage in an “inquiry into the mental processes of administrative \ndecisionmakers”), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977). \nThis presumption of nonreviewability applies with particular force when it comes to \nimmigration.  On top of the  general concerns  implicated in any  enforcement decision, the \nenforcement of immigration laws “embraces immediate human concerns,” and the “dynamic \nnature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that [immigration] \nenforcement policies are consistent with this Nation’s foreign policy.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396–\n97.  Given these realities, the “broad discretion exercised by immigration officials” has become a \n“principal feature of the removal system.”  Id. at 396.  One form of that broad discretion is deferred \naction, a “discretionary and reversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek \nhis removal for a specific period of time.  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 17; see supra at 5–6.  Like other \nagency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing of policy \nconsiderations that cannot serve as a “meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \nexercise of discretion.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 830.  Such determinations are thus presumptively \nunreviewable.  See Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 16.    \nThe converse is equally true: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency \ndiscretion.  See AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary \ndeterminations”).  Because “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in \n 20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 34 of 58\n \nthis country” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which judges \nmay patrol its exercise.”  Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) (INS’s decision \nnot to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to a group of aliens non-\njusticiable).  To be sure, a decision “not to grant deferred action status to a particular alien is not \nprecisely a ‘decision not to take enforcement action,’” but that does not obscure the fact that “many \nof the same factors” underlying the latter determinations usually play a role in the former.  Mada-\nLuna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1011 n.4 (9th Cir. 1987) (“denials of deferred action status \napplications are not subject to judicial review” under § 701(a)(2)).   \n2.  As an exercise of enforcement discretion, the Rescission Policy is a classic example of \na discretionary determination that is entrusted to the agency alone.  Indeed, any attempt to judge \nthe Policy would quickly entangle this Court in the sort of complex and discretionary balancing \nthat has been entrusted by Congress to the Executive Branch.  For example, the judiciary is \ninstitutionally  ill-equipped  to  assess  whether  the  Acting  Secretary’s  decision  to  change \n“immigration policies and priorities” by rescinding DACA, Rescission Policy at 4 (AR 255), was \nan appropriate use of “the Department’s limited resources,” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 16.  Nor is this \nCourt well suited to second-guess the Acting Secretary’s balancing of the costs and benefits of \nkeeping the policy in place, on one hand, with the risk of “potentially imminent litigation” that \ncould throw DACA into immediate turmoil, on the other.  Rescission Policy at 3 (AR 254) (citation \nomitted). \nTo be sure, the Acting Secretary also gave substantive legal reasons for her decision, id. at \n2–4 (AR 253–55), but that does not render it justiciable.  That is because the Supreme Court has \nrejected the proposition that if an “agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable \naction, the action becomes reviewable.”  BLE, 482 U.S. at 283.  For example, “a common reason \n 21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 35 of 58\n \nfor failure to prosecute an alleged criminal violation is the prosecutor’s belief (sometimes publicly \nstated) that the law will not sustain a conviction,” which “is surely an eminently ‘reviewable’ \nproposition, in the sense that courts are well qualified to consider the point.”  Id.  But that does not \nchange the fact that “it is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject of judicial \nreview.”  Id.  Likewise, the Acting Secretary’s discussion of the question of DACA’s legality does \nnot transform her generally unreviewable exercise of enforcement discretion into a matter fit for \njudicial scrutiny. \nIndeed, reviewing the Rescission Policy would be particularly inappropriate given the wide \ndiscretion the Secretary enjoys in the enforcement of the immigration laws.  In AADC, the Supreme \nCourt held that “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional right to assert selective \nenforcement as a defense against his deportation,” 525 U.S. at 488, subject to the “possib[le]” \nexception “of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous that the \nforegoing considerations can be overcome,” id. at 491.  The reason for this highly restrictive rule \nis that the concerns raised by challenges to the Executive’s enforcement discretion “are greatly \nmagnified in the deportation context.”  Id. at 490.  An alien subject to removal is, by definition, in \ncontinuing violation of the INA, and judicial interference with the Executive’s enforcement \ntherefore  would  compel  the  Executive  to  disregard  such  ongoing  violations.    The  “delay” \nassociated with challenges to discretionary decisions not to forgo enforcement is more likely than \nin the criminal arena, as “[p]ostponing justifiable deportation (in the hope that the alien’s status \nwill change … or simply with the object of extending the alien’s unlawful stay) is often the \nprincipal object of resistance to a deportation proceeding,” and “the consequence is to permit and \nprolong a continuing violation” of the immigration laws.  Id. at 490.  For another, reviewing \nimmigration  decisions  may  involve  “not  merely  the  disclosure  of  normal  domestic  law \n 22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 36 of 58\n \nenforcement priorities and techniques, but often the disclosure of foreign-policy objectives” or \nother sensitive matters as well.  Id. at 490–91.  Finally, the idea that “an ongoing violation of \nUnited States law ... must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected is not \npowerfully appealing.”  Id. at 491 (emphasis omitted). \nB.  The INA Deprives District Courts of Jurisdiction over Challenges to Denials \nof Deferred Action \n  \nNot only is the denial of deferred action committed to agency discretion under the APA, \nbut the INA itself deprives federal district courts of jurisdiction over challenges to such denials \naltogether.    As  the  Supreme  Court  explained  in  AADC,  the  Executive’s  “exercise  of  [its] \ndiscretion” in granting deferred action in some circumstances had “opened the door to litigation ... \nwhere” the Executive had “chose[n] not to exercise it.”  525 U.S. at 484.  Specifically, some courts \nhad entertained challenges to “the refusal to exercise such discretion” on various bases such as \n“selective prosecution,” the use of “arbitrary or unconstitutional criteria, or on other grounds \nconstituting abuse of discretion.”  Id. at 485 (citation omitted).  To address what the Supreme Court \nreferred  to  as  this  “particular  evil”—i.e.,  “attempts  to  impose  judicial  constraints  upon \nprosecutorial discretion”—Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  Id. at 485 & n.9.   \nSection 1252(g) commands that, outside of petitions for review from final removal orders \nand certain other limited channels for review, “no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause \nor claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the [Secretary of \nHomeland Security3] to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders \nagainst any alien under this [Act].”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  These were “the acts … that had prompted \nchallenges to the … exercise of prosecutorial discretion” in denying deferred action, and thus \n                                                 \n3 See 6 U.S.C. § 557; see also id. §§ 202, 251; Elgharib v. Napolitano, 600 F.3d 597, 607 (6th Cir. \n2010) (“[U]nder 6 U.S.C. § 557, ... the statutory reference to the ‘Attorney General’ in § 1252(g) \nnow means ‘Secretary of DHS.’”). \n 23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 37 of 58\n \n§ 1252(g) “seems clearly designed to give some measure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ \ndecisions and similar discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they \nat least will not be made the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the \nstreamlined process that Congress has designed”—namely, an individual removal proceeding.  \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9. \nDenials  of  deferred  action—including  under  DACA  itself—thus  fall  outside  the \njurisdiction of the federal courts.  See, e.g., Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. \n2016) (“[Section] 1252(g) … deprives all courts of jurisdiction to review a denial of DACA relief \nbecause that decision involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a deferred \naction.”); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) (“Review of refusal to grant deferred \naction is … excluded from the jurisdiction of the district court.”). \n  To be sure, Plaintiffs brought this challenge to the Rescission Policy before any removal \nproceedings took place, but that is beside the point.  The decision not to continue deferred action \nis an ingredient to the commencement of enforcement proceedings at some future date, and a \nperson cannot circumvent the bar in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) by singling out that single step for a \npreemptive challenge.  Indeed, if aliens (or entities suing on their behalf) could evade § 1252(g)’s \nbar simply by challenging the forthcoming expiration of deferred action before actual removal \nproceedings (if any) began, then jurisdiction would turn on a race to the courthouse.  Such a \nframework  would  create  the  perverse  incentive  for  DHS  to  begin  removal  proceedings \nimmediately rather than to allow, as it did here, for rolling expirations of deferred action status \nover a two-and-a-half year period.  There is no indication that Congress sought to enact such a \nnonsensical regime.  Instead, § 1252(g) precludes review of either “the decision or action” by the \nActing Secretary “to commence proceedings,” and thereby sweeps in the Rescission Policy \n 24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 38 of 58\n \n(emphasis added). \nMoreover, at least one court has applied § 1252(g) to actions that are “not … on the list of \nprecluded items”—i.e., “decisions to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal \norders”—in order to effectuate the object of this jurisdictional bar.  Botezatu, 195 F.3d at 313–14.  \nIn Botezatu, the Seventh Circuit rejected an alien’s argument that a court could review the \nExecutive’s “refusal to … grant him humanitarian parole or deferred action” simply because that \ndenial occurred in “post-deportation procedures.”  Id. at 313–14.  As the Seventh Circuit explained, \nbecause  AADC  broadly  held  that  “‘no  deferred  action’  decisions  and  similar  discretionary \ndeterminations’ [were] governed by § 1252(g),” that jurisdictional bar should apply regardless of \nwhen such determinations occurred.  Id. at 314 (quoting AADC, 525 U.S. at 485).  Thus, just as an \nalien (or entity suing on his behalf) cannot circumvent § 1252(g) by bringing a challenge to a \ndenial of deferred action on the back-end, Plaintiffs’ broad front-end assault on the Rescission \nPolicy is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.  At the very least, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) reinforces the \nconclusion that enforcement discretion under the INA is at the core of unreviewable matters \ncommitted to agency discretion by law under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). \nC.  The Government’s Justiciability Objections Are Not Inconsistent with the \nActing Secretary’s Reliance on the Fifth Circuit’s Decision \n  \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit in Texas included holdings that a challenge to the DAPA Memo \nwas reviewable, 809 F.3d at 165–70, neither that decision nor Acting Secretary Duke’s reliance \non  it  forecloses  the  government  from  arguing  here  that  the  DACA  Rescission  Policy  is \nunreviewable.  First, neither the Acting Secretary’s memo nor the Attorney General’s letter \nexpressly relied upon or gave any indication that they agreed with the Fifth Circuit’s justiciability \nrulings, and it was far from arbitrary and capricious for the Acting Secretary to weigh litigation \nrisk based on judicial decisions without regard to whether those courts had been correct to assert \n 25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 39 of 58\n \njurisdiction in the first place.  Second, officers of the Executive Branch have an independent duty \nto consider the legality of their policies regardless of whether they are judicially reviewable; all \nswear an oath to uphold the United States Constitution.  See Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, \n499 (1867) (Take Care Clause imposes a generally nonjusticiable duty on the Executive Branch).  \nFinally, even if courts could have reviewed the adoption of DACA as “an abdication of [DHS’s] \nstatutory responsibilities,” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4, that would not make the Rescission Policy, \na classic exercise of agency enforcement discretion, open to challenge.  After all, the Fifth Circuit \nitself emphasized that “DAPA is much more than a nonenforcement policy, which presumptively \nwould be committed to agency discretion,” Texas, 809 F.3d at 178 n.156, and pointed out that a \n“denial of voluntary departure and work authorization” by DHS would have been nonjusticiable, \nid. at 168.  Denials of deferred action under a return to a more traditional enforcement policy \nshould be treated no differently.  \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM \n  Even if Plaintiffs could establish standing and justiciability, the Court should dismiss this \ncase in its entirety for failure to state a claim.4 \nA.  Plaintiffs Fail to State an APA Claim \n \n1.  The Acting Secretary rationally explained her decision to wind down \nDACA,  particularly  given  the  imminent  risk  of  a  nationwide \ninjunction. \n \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  the  Rescission  Policy  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  it \nconstitutes a change in agency policy without an adequate explanation.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 69–74 \n(Count III).  That argument misapprehends the nature of the inquiry under the APA.  It is black-\n                                                 \n4 In the alternative, however, the Court may if it wishes convert this motion to one for \nsummary judgment. See Bates, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 17, 19.  \n 26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 40 of 58\n \nletter law that agencies are free to change course on policy matters so long as they provide a \nrational explanation.  Here, the Acting Secretary’s explanation of her decision to rescind DACA \nreadily meets this deferential standard, particularly in view of the imminent risk of a nationwide \ninjunction, which could have prompted an immediate—and chaotic—end to the policy. \n1.  Under the APA, an agency’s decision must be upheld unless arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see also id. \n§ 706(2)(B).  The agency’s decision is presumed valid under this standard, and the Court asks only \nwhether it “was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear \nerror of judgment.”  Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416.  A decision may be held to be arbitrary and \ncapricious only when the agency “has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to \nconsider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, [or] offered an explanation \nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,” or the decision “is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The Court may not “substitute \nits judgment for that of the agency.”  Id.  And when an agency changes policies, it “need not \ndemonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons \nfor the old one.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Rather, “it \nsuffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and \nthat the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.”  \nId. \n  In assessing whether a decision was arbitrary and capricious, “[t]he task of the reviewing \ncourt is to apply the appropriate APA standard of review to the agency decision based on the record \nthe agency presents to the reviewing court.”  Fla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, \n 27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 41 of 58\n \n743–44 (1985) (citation omitted).  If the agency’s action “is not sustainable on the administrative \nrecord made,” then the administrative “decision must be vacated and the matter remanded to [the \nagency] for further consideration.”  Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973).  This Court should \ntherefore decide whether the Acting Secretary’s decision to wind down DACA was arbitrary and \ncapricious on the administrative record she has produced.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestion, see \nPls.’ Mot. for Case Mgmt. Order, ECF No. 9, the Court cannot consider additional materials \nconcerning her deliberative process.  It is “not the function of the court to probe the mental \nprocesses” of the agency.  Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18 (1938).  “Just as a judge cannot \nbe subjected to such a scrutiny ... so the integrity of the administrative process must be equally \nrespected.” United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 (1941) (citation omitted).  Deliberative \nmaterials are therefore not merely protected from disclosure—they do not form part of the \nadministrative record at all.  See San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. N.R.C., 789 F.2d 26, \n45 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc).  Thus, while the government submits that the Acting Secretary’s \ndecision was plainly not arbitrary and capricious under the record already before this Court, if this \nCourt were to disagree, it should do no more than simply grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek by \nsetting aside the Rescission Policy and remanding to her. \n2.   The Rescission Policy amply meets the “minimal standards of rationality” required by \nthe APA.  Troy Corp. v. Browner, 120 F.3d 277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs \ndo not deny that “the new policy is permissible under the [INA].”  Fox, 556 U.S. at 515.  And there \nare eminently “good reasons for it,” id., particularly in view of the litigation risk posed by the \nproceedings in Texas.  In the Rescission Policy, the Acting Secretary explained that, “[t]aking into \nconsideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the \nSeptember 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA \n 28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 42 of 58\n \nprogram should be terminated.”  Rescission Policy at 4 (AR 255).  Specifically, after summarizing \nthe Texas litigation and the nationwide injunction against DAPA (and its expansion of DACA), \nshe quoted the Attorney General’s conclusion in his letter that because DACA “has the same legal \nand constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially \nimminent litigation would yield similar results.”  Id. at 3 (AR 254) (citation omitted).  The Acting \nSecretary thus concluded that maintaining the DACA Policy would, in all likelihood, result in \nanother  nationwide  injunction  plunging  the  policy,  and  its  nearly  800,000  recipients,  into \nuncertainty.   \nThe Acting Secretary was then “faced with two options:  wind the program down in an \norderly fashion that protects beneficiaries in the near-term while working with Congress to pass \nlegislation;  or  allow  the  judiciary  to  potentially  shut  the  program  down  completely  and \nimmediately.”  Press Release, DHS, Statement from Acting Secretary Duke on the Rescission of \nDACA (Sept. 5, 2017), https://go.usa.gov/xncuM.  She reasonably opted for an orderly rescission, \nwhich she considered “the least disruptive option.”  Id. \nThere is nothing at all irrational about this choice or that explanation.  Cf. Chevron U.S.A. \nInc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 84 (2002) (“regulation reasonable” based on concerns about \nsubjecting parties to “possible … liability”).  Indeed, it is entirely sensible, given the turmoil that \nan abrupt, court-ordered shutdown would likely have provoked.  The Acting Secretary balanced \nthe litigation risk of keeping DACA in place with “the administrative complexities associated with \nending the program,” and opted for a solution that would “wind it down in an efficient and orderly \nfashion” accounting for the interests of DACA recipients.  Rescission Policy at 3 (AR 254).  She \nexplained her reasonable decision to rescind DACA, and the APA requires no more.  See Bowman \nTransp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974) (citation omitted) (APA \n 29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 43 of 58\n \nsatisfied where agency’s explanation is clear enough that its “path may reasonably be discerned”).  \nAnd no matter whether her (or the Attorney General’s) judgment about the likely result of the \nTexas litigation would have turned out to be correct, it was surely not an irrational or arbitrary and \ncapricious conclusion in light of the fact that at least the Fifth Circuit and four justices of the \nSupreme Court had already held that a materially indistinguishable policy was unlawful. \n3.  Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Rescission Policy “fails to be supported by, or even \naccompanied by, a rationale that justifies the withdrawal of a longstanding program lawfully \ninstituted,” Am. Compl. ¶ 71, entirely ignores the Acting Secretary’s assessment of litigation risk, \nwhich is reason enough to reject their arbitrariness claim.  To the extent Plaintiffs suggest that \nthe Acting Secretary’s consideration of the Attorney General’s views about DACA’s legality \nsomehow  rendered  her  decision  arbitrary  and  capricious,  the  argument  suffers  from  three \nindependent flaws. \nFirst, the Acting Secretary did not rely on the Attorney General’s September 4 letter solely \nfor its assessment of DACA’s legality.  Instead, as discussed above, she concluded that DACA \n“should” be wound down after considering, among other things, his litigation-risk determination \nthat it was “likely” that a legal challenge to DACA “would yield similar results” as the DAPA \nlitigation under Fifth Circuit precedent.  Rescission Policy at 3-4 (AR 254-55).  That independent \nconclusion, based on a reasonable predictive judgment about litigation risk, is a sufficient basis for \nupholding the Acting Secretary’s decision to rescind DACA.  See Bowman, 419 U.S. at 286.    \nSecond, to the extent the Acting Secretary did rely on the proposition that DACA was \nunlawful, this Court need not agree with that determination to uphold her decision.  If an agency’s \nconstitutional analysis and policy judgment overlap, courts should presume an independent policy \njudgment  to  avoid  constitutional  questions,  even  if  the  two  determinations  are  arguably \n 30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 44 of 58\n \n“intertwined.”  See Syracuse Peace Council v. FCC, 867 F.2d 654, 657–59 (D.C. Cir. 1989) \n(citation omitted) (if “even in the absence of constitutional problems the [agency] would have \nreached the same outcome,” “we must end our inquiry without reaching that issue”).  Here, the \nAttorney General regarded DACA as unconstitutional in part because it was an “open-ended” \npolicy  that  closely  tracked  “proposed  legislation”  that  Congress  had  repeatedly  rejected.  \nRescission Policy at 3 (AR 254) (citation omitted).  But those same concerns equally support a \npolicy judgment by the Acting Secretary that “deferred action” should “be applied only on an \nindividualized case-by-case basis” rather than used as a tool “to confer certain benefits to illegal \naliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by law.”  Id. at 2 (AR 253).  This Court \nshould sustain her decision based on a reasonable policy judgment that immigration decisions of \nthis magnitude should be left to Congress. \nThird, although this Court need not decide the issue to resolve this case in favor of the \ngovernment on the basis that the agency decision was at least rational, the Attorney General’s view \nthat DACA was unlawful is strongly supported by the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Texas that was \naffirmed by the Supreme Court.  The Fifth Circuit held not only that DAPA—including its \nproposed expansion of DACA—was likely unlawful, but also that DACA bore many “important \nsimilarities” to it.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 174 & n.139 (noting that “the DAPA Memo’s plain language \n… equates the DACA and DAPA procedure[s],” making DACA an “apt comparator”).  Indeed, \ngiven that DAPA was enjoined before its implementation, the Fifth Circuit’s decision was \n“informed by analysis of the implementation of DACA” itself.  Id. at 172.  On that score, while, \n“[l]ike the DAPA Memo, the DACA Memo instructed agencies to review applications on a case-\nby-case basis,” and thus “facially purport[ed] to confer discretion,” id. at 171–72, the court found \nthat discretion to be illusory in practice:  Because relatively few DACA requests were denied, the \n 31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 45 of 58\n \nFifth Circuit believed “there was evidence from DACA’s implementation that [this] discretionary \nlanguage was pretextual,” id. at 172–73.  Based on these findings by the Fifth Circuit, it would \nfollow that DACA, like DAPA, did not “genuinely leave the agency and its employees free to \nexercise discretion” on a case-by-case basis, id. at 176—which supports the Attorney General’s \nview that DACA was unlawful.  And it seems likely that at least four justices of the Supreme Court \nagree. \nRegardless of whether the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) was correct when it previously \n“orally advised” that its “preliminary view” was that the proposed version of DACA would be \nlawful,  the  reasoning  in  that  opinion  further  confirms  the  invalidity  of  DACA  as  actually \nimplemented in practice as found by the Fifth Circuit.  OLC Op. 18 n.8.  The “preliminary” \nconclusion was conditioned on the proviso that “it was critical that … the DACA program require \nimmigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis.”  Id.  \nYet the Fifth Circuit found that DHS officials did not “genuinely” retain such discretion in practice.  \nTexas, 809 F.3d at 176.  Indeed, because deferred action continues to exist on an individualized \nbasis, the only change made by the Acting Secretary is the elimination of the factors that, according \nto the Fifth Circuit, led to the policy being applied without sufficient case-by case discretion.  See \nid. at 172–73 (noting testimony that, for DACA, requests were “simply rubberstamped if the \napplicants meet the necessary criteria” (footnote and citation omitted)).  Further, the original \nDACA program largely shares the relevant defects of the proposed expansion of deferred action \nthat OLC rejected, rather than the aspects of the new program that it approved. \n4.  Plaintiffs also allege that the Rescission Policy is arbitrary and capricious because the \nActing  Secretary  failed  to  sufficiently  consider  the  “serious  reliance  interests  by  [DACA] \nparticipants.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 71.  But as set forth in Part II.A, supra, the Rescission Memo is \n 32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 46 of 58\n \nmerely  a  statement  of  policy  that—like  the  original  DACA  policy—does  not  create  any \nenforceable rights and is subject to change at any time.  And insofar as Plaintiffs suggest that the \nActing Secretary failed to consider the reliance interests of DACA recipients more generally, that \nassertion ignores her calculus based on the looming risk of a nationwide injunction ending the \nDACA program altogether.  Given her view that she faced an imminent, court-ordered end to \nDACA, the Acting Secretary opted for an orderly wind-down process that would protect the \nreliance interests of DACA recipients far more than would an immediate injunction terminating \nthe program.  See supra Part III.A.  Finally, to the extent that she rationally concluded DACA was \nillegal, there would be no legitimate reliance interests at all. \nIn all events, the foregoing analysis confirms that the Acting Secretary’s decision was at a \nminimum reasonable and that Plaintiffs’ APA challenge can be resolved at this stage based on the \nrecord  now  before  the  Court.    Indeed,  whatever  this  Court  decides,  there  is  no  basis  for \nsupplementing the record or discovery to assess the Acting Secretary’s explanation. \n 33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 47 of 58\n \n2.  The Rescission Policy is exempt from notice and comment. \nPlaintiffs likewise miss the mark in arguing that the Rescission Policy must be set aside \nbecause it is a substantive rule issued without notice and comment.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 72–73; \nsee also 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c).  If winding down the DACA policy is a “substantive rule,” then a \nfortiori so was enacting the policy in the first place.  Critically, though, the DACA Memo itself \nalso was not adopted through notice and comment.  So even on Plaintiffs’ own theory, it would be \nvoid ab initio—leaving Plaintiffs without a remedy.  That is reason enough to dismiss this claim.  \nSee Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (plaintiff must show “injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision’” \nto establish standing (citation omitted)).5  \nIn any event, Plaintiffs’ claim is erroneous.  DHS and INS have adopted over 20 deferred \naction or similar policies over the past 50 years—rarely through notice and comment.  That is \nbecause such policies, like the Rescission Policy, are not substantive rules at all.  Rather, they are \nclassic examples of “general statements of policy” that are exempt from the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment requirements.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A). \nA “substantive rule establishes a standard of conduct which has the force of law.”  Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Fed. Power Comm’n, 506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  Thus, an “agency \n                                                 \n5 To be sure, the D.C. Circuit has rejected the “argument that notice and comment requirements \ndo not apply to ‘defectively promulgated regulations’” as “untenable because it would permit an \nagency to circumvent the requirements of § 553 merely by confessing that the regulations were \ndefective in some respect and asserting that modification or repeal without notice and comment \nwas necessary to correct the situation.”  Consumer Energy Council of Am. v. FERC, 673 F.2d 425, \n447 n.79 (D.C. Cir. 1982) aff’d sub nom, Process Gas Consumers Grp. V. Consumer Energy \nCouncil of Am., 463 U.S. 1216 (1983).  That holding, however, concerned the rescission of a rule \npromulgated after notice and comment that was allegedly defective on other grounds, not a rule \nthat was defective precisely because it had failed to go through notice and comment in the first \nplace.  See id. at 445–46.  When an agency has already “circumvent[ed] the requirements of § 553,” \nid. at 447 n.79, there is no reason why it must go through those procedures to cure the underlying \ndefect.      \n 34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 48 of 58\n \naction that purports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated parties—\nand that would be the basis for an enforcement action for violations of those obligations or \nrequirements—is a legislative rule.”  Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). \nA statement of policy, by contrast, “advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner in \nwhich the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. \n281, 302 n.31 (1979) (quoting Attorney General’s Manual on the APA 30 n.3 (1947)).  It “explains \nhow the agency will enforce a statute or regulation—in other words, how it will exercise its broad \nenforcement discretion or permitting discretion under some extant statute or rule.”  McCarthy, 758 \nF.3d at 252.  It serves to “appris[e] the regulated community of the agency’s intentions” and \n“inform[] the exercise of discretion by agents and officers in the field.”  Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. \nYoung, 818 F.2d 943, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  And “a general statement of policy, like a press \nrelease,” often “announces the course which the agency intends to follow in future adjudications.”  \nPac. Gas & Elec., 506 F.2d at 38.  Accordingly, policy statements “are binding on neither the \npublic nor the agency,” and the agency “retains the discretion and the authority to change its \nposition … in any specific case.”  Syncor Int’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \n(citations omitted). \nAs these principles make clear, the Rescission Policy is a quintessential policy statement—\na point that its text reinforces again and again.  It was issued as an “exercise of [the Secretary’s] \nauthority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities.”  Rescission Policy at 4 (AR \n255).  It explains how the agency intends to exercise its enforcement authority on a prospective \nbasis, a matter that is “generally committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. \nat 831 (citations omitted).  It does not immediately deprive any DACA recipients of their current \n 35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 49 of 58\n \ndeferred action status, but describes how pending and future deferred action requests will be \n“adjudicate[d]—on an individual, case-by-case basis.”  Rescission Policy at 4 (AR 255).  It does \nnot categorically forbid the agency from continuing to defer enforcement action against DACA \nrecipients  in  the  future,  but  instead  acknowledges  the  background  principle,  recognized  by \nCongress and the courts, that deferred action is “an act of prosecutorial discretion” that may be \nexercised “on an individualized case-by-case basis,” id. at 2 (AR 253), and that places “no \nlimitations” on the agency’s exercise of such “otherwise lawful enforcement … prerogatives,” id. \nat 5 (AR 256).  And it explains that it “does not … create any right or benefit, substantive or \nprocedural, enforceable at law by any party.”  Id.  Thus, in the wake of the Rescission Policy, \ndeferred action “remains discretionary and reversible,” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 17—as with the 20-\nodd deferred action or similar policies that DHS and INS have adopted over the past half-century, \ngenerally without going through the full notice-and-comment process.6 \nThat is as it should be.  An agency’s enforcement priorities will inevitably shift over time, \nwhether due to changing circumstances or resource constraints.  See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831.  \nIndeed, the DACA policy was originally adopted in part to set enforcement priorities in view of \nthe agency’s limited resources.  See Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 16; DACA Memo at 1 (AR 1); DAPA \nMemo at 1 (AR 37).  Under Plaintiffs’ theory, however, even if Congress were to vastly increase \nappropriations for immigration enforcement, the agency’s hands would be tied:  it would not be \nfree to adjust its enforcement priorities without engaging in “cumbersome and time-consuming \n                                                 \n6 The Fifth Circuit’s ruling that the adoption of the DAPA Memo required notice and comment \ndoes not imply that the rescission of DACA does as well.  Unlike the DAPA or DACA Memos, \nthe Rescission Policy announced a return to an enforcement policy of using deferred action on an \nindividualized basis, which cannot be cast as a substantive rule.  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself \nstressed that “DAPA is much more than a nonenforcement policy,” and that “a traditional \nnonenforcement policy would not necessarily be subject to notice and comment.”  Texas, 809 F.3d \nat 178 n.156.  In any event, if this Court agrees with the Fifth Circuit, then DACA was void ab \ninitio and Plaintiffs lack a remedy.      \n 36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 50 of 58\n \nrulemaking proceedings.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 851 \nF.2d 1424, 1430 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  The Court should not endorse such an intrusion into matters \nthat have “long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. \nat 832. \nB.  Plaintiffs Fail to State a Due Process Claim \nPlaintiffs claim that the Rescission Policy violates due process by “reneging on promises” \nallegedly made to DACA recipients. Am. Compl. ¶ 66.  While Plaintiffs’ theory is a bit unclear, \ntheir allegations are clearly mistaken, and they identify no actual deprivation of liberty or process.  \nIn any event, this claim fails for the simple reason that DACA recipients have no protected liberty \nor property interest in deferred action entitling them to due process protections.  Regardless, broad-\nbased changes in agency policy like the Rescission Policy do not require individualized process. \n1.  Plaintiffs identify no actual deprivation of liberty or property. \n \nPlaintiffs’ key due process allegations are demonstrably false:  They are flatly contradicted \nby documents incorporated by reference into the complaint, as well as by other publicly available, \njudicially noticeable documents.  Moreover, Plaintiffs identify no member who has actually been \nharmed by any of these supposedly “broken promises.”   \nFor example, Plaintiffs assert—without citation—that DHS promised “not to terminate \n[recipients] from the DACA program without justification and notice.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 61; see also \nid. ¶ 66.  In fact, the DACA FAQs state that “DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and \ndeferred action may be terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at \nDHS’s discretion.”  DHS DACA FAQ No. 27 (emphasis added).  Regardless, the Rescission \nPolicy does not “terminate” anyone’s DACA status—on the contrary, it provides that DHS \ngenerally “will not terminate the grants of previously issued deferred action ... for the remaining \n 37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 51 of 58\n \nduration of their validity periods” as part of the rescission.  Rescission Policy at 4 (AR 255) \n(emphasis added).  Notably, Plaintiffs point to no member whose DACA status was allegedly \nterminated by the Rescission Policy. \nPlaintiffs  likewise  claim—again  without  citation—that  DHS  promised  “to  provide \nemployment authorization to those eligible.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 61.  But Congress vested the Acting \nSecretary with discretion to determine whether to grant work authorization to aliens accorded \ndeferred action.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (defining “unauthorized alien” as, inter alia, an “alien \n[who] is not ... authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the [Acting Secretary]”).  And \nunder DHS regulations, work authorization is not an independent guarantee, but a consequence \nthat may flow from a grant of deferred action—one that ends when deferred action ends, which \nmay occur at any time.  See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (providing for work authorization for “[a]n \nalien  who  has  been  granted  deferred  action,  an  act  of  administrative  convenience  to  the \ngovernment”).  These statutes and regulations are “completely permissive” and provide “no \nmeaningful standards against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Perales, 903 \nF.2d at 1047, 1049 (citation omitted) (decisions to deny work authorization to a particular class of \naliens are committed to agency discretion by law).  Regardless, the Rescission Policy does not \nrescind anyone’s work authorization—indeed, it states that DHS generally “will not ... revoke \nEmployment Authorization Documents ... for the remaining duration of their validity periods.”  \nRescission Policy at 4 (AR 255) (emphasis added).  Again, Plaintiffs identify no member claiming \notherwise. \nFinally,  Plaintiffs  contend  that  DHS  withdrew  a  promise  “not  to  use  information” \nsubmitted  by  DACA  applicants  “against  them  or  [their]  family  members  in  enforcement \nproceedings.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 61; see also id. ¶ 57 (the “termination of the DACA program is \n 38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 52 of 58\n \naccompanied by withdrawal of th[at] guarantee”).  That is doubly wrong:  not only does it misstate \nDHS’s information-sharing policy, but that policy has not in fact changed.  Under that policy, \ninformation submitted in DACA requests “is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the \npurpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the \nissuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’[s] Notice \nto Appear guidance” (for example, when issues of national security, public safety, or significant \ncriminal activity are raised).  DHS DACA FAQ No. 19 (emphasis added);7 see Notice to Appear \nGuidance.  While this policy “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time” and creates \nno legal rights, DHS DACA FAQ No. 19, nothing in the Rescission Policy purports to change it, \nand it currently remains in effect.  Notably, Plaintiffs once again point to no member who has been \nplaced in enforcement proceedings, or whose information has been shared with ICE, contrary to \nthis policy. \nThe Court should not defer to Plaintiffs’ obviously incorrect allegations, which identify no \n“broken promises” at all, much less a violation of due process.  See Kaempe v. Myers, 367 F.3d \n958, 963 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (courts need not “accept as true the complaint’s factual allegations \ninsofar as they contradict exhibits to the complaint or matters subject to judicial notice” (citation \nomitted)). \n                                                 \n7 The information-sharing policy continues:  “Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to \nDACA will not be referred to ICE.  The information may be shared with national security and law \nenforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for \nassistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national \nsecurity purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above \ninformation sharing policy covers family members and guardians, in addition to the requestor.  \nThis policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not \nintended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or \nprocedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.”  DHS \nDACA FAQ No. 19. \n 39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 53 of 58\n \n2.  There is no protected liberty or property interest in the receipt of \nDACA. \n \n  Even taking Plaintiffs’ allegations at face value, their due process claim fails as a threshold \nmatter, for they cannot show that DACA recipients have a protected liberty or property interest in \ndeferred action that would entitle them to due process protections. \nThe Fifth Amendment provides that “no person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  Thus, the “first inquiry in every \ndue process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in ‘property’ \nor ‘liberty.’”  Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59 (1999) (citation omitted).  The \n“Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a ‘benefit.’”  Town of \nCastle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  Rather, “[t]o have a property interest in a \nbenefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire and more than a unilateral \nexpectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.”  Id. (quoting Bd. \nof Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).  Such entitlements “are not created by the \nConstitution.  Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or \nunderstandings that stem from an independent source”—e.g., statutes or regulations—“that secure \ncertain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.”  Roth, 408 U.S. at 577. \nA benefit “is not a protected entitlement” where, as here, “government officials may grant \nor deny it in their discretion.”  Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756 (citation omitted).  For due process \npurposes, statutes or regulations limit discretion only when they contain “explicitly mandatory \nlanguage”—i.e., “specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations’ substantive \npredicates are present, a particular outcome must follow.”  Ky. Dep’t of Corrs. v. Thompson, 490 \nU.S. 454, 462–63 (1989) (citation omitted).   \n 40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 54 of 58\n \nThe DACA policy contains no such “explicitly mandatory language.”  Id. at 463. The \npolicy is codified in no statute or regulation.  Its source—the DACA Memo—describes it as a \n“policy” for the “exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”  DACA Memo 2, 3 (AR 2, 3); see Omar v. \nMcHugh, 646 F.3d 13, 22 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (the “use of the word ‘policy’”—“rather than a \nword  such  as  ‘right’—reinforces  the  conclusion  that  Congress  did  not  intend  to  create  an \n‘entitlement’”).  And the agency’s public guidance makes clear that, under DACA, deferred action \n“may be terminated at any time, with or without Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \ndiscretion.”  DHS DACA FAQ No. 27. \nThe D.C. Circuit has recognized that, under DACA, “deferred action remains discretionary \nand reversible, and ‘confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.’”  \nArpaio, 797 F.3d at 17 (quoting DACA Memo 3).  Thus, it is not a protected entitlement for due \nprocess purposes, and Plaintiffs’ claim fails as a matter of law.  See also, e.g., Velasco-Gutierrez \nv. Crossland, 732 F.2d 792, 798 (10th Cir. 1984) (deferred action guidance “places no effective \nlimitations on official discretion, and thus creates no protected liberty interest in deferred action”); \nDe Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1985) (because “deferred action” “vests the \nregional commissioner with unfettered discretion to determine whether to grant an informal \nadministrative stay of deportation to an otherwise deportable alien, it creates no protectible liberty \ninterest in deferred action, nor does it create a protectible interest in being considered for deferred \naction status”). \n3.  Changes in agency policy do not require individualized process. \n \n  Even if DACA could be conceived of as an entitlement, Plaintiffs’ due process claim would \nfail because changes in agency policy do not require individualized process.  Due process doctrine \nrecognizes a “distinction between individualized deprivations, [which] are protected by procedural \n 41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 55 of 58\n \ndue process, and policy-based deprivations of the interests of a class, [which] are not protected by \nprocedural due process.”  2 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 9.2 (5th ed. 2010).  \nThe rescission of DACA falls squarely in the latter category. \nPlaintiffs  allege  that,  under  DACA,  “termination  required  a  ‘notice  of  an  intent  to \nterminate’  that  provided  all  reasons  and  documents  supporting  the  termination,”  and  that \n“registrants were to be given an opportunity to submit evidence rebutting that termination.”  Am. \nCompl. ¶ 66.  But Plaintiffs theory is not that individual DACA applications were adjudicated \nincorrectly (for example, due to factual error)—the sort of mistake that notice and a hearing could \nconceivably help correct.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ claim appears to be that DHS cannot alter the DACA \npolicy, even on a prospective basis, without providing individualized notice and hearings to nearly \n800,000 recipients. \nSuch individualized process is not required.  The Supreme Court held long ago that where \na government policy “applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that everyone should \nhave a direct voice in its adoption,” and thus due process does not require individualized pre-\ndeprivation notice.  Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915).  \nThis case presents “the classic Bi-Metallic scenario”—the challenged policy applies across-the-\nboard to a large number of people, so “[n]ot only would individualized hearings be impractical, \nthey would be unnecessary.”  Decatur Liquors, Inc. v. Dist. of Columbia, 478 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C. \nCir. 2007) (citing Bi-Metallic, 239 U.S. at 445). \nThe Ninth Circuit’s decision in Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356 (9th Cir. 1980), is \ninstructive in this regard.  There, the INS had issued a policy directive granting “deferred voluntary \ndeparture”—a form of deferred action—to Iranian nationals who were unwilling to return home \ndue to political instability.  Id. at 1359.  Then, in response to the Iranian hostage crisis, the INS \n 42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 56 of 58\n \nissued another policy directive “rescinding the … deferred departure” and requiring its recipients \nto depart the country within 30 days.  Id.  Relying on Bi-Metallic, the Ninth Circuit rejected the \nplaintiff’s claim “that he should have had a prior opportunity to contest [the INS’s] decision to \nrescind deferred departure.”  Yassini, 618 F.2d at 1363.  “Where an agency action is not based on \nindividual grounds, but is a matter of  general policy,” the  court  explained, “no hearing is \nconstitutionally required.”  Id. (citing, inter alia, Bi-Metallic).  So too here. \nC.  Plaintiffs’  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  Claim  Fails  Because  Notice-and-\nComment Procedures Were Not Required \n \nPlaintiffs’ Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) claim fails for the same reasons as their \nnotice-and-comment claim, and it can be quickly dispatched.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 75–82 (Count \nIV).  The RFA’s requirement that an agency publish analyses of a rule’s impact on small businesses \napplies only “when an agency promulgates a final rule under section 553 of … title [5], after being \nrequired by that section or any other law to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking,” U.S. \nTelecom Ass’n v. FCC, 400 F.3d 29, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 604(a))—in other \nwords, only where notice-and-comment procedures are required.  Because those procedures were \nnot required here, see supra at § II(A)(2), the RFA does not apply.  See also, e.g., Broadgate, Inc. \nv. USCIS, 730 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (D.D.C. 2010) (the “Regulatory Flexibility Act ... only applies \nwhen an agency is required to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking” (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ \n603(a), 604(a))).8 \n                                                 \n8 While Defendants have already addressed Plaintiffs’ general lack of standing, see supra at §I(A), \n(B), Plaintiffs lacks standing to raise an RFA claim for an additional reason:  They allege no facts \nto demonstrate that they are “small entities” entitled to seek judicial review under the RFA.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 601(6) (defining “small entity”); id. § 611 (restricting judicial review to “a small entity \nthat is adversely affected or aggrieved”); see also, e.g., N.W. Mining Ass’n v. Babbitt, 5 F. Supp. \n2d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 1998) (“[T]he language of the RFA extends standing to seek judicial review only \nto a ‘small entity.’”).  Plaintiffs’ conclusory assertions on this score, see Am. Compl. ¶ 79, should \nnot be taken as true on a motion to dismiss.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 681. \n 43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 57 of 58\n \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Declaratory Relief “Claim” States No Independent Cause of Action \n \nIn Count I, Plaintiffs assert entitlement to declaratory relief, but no substantive cause of \naction.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51–58.  Because “[d]eclaratory relief is not an independent cause of action, \nand does not provide an independent source of federal jurisdiction,” Yancey v. Dist. of Columbia, \n991 F. Supp. 2d 171, 180 n.6 (D.D.C. Nov. 6, 2013) (citing Ali v. Rumsfeld, 649 F.3d 762, 778 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011)), this “claim” should also be dismissed. \nV.  NATIONWIDE DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS IMPERMISSIBLE \nPlaintiffs also seek injunctive relief preventing “Defendants from rescinding the DACA \nprogram,” and “from using information obtained in any DACA application or renewal request to \nidentify, apprehend, detain, or deport any DACA registrant … .”  Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief.  \nTo the extent this Court ultimately concludes that Plaintiffs are entitled to any injunction, it should \ndismiss the request for nationwide relief.  Both constitutional and equitable principles require that \ninjunctive relief be limited to redressing a plaintiff’s own cognizable injuries.  Article III demands \nthat “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing … for each form of relief that is sought.”  Town of \nChester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted).  “The remedy” \nsought thus must “be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff \nhas established.” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996).  “The actual-injury requirement would \nhardly serve [its] purpose … of preventing courts from undertaking tasks assigned to the political \nbranches[,] if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm from one particular inadequacy in government \nadministration, the court were authorized to remedy all inadequacies in that administration.”  Id.  \nAnd equitable principles independently require that an injunction “be no more burdensome to the \ndefendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Madsen v. Women’s Health \nCtr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted); see also Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed \n 44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-01907-CRC   Document 15   Filed 11/08/17   Page 58 of 58\n \nFarms, 561 U.S. 139, 163 (2010) (narrowing injunction in part because the plaintiffs “do not \nrepresent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order on the ground that it might cause \nharm to other parties”).  Accordingly, any injunction here should be limited to particular individual \nPlaintiffs found to have cognizable claims. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ motion and dismiss this \ncase. \nDated: November 8, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n            CHAD A.

In 2016, this Court af-\nfirmed, by an equally divided Court, a decision of the \nFifth Circuit holding that two related Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) discretionary enforcement \npolicies, including an expansion of the DACA policy, \nwere  likely  unlawful  and  should  be  enjoined.    See \nUnited States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (per curiam).  In \nSeptember  2017,  DHS  determined  that  the  original \nDACA policy was unlawful and would likely be struck \ndown by the courts on the same grounds as the related \npolicies.  DHS thus instituted an orderly wind-down of \nthe DACA policy.  The questions presented are as follows: \n1.  Whether DHS’s decision to wind down the DACA \npolicy is judicially reviewable. \n2.  Whether DHS’s decision to wind down the DACA \npolicy is lawful. \n \n(I) \n\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Donald J. Trump, President of the \nUnited States; Jefferson B. Sessions III, Attorney Gen-\neral of the United States; Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security; U.S. Citizenship and Immi-\ngration Services; U.S. Immigration and Customs En-\nforcement; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; \nand the United States.  \nRespondents are the Trustees of Princeton Univer-\nsity; Microsoft Corporation; Maria De La Cruz Perales \nSanchez; National Association for the Advancement of \nColored  People;  American  Federation  of  Teachers, \nAFL-CIO; and the United Food and Commercial Work-\ners International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC. \n(II) \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nReasons for granting the petition ............................................. 13 \nA.

CIRCUIT \n \nPETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI  \nBEFORE JUDGMENT \n \nThe Solicitor General, on behalf of the President of \nthe United States, Donald J. Trump, and other federal \nparties, respectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari be-\nfore judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe order of the district court granting respondents \nsummary  judgment  (App.  1a-74a)  is  reported  at  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 209.  The order of the district court de-\nclining to reconsider its prior order (App. 80a-109a) is \nreported at 315 F. Supp. 3d 457.   \nJURISDICTION \nOn April 24, 2018, the district court granted respond-\nents summary judgment (App. 1a-74a).   The district \ncourt declined to reconsider its prior order and entered \n(1) \n\n2 \nfinal judgment on August 3, 2018 (App. 80a-109a).  The \ngovernment filed its notice of appeal on August 6, 2018 \n(App. 112a-115a).  The court of appeals’ jurisdiction over \nthe appeal of the district court’s final judgment rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1291.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 28 U.S.C. 2101(e). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are set forth in the \nappendix to the petition for a writ of certiorari before \njudgment in United States Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, also \nfiled today.  Regents App. 127a-143a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1.  a.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),  \n8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., charges the Secretary of Home-\nland Security “with the administration and enforcement” \nof the immigration laws.  8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1).  Individual \naliens are subject to removal if, inter alia, “they were \ninadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted \nof certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal \nlaw.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012); \nsee 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) (2012 & Supp. V 2017); see also \n8 U.S.C. 1227(a) (2012 & Supp. V 2017).  As a practical \nmatter, however, the federal government cannot remove \nevery removable alien, and a “principal feature of the re-\nmoval system is the broad discretion exercised by immi-\ngration officials.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396.   \nFor  any  alien  subject  to  removal,  Department  of \nHomeland Security (DHS) officials must first “decide \nwhether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Ari-\nzona, 567 U.S. at 396.  After removal proceedings begin, \ngovernment officials may decide to grant discretionary \nrelief, such as asylum or cancellation of removal.  See  \n8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(1)(A), 1229b.  And, “[a]t each stage” of \n \n\n3 \nthe process, “the Executive has discretion to abandon the \nendeavor.”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (AADC).  In making \nthese decisions, like other agencies exercising enforce-\nment discretion, DHS must engage in “a complicated \nbalancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly \nwithin its expertise.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n831 (1985).  Recognizing the need for such balancing, \nCongress has provided that the “Secretary [of Home-\nland Security] shall be responsible for  * * *  [e]stablish-\ning national immigration enforcement policies and pri-\norities.”  6 U.S.C. 202(5) (2012 & Supp. V 2017). \nb. In  2012,  DHS  announced  the  policy  known  as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  See \nRegents App. 97a-101a.  Deferred action is a practice in \nwhich the Secretary exercises discretion to notify an al-\nien of her decision to forbear from seeking his removal \nfor a designated period.  AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Under \nDHS regulations, aliens granted deferred action may \napply for and receive work authorization for the dura-\ntion of the deferred-action grant if they establish eco-\nnomic necessity.  8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14).  A grant of de-\nferred action does not confer lawful immigration status \nor provide any defense to removal.  DHS retains discre-\ntion to revoke deferred action unilaterally, and the alien \nremains removable at any time. \nDACA  made deferred  action  available  to “certain \nyoung people who were brought to this country as chil-\ndren.”  Regents App. 97a.  The INA does not provide \nany exemptions or special relief from removal for such \nindividuals.  And, dating back to at least 2001, biparti-\nsan  efforts  to  provide  such  relief  legislatively  had \n \n\n4 \nfailed.1  Under the DACA policy, following successful \ncompletion of a background check and other review, an \nalien would receive deferred action for a period of two \nyears, subject to renewal.  Id. at 99a-100a.  The policy \nmade clear that it “confer[red] no substantive right, im-\nmigration status or pathway to citizenship,” because \n“[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative au-\nthority, can confer these rights.”  Id. at 101a. \nDHS  explained  that  information  provided  in  the \nDACA request process would be protected from disclo-\nsure for the purpose of immigration enforcement pro-\nceedings unless certain criteria related to national secu-\nrity or public safety were satisfied, or the individual met \nthe requirements for a Notice to Appear.  USCIS, DHS, \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals:  Frequently \nAsked  Questions  (Mar.  8,  2018),  https://go.usa.gov/ \nxngCd.  DHS also stated, however, that this information- \nsharing policy  “may be  modified, superseded,  or re-\nscinded at any time without notice,” and that it “may not \nbe relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive \nor procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any ad-\nministrative, civil, or criminal matter.”  Id. at 6.   \nLater, in 2014, DHS created a new policy of enforce-\nment discretion referred to as Deferred Action for Par-\nents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  See Regents App. 102a-110a.  Through a pro-\ncess  expressly  designed  to  be  “similar  to  DACA,” \nDAPA made deferred action available for certain indi-\nviduals who had a child who was a U.S. citizen or lawful \npermanent resident.  Id. at 107a.  At the same time, \n                                                      \n1  See,  e.g.,  S.  1291,  107th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  (2001);  S.  1545,  \n108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003); S. 2075, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2005);  \nS. 2205, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. (2007); S. 3827, 111th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(2010). \n \n\n5 \nDHS also expanded DACA by extending the deferred-\naction period from two to three years and by loosening \nthe age and residency criteria.  Id. at 106a-107a.  \nc.  Soon  thereafter,  Texas  and  25  other  States \nbrought suit in the Southern District of Texas to enjoin \nDAPA and the expansion of DACA.  The district court \nissued a nationwide preliminary injunction, finding a \nlikelihood of success on the claim that the DAPA and \nexpanded DACA memorandum was a “ ‘substantive’ rule \nthat should have undergone the notice-and-comment rule \nmaking  procedure”  required  by  the  Administrative  \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.  Texas v. \nUnited States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 671 (S.D. Tex. 2015); \nsee id. at 607, 647, 664-678.   \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction, holding \nthat the DAPA and expanded DACA policies likely vio-\nlated both  the APA and  the INA.   Texas  v.  United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134, 146, 170-186 (2015).  The court of \nappeals concluded that plaintiffs had “established a sub-\nstantial likelihood of success on the merits of their pro-\ncedural claim” that DAPA and expanded DACA were \ninvalidly instituted without notice and comment.  Id. at \n178.  The court also concluded, “as an alternate and ad-\nditional ground,” that the policies were substantively \ncontrary to law.  Ibid.  The court observed that the INA \ncontains an “intricate system of immigration classifica-\ntions and employment eligibility,” and “does not grant \nthe Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and \nlawful presence on a class-wide basis to 4.3 million oth-\nerwise removable aliens.”  Id. at 184, 186 n.202.  It also \nnoted that Congress had repeatedly declined to enact \nlegislation  “closely  resembl[ing]  DACA  and  DAPA.”  \nId. at 185.   \n \n\n6 \nAfter briefing and argument, this Court affirmed the \nFifth Circuit’s judgment by an equally divided Court, \nUnited States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271, 2272 (2016) (per \ncuriam), leaving the nationwide injunction in place.    \nd. In June 2017, Texas and other plaintiff States in \nthe Texas case announced their intention to amend their \ncomplaint to challenge the original DACA policy.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 60, at 238-240 (Feb. 16, 2018).2  They asserted that \n“[f ]or the[] same reasons that DAPA and Expanded \nDACA’s unilateral Executive Branch conferral of eligi-\nbility for lawful presence and work authorization was \nunlawful, the original June 15, 2012 DACA memoran-\ndum is also unlawful.”  Id. at 239.    \nOn September 5, 2017, rather than confront litiga-\ntion challenging DACA on essentially the same grounds \nthat had succeeded in Texas before the same court for \nthe DAPA and expanded DACA policies, DHS decided \nto wind down DACA in an orderly fashion.  Regents \nApp. 111a-119a.  In the rescission memorandum, then-\nActing Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke \nexplained  that,  “[t]aking  into  consideration  the  Su-\npreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the on-\ngoing litigation,” as well as the Attorney General’s view \nthat the DACA policy was unlawful and that the “poten-\ntially imminent” challenge to DACA would “likely  * * *  \nyield similar results” as the Texas litigation, “it is clear \nthat the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be termi-\nnated.”  Id. at 116a-117a.  The Acting Secretary accord-\ningly announced that, “[i]n the exercise of [her] author-\nity in establishing national immigration policies and pri-\norities,”  the  original  DACA  memorandum  was  “re-\nscind[ed].”  Id. at 117a.  \n                                                      \n2  Citations to the district court docket are to Trustees of Prince-\nton University  v. United States, No. 17-cv-2325.   \n \n\n7 \nThe rescission memorandum stated, however, that \nthe government “[w]ill not terminate the grants of pre-\nviously issued deferred action  * * *  solely based on the \ndirectives in this memorandum” for the remaining two-\nyear periods.  Regents App. 118a.  The memorandum \nalso explained that DHS would “provide a limited win-\ndow in which it w[ould] adjudicate certain requests for \nDACA.”  Id. at 117a.  Specifically, DHS would “adjudicate \n—on an individual, case by case basis—properly filed \npending DACA renewal requests  * * *  from current \nbeneficiaries that have been accepted by the Depart-\nment as of the date of this memorandum, and from cur-\nrent beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between \nthe date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that \nhave been accepted by the Department as of October 5, \n2017.”  Id. at 117a-118a. \nDHS has also made clear that the “information-sharing \npolicy has not changed in any way since it was first an-\nnounced,  including  as  a  result  of  the  Sept.  5,  2017” \nDACA rescission. USCIS, DHS, Guidance on Rejected \nDACA  Requests  (Feb.  14,  2018),  https://go.usa.gov/ \nxPVmG; see USCIS, DHS, Frequently Asked Questions:  \nRescission of DACA (Sept. 5, 2017), https://go.usa.gov/ \nxPVmE.   \ne.  Shortly after DHS’s decision to rescind DACA, \nrespondents brought these two related suits in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia challenging the rescission of DACA. \nCollectively, they allege that the termination of DACA \nis unlawful because it is arbitrary and capricious under \nthe APA; violates the APA’s requirement for notice-\nand-comment  rulemaking  as  well  as  the  Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; denies respondents \nequal protection and due process; and permits the gov-\nernment to use information obtained through DACA in \n \n\n8 \na manner that is inconsistent with due-process princi-\nples.  See App. 17a-18a.  Similar challenges were filed \nin the Eastern District of New York and in the North-\nern District of California.  See Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, \nNo. 16-cv-4756 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 19, 2017); Regents \nof the Univ. of Cal. v. DHS, No. 17-cv-5211 (N.D. Cal. \nfiled Sept. 8, 2017).  A summary of the proceedings in \nthe District of Columbia (NAACP) follows in this peti-\ntion.  A summary of the proceedings in the other district \ncourts can be found in the government’s petitions in \nthose cases, filed simultaneously with this one.3 \n2.  In NAACP, the government filed motions to dis-\nmiss both suits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(1) and (6).  D. Ct. Doc. 15 (Nov. 8, 2017).  At the \nthreshold,  the  government  argued  that  respondents’ \nclaims are not reviewable because DHS’s decision to re-\nscind DACA is committed to agency discretion by law, \nsee 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2); and because judicial review of the \ndenial of deferred action, if available at all, is barred un-\nder the INA prior to the issuance of a final removal or-\nder, see 8 U.S.C. 1252.  The government also argued \nthat respondents’ arbitrary-and-capricious claims fail \nbecause DHS rationally explained the decision to wind \ndown the discretionary DACA policy given the Acting \nSecretary’s conclusion that the policy is unlawful and \nthe imminent risk of its being invalidated in the Texas \ncase.  Finally, the government argued that respondents’ \nother claims are without merit because the rescission of \nDACA  is  exempt  from  notice-and-comment  require-\nments; does not violate principles of equal protection or \n                                                      \n3  The government largely prevailed in a similar challenge to the \nrescission filed in the District of Maryland.  See Casa de Maryland \nv. DHS, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  An appeal of that decision is \npending before the Fourth Circuit.   \n \n\n9 \ndue process; and does not change or affect the policies \ngoverning the use of aliens’ personal information. \nRespondents opposed the government’s motions to \ndismiss and filed a motion for summary judgment or, in \nthe alternative, a preliminary injunction preventing the \ngovernment from rescinding the DACA policy and from \nmodifying its information-sharing policy.  D. Ct. Docs. \n23, 28 (Dec. 15, 2017).  \n3.  On April 24, 2018, the district court entered an or-\nder granting respondents summary judgment and vacat-\ning the agency’s rescission of DACA.  App. 1a-74a.  \nThe district  court first rejected the government’s \njusticiability arguments.  The court concluded that the \nINA did not preclude review of respondents’ claims be-\nfore a final order of removal on the ground that “there \nis no allegation here that removal proceedings have yet \nbeen initiated against any DACA beneficiary, so there \nare no pending removal proceedings with which [re-\nspondents’] challenge might interfere.”  App. 21a.  And \nthe court determined that the rescission of DACA was \nnot “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C \n701(a)(2), on the ground that Section 701(a)(2) does not \napply to an agency’s rescission of “a general enforce-\nment policy predicated on [a] legal determination that \nthe program was invalid.”  App. 43a.  The court also rea-\nsoned that litigation risk “is insufficiently independent \nfrom the agency’s evaluation of DACA’s legality to trig-\nger Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability.”  Ibid.  \nOn the merits, the district court concluded that the \nrescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA \nbecause the rescission memorandum’s “legal reasoning \nwas insufficient to satisfy the Department’s obligation \nto explain its departure from its prior stated view that \nDACA was lawful.”  App. 51a.  The court acknowledged \n \n\n10 \nthat the memorandum cited the Fifth Circuit’s decision \nin Texas.  Ibid.  But the court interpreted that decision \nas holding only that “DAPA likely conflicted with the \nINA’s ‘intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a law-\nful immigration classification from their children’s im-\nmigration status.’ ”  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court \nreasoned that, “unlike DAPA, ‘DACA has “no analogue \nin the INA,” ’ ” and thus the Fifth Circuit’s analysis was \n“inapposite.”  Ibid. (citations omitted).  The court also \nconcluded that DHS had failed to adequately consider \nreliance interests of DACA recipients who had struc-\ntured their affairs “on the assumption that they would \nbe able to renew their DACA benefits.”  App. 54a.  Fi-\nnally, the court determined that DHS’s litigation-risk \nconcern was arbitrary and capricious because, if a court \nwere to find DACA unlawful under the Texas decision, \nit would have had “ ‘broad discretion’ to ‘fashion[] equi-\ntable relief,’ ” such as allowing DHS an “opportunity to \nwind the program down.”  App. 58a (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).      \nThe district court rejected respondents’ claim that the \nrescission  should  have  undergone  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, explaining that the rescission was “exempt \nfrom notice and comment as a general statement of \nagency policy.”  App. 48a.  And the court dismissed the \nrespondents’ claim against DHS’s alleged change in its \ninformation-sharing policy.  App. 71a-72a.  The court \nreasoned that, in light of DHS’s recent public state-\nments that the policy was unchanged, respondents had \nnot “plausibly allege[d] that DACA beneficiaries’ infor-\nmation  has  been  or  will  be  used  inconsistently  with \nDHS’s stated information-sharing policy.”  App. 72a.  \n \n\n11 \nFinally, the court deferred ruling on respondents’ \nequal-protection and due-process challenges to the re-\nscission of DACA.  App. 66a-67a.  And the court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to “reissue a memorandum rescinding DACA, \nthis time providing a fuller explanation.”  App. 66a. \n4.  On June 22, 2018, current Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Kirstjen Nielsen issued a memorandum in re-\nsponse to the district court’s invitation.  Regents App. \n120a-126a.    In  her  memorandum,  Secretary  Nielsen \nconcluded that “the DACA policy properly was—and \nshould be—rescinded, for several separate and inde-\npendently sufficient reasons.”  App. 122a.  First, the \nSecretary agreed that “the DACA policy was contrary \nto law” and explained that “[a]ny arguable distinctions \nbetween the DAPA and DACA policies” were not “suf-\nficiently material” to convince her otherwise.  Ibid.; see \nApp. 122a-123a.  Second, the Secretary reasoned that, \nin  any  event,  “[l]ike  Acting  Secretary  Duke,  [she] \nlack[s] sufficient confidence in the DACA policy’s legal-\nity to continue this non-enforcement policy, whether the \ncourts would ultimately uphold it or not.” App. 123a.  \nShe noted that “[t]here are sound reasons for a law en-\nforcement agency to avoid discretionary policies that \nare legally questionable.”  App. 122a-123a.  Third, the \nSecretary offered several “reasons of enforcement pol-\nicy to rescind the DACA policy,” regardless of whether \nthe policy is “illegal or legally questionable.”  App. 123a.  \nThe Secretary also explained that, although she “do[es] \nnot come to these conclusions lightly,” “neither any in-\ndividual’s reliance on the expected continuation of the \nDACA  policy  nor  the  sympathetic  circumstances  of \nDACA recipients as a class” outweigh the reasons to \nend the policy.  App. 125a.   \n \n\n12 \n5.  On August 3, 2018, the district court denied the \ngovernment’s motion to reconsider its prior order in \nlight of Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum.  App. 80a-\n109a.  The court largely accepted that the Nielsen mem-\norandum provided a relevant “ ‘further explanation’ ” for \nDHS’s decision, rather than (as respondents’ urged) an \nimpermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  App. 91a (ci-\ntation omitted).4  But it concluded that the memoran-\ndum did not provide a basis to revisit its reviewability \nor merits determinations.  App. 95a-108a.  \nOn reviewability, the district court observed that the \nNielsen  memorandum,  like  the  rescission  memoran-\ndum, was based in part on the view that “the DACA pol-\nicy was contrary to law.”  App. 97a (citation omitted).  \nAnd the court reasoned that “ ‘an otherwise reviewable’ \nlegal  interpretation  ‘does  not  become  presumptively  \nunreviewable simply because the agency characterizes it \nas an exercise of enforcement discretion.’ ”  App. 95a-96a \n(citation omitted).  It rejected the independent non-legal \npolicy reasons offered by Secretary Nielsen as simply an \n“attempt to disguise an objection to DACA’s legality as \na policy justification for its rescission.”  App. 100a.   \nOn the merits, the district court reaffirmed its con-\nclusion that the rescission of DACA is arbitrary and ca-\npricious because it did not find DHS’s explanation to in-\nclude a sufficient “legal assessment that th[e] [c]ourt \n                                                      \n4  The  district  court  refused  to  consider  one  of  the  several  \nenforcement-policy reasons offered by the Secretary on the ground \nthat it was a post hoc rationalization—namely, the importance for \nDHS to “project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, \nconsistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws \nagainst all classes and categories of aliens,” Regents App. 124a.  See \nApp. 94a.   \n \n\n13 \ncould subject to judicial review.”  App. 105a.  As for Sec-\nretary Nielsen’s other rationales, the court expressed \nskepticism that the Secretary actually considered them \nto be “ ‘independently sufficient’ ” given the court’s con-\nclusion that “three of those grounds—the substantial-\ndoubts, legislative-inaction, and individualized-discretion \nrationales—simply recapitulate the Secretary’s inade-\nquately explained legal assessment.” App. 106a (citation \nomitted).  In any event, the court reasoned that the Sec-\nretary’s  memorandum  “fails  to  engage  meaningfully \nwith the reliance interests and other countervailing fac-\ntors that weigh against ending the program.”  Ibid.  In \nthe court’s view, Secretary Nielsen “demonstrates no \ntrue cognizance of the serious reliance interests at issue \nhere” and therefore the court refused to “accept as suf-\nficient” her determination that “any reliance interests \nare  outweighed”  by  the  Secretary’s  other  concerns \nabout the DACA policy.  App. 107a. \nThe government filed notices of appeal from the dis-\ntrict court’s final judgment on August 6, 2018.  App. \n112a-115a.  On August 17, the district court stayed its \norder vacating the rescission of DACA insofar as the or-\nder granted relief beyond that already granted by the dis-\ntrict courts in Regents and Batalla Vidal.  D. Ct. Doc. 31.      \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThese cases concern the Executive Branch’s author-\nity to revoke a discretionary policy of non-enforcement \nthat is sanctioning an ongoing violation of federal immi-\ngration law by nearly 700,000 aliens.  The DACA policy \nis materially indistinguishable from the related policies \nthat the Fifth Circuit held were contrary to federal im-\nmigration law in a decision that four Justices of this \nCourt voted to affirm.  No one contends that the policy \nis required by federal law.  And, in fact, consistent with \n \n\n14 \nthe view of the Department of Justice, DHS has decided \nthat the policy is unlawful and should be adopted only \nby  legislative  action,  not  unilateral  executive  action.  \nYet as a result of nationwide preliminary injunctions is-\nsued by the District Courts in the Northern District of \nCalifornia and the Eastern District of New York, DHS \nhas been required to keep the policy in place, now more \nthan a year since the agency’s decision.     \nThe government today is filing petitions for writs of \ncertiorari before judgment to the Second, Ninth, and \nD.C. Circuits, each of which has before it a decision con-\ncluding that the rescission of DACA either is or likely is \nunlawful.  As explained in the Regents petition, those \ndecisions are wrong and they warrant this Court’s im-\nmediate review.  The government presents each of these \npetitions to ensure that the Court has an adequate ve-\nhicle in which to resolve the questions presented in a \ntimely and definitive manner.  The government respect-\nfully submits that the Court should grant each petition \nfor  a  writ  of  certiorari before  judgment,  consolidate \nthese cases for decision, and consider this important \ndispute this Term. \nA.  The Questions Presented Warrant The Court’s Immediate \nReview \nThe government’s petition in Regents explains in de-\ntail why a grant of certiorari is necessary in order to \nobtain an appropriately prompt resolution of this im-\nportant dispute.  Regents Pet. 15-17.  More than eight \nmonths ago, this Court recognized the need for an “ex-\npeditious[]” resolution of this dispute in its order dis-\nmissing without prejudice the government’s petition for \na writ of certiorari before judgment in Department of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the University of Califor-\nnia, 138 S. Ct. 1182 (2018).  Absent certiorari before \n \n\n15 \njudgment, even if a losing party were immediately to \nseek certiorari from a decision of one of the courts of \nappeals, this Court would not be able to review that de-\ncision in the ordinary course until next Term at the ear-\nliest.  In the interim, the government would be required \nto retain a discretionary non-enforcement policy that \nDHS  and  the  Attorney  General  have  correctly  con-\ncluded is unlawful and that sanctions the ongoing viola-\ntion of federal law by more than half a million people.  \nAnd the very existence of this litigation (and resulting \nuncertainty) would continue to impede efforts to enact \nlegislation  addressing  the  legitimate  policy  concerns \nunderlying the DACA policy.     \nB. These Cases Squarely Present The Reviewability And \nThe Lawfulness Of DACA’s Rescission \nThe cases pending before the D.C. Circuit squarely \npresent both of the questions presented.  The respond-\nents raise all of the principal challenges to the lawful-\nness of the rescission of DACA, including that it is arbi-\ntrary and capricious, that it should have gone through \nnotice-and-comment  rulemaking,  and  that  it  violates \nequal-protection and due-process principles.  The gov-\nernment moved to dismiss all of respondents’ claims on \njusticiability  and  merits  grounds.    Respondents  op-\nposed dismissal for all of their claims and moved for \nsummary judgment on the arbitrary-and-capricious and \nnotice-and-comment claims.  And the district court’s fi-\nnal judgment rests on essentially the same arbitrary-\nand-capricious claim on which the district courts in Re-\ngents and Batalla Vidal rest their nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions.   \nThese  cases,  moreover,  present  at  least  one  ad-\nvantage over the cases at issue in Regents and Batalla \nVidal.    Secretary  Nielsen  issued  her  memorandum, \n \n\n16 \nwhich provides further explanation for DHS’s decision \nto rescind DACA, in response to an order from the dis-\ntrict court in these cases.  And she did so after the deci-\nsions in Regents and Batalla Vidal were on appeal.  As \na result, the district court here is the only court to have \naddressed the effect of that memorandum on the ques-\ntions presented (including by considering and rejecting \nrespondents’ arguments that Secretary Nielsen’s expla-\nnation should be disregarded in its entirety as post hoc \nrationalization).        \nA grant of certiorari before judgment to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit would therefore ensure that the district court’s anal-\nysis of Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum is before this \nCourt, and it would allow the Court to resolve, at a mini-\nmum, the government’s justiciability arguments and the \narbitrary-and-capricious claim after a final judgment.  \nC.  The Court Should Grant Each Of The Government’s  \nPetitions And Consolidate The Cases For Consideration \nThis Term   \nTo ensure an adequate vehicle for the timely and de-\nfinitive resolution of this dispute, in addition to granting \nthe  government’s  petition  in  these  cases,  the  Court \nshould also grant the petitions for a writ of certiorari be-\nfore judgment in Regents and Batalla Vidal, and consol-\nidate the cases for further review.  Although respondents \nhere present the principal challenges against the rescis-\nsion of DACA, they do not present some of the more tan-\ngential claims against the rescission, including, for exam-\nple, that the rescission violates principles of equitable es-\ntoppel, and their equal-protection challenge is premised \non DHS’ alleged discrimination on the basis of DACA re-\ncipients’  unlawful  immigration  status,  not  their  race.  \nThe district court in these cases, moreover, did not pass \non any constitutional challenges to the rescission.      \n \n\n17 \nThe government thus respectfully submits that the \nCourt should grant all three petitions and consolidate \nthe cases for this Court’s review.  In so doing, the Court \nwould ensure that no intervening developments in the \nlower courts—for example, a reversal by the Second or \nNinth Circuits of one of the preliminary injunctions—\nwould impede or complicate the Court’s ability to reach \nall  of  the  claims  against  the rescission  of DACA  on \nwhich respondents have prevailed in the lower courts \nand thus provide a definitive resolution of this dispute \nthis Term.        \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment \nshould be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n  NOEL J.

Ct. R. 11......................................................... 13, 14 \n \n\n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe government seeks certiorari before judgment \nin  this  case  based  primarily  on  the  pendency  of  its \npetition in a different case that is itself a poor candidate \nfor  review.1  That  case,  United  States  Department  of \nHomeland  Security  v.  Regents  of  the  University  of \nCalifornia,  No.  18-587,  arrives  to  the  Court  on  an \ninterlocutory posture without a circuit split. And the \ngovernment makes no credible case for interlocutory \nreview. The DACA program has been in place since \n2012.  The  program  was  essentially  unchallenged \nthrough  the  past  administration,  and  the  current \nadministration voluntarily maintained the program for \nmore  than  eight  months  before  rescinding  it.  Even \nupon  rescission,  the  administration  allowed  many \nrecipients to renew their status once more, effectively \ncontinuing the program into 2020. The government has \nnot sought to stay the preliminary injunctions issued by \nvarious  courts  while  the  parties  litigate  the  Regents \nrespondents’  claims.  Those  injunctions  are  limited  to \nallowing  existing  DACA  recipients  to  renew  their \nstatus; they do not compel the government to consider \nnew DACA applications, and they do not allow DACA \nrecipients  to  leave  the  country  and  return  using \n                                                 \n1 Although Respondents brought two separate cases, they were \nlitigated in the district court as one, and are treated in the Petition \nas one. Respondents submit a single Brief in Opposition and will \nrefer  to  their  related  cases  in  the  singular.  Respondents  will \nlikewise refer to the three related Regents cases in the singular, \nand to the two related Batalla Vidal cases in the singular.  See \nKirstjen M. Nielsen v. Martin Jonathan Batalla Vidal, No. 18-\n589. \n \n\n2 \nadvance parole. In short, the government’s actions in \nthis case demonstrate a lack of urgency in rescinding \nDACA that belies its current assertion that this Court \nshould review the Regents decision immediately. These \nand  other  arguments  are  set  forth  in  the  briefs  in \nopposition submitted by the respondents in the Regents \ncase, and Respondents adopt them in full. \nStripped of the false sense of urgency created by \nthe  government’s  invocation  of  the  Regents  decision, \nthere is nothing left of the government’s petition for \ncertiorari  before  judgment  here,  and  it  should  be \ndenied. This case is presently being briefed before the \nD.C. Circuit and will likely be argued in early 2019. \nUnder this Court’s rules, certiorari before judgment is \nwarranted only where the petitioner establishes that \n“the case is of such imperative public importance as to \njustify deviation from normal appellate practice and to \nrequire immediate determination in this Court.” Sup. \nCt. R. 11. It is thus the “extremely rare” case that is \nappropriate for such review. Coleman v. Paccar Inc., \n424  U.S.  1301,  1304  n.*  (1976)  (Rehnquist,  J.,  in \nchambers); see 28 U.S.C. § 2101(e). This case does not \nmeet that standard. And even if it did, the Court should \ndeny review because the district court correctly held \nthat DACA’s rescission was reviewable and unlawful.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI.  DACA \nPrior to 2012, millions of young people raised in this \ncountry were compelled by circumstances beyond their \ncontrol to live in the shadows. Brought here as children, \nthey  attended  American  schools,  contributed  to \n \n\n3 \nAmerican  communities,  and  strived  to  achieve \nAmerican dreams. But because they were not lawfully \npresent,  their  lives  did  not  resemble  those  of  their \nAmerican  classmates:  They  often  could  not  secure \ngovernment-issued  identification  and,  accordingly, \ncould  not  travel  by  plane  to  visit  family  or  attend \ncollege  far  from  home;  they  could  not  secure  work \nauthorization;  they  generally  could  not  open  bank \naccounts, obtain credit cards, or engage in commercial \nactivity requiring access to credit; they could not access \npublic benefits and, in many cases, health insurance; \nthey could not enlist in the Armed Forces; and they \nlived in constant fear of law enforcement, with whom \nany interaction might mean deportation to a country \nthat was foreign to them. \nDespite  these  hardships,  many  of  these  young \npeople triumphed. They worked hard and excelled in \nschool,  developed  talents  and  professional  skills,  and \ncontributed to their families and communities. Known \nas “Dreamers,” they achieved these accomplishments \nnotwithstanding  their  status  under  the  immigration \nlaws. From the perspective of immigration authorities, \nthey  were—and  still  are—a  low  priority  for \nenforcement.  AR  1;  infra  pp.  16-17.2  From  the \nperspective of most Americans, regardless of political \naffiliation, they were—and still are—individuals with \nthe values and work ethic America cherishes, and they \n                                                 \n2  “AR”  refers  to  the  administrative  record  filed  by  the \ngovernment in these proceedings. Dkt. 8-3; see also Regents of the \nUniversity of California, et al. v. DHS, et al., Case No. 3:17-cv-\n05211 (N.D. Cal.), ECF No. 64-1. All references to “Dkt.” are to \ndocuments filed in the district court in No. 17-cv-2325.  \n \n\n4 \ndeserve to live their lives in the only country many \nhave known.3   \nIn  2012,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security \n(DHS) sought to address the plight of the Dreamers. \nConsistent with its longstanding authority to establish \ndeferred-action programs. Pet. App. 3a-4a; AR 15-23. \nDHS  thus  established  the  Deferred  Action  for \nChildhood Arrivals program (DACA). Pet. App. 5a.  \nBy  statute  and  regulation  separate  and  distinct \nfrom  the  DACA  program,  all  persons  subject  to \ndeferred action—whether under DACA or any other \nprogram—may access certain benefits in recognition of \ntheir  continued  presence  in  the  United  States.  They \nmay seek work authorization. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). \nThey may request advance parole to travel abroad and \nre-enter the United States. Id. § 212.5(f). And they are \neligible  for  driver’s  licenses,  health  insurance,  and \ncertain  public  programs.  8  U.S.C.  §  1611(b)(2)-(3) \n(Social  Security  and  Medicare);  id.  §  1621(d)  (state \nbenefits); 42 C.F.R. §§ 417.422(h), 422.50(a)(7) (health \ninsurance). \nBefore  the  DACA  program  was  instituted,  the \nOffice  of  Legal  Counsel  (OLC)  advised  DHS  that \nDACA  was  lawful  so  long  as  “immigration  officials \nretained discretion to evaluate each application on an \nindividualized  basis.”  Pet.  App.  53a  n.22  (quotation \n                                                 \n3NPR Poll: 2 in 3 Support Legal Status for DREAMers; Majority \nOppose Building a Wall, NPR: All Things Considered (Feb. 6, \n2018),  https://tinyurl.com/yblhrs2d;  Scott  Clement  &  David \nNakamura, Survey Finds Strong Support for ‘Dreamers’, Wash. \nPost (Sept. 25, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/ybqvqajx. \n \n\n5 \nmarks omitted). OLC later memorialized its analysis in \na  33-page  memorandum  that  primarily  addressed  a \n2014 proposed program known as “Deferred Action for \nParents  of  Americans  and  Lawful  Permanent \nResidents”  (DAPA).  Pet.  App.  52a-53a.  In  its \nmemorandum addressing DAPA, the OLC noted, “[t]he \nconcerns animating DACA were . . . consistent with the \ntypes  of  concerns  that  have  customarily  guided  the \nexercise of immigration enforcement discretion.” Pet. \nApp.  53a  n.22  (quotation  marks  omitted;  ellipsis  in \noriginal). \nDACA went into force in 2012, and by all accounts, \nDACA  has  been  successful  in  enabling  hundreds  of \nthousands of young people to pursue higher education \nand work legally, without the fear of deportation. Pet. \nApp.  54a.  Today,  DACA  recipients  make  substantial \ncontributions  to  the  U.S.  economy,  in  addition  to \nserving their communities and in this nation’s military.  \nSeparately,  DHS  sought  to  implement  DAPA. \nDAPA  would  have  extended  eligibility  for  deferred \naction  to  approximately  4  million  parents  of  U.S. \ncitizens  or  lawful  permanent  residents  who  were \nthemselves  unlawfully  present  in  the  United  States. \nAR  33.  DAPA  also  purported  to  expand  the  DACA \nprogram in certain minor respects. AR 39-40 (changing \nfrom  two  to  three-year  extension  terms,  adjusting \ndate-of-entry  requirement,  and  removing  age  cap). \nDAPA  never  went  into  effect,  however,  because  a \ncoalition of states led by Texas secured a preliminary \ninjunction based on the agency’s failure to follow the \n \n\n6 \nAPA’s notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.4 \nPet. App. 6a. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that \nthe states had demonstrated a likelihood of success on \nthe merits not only of their procedural APA claim, but \nalso  of  their  substantive  APA  claim,  because  DAPA \nappeared to conflict with the INA’s “intricate process \nfor  illegal  aliens  to  derive  a  lawful  immigration \nclassification from their children’s immigration status.” \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 146, 179 (5th Cir. \n2015).  This  Court  granted  a  petition  for  a  writ  of \ncertiorari  but  divided  evenly,  thereby  affirming  the \npreliminary injunction. See United States v. Texas, 136 \nS. Ct. 2271 (2016). The government sought rehearing, \nnoting that the country lacked a “definitive ruling” on \nDAPA’s legality. Dkt. 28-16 at 2504. That petition was \ndenied. United States v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 285 (2016). \nEven after President Trump took office, DHS opted \nto maintain DACA. In February 2017, then-Secretary \nof Homeland Security Kelly repealed a broad array of \nimmigration  directives  but  specifically  exempted \nDACA.  AR  230.  As  he  later  explained,  he  viewed \n“DACA  status”  as  a  “commitment  …  by  the \ngovernment towards the DACA person.” Dkt. 28-15 at \n1922. In June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded DAPA, \nbut again left DACA in place. AR 235-37. Likewise, in \npublic comments the President said “dreamers should \nrest  easy,”  characterizing  the  “policy  of  [his] \nadministration . . . to allow the dreamers to stay.” Dkt. \n28-15 at 1939-40. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n4 The states expressly declined to challenge DACA, which had \nalready been in place for two years.\n(cid:3)\n\n7 \nIn  June  2017,  approximately  the  time  Secretary \nKelly made his second decision to leave DACA in place, \nAttorney General Sessions and other members of the \nJustice  Department  communicated  with  attorneys \ngeneral from several of the states that had challenged \nDAPA in the Texas case. Dkt. 28-15 at 1951-52. Those \nconversations  culminated  in  a  letter  from  the  state \nattorneys  general  to  Attorney  General  Sessions  on \nJune 29, 2017. AR 238-40. Although the states had not \nchallenged DACA in the five years since it had been \nimplemented,  the  letter  asserted  that  DACA  was \nunlawful  and  asked  Defendants  to  “phase  out  the \nDACA  program”;  if  Defendants  did  not  do  so,  the \nstates said, they would amend their years-old complaint \nagainst DAPA to challenge DACA for the first time. \nAR 239. \nOn September 4, 2017, Attorney General Sessions \nannounced,  in  a  one-page  letter,  that  DACA  was \n“unconstitutional”  and  lacked  “statutory  authority.” \nAR  251.  The  letter  provided  no  legal  analysis,  but \nsimply referenced the Texas DAPA litigation and the \n“potentially imminent litigation” over DACA. AR 251. \nThe next day, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nDuke  issued  a  memorandum  rescinding  DACA  (the \n“Duke Memorandum”). AR 252-56. After describing the \ncourse of the Texas litigation and reciting the Attorney \nGeneral’s conclusion that DACA was unlawful, Acting \nSecretary Duke simply announced that it was “clear” \nthat DACA should be terminated. AR 255. \nThe  Duke  Memorandum  instructed  DHS  to  stop \naccepting new initial DACA applications and approving \nnew applications for advance parole; to accept renewal \n \n\n8 \napplications  from  individuals  whose  current  deferred \naction would expire by March 5, 2018; and to accept \nsuch renewals until October 5, 2017. AR 255. \nII.  Proceedings Below \nRespondents  sued  in  the  United  States  District \nCourt  for  the  District  of  Columbia  to  challenge  the \ndecision to rescind DACA. In April 2018, Judge John D. \nBates  granted  Respondents’  motion  for  summary \njudgment, holding the agency’s decision unlawful and \nsetting  it  aside.  Judge  Bates  concluded  that  the \nrescission  of  DACA  was  reviewable  and  that  the \nreasons given to support it were inadequate under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). Pet. App. 72a-\n74a.  In  particular,  Judge  Bates  held  that  the \ngovernment  could  not  overcome  the  “strong \npresumption favoring judicial review of administrative \naction.” Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, \n1651 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). And he \nheld  that  DACA’s  rescission  was  arbitrary  and \ncapricious because the government “failed adequately \nto  explain  its  conclusion  that  the  program  was \nunlawful.” Pet. App. 2a. Judge Bates stayed the order \nof vacatur for ninety days to allow DHS to attempt to \nremedy  the  Duke  Memorandum’s  inadequacies.  Pet. \nApp. 66a.  \nIn June 2018, Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen issued \na new memorandum “concur[ring] with and declin[ing] \nto disturb” the Duke Memorandum. Pet. App. 81a, 86a. \nThe government then moved Judge Bates to revise the \nApril 2018 order and uphold the Duke Memorandum. \nPet. App. 81a. \n \n\n9 \nIn  August  2018,  Judge  Bates  issued  an  opinion \ndenying the government’s motion to revise. The opinion \nwas  narrow:  “The  Court  did  not  hold  in  its  prior \nopinion, and it does not hold today, that DHS lacks the \nstatutory  or  constitutional  authority  to  rescind  the \nDACA program. Rather, the Court simply holds that if \nDHS wishes to rescind the program—or to take any \nother action, for that matter—it must give a rational \nexplanation for its decision.” Pet. App. 108a-109a (citing \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). Judge Bates found, once again, that \nDHS had failed to satisfy the bare minimum of rational \ndecisionmaking required by the APA. Pet. App. 108a-\n109a. \nThe  government  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  to  the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. \nPet.  App.  112a,  114a.  The  government  then  moved \nJudge Bates for a stay of the vacatur pending appeal. \nJudge Bates granted the government’s motion in part, \naligning the vacatur order with relief granted by other \ncourts and maintaining a stable status quo:  DHS did \nnot have to begin accepting initial DACA applications \nor applications for advance parole, but the government \nhad to continue processing DACA renewals. Dkt. 86 at \n2. The government has not sought a stay before the \nD.C. Circuit. \nThe  government’s  opening  brief  was  filed  in  the \nD.C. Circuit on November 26, 2018. Briefing will be \ncomplete in the D.C. Circuit on January 22, 2019. \nOn  November  5,  2018,  the  government  filed  a \npetition for a writ for certiorari before judgment in this \ncase  and  two  others:  Regents  No.  18-587  as  well  as \nNielsen v. Batalla Vidal, No. 18-589. On November 8, \n \n\n10 \n2018, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in the Regents \ncase.  Two  judges  affirmed  the  district  court  in  full, \nholding that the rescission was reviewable and likely \nunlawful. Regents Supp. Pet. App. 5a-78a. One judge \nbelieved that the rescission was not reviewable under \nthe APA, but that the Regents respondents were likely \nto  prevail  on  their  equal  protection  claim.  Regents \nSupp. Pet. App. 79a-87a. \nOn  November  19,  2018,  the  government  filed  a \nsupplemental brief in this Court in the Regents case, \nseeking  to  convert  its  petition  for  certiorari  before \njudgment into a petition for certiorari and arguing that \nthe  Ninth  Circuit  opinion  strengthened  the  case  for \ncertiorari  in  all  three  cases.  The  government  filed  a \nsecond  supplemental  brief  on  November  27,  2018, \ncorrecting its prior supplemental brief and maintaining \nthe  same  position  that  certiorari  before  judgment \nshould be granted in this case.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \nPetitioners  seek  the  extraordinary  action  of  this \nCourt granting certiorari before any court of appeals \nhas  reviewed  a  final  judgment  on  the  questions \npresented—and before this case has been fully briefed \nbefore the D.C. Circuit. Petitioners come nowhere near \nsatisfying  this  Court’s  standards  for  a  grant  of \ncertiorari before judgment, and thus the petition should \nbe denied.  \nI.  Review of the Regents Case Is Premature. \nAs  the  respondents  in  the  Regents  case  explain, \nnotwithstanding  the  issuance  of  the  Ninth  Circuit’s \ndecision, the petition in that case does not meet the \n \n\n11 \nstandard for this Court’s review. That case does not \ninvolve a circuit split. Nor does the petition present an \nimportant  question  of  federal  law  that  should  be \nresolved now.  \nThe first question presented asks only whether the \ndistrict court misapplied the long-settled legal standard \ngoverning when agency action is exempt from judicial \nreview. Applying that standard, all courts that have \nconsidered the matter have concluded that the agency’s \nrescission of DACA is reviewable. \nThe  second  question  presented  addresses  the \nlegality  of  DHS’s  rescission  of  DACA.  While  that \nquestion  may  ultimately  merit  this  Court’s  review, \ngranting certiorari at this stage would short-circuit the \ndevelopment of these issues in the lower courts. “[T]his \nis  exactly  the  sort  of  issue  that  could  benefit  from \nfurther attention in the courts of appeals.” Spears v. \nUnited States, 555 U.S. 261, 270 (2009) (Roberts, C.J., \ndissenting). The D.C. Circuit, in particular, has valuable \nexpertise on questions of administrative law. It, along \nwith the Second and Fourth Circuits, will soon pass on \nboth issues presented by the petition, and the courts of \nappeals will likely issue their decisions on these cases in \n2019. Granting the petitions before those courts have \nruled would unnecessarily deprive the Court of their \nanalysis. \nAdditionally,  the  Ninth  Circuit  addressed  the \nquestions  presented  in  an  interlocutory  posture, \nholding  that  the  Regents  respondents  “are  likely  to \nsucceed in demonstrating that the rescission must be \nset  aside.”  Regents  Supp.  Pet.  App.  57a;  see  also \nRegents Supp. Pet. App. 77a & n.31. This Court reviews \n \n\n12 \nthat determination solely for “abuse of discretion” and \n“uphold[s]  the  injunction”  if  “the  underlying  … \nquestion is close.” Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 664-\n65 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this \nvery  reason,  ordinarily  this  Court  awaits  final \njudgment before granting a petition for review.5 See, \ne.g., Va. Military Institute v. United States, 508 U.S. \n946 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in denial of certiorari); \nAm. Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, Tampa & Key W. Ry. \nCo., 148 U.S. 372, 384 (1893).  \nMoreover,  the  Regents  respondents  present  a \ndistinct equal protection claim that the Ninth Circuit \nfound credible, but which had not been fully developed. \nThat claim was not the basis for the district court’s \nentry of a preliminary injunction. Regents Supp. Pet. \nApp. 84a. Thus, it is not squarely presented for this \nCourt’s review. See Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, 457 \n(1973). As all three Ninth Circuit judges recognized, \nhowever, if presented to the district court, that claim \nmay  result  in  the  entry  of  an  identical  preliminary \ninjunction, should the existing injunction be vacated. \nSee Regents Supp. Pet. App. 77a n.31, 84a-87a.  \nFor these reasons, and those set forth in greater \ndetail  by  the  Regents  respondents,  review  of  the \n                                                 \n5  While  this  Court  granted  United  States  v.  Texas  on  an \ninterlocutory  posture,  circumstances  there  were  materially \ndifferent. DAPA had not yet been implemented, thus there were \nno reliance interests to weigh in the balance of factors. See AR 183 \n(“The interest the government has identified can be effectively \nvindicated after a trial on the merits. The interest the states have \nidentified cannot be, given the difficulty of restoring the status quo \nante if DAPA were to be implemented.”). \n \n\n13 \nquestions presented in that case is premature.  \nII.  The  Petition  for  Certiorari  Before \nJudgment in this Case Should Be Denied. \nEven leaving aside that the district court’s decision \nbelow was correct on the merits, see infra pp. 18-34, the \npetition for certiorari before judgment should be denied \nfor numerous reasons. \nFirst,  this  case  does  not  meet  the  standard  for \nreview before judgment. Sup. Ct. R. 11. It does not \ninvolve exigent circumstances remotely comparable to \nthose at issue in cases where the standard was met, \nsuch as the legality of a military commission at a time of \nwar,  Ex  parte  Quirin,  317  U.S.  1,  20  (1942);  the \nwartime seizure of a steel mill, Youngstown Sheet & \nTube  Co.  v.  Sawyer,  343  U.S.  579,  583-84  (1952);  an \nimpending  deadline  involving  the  breach  of  an \ninternational  treaty,  Dames  &  Moore  v.  Regan,  453 \nU.S.  654,  660  (1981);  or  grand  jury  proceedings \ninvolving the sitting President, United States v. Nixon, \n418  U.S.  683,  686-87  (1974).  Nor  is  there  “disarray \namong the Federal District Courts” that might justify \nthis  Court’s  expedited  review.  Mistretta  v.  United \nStates,  488  U.S.  361,  371  (1989).  Each  case  in  which \ncertiorari before judgment has been granted involved \nemergent  issues  of  national  security  or  issues  that \n“touch fundamentally upon the manner in which our \nRepublic is to be governed.” Dames & Moore, 453 U.S. \nat 659. Even if the questions of administrative law in \nthis case may ultimately be appropriate for the Court’s \nreview, there is no comparable emergency here. Simply \nput, this is not the “extremely rare” case that justifies \n“deviation from normal appellate practice.” Coleman, \n \n\n14 \n424 U.S. at 1304 n.* (Rehnquist, J., in chambers); Sup. \nCt. R. 11.  \nSecond,  the  government’s  own  actions  belie  its \nnewly-minted  claim  of  urgency.  DACA  has  been  in \nplace since 2012. The current administration continued \nthe  program  for  more  than  eight  months  before \ndeciding to discontinue it in response to threats from \ncertain  states.  See  Pet.  App.  8a-9a.  Even  then,  the \nadministration  allowed  some  DACA  recipients  to \nrenew  their  deferred  status,  in  effect  extending  the \nprogram for an additional two and a half years. Because \nthe preliminary injunctions in other cases are limited \nand the vacatur in this case is partially stayed, no new \napplicants  may  receive  deferred  action  under  the \nDACA program. Given this status, the district court in \nthe  Southern  District  of  Texas,  the  court  which \ninvalidated  DAPA,  denied  the  states’  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction against DACA. Texas v. United \nStates, 328 F. Supp. 3d 662, 741-42 (S.D. Tex. 2018). No \nexigency  exists  necessitating  immediate  review  of  a \npolicy that has been in place since 2012 and that the \ngovernment  itself  opted  to  extend  in  part  through \nMarch 2020.  \nThe  administration’s  statements  provide  further \nproof  that  immediate  review  is  unwarranted.  The \nPresident has indicated that it is his “policy” to “allow \nthe dreamers to stay,” Dkt. 28-15 at 1939-40, and senior \nofficials  have  issued  other  statements  in  support  of \nDACA recipients, see, e.g., Dkt. 28-15 at 1922. Contrary \nto  Petitioners’  arguments,  the  President  also  has \nasserted  that  he  “certainly  [has]  the  right”  to  keep \nDACA in place and indicated he “might” decide to do \n \n\n15 \nso. See READ: President Trump’s Full Exchange With \nReporters,  CNN.com  (Jan.  24,  2018),  https://tinyurl.\ncom/ydcafdtr (CNN Statement).  \nThird, the government’s litigation conduct confirms \nthat immediate review is unnecessary. The government \nhas never sought to stay the preliminary injunctions \nissued  in  the  Northern  District  of  California  or  the \nEastern District of New York. Nor did the government \nseek a stay of Judge Bates’ decision to allow portions of \nthe  vacatur  to  take  effect  consistent  with  those \npreliminary injunctions. A stay request would require \nPetitioners  to  demonstrate  irreparable  harm,  and  to \nshow  that  the  balance  of  hardships  favors  a  stay, \nsomething  Petitioners  have  never  attempted  to \narticulate—and  could  not  do,  even  if  they  tried. \nPetitioners’ litigation choices “blunt [the government’s] \nclaim of urgency,” Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 \nU.S. 1315, 1317-18 (1983) (Blackmun, J., in chambers), \nand “vitiate[] much of the force” of its claimed harm, \nBeame  v.  Friends  of  the  Earth,  434  U.S.  1310,  1313 \n(1977) (Marshall, J., in chambers). \nFourth,  the  government  faces  no  concrete  harm \nfrom allowing this case to be decided first by the D.C. \nCircuit.  The  government  suggests  that  review  is \nnecessary because it is being required to retain a policy \nit believes is unlawful. Pet. 14-15. But the government \nneed not grant any new DACA applications. And the \nasserted  harm  with  respect  to  existing  DACA \nrecipients does not warrant premature review: courts \nregularly  maintain  the  status  quo  while  the \ngovernment  litigates  the  extent  of  its  authority  or \nlegality of its conduct. E.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs. v. Dep’t \n \n\n16 \nof  Defense,  138  S.  Ct.  617,  627  (2018)  (noting  the \n“nationwide stay of the [Waters of the United States] \nRule  pending  further  proceedings”);  Gonzalez  v.  O \nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. \n418,  423  (2006)  (affirming  injunction  against \nenforcement of Controlled Substances Act). Indeed, an \nalteration of the status quo pending final judgment is \nthe exception, not the norm. The purported harm of \nmaintaining in place a program that has existed since \n2012, in the face of an attempt at rescission deemed \nunlawful  by  Judge  Bates,  does  not  justify \ncircumventing the normal process for appellate review.  \nThe  alleged  harm  of  permitting  current  DACA \nrecipients to maintain their status while this litigation \nis pending is further discredited by Secretary Nielsen’s \ntestimony  before  Congress  that  DACA  recipients \nwould  not  be  an  enforcement  priority  following \nDACA’s  rescission.6  See  Hearing  on  Kirstjen  M. \nNielsen to be Homeland Security Secretary Before the \nS. Comm. on Homeland Sec. and Gov’t Affairs, 115th \nCong. (2017) (exchange with Senator Harris);  accord \n                                                 \n6  Even  if  DACA  recipients  are  not  likely  to  be  immediately \nremoved,  without  DACA  they  will  lose  their  authorization  to \nwork. As described in detail in Respondents’ submissions to the \ndistrict  court,  the  consequences  for  DACA  recipients  will  be \ndisastrous,  effectively  cutting  short  promising  careers  and \neducational programs and terminating DACA recipients’ ability to \nsupport  themselves  and  their  families.  See  Dkts.  28-8,  28-17; \nRegents Pet. App. 62a-66a (recognizing catastrophic consequences \nof  rescission  and  concluding  that  consequences  for  DACA \nrecipients  and  other  affected  parties  outweigh  government’s \nasserted interest in initiating wind-down); Batalla Vidal Pet. App. \n123a-126a (same). \n \n\n17 \nHearing on Oversight of the United States Department \nof  Homeland  Security  Before  the  S.  Comm.  on  the \nJudiciary, 115th Cong. (2018) (exchange with Senator \nHarris). Moreover, the district court’s order does not \ncompel  the  government  to  “sanction”  the  unlawful \npresence of anyone. Under DACA’s plain terms, each \nrenewal  application  is  evaluated  “on  a  case  by  case \nbasis,” AR 2, and DHS can initiate removal proceedings \nagainst DACA recipients determined to present a risk \nto national security or public safety. AR 1-3; see also \nRegents  Pet.  App.  45a.  As  Judge  Bates  noted,  this \nlitigation  “does  not  itself  delay  the  removal  of  any \nspecific alien.” Pet. App. 38a.  \nFifth, for similar reasons, the continuation of DACA \ncauses no harm to the public. DACA recipients were \nsubjected  to  rigorous  background  checks  and  heavy \nscrutiny  to  ensure  they  did  not  pose  a  “threat  to \nnational  security  or  public  safety,”  had  not  “been \nconvicted  of  certain  criminal  offenses,”  and  fulfilled \neducational  and  work-related  criteria.  Pet.  App.  4a. \nUnder  the  terms  of  the  DACA  program  itself,  the \ngovernment  can  terminate  deferred  action  if,  for \nexample,  a  DACA  recipient  is  convicted  of  a \ndisqualifying crime. Sensibly, the government does not \neven  contend  that  the  public  might  somehow  be \nharmed  by  the  continued  lawful  presence  of  DACA \nrecipients during this litigation. \nSixth,  the  government  is  incorrect  that  the \npendency  of  this  litigation  may  stymie  legislative \nresolutions  to  these  issues.  Pet.  at  15.  As  the \ngovernment  concedes,  the  challenge  of  achieving \nlegislative  compromise  long  predates  this  litigation. \n \n\n18 \nPet. at 4, 15. And with a new Congress set to convene, \nthere is a renewed possibility of a legislative solution. \nCongressional  action  could  render  the  matter  moot. \nThis  possibility  counsels  against  premature \nconsideration  by  this  Court.  See,  e.g.,  Volpe  v.  D.C. \nFed’n  of  Civic  Ass’ns,  405  U.S.  1030,  1030  (1972) \n(Burger, C.J., concurring in denial of certiorari).  \nFinally,  denying  certiorari  will  not  preclude \nconsideration  of  the  questions  presented.  The \ngovernment’s  demand  that  the  Court  abandon  the \nordinary,  time-tested  appellate  process  is  simply  a \nmeans to rush the case to the Court this Term—all in a \ncontext where the government has never identified any \nconcrete harms caused by addressing this case in the \nnormal  course.  It  is  virtually  certain  that  the  D.C. \nCircuit  will  issue  a  decision  in  plenty  of  time  for  a \npetition  to  be  considered  next  Term.  See  Aaron  v. \nCooper,  357  U.S.  566,  566-67  (1958)  (per  curiam) \n(denying petition for certiorari before judgment). If the \nCourt believes the questions merit review at that time, \nit will have the benefit of additional circuit opinions. It \nwill  also  have  the  option  of  deciding  these  issues \nthrough a vehicle that is not interlocutory.  \nIII.  The District Court’s Decision Is Correct.  \nThe  Court  should  also  deny  certiorari  because \nJudge Bates’ decision is correct on the merits. \nA.   The  Rescission  of  DACA  Is  Subject  to \nJudicial Review.  \nAs  every  court  to  consider  the  first  question \npresented  has  agreed,  DACA’s  rescission  is  neither \n“committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law,”  5  U.S.C. \n \n\n19 \n§ 701(a)(2),  nor  an  action  “to  commence  proceedings, \nadjudicate  cases,  or  executive  removal  orders,”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(g). See Pet. App. 25a-43a; Regents Pet. \nApp. 26a-30a; Batalla Vidal Pet. App. at 25a-31a; see \nalso Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Homeland Sec., 284 F. \nSupp. 3d 758, 770 (D. Md. 2018), appeal docketed, No. \n18-1522 (4th Cir. May 8, 2018). \n1. There is a “strong presumption favoring judicial \nreview of administrative action,” that the government \n“bears a heavy burden” to overcome. Mach Mining, 135 \nS. Ct. at 1651 (internal quotation marks omitted); see \nalso Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., \n139 S. Ct. 361, 369-70 (2018) (slip op. at 11). Section \n701(a)(2)  offers  a  “very  narrow  exception”  to  that \nstrong presumption, triggered only when “in a given \ncase  there  is  no  law  to  apply.”  Citizens  to  Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), \nabrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 \nU.S. 99 (1977). That is not the case here.  \na. The government’s lead argument is that “Section \n701(a)(2) precludes review of an agency’s decision not \nto  institute  enforcement  actions”  under  Heckler  v. \nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). Regents Pet. 18. But \nthe government does not even contend that DACA’s \nrescission is such a decision; rather, it seeks to expand \nChaney  to  make  unreviewable  all  agency  decisions \nabout whether and how to enforce federal statutes—no \nmatter the scope and formality of the agency’s decision, \nno matter whether the decision reflects an erroneous \nview  of  the  agency’s  legal  authority,  and  no  matter \nwhether  the  agency  action  at  issue  is  a  non-\nenforcement decision at all. Such an expansion—which \n(cid:3)\n\n20 \nwould encourage politically unaccountable agencies to \nmake  policy  in  the  guise  of  unreviewable  legal \ndeterminations—is unwarranted, unwise, and without \nbasis in law. \nIn  Chaney,  death-row  inmates  filed  a  petition \nasking the FDA to initiate enforcement proceedings to \nstop  two  states  from  using  certain  drugs  in  their \nexecutions. See 470 U.S. at 823-24. The FDA responded \nby  letter,  explaining  that  the  agency’s  enforcement \nauthority in the area was “generally unclear” and that, \nin any event, the agency had decided that the particular \nfacts  alleged  did  not  meet  the  agency’s  criteria  for \ninitiating enforcement. See id. at 824-25. The inmates \nsought judicial review, arguing that the FDA did have \nauthority  to  act  and  that  it  had  misapplied  its  own \nenforcement criteria. Id. at 825-26.  \nThis Court held that “an agency’s decision not to \ntake enforcement action should be presumed immune \nfrom  judicial  review.”  Id.  at  832.  But  the  Court’s \ndecision was limited in two critical respects. First, the \nCourt was careful to note that “[w]e do not have in this \ncase a refusal by the agency to institute proceedings \nbased solely on the belief that it lacks jurisdiction.” Id. \nat  833  n.4.  In  such  a  case,  “the  statute  conferring \nauthority on the agency” might suffice to indicate that \nthe  agency’s  decision  to  tie  its  own  hands  was  not \n“committed  to  agency  discretion.”  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Second, the Court addressed \nonly  an  agency’s  refusal  to  undertake  a  “particular \nenforcement action” in a given instance. Id. at 831. The \nCourt referred throughout its opinion to an individual \n“refusal to institute proceedings,” which it analogized \n \n\n21 \nto an individual prosecutor’s decision “not to indict” a \ngiven offender. Id. at 832; see id. at 827-38. \ni.  The  government  seeks  to  expand  Chaney’s \nnarrow presumption of unreviewability from individual \nnon-enforcement  decisions  to  “broad  enforcement \npolic[ies].” Regents Pet. 20 (quotation marks omitted). \nBut  Chaney  does  not  apply  to  general  enforcement \npolicies at all. This Court has previously declined to \nextend  Chaney  to  decisions  not  to  institute  a \nrulemaking. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, \n527 (2007). The Court noted as “key differences” the \nfact that “agency refusals to initiate rulemaking ‘are \nless frequent, more apt to involve legal as opposed to \nfactual  analysis,  and  subject  to  special  formalities, \nincluding a public explanation.’” Id. (quoting Am. Horse \nProtection  Ass’n  v.  Lyng,  812  F.2d  1,  4  (D.C.  Cir. \n1987)).  There  are  similar  “ample  reasons  for \ndistinguishing”  between  broad  enforcement  policies \nand  “single-shot”  nonenforcement  decisions  like  in \nChaney. See Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, \n37 F.3d 671, 676-77 (D.C. Cir. 1994).7   \nTo be clear, Respondents do not suggest that all \nchallenges  to  broad  enforcement  policies  are \nnecessarily amenable to review, but simply that they \nare, as a class, outside Chaney’s narrow reversal of the \npresumption of reviewability. In some cases, there may \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n7  For  similar  reasons,  the  lump  sum  appropriation  held \nunreviewable  in  Lincoln  v.  Vigil,  508  U.S.  182  (1993),  is \ndistinguishable from a broad enforcement policy. Like a single-\nshot enforcement decision, the decision not to fund a program for \nhandicapped Indian children in the Southwest is not as amenable \nto judicial review as a broad enforcement policy. Id. at 192-93.\n(cid:3)\n\n22 \nbe no “law to apply.” See infra pp. 24-26. And in many \ncases,  review  of  agency  policies  will  be  highly \ndeferential. See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 527 (holding \nthat review of a refusal to initiate rulemaking should be \ndeferential). But broad discretion is not the same as \nunreviewable discretion, and neither Chaney nor any of \nthis  Court’s  other  cases  suggest  that  a  general \nenforcement  policy  is  presumptively  immune  from \nreview under the APA.  \nii.  At  a  minimum,  a  general  enforcement  policy \npredicated  on  a  misconception  of  an  agency’s  legal \nauthority  is  presumptively  reviewable.  Agency \ninterpretations  of  law,  by  definition,  are  not \n“committed to agency discretion,” as it is ultimately the \nrole of the courts to determine what the law is. DACA’s \nrescission was predicated entirely—or, at a minimum, \noverwhelmingly—on a legal judgment about the scope \nof the Secretary’s authority. Supra p. 7. The district \ncourt  held  that  “Chaney’s  presumption  of \nunreviewability” did not apply “to a legal interpretation \nphrased as a general enforcement policy,” including an \ninterpretation that “concerns the scope of the agency’s \nlawful  enforcement  authority.”  Pet.  App.  39a.  This \nholding is correct. \nAn agency action premised on the belief that it is \ncompelled  by  law  does  not  involve  “a  complicated \nbalancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly \nwithin [the agency’s] expertise.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at \n831.  Indeed,  the  premise  of  Petitioners’  rescission  is \nthat they lacked discretion to maintain DACA, so there \nwere  no  factors  to  balance.  And  for  that  reason,  no \nlegitimate interest is served by insulating the agency’s \n \n\n23 \nlegal  judgment  from  review.  Barring  review  of  an \nagency  policy  based  on  the  value  of  “enforcement \ndiscretion” is nonsensical when the very legal error at \nissue is the agency’s too-narrow definition of its own \nenforcement discretion. As the district court put it, “an \nofficial cannot claim that the law ties her hands while at \nthe  same  time  denying  the  courts’  power  to  unbind \nher.”  Pet. App. 73a. \nThis rule also draws powerful support from the core \npurposes of the APA. If an agency’s narrow assessment \nof  its  legal  authority  were  immune  from  review,  an \nagency could avoid political accountability for a major \npolicy choice by insisting that the law forced its hand—\njust as the government has repeatedly claimed here—\nwhile also evading any review of the legal judgment  As \nthe  district  court  underscored,  approving  that  result \nwould thwart the APA’s commitment to ensuring that \nagencies  are  subject  to  meaningful  checks—“in  the \ncourt of public opinion” or, if not, in a court of law. Pet. \nApp.  72a-73a.  ICC  v.  Brotherhood  of  Locomotive \nEngineers, 482 U.S. 270 (1987), is not to the contrary. \nThere,  the  denial  of  a  petition  to  reconsider  certain \nlabor  conditions  was  exactly  the  sort  of  single-shot \ndecision  not  to  act  that  was  held  unreviewable  in \nChaney. Id. at 282. And the agency did not contend it \nwas without authority to act—it simply did not believe \nthe petition had merit. The Court’s statement that an \nagency  action  is  not  reviewable  simply  where  “the \nagency  gives  a  ‘reviewable’  reason  for  otherwise \nunreviewable  action,”  id.  at  283,  is  beside  the  point \nwhere, as here, the agency action is reviewable. \niii. Chaney is also inapposite because the rescission \n \n\n24 \nof DACA is not “an agency’s refusal to take requested \nenforcement action.”  470 U.S. at 831 (emphasis added). \nRather,  the  agency  has  affirmatively  terminated  a \nsignificant program that provided a form of protection \nagainst removal to hundreds of thousands of people and \noffered  them  the  opportunity  to  work,  go  to  school, \nobtain driver’s licenses, and seek other benefits. Supra \np.  4.  Indeed,  Chaney  expressly  distinguished  non-\nenforcement  decisions  from  affirmative  government \nactions: \n[W]hen an agency refuses to act it generally does \nnot  exercise  its  coercive  power  over  an \nindividual’s liberty or property rights, and thus \ndoes not infringe upon areas that courts often \nare called upon to protect. Similarly, when an \nagency  does  act  to  enforce,  that  action  itself \nprovides a focus for judicial review, inasmuch as \nthe  agency  must  have  exercised  its  power  in \nsome manner. \n470 U.S. at 832 (emphasis in original).  \nTermination  of  a  substantial  program  providing \naccess to important benefits undoubtedly addresses an \n“area  that  courts  often  are  called  upon  to  protect.” \nBecause Chaney does not apply to affirmative actions \nof  that  sort,  DACA’s  rescission  is  subject  to  the \nordinary  presumption  of  reviewability,  and  the \ngovernment bears the burden to show that there is “no \nlaw to apply.” \nb.  There  are  judicially  manageable  standards  to \napply  in  resolving  Respondents’  claims,  and  the \ngovernment makes little effort to contend otherwise. \n \n\n25 \nFirst,  the  basis  for  the  agency’s  decision  was  a \ndetermination that DHS lacks the statutory authority \nto continue DACA. That is a purely legal judgment, \nand, of course, legal standards exist to resolve legal \nquestions.  See  Int’l  Union,  UAW  v.  Brock, 783  F.2d \n237,  246  (D.C.  Cir.  1986)  (noting  that  it  is  “almost \nludicrous to suggest that there is ‘no law to apply’ in \nreviewing  whether  an  agency  has  reasonably \ninterpreted a law”).  \nSecond, in many cases, this Court has invalidated \nagency action because it failed to “cogently explain why \nit  has  exercised  its  discretion  in  a  given  manner.”  \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \nMut.  Auto.  Ins.  Co.,  463  U.S.  29,  48-49  (1983).  In \nJudulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42 (2011), for example, \nthe  Court  unanimously  rejected  the  government’s \npolicy  for  determining  eligibility  for  discretionary \nimmigration  relief  as  arbitrary  and  capricious, \nexplaining that the agency’s chosen approach was not \n“tied,  even  …  loosely,  to  the  purposes  of  the \nimmigration laws or the appropriate operation of the \nimmigration system.” Id. at 55. Because the agency did \nnot “exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner,” its \npolicy could not “pass muster under ordinary principles \nof administrative law.” Id. at 53, 64. The Court had no \ndifficulty  making  that  judgment,  even  without  a \nstatutory definition of the “appropriate operation of the \nimmigration  system,”  because  the  agency’s  rationale \nfailed on its own terms. Id. at 55. The district court \nundertook the equivalent inquiry in this case, ruling not \nbased  on  the  wisdom  of  the  particular  immigration \npolicy at issue, but on the irrationality of the agency’s \n \n\n26 \ndecisionmaking and the lack of explanation. Pet. App. \n48a-60a. \n2. The government also argues that 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear this \ncase. Section 1252(g) states that “[e]xcept as provided \nin this section [i.e., through the removal process] … no \ncourt shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim \nby or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or \naction by the Attorney General to commence \nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal \norders against any alien under [the INA].”  That \nprovision does not apply here. \nAs the district court explained, the government’s \nargument “contradicts not only the plain language of \n§ 1252(g) but also the Court’s interpretation of that \nlanguage  in  Reno  v.  American–Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee (“AAADC”), where the \nCourt specifically rejected the argument that ‘the \nmention of three discrete events along the road to \ndeportation was a shorthand way of referring to all \nclaims arising from deportation proceedings.’” Pet. \nApp. 20a (quoting AAADC, 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999)). \nAs this Court explained, § 1252(g) applies “only to \nthree discrete actions that the Attorney General may \ntake: her ‘decision or action’ to ‘commence proceedings, \nadjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’” Id. \n(quoting 525 U.S. at 482). By contrast, it does not apply \nto other “part[s] of the deportation process,” such as \n“decisions to open an investigation, to surveil the \nsuspected violator, to reschedule the deportation \nhearing, to include various provisions in the final order \nthat is the product of the adjudication, and to refuse \n \n\n27 \nreconsideration of that order.” Id. (quoting 525 U.S. at \n482). Here, as the district court explained, “there are no \npending  removal  proceedings  with  which  plaintiffs’ \nchallenge  might  interfere.”  Pet.  App.  21a.8  \nAccordingly,  § 1252(g)  does  not  bar  review  of \nRespondents’ claims. \nB.   The District Court Correctly Held that the \nRescission  of  DACA  Was  Arbitrary  and \nCapricious. \n1.  The  district  court  held  that  DHS  failed  to \n“examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its action including a rational connection \nbetween  the  facts  found  and  the  choice  made.”  Pet. \nApp. 48a. (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n136 S. Ct. 2117, 2127 (2016)); see also Pet. App. 59a-60a. \nThat narrow holding, which does not rest on DACA’s \nlegality, is well grounded in this Court’s APA decisions. \nFirst, the district court found the agency’s “scant \nlegal  reasoning”  contrary  to  this  Court’s  clear \narticulation  in  Encino  Motorcars  of  what  the  APA \nrequires. Pet. App. 49a-51a. The agency’s assertion that \nDACA  violated  the  INA  was  “based  only  on  an \nincongruous reference to the Fifth Circuit’s decision on \nDAPA,” Pet. App. 52a, while its “analysis of DACA’s \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n8 In  addition,  § 1252(g)  could  not  bar  the  claims  brought  by \nRespondents Microsoft and Princeton, neither of whom is an alien \nor suing solely “on behalf of” an alien. Rather, each has alleged \nthat the rescission of DACA will hamper its own operations—in \nPrinceton’s  case  as  a  university,  in  Microsoft’s  case  as  a \ncorporation. See Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 61, 62; see also Batalla Vidal Pet. App. \n38a-39a. \n(cid:3)\n\n28 \nconstitutionality  was  so  barebones  that  the  Court \ncannot ‘discern[]’ the ‘path’ that the agency followed,” \nPet. App. 53a-54a (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. \nCt.  at  2125).  Those  failures  were  “particularly \negregious  here  in  light  of  the  reliance  interests \ninvolved.”  Pet. App. 54a (citing Encino Motorcars, 136 \nS. Ct. at 2126); see also id. (“DACA had been in place \nfor  five  years  and  had  engendered  the  reliance  of \nhundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, many of whom \nhad structured their education, employment, and other \nlife activities on the assumption that they would be able \nto  renew  their  DACA  benefits.”).  The  district  court \nnoted that this Court “has set aside changes in agency \npolicy for failure to consider reliance interests that pale \nin comparison to the ones at stake here.” Pet. App. 54a-\n55a (citing, e.g., Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126).9   \nSecond,  the  district  court  correctly  found \ninadequate  the  government’s  explanation  for  its \n“litigation risk” basis to rescind DACA. Pet. App. 55a-\n59a. In the district court, the government argued that if \nDACA were challenged in litigation brought by Texas, \n“the  district  court  there  would  enter  a  ‘nationwide \ninjunction’ that ‘would have prompted an immediate—\nand chaotic—end to the policy.’” Pet. App. 55a (quoting \nDefs.’  Reply  at  15).  The  district  court  appropriately \n                                                 \n9 The government suggests that it did consider these interests in \nthat it allowed DACA recipients to maintain their status until it \nexpired.  Regents  Pet.  26-27.  But  the  Duke  Memo  belies  that \nargument:  It does not so much as mention the interests of DACA \nrecipients, instead linking the choice to “wind [DACA] down in an \nefficient and orderly fashion” to the “administrative complexities” \nfor the agency in ending the program. AR 254.  \n \n\n29 \nheld  this  rationale  “so  implausible  that  it  fails  even \nunder  the  deferential  arbitrary  and  capricious \nstandard.”  Pet.  App.  60a.  In  light  of  the  discretion \navailable  to  a  district  court  in  Texas,  “it  strains \ncredulity”  that  such  a  court  “would  have  enjoined \nDACA  immediately  and  completely  without  allowing \nDHS any opportunity to wind the program down.”10  \nPet.  App.  58a.  Because  the  agency  failed  even  to \nacknowledge the range of options available to a district \ncourt, much less analyze and weigh them against the \nbenefits of maintaining the DACA program, the court \nfound this rationale arbitrary and capricious. Pet. App. \n58a-59a.11     \n2. Relying on the Nielsen Memo, the government \nseeks to morph its rationale for rescinding DACA into \nan argument that it did so based on “serious doubts” \nabout  DACA’s  legality.  To  the  extent  that  rationale \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n10 As expected, the Southern District of Texas denied Texas’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction. Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d at 741-\n42.\n11 For  the  exact  reasons  given  by  the  district  court,  amici’s \nargument that “threatened litigation” alone provided a “valid basis \nfor  ending  DACA,”—even  absent  any  analysis  of  the  likely \noutcome of the litigation or of the costs of rescinding DACA—is \nbaseless.  Texas,  Amicus  Br.  at  10.  Moreover,  Respondents \nidentified additional failures of explanation, but the district court \ndid not reach them in light of its central ruling that the rationales \nprovided for rescission were themselves inadequate. Nevertheless, \nDACA’s  rescission  could  equally  be  invalidated  for  failing  to \nconsider alternatives, such as enhancements to the individualized \nreview of DACA applications, or failing to explain the reasoning \nunderlying the agency’s idiosyncratic and haphazard “wind-down” \nprocess. See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50-51.\n(cid:3)\n\n30 \ndiffers  in  substance  from  the  rationale  in  the  Duke \nMemo,  it  may  not  be  used  to  justify,  retroactively, \nActing Secretary Duke’s rescission of DACA. And, in \nany event, it too fails arbitrary and capricious review. \na. The Duke Memo articulates only one independent \nrationale for DACA’s rescission: the claim that DACA \nis illegal. Both Attorney General Sessions’ letter and \nthe Duke Memo are framed in purely legal terms. AR \n251-256.  Indeed,  after  declaring  DACA \n“unconstitutional”  and  lacking  in  “proper  statutory \nauthority,”  Attorney  General  Sessions  invoked  the \n“duty to defend the Constitution and faithfully execute \nthe  laws  passed  by  Congress”  and  touted  the \n“restoration of the rule of law” that DACA’s rescission \nwould purportedly bring about. AR 251. In this context, \nthe Attorney General’s passing assertion that a court \nwould “likely” agree with him about DACA, AR 251, \ncannot plausibly be viewed as a freestanding basis for \nrescission. And the Duke Memo that followed the next \nday  added  nothing  of  substance  to  the  Attorney \nGeneral’s analysis, and certainly nothing resembling a \npolicy assessment.  \nThe new justifications for the rescission of DACA \ncontained  in  the  Nielsen  Memo  cannot  retroactively \nbolster the prior decision. Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, \n460 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing Overton Park, 401 \nU.S. at 420).12  As the district court put it, there is a \n                                                 \n12 As the district court observed: “[H]ad Secretary Nielsen opted \nto issue a new decision rescinding DACA, the explanations offered \nin her memorandum would be contemporaneous and, consequently, \nnot post hoc. She did not do this, however.”  Pet. App. 94a n.7. \nMoreover,  if  Secretary  Nielsen  had  taken  a  separate \n \n\n31 \ncritical distinction between “an ‘amplified articulation’ \nof  the  agency’s  prior  reasoning  (which  must  be \nconsidered),” and “‘a new reason for why the agency \ncould  have’  taken  the  action  (which  must  be \ndisregarded).” Pet. App. 92a (citations omitted).  \nCamp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138 (1973), is instructive. \nThere, an agency declined to approve a bank charter, \nand  the  court  of  appeals  held  that  the  agency’s \nexplanation for that decision was deficient. This Court \nheld that under Overton Park, the court could obtain \n“such  additional  explanation  of  the  reasons  for  the \nagency decision as may prove necessary.”  411 U.S. at \n143.  But  the  Court  stressed  a  “caveat”:  “Unlike \nOverton  Park,  in  the  present  case  there  was \ncontemporaneous explanation of the agency decision” \nto deny the bank charter; and while that explanation \n“may  have  been  curt,”  it  “surely  indicated  the \ndeterminative reason for the final action taken.”  Id. \nAccordingly, the Court said, the validity of the agency’s \naction “must … stand or fall on the propriety of that \nfinding.”  Id.  If  the  pivotal  finding  could  not  be \nsustained even with the benefit of further explanation \nfrom the relevant personnel, the agency would need to \nmake a fresh decision on remand. Id. (citing SEC v. \nChenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80 (1943)); see also Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 654 \n(1990)  (reaffirming  that  Overton  Park  authorizes  “a \nremand to the agency for a fuller explanation of the \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\nadministrative action, Respondents would be entitled to review \nthe administrative record to assess whether Secretary Nielsen \nweighed all of the relevant interests, “look[ing] at the costs as well \nas the benefits.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52, 54.\n(cid:3)\n\n32 \nagency’s reasoning at the time of the agency action” \n(emphasis added)); Pet. App. 82a. \nThus, while the Nielsen Memo’s legal analysis may \nbe considered, its other arguments—and certainly its \n“policy” arguments, to the extent they exist—may not \nbe used to uphold the rescission.  \nb. Even if a court could consider the Nielsen Memo’s \n“serious  doubts  about  DACA’s  legality,”  that \njustification is arbitrary and capricious.  \nFirst,  the  Nielsen  Memo  no  more  explains  its \n“doubts”  about  DACA’s  legality  than  did  the  Duke \nMemo explain its conclusion. Pet. App. 106a. Secretary \nNielsen  asserts  that  DACA  “was  contrary  to  law” \nwithout  specifying  which  law,13  saying  only  that  the \nFifth  Circuit’s  DAPA  decision  turned  on  the \n“incompatibility of such a major non-enforcement policy \nwith the INA’s comprehensive scheme.” Regents Pet. \nApp.  122a.  But  she  does  not  articulate  when  a  non-\nenforcement policy becomes sufficiently “major” that it \nis incompatible with the INA. For example, Secretary \nNielsen does not say which of the myriad past deferred \naction programs would pass muster under this novel, \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n13  To  the  extent  the  government  contends  that  DACA  was \nimproper because it would have required notice and comment, that \nitself would not be sufficient to uphold the rescission because the \ngovernment would have needed notice and comment to undo the \nprogram. See Consumer Energy Council of Am. v. FERC, 673 \nF.2d 425, 446 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[T]he APA expressly contemplates \nthat notice and an opportunity to comment will be provided prior \nto agency decisions to repeal a rule.”), aff’d sub nom. Process Gas \nConsumers Grp. v. Consumer Energy Council of Am., 463 U.S. \n1216 (1983).\n(cid:3)\n\n33 \nbarely-articulated standard. Dkt. 28-16 at 2158-60. And \neven though her analysis appears to turn on whether a \nnon-enforcement  policy  is  sufficiently  “major,” \nSecretary  Nielsen  does  not  address  the  significant \ndifferences between DACA and DAPA as to scope and \nsize: both that DAPA, unlike DACA, was an “open-\nended” policy “with no established end-date,” AR 251, \nand that there were almost four persons eligible for \nDAPA  for  each  person  eligible  for  DACA.  Even \ncombining the efforts of the Duke and Nielsen Memos, \nit  remains  true  that  “[w]hatever  potential  reasons \n[Defendants]  might  have  given,  [they]  in  fact  gave \nalmost no reasons at all.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. \nNavarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2127 (2016).\nThe Nielsen Memo’s discussion of reliance interests \nalso remains inadequate. Secretary Nielsen notes her \nawareness  “that  DACA  recipients  have  availed \nthemselves of the policy” and states that the “asserted \nreliance interests” do not “outweigh the questionable \nlegality of the DACA policy and [the] other reasons for \nending the policy discussed above.” Regents Pet. App. \n125a. But acknowledging that DACA has existed is not \nthe  same  thing  as  weighing  the  real  effects  of  its \nrescission.  Thus,  like  the  Duke  Memo,  the  Nielsen \nMemo “entirely failed to consider an important aspect \nof the problem.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nSecond, even if Secretary Nielsen had provided an \nadequate explanation, it would be incorrect. DACA is a \nlawful exercise of DHS’s broad statutory authority to \n“[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement policies \nand priorities,” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5), and to carry out the \n“administration and enforcement of [the INA] and all \n(cid:3)\n\n34 \nother  laws  relating  to  the  immigration  and \nnaturalization of aliens,” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), including \nby  providing  for  work  authorization,  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1324a(h)(2). As the United States itself has previously \nargued, the government has long used deferred action \nto effectuate its enforcement priorities. See Dkt. 28-16 \nat 2152-74.14 Because the government is incorrect about \nDACA’s legality, rescission based on that rationale is \narbitrary and capricious. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 \nU.S. 80, 94 (1943) (“[A]n order may not stand if the \nagency has misconceived the law.”). \nAccordingly, Secretary Duke’s rescission of DACA \nremains arbitrary and capricious and cannot be saved \nby  the  Nielsen  Memo.  Because  the  district  court’s \nnarrow  and  well-reasoned  decision  is  correct,  the \npetition should be denied. \n \n                                                 \n14 In arguing that DACA is illegal, amici entirely ignore not only \nthe well-established history of deferred action programs, but also \nthe 2014 OLC Memorandum explicitly determining that DACA \nwas a lawful exercise of executive discretion. See Texas, Amicus \nBr. 12. But failing to acknowledge evidence contrary to its position \ndoes not render that evidence invalid. \n \n\n35 \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment \nshould be denied. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nJOSEPH M.

The  administration  is  correct: \nDACA  affirmatively  confers  “lawful  presence”  status \nand work-authorization eligibility on over half a million \naliens. DACA is thus materially identical to two pro-\ngrams (Expanded DACA and DAPA) that were invali-\ndated by the Fifth Circuit in a ruling affirmed by an \nequally divided vote of this Court. See Texas v. United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134, 172, 184-86 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by \nan equally divided court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per cu-\nriam) (Texas I). DACA is procedurally and substantive-\nly unlawful for much of the same reasons this Court af-\nfirmed in that case. \nTexas led the group of States successfully challeng-\ning Expanded DACA and DAPA. Texas then led the \ngroup of States notifying the federal government that \nthey  would  challenge  DACA  on  the  same  grounds  if \n                                            \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed mone-\ntarily to its preparation or submission. The parties received \ntimely notice of filing, and consents have been provided to \namici. See Sup. Ct. R. 37. \n \n(1) \n\n2 \n \nDACA was not wound down. A.R. 238-40.2 It was be-\ncause of the Executive’s September 2017 DACA-wind-\ndown memorandum that Texas and other States agreed \nto dismiss their pending lawsuit. Pls.’ Stip. of Voluntary \nDismissal  at  1,  Texas  v.  United  States,  No.  1:14-cv-\n00254 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 12, 2017), ECF No. 473. And be-\ncause DACA’s rescission was enjoined, the Amici States \nultimately filed suit seeking a declaration that DACA \nwas unlawful. Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662 (S.D. Tex. 2018) (Texas II). \nThe petition thus directly implicates the States’ ef-\nforts to bring about an orderly end to DACA. \n                                            \n2 A.R. cites the Administrative Record, filed as Notice of Fil-\ning Administrative Record, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 3:17-cv-05211 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, \n2017), ECF No. 64-1. \n\n3 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.A.  When  a  new  presidential  administration  de-\ncides  to  change—or  even  reverse—the  discretionary \npolicies of the previous one, its decision is not subject to \nany special scrutiny beyond that set out in the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA forbids the ad-\nministration from acting in an arbitrary and capricious \nmanner. That remains true both for the implementation \nof new policies and the rescission of old policies. The \ndecision to terminate the previous administration’s poli-\ncy must meet that standard—and no other. \nB. The plaintiffs in these three cases join a litany of \nlitigants around the nation who seek to upend that prin-\nciple. They argue that rescinding DACA was not law-\nful—and the Ninth Circuit has agreed. Regents of the \nUniv. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d \n476, 510 (9th Cir. 2018). But that argument seeks to im-\npose on the administration a burden the APA does not. \nThe Executive does not act arbitrarily or capriciously \nby rescinding a prior administration’s policy that is not \nrequired  by  law  and  that  the  Executive  concludes  is \nsubstantively unlawful.  \nThat is especially so here. The Executive decided to \nwind  down  DACA  after  a  new  administration  reex-\namined its lawfulness and concluded that DACA would \nlikely be held unlawful. Pet. App. 114a-18a.3 Nothing in \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or any oth-\n                                            \n3 Pet. App. cites the Appendix to the Petition for a Writ of \nCertiorari Before Judgment in U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. \nv. Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. 18-587 (S. Ct. filed Nov. 5, \n2018). \n\n4 \n \ner federal law requires DACA, so its cancellation con-\ntravenes  no  law.  Moreover,  in  response  to  a  lawsuit \nbrought by Texas and a coalition of States, one district \ncourt already has concluded that DACA is likely unlaw-\nful as both a substantive and procedural matter. Under \nthese circumstances, the Executive’s decision satisfies \nAPA review. \nThis  case  thus  presents  an  opportunity  for  the \nCourt  to  clarify  that  the  cancellation  of  DACA,  like \nmany  other  discretionary  policy  decisions,  does  not \nmerit some special scrutiny beyond that set out in the \nAPA. Applying the correct scrutiny, the plaintiffs’ chal-\nlenge fails. \nII.A. The Executive’s decision to wind down DACA \nis  especially  justified because  DACA  is  substantively \nand procedurally unlawful. DACA is unlawful for the \nsame reasons that Expanded DACA and DAPA were \nheld unlawful in the previous Texas I litigation. See 809 \nF.3d at 172, 184-86. It is substantively flawed because it \ngoes further than mere “prosecutorial discretion” not to \ndeport individuals. DACA confers legal status on indi-\nviduals, contravening congressional authority to make \nsuch determinations. \nB. DACA is also procedurally unlawful. The plead-\nings in the DACA-rescission litigation confirm that it \naltered substantive rights, yet was issued without APA \nnotice and comment. The Executive cannot be ordered \nto maintain such an unlawful program. Thus, even on \nplaintiffs’  view  of  notice-and-comment  requirements, \ninjunctions  forcing  the  Executive  Branch  to  continue \nwith DACA cannot be justified. \nIII. The Court should grant certiorari and reverse \nall orders enjoining the Executive from winding down \n\n5 \n \nDACA. Although the Ninth Circuit ruled in Regents of \nthe University of California after petitioners filed their \npetition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, 908 \nF.3d 476, amici agree that granting certiorari in that \ncase is appropriate, Supp. Pet. Br. 9-10. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s ruling strengthens the case for granting certiorari \nbefore judgment in Trump v. National Ass’n for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, No. 18-588 (filed Nov. \n5, 2018), and Nielsen v. Batalla Vidal, No. 18-589 (filed \nNov. 5, 2018), and consolidating the cases for considera-\ntion this Term. Only this Court can provide definitive \nresolution to the dispute over DACA’s rescission.  \nImmediate review is especially warranted here be-\ncause of the ongoing irreparable harm that DACA in-\nflicts on the States. “[B]ecause DACA increases the to-\ntal number of aliens in the States by disincentivizing \nthose  already  present  from  leaving,  the  States  must \nprovide more . . . social services, which cost more.” Tex-\nas II, 328 F. Supp. 3d at 700. And DACA “allow[s] its \nrecipients  to  compete  with  legally  present  residents” \nfor jobs. Id.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Review  Is  Needed  to  Correct  a  Fundamental \nMisunderstanding of APA review. \nA.  A new administration’s decision to reverse its \npredecessor’s discretionary policies does not \nmerit special scrutiny. \nThe arguments against DACA’s rescission reflect \nplaintiffs’  fundamental  misunderstanding  of  APA  re-\nview. Under their view, a court may rely on policy dif-\nferences  and  supposed  reliance  interests  to  second-\nguess an agency determination that seeks to change a \n\n6 \n \npolicy  from  a  prior  administration.  And  all  this even \nthough the agency acts in the same manner to amend \nthe policy as the agency did to enact it in the first in-\nstance. \nThat is not the law. New presidential administra-\ntions bring changes in policy and agency priorities. So \nlong as an agency acts within its realm of authority, its \ndecision  to  alter  a  policy  determination—or  even  re-\nverse course—is not subject to an enhanced standard of \nreview. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 513 (2009); Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. \nEPA, 682 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (describ-\ning  the  argument  that  agency  reversal  is  subject  to \nmore searching review as “largely foreclosed” by Fox \nTelevision Stations). This flows from the APA’s narrow \nscope of review that limits the judicial inquiry. Fox Tel-\nevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 514. Critically, courts \nmust not impose substantive judgments on the contest-\ned issue and review those policy shifts only for fidelity \nto APA procedures—even when reliance interests are \nat issue. Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. \n1199, 1207 (2015). \nAs  this  Court  admonished  in  Mortgage  Bankers, \ncourts have no authority to impose procedural require-\nments beyond those stated in the APA. Id. Procedural \nfairness does not prevent an agency from “unilaterally \nand unexpectedly” adopting a different interpretation \nof a regulation the agency is charged with implement-\ning. Id. at 1209. Although agencies cannot simply ignore \nwhen the new policy “rests upon factual findings that \ncontradict those which underlay its prior policy,” they \nneed only provide a reasoned explanation and justify \n\n7 \n \nthe change. Id. The APA sets the maximum procedural \nobligations for which agencies must adhere. Id. at 1207.  \nFundamentally, an agency’s policy change need sat-\nisfy only the standard it would be held to in the first in-\nstance  under  the  APA.  Fox  Television  Stations,  556 \nU.S.  at 515. “This means that the agency need not al-\nways  provide  a  more  detailed  justification  than  what \nwould suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.” \nId. There is “no basis . . . for a requirement that all \nagency change be subjected to more searching review.” \nId. at 514. The Court made clear that Motor Vehicles \nManufacturers Ass’n v.  State Farm Mutual Automo-\nbile Insurance Co., 103 S. Ct. 2856 (1983), “neither held \nnor implied that every agency action representing a pol-\nicy change must be justified by reasons more substan-\ntial than those required to adopt a policy in the first in-\nstance.” Id. \nApplying the APA in a contrary manner would in-\ntrude on the President’s Article II obligation to ensure \n“that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. \nII, § 3; see Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, \n563 U.S. 125, 133 (2011) (“The legislative and executive \ndepartments of the Federal Government, no less than \nthe judicial department, have a duty to defend the Con-\nstitution.”). When the Executive determines that a prior \nunilateral executive action is unconstitutional and dis-\ncontinues  it,  judicial  review  cannot  involve  a  free-\nranging  inquiry  beyond  the  specific  standard  written \ninto the APA.  \nThis is not to say an agency should act beyond the \nscope of its statutorily defined authority or that such \nactions can never be reviewed. If agency policy was “not \nin accordance with the law” in the first place, it is owed \n\n8 \n \nno deference. Courts, however, are not permitted to ap-\nply heightened standards of review to pass on agency \npolicy decisions. In reviewing agency action, a court is \nprohibited  from  substituting  its  policy  judgments  for \nthose of the agency, whose change in policy must be \nsustained when it passes muster under the same stand-\nard  it  would  have  been  held  to  in  the  first  instance. \nFERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 136 S. Ct. 760, 782 \n(2016); Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 513-14. \nB.  DACA’s wind-down satisfies APA review. \nAs explained above, DACA’s wind-down may be en-\njoined only if Plaintiffs can overcome APA review.4 The \norder winding down DACA satisfies that standard easi-\nly, for the reasons the petition describes. The Executive \nhas correctly concluded that DACA is unlawful. No law \nmandates the policy choices DACA embodies. That was \nwhy  several  States,  led  by  Texas,  threatened  to  sue \n(and then did sue) to enjoin its continuation. The courts \nbelow were thus wrong to block DACA’s rescission. \n1.  The  administration  prudently  decided  to  wind \ndown DACA in part because of the multi-State legal \nchallenge to DACA’s lawfulness. On June 29, 2017, the \n                                            \n4 The Executive’s decisions to create and, later, to wind down \nDACA are reviewable agency actions under the APA. The APA \ncontains a limited exception barring judicial review when an agen-\ncy decision is “committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2). This exception is “very narrow.” Heckler v. Chaney, \n470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985). Unreviewability under Heckler applies \nonly to “an agency’s refusal to take . . . action,” such as “an agen-\ncy’s decision not to take enforcement action.” Id. at 831, 832. In \ncontrast, “when an agency does act,” the “action itself provides a \nfocus  for  judicial  review”  and  “can  be  reviewed  to  determine \nwhether the agency exceeded its statutory powers.” Id. at 832. \n\n9 \n \nTexas  Attorney  General,  nine  other  State  Attorneys \nGeneral, and one Governor sent a letter to the federal \nExecutive Branch proposing a DACA wind-down to end \nthe Texas I litigation challenging the Executive’s ability \nto unilaterally confer lawful presence and work authori-\nzation. A.R. 238-40. The coalition promised to voluntari-\nly  dismiss  the  lawsuit  challenging  unlawful  deferred-\naction  programs  if  the  Executive  Branch  agreed,  by \nSeptember 5, 2017, to rescind DACA and not renew or \nissue any new DACA permits in the future. A.R. 240.5 \nThe letter explained why DACA was unlawful, giv-\nen that “[c]ourts blocked DAPA and Expanded DACA \nfrom  going  into  effect,  holding  that  the  Executive \nBranch does  not  have  the  unilateral  power  to  confer \nlawful presence and work authorization on unlawfully \npresent  aliens  simply  because  the  Executive  chooses \nnot to remove them.” A.R. 238. Rather, “[i]n specific \nand detailed provisions, the [Immigration and National-\nity Act] expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes of aliens to be lawfully \npresent.” A.R. 238 (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d at 179). \n“Entirely  absent  from  those  specific  classes  is  the \ngroup of 4.3 million illegal aliens who would be eligible \nfor  lawful presence  under DAPA.”  A.R.  238  (quoting \nTexas I, 809 F.3d at 179). Likewise, “[t]he INA also \n                                            \n5 On the same day that the Texas Attorney General sent the \nletter, he also issued a press release publicly announcing the \nletter. AG Paxton Leads 10-State Coalition Urging Trump \nAdministration to Phase Out Unlawful Obama-Era DACA \nProgram, \nhttps://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-\npaxton-leads-10-state-coalition-urging-trump-administration-\nto-phase-out (June 29, 2017). \n\n10 \n \nspecifies classes of aliens eligible and ineligible for work \nauthorization,” but makes “no mention of the class of \npersons whom DAPA would make eligible for work au-\nthorization.” A.R. 238-39 (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d at \n180-81). DAPA was “foreclosed by Congress’s careful \nplan.” A.R. 238-39 (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d at 186). \nThus, \n  For  these  same  reasons  that  DAPA  and \nExpanded DACA’s unilateral Executive Branch \nconferral of eligibility for lawful presence and \nwork  authorization  was  unlawful,  the  original \nJune 15, 2012 DACA memorandum is also un-\nlawful.  The  original  2012  DACA  program  co-\nvers over one million otherwise unlawfully pre-\nsent  aliens.  Id.  at  147.  And  just  like  DAPA, \nDACA unilaterally confers eligibility for work \nauthorization, id., and lawful presence without \nany statutory authorization from Congress. \nA.R. 238-39. \nThis  letter  thus  threatened  litigation  over  DACA \nand provided legal arguments, based on precedent, ex-\nplaining why DACA was unlawful. Even if this letter \nwere the only cited reason for the challenged Executive \naction, it would provide a non-arbitrary, non-capricious, \nand valid basis for ending DACA. \n2. Texas has explained for years how DACA is un-\nlawful. The June 2017 letter’s explanation of DACA’s \nillegality was based on Texas’s victory, leading a 27-\nState coalition, in challenging the materially identical \nExpanded DACA and DAPA programs. See, e.g., Texas \nI, 809 F.3d at 174 n.139 (“DACA is an apt comparator to \nDAPA.”). In that litigation, counsel of record told the \n\n11 \n \nFifth Circuit that DACA was required to go through \nAPA  notice-and-comment  procedure.  Oral  Arg.  at \n1:16:01-10, Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733 (5th \nCir. 2015) (No. 15-40238), http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov \n/OralArgRecordings/15/15-40238_4-17-2015.mp3. DACA \nwas instituted without that procedure. \nTexas also filed a brief for a 14-State coalition urg-\ning the Court to grant certiorari in Brewer v. Arizona \nDream Act Coalition, No. 16-1180 (U.S. May 1, 2017). \nSee Br. for the States of Texas et al., Brewer v. Ariz. \nDream Act Coalition, No. 16-1180, 2017 WL 1629324 \n(U.S. May 1, 2017) (“Texas Brewer Br.”). Those amici \nStates explained that DACA was unlawful—based on \nthe  same  substantive  and  procedural  arguments  suc-\ncessfully made by the 27-State coalition in Texas I re-\ngarding Expanded DACA and DAPA. See Br. for the \nState Respondents at 44-70, United States v. Texas, 136 \nS.  Ct.  2271  (2016)  (No.  15-674),  2016  WL  1213267 \n(“Texas DAPA Br.”). \nThe Brewer amici explained that DACA is unlawful \nbecause “[d]eferred action under DACA is much more \nthan just a decision not to pursue removal of the alien.” \nTexas Brewer Br. at 3. The Executive deems deferred \naction  under  DACA  to  confer  “lawful  presence.”  Id. \nConferring that legal status is more than mere inaction. \nAs the States highlighted, Congress used “lawful pres-\nence” status (or “unlawful presence”) as the predicate \nfor numerous results, such as removability, id. at 9; a 3-\nyear or 10-year reentry bar, id. at 10-11; eligibility for \n“advance parole,” id. at 11; and eligibility for numerous \nfederal benefits, id. at 12-13. Those consequences turn \non the “lawful presence” status conferred unilaterally \n\n12 \n \nby the Executive under DACA and DAPA. And that \nconferral contravenes federal law. See id. \nSimilarly, the States explained that DACA violated \nstatutes governing which aliens are authorized to work \nin this country:  \n[W]hen  Congress  wanted  to  provide  work-\nauthorization eligibility to four narrow classes \nof deferred-action recipients, it did so by stat-\nute. Otherwise, the 1986 IRCA “prohibit[s] the \nemployment of aliens who are unauthorized to \nwork in the United States because they either \nentered the country illegally, or are in an im-\nmigration  status  which  does  not  permit  em-\nployment.” H.R. Rep. No. 99-682(I), at 46, 51-52 \n(1986),  reprinted  in  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  5649, \n5650, 5655-56 (emphasis added). \nId. at 15-16 (footnote omitted). And the States surveyed \nvarious historical practices, explaining how they could \nnot support DACA’s unilateral conferral of lawful pres-\nence and work authorization. Id. at 18-20. \nAt a minimum, this substantial background merited \nlegitimate doubts that DACA was lawful. The Executive \nproperly  deemed  it  “likely  that  potentially  imminent \nlitigation  would  yield  similar  results  with  respect  to \nDACA” as with respect to Expanded DACA and DAPA, \nwhich were already enjoined. Pet. App. 116a.  \n3. Ultimately, after their warnings went unheeded, \nTexas  and  several  other  States  filed  suit  on  May  1, \n2018,  seeking  a  declaration that  DACA  was  unlawful \nand a preliminary injunction. See Texas II, 328 F. Supp. \n3d 707. \n\n13 \n \nFollowing  extensive  discovery  and  an  extended \nhearing on the State’s motion for injunctive relief, the \ndistrict court found that DACA was unlawful for sub-\nstantially the same reasons as described above. “DACA \nprevents the removal of its recipients—whom Congress \nhas deemed removable.” Id. at 714. The court, “guided \nby  Fifth  Circuit  precedent,”  held  that  “none  of  the \nclaimed statutory provisions [in the INA] give the DHS \nthe authority to implement DACA.” Id. at 715. “Ulti-\nmately, ‘the INA expressly and carefully provides legal \ndesignations  allowing  defined  classes  of  aliens  to  be \nlawfully  present,’  and  Congress  has  not  granted  the \nExecutive Branch free rein to grant lawful presence to \nsuch a large class of persons outside the ambit of the \nstatutory scheme.” Id. at 716. \nRegarding work authorization, the court also found \nthat the INA “describes specific groups of aliens for \nwhom  Congress  intended  work  authorization  to  be \navailable,” but “make[s] no mention of the group of al-\niens described by DACA.” Id. at 716-17 (citation omit-\nted). “Congress has in other places specified groups of \naliens  to  be  ineligible  for  work  authorization,”  yet \nDACA  “contradicts  Congress’s  intent,  as  it  enables \nthose aliens to apply for work authorizations.” Id. at 717 \n(citation omitted). Thus, “[p]ermitting the [Executive] \nto allow 1.5 million aliens to receive work authorization \ncontradicts the clear congressional purpose of preserv-\ning employment opportunities for those persons legally \nresiding in the United States.” Id. at 718. \nThe court also noted the path to citizenship that \nDACA facilitates. DACA, through advance parole, “en-\nable[s] certain individuals to change their inadmissible \nstatus (due to unlawful entry) into an admitted/paroled \n\n14 \n \ncategory and in some cases provide a clearer pathway \nto citizenship.” Id. at 720. DACA thus “directly under-\nmines the intent and deterrent effect intended by Con-\ngress,  and  contradicts  the  express  wording  of  the \nDACA program’s instituting memorandum.” Id. \nMoreover,  the  court  rejected  various  grounds  on \nwhich DACA’s supporters have attempted to justify it. \nDACA, like DAPA, “is far from any program conducted \nin the past.” Id. at 721.  “DACA is ‘manifestly contrary’ \nto the statutory scheme promulgated by Congress,” and \n“usurps  the  power  of  Congress  to  dictate  a  national \nscheme of immigration laws, and it is therefore contrary \nto the INA and unreasonable.” Id. at 722-23. “As were \nDAPA and Expanded DACA, DACA is ‘foreclosed by \nCongress’s careful plan.’ The fact that DAPA was three \ntimes the size of DACA is of no legal significance.” Id. \nat 724 (citation omitted). Ultimately, DACA \ncontradicts statutory law and violates the APA \nbecause the INA directly addresses the issues \nof lawful presence and work authorization for \naliens in this country but does not include those \ndesignated by DACA. Furthermore, the award \nof lawful presence and an entire array of feder-\nal, state, and local rights and benefits to aliens \nCongress has deemed inadmissible flies in the \nface of the INA’s goals of deciding who comes \nto and stays in the United States, who works in \nthe United States, and who qualifies for gov-\nernment-funded benefits.  \nId. at 735. \nThe court also explained that DACA was procedur-\nally invalid under the APA. It rejected the premise that \n\n15 \n \nDACA was a procedural rule based on the same reason-\ning in Texas I. Id. at 728. “An agency rule that modifies \nsubstantive rights and interests can only be nominally \nprocedural, and the exemption for such rules of agency \nprocedure cannot apply.’’ Id. (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d \nat 176). DACA failed that test because \n[o]ver 800,000 individuals have already received \nthe benefit of lawful presence. Most have re-\nceived work authorization, and over half a mil-\nlion more individuals are or will be eligible to \napply. . . . No matter which party’s briefs and \nexhibits one reviews, each stresses the impact \nof the DACA program. . . . Although the DACA \nprogram  has  conferred  lawful  presence  on  a \nsmaller  number  of  people  than  DAPA  would \nhave, it has nonetheless impacted the Plaintiff \nStates  and  affected  individuals  in  an  equally \nimportant manner.  \nId. at 728. \nJust as with DAPA and Expanded DACA in Texas \nI, DACA was not a procedural rule because DACA “es-\ntablished  ‘the  substantive  standards  by  which  the \n[agency] evaluate[d] applications which [sought] a bene-\nfit  that  the  agency  [purportedly]  ha[d]  the  power  to \nprovide.’” Id. at 728-79 (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d at \n177). The “five criteria by which DACA applicants are \nevaluated are clearly substantive standards and are no \ndifferent than the DAPA criteria at issue in Texas I.” \nId. at 729. \nNor could DACA be defended as a general policy \nstatement exempt from notice and comment. “[W]hile \nlabels are not unimportant, the true test is how the pro-\n\n16 \n \ngram  is  actually  administered  and  whether  it  affects \nrights and obligations.” Id. Just as in Texas I, “[a] gen-\neral statement of policy ‘genuinely leaves the agency \nand  its  decision-makers  free  to  exercise  discretion,’” \nand “does not impose any rights and obligations,” which \ncannot be said of DACA. Id. at 730 (quoting Texas I, \n809 F.3d at 171).  \nThe court found it “clear” that “the DACA program \nconfers  rights  and  imposes  obligations.”  Id.  at  731. \nDACA recipients receive “lawful presence, the right to \napply for work authorization, Social Security, Medicare, \naccess to advance parole, and an array of other federal \nand state benefits.” Id. “DACA also impacts the obliga-\ntions of the individual States” by forcing them “to spend \nmoney on various social services.” Id. And DACA “obli-\ngates the Government to forebear from implementing \nimmigration enforcement proceedings.” Id. “These are \ncertainly the kinds of rights and obligations that give a \nprogram  ‘binding  effect’  such  that  the  notice-and-\ncomment procedures are required.” Id. \nNor could APA notice and comment be avoided by \npurported  discretion  in  conferring  DACA  benefits. \nThere  was  “overwhelming  evidence  concerning  the \nrights  conferred  and the  obligations imposed.” Id.  at \n735. As with Texas I, “‘this case is about the [DHS] \nSecretary’s decision to change the immigration classifi-\ncation of millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis.’” \nId. at 735 (quoting Texas I, 809 F.3d at 170). As Execu-\ntive action, DACA “must at least undergo the formali-\nties of notice and comment.” Id. at 736. \n*  *  * \n\n17 \n \nIn short, the Southern District of Texas, has con-\nfirmed that DACA is unlawful. That is further reason to \nconclude  that  the  administration  did  not  violate  the \nAPA by ending a discretionary—and unconstitutional—\nprogram.  \nII.  DACA’s  Obvious  Unlawfulness  Is  Further  \nReason to Grant Review. \nA.  DACA contravenes federal law. \nDACA  is  substantively  unlawful  for  the  reasons \nthat the Fifth Circuit held Expanded DACA and DAPA \nunlawful. See supra Part I. Purported differences be-\ntween DAPA and DACA cannot justify the latter. \nFirst, the fact that DACA applies to a smaller num-\nber of aliens than DAPA does not make DACA lawful. \nDAPA and DACA’s unlawfulness turns on those pro-\ngrams unilaterally conferring lawful presence and ac-\ncess to work authorization—not on their comparative \nsize. Texas, 809 F.3d at 178-86. Moreover, even were it \nrelevant, DACA and DAPA both far exceed the size of \nany  prior  deferred-action program.  See  Texas  DAPA \nBr. 53-59. \nNor can DACA be defended on the basis that Con-\ngress has provided a (demanding) path to lawful pres-\nence  for  some  aliens  covered  by  DAPA,  while  not \nproviding  any  path  at  all  for  the  aliens  covered  by \nDACA. That argument only undermines the position of \nDACA’s supporters. It means that DACA has even few-\ner arguments to support it than did DAPA. See Josh \nBlackman, The Constitutionality of DAPA Part I: Con-\ngressional Acquiescence to Deferred Action, 103 Geo. \nL.J. Online 96, 116 (2015). Whereas past instances of \ndeferred action had been defended on the ground that \n\n18 \n \nthey were stop-gap measures to ultimate lawful status \ntheoretically obtainable under existing law, see Texas, \n809 F.3d at 184-85 & n.197, DACA flouts Congress’s \nscheme for conferring lawful presence and cannot pos-\nsibly be defended on that basis. \nB.  DACA  is  procedurally  unlawful  because  it \nwas  promulgated  contrary  to  the  APA’s  \nrequirements.  \nPlaintiffs’ own pleadings in the various challenges \nto DACA’s rescission confirm that DACA is procedural-\nly unlawful (even assuming arguendo executive power \nto create it) because DACA was a substantive rule sub-\nject to APA notice-and-comment procedure. \nDACA is indisputably a “rule” for APA purposes. 5 \nU.S.C. § 551(4). Accordingly, DACA had to be issued \nthrough notice-and-comment procedure if it was a sub-\nstantive rule rather than a mere “general statement[] of \npolicy.” Texas, 809 F.3d at 171 (alteration in original). \nThe key distinction between policy statements and sub-\nstantive rules is that policy statements cannot be “bind-\ning.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979); \nsee Texas DAPA Br. at 61-62. \nA rule is binding if it creates or modifies “rights \nand obligations.” E.g., Prof’ls & Patients for Custom-\nized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir. 1995), \nMcLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317, \n1320 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199 \n(1974), this Court held that a vastly more modest rule \nconcerning  benefits  eligibility  “affect[ed]  individual \nrights and obligations” and therefore had to be treated \nas a substantive rule. Id. at 232. The same is true of \nDACA, under plaintiffs’ own pleadings. \n\n19 \n \n1. This case involves orders entered in multiple ac-\ntions and, therefore, multiple plaintiffs. The University \nof California plaintiffs, for example, contend that the \nDACA-wind-down  memorandum  “constitutes  a  sub-\nstantive rule subject to APA’s notice-and-comment re-\nquirements.” Complaint at 14 ¶ 61, Regents of Univ. of \nCal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 3:17-cv-05211 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 8, 2017), ECF No. 1. \nBut that could be true only if the creation of DACA \nwas itself a substantive rule—one “affecting individual \nrights and obligations.” Ruiz, 415 U.S. at 232. If DACA \nwere not a substantive rule that changed the rights of \nrecipients, then winding down this program also could \nnot  be  a  substantive  rule  changing  rights.  Plaintiffs, \nhowever, allege that DACA is just such a substantive \nrule. First, plaintiffs admit that DACA purports to uni-\nlaterally confer lawful presence:  \nIndividuals with DACA status were “not con-\nsidered to be unlawfully present during the pe-\nriod in which deferred action [was] in effect.” \nUSCIS FAQs.  \nComplaint at 8 ¶ 31, Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. 3:17-\ncv-05211, ECF No. 1. And plaintiffs admit that aliens \nwith DACA status would not have been able—but for \nDACA—to lawfully “obtain jobs and access to certain \nSocial Security and Medicare benefits.” Id. at 2. The \nnecessary implication of those pleadings is that DACA \nwas unlawful all along, as it issued without notice and \ncomment.  \nThere is no requirement that the government must \nuse notice-and-comment procedure to rescind a policy \nwhose issuance needed but did not receive that proce-\n\n20 \n \ndure. If the APA somehow required the federal Execu-\ntive  Branch  to  continue  enforcing  an  unlawful  policy \nwhile notice-and-comment procedure was used for the \nfirst time to rescind the policy, then the APA would be \nunconstitutional as applied to that unlawful policy.  \n2. The State of California plaintiffs likewise essen-\ntially plead that DACA’s attributes meet the test for a \nsubstantive  rule  requiring  APA  notice-and-comment \nprocedure.  For  instance,  these  plaintiffs  plead  that \n“DACA Provides Numerous Benefits”: \n  82. DACA grantees are provided with nu-\nmerous  benefits.  Most  importantly,  they  are \ngranted the right not to be arrested or detained \nbased solely on their immigration status during \nthe designated period of their deferred action. \n  83. DACA grantees are granted eligibility \nto receive employment authorization. \n  84.  DACA  also  opened  the  door  to  allow \ntravel for DACA grantees. For example, DACA \ngrantees  were  allowed  to  briefly  depart  the \nU.S. and legally return . . . . \n  85.  Unlike  other  undocumented  immi-\ngrants, DACA grantees are not disqualified on \nthe basis of their immigration status from re-\nceiving  certain  public  benefits.  These  include \nfederal Social Security, retirement, and disa-\nbility benefits.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), \n1621(d). . . . \n  86. DACA grantees are able to secure equal \naccess to other benefits and opportunities . . . . \nComplaint at 17-18, California v. U.S. Dep’t of Home-\n\n21 \n \nland Sec., No. 3:17-cv-05235-WHA (N.D. Cal. Sept. 11, \n2017), ECF No. 1 (emphases added; citations omitted). \nThe Garcia plaintiffs here admit the same thing. Com-\nplaint at 9 ¶ 27, Garcia v. United States, No. 3:17-cv-\n5380 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 18, 2017), ECF No. 1 (“DACA \nconfers numerous important benefits on those who ap-\nply for and are granted DACA status.”) (emphases add-\ned).6 \n3. In addition to the five challenges pending in the \nNorthern District of California, several other lawsuits, \npending in the Second and D.C. Circuits challenge the \nDACA-wind-down  memorandum.  Complaint,  Trs.  of \nPrinceton  Univ.  v.  United  States,  No.  1:17-cv-2325 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 3, 2017), ECF No. 1; Complaint, NAACP \nv.  Trump,  No.  1:17-cv-1907  (D.D.C.  Sept.  18,  2017), \nECF No. 1; 3d Am. Complaint, Batalla Vidal v. Niel-\nsen,  No.  1:16-cv-4756  (E.D.N.Y. Dec.  11,  2017),  ECF \nNo. 113; Complaint, New York v. Trump, No. 1:17-cv-\n5228 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2017), ECF. No. 1. Plaintiffs in \nthose cases similarly have pleaded, in substance, that \nDACA was unlawful from the outset because it confers \nsubstantive rights yet was issued without notice-and-\ncomment procedure. \nPlaintiffs  in  New  York,  for  example,  plead  that \nDACA affirmatively confers benefits: \n                                            \n6 Furthermore, the California plaintiffs state that the APA \ndoes  not  allow  policies  to  remain  in  effect  when  they  are \n“predicated on an incorrect legal premise.” Complaint at 22 \n¶ 106, California, No. 3:17-cv-5235, ECF No. 1. Since DACA \nrests on an incorrect legal premise in that it issued without \nnotice-and-comment procedure, plaintiffs cannot obtain the \nrelief they seek of DACA’s continued operation. \n\n22 \n \n  [¶] 218.  DACA  confers  numerous  benefits \non DACA grantees. Notably, DACA grantees \nare granted the right not to be arrested or de-\ntained based solely on their immigration status \n. . . . \n  [¶] 220. DACA grantees are eligible to re-\nceive certain public benefits. These include So-\ncial Security, retirement, and disability bene-\nfits,  and,  in  certain  states,  benefits  such  as \ndriver’s  licenses  or  unemployment  insurance. \nSee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d).  \nComplaint at 41, New York, No. 1:17-cv-5228, ECF No. \n1 (emphases added; citations omitted).  \n  Accordingly, these plaintiffs essentially admit that \nDACA needed to go through APA notice-and-comment \nprocedure because it was a substantive rule: \n  [¶] 289. In implementing the DHS Memo-\nrandum,  federal  agencies  have  changed  the \nsubstantive criteria by which individual DACA \ngrantees work, live, attend school, obtain cred-\nit,  and  travel  in  the  United  States.  Federal \nagencies did not follow the procedures required \nby  the  APA  before  taking  action  impacting \nthese substantive rights. \nId. at 54 (emphases added).  \nIf  DACA’s  rescission  “affect[ed]  individual  rights \nand obligations,” Ruiz, 415 U.S. at 232, then DACA’s \ncreation did so, too, and was always unlawful. \n\n23 \n \nIII. Granting Certiorari to Allow Resolution of All \nThree DACA-Rescission Challenges This Term Is \nWarranted. \nWithout this Court’s prompt intervention, the or-\nders enjoining the Executive from winding down DACA \ncould  last  more  than  another  year—frustrating  the \npurpose of the Executive’s decision to promptly termi-\nnate disputes about DACA’s legality. Indeed, because \nthe litigation challenging the DACA wind-down memo-\nrandum has persisted, Texas was forced to sue to chal-\nlenge the June 15, 2012 memorandum creating DACA \nand its continued implementation.  \nThe district court in Texas II found that Texas con-\ntinues  to  suffer  ongoing  and  irreparable  harm  from \nDACA.  The  States  “bear  the  costs  of  providing \n[healthcare, education, and law-enforcement] social ser-\nvices required by federal law, and the DACA program \nincreases the volume of individuals to whom they must \nprovide these services.” 328 F. Supp. 3d at 700. Even \nthe  expert  for  parties  defending  DACA  in  Texas  II \nopined that Texas alone “incurs more than $250,000,000 \nin total direct costs from DACA recipients per year.” \nId. at 700-01. And DACA “increases the total number of \nindividuals  using  Texas's  social  services.”  Id.  at  701. \nAdditionally, DACA harms the States’ interests in pro-\ntecting the economic well-being of their citizens through \nincreased competition “with legally present individuals \nfor available jobs, which can result in DACA recipients \nbeing hired for jobs for which legally present individu-\nals have applied and otherwise would have been hired.” \nId. at 693. \n\n24 \n \nGranting certiorari to allow for prompt resolution \nof all the disputed aspects of DACA’s rescission would \nreduce the present burdens to the courts from the exist-\ning litigation. Moreover, the Texas II litigation could \nresult in a ruling abruptly ending DACA, rather than \nwinding  it  down  as  directed by the  Executive  in  the \nmemorandum challenged here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \ngranted. \n \n  Respectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON  KYLE D.
