    "summary": "<p>On May 28, 2014, approximately 125 police officers from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The case was assigned to Judge Marsha J. Pechman. The plaintiffs each individually sued the U.S. Department of Justice and the City of Seattle, including the SPD and the Seattle Police Monitor Team, under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 for their roles in implementing Seattleโs new use of force policy (UF policy). The new UF policy limited police officersโ ability to use force against civilians without repercussions, and the plaintiffs argued that this policy violated their constitutional rights under the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, they alleged that the policy violated their constitutional right to self-defense, as well as Due Process and Equal Protection. Initially representing themselves pro se, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, damages, and attorneysโ fees and costs.</p><p>On August 21, 2014, the City of Seattle moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. It alleged that the plaintiffs had misunderstood both what their constitutional rights were and what the new UF policy did, as the officersโ claims were not supported by the U.S. Constitution or by case law. On the same day, the Seattle Police Monitor Team filed a motion to dismiss the case because the members of the monitor team had quasi-judicial immunity. The monitors were appointed by the court as part of a consent decree from an earlier settlement in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12295\"><i>United States v. City of Seattle</i></a> regarding the SPDโs excessive use of force. So, the monitors argued, they could not be considered part of the city the way that the SPD could. </p><p>Six days after the motions were filed, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added new factual allegations about the policy and removed those plaintiffs that no longer wished to litigate. The amended complaint emphasized the idea of constitutional self-defense as a right embedded in several amendments rather than stated outright. In September 2014, the defendants filed two motions to dismiss offering arguments similar to those found in the motions to dismiss the original complaint. On October 9, the court held oral arguments on the issue. The plaintiffs also obtained private counsel during this month. </p><p>On October 17, 2014, the court granted both motions to dismiss. Because the complaint had already been amended once and amending it further would be โfutile,โ Judge Pechman dismissed the case with prejudice. 62 F.Supp.3d 1215. The court held that the monitor team had quasi-judicial immunity and, even without it, the plaintiffsโ claims betrayed their misunderstanding regarding what their constitutional rights were, and the constitutional right to self-defense did not exist; the plaintiffs had failed to allege that any of the defendants had violated their rights.</p><p>On November 14, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower courtโs decision nearly three years later, on September 19, 2017, finding that neither the case law nor the constitution entitled the plaintiffs to self-defense. 871 F.3d 873.</p><p>On December 28, 2017, the plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear this case. On April 2, 2018, their petition was denied. The plaintiffs exhausted their options for appealing this case, and it is now closed.</p><p></p>",

JURISDICTION and PARTIES \n21  1.  Plaintiffs are sworn officers of the Seattle Police Department (SPD) and are \n22  listed below.  Plaintiffs bring to the court's attention that some officers \nhave been added to the list below who were not Plaintiffs in the original \n23 \ncomplaint.  Some Plaintiffs have been removed who were part of the original \n24 \ncomplaint, and these officers are no longer Plaintiffs.   \n25 \n2.  Plaintiff officers bring this action against the City of Seattle (City), \n26 \nincluding the SPD, under 42 USC ยง 1983, alleging that Defendants have \n27 \nintentionally and recklessly deprived Plaintiffs of the rights and \n28 \nprotections secured for them by the Constitution under color of policies and \n \n1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 2 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \npractices of the City related to Plaintiffs' use of force. The City \n1 \npromulgated a new use of force policy (\"UF Policy\") that unreasonably \n2 \nrestricts and burdens Plaintiffs' right to use force necessarily required to \n3 \nprotect and defend the public and officers from apparent danger in violation \n4  of Plaintiffs' right of self-defense. This is a fundamental individual right \n5  embedded in the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The \n6  intended effect of the new UF Policy is to delay and greatly limit officers' \nresort to a full range of force tools and techniques and to eliminate their \n7 \ndiscretion.  The real world effect is to induce a reluctance by patrol \n8 \nofficers to use appropriate and sufficient levels of force to control \n9 \ndangerous suspects, thus putting officers, suspects, and the general public \n10 \nat unnecessary and unreasonable risk of injury or death. \n11 \n3.  Plaintiffs also bring this action against the Mayor of Seattle (Mayor), Ed \n12 \nMurray, individually and in his official capacity, under 42 USC ยง 1983, \n13  based on his involvement in the implementation of the UF Policy. \n14  4.  Plaintiffs also bring this action against the Seattle Police Monitor \n15  (Monitor), Merrick Bobb, individually and in his official capacity, under 42 \nUSC ยง 1983, based on his control over the promulgation and implementation of \n16 \nthe unconstitutional UF Policy. \n17 \n5.  Plaintiffs also bring this action against Seattle's City Attorney (City \n18 \nAttorney), Peter Holmes, under 42 USC ยง 1983, based on his involvement in \n19 \nthe promulgation and implementation of the unconstitutional UF Policy. \n20 \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this action, under 28 USC ยง1331, against the United States \n21 \nAttorney General (AG), Eric Holder, individually.  The United States \n22  Department of Justice (DOJ) improperly required the new UF Policy as a \n23  remedy for a fundamentally flawed finding, and it demanded that the new UF \nPolicy contain the unconstitutional provisions complained of below. \n24 \n7.  Plaintiffs also bring this action against the United States Attorney for the \n25 \nWestern District of Washington, Jenny Durkan, individually, under 28 USC ยง \n26 \n1331, on the above basis and for her role in implementation of the \n27 \nunconstitutional UF Policy. \n28 \n \n2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 3 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nII. BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF \n1  THE NEW UF POLICY THAT BURDEN PLAINTIFFS' RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE \n \n2  8.  On December 17, 2013, Judge Robart, United States District Court Judge for the \nWestern District of Washington at Seattle, issued an order approving an alleged \n3 \n\"Consensus Use of Force Policy\" (UF Policy) to govern SPD.  Judge Robart approved \n4 \nthe policy as appropriate โfor the present circumstances.\" It went into effect on \n5 \nJanuary 1, 2014.  Officers were required to have read the new policy by that date, \n6 \nand officers' conduct has been evaluated under the policy since that date. \n7 \n9.  The \"circumstances\" referred to by Judge Robart include an investigation opened in \n8 \nMarch, 2011 by DOJ regarding whether or not SPD officers deprived individuals of \n9  their constitutional rights by patterns and practices of discriminatory policing or \n10  excessive use of force.  After its investigation, DOJ was unable to make any \nfindings of discriminatory policing.  However, DOJ did issue 'findings' including \n11 \nthat SPD patrol officers use force \"in an unconstitutional manner nearly 20% of the \n12 \ntime.\" The City \"dispute[d] the alleged patterns or practices of excessive force \n13 \nalleged in DOJ's report,\"  and the findings were discredited by an independent \n14 \nanalysis by a former DOJ statistician and current professor at Seattle University. \n15 \n10. Nevertheless, Judge Robart approved the UF Policy as \"the most appropriate remedy,\" \n16 \nnoting DOJ's conclusion that SPD's former policy was too \"vague\" and left \"too much \n17  room for officer discretion.\" Judge Robart held that \"comprehensive, clear and \n18  specific policies\" were thus needed.  This contradicts long-standing Supreme Court \n19  holdings that consistently acknowledge but reject concerns about 'vagueness' and \n'troubling uncertainty,' holding that simplicity, flexibility, and deference to the \n20 \nofficer, instead, are essential for standards governing lawful police action, \n21 \nespecially regarding search and seizure, including force. \n22 \n11. Judge Robart indicated that his role was to \"insure\" that the UF Policy was \n23 \nconstitutional.  However, his cursory, one-and-one-half-page order contains no \n24 \nsubstantive analysis of the UF Policy's constitutionality, particularly as it \n25 \nrelates to Plaintiffs' constitutional right to protect and defend the public and \n26  themselves from threatening and dangerous behavior by suspects.   \n27  12.  In July 2012, a Settlement Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (Consent \n28  Agreement) was entered into between the United States and the City.  The City \n \n3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 4 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nagreed to develop a new UF policy consistent with the constitutional requirements \n1 \nof Graham v. Connor.   The stated goal of the parties was to create polices that \n2 \nare constitutional and that \"ensure public and officer safety.\"  The City was \n3 \nsupposed to retain appropriate \"flexibility\" and have the \"ability to develop local \n4  and cost effective solutions.\"   \n5  13. The Consent Agreement also provided that the parties would select a federal monitor \n6  to oversee implementation of the Consent Agreement.  Defendant Merrick Bobb \n(Monitor) is that monitor.  To date, based on bills reported publicly, the City has \n7 \npaid Mr. Bobb and his staff well over $1,300,000.00.  The Monitor publicizes his \n8 \nwork regarding the Consent Decree on a website called the \"Website of the Seattle \n9 \nPolice Monitor\" (seattlemonitor.com).  The Monitor maintains another website, \n10 \nโPolice Assessment Resource Centerโ (www.parc.info), that promotes the full range \n11 \nof services Mr. Bobb will provide for a fee to promote and induce civilian \n12 \noversight and accountability. It is clear from the PARC website that his \n13  organization has a zealous agenda to spread the message of police reform and to \n14  steer police departments into adopting similarly written, highly proscriptive UF \n15  policies.  Mr. Bobb, who has no law enforcement training or experience as a police \nofficer, has made clear that his mission is to change fundamentally the nature of \n16 \npolice encounters, i.e. to severely restrict police officers' authority to exercise \n17 \ndiscretion and use force. \n18 \n14. On November 27, 2013, the Monitor submitted the UF Policy approved by Judge Robart, \n19 \nwith an accompanying Memorandum to the Court (UF Memorandum).  The Monitor concedes \n20 \nthat it is not his role to write the new UF Policy and states unconvincingly that \n21 \nin his role as Monitor he merely evaluated and gave deference to the alleged \n22  recommendations of, and policy written by, the parties themselves (the City and \n23  SPD). \n15. Plaintiffs are primarily SPD patrol officers, or officers responsible for training \n24 \npatrol officers. They are the individuals most significantly and immediately \n25 \naffected by the new UF Policy and with the most knowledge, training and experience \n26 \nregarding the UF situations facing patrol officers in Seattle.  Moreover, many SPD \n27 \npatrol officers are established and recognized experts in UF techniques, practices \n28 \n \n4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 5 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nand standards.  However, no SPD officers concurrently engaged in street policing \n1 \nduties or related training were involved in the development of the UF Policy.  \n2 \n16. Plaintiffs' supposed representative, the Seattle Police Officersโ Guild (SPOG), \n3 \nthough allegedly \"consulted\" by the Monitor, was not a party to, or at the table \n4  for, significant decisions regarding the new UF Policy.  DOJ and the Monitor choose \n5  instead, inexplicably, to consult the \"rank-and-file in Los Angeles\" to determine \n6  if the new policies \"compromise[d] the safety of Seattle police officers and the \npublic they serve.โ  The Monitor also relied on so-called police experts on the \n7 \nMonitoring Team, but it is clear from their background that it has been years since \n8 \nthey, if ever, made actual UF decisions in the line of duty. \n9 \n17. Plaintiffs also allege that the new UF Policy is not the policy written by SPD \n10 \npersonnel who were tasked with developing it.  Those personnel will testify that \n11 \nthe UF Policy they wrote was altered almost in its entirety and replaced with \n12 \nspecific language provided, and required, by the Monitor.  This supports \n13  Plaintiffs' contention that DOJ, in partnership with Mr. Bobb, intend to use \n14  consent decrees in Seattle, as well as other jurisdictions, to re-write \n15  longstanding constitutional law and principles intended to protect officer safety, \nand eliminate reasonable police practices, with which they - from the comfort and \n16 \nsafety of their desks and with no experience facing dangerous threats - disagree or \n17 \nfind distasteful.  \n18 \n18. In the very last days of the process, select Plaintiffs were invited to submit \n19 \ncomments through SPOG and a departmental website called, Idea Scale. However, it \n20 \nsoon became clear that they were token invitations after the fact.  Still, \n21 \nPlaintiffs provided a thorough review of the draft and identified how and where the \n22  draft policy conflicted with the realities facing patrol officers on the streets of \n23  Seattle, and the protections afforded officers under the Constitution. These \nconcerns were ignored.  Plaintiffs again attempted to communicate their concerns to \n24 \nthose involved in the process, before the draft became a final policy.  Plaintiffs \n25 \nwere told, in effect:  \"This is what DOJ and the Monitor are telling SPD to do \n26 \nregardless of whether or not it makes good sense or is good law.  A federal judge \n27 \nhas approved it. There's nothing SPD can do about it. It's a 'done deal'.\"  The \n28 \nMonitor has continued to make clear that he will not find the City in compliance \n \n5 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 6 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nunder the Consent Decree until it establishes and implements the specific policy \n1 \ndemanded by the Monitor and DOJ. \n2 \n19.  To say, as the Monitor does repeatedly, that the Policy represents the \"consensus\" \n3 \nand \"unified\" voice of the parties is inaccurate to the point of falsification.  As \n4  almost every other statement in the UF Memorandum acknowledges, there has been, and \n5  Plaintiffs allege continues to be, a severe lack of consensus around the UF Policy.  \n6  Despite Plaintiffs' predominant role in the implementation of and impact from the \nUF Policy, neither Plaintiffs nor SPOG, were even a party to the supposed \n7 \n'contentious' and 'exhausting' negotiations the Monitor claims led to the final \n8 \n'consensus.โ \n9 \n20. Any appearance of 'consensus' is merely due to the fact that the Monitor ran \n10 \nroughshod over any criticisms and that the various parties involved simply gave up.  \n11 \nThis is reflected in the tone of the Monitor's semiannual reports, which are self-\n12 \nserving, bullying, and dismissive.  In a recent Seattle Times article, Mr. Bobb was \n13  questioned about this lawsuit and officers' fears for their safety under the new \n14  policy.  He responded that \"the changes have led to understandable anxiety over the \n15  new policies,\" but he \"likened the situation to going to an unfamiliar supermarket \nand not knowing where to find the Cheerios.\"  Plaintiffs allege this is indicative \n16 \nof Mr. Bobb's complete disregard for officers' rights, officers' competence, and \n17 \nofficer and public safety as he pushes forward his agenda for a greatly diminished \n18 \nSeattle police force. That Mr. Bobb would equate policing the city streets and \n19 \nconfronting the possibility everyday of having to use force to protect oneself or \n20 \nothers with grocery shopping for breakfast cereal is unconscionable, although it \n21 \ndoes explain why he regards his lack of police experience as irrelevant in \n22  performing his function.  \n23  21. The falsity as to the City's and SPD's alleged agreement with the new UF Policy has \nonly become more evident since Plaintiffs filed the original complaint.  A number \n24 \nof high-level City, SPD and Guild personnel have informed Plaintiffs in private \n25 \nthat they agree with the allegations in the original complaint.  Nevertheless, \n26 \nPlaintiffs have been told that the \"politics\" of the situation, and the City's \n27 \nperceived inability to successfully fight DOJ, have left them unable to make \n28 \nsignificant changes to the policy, even during the current \"review\" of the policy \n \n6 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 7 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nbuilt into the Consent Decree.  This means that the City is now knowingly and \n1 \nwillingly playing politics with Plaintiffs' lives and the lives of the law-abiding \n2 \ncitizens of Seattle. \n3 \n22. There is increasing evidence of significant problems wrought by the new UF Policy.  \n4  Plaintiffs allege that since they filed their original complaint, assaults against \n5  SPD officers have increased significantly.  Evidence of police injuries is \n6  mounting.  Officers are turning in their TASERS in large numbers - even though such \ndevices provide reasonable and effective tools when facing threatening behavior and \n7 \nactivity.  Patrols officers will testify to an insidious new hesitation to respond \n8 \nto calls for backup.  First-responding officers, required by the UF Policy to delay \n9 \nand avoid resorting to force, are left unreasonably vulnerable when backup fails to \n10 \ncome, or comes late, and these delay and avoidance tactics fail to bring the threat \n11 \nunder control in a timely and decisive manner.   \n12 \n23. Even as Plaintiffs were filing the original complaint asserting the significant \n13  risks to public safety created by the new UF Policy, SPD itself was issuing a \n14  report regarding the sharp decrease in proactive police work to investigate and \n15  stop crime.  Citizens are feeling vulnerable as the City's streets seem ever more \nat the mercy of hostile and unstable persons. Patrol officers have retreated from \n16 \nand avoided acting in response to clear threats to their own safety and that of the \n17 \npublic for fear of accusations of violating some provision of the UF Policy or new \n18 \nexpectations and practices regarding force.  Not surprisingly, innocent bystanders \n19 \nhave expressed anger and concern at what they see as officers' failure to protect \n20 \ninnocent people.  Citizens groups are demanding more enforcement resources to deal \n21 \nwith increasingly violent incidents throughout the City. This increased lawlessness \n22  and disregard of police authority are the logical and inevitable consequences of a \n23  policy that puts the interests of criminal suspects above the rights and interests \nof citizens, officers, and the City itself. \n24 \n24. Patrol officers are currently being subject to discipline under the new UF \n25 \nPolicy both for using too much force and for using too little force, thus \n26 \nsupporting Plaintiffs' allegation that the new policy demands 'perfection', \n27 \nnot reasonableness.  This trend towards a misguided and impossible standard \n28 \nof policing began with former Mayor McGinn's politically motivated promise, \n \n7 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 8 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nto appease DOJ, that police officers using force \"will get it right every \n1 \ntime.\" This trend has now become enshrined in the Department's new policies \n2 \nand practices, as well as the attitudes of those sitting in judgment of \n3 \nofficers after the fact. Plaintiffs have taken the opportunity to observe \n4  meetings of the Use of Force Review Board (UFRB), which, under the new \n5  policy, is required for every so-called Type II and III UF incident. In \n6  specific cases, patrol officers and detectives have been criticized and/or \nrecommended for disciplinary investigation, despite having had practical \n7 \nsafety reasons for their conduct due to the dynamic and dangerous nature of \n8 \nthe situation and the threat created by the suspect.  The Monitor, who was \n9 \nin attendance at a meeting attended by Plaintiffs, emphatically stated in \n10 \nresponse to one of these cases: \"Practical considerations never trump this \n11 \npolicy.\"   This is a 180-degree contortion of officers' right to self-\n12 \ndefense and the Court's holdings that prioritize officer and public safety \n13  over the mechanical application of legal standards and policies.  \n14  25. Plaintiffs will testify to being significantly less sure of how to police \n15  under the new UF Policy than even when they first became police officers.  \nOfficers will testify that the training received under the new UF Policy has \n16 \ndone nothing to make sense of the UF Policy's confusion and complications.  \n17 \nThis is not surprising as officers cannot be trained to meet an impossible \n18 \nstandard.  None of the training addresses the crucial situation that has \n19 \nofficers scratching their heads and fearing for their lives and the lives of \n20 \nothers, including suspects: what, if any, actions can officers realistically \n21 \ntake when confronted with threatening behavior by one of the protected \n22  classes of people for whom the policy prohibits any reasonable force tools \n23  short of deadly force?  Moreover, the training materials recommended for \napproval by the Monitor regarding suspects in behavioral crisis simply \n24 \nentrench the existing problems with the UF Policy itself, demanding police \n25 \nofficers, in effect, become mental health professionals at the expense of \n26 \ntheir duty and safety.  Plaintiffs' role is, and should be, to assess the \n27 \nthreat and take reasonable actions to protect the public and themselves from \n28 \nthe risk of harm.  It cannot be stated too strongly that a threat of danger \n \n8 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 9 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nis a threat of danger, regardless of the suspect's mental health or other \n1 \nimpairments that may be contributing factors to the suspect's criminal \n2 \nbehavior! \n3 \n26. All parties agree that SPD's UF incidents often involve people with mental \n4  illness and/or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  DOJ and the Monitor \n5  seem to believe this makes all of SPD's uses of force automatically suspect.  \n6  At the same time, however, DOJ concedes in its findings letters that police \nofficers have become the first responders in a shameful national crisis.  \n7 \nDOJ recognizes there is neither the will nor the resources to provide \n8 \nappropriate treatment to the mentally ill.  DOJ acknowledges the rotating \n9 \ndoor through hospitals and jails that quickly and inevitably puts the \n10 \nmentally ill worse off, and often on the street where there is ready access \n11 \nto drugs, alcohol, and dangerous weapons, and where victims can quickly \n12 \nbecome suspects engaged in activity that threatens the public's safety.  The \n13  dangerous, unpredictable, often violent, behavior that results is well \n14  documented.  Indeed, police officers, like the public they serve, are \n15  regularly reminded of the deadly outcomes by a steady stream of horrifying \nnews stories of mentally ill people murdering people, often in large \n16 \nnumbers, here and across the country.  The difference is that officers are \n17 \non the front line of a ticking time bomb. Policy and training that require \n18 \ndelay and hesitation are not preparing officers to act decisively when, as \n19 \nwill be inevitable, they find themselves quickly and unexpectedly with their \n20 \nlives on the line.   \n21  27. Since Plaintiffs have filed this lawsuit, they have been accused of being \n22  \"fringe\" or \"rouge\" cops and dismissed as reflexively 'anti-reform.โ  \n23  Plaintiffs, however, represent a significant percentage of patrol officers, \nwhose job is to patrol the street, as well as a large number of training \n24 \npersonnel who take seriously their duty to help patrol officers come home \n25 \nsafely from each shift.  Plaintiffs have consistently supported appropriate \n26 \nreform, e.g. civilian oversight of the department by the Office of \n27 \nProfessional Accountability. Plaintiffs do not oppose reform related to UF, \n28 \n \n9 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 10 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nbut are asking that reform be consistent with officers' constitutional \n1 \nrights as well as those of suspects.  \n2 \n28. There are many extremely troubling aspects of DOJ's investigation that \n3 \nPlaintiffs do not challenge, because it is not their role or their rights \n4  are not immediately at stake.  These problems include DOJ's complete \n5  overriding of local decision-making, the Monitor's use of the Consent Decree \n6  to infiltrate and control almost every aspect of SPD, and the debilitating \nstrain on enforcement resources wrought by the new prioritization of UF \n7 \nreporting and investigation paperwork requirements over the need to respond \n8 \nto actual crime.  Plaintiffs challenge the latter only to the extent that \n9 \nthe strain puts officers' and citizens' lives in danger by pulling an \n10 \ninordinate number of officers off the street for long periods of time even \n11 \nfor relatively minor UF incidents. \n12 \n29. This is the crux and basis of all Plaintiffs' allegations.  Policy cannot \n13  stand that restricts and burdens officers' right to defend themselves and \n14  others from threats of serious harm. So-called, best practices that violate \n15  the fundamental, individual rights of police officers have no place in the \nlaw enforcement profession.  Mr. Bobb and his organization PARC have long \n16 \nbeen attempting to sell the notion that police departments are completely \n17 \nfree to adopt policies and practices that are more restrictive than the law.  \n18 \nPlaintiffs, however, contend that this freedom is not absolute. Rather, it \n19 \nis limited to the point at which it begins to tread upon the fundamental, \n20 \nindividual constitutional rights of the officers subject to such a policy. \n21 \nPlaintiffs assert that, although police officers are public servants, they \n22  are not enslaved to the government or public. Therefore, despite being \n23  representatives of the government and subject to reasonable policy \nrequirements and expectations, police officers also possess the same \n24 \nconstitutional right to self-defense as every other citizen. That any \n25 \n'reasonable' governmental official or representative would attempt to argue \n26 \notherwise not only shocks the conscience, it is anathema to the Constitution \n27 \nand the common law principles upon which it is founded. \n28 \n \n10 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 11 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n30. The new UF Policy is found in Title 8 of the Seattle Police Manual, a copy \n1 \nof which can be found on the Monitor's web site: www.seattlemonitor.com.  \n2 \nThroughout, the policy establishes rigid preconditions for the use of force \n3 \nnotwithstanding that the Court has specifically rejected such, holding that \n4  all that matters is whether the officer's actions were reasonable. \n5  31. For example, the UF Policy imposes special preconditions for the use of \n6  deadly force (defined as use of firearms or any other means likely to cause \ndeath or serious physical injury, ยง8.050).  Under ยง 8.100.5: \"Deadly force \n7 \nmay only be used in circumstances where threat of death or serious physical \n8 \ninjury to the officer or others is imminent. A danger is imminent when an \n9 \nobjectively reasonable officer would conclude that: \n10 \nโข A suspect is acting or threatening to cause death or serious physical \ninjury to the officer or others, and \n11 \nโข The suspect has the means or instrumentalities to do so, and \nโข The suspect has the opportunity and ability to use the \n12 \nmeans or instrumentalities to cause death or serious physical injury.\" \n \n13  32. Thus, while citizens are clearly allowed to act in self-defense based on \n14  mistaken perceptions as long they had a reasonable belief in the 'apparent \n15  danger' confronting them at the time of the incident, SPD officers now can \nonly use deadly force, without exception, if the threat IS (not \"reasonably \n16 \nappears\") imminent, \"AND\" (not \"or\") the suspect IS (not \"reasonably \n17 \nappears\") to be acting or threatening to cause death or serious physical \n18 \ninjury; \"AND\" (not \"or\") the suspect HAS (not \"appears to have\") the means \n19 \nor instrumentalities to do so;  AND (not \"or\") the subject HAS (not \"appears \n20 \nto have\") the opportunity and ability to cause the harm.  Under the UF \n21 \nPolicy, an officer must put his or her own life at risk if not absolutely \n22  sure of the suspect's ability to kill or harm, or the officer can risk \n23  losing his or her job by using reasonable, though mistaken, force in self-\ndefense.  Such a draconian choice clearly burdens the constitutional right \n24 \nof self-defense to the point of destruction.  \n25 \n33. As another example, the policy requires that force cannot be used against \n26 \nhandcuffed suspects without \"exceptional circumstances,\" and then such use \n27 \nof force will be \"closely and critically reviewed.\" (ยง8.100.2)  Specific \n28 \npreconditions for particular categories or situations involving force limit \n \n11 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 12 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nan officerโs options for reasonably responding to threatening and dangerous \n1 \nbehavior by suspects.  All that matters is whether the officer's actions \n2 \nwere reasonable.   \n3 \n34. The right of self-defense means that the appearance of an immediate threat \n4  justifies an immediate response with reasonable force.   This means officers \n5  must be permitted to avail themselves of the full range of reasonable force \n6  options in the face of threatening behavior.   \n35. Yet core provisions authorizing force consistently restrict this. For \n7 \nexample, sections 8.000.4 and 8.100.1 categorically prohibit an officer from \n8 \nusing physical force unless, in addition to being reasonable, the force also \n9 \nis necessary - which means the officer has first considered and eliminated \n10 \nall apparent \"reasonably effective alternatives.\"  Such a requirement has \n11 \nbeen specifically rejected as an impossible standard by the Ninth Circuit.   \n12 \n36. The policy also announces a wholly new requirement that, in addition to \n13  being reasonable and necessary, the force used be \"proportional\" and \n14  \"proportionate\" (ยงยง 8.000.4, 8.100.1).  These extra-constitutional \n15  requirements add precision and complexity to a standard that the Court \ndemands be simple, flexible, and reasonable, for the safety of officers and \n16 \nthe public.   \n17 \n37. Sec. 8.100.1 states that: \"proportional force does not require officers to \n18 \nuse the same type or amount of force as the subject.\"  While this appears to \n19 \nallow an officer to retain discretion regarding the amount of force he or \n20 \nshe judges appropriate to the circumstances, any such deference is \n21 \nconsistently and overwhelmingly contradicted by operation of other parts of \n22  the policy.  For example, officer discretion is overridden by the policy's \n23  requirement that use of force \"shall\" in all cases be \"only...to the degree\" \nnecessary (ยงยง 8.000.4, 8.100.1) Moreover, officers are required \n24 \nunrealistically to \"continually assess the situation\" and then continually \n25 \n\"modulate the use of force\" in response (ยง 8.000.3), during incidents in \n26 \nwhich the Court acknowledges objective reflection is an impractical and \n27 \nunrealistic expectation.   \n28 \n \n12 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 13 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n38. The policy explicitly overrides officer discretion by limiting officers' \n1 \nright to use certain levels and types of force - even in immediately \n2 \nthreatening situations - unless a variety of other factors, conditions, \n3 \nqualifiers are, or are not, present. (ยงยง 8.100.2, 8.100.5, 8.200.5) The real \n4  effect of the policy is to keep patrol officers constantly second-guessing \n5  their actions, meanwhile remaining at a dangerous force deficit throughout \n6  encounters with threatening suspects.  \n39. Sec.8.200.5, categorically and without exception, prohibits officers from \n7 \nusing less-lethal tools against five (5) vaguely defined, newly protected \n8 \nclasses of suspects (visibly pregnant, elderly, pre-adolescent, visibly \n9 \nfrail, or known or suspected to be disabled) absent active aggression, \n10 \nunless deadly force is the only other available option.  These five \n11 \ncategories are sufficiently broad, subjective and vague so as to encompass a \n12 \nbroad swath of individuals and to invite significant error in application \n13  and improper second-guessing.   Moreover, by operation of this rule, an \n14  officer cannot use reasonable and effective force tools or techniques (i.e. \n15  tools and techniques specifically intended to \"disrupt subject's threatening \nbehavior\" without the probability of death or serious physical injury) until \n16 \ndeadly force is justified.  This makes no sense as a matter of public \n17 \npolicy.  It also unreasonably burdens officers' right to defense of self and \n18 \nothers because it prohibits officers from responding with reasonable force \n19 \nfrom the moment they arrive on the scene. \n20 \n40. Sec. 8.200.5 categorically restricts an officer from using these less-lethal \n21 \ntools and techniques against suspects in another nine (9) sets of \n22  circumstances absent active aggression.  This means the suspect can be \n23  actually resisting, or actively noncompliant with an officer's commands - an \nimportant potential indication of an intent to do harm to the officer - yet \n24 \nthe officer cannot, without exception, respond with less-lethal techniques \n25 \nbefore considering and rejecting \"any other fashion\" of reasonable response, \n26 \ne.g. the impossible \"all other alternatives\" standard.  \n27 \n41. The UF Policy consistently requires officers first to consider alternatives \n28 \nto force.  These are strict mandates: Sec 8.100.3 uses \"shall\" four separate \n \n13 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 14 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \ntimes (e.g. ยง 8.100.3 \"officers shall use de-escalation tactics in order to \n1 \nreduce the need for force;\" see also ยง 8.000.2 \"officers will de-escalate \n2 \nconflict without using physical force.\")  The policy attempts to qualify \n3 \nthese rigid preconditions in order to make them seem reasonable, e.g. \n4  stating that de-escalation is required \"when safe and feasible.\"  Such \n5  qualifiers, however, work only to add complexity and precision to a policy \n6  that is already dangerously unwieldy and virtually impossible to follow.   \nIn ยง 8.100.3 alone, officers, at the same time as deciding if it is \"safe,\" \n7 \nare required (\"shall\") to \"slow down or stabilize the situation\" (ยถ 2), even \n8 \nas they are conducting the required assessment (\"shall consider\") of the \n9 \nsuspect's mental health (ยถ 3).  Such information \"shall then be balanced\" \n10 \nagainst \"the facts of the incident\" before deciding on the \"most \n11 \nappropriate,\" i.e. the one, 'best' tactical option (ยถ 4).  This requires \n12 \nsuperhuman skills in any situation, but clearly is impossible under the \n13  potentially dangerous, rapidly unfolding circumstances facing officers.  \n14  42. The qualifiers also disguise how the policy, taken together as a whole, is \n15  out-and-out wrong.  Specifically, officers are told to delay only \"when time \nand circumstances permit.\"  In the very same provision, however, officers \n16 \nare required to do the exact opposite and take unreasonable risks.  This is \n17 \nbecause officers are required to delay and not use force even though (1) \n18 \nsafety has already been compromised by the subject's lack of compliance \n19 \n(i.e. under ยง 8.100.3 officers consider not if the subject is non-compliant, \n20 \nbut the reasons for the suspect's \"lack of compliance\"); and (2) there is an \n21 \nimmediate threat (โmitigating the existing immediacy of a threatโ is the \n22  assumed situation when these rules apply). \n23  43. The UF Policy operates under a mistaken and dangerous assumption that \nthreatening situations always move in a linear, predictable direction.  It \n24 \nassumes that de-escalation will inevitably result in a reduction of the use \n25 \nof force, because additional \"time available\" will \"promote more rational \n26 \ndecision-making\" by suspects, and allow \"more officers or specialty units\" \n27 \nto respond to the scene (ยง 8.100.3 para 5). This policy direction comes \n28 \ndirectly from DOJ's findings letter where it criticizes SPD's training of \n \n14 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 15 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nits officers to quickly \"command and control\" situations, proposing instead \n1 \nthat SPD require its officers to engage in a 'fair fight' with suspects. \n2 \nOfficers' right to self-defense, however, certainly does not depend on ill-\n3 \nconceived assumptions that suspected criminals will fight fair, or behave \n4  rationally, or that it's always better to wait for the \"specialists.\"  \n5  44. The de-escalation provisions improperly mandate that an officer's UF \n6  decisions take into account the suspect's mental and physical state, even \nwhere the suspect is actively non-compliant (ยง 8.100.3). Furthermore, the \n7 \nTool Specific provisions categorically tie an officer's hands in cases \n8 \ninvolving five categories of actively threatening suspects based on physical \n9 \nand/or mental conditions (ยง 8.200.5).  In essence, the policy categorically \n10 \ndefines as \"excessive\" force used against such persons even when they \n11 \npresent a serious threat.  This is, of course, DOJ's and Mr. Bobb's real \n12 \ngoal.  As DOJ states in its findings letters, \"Assessing the appropriate \n13  force in light of a subject's mental state is not just smart policing, it is \n14  required.\"  This position, however, is fundamentally in conflict with the \n15  law of self-defense.  The crucial factor in deciding whether or not \nexcessive force was used is the nature and immediacy of the threat.  The \n16 \nConstitution does not allow second-guessing of an officerโs reasonable \n17 \ndecisions, even if the officer failed to diagnose mental illness, because \n18 \nrequiring otherwise is impractical and dangerous. \n19 \n45. Consider just one of the factors officers must \"consider\" and then \"balance\" \n20 \nin order to make \"the most appropriate,\" i.e. 'best', tactical decision: \n21 \nwhether or not the suspect is experiencing a \"drug interaction.\"  Police \n22  officers are not medical or mental health professionals.  It can take \n23  doctors and mental health professionals months or years to figure out a \npatient's diagnosis, drug interactions, and appropriate means of \n24 \ncommunication, therapy, and treatment.  Yet the UF Policy requires police \n25 \nofficers to make on-the-spot mental health evaluations and diagnoses under \n26 \ncircumstances that will, by definition (because this section of the policy \n27 \nassumes the suspect's \"lack of compliance\"), be threatening, volatile, and \n28 \npotentially dangerous or deadly.  Such requirements are unreasonable and \n \n15 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 16 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \ninterfere with an officers' ability to promptly take reasonable actions in \n1 \nself-defense. \n2 \n46. Throughout its findings letter, DOJ substitutes its judgments about erratic \n3 \nand non-compliant behavior by suspects for the judgments of SPD patrol \n4  officers on the scene and facing the threat.  Behavior that DOJ \n5  categorically defines - well after the fact and from the safety of its \n6  offices - as the benign effects of mental illness (yelling expletives at \noneself, staring into space, bulging eyes, sweating, balled fists, \n7 \ndisregarding or refusing officer commands, taking off pieces of clothing), \n8 \ncan be understood, based on an officer's specialized training and real world \n9 \nexperience, as evidence of Excited Delirium, \"boiling point,\" and/or pre-\n10 \nattack indicators, i.e. evidence that a suspect's behavior is likely to \n11 \nbecome violent and rapidly escalate his or her attack on officers or the \n12 \npublic.  Officers' training and experience demonstrate a strong correlation \n13  between mental illness and the use and abuse of drugs.  Drug abuse, in turn, \n14  is strongly correlated with violent behavior, and experience has shown that \n15  such suspects do not respond to usual norms of behavior as suggested by \nDOJ's de-escalation requirements.  The right of self-defense does not permit \n16 \njudges, DOJ, or the Monitor, looking back in perfect hindsight to second-\n17 \nguess what patrol officers know from experience, and confront in the moment. \n18 \n47. The Constitution and principles of self-defense demand that standards for UF \n19 \ndecision-making, like those for all seizures, be fluid, flexible, practical, \n20 \nsimple, clear, non-technical, and based on common sense, i.e. useful to the \n21 \nofficer in his or her work on the street, even if not necessarily the type \n22  of neat, categorical rules preferred by legal professionals in the safety of \n23  their chambers and offices.  Overly proscriptive rules can never substitute \nfor flexibility and deference to experience, as there is nothing predictable \n24 \nabout what a patrol officer faces when he or she responds to a volatile \n25 \ncall, and every 911 call has the potential to turn harmful or deadly.  Yet, \n26 \nDOJ and the Monitor have forced the City into a policy that is complicated, \n27 \nrigid, technical, impractical and allows for no mistakes. It is a policy \n28 \ncomprised of mandatory \"shall\"s and \"shall not\"s despite the fact that in \n \n16 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 17 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nthe Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to UF policy and practices \n1 \n\"consistent with Graham v Connor,\" and \"guided by\" principles carefully \n2 \nwritten with \"should\"s and \"may\"s so that any resulting policy would \n3 \nmaintain officer flexibility and discretion, as well as prioritize officer \n4  safety and the need for \"staying in control.\" (Settlement Agreement, Sec. \n5  III. A. ยถ. 70, pp.16 and 17; see also Sec. II, ยถ. 58, p 14: Defining \n6  \"'shall' or 'will' to mean that the provision imposes a mandatory duty; \n'should' does not indicate a mandatory duty.\").  \n7 \n48. A policy cannot be useful to patrol officers facing dangers and making \n8 \nsplit-second decisions when the required reading is 50 pages long!  (23 \n9 \npages of core principles, definitions, prohibitions, and specific rules for \n10 \neach force tool; 17 pages of more specific definitions, and rules regarding \n11 \nwhen and how officers should respond with and report use of force, and an \n12 \nadditional 10 pages regarding UF reports and review).  There is also a new \n13  (as yet incomplete) 50-page procedural manual that is required reading for \n14  those who investigate use of force.  \n15  49. A Policy cannot be useful when it is blatantly contradictory from its \nopening paragraph. Seattle police officers must accomplish their mission \n16 \nwith 'minimal reliance' on force, but at the same time, if they 'fail to use \n17 \ntimely and adequate force' they fail at their job. (ยง 8.000.1). The only way \n18 \nto reconcile these opposing goals is to assume the impossible: that police \n19 \nofficers can act in a precise and perfect fashion despite dangerous, \n20 \nuncertain, and rapidly unfolding circumstances. \n21  50. The policy deceptively states the totality of the circumstances standard \n22  correctly (ยง 8.100.1 ยถ 4), but then operates to entirely undermine that \n23  standard.  It promulgates a set of 12 separate, multi-layered, non-exclusive \nfactors that must be considered by the officer to determine reasonableness. \n24 \n(Graham lists three.)  It then requires officers to also apply two extra-\n25 \nconstitutional requirements (necessity and proportionality).  It establishes \n26 \nfive situations in which force is categorically prohibited (Sec. 8.100.2).  \n27 \nIn addition, the officer must consider another seven, non-exclusive factors \n28 \n \n17 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 18 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nrelated to a suspect's mental and physical behavior that must be \"balanced\" \n1 \nin an officer's decision-making process regarding force (ยง 8.100.3  4).   \n2 \n51. If the policy is not to be an exercise in second-guessing, as it purports \n3 \nnot to be, these 26 factors, requirements and situations all must be \n4  considered and evaluated, and the officer's response must be calibrated \n5  accordingly, in the \"split second\" the officer has to make the decision \n6  whether or not to use force in the face of threatening behavior.  This is an \nimpossible task. Thus, these 26 factors, requirements, and situations are in \n7 \nreality meant only to provide the means for unconstitutional, after-the-\n8 \nfact, second-guessing of officer decision-making.  \n9 \n52. Moreover, this scheme replaces the longstanding reasonableness standard -- \n10 \none that grants officer's latitude and discretion based upon training, \n11 \nexperience, knowledge of the area and suspects, the uncertainty and fast-\n12 \npace of police encounters, and recognition that the officer's own life is \n13  often on the line -- with a 'categorical,' pre-set, 'neat set' of rules that \n14  officers should apply precisely, mechanically, and without need or room for \n15  mistakes. \n53. The clear, though incorrect, implication of the UF Policy is that any use of force \n16 \nrequires heightened justification beyond what would be a reasonable response to the \n17 \nsituation.  Officers historically have been carefully trained to evaluate grounds \n18 \nfor reasonable suspicion and probable cause, but under the new UF Policy now \n19 \nhesitate and delay in order to find some special, policy-specific grounds to \n20 \njustify force - and run through all the categories of suspects granted special \n21 \nprotection under the policy to make sure force is not used against them - even as \n22  they face a threat of serious harm.  All this defies reason, common sense, and \n23  officers' right of self-defense. \n54. This multi-layered and multi-factored analysis addresses only the initial \n24 \nquestion of whether or not force can be used.  The officer must then \n25 \nconsider his or her prior conduct to determine the level of force he or she \n26 \nis permitted to use (ยง 8.000.3), and assess whether or not a suspect falls \n27 \ninto any of five categories before being permitted to use a certain level of \n28 \nforce (ยง 8.200.5).   After engaging in that fraught-with-potential-for-error \n \n18 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 19 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nassessment, the officer must also know and factor in another 13 pages of \n1 \ndetailed rules regarding ten specific force tools and techniques (ยงยง 8.200-\n2 \nPOL-1-10). \n3 \n55. The policy contains yet another complicated, mechanical scheme related to \n4  the reporting and investigation of UF incidents.  It defines four separate \n5  categories of types of force (ยง 8.050). In addition, it creates a four-part \n6  classification of types of injuries (ยง 8.050).  Finally, it has the detailed \nrules for ten specific force tools (ยง8.200-POL-1-10). Under ยง 8.300-POL-1, \n7 \nthe policy then establishes a complex system combining type of force, type \n8 \nof injury, and type of force tool to create different categories of \n9 \nreporting requirements for officers and screening requirements for \n10 \nsupervisors.  The policy also requires that officers justify each and every \n11 \nseparate force application, see e.g., ยงยง 8.200-POL-1.11; 8.200-POL-3.9; \n12 \n8.200-POL-5.6; 8.200-POL-6.5. Accordingly, officers are unreasonably \n13  required to understand this complex system of definitions and reporting even \n14  as they need to make UF decisions in the face of suspects' immediately \n15  threatening behavior. \n56. The factors that the officer uses to justify, and that supervisors, \n16 \ncommanders, and citizens use to review, use of force must be the same \n17 \nfactors the officer uses to actually make his force decisions on the scene.  \n18 \nIf factors are too complicated and contradictory to facilitate reasonable \n19 \ndecisions in the heat of the moment, they cannot be used, after-the-fact, to \n20 \ninvalidate the officer's judgment and conduct as he or she faced an \n21 \nimmediate threat. Yet clearly this is what is mandated by the reporting and \n22  review provisions of the policy.   \n23  57. The UF Policy requires a moment-by-moment analysis both of the officer's \nconduct leading up to the UF, and a point-by-point, post-hoc critique of the \n24 \nincident.  These work together to invalidate the totality standard's focus \n25 \non the circumstances confronting the officer at the moment force was used.   \n26 \n58. Patrol officers are warned that \"their conduct prior to the use of force\" \n27 \ncan be a factor in determining whether or not the subsequent use of force \n28 \nwas necessary (ignoring that the constitutional test is \"reasonableness\")  \n \n19 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 20 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n(ยง 8.000.3).  They must also \"continually\" assess and modulate their use of \n1 \nforce. This means SPD officer's conduct will be measured as to whether at \n2 \neach and every point he or she made the \"most appropriate,\" i.e. 'best', \n3 \nmost correct, decision.  If not, the officers' subsequent, reasonable use of \n4  force is called into question. This conflicts with the reasonableness \n5  standard because reconsideration will nearly always reveal that something \n6  different could have been done.  Even evidence of bad tactical decisions \nleading up to a use of force does not deprive officers of the subsequent \n7 \nright to use reasonable defensive force. \n8 \n59. Under the UF Policy an officer's \"display of a weapon\" can be used against \n9 \nthe officer in evaluating any subsequent use of force.  This unreasonably \n10 \nburdens the right of self-defense and makes no sense to the reality of the \n11 \nofficer's experience.  Officers routinely have their firearms out and at the \n12 \nready when, for example, they search and clear a building or approach \n13  suspects during high-risk vehicle stops.  In such cases, the threat is the \n14  uncertainty, and officers need, and have the right, to be armed and ready \n15  because they are always behind the reactionary curve of a potential suspect \nwho has decided to shoot, stab, slash, or smash as a means of resistance or \n16 \nescape.  \n17 \n60. The UF Policy's requirement of moment-by-moment justification of precisely \n18 \nthe correct amount of force means that officers will feel compelled to de-\n19 \nescalate \"immediately\" after using reasonable force without adequately \n20 \nassessing whether or not the threat has in fact been eliminated.  Evidence \n21 \nfrom UF reports under the new UF Policy confirms officers are rushing to \n22  immediate de-escalation without any assessment of whether the threat of \n23  danger has been realistically eliminated. \n61. Officers are required to \"justify\" and \"report\" each separate use of a less \n24 \nlethal device during a single incident, including that \"each subsequent \n25 \napplication of force is a separate application of force that must be \n26 \nindividually justified.\"  (ยงยง 8.200-POL-1-10).  Officers are also required \n27 \nto document, and supervisors are required to review, in all but de minimis \n28 \nforce, each and every blow or application of force.  (Sec. 8.300-POL-1, \n \n20 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 21 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n8.300-POL-1.1)  This creates an impermissible \"divide and conquer\" or \n1 \n\"segmented approach\" to UF decision-making.  Plaintiffs know from DOJ's \n2 \nfindings in its similar review of use of force by the Portland Police Bureau \n3 \nthat DOJ explicitly advocates a constitutionally flawed \"segmented approach\" \n4  to use of force claims.  DOJ and the Monitor demand that supervisors \n5  consider, after-the-fact, \"each point when an officer made a decision that \n6  may have an effect on subsequent events,\" to allow \"intensive,\" post-hoc \nreviews in order to identify โflawed tactical decisions.\"  Thus, in DOJ's \n7 \nown words, it is admitting that it intends to promote UF reviews expressly \n8 \ndesigned to lead to unconstitutional second-guessing.  To properly analyze \n9 \nconduct taken in self-defense, an officer's use of force must be reviewed as \n10 \na continuous event until the threat is decisively stopped, and an officer's \n11 \njudgment and actions must be assessed cumulatively, i.e. as a whole picture \n12 \ntaken together, without imposing a sequencing of distinct events in order to \n13  poke holes and find flaws or to invalidate specific elements of an officer's \n14  cumulative judgment. The analysis must conform to the reality that officers \n15  need to make split-second decisions under dangerous, rapidly unfolding \ncircumstances. \n16 \n62. The policy divides force into qualitatively separate and distinct types \n17 \n(e.g. ยง 8.050).  The categorical force type is then applied mechanically for \n18 \npurposes of both an officer's decision, and SPD's and the City's after-the-\n19 \nfact analysis and review, to determine whether or not the officer should be \n20 \ndisciplined and/or criminally charged for the UF.  Such a mechanical scheme \n21 \ndefining and categorizing levels of force is an attempt to impose a \"force \n22  continuum\" on SPD officers.  Requiring officers to pigeon-hole force types \n23  before, during, and after their decision to use force, complicates and \nhampers their ability to respond to the particular circumstances they face.  \n24 \nIt also implies that mechanical decisions can always be made regarding when \n25 \nand what force is reasonably required to meet a suspect's threatening \n26 \nbehavior and/or resistance. Plaintiffs know from experience this is never \n27 \ntrue. Not surprisingly, continuums and mechanical schemes have been \n28 \ndiscredited by law enforcement experts, even those in other departments of \n \n21 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 22 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nthe DOJ itself, as unconstitutional and promoting dangerous, ineffective \n1 \npolicing.  \n2 \nIII.  CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS \n3 \nA.  By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have \nviolated Plaintiffs' Constitutional Right of Self-Defense. \n4   \n63.  When a police officer is confronted with threatening behavior, he or she \n5 \nhas the right to take reasonable actions in defense of self and others.  \n6 \nPlaintiffs' right of self-defense is 'fundamental,' 'basic,' 'natural,' \n7 \n'central,' and 'inherent.'  For well over a century, the Court has held that \n8 \nthe right of self-defense existed prior to, and did not depend upon being \n9  granted by, the Constitution.  It is an individual right of \"universal \n10  application\" that is in no way diminished because Plaintiffs have chosen to \nbe police officers.  The right to use force in self-defense is an immediate \n11 \nright based on the immediacy of the threat or danger.  The right recognizes \n12 \na continuity of action such that officers can employ any and all reasonable \n13 \nmeans until the perceived threat has been fully extinguished. An essential \n14 \nattribute of this right is that it does not turn on the facts and \n15 \ncircumstances determined afterwards, but instead on whether or not there \n16 \nwere reasonable grounds for a person's belief that he or she was in imminent \n17  or immediate danger at the moment of the incident.  Detached reflection \n18  cannot be demanded in the presence of an immediate threat of serious \n19  physical harm.  The above allegations provide multiple examples of the \nspecific ways the UF Policy violates these long-standing standards that \n20 \nensure the individual's right of self-defense. The UF Policy then not only \n21 \ninvites but demands unconstitutional second-guessing of UF decisions. \n22 \nB.  By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have \n23  violated the Second Amendment. \n \n64. The fundamental right to self-defense \"pre-exists\" and is broader than the \n24 \nspecific Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, although it is \n25 \nembodied in and is the central component of this right. Therefore, \n26 \nDefendants actions in unreasonably restricting and burdening Plaintiffs \n27 \nright of self-defense violate the Second Amendment.  Moreover, the contours \n28 \nof Plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights shape an appropriate understanding of \n \n22 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 23 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \ntheir broader constitutional right to self-defense.  The right to keep and \n1 \nbear arms is a right that is exercised individually and belongs to each and \n2 \nevery American citizen, regardless of profession, and is not limited to use \n3 \nof an officer's firearm.  The right has been understood not merely as the \n4  right to use force after a confrontation has occurred but includes the right \n5  to be prepared or ready in case of the possibility of a conflict or \n6  confrontation with an assailant.  Plaintiffs recognize that these rights are \nnot unlimited and can be subject to legitimate and appropriate regulation.  \n7 \nNevertheless, the specific right to keep and bear arms is an 'enshrinement' \n8 \nof a fundamental right to self-defense, which means that regulations cannot \n9 \nburden such rights to the point of destruction, or render them practically \n10 \nmeaningless.  As the above allegations make clear, decision-making under the \n11 \nUF Policy is sufficiently proscribed so that police officers cannot act \n12 \ndecisively in the moment, based on an assessment of the threat, to bring \n13  situations under control in order to protect themselves and others from \n14  harm.  \n15  65. Plaintiffs know their job puts them in danger.  They accept these risks in \nlarge part because their job also allows them the privilege to serve and \n16 \nprotect the innocent.  Plaintiffs are not arguing that the Constitution \n17 \ngrants them the right to dictate all the terms of a UF Policy or requires \n18 \nthe City to keep them safe at all times.  The Constitution, however, \n19 \nprovides Plaintiffs the fundamental right of self-defense.  The City cannot \n20 \nmake policy decisions and impose policy requirements that consistently and \n21 \ninevitably place them at unnecessary and, therefore, unreasonable risk when \n22  confronting dangerous suspects.  Such policy choices have been taken off the \n23  table by the law. \nC.  By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have \n24 \nviolated the Fourth Amendment. \n \n25 \n66. The Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is the core guide \n26  regarding police interactions with persons engaged, or suspected of \n27  engagement, in criminal activity.  It contains clear and long-standing \n28  standards and principles regarding seizures.  Plaintiffs argue that when \n \n23 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 24 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nthey are unnecessarily required to face death or serious injury in such \n1 \nencounters, because of the policies of their employer, they have been \n2 \nintentionally and unreasonably seized in violation of their Fourth Amendment \n3 \nrights.  A policy with these identified dangers does not simply create the \n4  random chance of harm to the officer, it makes it a virtual certainty due to \n5  the nature of the job itself and the fact that the government requires them \n6  to perform it under the flawed UF Policy each and every day. \nD. By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have \n7 \nviolated the Plaintiffs' Right of Self-Defense as Embedded in the Fourth \nAmendment. \n8 \n \n67. Without finding a specific Fourth Amendment seizure of officers harmed because of \n9 \nthe UF Policy, long-standing Fourth Amendment case law still embeds and recognizes \n10 \na police officer's fundamental right of self-defense.  Even as it balances \n11 \ngovernments' versus citizens' interests, the Court finds a separate, more \n12 \nfundamental and pre-existing right at play, viz. officers' right to take necessary \n13  and reasonable steps to secure their own safety and that of bystanders when \n14  conducting a seizure: in short, defense of self and others.  For \"certainly it \n15  would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the \nperformance of their duties.\" The Court has made clear that officers do not have to \n16 \nfirst take a chance on arguably less intrusive measures and 'hope for the best.'  \n17 \nAs the Fourth Circuit put it succinctly, \"The Constitution simply does not require \n18 \npolice to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm.\" This is \n19 \nnot a hollow right to recover damages (or for officers' widows and children to \n20 \nrecover such) after they have been seriously or fatally injured.  The \n21 \nconstitutional injury occurs regardless of whether or not a police officer happens \n22  to be lucky enough to avoid, or to protect himself or herself from, actual harm in \n23  the face of danger.  Instead, the right of self-defense by necessity means that the \nCity cannot unreasonably restrict or burden the timing and/or range of reasonable \n24 \noptions officers may employ in protecting themselves and others.  \"It would be \n25 \nclearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures in \n26 \norder to neutralize the threat of physical harm.\" \n27 \n68. In determining whether or not there was unnecessary and therefore unreasonable risk \n28 \nto the officer's safety, the Court examines whether or not the officer was \n \n24 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 25 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n'justified,' in other words, reasonable, in his or her belief regarding the present \n1 \nthreat of danger.  This is also the single most important factor in the objective \n2 \nreasonableness standard under the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, the totality of the \n3 \ncircumstances standard teaches us about officers' right of self-defense. The Court \n4  has been careful not to permit Fourth Amendment standards that invite recklessness \n5  or create perverse incentives for criminal suspects to disregard public safety any \n6  further than they already do.  The Court requires that every police encounter, from \nsocial contact through the use of deadly force, be judged by one, consistent, long-\n7 \nstanding standard: reasonableness. There is no 'magic on/off switch' or 'rigid \n8 \npreconditions' for when, or what type of, force is appropriate in a particular \n9 \ncase.  \"All that matters is whether the officer's actions were reasonable.\"  For \n10 \nthe same reason, the Court rejects application of separate tracks or categorical \n11 \nrules when evaluating an officerโs conduct in relation to a mentally ill suspect, \n12 \nor one of any other category.  Even as courts, including the Ninth Circuit, \n13  complain of its \"troubling degree of uncertainty,\" the Court consistently rejects \n14  attempts at producing a neat set of rules.  Instead, the actual, cumulative \n15  information available to the officer on the scene, combined with his own experience \nand specialized training, always trumps pre-set rules, categorical schemes, or use \n16 \nof post-hoc 'divide and conquerโ analysis of the officer's decision.  As the above \n17 \nallegations demonstrate, the UF Policy, throughout, contradicts these standards of \n18 \nreasonableness, flexibility and deference, instead restricting and burdening \n19 \nPlaintiffs' right of self-defense.   \n20 \nE.  By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n21 \n \n69. The UF Policy rewards suspects' recklessness and disregard for the safety of others \n22 \nas it consistently disadvantages officers in the face of volatile, unpredictable, \n23 \nthreatening behavior by suspects.  The UF Policy thus places Plaintiffs at \n24 \nconsiderable disadvantage compared to suspects and the general public as regards \n25 \ntheir fundamental right to defend themselves from threats of deadly harm and \n26  serious bodily injury.  This denies Plaintiffs the equal protection of the law as \n27  prohibited by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have \n28  asserted a fundamental constitutional right of self-defense and Defendants have not \n \n25 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 26 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nasserted a justification sufficient to satisfy the heightened scrutiny required by \n1 \nequal protection law. \n2 \nF.  By Promulgating and Implementing the UF Policy, Defendants have violated \nPlaintiffs' Substantive and Procedural Due Process under the Fifth and \n3 \nFourteenth Amendments. \n \n4  70. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a federal agency, such as \n5  DOJ, from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without the due \n6  process of law.  Similarly, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nprohibits state actors from doing the same.  Clearly such rights are at stake here.  \n7 \nPlaintiffs allege that the UF Policy subjects them to unnecessary risk of death and \n8 \nserious bodily injury.  Plaintiffs believe we will face unreasonable disciplinary \n9 \nactions, lawsuits, loss of employment, and the inability to obtain police \n10 \nemployment in other jurisdictions if and when we are accused of violating the new \n11 \nUF Policy, even though our actions were reasonable under the law.   \n12 \n71. Substantive due process claims have been brought by suspects alleging excessive use \n13  of force by the government in cases where the suspect cannot establish that there \n14  has been an intentional seizure by the government.   These cases, though brought by \n15  suspects, reflect the underlying, embedded right of self-defense of the police \nofficer involved and, thus, shed light on the contours of Plaintiffs' right of \n16 \nself-defense.   Thus, for example, rules of due process, like the reasonableness \n17 \nstandard, cannot be subject to mechanical application and must take into account \n18 \nthat officers often will not have the luxury to make unhurried judgments.  \n19 \nMoreover, evaluation of officer conduct must consider that officers often need to \n20 \nact quickly even as decision-making is complicated by pulls of competing \n21 \nobligations, i.e. the need to act decisively and to show restraint at the same \n22  moment.  All of these realities are relevant to evaluating an officer's conduct \n23  when his or her actions are taken in response to suspect's threatening behavior.  \nNone of these realities are reflected in the UF Policy.   \n24 \n72. Due process however is not only for the benefit of suspects.  Plaintiffs assert a \n25 \nsubstantive due process violation of our own liberty and property interests.  \n26 \nRegardless of whether or not Plaintiffs can establish that the policy's \n27 \nrestrictions and burdens are a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, DOJ's and the \n28 \nCity's deliberate indifference to long-standing rights of self-defense, as they \n \n26 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 27 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nforce Plaintiffs to conform to a policy that blatantly violates those rights, is an \n1 \nabuse of power that shocks the conscience.  Defendants know that the policy is \n2 \nfundamentally flawed and puts public safety and officers' lives in jeopardy, yet \n3 \nthey still refuse to change it because it would be 'too hard' politically.   Other \n4  Defendants show callous and aggressive disregard when confronted with evidence of \n5  the threat to public and officer safety created by the UF Policy.   It is \n6  unconscionable and an abuse of authority when, in light of such evidence, those in \npower are permitted to equate public safety concerns with buying \"Cheerios\" in a \n7 \n\"grocery store.\"  \n8 \n73. DOJ has imposed, and the City and SPD have acquiesced in, a fundamental rewriting \n9 \nof nearly universal, long-standing, constitutionally-grounded rules of reasonable \n10 \npolice conduct based on a secretive and fundamentally flawed factual analysis.  \n11 \nThis violates both substantive and procedural due process. DOJ repeatedly refused \n12 \nto provide the City, SPD or the public with the data, methods, or analysis it used \n13  to reach its conclusions.  The little information DOJ did provide indicates that \n14  its key finding comes from an extrapolation from a random sample of UF reports.  It \n15  is therefore nothing more than speculation.  An independent and complete analysis \nby researchers under the supervision of Matthew Hickman, a Professor at Seattle \n16 \nUniversity, and a former statistician for DOJ itself found that only 3.5% of cases \n17 \ncould be characterized as even \"potentially\" excessive.  In addition, DOJ's finding \n18 \nregarding the prevalence of excessive force directly conflicts with other key \n19 \nfindings by DOJ, such as, the โgreat majorityโ of Seattleโs police officers do not \n20 \nuse excessive force; the pattern of excessive force exists only for a very small \n21 \nโsubsetโ of officers; and that supervisory oversight should focus only on the โvery \n22  small numberโ of officers who use force frequently. \n23  74. Defendants have imposed the new UF Policy without providing Plaintiffs any \nmeaningful opportunity to be heard, even though it is their safety and livelihood \n24 \nthat is most significantly and immediately affected by the policy changes.  They \n25 \ndid so without meaningful consultation with or involvement from SPOG.  They did so \n26 \nnotwithstanding that many SPD patrol officers are recognized experts in the field \n27 \nof use of force standards and techniques. They ignored Plaintiffs' experience and \n28 \nexpertise, even as the constitutional standard at issue - whether the police \n \n27 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 28 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \nofficersโ conduct was objectively reasonable - depends on an examination of the \n1 \nspecific knowledge, experience, training and circumstances facing those officers.  \n2 \nMost significantly, Defendants continued even more aggressively to cut Plaintiffs \n3 \nout of the process as they raised the most serious of concerns: that the new policy \n4  puts their lives and the lives of citizens in danger. \n5  IV. HARM CAUSED AND RELIEF SOUGHT \n6  75. The dangers and harm cited by Plaintiffs are real, not conjectural.  The \nconstitutional right of self-defense includes the right not to be required to take \n7 \nunnecessary and therefore unreasonable risks with Plaintiffsโ safety and the safety \n8 \nof the public.  The unnecessary and unreasonable risk required by the UF Policy is \n9 \nitself the injury.  It is unconstitutional to require Plaintiffs to \"gamble with \n10 \ntheir lives.\"   \n11 \n76. While the actual UF Policy has only been in place since January 2014, the standards \n12 \nreflected in it have been imposed by DOJ since it issued its findings letter on \n13  December 16, 2011, and quickly became the pattern and practice of what has been \n14  required of patrol officers since that time. \n15  77. Plaintiffs seek an immediate injunction against the implementation of SPD's UF \nPolicy that went into effect on January 1, 2014, and all related training.  The \n16 \nimmediacy of this injunction is crucial in light of Plaintiffs' serious and \n17 \nsignificant allegations regarding the unconstitutionality of the UF Policy, and the \n18 \ndangers it creates to the safety of SPD patrol officers and the public. Moreover, \n19 \nsince the intrusion of DOJ in 2011, SPD patrol officers, including new officers at \n20 \nthe Academy (CJTC), have been improperly trained and conditioned to pause, \n21 \nhesitate, overthink and under-react in the face of threats of danger.  The longer \n22  this training/conditioning is ingrained, the harder it will be to undo, and the \n23  safety of officers and the public is further endangered for years, if not decades, \nto come. \n24 \n78. Plaintiffs further seek a declaratory judgment that the UF Policy is \n25 \nunconstitutional and beyond repair.   Plaintiffs seek a declaration requiring that \n26 \nan entirely new UF policy be drafted as soon as possible, but only after obtaining \n27 \nsubstantial input from Plaintiffs and other patrol officers with direct experience \n28 \nin appropriate use of force decision-making and tactics in Seattle. \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 13   Filed 08/27/14   Page 29 of 34\nThe Honorable Marsha J. Pechman \n79. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages for lost time and wages, improper disciplinary \n1 \naction, or any other personnel actions taken against Plaintiffs for violations of \n2 \nthe UF Policy where Plaintiffs acted based on their constitutional rights of self-\n3 \ndefense.  Plaintiffs seek punitive damages from Defendants based on Defendants' \n4  callous disregard and belittling of the genuine safety needs of SPD's patrol \n5  officers, as well as Defendants disregard for and rewriting of clearly established \n6  standards regarding use of force and concomitant disregard for the public's and \nPlaintiffs' safety.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages for the resources and \n7 \nfunds redirected away from the safety of patrol officers and the public and wasted \n8 \ninstead on the production of an unreasonable, unconstitutional UF Policy. \n9 \n80. Plaintiffs seek any other relief the court deems appropriate. \n10 \n81. Plaintiffs currently represent themselves pro se because of the overwhelming costs \n11 \nrelated to representation in a complex civil rights matter. Plaintiffs seek to \n12 \nobtain attorneysโ fees under 42 USC ยง 1988, and hope that due to the availability \n13  of attorneys fees they will be able to obtain in-state counsel to represent them in \n14  this court moving forward. \n15  82. Plaintiffs declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n16 \n \n17 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n18 \nDated this August 27, 2014 \n \n19 \nB y : s/ Sjon Stevens \n  Sjon Stevens (#6180)        \n20 \nPO Box 25274 \nSeattle, WA 98165 \n21  ufcomplaint@hotmail.com \ntel: (206) 684-0850 \n22   \n \n23   \n \n24  By: s/ Robert Mahoney  \nBy: s/ Cliff Borjeson  \n25  By: s/ Bridget Hillan  \nBy: s/ Lance Basney  \nBy: s/ Salvatore DiTusa  \n26 \nBy: s/ Clarke D.

C14-794 MJP \n11    Plaintiffs,  ORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n12    v. \n13  ERIC HOLDER et al., \n14    Defendants. \n \n15 \n16  THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendant Merrick Bobbโs Motion to \n17  Dismiss on quasi-judicial immunity grounds (Dkt. No. 19) and Defendants City of Seattle, \n18  Mayor Ed Murray, and City Attorney Peter Holmesโs Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a \n19  claim (Dkt. No. 25). Certain represented Plaintiffs responded to the Motions, while the \n20  remaining pro se Plaintiffs failed to respond. Having reviewed the motions, the Represented \n21  Plaintiffsโ Responses (Dkt. Nos. 36, 59), Defendant Bobbโs Reply (Dkt. No. 54), the City \n22  Defendantsโ Reply (Dkt. No. 62), and all related papers, the Court hereby GRANTS both \n23  Motions and DISMISSES the case with prejudice. \n24    \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 1 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 2 of 15\n \n \n \n1  Summary \n2    In this case, certain officers with the Seattle Police Department are challenging a Use of \n3  Force Policy adopted in response to an earlier lawsuit filed against the City of Seattle by the \n4  United States Department of Justice. In the earlier lawsuit, the Department of Justice claimed \n5  that the Seattle Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force. As a \n6  condition of settlement, the City of Seattle agreed to create new policies aimed at preventing this \n7  pattern from repeating. One of the key players in creating the Use of Force Policy was Merrick \n8  Bobb, a โMonitorโ appointed as an agent of the court to assist in the policy-drafting process, \n9  among other tasks. Although many groups gave feedback as the Use of Force Policy was being \n10  developed, individual officers of the Seattle Police Department were not a party to the lawsuit or \n11  the ensuing negotiations. \n12  The officers now argue the new Use of Force Policy violates their constitutional rights by \n13  constraining their options in defending themselves against potentially dangerous suspects. They \n14  also argue that the way the Use of Force Policy was drafted violates the Constitution. They ask \n15  the Court to stop the implementation of the Use of Force Policy, to declare the Use of Force \n16  Policy unconstitutional, and to award them money damages. \n17  As the Court explains in greater detail below, the officersโ constitutional arguments are \n18  not supported by the text of the Constitution or case law interpreting the Constitution. In \n19  addition, the officers cannot sue the court-appointed Monitor Merrick Bobb because he has \n20  โabsolute immunityโ from lawsuits relating to his actions assisting in the resolution of the earlier \n21  lawsuit. This immunity is known as โquasi-judicialโ because it is derived from the immunity \n22  given to judges, and Merrick Bobb is entitled to it both because he was appointed as an agent of \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 3 of 15\n \n \n \n1  a judge and because he was engaged in activities that parallel those of a judge. Because the \n2  officersโ case is not supported by the Constitution or case law, the Court dismisses the lawsuit. \n3  Background \n4  The Represented Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs representing themselves are police officers \n5  employed by the Seattle Police Department (โSPDโ) who have filed suit to challenge the Use of \n6  Force Policy (โPolicyโ) adopted by the City of Seattle (โCityโ) pursuant to a consent decree and \n7  settlement with the United States Department of Justice (โDOJโ). (Dkt. No. 13 at 3โ4; see Case \n8  No. C12-1282-JLR, United States v. City of Seattle.) In the first lawsuit, the Department of \n9  Justice claimed that after โan extensive investigation of the Seattle Police Department [ . . .], the \n10  United States [ ] determined that SPD engages in patterns or practices of using unlawful force \n11  that systematically deny the people of Seattle their constitutional rights.โ (Case No. C12-1282-\n12  JLR, Compl. & DOJ Report, Dkt. No. 1 at 2, cited in Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 13 at 3.) The \n13  settlement agreement and its central components, including the use of force policy it pledged to \n14  produce, had the โgoal of addressing the policies, procedures, training, and oversight that the \n15  United States alleges contributed to a pattern or practice of constitutional violations.โ (See Case \n16  No. C12-1282-JLR, Joint Motion and Proposed Order for Approval of Settlement Agreement, \n17  Dkt. No. 3 at 2โ3, cited in Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 13 at 3โ4; see also Settlement Agreement, \n18  Ryan-Lang Decl., Dkt. No. 12-1 at 17โ18, cited in Am. Compl. Dkt. No. 13 at 3โ4; id., \n19  Memorandum Submitting Use of Force Policy, Dkt. No. 12-2 at 57โ58, cited in Am. Compl., \n20  Dkt. No. 13 at 4.) The agreement included a plan for a court-appointed Monitor. (Dkt. No. 12-1 \n21  at 52โ70; Dkt. No. 12-2 at 5โ6.) According to the court-appointed Monitor when he submitted \n22  the Policy to the court, the Policy was โcalibrated to bring about Constitutional policing without \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 3 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 4 of 15\n \n \n \n1  sacrificing the safety and well-being of police officers or the general public.โ (Dkt. No. 12-2 at \n2  58.) \n3  Plaintiffs now allege the Policy is too solicitous of the rights of those being policed and \n4  insufficiently concerned with the rights of those employed as police officers. (See Am. Compl., \n5  Dkt. No. 13 at 2.) Plaintiffs bring their claims under ยง 1983 and Bivens, alleging the creation and \n6  implementation of the Policy violates their own Second and Fourth Amendment rights, their \n7  โright of self-defense as embedded in the Fourth Amendment,โ  the Equal Protection Clause, and \n8  substantive and procedural due process. (Id. at 22โ28.) They seek a declaration that the Policy \n9  infringes on their constitutional rights as well as injunctive relief and damages. (Id. at 28โ29.) \n10    In addition to the City, Mayor Ed Murray, and City Attorney Peter Holmes, Plaintiffs \n11  filed suit against federal actors involved in the settlement agreement and formulation of the \n12  Policy. One of those Defendants is Merrick Bobb, the court-appointed Monitor in the underlying \n13  litigation. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Bobb is liable for the constitutional errors they identify in the \n14  Policy because he allegedly seized control over the drafting process and refused input from the \n15  Seattle Police Department and its officers. (See Dkt. No. 13 at 5.) \n16    The City Defendants now move to dismiss the Amended Complaint, arguing Plaintiffsโ \n17  allegations fail to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 25.) \n18  Defendant Bobb also moves to dismiss on the grounds of quasi-judicial immunity. (Dkt. No. 19.) \n19  Analysis \n20  I.  Legal Standards \n21  A.  Motion to Dismiss \n22  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must state a claim for relief that is plausible \n23  on its face. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Courts follow a \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 5 of 15\n \n \n \n1  two-step approach when deciding whether a complaint survives a 12(b)(6) motion. Id. at 678โ79. \n2  First, โa court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaintโ unless the \n3  allegations are legal conclusions. Id. Second, the Court must decide whether the claim for relief \n4  is plausibleโa context-specific task. Id. \n5  B.  Evidence and Related Proceedings at the Motion to Dismiss Stage \n6  Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) provides that the Court โmay judicially notice a fact that \n7  is not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from \n8  sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.โ Thus, the Court may take notice of \n9  โdocuments [that] are not physically attached to the complaint . . . if the documentsโ โauthenticity \n10  . . . is not contestedโ and โthe plaintiffs complaint necessarily reliesโ on them.โ Lee v. City of Los \n11  Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted) (overruled on other grounds by \n12  Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125โ26 (9th Cir. 2002)). The Court may \n13  take judicial notice of โproceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial \n14  system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.โ Bias v. Moynihan, 508 \n15  F.3d 1212, 1225 (9th Cir. 2007). However, judicial notice may not extend to disputed facts stated \n16  within public records. Lee, 307 F.3d at 690. \n17  II.  The Monitor and Quasi-Judicial Function \n18  Defendant Bobb argues the claims against him must be dismissed because he has \n19  absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit in his role as Monitor. (Dkt. No. 19.) โAbsolute \n20  judicial immunity insulates judges from charges of erroneous acts or irregular action.โ Burton v. \n21  Infinity Capital Management, 753 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks and citations \n22  omitted). It โis not reserved solely for judges, but extends to nonjudicial officers for all claims \n23  relating to the exercise of judicial functions.โ Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted). โThe \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 5 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 6 of 15\n \n \n \n1  proponent of a claim to absolute immunity bears the burden of establishing the justification for \n2  such immunity.โ Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U.S. 429, 432 (1993). โTo qualify for \n3  absolute immunity, the function performed must be a judicial act with โa sufficiently close nexus \n4  to the adjudicative process.โ However, โit is only when the judgment of an official other than a \n5  judge involves the exercise of discretionary judgment that judicial immunity may be extended to \n6  that nonjudicial officer.โโ Burton, 753 F.3d at 960 (citations omitted). โTo be protected, the \n7  function performed must โinvolve the exercise of discretion in resolving disputes.โโ Id. Among \n8  the nonjudicial officers that have been extended quasi-judicial immunity are bankruptcy trustees, \n9  id., and court-appointed special masters. Atkinson-Baker & Assocs., Inc. v. Kolts, 7 F.3d 1452, \n10  1455 (9th Cir. 1993). \n11  Plaintiffs acknowledge Mr. Bobb was appointed by the Court in the underlying litigation \n12  to โoversee implementation of the Consent Agreement.โ (Dkt. No. 13 at 4.) According to the \n13  Order Approving Consensus Use of Force Policies, a document cited by Plaintiffs (Dkt. No. 13 \n14  at 3), โ[t]he role of the court, and the Monitor who serves as an agent of the court, [was] not to \n15  dictate policies to the SPD, but rather to insure that the Proposed Policies conform to the \n16  requirements of the Consent Decree, the United States Constitution, and judicial decisions \n17  interpreting the Cityโs constitutional obligations.โ (Dkt. No. 12-2 at Ex. 8, p. 65.) Plaintiffs \n18  allege that while Mr. Bobb agreed it was not his role to write the Policy (Dkt. No. 13 at 4, citing \n19  the Memorandum, Dkt. No. 12-2 at Ex. 7), the Policy was โaltered almost in its entirety and \n20  replaced with specific language provided, and required, by the Monitor.โ (Dkt. No. 13 at 5.) \n21  According to Plaintiffs, this โlanguageโ was the outcome preferred by the DOJ as opposed to the \n22  City. (See id. at 5, 27.) The Court must accept for the purpose of this motion that Mr. Bobb \n23  seized control over the drafting process, implemented the DOJโs preferred solutions, and refused \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 7 of 15\n \n \n \n1  input from other stakeholders such as officers of the Seattle Police Department. The question \n2  remains whether these alleged acts deprived him of quasi-judicial immunity for his role in the \n3  process. \n4  Plaintiffs argue that because the Consent Decree did not grant the Monitor the power to \n5  draft the Policy unilaterally, his actions were not โjudicial.โ (See Dkt. No. 36 at 6.) Plaintiffs \n6  concede โjudicialโ acts have been defined by the Supreme Court to encompass โthe function of \n7  resolving disputes between parties, or of authoritatively adjudicating private rights.โ (Id. at 5, \n8  citing Antoine, 508 U.S. at 435โ36.) It is clear that Mr. Bobb was appointed by the district court \n9  to oversee formulation of a Policy which was both the product and the subject of an ongoing \n10  โdispute between partiesโโnamely, the City of Seattle and the United States Department of \n11  Justice. According to Plaintiffs, Mr. Bobb agreed with the DOJโs preferred solutions and \n12  disagreed with the outcome preferred by Plaintiffs (who were not formal parties to the litigation). \n13  Still, this alleged course of action does not deprive his conduct of judicial character. Far from it: \n14  judges are usually persuaded by one side as opposed to another as they adjudicate disputes in our \n15  adversarial system. An outcome that favors one party is no less a โresolutionโ because it does not \n16  please all stakeholders. Here, the Court agrees with Defendant Bobb that even if Mr. Bobb \n17  engaged in the conduct Plaintiffs assign to him, he was engaged in an essential judicial function: \n18  that of resolving a dispute between the parties to the City of Seattle litigation at the request of a \n19  federal district court judge. \n20  Furthermore, that function involved discretion. See Burton, 753 F.3d at 960. Plaintiffs do \n21  not argue Mr. Bobb was constrained to take a single course of action with respect to the drafting \n22  of the policy, in the manner that a court reporter must produce a verbatim transcript of court \n23  proceedings. Cf. Antoine, 508 U.S. at 436โ37 (holding that court reporters are not entitled to \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 8 of 15\n \n \n \n1  quasi-judicial immunity because they are afforded no discretion in carrying out their duties). \n2  Rather, Plaintiffs argue that he formulated a policy that contained terms that favored one side in \n3  the dispute (Dkt. No. 36 at 4)โin other words, that he used his court-endowed discretion to \n4  reach a result Plaintiffs do not agree with. \n5  Because Defendant Bobb exercised discretion in resolving a dispute at the request of a \n6  district judge, he is entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit and the charges against \n7  him must be dismissed. \n8  III.  Cityโs Substantive Motion to Dismiss \n9  The City Defendants move to dismiss on the basis that Plaintiffsโ allegations fail to state \n10  a claim under the Second or Fourth Amendments, the Equal Protection Clause, or the Due \n11  Process Clause. (Dkt. No. 25.) \n12  A.  Second Amendment \n13  The City Defendants argue the Policy does not violate Plaintiffsโ Second Amendment \n14  rights because while the Second Amendment protects an individualโs right to bear arms, the \n15  Second Amendment does not provide that individuals have a right to use a firearm in any \n16  particular way. (Dkt. No. 25 at 7.) Plaintiffs contend that the Second Amendment codified a \n17  preexisting right to self-defense, and the Policy burdens that right. (Dkt. No. 59 at 4.) \n18  The Ninth Circuit has adopted a two-step test for analysis of Second Amendment claims: \n19  (1) the court asks whether the challenged law burdens conduct protected by the Second \n20  Amendment, and (2) if so, the court determines whether the law meets the appropriate level of \n21  scrutiny. See Jackson v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 746 F.3d 953, 960 (9th Cir. 2014); see \n22  also Peruta v. Cnty. of San Diego, 742 F.3d 1144, 1175 (9th Cir. 2014) (declining to apply a \n23  particular level of scrutiny in light of the type of Second Amendment burden imposed). \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 8 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 9 of 15\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs can point to no case establishing that the Second Amendment codified a free-\n2  standing right to self-defense, as opposed to case law interpreting the textual Second Amendment \n3  rights to โkeep and bear armsโ in light of their purposes (which the Supreme Court has held \n4  include the facilitation of self-defense). See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, \n5  628 (2008) (โAs the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-\n6  defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a \n7  prohibition of an entire class of โarmsโ that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for \n8  that lawful purpose.โ). In the criminal context, the Ninth Circuit rejected the idea that recent \n9  Supreme Court cases confirmed a Second Amendment right to use a weapon in any particular \n10  way: โ[N]either [Heller nor McDonald] concerned the use of a weapon, as distinct from mere \n11  possession. . . .โ United States v. Morsette, 622 F.3d 1200, 1202 (9th Cir. 2010). Similarly, \n12  nothing in the Supreme Courtโs recent Second Amendment jurisprudence lends support to \n13  Plaintiffsโ novel theory that a police department policy outlining expectations for an officerโs use \n14  of force can burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment. \n15  Instead, the Supreme Court has been clear that โthe right secured by the Second \n16  Amendment is not unlimitedโ and is โnot a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in \n17  any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.โ Heller, 554 U.S. at 626. Plaintiffs selectively \n18  quote historical sources cited in Heller to suggest that so long as self-defense is a purpose for the \n19  individual claiming a Second Amendment right, the Second Amendment forbids โunreasonableโ \n20  restrictions on the manner a weapon is used. (Dkt. No. 59 at 4.) In fact, contemporaneous sources \n21  relied on by the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit show that restrictions on the manner in \n22  which a weapon is used fall outside the scope of the Second Amendment. For example, the Ninth \n23  Circuit quoted and the Supreme Court cited the following nineteenth-century footnote: โ[I]t is \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 9 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 10 of 15\n \n \n \n1  generally held that statutes prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons are not in conflict with \n2  these constitutional provisions, since they merely forbid the carrying of arms in a particular \n3  manner, which is likely to lead to breaches of the peace and provoke to the commission of crime, \n4  rather than contribute to public or personal defence.โ The American Studentsโ Blackstone: \n5  Commentaries on the Laws of England 84 n.11 (George Chase ed., 3d ed. 1890) (emphasis \n6  supplied) (cited in Peruta v. County of San Diego, 742 F.3d 1144, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) and \n7  District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626 (2008)). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit relied on \n8  nineteenth-century legal commentator John Ordronaux for the proposition that โthe [Second] \n9  Amendment has never prevented โa State from enacting laws regulating the manner in which \n10  arms may be carried.โโ Peruta, 742 F.3d at 1165. According to the Ninth Circuit, these sources \n11  and case law demonstrate that โregulation of the right to bear arms is not only legitimate but \n12  quite appropriate.โ Id. at 1178 (emphasis in original). In addition to the categories of regulation \n13  specifically described in Heller, the Ninth Circuit stated, โNor should anything in this opinion be \n14  taken to cast doubt on the validity of measures designed to make the carrying of firearms for \n15  self-defense as safe as possible, both to the carrier and the community.โ Id. at 1178. \n16  Here, the Policy represents an effort by an employer, the Seattle Police Department, to \n17  regulate the use not only of (employer-issued) weapons but of the force its employees are \n18  specially sanctioned to wield on behalf of the city government. This scenario has no relation to \n19  the Second Amendment guarantees for individuals recognized in Heller, McDonald, and Peruta. \n20  Because the Policy does not burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment, the \n21  Court need not proceed to the second step of the analysis. Plaintiffs fail to state a plausible \n22  Second Amendment claim. \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 10 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 11 of 15\n \n \n \n1  B.  Fourth Amendment \n2  Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment argument rests on two grounds: the notion that the Policy \n3  itself effects a metaphorical โseizureโ (Dkt. No. 59 at 9โ11) and the notion that the case law \n4  analyzing the limits of citizensโ Fourth Amendment rights against the government can be flipped \n5  inside out to describe the positive rights of government actors (such as police officers) against \n6  citizens (id. at 11โ12). Both grounds grossly misconstrue Fourth Amendment law. \n7  Fourth Amendment seizures of persons are neither figurative nor hypothetical. The \n8  definition requires that a government actor โby means of physical force or show of authority, \n9  terminates or restrains [a personโs] freedom of movement [ . . . ] through means intentionally \n10  applied.โ Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 254 (2007). The Policy does not affect officersโ \n11  freedom of movement, so it does not โseizeโ Plaintiffs, even if, as Plaintiffs allege, the Policy \n12  places them at increased risk of injury. (See Dkt. No. 59 at 9.) \n13  Plaintiffs further argue that cases analyzing the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens have \n14  recognized a โcountervailing governmental interest[ ]โโthus purportedly endowing police \n15  officers with a Fourth Amendment right to use force. (See Dkt. No. 59 at 11, citing Graham v. \n16  Conner, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989)). This argument misses the mark entirely. A balancing test \n17  establishing the boundary where government action infringes on a citizenโs Fourth Amendment \n18  rights cannot be reinterpreted as a positive Fourth Amendment right for government actors to \n19  inflict force up to that boundary. \n20  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the Fourth Amendment. \n21  C.  Equal Protection Clause \n22  Plaintiffs base their Equal Protection Clause claim on the idea that the Policy burdens \n23  โfundamental rightsโ embedded in the Second and Fourth Amendments. (See Dkt. No. 59 at 12โ\n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 11 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 12 of 15\n \n \n \n1  13 (citing Tucson Womanโs Clinic v. Eden, 371 F.3d 1173, 1185 (9th Cir. 2004).) The Court has \n2  already analyzed Plaintiffsโ Second and Fourth Amendment arguments and found them wanting. \n3  No Supreme Court case identifies self-defense as a โfundamental rightโ on par with the right to \n4  marry or to vote. \n5  Plaintiffs also fail to make even the most rudimentary showing in an equal protection \n6  claim: they fail to describe themselves as members of an affected class similarly situated to those \n7  outside the class. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (โThe \n8  Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall โdeny to \n9  any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,โ which is essentially a \n10  direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.โ). Plaintiffs, like all officers \n11  with the Seattle Police Department, are subject to the Policy; they have identified no group that \n12  is similarly situated yet not subject to the Policy. \n13  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause. \n14  D.  Substantive Due Process \n15  Plaintiffs allege substantive due process claims โfor both their rights enumerated in the \n16  Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Equal Protection Clauseโ and โfor their \n17  independent constitutional right to self-defense.โ (Dkt. No. 59 at 13โ14.) As Plaintiffs \n18  acknowledge, substantive due process claims that relate to other constitutional provisions must \n19  be analyzed under the legal standards established for those provisions. See Graham v. Connor, \n20  490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989). As the Court has already explained, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim \n21  under the Second or Fourth Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause. \n22  As for the โindependent constitutional right to self-defense,โ Plaintiffs concede that โno \n23  case has expressly considered whether a police officerโs right to self-defense is protected by the \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 12 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 13 of 15\n \n \n \n1  Constitutionโ but ask the Court to locate it in the penumbrae of other constitutional provisions. \n2  (Dkt. No. 59 at 14โ17.) Courts are โreluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process \n3  because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-\n4  ended.โ Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992). Executive action such as \n5  the Policy violates substantive due process only when it is arbitrary, that is, when it โshocks the \n6  conscience.โ See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998). \n7  Plaintiffs characterize the Policy as excessively rigid and complicated. (Dkt. No. 59 at \n8  17.) They assert that delay and injury will result from the Policyโs checks on officersโ responses \n9  to violent suspects. (Id.) But substantive due process does not guarantee a reasonably safe \n10  workplace. Collins, 503 U.S. at 126. It does not shock the conscience to see certain de-escalation \n11  procedures imposed on police officers in an effort by their Department to avoid a pattern or \n12  practice of excessive use of force. (See generally Policy, Case No. C12-1282JLR, Dkt. No. 107 \n13  exhibits.) It would be at least surprising if allegations of such a pattern or practice did not lead to \n14  the adoption of stricter standards for use of force by officers. Furthermore, the Policy contains a \n15  number of concessions to the exigencies of the circumstances. (See, e.g., id. at Ex. 1, p. 3 (โAn \n16  Officer Shall Use Only the Degree of Force That Is Objectively Reasonable, Necessary Under \n17  the Circumstances, and Proportional to the Threat or Resistance of a Subject [. . . ] The \n18  reasonableness of a particular use of force is based on the totality of circumstances known by the \n19  officer at the time of the use of force and weighs the actions of the officer against the rights of \n20  the subject, in light of the circumstances surrounding the event. It must be judged from the \n21  perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight[.] \n22  The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often \n23  forced to make split-second decisionsโin circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 13 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 14 of 15\n \n \n \n1  evolvingโabout the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.โ).) It must also be \n2  acknowledged that the Policy provides officers with a wide range of tools to gain control over \n3  situations and to protect themselves, from use of verbal commands to physical restraint, \n4  TASERS, pepper spray, and batons, in addition to firearms. (See id. at Ex. 1, pp. 8โ10.) The \n5  Policy is not so inflexible and arbitrary as to shock the conscience, even if it slows or even \n6  forestalls the application of force in police interactions with resisting subjects.  \n7  E.  Procedural Due Process \n8  Plaintiffs complain that they were not included in the process by which the Policies were \n9  adopted, but they cite to no case imposing such a requirement on government employers. (See \n10  Dkt. No. 59 at 20.) Furthermore, Plaintiffs locate the liberty interests of which Plaintiffs were \n11  allegedly deprived in the Second and Fourth Amendments, and the Court has already held that \n12  Plaintiffsโ rights in these areas were not violated. (See id.) Plaintiffs were not due any particular \n13  process in the adoption of use-of-force standards by their employer; to the extent they were \n14  invited to participate, that participation was a privilege rather than a right. \n15  F.  Cityโs Other Arguments \n16  The City also argues that Plaintiffs lack standing, fail to state a claim against the Seattle \n17  mayor and city attorney, and do not merit injunctive relief. (Dkt. No. 25 at 20โ23.) Because the \n18  Court concludes Plaintiffs fail to state plausible claims for relief with respect to any defendant, \n19  the Court does not reach these questions. \n20  Conclusion \n21    Because Defendant Bobb is an agent of the court entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, the \n22  Court GRANTS his Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 19.) In addition, because Plaintiffsโ Complaint \n23  fails to state a claim for relief under ยง 1983 or Bivens for violation of their Second or Fourth \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS- 14 \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 73   Filed 10/17/14   Page 15 of 15\n \n \n \n1  Amendment rights, the Equal Protection Clause, or substantive or procedural due process, the \n2  Court GRANTS the City Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 25.) The case is therefore \n3  DISMISSED for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because \n4  the Complaint has already been amended once and further amendment would be futile, the \n5  dismissal is with prejudice. \n6   \n7  The clerk is ordered to provide copies of this order to all counsel. \n8   \n9  Dated this 17th day of October, 2014. \n10   \nA\n11 \n             \n \n12 \nMarsha J.

At step one, the panel assumed without deciding\nthat  the  use  of  force  policy  was  subject  to  Second\nAmendment protection.  At step two, the panel held that the\nuse of force policy recognized that the plaintiffs could use\ntheir  department-issued  firearms  in  self-defense  in  an\nencounter with a suspect, and concluded that the use of force\npolicy did not impose a substantial burden on plaintiffsโ right\nto use a firearm for the purpose of lawful self-defense.  The\npanel also concluded that the use of force policy was not such\na severe restriction that it amounted to a destruction of the\nSecond Amendment right.  The panel, therefore, applied the\nintermediate level of constitutional scrutiny to determine\nwhether the policy violated the Second Amendment.\nApplying intermediate scrutiny, the panel concluded that\nthe use of force policy was constitutional under the Second\n** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

CITY OF SEATTLE 7\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nIn 2012, the United States brought a civil action in the\nUnited States  District Court  for the Western District  of\nWashington against the City of Seattle, alleging that the\nSeattle Police Department (โSPDโ) engaged in a pattern or\npractice of excessive use of force.  United States v. City of\nSeattle,  Case  No.  2:12-cv-01282-JLR  (W.D.  Wash.). \nPursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties, the\nUnited States and the City of Seattle worked with a court-\nappointed monitor to produce a Use of Force Policy (โUF\nPolicyโ) that would apply to SPD officersโ use of approved\ndepartment firearms while on duty.\nOn December 17, 2013, United States District Judge\nJames L. Robart issued an order approving the policy agreed\nto  by  the  parties.1    The  UF  Policy2  states,  in  part,  that\nโ[o]fficers  shall  only  use  objectively  reasonable  force,\nproportional to the threat or urgency of the situation, when\nnecessary, to achieve a law-enforcement objective.โ  The UF\nPolicy provides a set of factors that officers must consider to\ndetermine whether a proposed use of force is objectively\nreasonable, necessary, and proportional to the threat at issue.\n1 The order is styled as an โOrder Approving Consensus Use of Force\nPoliciesโ submitted by the court-appointed monitor.\n2 We take judicial notice of and reference the revised UF Policy in\nAppelleesโ request for judicial notice (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 28โ85), as well as\nthe docket sheet from United States v. City of Seattle, Case No. 12-cv-\n01282-JLR (W.D. Wash.).  See Reynโs Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc.,\n442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) (โWe may take judicial notice of\ncourt filings and other matters of public record.โ).  We deny the City of\nSeattleโs second request for judicial notice of a subsequent revised UF\nPolicy on the grounds that the document remains pending court approval.\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e8  8o fo 2f 121\n8 MAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE\nAlthough the UF Policy requires officers to consider those\nfactors before using a firearm, the UF Policy also states that\nofficers must consider those factors only โ[w]hen safe under\nthe totality of circumstances and time and circumstances\npermit[.]โ The UF Policy also requires officers to use de-\nescalation tactics to reduce the need for force only โ[w]hen\nsafe and feasible under the totality of circumstances[.]โ\nAppellants, a group of approximately 125 SPD officers,\nsubsequently brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nagainst the City of Seattle, including SPD and other related\nentities, to challenge the constitutionality of the UF Policy. \nAppellants brought claims under the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\nand Fourteenth Amendments, alleging that the UF Policy\nunreasonably restricts their right to use department-issued\nfirearms for self-defense.  On October 17, 2014, the district\ncourt granted the motion to dismiss filed by the City of\nSeattle, concluding that the UF Policy did not burden conduct\nprotected by the Second Amendment.  Mahoney v. Holder,\n62 F. Supp. 3d 1215, 1222 (W.D. Wash. 2014).  Appellants\ntimely appealed.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.  We review\nde novo the district courtโs dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  See\nN.M. State Inv. Council v. Ernst & Young LLP, 641 F.3d\n1089,  1094  (9th  Cir.  2011).    We  review  de  novo  all\nconstitutional rulings.  See Wilson v. Lynch, 835 F.3d 1083,\n1090 (9th Cir. 2016).  We may affirm on any basis supported\nby the record below.  See Bill v. Brewer, 799 F.3d 1295, 1299\n(9th Cir. 2015).\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e9  9o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE 9\nWhen evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\nwe accept the well-pleaded factual allegations of a complaint\nas true and construe all inferences in favor of the nonmoving\nparty.  Ariz. Studentsโ Assโn v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 824 F.3d\n858, 864 (9th Cir. 2016).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is\nwarranted if a complaint fails โto state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n544, 570 (2007).  โConclusory allegations of law . . . are\ninsufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.โ  Lee v. City of Los\nAngeles, 250 F.3d 668, 679 (9th Cir. 2001).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Second Amendment Precedent and Two-Step Inquiry\nThe Second Amendment provides: โA well regulated\nMilitia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed.โ  U.S. Const. amend. II.  In District of Columbia v.\nHeller,  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  District  of\nColumbia statutes that required residents to keep firearms in\nthe home unloaded and disassembled and prohibited the\npossession of handguns in the home violated the Second\nAmendment.  554 U.S. 570, 574โ75, 635 (2008).  The Court\nrecognized that โthe inherent right of self-defense has been\ncentral to the Second Amendment right.โ  Id. at 628.  The\nCourt  concluded  that  the  statutes  at  issue  โma[de]  it\nimpossible for citizens to use [firearms] for the core lawful\npurpose of self-defense and [were] hence unconstitutional.โ \nId. at 630.  The Court subsequently applied the right to keep\nand bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment\nagainst the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in\nMcDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010).\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 01 0o fo 2f 121\n10 MAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE\nFollowing Heller and McDonald, we โadopt[ed a] two-\nstep . . . inquiryโ to determine whether a challenged law or\nregulation violates the Second Amendment.  United States v.\nChovan, 735 F.3d 1127, 1136 (9th Cir. 2013).  The two-step\ninquiry โreflects the Supreme Courtโs holding in Heller that,\nwhile the Second Amendment protects an individual right to\nkeep and bear arms, the scope of that right is not unlimited.โ \nId.  A majority of our sister circuits have adopted this two-\nstep inquiry to analyze Second Amendment claims.  See\nSilvester v. Harris, 843 F.3d 816, 820โ21 (9th Cir. 2016).\nAt the first step, courts ask whether โthe challenged law\nburdens conduct protected by the Second Amendment[.]โ \nChovan, 735 F.3d at 1136.  If a court answers this question in\nthe  affirmative,  โthe  regulation  is  subject  to  Second\nAmendment protection (i.e., the regulation is neither outside\nthe  historical  scope  of  the  Second  Amendment,  nor\npresumptively lawful), [and] the court then proceeds to the\nsecond step of the inquiry to determine the appropriate level\nof scrutiny to apply.โ  Silvester, 843 F.3d at 821 (citing\nJackson v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 746 F.3d 953, 960\n(9th Cir. 2014)).\nII. Step One: Whether the UF Policy Burdens Conduct\nProtected by the Second Amendment\nTo determine whether the UF Policy burdens conduct\nprotected by the Second Amendment, we ask whether the UF\nPolicy  โis  one  of  the  โpresumptively  lawful  regulatory\nmeasuresโ identified in Heller, or whether the record includes\npersuasive historical evidence establishing that the regulation\nat issue imposes prohibitions that fall outside the historical\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 11 1o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE 11\nscope of the Second Amendment[.]โ3  Jackson, 746 F.3d at\n960 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 627 n.26).\nโHeller indicated that the Second Amendment does not\npreclude  certain  โlongstanding  prohibitionsโ  and\nโpresumptively  lawful  regulatory  measures,โ  such  as\nโprohibitions on carrying concealed weapons,โ โprohibitions\non the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,โ\nโlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places\nsuch as schools and government buildings,โ โlaws imposing\nconditions  and  qualifications  on  the  commercial  sale  of\narms,โ and prohibitions on โthe carrying of โdangerous and\nunusual weapons,โโ referring to weapons that were not โin\ncommon use at the timeโ of the enactment of the Second\nAmendment.โ  Id. at 959 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 626โ27,\n627 n.26).  In this case, the UF Policyโan employer policy\nthat regulates a police officerโs use of a department-issued\nfirearm  while  on  dutyโdoes  not  resemble  any  of  the\nโpresumptively lawfulโ regulations  recognized in  Heller. \n554 U.S. at 627 n.26.\nNext, we examine the record to determine โwhether there\nis persuasive historical evidence showing that the regulation\ndoes not impinge on the Second Amendment right as it was\nhistorically understood.โ  Silvester, 843 F.3d at 821.  In this\ncase, the parties have not provided any โpersuasive historical\nevidenceโ demonstrating that regulating police officersโ use\n3 Appellants assert that the UF Policy infringes on their Second\nAmendment right to self-defense and then frame the historical inquiry\naround this right.  The scope of Appellantsโ inquiry is too broad.  Instead,\nwe must examine whether restrictions on a government employeeโs use of\na government-issued firearm in the line of duty fall outside the historical\nscope of the Second Amendment.\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 21 2o fo 2f 121\n12 MAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE\nof department-issued firearms is historically longstanding or\nfalls outside the historical scope of the Second Amendment. \nJackson, 746 F.3d at 960, 963.  We do not purport to rule\ndefinitively  on  whether,  historically,  officers  have  been\nrestricted in the use of their government-issued firearms\nwhile acting within the scope of their employment.  However,\nโ[b]ecause of the lack of historical evidence in the record\nbefore us,โ see Chovan, 735 F.3d at 1137 (internal quotation\nmark and citation omitted), โwe assume, without deciding,\nthat the [UF Policy] burdens conduct falling within the scope\nof the Second Amendment.โ  Bauer v. Becerra, 858 F.3d\n1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 2017).\nBecause  the  UF  Policy  resembles  none  of  the\npresumptively lawful measures identified in Heller, and the\nparties have adduced no evidence that the UF Policy imposes\na restriction on conduct that falls outside the historical scope\nof the Second Amendment right to use a firearm for self-\ndefense, we assume the UF Policy โis subject to Second\nAmendment protectionโ and we proceed to the second step of\nthe inquiry.4  Silvester, 843 F.3d at 821.\nIII. Step Two: Applying Constitutional Scrutiny to the\nUF Policy\nA. Determining the Level of Scrutiny\nTo ascertain the proper level of constitutional scrutiny to\napply to the UF Policy at the second step, we must consider:\n4 The district court concluded that the UF Policy did not burden\nconduct protected by the Second Amendment, and therefore did not\nproceed to the second step of the inquiry.  See Mahoney, 62 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1221โ22.\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 31 3o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V.

A restriction โthat implicates\nthe  core  of  the  Second  Amendment  right  and  severely\nburdens  that  right  warrants  strict  scrutiny[,]โ  while  a\nrestriction  that  โโdoes  not  implicate  a  core  Second\nAmendment right, or does not place a substantial burden on\nthe  Second  Amendment  rightโโ  warrants  intermediate\nscrutiny.  Id. (quoting Jackson, 746 F.3d at 961).\nIn addressing the extent to which the UF Policy burdens\nAppellantsโ  constitutional  right  under  the  Second\nAmendment, we begin with Hellerโs holding that the Second\nAmendment protects the right of citizens to use a firearm โfor\nthe core lawful purpose of self-defense[.]โ  Heller, 554 U.S.\nat  630.    When  evaluating  the  constitutional  claim  of  a\ngovernment employee, however, the Supreme Court instructs\nus to balance the rights of the employee โagainst the realities\nof the employment context.โ  Engquist v. Or. Depโt of Agr.,\n553 U.S. 591, 600 (2008).\nIn Engquist, the Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of\nan equal protection challenge to the decision of the Oregon\nDepartment of Agriculture to terminate an employee โin a\nseemingly arbitrary or irrational manner.โ  Id. at 605.  The\nCourt stated, โWe have long held the view that there is a\ncrucial difference, with respect to constitutional analysis,\nbetween the government exercising โthe power to regulate or\nlicense,  as  lawmaker,โ  and  the  government  acting  โas\nproprietor, to manage [its] internal operation.โโ  Id. at 598\n(quoting  Cafeteria  &  Rest.

Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 675\n(1994)  (plurality  opinion));  see  also  Nordyke  v.  King,\n681  F.3d  1041,  1044โ45  (9th  Cir.  2012)  (en  banc)\n(concluding that an ordinance regulating โthe sale of firearms\n. . . only minimally, and only on County propertyโ was\nconstitutional under the Second Amendment, while citing\nwith approval the Engquist lawmaker/proprietor distinction);\nBonidy v. U.S. Postal Serv., 790 F.3d 1121, 1126โ27 (10th\nCir.  2015)  (concluding  that  a  regulation  prohibiting  the\npossession  of  firearms  on  Postal  Service  property  was\nconstitutional under the Second Amendment, recognizing that\nโ[t]he government often has more flexibility to regulate when\nit is acting as a proprietor (such as when it manages a post\noffice) than when it is acting as a sovereign (such as when it\nregulates  private  activity  unconnected  to  a  government\nservice)โ).\nIn this case, the UF Policy regulates Appellantsโ use of\ndepartment-issued firearms while acting in the course and\nscope of their official duties as police officers.  The firearms\nregulated by the UF Policy are issued to Appellants by the\nCity of Seattle in its capacity as proprietor.  The UF Policy\nwas adopted by the City of Seattle as an employer to regulate\nthe conduct of its police officers.  Because the City of Seattle\nhas a significant interest in regulating the use of department-\nissued  firearms  by  its  employees,  we  conclude  that  the\napplication  of  intermediate  scrutiny  to  the  UF  Policy\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 51 5o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE 15\nappropriately places the burden on the City of Seattle to\njustify placing restrictions on any Second Amendment right\nof its employees, while also giving the City the flexibility to\nact as an employer.\nThe  second  factor  in  determining  what  level  of\nconstitutional scrutiny to apply to the UF Policy requires us\nto consider the severity of the UF Policyโs burden on the right\nof citizens to use a firearm for the core lawful purpose of self-\ndefense.  See Chovan, 735 F.3d at 1138.  โThis court has\nexplained that laws which regulate only the โmanner in which\npersons may exercise their Second Amendment rightsโ are\nless burdensome than those which bar firearm possession\ncompletely.โ  Silvester, 843 F.3d at 827 (quoting Chovan,\n735 F.3d at 1138).  However, to determine the severity of the\nburden on the Second Amendment right, we look closely at\nthe restriction on the manner of firearm possession to ensure\nit is not โsuch a severe restriction on the core right of self-\ndefense that it โamounts to a destruction of the [Second\nAmendment] right[.]โโ  Jackson, 746 F.3d at 961 (quoting\nHeller, 554 U.S. at 629); see also Peruta v. Cty. of San Diego,\n824 F.3d 919, 950 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (Callahan, J.,\ndissenting)  (courts  should  consider  Second  Amendment\nchallenges to firearm restrictions in โcontextโ to ensure the\nrestrictions are not โtantamount to complete bans on the\nSecond Amendment right to bear arms outside the home for\nself-defenseโ), cert. denied, โ U.S. โ, 137 S. Ct. 1995 (June\n26, 2017).\nIn this case, the UF Policy applies to Appellantsโ use of\ndepartment-issued firearms in the course and scope of their\nofficial duties.  The UF Policy states that a police officer\nโmay draw or exhibit a firearm in the line of duty when the\nofficer has reasonable cause to believe it may be necessary\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 61 6o fo 2f 121\n16 MAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE\nfor his or her own safety or for the safety of others[.]โ  The\nUF Policy states that prior to using physical force during an\nincident with a subject, Appellants โshall consider whether a\nsubjectโs lack of compliance is a deliberate attempt to resist\nor an inability to comply based onโ a variety of factors,\nincluding the subjectโs possible medical conditions, mental\nimpairment, developmental disability, drug interaction, and\nbehavioral crisis.  The UF Policy requires that โwhen safe\nunder  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  and  time  and\ncircumstances permit, officers shall use de-escalation tactics\nin order to reduce the need for force[.]โ\nThe UF Policy explicitly recognizes that Appellants may\nuse their department-issued firearms in self-defense in an\nencounter with a suspectโincluding the use of deadly force\nwith a firearm.  The UF Policy states that โ[d]eadly force may\nonly be used in circumstances where threat of death or serious\nphysical injury to the officer or others is imminent[,]โ and\nrecognizes  that  โsometimes  the  use-of-force  is\nunavoidable[.]โ  As a result, the UF Policy does not impose\na substantial burden on Appellantsโ right to use a firearm for\nthe purpose of lawful self-defense.  See Jackson, 746 F.3d at\n968 (concluding that a statute prohibiting the sale of hollow-\npoint bullets did not โplace a substantial burden on the\nSecond Amendment rightโ because the statute โlimits only\nthe  manner  in  which  a  person  may  exercise  Second\nAmendment rights by making it more difficult to purchase\ncertain types of ammunition.โ).  Thus, the nature of the\nburden imposed by the UF Policy on Appellantsโ Second\nAmendment right to use a firearm for the lawful purpose of\nself-defense favors the application of intermediate scrutiny.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the UF Policy does not\nimpose a substantial burden on the Second Amendment right\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 71 7o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V.

Therefore,\nwe apply intermediate scrutiny to determine whether the UF\nPolicy  violates  the  Second  Amendment.    See  Silvester,\n843 F.3d at 823 (โThere is accordingly near unanimity in the\npost-Heller case law that when considering regulations that\nfall within the scope of the Second Amendment, intermediate\nscrutiny is appropriate.โ).\nB. Application of Intermediate Scrutiny\nโIn  the  context  of  Second  Amendment  challenges,\nintermediate scrutiny requires: โ(1) the governmentโs stated\nobjective to be significant, substantial, or important; and (2) a\nreasonable fit between the challenged regulation and the\nasserted objective.โโ  Fyock v.

Jackson,\n746  F.3d  at  965.    In  Jackson,  we  explained  that  โ[i]n\nconsidering a cityโs justifications for its ordinance, we do not\nimpose โan unnecessarily rigid burden of proof . . . so long as\nwhatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed\nto be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.โโ  Id.\n(quoting City of Renton v.

See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 748\n(1987)  (โ[T]he  Governmentโs  regulatory  interest  in\ncommunity  safety  can,  in  appropriate  circumstances,\noutweigh an individualโs liberty interest.โ); Jackson, 746 F.3d\nat 965 (quoting Chovan, 735 F.3d at 1139) (โโIt is self-\nevident,โ . . . that public safety is an important government\ninterest.โ).  The record establishes that the City of Seattle\nenacted the UF Policy to address the important government\nobjective of ensuring public safety and police officer safety. \nSee Chovan, 735 F.3d at 1140 (โWe hold that the government\nhas met its burden to show that reducing domestic gun\nviolence is an important government objective.โ).\nAt  the  second  step,  we  consider  whether  there  is  a\nreasonable fit between the UF Policy and the City of Seattleโs\nasserted objective of ensuring the safety of the public and its\npolice officers.  In determining the degree of fit between the\nchallenged regulation and its asserted objective, the City of\nSeattle is โnot required to show that [the UF Policy] is the\nleast restrictive means of achieving its interest.โ  Fyock,\n779 F.3d at 1000 (citing Jackson, 746 F.3d at 966).  To\nsurvive intermediate scrutiny, we must determine whether the\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e1 91 9o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE 19\nrecord shows that the UF Policy โpromotes a โsubstantial\ngovernment interest that would be achieved less effectively\nabsent the regulation.โโ  Id. (quoting Colacurcio v. City of\nKent, 163 F.3d 545, 553 (9th Cir. 1998)).\nIn this case, the UF Policy states that โ[o]fficers shall only\nuse objectively reasonable force, proportional to the threat or\nurgency of the situation, when necessary, to achieve a law-\nenforcement objective.โ  The UF Policy also requires that\nAppellants use โ[d]e-escalation tactics and techniques . . .\nwhen  safe  and  without  compromising  law  enforcement\npriorities,โ and states that Appellants โshall consider whether\na subjectโs lack of compliance is a deliberate attempt to resist\nor an inability to comply based onโ a variety of factors. \nThose provisions advance the City of Seattleโs important\ngovernment interest of ensuring the safety of the public by\nmandating  de-escalation  techniques  and  reducing  the\nlikelihood that a firearm will be drawn or used where such\nforce is not โobjectively reasonable,โ โproportional to the\nthreat or urgency of the situation,โ or โnecessary to achieve\na law-enforcement objective.โ\nThe  UF  Policy  also  advances  the  City  of  Seattleโs\nimportant government interest of ensuring the safety of its\npolice officers. The UF Policy requires Appellants to employ\nde-escalation techniques only โ[w]hen safe under the totality\nof the circumstances and time and circumstances permit.โ\nThus, the UF Policy expressly contemplates that de-escalation\ntechniques will not be feasible in every situation, and even\nstates that โsometimes, the use of force is unavoidable.โ The\nUF Policy also provides that Appellants may use deadly force\nwhere an objectively reasonable officer would conclude that\nthe โthreat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or\nothers is imminent.โ These provisions ensure that Appellants\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e2 02 0o fo 2f 121\n20 MAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE\nmay  use  their  department-issued  firearms  to  defend\nthemselves and the public.\nIn adopting the UF Policy, the City of Seattle drew\nโreasonable inference[s]โ that the UF Policy would assist in\nensuring the safety of both the public and its police officers. \nJackson, 746 F.3d at 966.  The UF Policy advances an\nimportant government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively in its absence.  See Silvester, 843 F.3d at 829\n(concluding that a statute imposing a ten-day waiting period\nto purchase firearms on certain individuals was reasonably fit\nto stateโs public safety objective).  Given the City of Seattleโs\nimportant interest in promoting the safety of the public and its\npolice officers, we determine there is a reasonable fit between\nthe UF Policy and this significant goal.  We conclude that the\nUF Policy survives intermediate scrutiny and is, therefore,\nconstitutional under the Second Amendment.  Because we\nfind the UF Policy is constitutional, we affirm the district\ncourtโs dismissal of the Second Amendment claim.\nIV. The Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection\nClaims\nWe  also  affirm  the  district  courtโs  dismissal  of  the\nremaining claims.  First, we agree with the district court that\ncurrent  case  law  does  not  support  the  existence  of  a\nfreestanding fundamental right to self-defense outside of the\nโthe right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in\ndefense of hearth and home.โ  Heller, 554 U.S. at 635. \nBecause  precedent  does  not  support  recognizing  the\nfundamental right Appellantsโ assert, Appellantsโ substantive\ndue process claim is not a cognizable claim upon which relief\ncan be granted.\n\n  CCaassee:  21:41-43-5cv9-7000,7 0994/-1M9/J2P0 1  7D,o IcDu: m10e5n8t 57593  2 F, iDlekdt E0n9t/r1y9: /5107-  1 P, Pagaeg e2 12 1o fo 2f 121\nMAHONEY V. CITY OF SEATTLE 21\nSecond,  the  district  court  properly  concluded  that\nAppellants failed to state a cognizable equal protection claim. \nAppellants failed to allege facts to support the claim that they\nare  being  denied  a  fundamental  right  while  others  are\npermitted to exercise such right, and that there is no valid\njustification for the distinction.  Further, this claim is not\ncognizable under the Equal Protection Clause because it is\nโno more than a [Second] Amendment claim dressed in equal\nprotection clothing[.]โ  Orin v. Barclay, 272 F.3d 1207, 1213\nn.3 (9th Cir. 2001).\nCONCLUSION\nThe City of Seattle has a significant interest in regulating\nthe use of department-issued firearms by its police officers,\nand the UF Policy does not impose a substantial burden on\nthe Second Amendment right to use a firearm for the core\nlawful  purpose  of  self-defense.    Therefore,  we  apply\nintermediate scrutiny to determine whether the UF Policy\nviolates the Second Amendment right of its police officers. \nWe conclude that the UF Policy is constitutional under the\nSecond Amendment because there is a reasonable fit between\nthe UF Policy and the City of Seattleโs important government\ninterest in ensuring the safety of both the public and its police\nofficers.    We  affirm  the  district  courtโs  dismissal  of\nAppellantsโ Second Amendment claim.\nWe affirm the ruling of the district court on all other\ngrounds.\nAFFIRMED.",

'  ) \n) \n23 \n24  I. SUMMARY OF CLAIMS \n25 \nDefendants have promulgated and imposed new use of force (UF) policies and \n26 \npractices in reckless and deliberate indifference to the protections afforded Plaintiffs by the \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  I \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 2 of 80\nConstitution: (1) The UF policies and practices unreasonably restrict and burden Plaintiffs' \n1  right to use force reasonably required, to protect themselves and others, from apparent harm \n2 \nand danger, in violation of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the \n3 \nConstitution.  (2) The new UF policies and practices require -without appropriate \n4 \nconsideration of an officer's knowledge, training, experience, or the apparent danger of the \n5 \n6  circumstances confronting him or her -that Plaintiffs use significantly less force than is being \n7  threatened against them by suspects.  This includes, for example, prohibiting Plaintiffs from \n8 \nusing reasonable and effective force tools or techniques against vaguely defined, newly \n9 \nprotected classes of suspects unless deadly force is the only other option.  This significantly \n10 \nincreases the likelihood that such persons will get killed or seriously injured in encounters \n11 \n12  with the police -a terrible result and a violation of those suspects' rights -as well as a clear \n13 \nviolation of constitutional protections afforded Plaintiffs to reasonably protect themselves \n14 \nand others from threats of harm. (3) In the balancing of interests required by the Fourth \n15 \nAmendment, Plaintiffs' right not to be required to take unnecessary risks with their personal \n16 \nsafety in the performance of their duties are consistently violated, by the UF policies and \n17 \n18  practices, in favor of suspects' alleged rights in situations where suspects appear to be or are \n''-._  engaged in threatening and dangerous conduct. (4) The UF policies and practices work to \n20 \nundermine and destroy the longstanding totality-of-the-circumstances standard for making, \n21 \nanalyzing, and reviewing officers' reasonable UF decisions by undermining, at each step, the \n22 \nintegrity of officers' judgments as a whole.  (5) The Court requires UF standards to be \n23 \n24  simple, practical and useful to the officer doing his or her job. The new UF Policy clearly is \n25 \nnot.  In some places it is overly complicated and contradictory, in other places overly precise \n26 \nand mechanical, but throughout, requires Plaintiff to engage in mental gymnastics wholly \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 3 of 80\nunreasonable in light of the dangerous and fast evolving cifcumstances we face every day. \n1  This creates unnecessary and, therefore, unconstitutional risks to Plaintiffs' safety.  (6) The \n2 \nUF policies and practices require Plaintiffs to under-react to threats of hann until we have no \n3 \nchoice but to overreact. This makes it inevitable - although unnecessary and unreasonable -\n4 \nthat officers and citizens will get killed or seriously injured.  Moreover, the policies and \n5 \n6  practices are designed to trap Plaintiffs into violations even where Plaintiffs did, or could \n7 \nhave, acted in a completely reasonable and justifiable manner under the law.  This places \n8 \nunconstitutional risks and burdens on Plaintiffs' lives and livelihood and necessarily subjects \n9 \nthem to the very second-guessing prohibited by the Constitution. (7) The UF policies and \n10 \n11  procedures attempt to fundamentally alter longstanding principles and standards governing \n12  acceptable and lawful police conduct, thus significantly altering the terms and conditions of \n13 \nPlaintiffs' employment, including potentially interfering with Plaintiffs' rights to qualified \n14 \nimmunity for their reasonable uses of force, without Plaintiffs having had any meaningful \n15 \nopportunity to participate and be heard in the process. \n16 \n17 \n18  II. JURISDICTION and PARTIES \n19 \n1.  Plaintiffs, sworn officers of the Seattle Police Department (SPD), bring this action under \n20 \n42 USC ยง 1983 against the City of Seattle, including the SPD, and certain City of Seattle \n21 \n(City) employees, including Mayors, Chiefs of Police, and the Seattle Police Monitor \n22 \n23  (Monitor) and his staff(Monitoring Team), alleging that Defendants have deprived \n24 \nPlaintiffs of the rights and protection secured for them by the Second, Fourth, Fifth and \n25 \nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution under color of policies and practices of the \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 4 of 80\nCity related to Plaintiffs' use of force in their interactions with threatening or resisting \n1  suspects. \n2 \n2.  Plaintiffs also have a cause of action, under 28 USC ยง 1331, against the United States \n3 \nAttorney General (AG) and certain officials of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). \n4 \nDOJ officials are a party to the consent decree under which the UF policy has been \n5 \n6  implemented in order to remedy an alleged pattern and practice of excessive UF. \n7 \nMoreover, it is clear from this case as well as other DOJ investigations around the \n8 \nCountry that DOJ's explicit goal is to re-write longstanding policing standards around use \n9 \nof force in a manner that conflicts with the Constitution.  Though the Monitor is paid by \n10 \nthe City, it has been made clear to the City that the Monitor will not fmd the City in \n11 \n12  compliance until the City and SPD establish and implement new UF policies and \n13 \npractices that include the unconstitutional standards dictated by DOJ. \n14 \n3.  A complete list of Plaintiffs, including badge numbers and contact information is \n15 \nattached to this Complaint. A complete list of Defendants, with contact information, is \n16 \nalso attached. \n17 \n18 \nIll. INTRODUCTION \n19 \n20  4.  It is unfortunate that we have to file this complaint.  Plaintiffs emphatically agree with \n21 \nDefendants that 'constitutional policing is effective policing'.  Moreover, notwithstanding \n22 \nthe reams of paper, and huge bills for the City being generated by DOJ and the Monitor, \n23 \nthere is one, simple goal and point of agreement that addresses the entirety of DOJ's \n24 \ninvestigation of SPD:  \"The goal of the Parties in entering the Settlement Agreement is to \n25 \n26  ensure that SPD's use of force is consistent with the requirements of the United States \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 5 of 80\nConstitution.\"  SPD and the City agreed to this - and only this - even as they adamantly \n1  disagreed with DOJ's fmdings of excessive force.  Accordingly, SPD and the City agreed \n2 \nto develop a UF Policy consistent with the constitutional standards and principles set \n3 \nforth in Graham v. Connor. \n4 \n5.  What SPD and the City have drafted instead, however, with heavy-handed oversight by \n5 \n6  DOJ and the Monitor, is a policy that wholly disregards the Court's clear prioritization of \n7 \nthe practical safety issues facing police officers over burdensome policy requirements, in \n8 \nlight of the Court's understanding of the dynamics of threatening and violent encounters \n9 \nwith suspects.  The new policy substantially undermines the constitutional protections \n10 \nand rights afforded Plaintiffs - asking us to take unreasonable risks with our safety and \n11 \n12  our lives.  As a consequence, it leaves the public significantly less safe as well. \n13 \n6.  Research shows, overwhelmingly, that police officers under-react and hesitate in the face \n14 \nof threats of violence, and are often killed or seriously injured as a result.  Moreover, the \n15 \nCourt expressly is cognizant of this country's long history of armed violence, particularly \n16 \nby suspects against police officers. Thus, overwhelmingly, standard police doctrine, \n17 \n18  policy and best practices, based on decades of related case law, require officers first and \n19 \nforemost to assess the threat presented by the suspect, and to react reasonably in response \n20 \nto the threat, without delay or hesitation.  By contrast, the new UF Policy requires patrol \n21 \nofficers to focus, not on the nature of the threat, but instead to recall pages and pages of \n22 \nconfusing and often contradictory factors, qualifiers, analyses, and special considerations \n23 \n24  for certain classes of suspects, which greatly impairs the decision-making process for \n25 \nofficers.  This is especially problematic considering that these decisions are often made \n26 \nunder extremely difficult, emotionally-charged and dangerous circumstances where time-\nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  5 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 6 of 80\nconsuming and nuanced analysis is virtually impossible. The UF policy further induces \n1  hesitation because officers are fearful of censure and sanction should their actions, in \n2 \nhindsight, be judged to have violated any of a number of layers of rules and provisions \n3 \nthat invite conflicting interpretation.  What is more, the policy requires that many UF \n4 \ndecisions be made, and judged, after-the-fact, based on the 'actual threat', rather than the \n5 \n6  'reasonably perceived threat', which has long been the constitutional standard for both \n7 \npolice officers and citizens.  The real-world effect of this UF Policy is to induce a \n8 \nreluctance by patrol officers to use appropriate and sufficient levels of force to control \n9 \ndangerous suspects.  It effectively creates hesitation and paralysis by analysis that puts \n10 \nofficers, suspects and the general public at greater risk of injury or death, as a situation \n11 \n12  that might have been quelled early on is allowed to spiral to increasingly higher levels of \n13 \nviolence because the officer uses too little force too late. The new policy is the type of \n14 \npolicy the Court has consistently rejected.  The Court has time and again overturned \n15 \nallegedly \"helpful,\" but overly prescriptive and mechanical rules and policies under the \n16 \nFourth Amendment, in favor of simple and practical policies that defer to officers' actual \n17 \n18  knowledge and experience on the street.  It is a policy that places compassion for \n19 \nsuspects' difficulties and conditions (perhaps not misplaced in other contexts) squarely at \n20 \nodds with Plaintiffs' and the publics' safety.  As courts consistently hold: a threat of \n21 \ndanger is a threat of danger, regardless of the suspect's mental or other impairments that \n22 \nmay be contributing factors to a suspect's dangerous criminal behavior. \n23 \n24  7.  Not surprisingly, there is already evidence of significant problems wrought by the new \n25 \nUF Policy. Aside from evidence that officers are hesitating and/or failing to use \n26 \nappropriate and lawfully justified force to address threats safely and effectively, there is \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  6 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 7 of 80\nevidence of a dramatic decrease in proactive police work to investigate and stop crime. \nOfficers are turning in their TASERS in large numbers - even though such devises \nprovide reasonable and effective tools when facing threatening conduct - because \nPlaintiffs are confused about how and when we can use them and see too great a \npossibility for unreasonable discipline under the UF Policy.  Patrols officers will testify \nto an insidious new hesitation to respond to calls for backup.  We are increasingly unsure \nhow much help we can offer since our responses are so burdened and constrained by the \nUF Policy, and whether or not providing backup is worth the risk of unreasonable \ndisciplinary action or termination.  This hesitation has only increased as, Plaintiffs will \ntestify, we are now being brought in to headquarters like criminal suspects and subjected \nto intimidating, non-consensual recorded interviews for conduct that was widely \naccepted as effective and lawful policing just a few months ago.  Meanwhile, first \nresponding officers, required by the UF Policy to delay and avoid immediately resorting \nto force, are left unnecessarily and unreasonably vulnerable when backup fails to come, \nand the delay and avoidance tactics fail to bring the threat under control.  Plaintiffs will \npresent evidence of a significant increase, that began even before the policy became \nfinal, in injuries to patrol officers because we are hesitating to respond to threats with \nadequate and reasonable force. \nCitizens are feeling vulnerable as patrol officers avoid acting in reasonable response to \nthreats to public safety.  Publicized cases include incidents where officers have done \nnothing, or retreated from suspects who threatened the officer with death or serious \nphysical injury, leaving the officer, other officers on the scene, and the public \nunnecessarily exposed to serious danger or death.  Not surprisingly, in published articles, \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  7 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 8 of 80\nbystanders have expressed anger and concern at what they see as sworn officers' failure \nto protect innocent people.  The bold, new disregard for police authority in the streets of \nSeattle - as evidenced, for example, by a recent letter by more than 40 individuals and \nofficials who wrote to the Mayor asking for immediate enforcement resources to deal \nwith increasingly violent incidents downtown - is the natural and logical consequence of \na policy that so decisively places the interests of criminal suspects ahead of the rights and \ninterests of officers, citizens, and the City. \nThere are other serious risks to Plaintiffs' safety created by the new UF Policy.  It is so \nlong, complex and contradictory that Washington State Criminal Justice Training \nCommission (CJTC) personnel have stated that they have no idea how to conduct \ntraining for it, and therefore will not.  Plaintiffs will testify to being significantly less sure \nof how to police under the new UF Policy even than when we first became police \nofficers.  Moreover, as the new policy is implemented, it is becoming increasing clear \nthat our fears are in fact the new reality:  We are being judged under an impossible \nstandard that puts our lives at unnecessary and therefore unreasonable risk.  Plaintiffs \nhave taken the opportunity to observe meetings of the Use afForce Review Board \n(UFRB) which, under the new policy, is required to review every Type II and III UF \nincident.  This includes, for example, any time a patrol officer takes down a suspect in \norder to arrest him or her, and the suspect \"complains\" that there was an injury (as the \noverwhelming majority of criminal suspects reflexively and glibly do when placed under \narrest).  In specific cases where patrol officers have had practical, safety reasons for their \nconduct due to the danger of the situation and threat created by the suspect, the Monitor, \nwho was in attendance, emphatically stated: \"Practical considerations never trump this \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  8 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 9 of 80\npolicy.\"  This is completely wrong, and a 180 degree contortion of the Court's holdings \n1  which consistently prioritize officer safety over mechanical applications of policy, \n2 \nparticularly when the suspect has engaged in unlawful threatening behavior. \n3 \n10. What has become increasingly clear is that the new standard for police conduct under the \n4 \nUF Policy is perfection, as determined in 20/20 hindsight by inexperienced, untrained \n5 \n6  civilians and non-patrol officers from the safety of a desk or committee room.  This \n7 \nstandard of perfection was expressed previously by Defendant McGinn in his \"Vision for \n8 \nthe Future,\" when he promised that Seattle police officers using force \"will get it right \n9 \nevery time.\"  Perfection, however, is totally at odds with the Constitution. Perfection can \n10 \nnever be a realistic, fair, or appropriate standard when patrol officers are required to \n11 \n12  regularly confront, and protect the public from, people who commit crime, abuse drugs \n13 \nand alcohol, fail to take prescribed medications, behave violently, have access to \n14 \ndangerous weapons, are often mentally ill, and do not care whether or not their actions \n15 \nconform with the law or the rules of society.  Requiring the impossible of patrol officers \n16 \nwill result in less effective policing and in unreasonable and unnecessary risks to our \n17 \n18  lives and livelihood. \n19 \n11.  These are not problems that can be tweaked, adjusted to, or trained around, with \"self \n20 \nanalysis,\" over some arbitrary transitional period, as suggested by the Monitor. As the \n21 \nallegations of this Complaint make clear, serious misinterpretations and misapplications \n22 \nof long-standing legal principles -and the unconstitutional risks created thereby - are at \n23 \n24  the core of the new policy and impact every aspect of it. \n25 \n12. These pervasive and systemic problems have been created, ironically, in response to \n26 \nDOJ's highly suspect evidence of alleged excessive force, and even though DOJ's \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  9 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 10 of 80\nfmdings themselves make clear that excessive use of force is an issue -if at all -only for \n1  a tiny minority of SPD officers.  DOJ demanded and imposed the new UF Policy, \n2 \nacknowledging that almost all the cases where it alleged excessive use of force \n3 \n\"involve[d ) people with mental illness, or people under the influence of drugs and \n4 \nalcohol.\"  It then ignored the consistent and cumulative evidence regarding the \n5 \n6  magnitude of the crisis involving untreated mentally ill individuals in urban areas across \n7  the United States, and the intersection between untreated mental illness and drug abuse, \n8 \ndangerous and unpredictable behavior, and violence involving guns and other deadly \n9 \ninstruments.  DOJ demanded policy changes without meaningful consideration of \n10 \nrecognized use of force science, which consistently discredits the core \"pause and \n11 \n12  deliberate\" strategies imposed by DOJ. It also ignored research regarding both the \n13 \nphysiology of decision-making under tense, uncertain, and rapidly unfolding \n14 \ncircumstances, and the disadvantage facing officers who, by definition, operate behind \n15 \nthe reactionary curve when they are called to respond to the threatening conduct and \n16 \nbehavior of suspects.  Most significantly - considering DOJ's role as the Nation's enforcer \n17 \n18  of the Constitution -DOJ made its findings and imposed its remedy without regard for \n19 \nthe longstanding standards regarding use of force under that very Constitution. \n20 \n13. As sworn police officers, we have undertaken a dangerous occupation, and each day we \n21 \nknowingly accept its accompanying risks.  We participate in continuing and extensive \n22 \ntraining regarding suspects' rights and have never sought a blank check on using force. \n23 \n24  Nor are we insensitive to the problems facing the mentally ill. In fact, we are uniquely \n25 \ncalled upon to cope with their plight first-hand, every day.  What this Complaint alleges \n26 \nis that we cannot be required to take unnecessary and, therefore, unreasonable risks with \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  10 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 11 of 80\nour lives and our safety.  That, while we consistently are called to the scene of the \n1  dangerous epicenter of a societal crisis not of our making, we cannot be required to \n2 \nrespond as \"mental health professionals\"- which we are not- and at the same time be \n3 \nunreasonably burdened from using our lawful authority and force - the unique and \n4 \ncrucial skills we bring to the crisis - in order to protect ourselves and the public. \n5 \n6  14.  The danger DOJ created when it demanded a new UF policy - disregarding any input \n7 \nfrom or the experience of patrol officers, especially in Seattle, and without regard for the \n8 \nlongstanding rule of law or the appropriate role of the police - is the most serious threat \n9 \nto officer and public safety faced by the City in years, and, if not immediately rectified, \n10 \nwill negatively impact the City for decades to come. \n11 \n12  IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n13 \n15. On December 17,2013, Judge Robart, United States District Court Judge for the Western \n14 \nDistrict of Washington at Seattle, issued an order approving an alleged \"Consensus Use of Force \n15 \nPolicy\" (UF Policy) to govern SPD.  The court approved the policy as appropriate \"for the \n16 \n17  present circumstances.\"  Judge Robart indicated that his role was to insure that the UF Policy \n18  was constitutional.  However, his cursory, one-and-one-half page order, contains no substantive \n19 \nanalysis of the UF Policy or its constitutionality, and, in fact, statements in the opinion contradict \n20 \nwell-established case law on how police officers are supposed to make determinations regarding \n21 \nthe lawfulness and reasonableness of their actions. The UF Policy went into effect on January 1, \n22 \n23  2014. \n24  16. The \"circumstances\" referred to by Judge Robart include an investigation opened in March, 2011 \n25 \nby Defendant Thomas E. Perez, former Assistant Attorney General (AAG) of the Civil Rights \n26 \nDivision of DOJ regarding whether or not SPD officers deprived individuals of their \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  11 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 12 of 80\nconstitutional rights by patterns and practices of discriminatory policing or excessive use of \n1  force.  After its investigation, DOJ was unable to make any findings of discriminatory \n2 \npolicing.  However, DOJ issued findings (Findings Letter), including that when SPD patrol \n3 \nofficers use force \"they do so in an unconstitutional manner nearly 20% of the time.\" \n4 \nSubsequently in July 2012, a Settlement Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding \n5 \n6  (Consent Agreement) was entered into between the United States, SPD and the City.  In the \n7 \nConsent Agreement, SPD and the City specifically \"dispute[d] the alleged patterns or \n8 \npractices of excessive force alleged in DOJ's report.\"  Nevertheless, they agreed to develop a \n9 \nnew UF policy consistent with the constitutional requirements of Graham v. Connor.  The \n10 \nConsent Agreement also provided that the parties would select a federal monitor to oversee \n11 \n12  implementation of the Consent Agreement.  Defendant Merrick Bobb (Monitor) is the monitor \n13 \nselected by the parties.  The Monitor publicizes his work on a website called the \"Website of the \n14 \nSeattle Police Monitor,\" and his salary is paid by the City.  The City to date has paid the Monitor \n15 \nand his staff (Monitoring Team) over $700,000.00.  On November 27, 2013 the Monitor \n16 \nsubmitted the UF Policy approved by Judge Robart, with an accompanying Memorandum to the \n17 \n18  Court (UF Memorandum), alleging that the policy met the requirements of the Consent Decree. \n19 \n17. Plaintiffs are primarily SPD patrol officers, and are the individuals most significantly and \n20 \nimmediately affected by the new UF Policy. We are also the individuals with the most \n21 \nknowledge, training and experience regarding the UF situations facing patrol officers in Seattle. \n22 \nMoreover, many SPD patrol officers are established and recognized experts in use of force \n23 \n24  techniques, practices and standards.  Nevertheless, no SPD officers concurrently engaged in \n25 \nstreet policing duties were involved in the development of the UF Policy. DOJ and the monitor \n26 \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  12 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 13 of 80\nchoose instead, inexplicably, to consult the \"rank-and-file in Los Angeles\" to determine if the \n1  new policies \"compromise[d] the safety of Seattle police officers and the public they serve.\" \n2 \n18. In the very last days of the process, select Plaintiffs were invited to submit comments through \n3 \nthe Seattle Police Officers' Guild (SPOG) and a departmental website called, Idea Scale. \n4 \nHowever, it soon became clear that they were solicited without any intention of affecting \n5 \n6  decisions already made by the Monitor and DOJ.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs provided a thorough \n7  review of the draft and identified how and where the draft policy conflicted with use of force \n8 \nbest practices, the realities facing patrol officers on the streets of Seattle, and the protections \n9 \nafforded officers under the Second, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  These concerns were \n10 \nignored.  Plaintiffs again attempted to communicate their concerns to those involved in the \n11 \n12  process, before the draft became a final policy.  Plaintiffs were told, in effect:  \"This is what DOJ \n13 \nand the Monitor are telling SPD to do regardless of whether or not it makes good sense or is \n14 \ngood law.  A federal judge has approved it. There's nothing SPD can do about it. It's a 'done \n15 \ndeal.\"' \n16 \n19. The Monitor's UF Memorandum claims that the UF Policy represents a 'consensus' and 'unified \n17 \n18  voice.'  This is inaccurate to the point of falsification.  As almost every other statement in the UF \n19 \nMemorandum acknowledges, there has been, and Plaintiffs allege continues to be, a profound \n20 \nlack of consensus around the UF Policy. As is made clear above, despite Plaintiffs' vital role in \n21 \nthe implementation of, and our significant impact from, the UF Policy, we were not even a party \n22 \nto the supposed 'contentious' and 'exhausting' negotiations the Monitor claims led to the final \n23 \n24  consensus on the new UF policy. Patrol officers were never meaningfully consulted during the \n25 \nprocess, and our Guild, though allegedly \"consulted\" by the Monitor, was not a party to, or at the \n26 \ntable for, official decisions regarding significant, fundamental rights and interests of its \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  13 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 14 of 80\nmembers.  Plaintiffs contend that any appearance of 'consensus' asserted by the Monitor is \n1  simply due to the fact that he ran roughshod over any criticism and concerns, and that the \n2 \nvarious involved parties simply gave up.  This reality is reflected in the tone of the Monitor's \n3 \nsemiannual reports, which are self-serving, combative, and bullying. It is now clear that the \n4 \nMonitor and DOJ all along intended to use SPD and the City as a test-case to re-write \n5 \n6  longstanding constitutional law and principles - and to undermine reasonable police practices \n7  based on these principles - with which they disagree. \n8 \n20. Defendant, Eric H. Holder, Jr., is theAG of the United States, and it was on his behalfthe \n9 \nConsent Agreement was signed by Defendant Perez and Defendant Jenny S. Durkan, US \n10 \nAttorney, Western District of Washington.  Defendants Perez, Durkan and Defendant, Jonathan \n11 \n12  Smith, Chief of Special Litigation for DOJ worked closely with the Mayor's office to develop \n13 \nthe Consent Agreement and the subsequent UF Policy, as did other members of the Special \n14 \nLitigation Section, including Defendants Emily Gunston and Timothy Mygatt.  DOJ continues to \n15 \nbe involved in the implementation of, and training under, the new policy. Defendant Jocelyn \n16 \nSamuels is the current Acting AAG for Civil Rights. \n17 \n18  21. Defendant Michael McGinn is the former Mayor of Seattle, and Defendant Peter Holmes is the \n19 \nSeattle City Attorney, each of whom signed the Consent Agreement on behalf of the City. \n20 \nDefendant Edward B.

CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS \n1 \nA.  Plaintiffs Have the Right to Self-Defense and Defense of Others Under the Second \nand Fourth Amendments and These Rights are Violated by the UF Policy. \n2 \n3  1.  When a police officer is confronted with threatening behavior, he or she has the fundamental, \n4 \nindividual right of self-defense under the Second Amendment, consistent with every other \n5 \ncitizen, to protect himself or herself, and others, from apparent and immediate harm. As the \n6 \nCourt has long recognized, the rules that define and determine self-defense are of universal \n7 \n8  application and are not affected by the character of a person's employment. Indeed, where \n9  employees have a duty to protect others, their right to defend themselves and others is arguably \n10 \nenhanced. In many ways, these rights closely overlap patrol officers' rights to use force under the \n11 \nFourth Amendment, especially when defending themselves against suspects who pose an \n12 \nimmediate threat to their safety or the safety of others. \n13 \n14  2.  However, distinct from the Fourth Amendment standard of'objective reasonableness' is a long \n15  tradition of self-defense law that establishes a 'reasonable belief standard. As such, there need \n16 \nonly be 'reasonable grounds' for a person's belief that he or she is in imminent or immediate \n17 \ndanger at the time of the acts in self-defense or defense of others.  Like objective reasonableness, \n18 \nthe reasonable belief standard does not rest on the 'actual facts' of the situation, but rather on the \n19 \n20  'apparent danger' perceived by the individual acting in defense of self or others.  Moreover, \n21 \nunder the Second Amendment, the more serious the apparent danger perceived at the moment of \n22 \nself-defense or defense of others, the less detached or 'objective' the test of reasonableness has to \n23 \nbe. \n24 \n3.  As discussed in detail in section VI.A below, the UF Policy, particularly the deadly force \n25 \n26  provision, violates Plaintiffs' rights and protections secured by theses standards under the \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  15 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 16 of 80\nSecond Amendment.  We state again, we are not seeking unfettered, unregulated permission to \n1  use force.  Our complaint is against the situation created by the UF Policy whereby sworn patrol \n2 \nofficers are placed at unreasonable risk and disadvantage vis-a-vis suspects who threaten deadly \n3 \nharm or serious bodily injury.  Moreover officers are placed at a disadvantage in protecting \n4 \nthemselves and the public compared to ordinary citizens, notwithstanding that officers are given \n5 \n6  both the trust and responsibility to respond to and protect the public from danger. \n7 \nB.  Police Officers have Constitutional Protections under the Fourth Amendment, \nDistinct from the Interests of the Government, and/or the Rights of the Citizens and \n8 \nThese Protections are Unreasonably Burdened by the UF Policy. \n9 \n1.  The Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence -the core legal parameters that guide \n10 \npolice interactions with persons engaged, or suspected of engagement, in criminal activity -\n11 \n12  contains clear and longstanding standards and principles regarding seizures by police officers. \n13 \nIn fact, force is itself a seizure, and therefore subject to the same requirements for reasonable \n14 \nsuspicion and probable cause as all other seizures.  The Fourth Amendment balances three \n15 \ndistinct sets of interests when considering the reasonableness of an officer's decision to make a \n16 \nseizure:  (1) the private citizen's interests against unreasonable intrusion by the government; (2) \n17 \n18  the government's interest in detecting, investigating, and preventing crime; and (3) the \"more \n19 \nimmediate interest of the police officer\" in protecting himself or herself and others from danger, \n20 \nbecause it is unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the \n21 \nperformance of their duties.  Thus, the Fourth Amendment gives patrol officers distinct \n22 \nconstitutional protection against being required to take unnecessary risks with their lives and \n23 \n24  safety. \n25 \n2.  Plaintiffs want to be clearly understood.  We know our job puts us in danger.  We willingly \n26 \naccept these risks in large part because our job also allows us the privilege to serve and protect \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  16 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 17 of 80\nthe innocent.  Obviously, we are not arguing that the Constitution grants us the right to dictate, to \n1  our employers, all the terms of a UF Policy. We also are not arguing that the Constitution \n2 \nrequires our employer (SPD and the City) to do the impossible, e.g., control suspects' dangerous \n3 \nbehavior, or keep us at all times safe.  We are arguing that the Constitution provides us certain \n4 \nrights and protections:  Our employer cannot make policy decisions and impose policy \n5 \n6  requirements that put us at unnecessary and, therefore, unreasonable risk when confronting \n7  threatening or resisting suspects, and which require us to take unnecessary and, therefore, \n8 \nunreasonable risks with our safety and the safety of the public we serve.  Longstanding Fourth \n9 \nAmendment case law has worked a careful balance among these rights and interests by \n10 \nexamining the objective reasonableness of the officers' conduct based on the totality of the \n11 \n12  circumstances perceived by that officer at the time force is used, particularly the immediacy of \n13 \nthe threat to the safety of the officers and others.  The UF Policy consistently undermines that \n14 \nbalance, ignoring and discounting the threat presented by suspects, unreasonably restricting and \n15 \nburdening officers' ability to take necessary actions, and requiring officers to take unreasonable \n16 \nrisks.  In doing so, the UF Policy attempts to re-define as 'excessive', force that is reasonable in \n17 \n18  light of the threat to officers' safety at the time, and thus undermines the protections afforded \n19 \npolice officers under the Fourth Amendment's careful scheme. \n20 \nC.  Patrol Officers Are Not Required to Forfeit Their Rights In Order to Obtain, \n21  Retain, or Perform Their Job Under the Fourth and Second Amendments. \n22 \n1.  DOJ, the City and SPD leadership are under the mistaken belief that they can unreasonably \n23 \nrestrict and burden, and subsequently punish Plaintiffs, for using reasonable force allowed by the \n24 \nSecond and Fourth Amendments, in a confrontation between the police and suspects.  Plaintiffs' \n25 \nconstitutional protections against being required to take unreasonable risks, however, are \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  17 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 18 of 80\nincorporated, and apply to the States and municipalities, such as the City and SPD, under the \nFourteenth Amendment. As applies against all Defendants, the Court holds that public \nemployees do not lose Fourth Amendment rights when they work for the government.  Nor are \nthey relegated to watered-down versions of constitutional protections.  Moreover, the Court \nspecifically holds that constitutional protections against unreasonable search or seizures do not \ndisappear because the government employer has the right to make reasonable intrusions or \nimpositions. \nHere Plaintiffs are granted protection under the Second and Fourth Amendments not to be \nrequired to take unreasonable risk with their safety.  It is the unreasonable risk itself that is the \nconstitutional injury, and it is the policy and practices demanded by DOJ and implemented by \nthe City and SPD that have created this risk.  The Fourth Amendment authorizes Plaintiffs to \ntake reasonable action in response to threatening and dangerous conduct by suspects.  While \nsuspects may cause bodily harm and even death to Plaintiffs, it is the intentional conduct of \ngovernment actors that expressly restricts and burdens police officers' authority to take the \nreasonable actions necessary to protect themselves and others from that danger. Thus it is the \nconduct of government actors that have caused unreasonable risk and the constitutional violation \nunder ยง 1983. \nD.  DOJ's Factual Justification for the Alleged Constitutional Violations by SPD Patrol \nOfficers is Speculative, has been Discredited, and therefore cannot Support the \nRemedy Imposed by DOJ. \nThe factual analysis on which DOJ bases its assertion that there existed a pattern and practice of \nunconstitutional, excessive force used by SPD patrol officers has been discredited and is \nincorrect.  DOJ repeatedly refused to provide the City, SPD or the public with the data, methods, \nor analysis it used to reach its conclusion that 20% ofUF situations utilized excessive force.  The \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  18 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 19 of 80\nlittle information DOJ did provide indicates that its key fmding comes from an extrapolation \nfrom a random sample ofUF reports.  It is therefore nothing more than speculation. An \nindependent analysis by researchers under the supervision of Matthew Hickman, a Professor at \nSeattle University, and a former statistician for DOJ itself, examined -in totality -every single \nUF report during the time period that was considered, and extrapolated from, by DOJ.  In stark \ncontrast to DOJ's unsupported assertion, the Hickman study found that only 3.5% of the cases \ncould be characterized as even \"potentially\" excessive. \nIn addition, DOJ's finding regarding the prevalence of excessive force directly conflicts with \nother key findings by DOJ such as: the \"great majority\" of Seattle's police officers do not use \nexcessive force; the pattern of excessive force exists only for a very small \"subset\" of officers; \nthat supervisory oversight should focus only on the \"very small number\" of officers who use \nforce frequently; and that the alleged 20 officers whom DOJ is concerned about represent only \n4% of SPD officers that used force in 2010.  DOJ goes so far as to concede that if there is \nanything, there is only an \"appearance,\" not the reality, of a wide-spread problem, thus refuting \ntheir own conclusions. \nE.  DOJ, SPD, and the City have attempted to Fundamentally Alter the Terms and \nConditions of Plaintiffs' Employment without a Meaningful Opportunity to be heard in \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a federal agency, such as DOJ, from \ndepriving individuals of life, liberty or property without the due process of law.  Similarly, the \ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state actors from doing the same. \nClearly such rights are at stake here.  Plaintiffs believe that the UF Policy requires them to take \nunnecessary and therefore constitutionally unreasonable risks with their safety in the \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  19 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 20 of 80\nperformance of their duties, including subjecting them to unnecessary risks of death and serious \n1 \nbodily injury.  There can be no argument that such deprivation requires due process. \n2 \nFurthermore, even though Plaintiffs recognize that we assume a certain level of risk by accepting \n3 \nemployment as police officers, we do not accept that we must forfeit our constitutional \n4 \nprotections by doing so, nor, therefore, that we can be coerced into assuming unnecessary, \n5 \n6  unreasonable risks.  Moreover, Plaintiffs believe we will face unreasonable disciplinary actions, \n7 \nlawsuits, loss of employment, and the inability to obtain police employment in other \n8 \njurisdictions, if and when we are accused of violating the new UF Policy, even though our \n9 \nactions were reasonable under the law.  Such property interests at issue have been established by \n10 \nstatutes, regulations, SPD procedures, and collective bargaining agreements governing the \n11 \n12  employment relationship between police officers and the City. \n13 \n2.  Notwithstanding these significant and serious liberty and property interests, DOJ has imposed, \n14 \nand the City and SPD have acquiesced, in the fundamental rewriting of nearly universal, \n15 \nlongstanding, constitutionally grounded rules of acceptable, i.e. reasonable, police conduct. \n16 \nThey did so without providing Plaintiffs any meaningful opportunity to be heard, even though it \n17 \n18  is our safety and livelihood that is most significantly and immediately affected by the policy \n19 \nchanges.  They did so without meaningful consultation with or involvement from SPOG.  They \n20 \ndid so notwithstanding that many SPD patrol officers are recognized experts in the field of use of \n21 \nforce standards and techniques.  They ignored Plaintiffs' experience and expertise, even as the \n22 \nMonitor inexplicably consulted with the \"rank and file\" police officers in a different state, a \n23 \n24  different type of city, in a different region of the country.  This is particularly troubling when the \n25 \nconstitutional standard at issue- whether the police officers' conduct was objectively reasonable \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  20 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 21 of 80\n- depends on an examination of the specific knowledge, experience, training and circumstances \n1  facing those officers. \n2 \n3.  A key condition of Plaintiffs' employment is the availability of qualified immunity when officers \n3 \nare sued based on claims that we used excessive force.  This is an essential condition, as patrol \n4 \nofficers are required to respond to dangerous, tense, and uncertain circumstances on a daily \n5 \n6  basis, and the public wants us to do so with confidence in order to protect them.  Qualified \n7  immunity recognizes that to reasonably ask this of police officers, they must be protected from \n8 \nthe fear of unfair lawsuits, particularly in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable \n9 \nforce.  Qualified immunity also recognizes that police officers can act reasonably under the law \n10 \neven when they are mistaken as to the facts and circumstances at the time, or how the law will \n11 \n12  apply to those facts. As discussed below, the UF Policy, by contrast, legislates and requires \n13 \nperfect and exact responses by police in their encounters with dangerous and threatening \n14 \nsuspects.  Such an approach undermines the longstanding totality of the circumstances standard \n15 \nby which officers' conduct should be assessed, and thus throws into question patrol officers' \n16 \nimmunity -a significant right and essential condition of our employment -without any \n17 \n18  meaningful opportunity to be heard. \n19 \nVI. SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS UNDER TITLE 8 (UF Policy) \n20 \n21  A.  The Deadly Force Provisions of the UF Policy Violate Plaintiffs' (Officers') \nConstitutional Rights by Basing the Reasonableness of the Decision to Use Deadly \n22 \nForce on the 'Actual' Facts and Circumstances, instead of those 'Apparent' to the \n23  Officer at the Moment Deadly Force is Used. \n24 \n1.  The new UF provisions, are found in Title 8 of the Seattle Police Manual, a copy of which \n25 \ncan be found on the Monitor's web site: www.seattlemonitor.com.  Under Sec. 8.100.5 of the \n26 \nUF Policy, deadly force may be used only, and without exception, in circumstances where \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  21 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 22 of 80\nthe threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others IS imminent. The UF \n1  Policy then imposes the following conditions on the objective reasonableness standard for \n2 \ndetermining whether or not an imminent danger is PRESENT:  The suspect IS acting in a \n3 \nmanner or threatening to cause death or serious physical injury to the officer; AND the \n4 \nsuspect, in fact, HAS the \"means or instrumentalities;\" AND HAS the \"opportunity and \n5 \n6  ability\" to do so.  These requirements are completely contrary to the overwhelming history of \n7 \nconstitutional precedent that protect a police officer, or citizen, if he or she acts on a \n8 \nmistaken belief regarding the 'actual' facts as long as the officer or citizen had a reasonable \n9 \nbelief in, or acted in an objectively reasonable manner in the face of the 'apparent' danger \n10 \npresented by the suspect at the time.  When patrol officers are categorically restricted in their \n11 \n12  ability to respond to reasonably perceived threats of death or serious physical injury, the \n13 \nprotection and rights granted them by the constitutional principles of self-defense and \n14 \ndefense of others are burdened to the point of destruction in violation of the Second and \n15 \nFourth Amendments. \n16 \n17  2.  Moreover, under the core provision authorizing force, Sec. 8.100, patrol officers are \n18  prohibited, without exception, from using physical force except when \"no reasonably \n19 \neffective alternative appears to exist.\"  Jurisprudence under the Second and Fourth \n20 \nAmendments, however, has consistently made clear that when there is a reasonable belief \n21 \nregarding a threat of death, or serious physical injury, or where the officer's conduct was \n22 \n23  objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances, the Constitution protects him or her for \n24  actions taken in self-defense or defense of others regardless of whether or not there existed \n25 \nless intrusive means, or alternatives to self-defense or defense of others, such as inflicting a \n26 \nless serious injury to, retreating from, or containing, or negotiating with the suspect. \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  22 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 23 of 80\nB.  The UF Policy is Unconstitutional Because Throughout it Forces Patrol Officers to \nUse Less Force Than is Reasonably Required by the Threat, thus Requiring Officers to \n1  Take Unnecessary Risks in the Performance of Their Duties. \n2 \n1.  Under the Second, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, the appearance of an immediate \n3 \nthreat justifies an immediate response with reasonable force.  Anything else, requires \n4 \nofficers to take unnecessary and unreasonable risks in the performance of their duties, and \n5 \n6  the Constitution provides them protection from such risks. \n7  2.  Nevertheless, the core provision authorizing force under the UF Policy, Sec. 8.1 00, \n8 \ncategorically prohibits an officer from using physical force that is reasonable unless, in \n9 \naddition to being reasonable, the force also is necessary -which means the officer has first \n10 \nconsidered all apparent \"reasonably effective alternatives.\"  Yet, even the Ninth Circuit has \n11 \n12  expressly rejected that an officer must first avail himself or herself of all the less, or the least, \n13 \nintrusive alternatives available to him or her, under the reasonableness standard. The Circuit \n14 \nfound that such a requirement would place unreasonable burdens on police officers under the \n15 \nConstitution by demanding superhuman judgment.  In turn this would make them hesitate \n16 \nand be tentative; it would deter them from protecting themselves and others; and it would \n17 \n18  invite endless, unreasonable second-guessing. \n19 \n3.  The policy also makes a wholly new requirement nowhere found in constitutional case law \n20 \nthat force must be \"proportional to the threat\" (Sec. 8.100.1 ).  This is an extra-constitutional \n21 \nrequirement and serves only to add layers of complexity and precision to a standard that the \n22 \nCourt demands, by contrast, be simple and flexible. \n23 \n24  4.  Sec. 8.100.1 also states that: \"proportional force does not require officers to use the same \n25 \ntype or amount of force as the subject.\"  Defendants are likely to argue that this provision \n26 \nallows an officer to retain discretion to use the level of force he or she judges appropriate to \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  23 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 24 of 80\nthe circumstances, even force greater than that threatened by the suspect.  In fact, however, \n1  any such deference to officers' judgment is consistently and overwhelmingly contradicted by \n2 \noperation of other parts of the policy.  For example, officer discretion is overridden by the \n3 \npolicy's requirement throughout that use of force \"shall\" in all cases precisely be \"only the \n4 \ndegree ... necessary.\"  It is also overridden by the policy's explicitly restrictions on officers' \n5 \n6  rights to use certain levels and types of force - even in immediately threatening situations -\n7  unless a variety of other factors, conditions, qualifiers are or are not present, and not before \n8 \nofficers have engaged in the time-consuming mental gymnastics necessary to satisfy all the \n9 \ncomplex and contradictory requirements of the new UF Policy.  The real effect of the policy \n10 \nis to keep patrol officers constantly second-guessing their actions, meanwhile remaining at a \n11 \n12  dangerous force deficit throughout encounters with threatening suspects.  Obviously, this \n13 \nputs Plaintiffs' safety at unreasonable risk whenever we go out on call.  It also means that no \n14 \nmatter what we do, someone can, after-the-fact, point to some provision of the policy and \n15 \nsay we did it wrong.  This puts our livelihood at unreasonable risk. \n16 \n5.  Sec.8.200, categorically and without exception, prohibits officers from using less-lethal tools \n17 \n18  against vaguely defined, newly protected classes of suspects (visibly pregnant, elderly, pre \n19 \nadolescent, visibly frail, or known or suspected to be disabled) absent active aggression, \n20 \nunless deadly force is the only other available option.  These five categories are sufficiently \n21 \nbroad, subjective and vague so as to encompass a broad swath of individuals, and to invite \n22 \nsignificant error in application and improper second-guessing.  Moreover, by operation of \n23 \n24  this rule, an officer cannot use reasonable and effective force tools or techniques (i.e., tools \n25 \nand techniques specifically intended to \"disrupt subject's threatening behavior\" without the \n26 \nprobability of death or serious physical injury) until deadly force is justified.  This makes no \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  24 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 25 of 80\nsense as a matter of public policy.  In the apparent attempt to protect certain groups of \n1  individuals, the UF Policy actually increases the likelihood that such persons will get killed \n2 \nor seriously injured in encounters with the police -a clear violation of those suspects' rights. \n3 \nIt also unreasonably burdens the protections granted police officers under the Fourth \n4 \nAmendment, because it restricts officers from responding with the force reasonably required \n5 \n6  by the circumstances at and from the moment they arrive on the scene. \n7 \n6.  Sec. 8.200.5 also categorically restricts an officer from using these less-lethal tools and \n8 \ntechniques against suspects in another nine (9) sets of circumstances absent active \n9 \naggression.  This means the suspect can be actually resisting, or actively noncompliant with \n10 \nofficer's commands -a potential indication of an intent to do harm to the officer -yet the \n11 \n12  officer cannot, without exception, respond with less-lethal techniques before considering \n13 \nevery \"other fashion\" of reasonable response (e.g. all other alternatives). \n14 \n7.  The UF Policy consistently requires officers ftrst to consider alternatives to force (e.g., Sec. \n15 \n8.000.2 \"officers will de-escalate conflict without using physical force;\" Sec. 8.100.3 \n16 \n\"officers shall use de-escalation tactics\").  It attempts to qualify these provisions in order to \n17 \n18  make them seem reasonable and/or constitutional.  Here, for example, stating that de \n19 \nescalation is required only \"when time and safety permit...\"  Such qualifiers are pretty, but \n20 \nuseless, window dressing at best.  At worst, they add complexity to a policy that is already \n21 \nunwieldy and unworkable to the point of putting officers' lives at risk.  Moreover, they serve \n22 \nto disguise how the policy, taken together as a whole, is out and out wrong.  Specifically, \n23 \n24  officers are told to delay only \"when time and safety permit,\" -this sounds reasonable -but \n25 \nin the very same provision we are required to do the exact opposite and take unreasonable \n26 \nrisk.  This is because we are required by the provision to delay and not use force even though \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  25 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 26 of 80\n(1) our safety has already been compromised by the subject's lack of compliance (i.e., \n1  under Sec. 8.100.3 officers consider not if the subject is non-complaint, but the reasons for \n2 \nthe suspect's \"lack of compliance\"); and (2) there is an immediate threat (\"mitigating the \n3 \nimmediacy of the threat\" is the assumed situation when these rules apply).  Bottom line \n4 \nagain, the UF Policy consistently throws roadblocks in the way of officers lawful and \n5 \n6  reasonable use of force.  Doing so subjects us to unreasonable risks to our safety, and to the \n7  constant, unreasonable threat that we will be sanctioned for performing our job in anything \n8 \nless than a perfect (impossible!) manner under the policy. \n9 \n8.  The UF Policy operates under a mistaken and dangerous assumption that threatening \n10 \nsituations always move in a linear, predictable direction.  It assumes that de-escalation will \n11 \n12  inevitably result in a reduction of the use of force, because additional time and space \n13 \n\"promote more rational decision-making\" by suspects, and because it is better to have more \n14 \ntime for \"more officers or specialty units\" to respond to the scene.  The policy direction \n15 \ncomes directly from DOJ who criticized SPD's training of its officers to quickly \"command \n16 \nand control\" situations, proposing instead that it require its officers to engage in a \"fair fight\" \n17 \n18  with suspects. \n19 \n9.  The constitutional protections and rights afforded police officers, however, certainly do not \n20 \nrely on an assumption that suspected criminals will fight fair or behave rationally.  Moreover, \n21 \nsuch an understanding by DOJ is totally at odds with current research, as well as with \n22 \nofficers' first-hand professional experience, which demonstrates that using decisive force \n23 \n24  early in response to an immediate threat is often what keeps the situation from ending in \n25 \nnecessarily greater uses of force, or tragedy.  The UF Policy is therefore also at odds with the \n26 \nFourth Amendment's core principle, discussed further below, that the reasonableness of aUF \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  26 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 27 of 80\nbe judged only, and in every case, under the totality of the circumstances, from the \n1  perspective of the officer on the scene at the time force is used.  AUF Policy which, as in \n2 \nall the sections discussed above, ties a Plaintiffs hands without regard for the specific \n3 \ncircumstances facing the officer at the moment and without any place for consideration of \n4 \nthe knowledge, training, or experience of the officer, violates this fundamental Fourth \n5 \n6  Amendment principle. \n7  C. The UF Policy is Unconstitutional Because it Establishes Separate Rules for Certain \nCategories of Suspects, and Requires Police Officers to Act as Medical and Mental \n8 \nHealth Professionals Beyond the Reasonable Scope of their Duties and Professional \n9  Qualifications. \n10 \n1.  The Fourth Amendment specifically rejects the application of separate tracks or categorical \n11 \nrules when considering the mentally ill, or any other category of suspect, to determine \n12 \nreasonableness when that suspect is behaving in a threatening or resistant manner. \n13 \nNevertheless, (1) the de-escalation provisions unconstitutionally mandate that an officer's UF \n14 \n15  decision take into account the suspect's mental and physical state, even where the suspect is \n16 \nactively non-compliant; and (2) the Tool Specific provisions unconstitutionally tie an \n17 \nofficer's hands in cases involving five new categories of actively threatening suspects based \n18 \non physical and/or mental conditions.  These parts of the UF Policy seem driven directly by \n19 \nDOrs goal, in all cases, of eliminating use of force against people who are having a mental \n20 \n21  health crisis or who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol; in other words, defining as \n22 \nexcessive any force used against such persons.  This is based on its mistaken notion that \n23 \n\"assessing the appropriate force in light of a subject's mental state is not just smart policing, \n24 \nit is required.\"  DOJ is fundamentally wrong.  Courts hold just the opposite.  The crucial \n25 \nfactor in deciding whether or not there was excessive force is the nature and immediacy of \n26 \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  27 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 28 of 80\nthe threat.  Thus, the Constitution does not allow second-guessing of an officer's UF \n1  decision, even though the officer failed to diagnose mental illness, because requiring \n2 \notherwise is impractical and dangerous.  This cannot be stated too strongly: a threat of \n3 \nharm, is a threat of harm regardless of what mental or physical conditions cause the \n4 \nthreat! \n5 \n6  2.  Moreover, considering even just one of the factors -whether or not the suspect is \n7  experiencing a drug interaction -highlights how extremely problematic these requirements \n8 \nare.  Police officers are not medical or mental health professionals.  It can take doctors and \n9 \nmental health professionals months or years to figure out a patient's diagnosis, drug \n10 \ninteractions, and appropriate means of communication, therapy, and treatment.  Yet the UF \n11 \n12  Policy requires police officers, as a precursor to using reasonable force, to make on-the-spot \n13 \nmental health status evaluations and diagnoses under circumstances that will be, by \n14 \ndefinition (given the suspect's non-compliance), threatening, volatile, and potentially \n15 \ndangerous or deadly. \n16 \n3.  Police are not called to the scene to be therapists or mediators.  They are called by family \n17 \n18  members, potential victims, medical and mental health professionals, and others who are \n19 \nafraid for their safety or the safety of others, precisely because police officers have the \n20 \nclear authority to use decisive force as soon as it is required.  (In fact, in Seattle, fire, \n21 \nmedical, and/or mental health personnel will not respond to the scene to assist or \n22 \ninvoluntarily commit mentally ill patients until patrol officers arrive if there is any potential \n23 \n24  for violence.) AUF policy that disregards the facts and reality of the patrol officer's role \n25 \nwhen dealing with threatening or dangerous behavior is totally at odds with a constitutional \n26 \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  28 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 29 of 80\nscheme that protects and gives deference to the men and women who willingly undertake \n1  that role. \n2 \nD.  The UF Policy's Imposition of Categorical Rules Related to the Mentally Ill and \n3  Other Categories of Suspects Violates the Fourth Amendment Requirement that Use of \nForce be Judged Based on the Experience, Knowledge and Training of the Patrol \n4  Officer on the Scene. \n5 \n1.  The UF Policy's categorical, special treatment of mentally ill suspects or those impaired by \n6 \ndrug use or other conditions, flies in the face of the knowledge, training, and experience of \n7 \nworking patrol officers who interact with these individuals on a daily and weekly basis. \n8 \n9  Consideration of, and deference to, such knowledge, training and experience is mandated by \n10 \nthe Fourth Amendment.  Throughout its Findings Letter, DOJ consistently identified erratic \n11 \nand non-compliant behavior by suspects as deserving of \"special,\" gentle handling. \n12 \nHowever, patrol officers and experts in the field of policing across the country, understand \n13 \nthat the exact behavior DOJ identifies as benign (yelling expletives at oneself, staring into \n14 \n15  space, bulging eyes, sweating, balled fists, disregarding or refusing officer commands, taking \n16 \noff pieces of clothing) can be, and often is in fact, evidence of Excited Delirium and/or \n17 \n\"boiling point,\" pre-attack indicators, i.e. evidence that a suspect's behavior is not only not \n18 \nbenign, but likely to become violent and rapidly escalate his or her attack on officers or the \n19 \npublic. \n20 \n21  2.  Research also shows a strong correlation between mental illness and the use and abuse of \n22 \ndrugs.  It shows that drug abuse, in turn, is strongly correlated with violent behavior and that \n23 \ndrug abusers do not respond to usual norms of behavior as suggested by DOJ's and SPD's de-\n24 \nescalation requirements.  What is relevant is what Plaintiffs have learned from their years of \n25 \ntraining and experience on patrol. The Fourth Amendment does not permit judges, or in this \n26 \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  29 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 30 of 80\ncase DOJ and its Monitor, to look back in perfect hindsight, from the safety of their \n1  chambers or offices, to second-guess what patrol officers actually faced at the moment and \n2 \nknow from real experience on the streets. Nor does it permit, as has happened here, aUF \n3 \nPolicy to be based on the experience of officers in another jurisdiction over a thousand miles \n4 \naway.  The Monitor absurdly consulted the \"rank-in-file in Los Angeles\" to determine if the \n5 \n6  UF Policy would keep Seattle patrol officers safe.  Moreover, it is clear from the background \n7  of the so-called police experts on the Monitoring Team, that it has been years since they, if \n8 \never, made actual UF decisions in the line of duty. \n9 \n3.  It is too easy for DOJ attorneys and consultants- or even police officers who spend time at \n10 \ndesks writing policy, performing administrative functions, or even training officers in the \n11 \n12  practice hall -to forget the reality facing officers on the street.  It is too easy for those not \n13 \ndoing the job, to discount how frequently Plaintiffs are called, how threatening it feels, and \n14 \nhow objectively dangerous it is, for example, to respond to a 911 call and find a \n15 \nschizophrenic man who has stopped taking his medications, threatening to hurt family \n16 \nmembers, himself, innocent bystanders, or the officers, and who has ready access to weapons \n17 \n18  or other objects that can be easily used with serious or deadly effect.  The Constitution, by \n19 \ncontrast, offers Plaintiffs protection for precisely these reasons, giving deference to the \n20 \nreasonable judgments and actions of patrol officers facing just such circumstances. \n21 \nE. The UF Policy is Unduly Burdensome and Confusing, Forcing Officers to Consider \n22 \nso Many Factors, in the Heat of the Moment, that Timely and Reasonable Judgments \nin the Face of Threats Becomes Virtually Impossible, Requiring Officers to Take \n23 \nUnnecessary Risks in the Performance of Their Duties. \n24 \nI.  Under the Fourth Amendment cases leading up to Graham, as well as its progeny, the right \n25 \nof the officer to make arrests and investigatory stops necessarily carries with it the right to \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  30 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 31 of 80\nuse some degree of force, as long as its reasonable in inception and scope.  The standard for \n1  whether or not force is excessive is also clear and longstanding:  Were the officers' actions \n2 \nobjectively reason~ble in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them at the \n3 \nmoment force was used?  The most important single factor in determining whether use of \n4 \nforce is reasonable, and therefore whether the officer's conduct is protected by the \n5 \n6  Constitution, is whether or not the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the \n7 \nofficer or others.  This is because the safety of the officer and others is the critical issue. \n8 \nFourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes that officers often enter unpredictable, \n9 \nthreatening situations, and, under the stress of often extreme circumstances, must do their \n10 \nbest to keep everyone safe and unharmed, while also being knowledgeable and responsive to \n11 \n12  the constitutional rights of all the parties involved, including those of the suspect. \n13 \n2.  Given the difficulty of the task, the Constitution demands that the principles and process \n14 \nregarding UF decision-making, just like those for all seizures, must be fluid, flexible, \n15 \npractical, simple, clear, non-technical, and based on common sense, i.e. useful to the officer \n16 \nin his or her work on the street, even if not necessarily useful to legal technicians in the \n17 \n18  safety of their chambers and offices.  The principles, policies and practices must be ones that \n19 \ncan be applied consistent with an officer's need to make split-second decisions, under an \n20 \nindefinite variety of situations and threats, in tense, dangerous, and rapidly unfolding \n21 \ncircumstances.  DOJ found that SPD's previous UF policy was \"vague.\" Yet, the Court has \n22 \nexpressly rejected such a concern.  The Court acknowledges that reasonable suspicion and \n23 \n24  probable cause as determined by the totality-of-the-circumstances standard can appear vague \n25 \nor elusive, but has repeatedly held that it is the only standard that can be practical and useful \n26 \nto officers in the field. \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  31 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 32 of 80\n3.  Standards are not useful, and therefore not constitutional, when they distort this approach by, \n1  for example, being overly specific, complicated, categorical, mechanical, or a neat set of \n2 \nrules, even if they purport to be helpful by giving officers an \"easy to apply\" legal test. \n3 \nPrecise mechanical rules can never substitute for flexibility and experience, as there is \n4 \nnothing predictable, easy, or neat about what a patrol officer faces when he or she responds \n5 \n6  to a volatile call, which may require that force be used.  Reality simply does not lend itself to \n7 \nbeing divided up and pigeon-holed into neat, clearly defined and immediately discernible \n8 \ncategories, according to precise bright-line, mechanistic rules.  Notwithstanding years of \n9 \ncases to this effect, the new UF Policy attempts precision and specificity.  Accordingly, we \n10 \nhave ended up with a policy that complicates, confuses, and undermines how officers \n11 \n12  realistically can make these judgments and how those judgments will be analyzed and \n13 \nreviewed after-the-fact. \n14 \na.  The UF Policy is Overly Complicated. \n15 \n1.  Contrary to this mandate for simplicity and flexibility, Judge Robart approved what he \n16 \nacknowledged is a \"comprehensive\" and \"specific\" policy.  Yet, on its face, a policy \n17 \n18  cannot be useful to patrol officers facing dangers and making split-second decisions, when \n19 \nthat policy is over 60 pages long!  And requires an additional, new 50-page manual for SPD \n20 \ninvestigators to explain how to investigate UF under the new policy. \n21 \n2.  Consider the crucial Sec. 8.100 regarding when force is authorized.  The policy deceptively \n22 \nstates the underlying law correctly: An officer uses only reasonable force \"based on the \n23 \n24  totality of the circumstances known by the officer at the time of the use of force;\"  it must be \n25 \n\"judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 \n26 \nvision of hindsight;\" and the assessment must \"embody allowance for the fact that officers \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  32 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 33 of 80\nare often forced to make split-second decisions--in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, \n1 \nand rapidly evolving.\"  However, the UF Policy then operates to undermine everything it \n2 \njust stated.  First, it promulgates a set of 12 separate, multi-layered, non-exclusive factors \n3 \nthat must be considered by the officer to determine reasonableness. (Graham lists three.)  It \n4 \nthen requires officers also to apply two extra-constitutional requirements (necessity and \n5 \n6  proportionality) discussed in detail in Sec. B. 2. above.  Next, the policy establishes five \n7 \nsituations in which force is categorically prohibited (Sec. 8.100.2).  In addition, the officer \n8 \nmust consider seven factors related to suspects' mental and physical behavior that must be \n9 \n\"balanced\" in an officer's decision-making process.  If the policy is not be an exercise in \n10 \nsecond-guessing, as it purports not to be, these 26 factors, requirements and situations all \n11 \n12  must be considered and evaluated, and the officer's response must be calibrated accordingly, \n13 \nin the \"split-second\" the officer has to make the decision whether or not to use force in the \n14 \nface of threatening behavior.  This is an impossible task.  It makes a mockery of the \n15 \nprotections granted by the Fourth Amendment to police officers' reasonable judgments and \n16 \nactions in the heat of the moment. \n17 \n18  3.  Incredibly, these multi-layered and multi-factored analyses address only the initial question \n19 \nof whether or not force can be used.  Under Sec. 8.000.3, the officer must then consider his \n20 \nor her prior conduct to determine the level of force he or she is permitted to use. Also under \n21 \nSec. 8.200, the patrol officer has to assess whether or not a suspect falls into any of five \n22 \ncategories before being permitted to use a certain level of force.  After engaging in that \n23 \n24  fraught-with-potential-for-error assessment of suspects, the officer must also know and \n25 \nfactor in, under Sec. 8.200- POL 1-10, another 13 pages of detailed rules regarding ten \n26 \nspecific tools and techniques, again, by definition, under tense, uncertain, and rapidly \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  33 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 34 of 80\nevolving circumstance.  The UF Policy operates to defY reason, common sense, and the \n1  protections and rights given Plaintiffs under the Constitution. \n2 \n4.  The policy contains yet another complex, mechanical scheme related to the reporting and \n3 \ninvestigation of UF incidents. The new policy creates four categories of types of force (ยง \n4 \n8.050). In addition, it creates a four-part classification of types of injuries(ยง 8.050).  Finally, \n5 \n6  it creates detailed rules for ten specific force tools (ยง8.200-POL-1-10). Underยง 8.300-\n7  POL-1, the policy creates a complex overlay that combines, type of force, type of injury, and \n8 \ntype of force tool, to create different categories of reporting requirements for officers and \n9 \nscreening requirement for supervisors.  As the the policy also requires throughout that \n10 \nofficers justify each and every separate force application, see e.g., ยงยง 8.200-POL-1.11; \n11 \n12  8.200-POL-3.9; 8.200-POL-5.6; 8.200-POL-6.5, officers must somehow ensure they are \n13 \ncognizant of this complex system even as they make UF decisions in the split-second \n14 \nrequired in the face of suspects' threatening behavior. \n15 \n5.  Moreover, the factors that the officer uses to justify, and that supervisors, commanders, and \n16 \ncitizens use to review, the use of force must be the same factors the officer uses to make his \n17 \n18  force judgments and decisions on the scene.  If factors are too complicated and contradictory \n19 \nto facilitate reasonable decisions in the heat of the moment, then they cannot be used, after \n20 \nthe-fact, to invalidate the officer's judgment and conduct. This is constitutionally \n21 \nunreasonable, though clearly what is mandated by the reporting and review provisions of the \n22 \npolicy. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  34 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 35 of 80\nb. The UF Policy Applies Segmented and Deconstructive Rules to Officers' \nJudgments in Violation of the Fourth (and Second) Amendments. \n1 \n1.  The UF Policy violates the protections granted patrol offers under the Fourth Amendment by \n2 \n3  requiring both analysis ofthe officer's prior conduct, and a post-hoc, point-by-point critique \n4 \nof the incident.  These work together to invalidate the totality standard's focus on \"the \n5 \ncircumstances confronting the officer\" ... \"at the moment\" force was used.  For example, \n6 \nunder Sec. 8.000.3, patrol officers are warned that \"their conduct prior to the use of force,\" \n7 \nincluding the \"display of a weapon,\" can be a factor in determining whether or not the \n8 \n9  subsequent use of force was necessary (again ignoring that the constitutional test is \n10 \n\"reasonableness\").  This expressly contradicts the Ninth Circuit and other circuits holding \n11 \nthat conduct preceding the seizure, including alleged 'tactical errors' (as determined, by \n12 \ndefinition, only in 20/20 hindsight) is irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis of \n13 \nreasonableness. \n14 \n15  2.  Moreover, it makes no sense to the reality of the officer's experience.  Officers routinely have \n16 \ntheir frrearms out and at the ready when, for example, they search and clear a building, or \n17 \napproach suspects during high-risk vehicle stops.  In such cases, the threat is the uncertainty, \n18 \nand officers need to be armed and ready, because they are always behind the reactionary \n19 \ncurve of a potential suspect who has decided to shoot, stab, slash, or smash as a means of \n20 \n21  resistance or escape.  The fact that the officer displaying his gun may have caused a suspect \n22 \nto respond by pulling out his gun is absolutely irrelevant to what happens next.  Just like any \n23 \nother citizen, an officer facing a threat of death or serious physical injury may reasonably \n24 \nrespond to that threat with deadly force.  The new UF Policy creates questions and \n25 \n26 \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  35 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 36 of 80\nuncertainties as to the validity of long-standing and time-tested police practices and \n1  protocols, which are intended to protect officers from unnecessary risks. \n2 \n3.  Under Sec. 800.3, officers are also required to \"continually assess the situation\" and \n3 \n\"modulate the use-of-force appropriately.\"  In addition, throughout Sec. 8.200-POL-1-10, \n4 \nofficers are required to \"justify\" and \"report\" each separate use of a less lethal device during \n5 \n6  a single incident, including that \"each subsequent application of force is a separate \n7 \napplication of force that must be individually justified.\"  Under Sec. 8.300, officers are \n8 \nrequired to document, and supervisors are required to review, in all but de minimis force, \n9 \neach and every blow or application of force.  (Sec. 8.300-POL-1, 8.300-POL-1.1) We know \n10 \nfrom DOJ's findings in its similar review of use of force by the Portland Police Bureau, that \n11 \n12  DOJ explicitly advocates a \"segmented approach\" to use of force claims, whereby \n13 \nsupervisors consider, after-the-fact, \"each point when an officer made a decision that may \n14 \nhave an effect on subsequent events\"  -the ostensible point here allegedly being to allow \n15 \n\"intensive\" reviews of the reasonableness of the officer's conduct in order to identify \"flawed \n16 \ntactical decisions.\" \n17 \n18  4.  It should be noted that, by DOJ's own words noted above, it is admitting that its approach to \n19 \nUF review is expressly designed to lead to unconstitutional second-guessing, 20/20 hindsight \n20 \ncritiques, Monday Morning Quarterbacking, or whatever other description one prefers to \n21 \nemploy.  However, such a \"divide and conquer,\" reductionist analysis has been expressly and \n22 \nrepeatedly rejected by the Court.  The Fourth Amendment looks at UF as a continuous event \n23 \n24  until the threat is decisively stopped or contained.  Thus, the officer's judgment and actions \n25 \nmust be assessed cumulatively, i.e., as a whole picture taken together, without imposing a \n26 \nsequencing of distinct events in order to poke holes and find flaws, or to explain away each \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  36 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 37 of 80\nelement in an officer's cumulative judgment as innocent and thus, not relevant, in and by \n1  itself.  Such an unconstitutional method has no other aim than post hoc analysis and \n2 \njudgment in an effort to undermine the protection and deference granted officers' judgments \n3 \nby the Constitution. \n4 \nc. The UF Policy Improperly Applies Precise and Mechanical Defmitions to \n5 \nthe Test of Reasonableness. \n6 \n1.  Fourth Amendment case law is quite clear.  The test of reasonableness is not capable of \n7 \nprecise defmition or mechanical application.  In violation of this tenet, the UF Policy is \n8 \n9  littered with overly precise definitions and mechanical requirements. For example, \n10 \nthroughout the UF Policy, officers \"shall use only the degree of force ... \" (e.g., 8.000.4). \n11 \nThis type of precision and quantification is impossible and not at all demanded by the \n12 \nreasonableness standard. It is in fact explicitly rejected Under Sec. 8.1 00.6, the UF Policy \n13 \nestablishes an inclusive and rigid 3-part rule for fleeing felons, including, a verbal warning \n14 \n15  requirement, notwithstanding that the Court has specifically rejected just such rigid rule(s). \n16 \nIn these circumstances, as in all cases of force, the officer's conduct must be evaluated based \n17 \non one flexible standard: was it objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances as they \n18 \nappeared to the officer at the time of the incident? Any other mechanical test undermines the \n19 \nprotections granted police officers not to take unnecessary and therefore unreasonable risks \n20 \n21  with their safety or the safety of others. \n22 \n2.  In addition, Sec. 8.050 divides force into qualitatively separate and distinct types.  The \n23 \ncategorical force type is then applied mechanically for purposes of both an officer's decision, \n24 \nand SPD's and the City's after-the-fact analysis and review, to determine whether or not the \n25 \nofficer should be disciplined and/or criminally charged for the UF.  Such a mechanical \n26 \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  37 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 38 of 80\nscheme defming and categorizing levels of force smacks of an attempt to impose a UF \n1 \ncontinuum on SPD.  Requiring officers to pigeon-hole force types before, during, and after \n2 \ntheir decision to use force, complicates and hampers their ability to respond to the particular \n3 \ncircumstances they face.  It also implies that mechanical decisions can always be made \n4 \nregarding when and what force is reasonably required to meet a suspect's threatening \n5 \n6  behavior and/or resistance. Plaintiffs know from experience this is never true. Not \n7 \nsurprisingly, continuums and mechanical schemes have been discredited by law enforcement \n8 \nexperts, even those in other departments of the DOJ itself, as unconstitutional and \n9 \npromoting dangerous, ineffective policing.  Even with so-called 'deadly force', the Court has \n10 \neliminated the notion that there exists a magical on/off switch for determining the type of \n11 \n12  force used by an officer. The only question is: were the officer's actions reasonable in the \n13 \nparticular circumstances as they appeared at the time force was used. \n14 \n15 \nVII. HARM CAUSED AND RELIEF SOUGHT \n16 \nA.  Plaintiffs Claims of Harm are Real, Significant, Immediate and Continuous. \n17 \n18  1.  The dangers and harm cited by Plaintiffs are real, not exaggerated or conjectural.  The \n19 \nConstitution long holds that imposing any standard on police judgment and conduct, other \n20 \nthen the totality of the circumstances standard, creates unnecessary and therefore \n21 \nunreasonable risks to Plaintiffs' safety and the safety of the public.  This unnecessary and \n22 \nunreasonable risk is itself the injury.  Plaintiffs identify the plethora of ways in which the \n23 \n24  UF Policy violates the totality of the circumstances standard, and thus creates unnecessary \n25 \nrisks to their safety each time Plaintiffs go out on a call.  If further evidence of the \n26 \nunnecessary risks created by the policy is useful, Plaintiffs will show numerous incidents \nSPD Officers'ยง 1983 Complaint  38 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 39 of 80\nwhere patrol officers have hesitated or failed to use appropriate levels of force under the \n1  circumstances, including cases where officers have frozen, or retreated from suspects who \n2 \nthreatened the officer with death or serious physical injury.  In these cases the officer(s) and \n3 \npublic were unnecessarily exposed to serious danger or death - and in many cases officers \n4 \nhave been injured - due to the environment, practices, and policies created by the \n5 \n6  Defendants. Patrol officers will testify to greatly increased disregard, provocation, resistance, \n7 \nand threatening belligerence by suspects since the delay and avoidance policy and practices \n8 \nbegan to be imposed.  Instead of creating effective and constitutional policing in Seattle, \n9 \nDOJ has empowered its criminals to openly defy legitimate police authority, and made the \n10 \npolice and public significantly less safe, by producing unconstitutional, ineffective policing. \n11 \n12  2.  Moreover, as DOJ consistently recognizes that there is a national crisis in the mental health \n13 \nsystem affecting, in particular, urban centers such as Seattle, and an inappropriately large \n14 \npart of the burden of this crisis falls on the police.  DOJ also acknowledges that Seattle has \n15 \nseen \"horrific murders committed by mentally ill offenders,\" of both citizens and police \n16 \nofficers. It acknowledges the 2009 unprovoked, unexpected murders of five on-duty, \n17 \n18  uniformed police officers in and around Seattle, and the wounding of a sixth officer.  It \n19 \nclaims, unconvincingly, in light of the rest of its findings, \"not [to have] underestimated the \n20 \nimpact of these events on all police, and particularly on SPD officers.\"  In fact, the mental \n21 \nhealth crisis presents enormous and significant challenges and threats to Seattle police \n22 \nofficers that puts our lives and the lives of innocent bystanders at risk when we cannot \n23 \n24  respond with reasonable force. \n25 \n3.  More generally, FBI's Uniform Crime Reports show, for example, since 2010 between 48 \n26 \nand 72 police officers were feloniously killed each year in the line of duty.  Perhaps more \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  39 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 40 of 80\nsignificantly in each of those years, between 53,000 and 57,000 officers were assaulted by \n1  suspects - or 10 out of every 100 sworn officers - and on average about 27%, or almost one \n2 \nthird of these officers, sustained injuries as a result of the assault.  The dangers to police \n3 \nsafety are real and they are significant.  Every 911 call has the potential to tum harmful or \n4 \ndeadly. \n5 \n6  B. Plaintiffs' Harm Began Before the Final Policy Went Into Effect. \n7  1.  While the actual UF Policy has only been in place since January 2014, the standards \n8 \nreflected in it have been imposed on SPD in practice, by DOJ, since it issued its Findings \n9 \nLetter on December 16, 2011, and quickly became the pattern and practice of what has been \n10 \nrequired of patrol officers since that time.  Officers have already been, as we will continue to \n11 \n12  be, trained to \"pause,\" hesitate, over-think, and under-react to dangerous situations.  What \n13 \nthis means is that the court should consider evidence prior to the UF Policy going into effect \n14 \nwhere Plaintiffs have been required by training or practices to take unnecessary risks with \n15 \ntheir safety and where there have been improper disciplinary actions, loss of paid work, and \n16 \nimproper dismissal from such force. \n17 \n18  C. Plaintiffs Seek an Immediate Injunction and Declaratory Relief. \n19 \n1.  Plaintiff's seek an immediate injunction against the implementation ofSPD's UF Policy that \n20 \nwent into effect on January 1, 2014, and all related training, in light of Plaintiffs' serious and \n21 \nsignificant allegations regarding the unconstitutionality of the UF Policy, and the dangers it \n22 \ncreates to the safety of SPD patrol officers and the public.  The immediacy of this injunction \n23 \n24  is crucial.  Since the intrusion of DOJ in 2011, SPD patrol officers, including new officers at \n25 \nthe Academy ( CJTC), have been -to the extent that any coherent, sensible 'training' is \n26 \npossible under the new policy - improperly trained, or rather, conditioned to hesitate, to wait, \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  40 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 41 of 80\nto not act in the face of threats of danger.  The longer this training/conditioning is ingrained, \n1  the harder it will be to undo, and the safety of officers and the public is further endangered \n2 \nfor years, if not decades, to come. \n3 \n2.  Plaintiffs further seek a declaratory judgment that the UF Policy is unconstitutional and \n4 \nbeyond repair.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration requiring that an entirely new UF policy be \n5 \n6  drafted as soon as possible, but only after obtaining the advice of recognized leading local \n7  and national experts on the science and research related to modern policing and use of force \n8 \ntactics, as well as substantial input from Plaintiffs and other patrol officers with direct \n9 \nexperience in appropriate use of force decision making and tactics in Seattle. In this regard, \n10 \nPlaintiffs ask only that the City and SPD do in fact what they committed to do under the \n11 \n12  Consent Decree, namely draft a UF Policy that is consistent with the constitutional \n13 \nrequirements of Graham. \n14 \nD.  Plaintiffs Seek Compensatory Damages. \n15 \nPlaintiffs seek compensatory damages for lost time and wages, improper disciplinary action, \n16 \nor any other personnel actions taken against Plaintiffs for violations of the UF Policy where \n17 \n18  Plaintiffs acted based on constitutional standards and thus within the protection afforded us \n19 \nby the Fourth Amendment.  Plaintiffs believe it is only a matter of time before this complaint \n20 \nwill be required to be amended to add compensatory damage claims for an officer(s ) \n21 \ndamages related to defending a lawsuit alleging that the officers use of force violated SPD \n22 \npolicy, even though the use of force was reasonable under the Constitution, or more \n23 \n24  significantly, to add a damage claim for the serious injury or wrongful death of a patrol \n25 \nofficer, who was injured or whose life was taken when he or she hesitated or failed to use \n26 \nappropriate force when responding to a dangerous call. \nSPD Officers' ยง 1983 Complaint  41 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00794-MJP   Document 1   Filed 05/28/14   Page 42 of 80\nE. Plaintiffs Seek Punitive Damages \n1  Plaintiffs seek punitive damages from Defendants based on Defendants' misinformation \n2 \nabout, and ungrounded maligning of, the good work of SPD's patrol officers, as well as \n3 \nDefendants consistent disregard for clearly established standards regarding use of force and \n4 \nconcomitant disregard for Plaintiffs' livelihood and safety.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive \n5 \n6  damages for City and departmental resources and funds redirected away from the needs of \n7 \npatrol officers and wasted instead on the production of an unreasonable, unconstitutional UF \n8 \nPolicy, well beyond the scope of the original Memorandum of Understanding and placing at \n9 \nunreasonable risk the lives of officers and the public. \n10 \nF. Plaintiffs Seek Attorneys Fees \n11 \n12  Plaintiffs currently represent themselves pro se because of the overwhelming costs related to \n13 \npaying an attorney to represent them in this complex civil rights matter.  We have had the \n14 \nbenefit of a DC-based former civil rights attorney to consult and assist us in researching and \n15 \ndeveloping these pleadings who has, so far, done so without compensation, recognizing the \n16 \nimportance of the issues and the limits on Plaintiffs' ability to pay for representation at this \n17 \n18  time.
