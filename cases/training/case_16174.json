    "summary": "<p>On September 12, 2017, the Sierra Club sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.</p><p>In its complaint, the plaintiff described itself as \"the nation's oldest grassroots environmental organization, [which] . . . has long advocated to protect and preserve the cultures of the borderland communities, as well as the region's land, wildlife, and environment.\" The plaintiff stated that it feared potential environmental damage that could result from President Trump's Executive Order (EO) <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02095.pdf\">No. 13767</a>, authorizing expansion or replacement of portions of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. </p><p>The complaint alleged that the plaintiff had submitted several unfulfilled FOIA requests to defendant agencies, seeking information about the environmental impacts of border wall proposals. First, in 2013, the plaintiff had asked for records since 2010 about border wall construction in a wildlife refuge and flood plains in parts of Texas. Although DHS released a few highly-redacted documents and promised to follow with more information, as of 2017 DHS had not yet completed its search for responsive records and had made no further determination. Next, on March 17, 2017, the plaintiff requested records since 2006 relating to a government consultant's work on the border wall, but the plaintiff had received no further communication from DHS.</p><p>Finally, on May 4, 2017, the plaintiff requested records related to the EO, specifically:<blockquote>1. All records related to the border wall referred to in the Presidential Administration's FY 2017 supplemental appropriations request;</p><p>2. All maps and related documents identifying all locations considered or planned for border fencing/tactical infrastructure described in the FY 2017 appropriations legislation;</p><p>3. All bids by vendors related to border wall proposals and submitted to DHS and/or CBP;</p><p>4. All communications related to border wall proposals between DHS and/or CBP;</p><p>5. All communications between DHS and CBP related to border wall proposals, including, but not limited to: funding, timetables, and vendor </p><p>selection;</p><p>6. All existing and/or proposed timetables for the execution and construction of border wall proposals;</p><p>7. All communications between DHS and/or CBP with the White House </p><p>that relate to border wall proposals;</p><p>8. All communication between DHS and/or CBP and any other federal  agencies that relate to the border wall proposals.</blockquote>DHS then responded to the plaintiff on August 29, 2017, asking it to narrow the scope of its request, and asserting that this request did not constitute a denial.</p><p>The complaint alleged that, in all three of the requests above, DHS violated FOIA by failing to issue a determination within the statutory 20-day deadline and by failing to conduct an adequate records search. Further, regarding the 2013 request, the plaintiff alleged that DHS had violated FOIA by wrongfully withholding non-exempt records. The plaintiff sought a disclosure order under FOIA and attorneys' fees.</p><p>This case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Kandis A. Westmore on September 12. A case management statement was filed on December 5, an ADR conference was held on December 7, and a case management conference on December 12. Plaintiff also filed an amended complaint on December 12. </p><p>The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James for settlement, but the parties on March 26 agreed to a new production schedule. The defendants were set to produce 1000 pages monthly for six months, followed by 750 monthly until completion. On September 6, 2018, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson for settlement.</p><p>The parties engaged in settlement negotiations for several months. Then, on February 1, 2019, the plaintiff requested that the court set a case management schedule to establish a production schedule for documents that the defendants had yet to produce and a briefing schedule to address the defendants' withholdings or redactions. The plaintiff stated that the defendants had not produced any documents since November 18, and the documents that had been produced were heavily redacted. </p><p>On April 18, 2019, the parties filed a joint stipulation requesting that the scheduled settlement conference be continued until June. The parties explained that they had informally agreed to a new production schedule whereby the defendants would increase their production from the previously-agreed 750-1,000 pages per month to 1,200 pages per month. The defendants also agreed to re-evaluate certain redactions that they had claimed under FOIA exemptions and conduct new searches for documents responsive to the plaintiff's FOIA requests. </p><p>The parties requested an additional continuance in June 2019. </p><p>In October 2019 the parties requested a continuance until April 2020. In their update to the court, the parties stated that the defendants had completed productions for the 2013 and 2017 FOIA requests and had begun productions on the 2016 request. The plaintiff again stated that it believed the productions had been heavily redacted and that the parties continued to disagree about the scope and nature of the redactions; however, the parties wished to continue working together informally toward a resolution.</p><p>The documents released by the government are available <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/publication/cbp-border-wall-records-sierra-club-v-us-department-homeland-security-et-al?topic=privacy\">here</a>.</p><p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Sierra Club brings this case under the Freedom of Information Act to \n4  obtain timely disclosure of agency documents regarding the Trump \n5  Administration’s controversial plans to expand or replace the border wall along the \n6 \nUnited States-Mexico border. \n7 \n2.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order, \n8 \nentitled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” directing \n9 \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to vastly expand the existing walls along the \n10 \nroughly 1,900-mile southern border that spans California, Arizona, New Mexico, \n11 \nand Texas. On February 20, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security \n12 \naccordingly directed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to \n13 \n \n14  immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, \nincluding the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as \n15 \npatrol and access roads, along the land border with Mexico in accordance with \n16  existing law, in the most appropriate locations and utilizing appropriate \nmaterials and technology to most effectively achieve operational control of the \n17 \nborder. \n18 \nThe Department further directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to \n19 \n“immediately identify and allocate all sources of available funding” for the \n20 \nplanning, designing, constructing, and maintaining of the border wall. \n21 \n3.  Sierra Club is concerned about and seeks documentation of the \n22 \npotential environmental impacts associated with border wall planning, construction, \n23 \nand operation. For example, the Secretary of Homeland Security invoked a \n24 \nstatutory waiver to exempt border wall construction during the George W. Bush \n25 \nadministration. The act of waiving federal statutes like the Clean Water Act, \n26 \nEndangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act put wildlife and \n27 \n28  Page 2 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 18\n \n1  the public health of local communities at risk. Habitat set aside for endangered \n2  species, including the ocelot, jaguar, and Sonoran pronghorn, has been fragmented \n3  and will be damaged even further by building new wall segments. \n4  4.  The human cost of new walls would also be immense, dividing border \n5 \ncommunities, destroying private land, impeding water flow, harming human health, \n6 \nand causing unnecessary deaths.  \n7 \n5.  The Trump Administration has called for $1.7 billion in development \n8 \nfunds for 60 miles of new border wall construction in fiscal year 2017, and $2.8 \n9 \nbillion in fiscal year 2018. If built, the new walls would bifurcate the Santa Ana \n10 \nNational Wildlife Refuge in the southern tip of Texas, and harm other sensitive \n11 \nareas along the border. The Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat \n12 \nfor a diverse of array of rare wildlife species, including the ocelot, an endangered \n13 \ncat of which there are only about 50 remaining in the United States. Expanded walls \n14 \nand related infrastructure also threatens to undermine the tourist economy of the \n15 \nsurrounding communities. \n16 \n6.  Sierra Club is the nation’s oldest grassroots environmental \n17 \norganization, and has long advocated to protect and preserve the cultures of the \n18 \nborderland communities, as well as the region’s land, wildlife, and environment. As \n19 \npart of this advocacy, and in line with its longstanding interest in government \n20 \naccountability and transparency, the Sierra Club has filed several requests under the \n21 \nFreedom of Information Act with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to obtain \n22 \n23  documents regarding plans to expand or replace the border wall along the U.S.-\n24  Mexico border. The Sierra Club’s Borderlands Grassroots Network Team has been \n25  organizing around border issues for many years, and its advocacy has become more \n26  urgent in light of President Trump’s recent activities. \n27 \n28  Page 3 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 18\n \n1  7.  The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border \n2  Protection (the Agencies) have violated the Freedom of Information Act by failing \n3  to make a “determination,” and failing to produce any documents in response to \n4  Sierra Club’s 2016 and 2017 record requests, and a 2013 Sierra Club request that \n5 \nwas remanded back to the Agencies after Sierra Club successfully appealed the \n6 \nfinal determination. \n7 \n8.  The Agencies have also violated the Freedom of Information Act by \n8 \nfailing to conduct an adequate search for records and wrongfully withholding \n9 \nrecords. \n10 \n9.  Sierra Club brings this lawsuit to hold the Agencies accountable under \n11 \nthe law and respectfully requests that the Court order the Agencies to expeditiously \n12 \nproduce all non-exempt documents responsive to Sierra Club’s records requests. \n13 \n10.  Timely disclosure is imperative. The controversial border wall is a \n14 \nmatter of significant public interest and concern; yet, in secret, the Agencies are \n15 \nactively planning, designing, and preparing for construction and maintenance of the \n16 \nwall. Given the significant threat the wall poses to communities and the \n17 \nenvironment, the public must have timely information about the Trump \n18 \nAdministration’s plans, including the potential impacts on communities, lands, and \n19 \nwildlife.  \n20 \n \n21 \nJURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n22 \n23  11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 \n24  U.S.C. § 1331. \n25  12.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) \n26  because Plaintiff Sierra Club has its principal place of business in Oakland, \n27 \n28  Page 4 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 18\n \n1  California. \n2  13.  For the same reason, intradistrict assignment is proper in the Oakland \n3  Division.  See N.D. Cal. L.R. 3-2. \n4   \n5 \nPARTIES \n6 \n14.  Plaintiff Sierra Club is incorporated in the State of California as a \n7 \nnonprofit public benefit corporation with headquarters in Oakland, California. The \n8 \nSierra Club is a national organization with 67 chapters and more than 825,000 \n9 \nmembers dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the \n10 \nearth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystems and \n11 \nresources; to educating and enlisting humanity to protect and restore the quality of \n12 \nthe natural and human environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these \n13 \nobjectives. Sierra Club is a leading non-governmental organization seeking to \n14 \neducate and mobilize the public on issues of climate change, habitat destruction, \n15 \nand the myriad of human and environmental impacts of the Trump Administration’s \n16 \nproposed Border Wall. Sierra Club’s Borderlands Grassroots Network Team has \n17 \nbeen organizing around border issues for many years. To support the Borderlands \n18 \nTeam’s efforts and to further Sierra Club’s longstanding interest in government \n19 \naccountability and transparency, Sierra Club submitted the records requests at issue \n20 \nin this case. \n21 \n15.  Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its \n22 \n23  members. Sierra Club and its members have been and continue to be injured by the \n24  Agencies’ failure to provide requested records on matters of great public interest \n25  and urgency within the timeframes mandated by the Freedom of Information Act. \n26  Absent this critical information, Sierra Club cannot advance its mission to educate \n27 \n28  Page 5 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 18\n \n1  the public about the proposed expansion of the border wall and its impacts on \n2  communities and the environment. The requested relief will redress this injury. \n3  16.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a department of \n4  the executive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., \n5 \nand an agency of the federal government within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n6 \n§ 552(f)(1). It has in its possession and control the records sought by Sierra Club, \n7 \nand as such, is subject to FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n8 \n17.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is an agency \n9 \nwithin the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and is also headquartered in \n10 \nWashington, D.C. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has possession, custody, \n11 \nand control of the records that Sierra Club seeks. \n12 \n \n13 \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n14 \n18.  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to \n15 \npromptly release to a public requester, documents and records within the possession \n16 \nof the agency, unless a statutory exemption applies. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)–(b). \n17 \n19.  Agencies must make reasonable efforts to search for records in a \n18 \nmanner that is reasonably calculated to locate all records that are responsive to the \n19 \nFOIA request. Id. § 552(a)(3)(C)–(D). \n20 \n20.  The agency must make a determination whether to disclose records \n21 \nwithin twenty business days of an agency’s receipt of a FOIA request. Id. \n22 \n23  § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n24  21.  If an agency determines that it will comply with the request, it must \n25  “promptly” release responsive, non-exempt records to the requester.  Id. \n26  § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). \n27 \n28  Page 6 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 7 of 18\n \n1  22.  The Act recognizes that in certain, limited instances, records may be \n2  withheld as exempt from FOIA’s broad disclosure mandate, and thus the Act \n3  identifies nine categories of exemptions. Id. § 552(b). \n4  23.  FOIA places the burden on the agency to prove that it may withhold \n5 \nresponsive records from a requester. Id. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n6 \n24.  If an agency makes a final determination to withhold or partially \n7 \nwithhold documents, the requester is entitled to appeal the adverse decision to the \n8 \nagency within a period of time “that is not less than 90 days after the date after such \n9 \nadverse determination.” Id. § (a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa). \n10 \n25.  An agency must make a determination on any appeal within twenty \n11 \nbusiness days of receipt. Id. § (a)(6)(A)(ii). \n12 \n26.  If the agency fails to comply with the statutory time limits to respond \n13 \nto a FOIA request or appeal, the requester is deemed to have exhausted her \n14 \nadministrative remedies. Id. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). \n15 \n27.  District courts have jurisdiction to enjoin an agency from withholding \n16 \nagency records and “order the production of any agency records improperly \n17 \nwithheld.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n18 \n28.  The Freedom of Information Act provides a mechanism for \n19 \ndisciplinary action against agency officials who have inappropriately withheld \n20 \nrecords. Specifically, when requiring the release of improperly withheld records, if \n21 \nthe Court makes a written finding that “the circumstances surrounding the \n22 \n23  withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or \n24  capriciously,” a disciplinary investigation is triggered. Id. § 552(a)(4)(F)(i). \n   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  Page 7 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 8 of 18\n \n1  FACTS \n2  Sierra Club’s 2013 FOIA Request for Border Wall Documents and Appeal \n3  29.  On April 10, 2013, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to U.S. \n4  Customs and Border Protection seeking access to the following records: \n \n5 \nThe Sierra Club requests records dating from January 1, 2010 to the present \n6 \npertaining to the construction of border fencing (also commonly referred to \n7  as the border wall, pedestrian fence, and tactical infrastructure) in the vicinity \nof the communities of Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos, Texas. \n8 \nThese sections of border fencing will be built in the Border Patrol’s Rio \n9  Grande Valley sector have been designated O-1, O-2, and O-3. Very little \ninformation has been released to the public regarding these sections of \n10 \nborder fencing, despite a great deal of local public interest. The Sierra Club is \n11 \nparticularly interested in the impact of these fencing sections on the Lower \nRio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the potential for the \n12 \nimpedance of flood waters that may accompany the erection of fencing in the \n13 \nRio Grande flood plain. \n14   \nResponsive documents should include (but not be limited to) internal CBP \n15 \ndiscussions, memos, meeting notes, presentation materials such as \n16  Powerpoints and handouts, and reports regarding fencing sections O-1, O-2, \nand O-3. Any contracts that have been prepared and/or put out for bid and/or \n17 \ngranted for these sections should be included. Documents should also include \n18 \nconsultations, interactions, and discussions with the Army Corps. of \nEngineers, the International Boundary Water Commission, US Fish and \n19 \nWildlife, the State Department, and local government officials and residents \n20 \nregarding these fencing sections. \n21   \nSee Exhibit A. \n22 \n30.  Customs and Border Protection assigned Sierra Club’s request with \n23 \ntracking number CBP-2013-016845. \n24 \n31.  On September 4, 2015, Customs and Border Protection’s FOIA \n25 \nDivision stated that CBP-2013-016845 was currently being processed. \n26 \n32.  After repeated requests for updates by Sierra Club, in January 2016, \n27 \n28  Page 8 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 9 of 18\n \n1  the FOIA request CBP-2013-016845 disappeared from the online queue at \n2  FOIAonline, a federal website dedicated to processing FOIA requests. \n3  33.  On January 29, 2016, a new tracking number appeared in Sierra Club’s \n4  online queue, CBP-2016-018165, corresponding to the same April 10, 2013 FOIA \n5 \nrequest. \n6 \n34.  On December 9, 2016, Customs and Border Protection determined that \n7 \nthe requested documents were partially releasable, and asserted that FOIA \n8 \nexemptions (b)(4) and (b)(5) applied to Sierra Club’s request. \n9 \n35.  Also on December 9, 2016, Customs and Border Protection provided \n10 \nSierra Club with 10 documents, but those documents were redacted almost in their \n11 \nentirety. See Exhibit B. \n12 \n36.  On February 3, 2017, Sierra Club filed a timely administrative appeal \n13 \nto Custom and Border Protection’s determination on CBP-2013-016845/CBP- \n14 \n2016-018165. See Exhibit C. \n15 \n37.  On March 16, 2017, Customs and Border Protection’s Chief of the \n16 \nFOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, replied to Sierra Club’s February 3, \n17 \n2017 appeal of the 2013 FOIA request in part with: \n18 \n \n19  In this case, the FOIA Division released certain redacted documents to you \nbut it does not appear as if the FOIA Division searched for a number of other \n20 \nagency records you identified in your appeal. In this respect, your appeal \n21 \nspecifically identifies various reports, presentations, plans, and other \n22  documents that were requested in your initial FOIA submission. However, as \nit appears as if the FOIA Division did not search for these records, there is \n23 \nan incomplete administrative record for us to review on appeal in this case. \n24   \nAccordingly, we are remanding your request to the FOIA Division for \n25 \nprocessing with instructions that the request should be processed within \n26  twenty (20) days from the date of this letter. . . . As mentioned above, you \nmay immediately challenge the FOIA Division’s failure to respond to your \n27 \n28  Page 9 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 10 of 18\n \nrequest in district court. \n1 \nSee Exhibit D. \n2 \n38.  On April 14, 2017, Customs and Border Protection stated: \n3 \n \n4 \nPlease be advised this case has been remanded to the FOIA Division to \ncomplete additional searches for responsive records. An additional 30 \n5 \nbusiness days from the date of this letter are needed for the program office to \n6 \ncomplete a comprehensive search of records. Once the searches have been \n7  completed, you will receive additional correspondence with a projected time \nframe for the completion of the remand. \n8 \n \n9  See Exhibit E. \n10  39.  As of the date of this filing, the Agencies have not made any further \n11  determination on Sierra Club’s 2013 request or released any additional documents. \n12 \n \n13 \nSierra Club’s 2016 FOIA Requests for Border Wall Documents \n14 \n40.  On November 19, 2016, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to \n15 \nCustoms and Border Protection seeking access to the following: \n16   \nThe Sierra Club trying to understand the scope of work that LMI (the \n17 \nLogistics Management Institute) did for Customs and Border Protection \n18 \nregarding border fencing and related tactical infrastructure. According \nto LMI’s website this work was quite expansive, and LMI and its \n19 \nemployees repeatedly pop up in FOIA documents that we have received \n20 \nfrom CBP and other agencies. LMI employees appear to have played an \n21  important role in the Secure Border Initiative Program Management \nOffice. We have received some SBI PMO meeting minutes from 2007 \n22 \nand 2008 that indicate that meetings were held at LMI's McLean, \n23  Virginia office. \n \n24 \nThe Sierra Club specifically seeks documents, including SBI PMO and \n25 \nother meeting minutes and notes, as well as emails, memos, and reports, \nthat involve and/or relate to the participation of LMI employees in the \n26 \nSecure Border Initiative Program Management Office, and meetings at \n27 \n28  Page 10 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 11 of 18\n \nLMI’s McLean, Virginia office from January 2006 through the present. \n1 \n \n2  Please include emails, letters, call logs, and other communications \nregarding these meetings. Customs and Border Protection discussions, \n3 \nreports, updates, presentation materials such as Powerpoints, etc., that \n4 \npertain to these meetings should be included. \n5 \nSee Exhibit F. \n6 \n41.  Customs and Border Protection assigned the request tracking number \n7 \nCBP-2017-011338. \n8 \n42.  The Agencies have not made any further determination on Sierra \n9 \nClub’s 2016 request, CBP-2017-011338, and have not released any documents. \n10 \n \n11 \nSierra Club’s 2017 FOIA Request for Border Wall Documents \n12 \n43.  On May 4, 2017, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to Customs \n13 \nand Border Protection seeking access to the following: \n14 \n  \n15  1.  All records related to the Border Wall referred to on p. 32 of the \nAdministration’s FY 2017 supplemental appropriations request (see \n16 \nExhibit A), including, but not limited to: \n17  a.  the 14 miles of new Border Wall and 14 miles of replacement \nBorder Wall near San Diego, CA; and \n18 \nb.  the 28 miles of levee-Border Wall in the Rio Grande Valley Sector; \n19 \nand \n20  c.  the 6 miles of new Border Wall proposed in South Texas, \nhereinafter (“Border Wall Proposals”). \n21 \n2.  All maps and related documents that identify all locations considered or \n22  planned for border fencing/tactical infrastructure described in the FY \n2017 Appropriations legislation passed in May 2017 (see Exhibit B, p. \n23 \n69), including but not limited to: \n24  a.  Replacement of primary pedestrian fencing in high priority areas - \n20 miles; and \n25 \nb.  Replacement of vehicle fencing with primary pedestrian fencing in \n26 \nhigh priority areas - 20 miles; and \n27  a.  Gates for existing barriers- 35 gates. \n28  Page 11 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 12 of 18\n \n3.  All bids submitted by vendors to Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) \n1 \nand/or the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) related to the \n2  Border Wall Proposals; and \n4.  All communications between CBP and/or DHS and vendors related to \n3 \nBorder Wall Proposals; and \n4 \n5.

All existing and/or proposed timetables for the execution and construction \n7  of the Border Wall Proposals; and \n7.  All communications between CBP and/or the DHS with the White House \n8 \nthat relate to the Border Wall Proposals; and \n9  8.  All communication between CBP and/or DHS and any other Federal \nAgencies that relate to the Border Wall Proposals. \n10 \nSee Exhibit G. \n11 \n \n12 \n44.  Customs and Border Protection assigned the request tracking number \n13 \nCBP-2017-054695. \n14 \n45.  On August 11, 2017, three months after Sierra Club’s initial request, \n15 \nCustoms and Border Protection sent Sierra Club a letter notifying it that the average \n16 \ntime to process a request related to “travel/border incidents” was a minimum of 3 to \n17 \n6 months. \n18 \n46.  On August 29, 2017, Sierra Club received an email from Customs and \n19 \nBorder Protection with an attached letter, dated August 30, 2017, stating: \n20 \n \n21 \n[W]e have determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not \n22  specifically identify the records which you are seeking. . . .  Whenever \npossible, a request should include specific information about each record \n23 \nsought, such as the event that would have created the record, a date range for \n24  the request, and subject matter of the records. \n \n25 \nThe letter directed Sierra Club to “narrow the scope of your request,” noting that “a \n26 \nsearch for records responsive to your request in it’s [sic] present state could \n27 \n28  Page 12 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 13 of 18\n \n1  potentially return a massive amount of documents which would create an \n2  reasonable [sic] burden on the agency.” The letter went on asking Sierra Club to \n3  “please provide a time frame for items 4 through 8 of your request.” The letter \n4  concluded with “[t]his is not a denial of your request for records.” See Exhibit H. \n5 \n47.  On September 11, Sierra Club sent Customs and Border Protection an \n6 \nemail and letter, explaining that CBP-2017-054695 provides sufficient information \n7 \nfor Customs and Border Protection to perform a limited search with a “reasonable \n8 \namount of effort,” including “the event that would have triggered the record, the \n9 \nsubject matter, scope, and a reasonable date range.” \n10 \n48.  Without acknowledging Sierra Club’s response, Customs and Border \n11 \nProtection closed the May 2017 FOIA request on September 12.  That day, \n12 \nCustoms and Border Protection sent Sierra Club an email, stating:  \n13 \n \n14 \nOn August 30, 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Freedom of \n15  Information Act (FOIA) Division sent you an email via your FOIAonline \naccount asking you to narrow the scope of your request, 2017-054695, and \n16 \nprovide a time frame for records search.  Pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 § 5.3(b) \n17  of the DHS FOIA regulations, you must describe the records you are seeking \nwith as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate \n18 \nsystems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort.  To date \n19 \nwe have not received a response and are unable to continue processing items \n1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of your request.  Pertaining to item number 3 of your \n20 \nrequest:  “All bids submitted by vendors to Customs and Border Protection \n21 \n(“CBP”) and/or the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) related to the \n22  Border Wall Proposals”.  CBP has determined that the records sought are \npart of ongoing government procurements and consist of contractor bid or \n23 \nproposal information or source selection information that CBP is prohibited \n24  from releasing pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. §552 (b)(3), Other Disclosure \nStatutes; specifically 41 U.S.C. § 2102(a)(1), Procurement Integrity Act; and \n25 \n41 U.S.C. § 4702(b), Prohibition on release of contractor proposals, therefore \n26 \nthe records will be withheld in full. \n27 \n28  Page 13 of 18 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 17-5273 KAW    \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22   Filed 12/12/17   Page 14 of 18\n \n1  49.

There is no legal basis for the Agencies to assert that any of the nine \n5 \nexemptions to mandatory disclosure apply to withhold records or portions of \n6 \nrecords from Sierra Club. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1)–(9). \n7 \n76.

Order the Agencies to conduct a search reasonably calculated to \n14 \n15  uncover all records responsive to Sierra Club’s FOIA requests identified in this \n16  complaint; \n17  2.  Order the Agencies to produce, within twenty days or by such a date as \n18  the Court deems appropriate, any and all non-exempt records responsive to Sierra \n19  Club’s FOIA requests, and indexes justifying the withholding of any responsive \n20  records, or portion thereof, withheld under claim of exemption; \n21 \n3.  Enjoin the Agencies from continuing to withhold any and all \n22 \nnonexempt records or portions thereof responsive to Sierra Club’s FOIA requests; \n23 \n4.  Declare that the circumstances surrounding the delay and withholding \n24 \nraise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously; \n25 \n5.

Part 5. \n \nThe Sierra Club requests records dating from January 1, 2010 to the present pertaining to the \nconstruction of border fencing (also commonly referred to as the border wall, pedestrian fence, and tactical \ninfrastructure) in the vicinity of the communities of Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos, Texas.  These \nsections of border fencing will be built in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector have been designated \nO-1, O-2, and O-3.  Very little information has been released to the public regarding these sections of border \nfencing, despite a great deal of local public interest.  The Sierra Club is particularly interested in the impact of \nthese fencing sections on the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the potential for the \nimpedance of flood waters that may accompany the erection of fencing in the Rio Grande flood plain.  \n \nResponsive documents should include (but not be limited to) internal CBP discussions, memos, \nmeeting notes, presentation materials such as Powerpoints and handouts, and reports regarding fencing \nsections O-1, O-2, and O-3.  Any contracts that have been prepared and/or put out for bid and/or granted for \nthese sections should be included.  Documents should also include consultations, interactions, and \ndiscussions with the Army Corps. of Engineers, the International Boundary Water Commission, US Fish and \nWildlife, the State Department, and local government officials and residents regarding these fencing sections.     \n \nPlease search responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.  Where \npossible, please produce records electronically, in PDF or TIF format on a CD-ROM.  We seek records of any \nkind, including electronic records, e-mail, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs.  Our request includes \ntelephone messages, voice mail messages, e-mail, daily agenda and calendars, information about scheduled \nmeetings and/or discussions regarding the aforementioned topics, whether in person or over the telephone, \nagendas for those meetings and/or discussions, participants included in those meetings and/or discussions, \nand transcripts, notes and/or minutes from any such meetings and/or discussions. \n \nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, the Sierra Club \nrequests that you provide it with an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d \n820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1972).  As you are aware, a Vaugn index must describe each \ndocument claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity “to permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the \nmaterial is actually exempt under FOIA.”  Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. \n1979).  Moreover, the Vaugn index must “describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-1   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 6\nwithholding it must discuss the consequences of supplying the sought-after information.”   King v. U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, 830 F. 2d 210, 223-24 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (emphasis added).  Further, “the withholding \nagency must supply ‘a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular \nexemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they \napply.’”  Id. At 224 (citing Mead Data Central v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. \n1977). \n \nIn the event that some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please \ndisclose any reasonable segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C § 552(b).  If it \nis your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so \ndispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the \ndocument is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document.  Mead Data Central, \n566 F.2d at 261.  Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for \nclaims of exemptions in a Vaugn index.  If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not \nreasonable to segregate portions of the record for release. \n \n \nRequest for Expedition \n \nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(a)(6)(E)(i) and DHS regulations, 6 CFR §5.5(d), the Sierra Club requests \nthat Customs and Border Protection expedite the processing of this request in light of the compelling need for \nthe requested information.  There exists an urgent need to inform the public about federal government activity \nin regards to potential or realized impacts of “tactical infrastructure” along the U.S. – Mexico border (also \ncommonly referred to as the border fence, border wall, pedestrian fence, and vehicle barriers) upon the water \nand hydrology of adjacent areas.  “Tactical infrastructure” constructed along the U.S.-Mexico in recent years \nhas been cited as a cause of flooding in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Nogales, Sonora, \nMexico; threatens the Tijuana River and estuary with sedimentation as a result of erosion; and may impact the \nRio Grande, which is the primary source of drinking water for millions of residents on both sides of the border.  \nA fuller understanding of the potential and/or realized impacts of “tactical infrastructure” will allow communities \nand land managers to better anticipate and mitigate likely impacts. \n \nFurther, the Sierra Club is primarily engaged in working to protect communities, wild places, and the \nnatural environment.  The Sierra Club is a non-profit corporation, organized under section 501(c)(4) of the \nInternal Revenue code.  The release of information garnered through this request is not in the Sierra Club’s \nfinancial interest.  The Sierra Club will analyze the information responsive to this request, and will likely share \nits analysis with the public, either through memoranda, reports, or press releases.  The Sierra Club has an \nestablished record of carrying out these types of activities.  The Sierra Club also plans to disseminate any \ndocuments that it acquires from its request to the public through www.governmentdocs.org, an interactive \nwebsite that includes thousands of pages of public documents obtained by a number of organizations.    \n \nAs with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the ACLU, two organizations that the courts have \nfound satisfy the criteria necessary to qualify for expedition, the Sierra Club “gathers information of potential \ninterest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw material into a distinct work, and \ndistributes that work to an audience.”  ACLU, 321 F. Supp.2d at 30 n.5 (quotation omitted). \n \nPursuant to 6 CFR §5.5(d)(3), I hereby certify that the bases for the Sierra Club’s request for \nexpedition, as set forth herein, are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Accordingly, the \nSierra Club requests that Customs and Border Protection expedite its processing of this FOIA request. \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-1   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 6\nFee Waiver Request \n \nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. Part 5, the Sierra Club requests a waiver of \nfees associated with processing this request for records.  The waiver is in the public interest because \nfurnishing this information primarily benefits the general public.  The subject of this request concerns the \noperations of the federal government and expenditures, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better \nunderstanding of relevant government procedures by the Sierra Club and the general public in a significant \nway.  Moreover, the request is primarily and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes.  5 U.S.C. \n§552(a)(4)(A)(iii).  See, e.g., McClellan Ecological v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1285 (9th Cir. 1987). \n \nCustoms and Border Protection has granted the Sierra Club fee waivers for prior FOIA requests.  In a \nletter dated April 13, 2012 Customs and Border Protection’s FOIA Appeals, Policy & Litigation Branch affirmed \nthe Sierra Club’s contention that our non-profit organization that will derive no commercial gain from requested \nFOIA documents, and will instead disseminate them to the public free of charge.  We were therefore granted \nour fee waiver request.  Other federal agencies have also granted the Sierra Club’s fee waiver request for \ndocuments related to border fencing. \n \nThe records requested by the Sierra Club are likely to contribute to the public’s understanding of the \npotential or realized impacts of border fencing upon ecosystems and human communities along the Rio \nGrande, to shed light upon the decision to move forward with these fencing sections, and provide the public \nwith updated information as to where this process currently stands.  This policy issue has been the subject of \nfrequent press inquiry and public debate. \n \nThe Sierra Club, along with its members, has published articles, reports, fact sheets, and other \neducational materials based on information that we have gained from documents received from a number of \nfederal agencies via the Freedom of Information Act.  None of these resulted in any sort of financial profit for \nthe Sierra Club.  In regards to Customs and Border Protection and border fencing, in addition to other types of \neducational materials we have had a number of articles published in the Rio Grande Guardian, the Monitor, the \nTexas Observer, the Associated Press, and other news outlets based on documents provided to us through \nprevious Freedom of Information Act requests.  These articles were written for the sole purpose of educating \nthe public, including readers of the Rio Grande Guardian who live in the border communities that will be \ndirectly impacted by the proposed border fencing.  No payment of any kind was made to the Sierra Club for \nthese articles, or for any of the other articles that have been written based on these documents.  Many of the \ndocuments that have been received, and all of those that are quoted in the articles, have been posted at \nwww.scribd.com, where they can be viewed and/or downloaded by the public free of charge.  Copies of all of \nthe documents regarding border fencing that the Sierra Club has received have been lodged at the University \nof Texas Pan American’s Border Studies Archive, where they are available to researchers and the public.  At \nno point was the Sierra Club assessed fees by Customs and Border Protection, the Department of the Interior, \nUS International Boundary Water Commission, or other federal agencies for FOIA requests pertaining to \nborder fencing. \n \nIn considering fee waiver criteria, please note that the FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure, and \nthat the fee waiver amendments of 1986 were specifically designed to afford groups such as the Sierra Club \naccess to government documents without the payment of fees.  As stated by the Chairman of the U.S. Senate \nJudicial Committee, “[A]gencies should not be allowed to use fees as an offensive weapon against requesters \nseeking access to Government information . . .”  132 Cong. Rec. S. 14298 (statement of Sen. Leahy).  The \nNinth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the amended statute “is to be liberally construed in favor of \nwaivers for noncommercial requesters.”  McClellan Ecological Seepage Situation v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, \n1284 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing Sen. Leahy).  The Ninth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeals maintain that \nthe amendment's main purpose is “to remove the roadblocks and technicalities which have been used by \nvarious Federal agencies to deny waivers or reductions of fees under the FOIA.”  Id.; also see Judicial Watch, \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-1   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 6\n326 F.3d at 1315.  Therefore, Congress and the courts unequivocally hold that the main legislative purpose of \nthe amendments is to facilitate access to agency records by noncommercial requesters and “watchdog” public \ninterest organizations, such as the Sierra Club, that use information obtained under FOIA to monitor, and at \ntimes challenge, government activities, and to inform the general public about said activities. As the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals stated, the fee waiver provision was added to the FOIA “in an attempt to prevent \ngovernment agencies from using high fees to discourage certain types of requesters and requests,” with \nexplicit reference to requests from journalists, scholars and non-profit public interest groups.  Better \nGovernment Association v. Department of State, 780 F.2d 86, 93-94 (D.C. Cir. 1986), quoting Ettlinger v. \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, 596 F. Supp. 867, 876 (D. Mass. 1984). \n \nUnder these circumstances, the Sierra Club fully satisfied the criteria for a fee waiver. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nPlease respond to this request in writing within an expedited time-frame.  If all of the requested \ndocuments are not available within that time period, the Sierra Club request that you provide all requested \nrecords or portions of records that are available within that time period. \n \nIf you have any questions about this request or foresee any problems in releasing fully the requested \nrecords within the twenty-day period, please contact me at (956) 532-5983.  Also, if the Sierra Club’s request \nfor a fee waiver is not granted in full, please contact me immediately upon making such a determination.   \n \nPlease send requested documents to: \n \nScott Nicol \nChair, Sierra Club Borderlands Team \n  7300 N. 32nd \nMcAllen, TX  78504 \n \n \nThank you, \n      \n \nScott Nicol \nSierra Club Borderlands Team Chair \nwww.sierraclub.org/borderlands  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-1   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 6\n \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 1 of 46\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 2 of 46\nAcquisition Strategy and Timeline \n  (b) (5), (b) (4)  \n  (b) (5), (b) (4)  \n \nCourse of Action: \n \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n•   \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n•   \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n•   \n \nSegment  O-1  O-2  O-3 \nBase Plan: \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n       \n \n   \n \n       \n       \n       \n       \n1 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 46\nBudget \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\nTotal:    \n \nPrimary Drivers: \n \n(b) (4), \n• Construction:    \n(b) (5)\n(b) (4), \n• Real Estate:    \n(b) (5)\n(b) (4), \n• Contingency:    \n(b) (5)\n• Program, Project and Construction \n(b) (4), \n     Management:    \n(b) (5)\n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 46\n“Pivot” Plan \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n \n   \nConsistent, Scalable Approach: \n \nPast Success on Similar Programs \n• Real Estate & Environmental:   \n(b) (4), \n(b) (4), (b) (5)  \n• Acquisition:    (b) (5)\n \n   \n \n(b) (4), (b) \n   \n(5)\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n• Risk:      \n   \n• Budget:  (b) (4), (b) (5) (b) (4), (b) (5)  \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n \n             \n(b) (4), (b) (5)  \n• Staffing:    \n                                                         \n(b) (4), (b) (5)    \n                 \n \n                               \n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n   \n                 \n \n \n \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 46\nActivity ID Activity Name Remaining Start Finish\nDuration\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n (b) (4), (b) (5)\n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 46\nActivity ID Activity Name Remaining Start Finish\nDuration\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n  (b) (4), (b) (5)\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n2(b) (4), (b) (5)\n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 7 of 46\nActivity ID Activity Name Remaining Start Finish\nDuration\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n(b) \n(4), \n(b) \n(5)\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 8 of 46\nActivity ID Activity Name Remaining Start Finish\nDuration\n(b) (4), (b) (5)\n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-2   Filed 12/12/17   Page 9 of 46\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY \nBUREAU OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION \nTACTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (TI) PROJECT  \n \n \nReview Comments Matrix \nComments are due by 10:00 AM (CDT) Friday, April 12, 2013 \n \nPROJECT:  O-1, 2, 3  DATE:  April 11, 2013 \nPROJECT MILESTONE:  Draft Schedule \nRESPONSE LEGEND: \nA - Concur  D - Do Not Concur  E - Exception  X - Delete Comment  \n(All responses besides “Concur” require a brief explanation from the Designer.) \nCOMMENT  RESPONSE BY \nREVIEWER  REVIEW COMMENT \nNO.

This FOIA request has repeatedly changed tracking numbers, beginning with CBP-2013-016845 when \nit was submitted on April 17, 2013, and ending with tracking number CBP-2016-018165 when the Sierra Club was \nprovided with just 10 completely redacted documents on December 9, 2016 and no Vaughn index as required by Vaughn \nv. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), and as requested by the Sierra Club in our original 2013 FOIA request.   \n \nThe Sierra Club requested the following on April 17, 2013: \n \nThe Sierra Club requests records dating from January 1, 2010 to the present pertaining to the construction of \nborder fencing (also commonly referred to as the border wall, pedestrian fence, and tactical infrastructure) in \nthe vicinity of the communities of Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos, Texas.  These sections of border \nfencing will be built in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector have been designated O-1, O-2, and O-3.  \nVery little information has been released to the public regarding these sections of border fencing, despite a \ngreat deal of local public interest.  The Sierra Club is particularly interested in the impact of these fencing \nsections on the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the potential for the impedance of flood \nwaters that may accompany the erection of fencing in the Rio Grande flood plain.  \n \nResponsive documents should include (but not be limited to) internal CBP discussions, memos, meeting notes, \npresentation materials such as Powerpoints and handouts, and reports regarding fencing sections O-1, O-2, and \nO-3.  Any contracts that have been prepared and/or put out for bid and/or granted for these sections should be \nincluded.  Documents should also include consultations, interactions, and discussions with the Army Corps. of \nEngineers, the International Boundary Water Commission, US Fish and Wildlife, the State Department, and local \ngovernment officials and residents regarding these fencing sections.     \n \nPlease search responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.  Where possible, \nplease produce records electronically, in PDF or TIF format on a CD-ROM.  We seek records of any kind, including \nelectronic records, e-mail, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs.  Our request includes telephone messages, \nvoice mail messages, e-mail, daily agenda and calendars, information about scheduled meetings and/or \ndiscussions regarding the aforementioned topics, whether in person or over the telephone, agendas for those \nmeetings and/or discussions, participants included in those meetings and/or discussions, and transcripts, notes \nand/or minutes from any such meetings and/or discussions. \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 13\nIt is the Sierra Club’s assertion that Customs and Border Protection’s response to our FOIA request fails to meet the \nrequirements of the Freedom of Information Act in a number of ways: \n \n1)  Customs and Border Protection took far longer to provide responsive documents than FOIA allows.  Three years \nand eight months elapsed before the Sierra Club received any documents.  During most of that time the Sierra \nClub’s repeated requests for updates or a timeline for the delivery of responsive documents went unanswered.  \nIt was not until 2016, three years after the initial submission of our FOIA, that we began to have what we hoped \nwould be productive discussions with CBP staff. \n2)  In January of 2016 the long-ignored FOIA request mysteriously dropped from the Sierra Club’s online queue in \nthe Customs and Border Protection FOIA system.  When the Sierra Club contacted CBP regarding the lost FOIA it \nwas reinstated, but rather than retain the 2013 tracking number it was assigned a 2016 tracking number, which \nwould give the false appearance that our FOIA was three years younger than it actually is.  As CBP employs a \n“first come first served” policy, this likely moved our request to the back of CBP’s backlog. \n3)  Ultimately the documents provided were so heavily redacted as to be completely useless.  All information was \nblacked out.  While multi-year delays violate the letter of the Freedom of Information Act, providing allegedly \nresponsive documents with every iota of information redacted clearly runs counter to the basis of the law.   \n4)  The Sierra Club received just 10 documents in response to our request, despite the fact that our FOIA covered a \nbroad range of documents and document types over multiple years.  The Sierra Club has been submitting FOIA \nrequests to a number of federal agencies over the past few years, including Customs and Border Protection, and \nhas received many documents that would have been responsive to this FOIA, or that indicate the existence of far \nmore documents that would have been responsive.  Customs and Border Protection excluded many, many \ndocuments without providing a Vaughn index indicating what documents were withheld and the statutory \nreason for withholding them. \n \nThe Sierra Club therefore appeals Customs and Border Protection’s inadequate response to our 2013 – 2016 Freedom of \nInformation Act request.  Customs and Border Protection should immediately initiate a new, thorough search for \nresponsive documents.  These should be provided in a timely manner, and any redactions should be minimal and \nexplained with sufficient detail to make their reasoning clear.   \n \n1 & 2)   In regards to points one and two above, the Sierra Club provides a timeline of communications regarding our \nFOIA request, initially assigned tracking number CBP-2013-016845 in April 2013, and closed out with tracking number \nCBP-2016-018165 in December 2016.  Both the duration and details of the Club’s interactions with CBP on this FOIA \ndemonstrate that CBP has failed to comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. \n \nTimeline of communications with CBP re: the Sierra Club’s FOIA request: \n \n  Submitted FOIA on April 17, 2013.  CBP assigned it tracking number CBP-2013-016845. \n  September 4, 2013 it was merged with FOIA request CBP-2013-010601. \n  Repeated email requests for status update unanswered. \n  July 4, 2014 submitted an inquiry to CBP requesting an update. \n  August 14, 2014 received an email response from PIO Munoz which suggested looking at the \nonline queue for updates.  No information provided in either this email or the queue.  This was tagged \nIncident: 140704-000035. \n  August 22, 2014 sent an email to CBP:   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 13\n“There has still been no response regarding the status of the Sierra Club's FOIA request, tracking # CBP-\n2013-010601.  This FOIA is well over a year old, having been submitted on 4/17/2013.  Please provide us \nwith a status update and when we should expect to begin receiving responsive documents immediately, \nas such a long delay with no explanation whatsoever is in no way keeping with the requirements of the \nFreedom of Information Act.” \n  August 22, 2014 received email response from CBP:  “An account was automatically created for you but you \ncan't login until your password has been set.” \n  August 22, 2014 replied to CBP email:  \n“We already have an account.  It would not matter anyway, since the email that you sent stated that \nonly FOIA requests created after October 2013 can be checked online, and ours was submitted in April \nof 2013.

Again, the request # is \nCBP-2013-010601.” \n  August 24, 2014 received email from PIO Lerma:   \n“Thank you for contacting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) INFO Center. \nPlease contact FOIA directly 202-325-0150” \n  August 25, 2014 called CBP on the phone – received no information (details of the call described \nbelow). \n  August 25, 2014 responded to CBP’s August 24 email:   \n“This was not helpful, as the person who answered at 202-325-0150 stated that she could not give me \nan update on the status of the Sierra Club's FOIA request CBP-2013-010601 which was submitted in April \nof 2013.  She said that she could only look at the same online screen that I already have access to, and \nwhich has not changed for more than a year.  To pass my request on to a supervisor she needed to find \na pencil and paper to write a note.   \nEssentially you have created a feedback loop that reinforces, rather than fixes, the problem of \nascertaining when CBP intends to provide documents that are responsive to the Sierra Club's FOIA \nrequest.  Online you say call this number, but when the number is called I am told to check online.  At \nmore than a year old and with no substantive response this is a clear violation of the Freedom of \nInformation Act.  \nPlease provide a timeline for providing responsive documents immediately.” \n  July 1, 2015 received an email re: fee waiver request:   \n“Your request for Fee Waiver for the FOIA request CBP-2013-016845 has been determined to be not \napplicable as the request is not billable.” \n  July 7, 2015 responded to CBP email requesting clarification. \n  January 2016 the FOIA request disappeared from the Sierra Club’s online queue  \n  January 21, 2016 email sent to CBP protesting the “lost” FOIA.  Included a copy of the FOIA \n request. \n  January 22, 2016 sent a second emai to CBP regarding the “lost” FOIA request. \n  January 29, 2016 “new” FOIA appears in Sierra Club’s queue, assigned tracking number  \nCBP-2016-018165. \n  January 29, 2016 called CBP FOIA officer at (202) 344-1610 and left a message regarding our  \n  concern that this maneuver would restart the clock on a nearly 3 year old FOIA request. \n  February 2, 2016 received an email stating that the tracking number had changed to  \nCBP-OBP-2016-018165.  This email and subsequent emails also showed the “date \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 13\nsubmitted” as January 29, 2016. \n  February 3, 2016 received an email stating that CBP-OBP-2016-018165 would change to  \nCBP-2016-018165 \n  February 4, 2016 received an email stating that CBP-2016-018165 would change to  \nCBP-OA-2016-018165. \n  April 15, 2016 spoke on the phone with CBP (Grace Peterson, et. al.), who said that they were \nworking on the FOIA. \n  April 18, 2016 sent follow up email to Grace Peterson, et. al., regarding the April 15 phone call.  \nFocused primarily on a different FOIA, but this one was mentioned as well. \n  June 9, 2016 email from Grace Peterson suggesting a phone call re: this FOIA request and another pending FOIA. \n  Multiple emails regarding a separate FOIA request that was pending release.  \n  October 2, 2016 sent an email to Grace Peterson, Paul Enriquez, and Ashley Tackett:   \n“Could you please provide a status update on the Sierra Club Borderlands Team's other FOIA requests, \nCBP- \n2015-045142 and CBP-2016-018165 (which was originally submitted in 2013 and given the tracking \nnumber CBP-2013-016845).” \n  October 6, 2016 email from Grace Peterson with Paul Enriquez, and Ashley Tackett cc’d  \n  suggesting a call to discuss the long-pending FOIA requests. \n  October 10, 2016 phone call scheduled for October 11. \n  October 11, 2016 two more emails to establish the time for the call. \n  October 11, 2016 phone call to discuss the progress on the Sierra Club’s outstanding FOIA  \n  requests. \n  November 11, 2016 sent email to Grace Peterson, Paul Enriquez, and Ashley Tackett:   \n“Could you please provide a status update on the Sierra Club Borderlands Team's other FOIA requests, \nCBP-2015-045142 and CBP-2016-018165 (which was originally submitted in 2013 and given the tracking \nnumber CBP-2013-016845).” \n  November 22, 2016 received email from Grace Peterson with Paul Enriquez, and Stacy Howell  \n  cc’d:  \n“My sincerest apologies for missing the following email. To provide a brief update, CBP-2016-018165 \nshould be wrapped up shortly. I sent up a partial release to our FOIA office a few months back, did you \nreceive those documents?” \n  November 22, 2016 sent email to Grace Peterson, Paul Enriquez, and Stacy Howell:   \n“I have not received any documents for either request.” \n  November 23, 2016 received email from Grace Peterson with Paul Enriquez, and Stacy Howell \n cc’d:  \n“Okay thank you for letting me know, Scott. Let me check back with our FOIA office to see what the \nsituation is there.” \n  December 8, 2016 sent email to Grace Peterson, Paul Enriquez, and Stacy Howell:   \n“Have you found anything out regarding the Sierra Club's pending FOIA requests?  Any idea when we \nwill receive responsive documents?” \n  December 9, 2016 received a form email:  \n“A search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \nrequest CBP-2016-018165, requesting records dating from January 1, 2010 to the present pertaining to \nthe construction of border fencing (also commonly referred to as the border wall, pedestrian fence, and \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 13\ntactical infrastructure) in the vicinity of the communities of Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos, \nTexas. \nCBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nand have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \n                                                                                       Section 552 (FOIA)                                                                               \n___ (b)(1) ___ (b)(2)       ___ (b)(3)       _X__ (b)(4)       _X__ (b)(5)       ___ (b)(6) \n___ (b)(7)(A) ___ (b)(7)(B) ___ (b)(7)(C) ___ (b)(7)(D)  ___ (b)(7)(E)  ___ (b)(7)(F)   \n___  (b)(3) Statute 49 U.S.C. § 114(s) \n  December 10, 2016 sent email to Grace Peterson, Paul Enriquez, and Stacy Howell: \n“Hi Grace, \nI just received the final disposition for the Sierra Club's FOIA request regarding border fence sections O-\n1, O-2, and O-3.  As you will recall, this request was initially submitted in 2013 and assigned tracking \nnumber CBP-2013-016845.  It was lost by CBP and then reinstated as CBP-2016-018165.   \nDid you have a look at the documents that were provided?  It would not take long.  Even though the \nrequest covered a date range of 2010 through the present, only 10 very short documents were \nprovided.  There are a number of CBP documents that would have been responsive to this FOIA that \nwere provided to the Sierra Club by the US IBWC and the Army Corps of Engineers in prior FOIA requests \nthat were left out, so the reason for the brevity of CBP's response, despite the years spent on it, is hard \nto fathom. \nMoreover, the documents that were provided were entirely redacted.  There is literally no information \nvisible on them.  I am attaching the first two of the 10 documents, not because they are the worst of the \nvery small lot, but because they are all likewise redacted. \nThere is no way that this could be considered to be compliant with the Freedom of Information Act, as \nno information whatsoever was provided.   \nIt is difficult to see what it is that Customs and Border Protection feels that it is necessary to hide.  One \ndocument, based on the fact that its file name has \"CIR\" in it, appears to be a planning document for the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform bill that came out a few years ago.  That legislation was never \nsigned into law, so I cannot imagine what information could be in that document that should be \nshielded from public view.  It was contingency planning for something that did not occur.  In other cases, \nsuch as the multi-colored spreadsheet that I have attached, there is no indication at all as to what it \nmight relate to.   \nI would appreciate it if we could discuss this next week.  Please let me know when you are available.” \n  December 19, 2016.  Received email and letter from Patrick Howard, which read in part:  \n“CBP FOIA has been made aware that you reached out to another office with concerns about the \nresponse you received.  Please be advised that this is not the correct format for filing an appeal.” \n  December 20, 2016.  Responded to Mr. Howard:   \n“I reached out to Grace Peterson regarding the inadequacy of the documents released in response to \nthe Sierra Club's three year old FOIA because Grace and I had repeatedly discussed this FOIA request \nover the past year via phone and email.  My hope was that she would see the withholding of relevant \nand releasable documents and excessive redactions and would act to rectify the situation without the \nneed to file an appeal.  I am disappointed to find that this could not be so easily resolved.” \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 7 of 13\n3)  In regards to point three, the Sierra Club asserts that redactions have been used far beyond the degree that is \nallowed under the Freedom of Information Act, to the extent that the documents that were provided in response to our \nFOIA request provide us with no actual information.   \n \nThe FOIA response cites exemptions B(4) and B(5) extensively. Below is our analysis of the inappropriate use of these \nexemptions. \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), known as Exemption B(4), to be applied to documents which would reveal \"[t]rade secrets and \ncommercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\"  \nExemption 4 protects from public disclosure just two types of information: (1) trade secrets; and (2) information that is \n(a) commercial or financial, and (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential. All three parts of the \ncommercial or financial exemption must be met. Congress intended this exemption to protect the interests of both the \ngovernment and submitters of information. Its existence encourages submitters to voluntarily furnish useful commercial \nor financial information to the government and it correspondingly provides the government with an assurance that such \ninformation will be reliable. It is unclear whether the B(4) exemption was applied because of the “trade secrets” \nprovision at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4)(1), or the commercial or financial provision at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4)(2), because no \nVaughn index was provided. For many documents provided, it is impossible, due to the level of redaction, to infer from \ncontext what information has been redacted.  \nTrade Secrets, Exemption B(4)(1) \nA trade secret is a commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device. This is a narrow and relatively easily \nrecognized category of information. It is \"a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used \nfor the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product \nof either innovation or substantial effort.\" Public Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1288 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). An example of a trade secret might be the formula of a gasoline additive.  \nAs an example of the inappropriate use of exemption B(4)(1), which may have been used to redact the responsive \ndocument “BH Schedule Comment Form 11 APR 13 a Redacted,” you can see from the context of the document that the \nmaterial redacted is a comment by someone at DHS/CBP and is therefore not a trade secret. Similarly, for responsive \ndocument 143875 PF225 WBS View(2) Redacted” the use of exemption B(4)(1) appears to have been used to redact \nactivity descriptions or names and the duration of the activity, neither of which are trade secrets. In other documents \nredactions under the B(4) exemption include dates, costs, staffing level information, and cost estimates. None of these \nredactions falls within the scope of the B(4)(1) exemption for “trade secrets.” \nCommercial or Financial Information Obtained from a Person and Privileged or Confidential, Exemption B(4)(2) \nThe second form of protected data is \"commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or \nconfidential.\" Courts have held that data qualifies for withholding if disclosure by the government would be likely to \nharm the competitive position of the person who submitted the information. Detailed information on a company's \nmarketing plans, profits, or costs can qualify as confidential business information. Information may also be withheld if \ndisclosure would be likely to impair the government's ability to obtain similar information in the future.  \nGenerally, the commercial/financial nature of a document is not difficult to ascertain, consequently, the main issue in \ncontest is whether the information is privileged or confidential. However, for the responsive documents received, it is \nimpossible to determine if any of the redacted information is commercial or financial and in fact, most of the redactions \nappear from the context of the documents to not fall within this exemption. For example (and again citing the same two \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 8 of 13\ndocuments), in responsive document “BH Schedule Comment Form 11 APR 13 a Redacted,” you can see from the \ncontext of the document that the material redacted is a comment by someone at DHS/CBP and is therefore not \ncommercial or financial information, nor provided by someone outside the agency. Similarly, for responsive document \n143875 PF225 WBS View(2) Redacted” the use of exemption B(4)(2) appears to have been used to redact activity \ndescriptions or names and the duration of the activity, neither of which are commercial or financial information. And \nagain, in other documents redactions under the B(4) exemption include dates, costs, staffing level information, and cost \nestimates. None of these redactions falls within the scope of the B(4)(2) exemption for commercial or financial \ninformation. Not only do these redactions fail to meet all three parts of the test for the use of exemption B(4)(2), they \nfail to meet any part of that test.  \n \nA leading case on this aspect of Exemption 4 sets out the test for exempting commercial information from FOIA \ndisclosure as follows:  \n\"Commercial or financial matter is \"confidential\" for purposes of [Exemption 4] if disclosure of the information is \nlikely to have either of the following effects: (1) to impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary \ninformation in the future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom \nthe information was obtained.\" National Parks and Conservation Ass'n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C.Cir. \n1974); see also Frasee v. U.S. Forest Service, 97 F.3d 367, 371 (9th Cir. 1996). \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), Documents which are \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letters\" which would be \nprivileged in civil litigation.  \nExemption 5 is an exemption very frequently invoked against public interest requesters because the nature of such \nparty's intended uses are usually to get information regarding the agency's processes and conclusions. Notably, the \nexemption was intended to incorporate common-law privileges against discovery. Of all such privileges, the one most \nfrequently encountered by public interest requesters is based on the concept of \"executive\" privilege which protects \nrecommendations and advice which are part of the \"deliberative process\" involved in governmental decision-making. \nThe rationale being to protect the integrity of agency decision-making by encouraging both full and frank discussions of \npolicy proposals and to prevent premature disclosure of policies under review.  \nThe exemption also incorporates other of privileges which would apply in litigation involving the government. For \nexample, papers prepared by the government's lawyers can be withheld in the same way that papers prepared by \nprivate lawyers for clients are not available through discovery in civil litigation. However, this incorporation of discovery \nprivileges requires that a privilege be applied in the FOIA context as it exists in the discovery context. See United States \nDep't of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 13 (1988) (holding that presentence report privilege, designed to protect report \nsubjects, cannot be invoked against them as first-party requesters). Thus, the precise contours of a privilege, with regard \nto applicable parties or types of information which are protectable, are also incorporated into the FOIA. Id.  \nCourts have resolved to distinguish \"pre-decisional\" documents, which fall within the protections of Exemption 5, and \n\"post-decisional\" documents, which must be disclosed. F.T.C. v. Warner Comm. Inc., 742 F2d 1156, 1161 (9th. Cir. 1984); \nNLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151-153 (1975) (memos directing agency counsel criteria and actions \ninvolved in decision to file complaints are not final dispositions of issue, and are thus protected, while final opinions or \ndispositions can never be protected by Exemption 5).  \nHowever, even if a document is pre-decisional, some courts have upheld a distinction between \"materials reflecting \ndeliberative or policy-making process on the one hand, and purely factual, investigative matters on the other,\" the \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 9 of 13\nexemption protects the former, not the latter. EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 89 (1973). Those portions of a document which \nare not exempt must be disclosed unless they are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the exempt portions. Ryan v. Dept. of \nJustice, 617 F. 2d 781, 790-91 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  \nIn the response to the FOIA request at issue in this appeal, exemption 5 was used in multiple times to redact what \nappears to be factual information such as dates, times, budget information, start and finish dates, activity names, \nactivity ID numbers, staffing levels, definitions, next steps, options, environmental requirements, assumptions used in \nanalysis, and requirements for projects. Very clearly, exemption 5 does not apply to these items and the extremely \noverbroad use of this exemption to redact nearly every word from the responsive documents is inappropriate as none of \nthis information would be privileged or confidential in civil litigation.  \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6), Documents which are \"personnel and medical and similar files the disclosure of which would \nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"  \nThis exemption protects the privacy interests of individuals by allowing an agency to withhold personal data kept in \ngovernment files. The Supreme Court has reviewed the application of this exemption.  \nFirst, in evaluating whether a request for information lies within the scope of a FOIA exemption, such as Exemption 6, \nthat bars disclosure when it would amount to an invasion of privacy that is to some degree 'unwarranted, 'a court must \nbalance the public interest in disclosure against the interest Congress intended the [e]xemption to protect.\" Department \nof Defense v. F.L.R.A., 114 S.Ct. 1006, 1012 (1994). Second, the only relevant \"public interest in disclosure\" to be \nweighed in this balance is the extent to which disclosure would serve the \"core purpose of the FOIA,\" which is \n\"contribut[ing] significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Id.  \nIn other words, the requested materials must in some way illuminate \"what the government is 'up to'\" in order to justify \ndisclosure. While a request for information from the government which illustrates what your neighbor or business \ncompetitor is \"up to\" will not meet the public interest balancing test under exemption 6. The exemption requires \nagencies to strike a balance between an individual's privacy interest and the public's right to know. However, since only \na clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy is a basis for withholding, there is a perceptible tilt in favor of disclosure in the \nexemption. \"In the Act generally, and particularly under Exemption (6), there is a strong presumption in favor of \ndisclosure.\" Local 598 v. Department of Army Corps of Engineers, 841 F.2d 1459, 1463 (9th. Cir. 1988) (emphasis added). \nIn that case, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the context of applicable Exemption 6 case law:  \nIn the documents produced as a response to the FOIA request at issue in this appeal exemption 6 has been used to \nredact the name of a person who commented on a DHS form. There is no way for the public to know if this person is an \nemployee of DHS or a contractor hired by DHS. There is no invasion of privacy in releasing just the name of the person \nwho filled out a government for while working in some capacity for the government, but there is a public interest in \nunderstanding whether DHS is using its own staff or outside contractors to fill out this form.  \nUnfortunately, DHS has a habit of redacting every individual’s name on every document released via FOIA, even when \nthe name of the person is a publicly elected official and the document was produced in their official capacity. This is not \nan appropriate use of exemption 6 because no substantial privacy interest has been (or can be) identified and the public \ninterest outweighs the (here, non-existent) privacy concern.  \nThis habit of mechanical, thoughtless redactions flies in the face of FOIA. The Freedom of Information Act embodies a \nstrong policy of disclosure and places a duty to disclose on federal agencies. As the district court recognized, 'disclosure, \nnot secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.' Department of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361, 96 S.Ct. 1592, \n1599, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). 'As a final and overriding guideline courts should always keep in mind the basic policy of the \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 10 of 13\nFOIA to encourage the maximum feasible public access to government information....' Nationwide Bldg. Maintenance, \nInc. v. Sampson, 559 F.2d 704, 715 (D.C.Cir.1977). As a consequence, the listed exemptions to the normal disclosure rule \nare to be construed narrowly. See Rose, 425 U.S. at 361, 96 S.Ct. at 1599. This is particularly true of Exemption (6). \nExemption (6) protects only against disclosure which amounts to a 'clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' \nThat strong language 'instructs us to 'tilt the balance [of disclosure interests against privacy interests] in favor of \ndisclosure.'\"  Id. (emphasis added), citing Washington Post Co. v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, \n261 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting Ditlow v. Shultz, 517 F.2d 166, 169 (D.C. Cir.1975)).  \n \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E), Documents which include “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” \nand which would compromise law enforcement investigations or prosecutions.  \nExemption 7(E) covers “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” that “would disclose techniques \nand procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement \ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)(7)(E). This exemption was used for document “Brief CIR Draft 1 7 Redacted,” which is apparently a presentation \nabout Comprehensive Immigration Reform where the “Notional CIR Requirements” are redacted. It is impossible to \ndetermine whether this is an appropriate use of exemption 7(E) because no Vaughn index was provided and no rationale \nfor the redaction was provided.  \nThe “requirement that disclosure risk circumvention of the law ‘sets a relatively low bar for the agency to justify \nwithholding.’”  See Pub. Employees for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water Comm’n, U.S.-\nMexico, 740 F.3d 195, 204–05 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  The agency \n“must demonstrate only that release of a document might increase the risk ‘that a law will be violated or that past \nviolators will escape legal consequences.’”  Id. at 205 (quoting Mayer Brown LLP v.  IRS (“Mayer Brown”), 562 F.3d 1190, \n1193 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).  “Rather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing how the law will be circumvented, \nexemption 7(E) only requires that the [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information \nmight create a risk of circumvention of the law.”  Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 (quoting Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at 1194 \n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).   \nHowever, it stretches the imagination to understand how disclosure of these “Notional CIR Requirements” could be \nexpected to risk circumvention of the law and here the agency has provide no such justification or explanation. \n \nAs stated in point four above, the Sierra Club has submitted numerous Freedom of Information Act requests regarding \nfencing along the US-Mexico border to various agencies.  Many of the documents that have been provided, including \nmany documents previously provided by Customs and Border Protection, would have been responsive to this FOIA and \nin a number of instances previously provided documents indicate the existence of other documents that Customs and \nBorder Protection should have provided in response to this request.   \n \nOn March 15, 2010 the Sierra Club submitted a Freedom of Information Request to Customs and Border Protection that \nwas nearly identical to the FOIA request that we are currently appealing.  Only the date range was different; the 2013 \nFOIA was intended to function as an update.  In response to the 2010 FOIA the Sierra Club ultimately received 8 CDs \nbetween June 2010 and October 2011 containing 148 documents.  While some redactions appeared to be arbitrary – for \nexample, every dollar amount was redacted, even when the number referred to publicly available sums such as CBP’s \ntotal appropriation from Congress – there was a great deal of important information that had not previously been made \nknown.  A number of the documents provided in response to that FOIA would also have been responsive to this FOIA, \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 11 of 13\nbut they were neither provided nor described in a Vaughn index.  The idea that since that time CBP has only produced \n10 extremely brief, highly confidential documents, strains credulity.  \n \nThe documents listed below highlight just a few of those which were previously provided by federal agencies that would \neither be responsive to this FOIA or indicate the existence of documents that CBP failed to provide, or even to \nacknowledge the existence of in a Vaughn index. \n \nPartial list of documents previously provided to the Sierra Club via prior FOIA requests: \n \n  PF 225 Phase II Draft Drainage Report Fence Segments O1, O2, O3 2-D Hydraulic Analysis of the Rio Grande \nFloodplain.  Dated June 2011.  Provided by Customs and Border Protection in October 2011.   \nThe final version of this report would be responsive to the Sierra Club’s FOIA request, along with emails, letters, \nmeeting notes, Powerpoints, and other documents which make reference to either the draft or final version.  \nOther reports discussing these proposed sections of border fence would likewise be relevant and responsive, \nand should be provided. \n \n  CBP Office of Finance Facilities Management and Engineering Tactical Infrastructure Update January 20, 2010.  \nPowerpoint provided by Customs and Border Protection in July 2010. \nThirty responsive Powerpoint presentations were provided in response to the Sierra Club’s earlier FOIA, but only \none Powerpoint, which was entirely redacted, was provided in response to this request.  CBP should provide all \nPowerpoint presentations, updates, and meeting notes that mention border fence sections O-1, O-2, and/or O-3 \nfrom 2010 through the present. \n \n  CBP Office of Finance Facilities Management and Engineering July 20, 2010 Briefing to Department of State \nPedestrian Fence Segments O-1, O-2 and O-3.  Powerpoint provided by Customs and Border Protection in May \n2011. \nThis Powerpoint was presented at a meeting in 2010, within the date range covered by this FOIA and explicitly \ndiscussing the topic of this FOIA.  Meeting notes, emails, letters, etc. related to this meeting are clearly \nresponsive to this FOIA and should be released. \n \n  Subject: Fw: Emailing 02-012(a)USIBWC Approval Letter Segments O-123.pdf.  February 23, 2012 email chain \nprovided by the US Army Corps of Engineers in April 2013. \nThis email from Loren Flossman says in part, “Sirs the attached letter to Scott Recinos from IBWC is the \nsuccessful conclusion of over 3 years of singular dedication and tenacity by Scott. His commitment has resulted \nin IBWC's approval of the O-1 O-2 O-3 fence segments which are part of the 670 miles of proposed fence.”  \nEmails, meeting notes, and correspondence covering the span of Mr. Recinos’s efforts related to these sections \nare relevant to our FOIA and should be provided.  The Sierra Club’s previous CBP FOIA led to the release of 18 \nemail chains, but the ten documents that were provided in response to this FOIA do not (so far as we can \ndiscern with their content entirely redacted) make any reference to these efforts or to the International \nBoundary and Water Commission. \n \n  U.S. Customs and Border Protection Secure Border Initiative Border Security, Fencing, Infrastructure and \nTechnology (BSFIT) Fiscal Year 2009 Expenditure Plan.  Provided by Customs and Border Protection in June 2010. \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 12 of 13\nThis is an annual report that CBP develops for Congress.  While the 2009 report would not fall within the 2010 \nthrough the present range of the FOIA which we are appealing, subsequent reports which make mention of \nborder fence sections O-1, O-2, and/or O-3 would. \n \n  Border Patrol Facilities and Tactical Infrastructure (BPFTI) Program Management Office (PMO) Real Estate Plan \nProposed Pedestrian Fencing Segments O-1, O-2, O-3 Starr & Hidalgo Counties, Texas.  November 30, 2012.  \nProvided by the US Army Corps of Engineers in April 2013. \nPlanning documents such as this are clearly responsive to the Sierra Club’s FOIA request, falling within its date \nrange and discussing the relevant subject matter.  CBP should release all similar planning documents that discuss \nproposed border fence segments O-1, O-2, and O-3. \n \nIf certain records are exempt from disclosure under FOIA CBP is still required to provide an index of those records that is \nsufficiently detailed for a reasonable person to be able to ascertain whether the record sought is actually exempt from \ndisclosure. Vaughn v. Rosen, 282 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  CBP did not provide an index of any type despite the \nundeniable fact that many documents were withheld from this FOIA request. \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, we respectfully request that Customs and Border Protection reverse the initial decision to redact the \nfew documents it has provided, promptly conduct an additional search and provide us with full access to the requested \ninformation.  The Sierra club has been waiting since April 2013 for this information. The lengthy and unreasonable delay \nby Customs and Border Protection is preventing us from fully understanding the impacts that Customs and Border \nProtection activities are having on threatened and endangered species and habitat, potential flooding and watershed \nimpacts, and issues of concern to our membership along the U.S.-Mexico border. Our interests have been and continue \nto be negatively impacted by this unreasonable delay and inappropriate redaction of information as well as the failure to \nproduce documents in the possession of Customs and Border Protection that are responsive to our original request.  \nAs we evaluate whether to seek judicial review of this matter, it would be useful for Customs and Border Protection to \nprovide us with a projected date-certain by which we can expect a determination of this appeal, as required by FOIA.  If \nCustoms and Border Protection has implemented a “first-in/first-out” system for processing FOIA appeals, we ask that \nyou inform us how many appeals are in line ahead of this one and that you take into consideration the fact that this \nFOIA request has been outstanding since April 2013.  \nPlease let us know how we can help you in your efforts to publicly disclose the important information contained in the \nrequested documents. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Sierra Club Borderlands Co-chair \nScott Nicol at (956) 532-5983 or lrgvsierraclub@gmail.com. \n \n \nScott Nicol \n \n \n \nCo-chair Sierra Club Borderlands Team \n \n7300 N. 32nd \nMcAllen, TX  78504 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-3   Filed 12/12/17   Page 13 of 13\nEnclosed: \n \nCopy of Sierra Club’s FOIA request from April 2013 \n \nBrief CIR Draft 1 7 _Redactedf   \n \nBH Schedule Comment Form 11 APR 13 a_Redactedf   \n \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-4   Filed 12/12/17   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit D \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-4   Filed 12/12/17   Page 2 of 3\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \nWashington, DC 20229 \nU.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection \nDIS-3 OT:RR:RDL:FA  PL \nCBP-AP-2017-028365 \no \nMAR  1  2017 \nMr. Scott Nicol \nSierra Club \n7300 N 32\"d \nMcAllen, TX 78504 \nRe:  Remand of Freedom of Information Act Request CBP 20 16-0 18165 \nDear Mr. Nicol: \nThis is in reply to your February 3, 2017, submission concerning the U.S. Customs \naaippGfnndereirdenedtasi qcenaBeiusldnno taegFrttr i  edOpaCsleneuyIirr Atb f tyrPeaj e,ensir sncaoucptniteb onedtm,ongc  a Ldt ittins ohootsd oensit o   t hEFy(ane\"coOb, C tcuayiIoBcnrAo naoAPu lssr r\"tpe,i r) nrqruT efiFuceqlrret1axueiss7oaeetts,n srda .ut 2 oreoc0emYdtf 1u  ibo C3nrouoe ,Bft  r)hi id IPnnienen id frtrU iioe tacfhcr.elaSmeo ntF. re cvadOdBitisnic Io oigiAdnrnn a d( i ytrtAaeiyeolrncsq u goPotur  a f (efsr\" trtseurhoFtofb emeOflm or'c IrsrJoiAe  saRmCds\"n iiB)mtuoo oaD Pnu Gra  inytrsrvhe i atia1tcnishto,eid  er2sote hd 0nbo seV1'o.f s 0sr a Redf,Il ancloeteiot rmliyy  uowto arhnseu,aees  lrRc  tl oo,ti o for   \nand are designated 0-1, 0-2, and 0-3. \nUnder the FOIA's administrative appeal provision, a requester has the right to \narSedeqmeu i5en sUitset.rSrsa. tCbive. ec§la y5u 5sae2p  pt(heaea) (la 6ap)np(Aye a)al.ds  vTperhrosece ae ddsesm tpeinrromisvtiirndaaettisivo aenn a  tpahgpaeet naalcn yp a rwgoecitnehcs sya n ims  oiapmkpeposor troutnan nhittiy st o tFo aO grIeeAvni cerieweqs u iatesns dt.  \ninitial action taken in response to a request to determine whether corrective steps are \nntrheeedcraeecsbsteyadr oy db. ovTciauhtmees ea nuptnpsne taeolcs ey sposruao rcbyeu sjtus i dta ildclooiaewls s rn eCovBtie aPwp .tp oe Iacnro  tarhrsie sic ftc  tamhseei s,F ttaOhkeIe AsF  mODIaiAvdie sD iaoitv nli osswieoaenrrc  rlheeelvedea lfssoe rda n acd e rtain \nnsrdepuiqdemuc nbiefoseittcr e asodel lfayi onr cti hydheoe frnuo trari  gfitineheinestics aveyla   rrrFeeiOoccouoIrsArd drs ses, u pytbohomreutrs iei,sd  spieisron eantsin.fe  inieHntdaco toiwinmo enypvsole,eu rpt,re l aaa aspnd psimt,e  aaainpnl.idp s eItorantar httshie vairses d   riroefecs ctuphomeerc deFt ,nfO otysIro A tuuh srDa  attio pwv prieseerivaoeli n e w \non appeal in this case. \nAccordingly, we are remanding your request to the FOIA Division for processing with \nilnetstterru. ctIifo tnhse t hFaOt ItAhe D reivqiuseiostn  sihso uunladb blee  tpor opcreoscseesds  wthiet hrienq utwesetn wtyi t(h2i0n)  tdwaeynst yfr (o2m0 )t hdea ydsa,t eth oe f this \nFAtoOs  yImoAue rDn triievoqinsueieodsn ta  sbinho ovdueisl,d tyr iaocdut v cmiosaeuy ryt .oi muP muorfes dtuhiaaent etti lmtyo e c5 hr aeUlql.uSein.rCge.ed   §tth5oe 5r 2Fe(sOap)Io(A4n)d D( Btiov) ,it shyieoo unre 'msq uafeaysi ltdu.o re s oto  inre tshpeo nd \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-4   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 3\nU.S. District Court in the district in which you reside or have a principle place of business, or \nin which the agency records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia. \nAlternatively, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers \nmediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a \nnon-exclusive alternative to litigation.

According to LMI’s website this work was quite expansive, and LMI and its employees \nrepeatedly pop up in FOIA documents that we have received from CBP and other agencies.  LMI \nemployees appear to have played an important role in the Secure Border Initiative Program \nManagement Office.  We have received some SBI PMO meeting minutes from 2007 and 2008 that \nindicate that meetings were held at LMI's McLean, Virginia office.   \n \nThe Sierra Club specifically seeks documents, including SBI PMO and other meeting minutes and \nnotes, as well as emails, memos, and reports, that involve and/or relate to the participation of LMI \nemployees in the Secure Border Initiative Program Management Office, and meetings at LMI's McLean, \nVirginia office from January 2006 through the present. \n \nPlease include emails, letters, call logs, and other communications regarding these meetings.  \nCustoms and Border Protection discussions, reports, updates, presentation materials such as \nPowerpoints, etc., that pertain to these meetings should be included.   \n \nPlease search responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.    \nOur request includes email, telephone messages, voice mail messages, daily agenda and calendars, \ninformation about scheduled meetings and/or discussions regarding the aforementioned topic, whether \nin person or over the telephone, agendas for those meetings and/or discussions, participants included in \nthose meetings and/or discussions, and transcripts, notes and/or minutes from any such meetings \nand/or discussions. \n \nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, the Sierra \nClub requests that you provide it with an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, \n484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1972).  As you are aware, a Vaugn index \nmust describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity “to permit a reasoned \njudgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.”  Founding Church of Scientology v. \nBell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979).  Moreover, the Vaugn index must “describe each document or \nportion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of supplying the \nsought-after information.”   King v. U.S. Department of Justice, 830 F. 2d 210, 223-24 (D.C. Cir. 1987) \n(emphasis added).  Further, “the withholding agency must supply ‘a relatively detailed justification, \nspecifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims \nwith the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.’”  Id. At 224 (citing Mead Data \nCentral v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977). \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-6   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 4\nIn the event that some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, \nplease disclose any reasonable segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C \n§ 552(b).  If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-\nexempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please \nstate what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the \ndocument.  Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261.  Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the \nsame degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaugn index.  If a request is denied in \nwhole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release. \n \nThe Sierra Club is primarily engaged in working to protect communities, wild places, and the \nnatural environment.  The Sierra Club is a non-profit corporation, organized under section 501(c)(4) of \nthe Internal Revenue code.  The release of information garnered through this request is not in the Sierra \nClub’s financial interest.  The Sierra Club will analyze the information responsive to this request, and will \nlikely share its analysis with the public, either through memoranda, reports, articles, or press releases.  \nThe Sierra Club has an established record of carrying out these types of activities.  The Sierra Club will \nalso deposit copies of all documents that are received with the Border Studies Archive at the University \nof Texas Rio Grande Valley, where they will be catalogued and made available free of charge to \nresearchers, students, and the general public. \n \n \nFee Waiver Request \n \nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. Part 5, the Sierra Club requests a \nwaiver of fees associated with processing this request for records.  The waiver is in the public interest \nbecause furnishing this information primarily benefits the general public.  The subject of this request \nconcerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better \nunderstanding of relevant government procedures by the Sierra Club and the general public in a \nsignificant way.  Moreover, the request is primarily and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes.  5 \nU.S.C. §552(a)(4)(A)(iii).  See, e.g., McClellan Ecological v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1285 (9th Cir. \n1987). \n \nThe records requested by the Sierra Club are likely to contribute to the public’s understanding of \nthe environmental impacts of border fencing along the U.S. – Mexico border.  This policy issue has been \nthe subject of frequent press inquiry and public debate. \n \nThe Sierra Club, along with its members, has published articles, reports, fact sheets, and other \neducational materials based on information that we have gained from documents received from a \nnumber of federal agencies via the Freedom of Information Act.  None of these resulted in any sort of \nfinancial profit for the Sierra Club.  In regards to border fencing, in addition to other types of educational \nmaterials a number of articles have been published by the Rio Grande Guardian, the Monitor, the Texas \nObserver, the Arizona Daily Star, the Associated Press, and other news outlets based on documents \nprovided to us through previous Freedom of Information Act requests.  These articles were written for \nthe sole purpose of educating the public, including readers of the Arizona Daily Star and the Rio Grande \nGuardian who live in border communities.  No payment of any kind was made to the Sierra Club for \nthese articles, or for any of the other articles that have been written based on these documents.  Copies \nof all of the documents regarding border fencing that the Sierra Club has received have been lodged at \nthe University of Texas Rio Grande Valley’s Border Studies Archive, where they are available to \nresearchers and the public.  At no point has the Sierra Club been assessed fees by Customs and Border \nProtection, US Fish and Wildlife, the Bureau of Land Management, US International Boundary Water \nCommission, US Army Corps of Engineers, or other federal agencies who have honored our previous \nFOIA requests pertaining to border fencing. \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-6   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 4\nIn considering fee waiver criteria, please note that the FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure, \nand that the fee waiver amendments of 1986 were specifically designed to afford groups such as the \nSierra Club access to government documents without the payment of fees.  As stated by the Chairman \nof the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee, “[A]gencies should not be allowed to use fees as an offensive \nweapon against requesters seeking access to Government information . . .”  132 Cong. Rec. S. 14298 \n(statement of Sen. Leahy).  The Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the amended statute \n“is to be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.”  McClellan Ecological \nSeepage Situation v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1284 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing Sen. Leahy).  The Ninth \nCircuit and the D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeals maintain that the amendment's main purpose is “to \nremove the roadblocks and technicalities which have been used by various Federal agencies to deny \nwaivers or reductions of fees under the FOIA.”  Id.; also see Judicial Watch, 326 F.3d at 1315.  \nTherefore, Congress and the courts unequivocally hold that the main legislative purpose of the \namendments is to facilitate access to agency records by noncommercial requesters and “watchdog” \npublic interest organizations, such as the Sierra Club, that use information obtained under FOIA to \nmonitor, and at times challenge, government activities, and to inform the general public about said \nactivities. As the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stated, the fee waiver provision was added to the FOIA \n“in an attempt to prevent government agencies from using high fees to discourage certain types of \nrequesters and requests,” with explicit reference to requests from journalists, scholars and non-profit \npublic interest groups.  Better Government Association v. Department of State, 780 F.2d 86, 93-94 (D.C. \nCir. 1986), quoting Ettlinger v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 596 F. Supp. 867, 876 (D. Mass. 1984). \n \nUnder these circumstances, the Sierra Club fully satisfies the criteria for a fee waiver. \n \nConclusion \n \nIf you have any questions about this request or foresee any problems in releasing fully the \nrequested records, please contact me at (956) 532-5983 or lrgvsierraclub@gmail.com.

This request is sent to you because \nyou were identified as the proper person to receive such requests.  If this request should be \ndirected at another person, please forward this request to that person. \n \nSierra Club is the nation’s oldest grassroots organization. It has more than 2.9 million \nmembers and supporters nationwide.  Sierra Club is dedicated to the protection and preservation \nof the natural and human environment.  Sierra Club’s purpose is to explore, enjoy and protect the \nwild places of the earth; to practice and promote the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystems \nand resources; and to educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural \nand human environments.  \n \nSierra Club is a leading non-governmental organization seeking to educate and mobilize \nthe public on issues of climate change, habitat destruction and impacts to species that would be \nimpacted by the Trump Administration’s proposed Border Wall.  Sierra Club’s Borderlands \nCampaign has been organizing around border issues for many years; this request is made on \nbehalf of this campaign, as well as the organization’s long standing interest in government \naccountability and transparency. \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 3 of 187\n \nSierra Club Requests the Following Records1 related to the Trump Administration’s \nProposed Border Wall: \n \n1.

To comply with legal requirements, the following information must be \nincluded: \n \n                                                 \n1 “Records” means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten, typed, electronic or otherwise \nproduced, reproduced or stored), letters, memoranda, correspondence, notes, applications, completed forms, studies, \nreports, reviews, guidance documents, policies, telephone conversations, telefaxes, e-mails, documents, databases, \ndrawings, graphs, charts, photographs, minutes of meetings, electronic and magnetic recordings of meetings, and \nany other compilation of data from which information can be obtained.  Without limitation, the records requested \ninclude records relating to the topics described below at any stage of development, whether proposed, draft, \npending, interim, final or otherwise. All of the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the possession of \nor otherwise under the control of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs & Border Protection \nand all of its Offices, Regions and other subdivisions. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 4 of 187\n \n1.  Basic factual material about each withheld item, including the originator, date, length, \ngeneral subject matter, and location of each item; and \n \n2.  Explanations and justifications for denial, including the identification of the category \nwithin the governing statutory provision under which the document (or portion thereof) \nwas withheld and a full explanation of how each exemption fits the withheld material. \n \nIf you determine that portions of a record requested are exempt from disclosure, please \nredact the exempt portions and provide the remainder of the record to the Sierra Club at the \naddress listed below.   \n \nFee Waiver Request \n \n  I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided \nby 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. § 5.11(k). The Sierra Club has spent years \npromoting the public interest through the development of policies that protect human health and \nthe environment, and has routinely received fee waivers under FOIA.   \n \nThe Sierra Club is a national, nonprofit, environmental organization with no commercial \ninterest in obtaining the requested information.  Instead, the Sierra Club intends to use the \nrequested information to inform the public, so the public can meaningfully participate in \nevaluating CBP’s operations and activities related to the proposed Border Wall. \n \n  As explained below, this FOIA request satisfies the factors listed in DHS’s governing \nregulations for waiver or reduction of fees, as well as the requirements of fee waiver under the \nFOIA statute – that “disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to \ncontribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government \nand is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), see \nalso 6 C.F.R. § 5.11(k). \n \n1.  The subject matter of the requested records must specifically concern identifiable \n“operations and activities of the government.” \n \n  The requested records relate to CPB’s activities regarding the proposed Border Wall.  \nThese activities are “identifiable operations or activities of the government.”   The Department of \nJustice Freedom of Information Act Guide expressly concedes that “in most cases records \npossessed by a federal agency will meet this threshold” of identifiable operations or activities of \nthe government.  There can be no question that this is such a case. \n2.  The disclosure of the requested documents must have an informative value and be “likely \nto contribute to an understanding of Federal government operations or activities.” \nThe FOIA Guide makes it clear that, in the Department of Justice’s view, the “likely to \ncontribute” determination hinges in substantial part on whether the requested documents provide \ninformation that is not already in the public domain. The requested records are “likely to \ncontribute” to an understanding of your agency’s activities and decisions because they are not \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 5 of 187\n \notherwise in the public domain and are not accessible other than through a FOIA request.  This \ninformation will facilitate meaningful public participation in the decision-making process, \ntherefore fulfilling the requirement that the documents requested be “meaningfully informative” \nand “likely to contribute” to an understanding of your agency’s decision-making process with \nregard to the proposed Border Wall .   \n3.  The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to \nthe individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons. \nUnder this factor, the identity and qualifications of the requester—i.e., expertise in the \nsubject area of the request and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the \npublic—is examined. \nThe Sierra Club and its members have long-standing experience and expertise in the \nsubject area of FOIA requests, specifically, issues related to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the development and the protection of endangered \nspecies.  Sierra Club also has a long standing interest in government accountability and \ntransparency. \nSierra Club disseminates the information it receives through FOIA requests in a variety \nof ways, including, but not limited to: analysis and distribution to the media, distribution through \npublication and mailing, posting on the Club’s website, emailing and list serve distribution to our \nmembers across the U.S., and via public meetings and events. Every year the Sierra Club website \nreceives 40,730 unique visits and 100,381 page views; on average, the site gets 104 visits per \nday. Sierra Magazine, which is a quarterly magazine published by the Sierra Club, has a \ncirculation of approximately 1,000,000. Sierra Club Insider, an electronic newsletter, is sent to \nover 850,000 people twice a month.  In addition, Sierra Club disseminates information obtained \nby FOIA requests through comments to administrative agencies, and where necessary, through \nthe judicial system. In the past, the Sierra Club has published, posted, and disseminated \nnumerous stories on coal and coal power plants regarding their impacts on health, the \nenvironment and alternative energy. This includes information on our various webpages, such as \nour Beyond Coal Campaign portal, our Clean Energies Solutions portal and our press releases.2 \nSierra Club intends to share the information received from this FOIA request with our \nimpacted members across the country, the media and our allies who share a common interest in \nthe proposed Border Wall.   \nSierra Club unquestionably has the “specialized knowledge” and “ability and intention” \nto disseminate the information requested in the broad manner outlined above, and to do so in a \nmanner that contributes to the understanding of the “public-at-large.”    \n                                                 \n2 For example, the Sierra Club sought information about coal export and permitting activities in Oregon via a state \npublic records act request at the Port of Coos Bay.  All correspondence is published online and has received \nextensive media attention from press releases on the subject. See \nhttp://content.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/lawsuit/2013/sierra-club-challenges-dirty-and-dangerous-fossil-fuel-\nexports-oregon. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 6 of 187\n \n4.  The disclosure must contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government \noperations or activities.  The public’s understanding must be likely to be enhanced by the \ndisclosure to a significant extent. \nThe records requested will contribute to the public understanding of the government’s \nrole, or their “operations and activities” associated with the proposed Border Wall.  The \ndisclosure of the requested records is essential to the public’s understanding of CBP’s operations \nand activities. After disclosure of these records, the public understanding of CBP’s activities will \nbe significantly enhanced.  The requirement that disclosure must contribute “significantly” to the \npublic understanding is therefore met. \n5.  Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested \ndisclosure. \nThe Sierra Club has no commercial interest in the requested records.  Nor does it have \nany intention to use these records in any manner that “furthers a commercial, trade, or profit \ninterest” as those terms are commonly understood.  The Sierra Club is a tax-exempt organization \nunder sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, and as such has no \ncommercial interest.  The requested records will be used for the furtherance of the Sierra Club’s \nmission to inform the public on matters of vital importance to the environment and public health. \n6.  Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is \nsufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is \n“primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” \nWhen a commercial interest is found to exist and that interest would be furthered by the \nrequested disclosure, an agency must assess the magnitude of such interest in order to compare it \nto the “public interest” in disclosure.  If no commercial interest exists, an assessment of that non-\nexistent interest is not required. \n  As noted above, the Sierra Club has no commercial interest in the requested records.  \nDisclosure of this information is not “primarily” in the Sierra Club’s commercial interest.  On the \nother hand, it is clear that the disclosure of the information requested is in the public interest.  It \nwill contribute significantly to public understanding of CBP’s activities regarding the proposed \nBorder Wall.   \n \nThe Sierra Club respectfully requests, because the public will be the primary beneficiary \nof this requested information, that CBP waive processing and copying fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(A) and 6 C.F.R. § 5.11(k).  In the event that your agency denies a fee waiver, please \nsend a written explanation for the denial.  Also, please continue to produce the records as \nexpeditiously as possible, but in any event no later than the applicable FOIA deadlines.  \n \nRecord Delivery \n \n  In responding to this request, please comply with all relevant deadlines and other \nobligations set forth in FOIA and the agency’s regulations.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i); 6 C.F.R. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 7 of 187\n \n§ 5.6. Please produce the records above by sending them to me at the address listed below.  \nPlease produce them on a rolling basis; at no point should the search for—or deliberation \nconcerning—certain records delay the production of others that the agency has already retrieved \nand elected to produce.   \n \n  If possible, please send all documents in PDF format via electronic mail, external \nwebsite, or on CD or DVD via traditional mail.  Alternatively, paper copies are acceptable, but \nelectronic format is preferred.

Security (DHS) Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Budget Amendment Congressional Justification \nDHS is submitting a request for an additional $3 billion appropriations to address the urgent needs of the Department to support the \nExecutive Orders on border security and immigration enforcement.  Funds requested for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \nwould support high priority tactical infrastructure and border security technology investments, including efforts to plan, design, and \nconstruct a physical wall along the southern border.  The request also includes funding for DHS agencies to begin building the \nadministrative capacity necessary to recruit, hire, train, and equip an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.  Further, the request proposes funding to increase daily immigration detention capacity to \n45,700 detention beds by the end of FY 2017.  This additional detention capacity is necessary to implement Administration policies \nfor removing illegal aliens from the United States by enhancing interior enforcement efforts.

IMMEDIATE BORDER WALL CONTRUCTION & PLAN \n \nOverview \n \nAs the frontline border agency in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has \nthe dual mission of preventing suspected terrorists, terrorist weapons, and other contraband from entering the United States, while also \nDHS- 10  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 19 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nfacilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel into and out of the United States.  CBP ensures that all persons and cargo enter the \nUnited States legally and safely through official checkpoints and ports of entry.  CBP achieves its mission using a combination of \nadvanced information, risk assessment, appropriate scanning and other technologies, and by partnering with Federal, state, local, \ntribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies as well as private industry and international partners.  CBP’s over 60,000 highly-trained \nemployees ensure that the agency performs its mission with vigilance, integrity, and professionalism. \n \nThe Operations and Support funds all operating costs required to achieve CBP’s dual mission.  The primary drivers behind these costs \nare the salaries and benefits (S&B) of CBP operational and mission support personnel.  The balance of this appropriation is comprised \nof the operations and maintenance (O&M) costs necessary to sustain the daily effectiveness of CBP equipment and facilities.  Without \nthe resources requested in this appropriation, CBP would experience a degradation of frontline operations.   \n \nThe following request is organized by the four specific sections within Executive Order 13767, “Border Security and Immigration \nEnforcement Improvements.”  \n \nImmediate Border Wall Technologies ($5M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $5 million in two-year funding to provide data circuits and network bandwidth for Border Wall surveillance data/video. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe expansion of CBP Border Wall Infrastructure with embedded Information Technologies  will significantly increase the amount of \ndata/video being transmitted to USBP operation center(s).  The increased transmission of data/video will require increased \ntechnologies, such as data circuits, and/or some other network capability, to be installed to ensure the quick, effective, and efficient \ntransmission of data.  These data links and associated network technologies will connect back to CBP’s existing network infrastructure \nwhich today consists of outdated and end-of-life technologies.  Funding will enable CBP to ensure that data/video captured from wall \ntechnologies can swiftly and effectively traverse CBP’s network to be acted upon quickly by United States Border Patrol (USBP) \nAgents.  Any delay in data transmission due to outdated and/or insufficient network bandwidth will have an adverse impact on \nUSBP’s ability to meet their daily operational mission requirements. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThe additional southwest Border Wall technologies will require network upgrades.  CBP will need an engineering contract to conduct \nbandwidth analysis, site design, and provide initial data circuit upgrade requirements to handle the increased data traffic that will \nDHS- 11  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 20 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nenable USBP’s effective monitoring of data from the southwest Border Wall embedded technologies.  Costs will recur and will \nexpand on capabilities as additional segments of the southwest Border Wall are completed.   \n \nAdditional funding will enable CBP to acquire network field equipment required to effectively monitor and control data traversing \nCBP’s IT network from the southwest Border Wall to monitoring locations within USBP sectors that are required with initial \nexpansion of the Border Wall.  As necessary, upgrades may be needed to the IT infrastructure at USBP sectors or stations that will \nhave day-to-day oversight of data captured by southwest Border Wall technologies.  In addition, funding will cover replacement of \nconsumable southwest Border Wall technologies, which may include items such as unattended ground sensors, surveillance cameras, \npower amplifiers, down converters, power supplies, and geological/infrared/step sensors and gaskets, etc.). \n \nOffice of Facilities and Asset Management Staff ($4.837M / 40 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $4.837 million in two-year funding for the salaries and benefits for an increase of 53 personnel (40 FTE / 53 FTP, all in \nFY 2018) across the two-year period in support of the Executive Order for the immediate construction and planning of the Border \nWall. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe Office of Facilities and Asset Management’s (OFAM) current areas of responsibility include managing and overseeing CBP’s \nTactical Infrastructure, facilities, vehicles, uniforms and personal property.  Executive Order 13767, “Border Security and \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements” included direction for the immediate construction and planning of a border wall, which \nrepresents a significant ramp up in mission, requirements, personnel, and funding needs for OFAM.   \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThe total of 40 Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) requested will work in full support of activities associated with the Executive Order, \nwhich includes initial planning, project management for construction, and also the continued oversight and maintenance of the Border \nWall upon completion of construction.  These positions are intended to be a permanent adjustment to the base as there will be \nsignificant work required to maintain the Border Wall and related tactical infrastructure even after planning and construction is \ncompleted. \n \nThe current baseline level of resources for OFAM only has the capacity to support current mission activities, which include the \ncontinued maintenance of the existing tactical infrastructure, facilities, vehicles, uniforms and personal property for the entire Agency. \nDHS- 12  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 21 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nAt the current resource level, CBP would be challenged to support the new Executive Order requirements without significant impacts \nto current baseline missions, which would include reallocating personnel that operate, maintain, and oversee operations of existing \nfacilities and to begin the planning efforts for the new facility and asset requirements associated with the expected increase in 5,000 \nBorder Patrol Agents. \n \nOffice of Chief Counsel Staff ($2.112M / 10 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $2.112 million in two-year funding to hire an additional 12 positions and 10 FTE (1 FTE in FY 2017 and 9 FTE in FY \n2018) within the Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC).   \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nOCC’s base request funds mission critical legal advice, representation, and counsel to CBP.  OCC is comprised of 29 offices (28 in \nfield locations), and is authorized to employ attorneys and support staff with unique expertise in, and knowledge of, laws enforced by \nor impacting CBP.  OCC handles all legal and ethics issues involving CBP’s global operations, both domestic and foreign.  OCC \nattorneys provide legal services to CBP officials in matters relating to the activities and functions of CBP, including matters involving \nenforcement, operations, real property, trade, fiscal, procurement, ethics, labor, and employment.  OCC requires supplemental funding \nto ensure timely implementation of the agency’s construction of the physical wall on the southwest border pursuant to the Executive \nOrder.   \n \nOCC’s comprehensive legal services to CBP include representing the agency in offensive and defensive litigation in all federal courts, \nas well as representing the agency in all third-party administrative hearings.  OCC will provide significant litigation support in defense \nof various challenges to the construction of the physical wall, including defending challenges to the Secretary of Homeland Security’s \nexercise of waiver authority under Section 102(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), as \namended, as well as in the condemnation of land along the southwest border.  OCC provides appropriations and fiscal law advice, \nreviews contractual, procurement, and real property actions, and ensures compliance of proposed agency actions and policies with \nlegal requirements.   \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nOCC has experienced a significant increase in legal services on enforcement matters, including immigration, litigation involving the \nagency’s detention and processing of aliens, and in legal services resulting from the agency’s expansion of the Tactical Infrastructure \nProgram, including the construction of a physical wall on the southwest border as mandated by Executive Order 13767, “Border \nDHS- 13  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 22 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements”.  OCC will require additional positions and non-pay funding to ensure the \nagency’s timely implementation of the EO requirements.   OCC anticipates an unprecedented increase in legal support in real \nproperty, procurement, fiscal law, as well as overall programmatic support to advance the construction of a physical wall.  Further, \nOCC will provide significant litigation support in defense of various challenges to the construction of the physical wall, as well as in \nthe condemnation of land along the southwest border.  For instance, if the Secretary of Homeland Security exercises the waiver \nauthority under Section 102(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), as amended, \nOCC will be responsible for defending any challenges to the waiver.  The waiver authority has been exercised five times; all five \ntimes were challenged in federal court.  Notably, in 2007, when the agency undertook the construction of 225 miles of pedestrian \nfencing (fence designed to prevent the illicit passage of people across the border) along the southwest border, the agency initiated \nnearly 400 land acquisition actions border-wide, 300 of which involved the filing of condemnation actions.    \n \nOperations Contract Support ($6M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $6 million in two-year funding for Operations Support, to produce documentation, integrate requirements, and allow for \nthe development of advanced metrics for the southwest border in support of Executive Order requirements. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe Joint Requirements Integration and Management System was developed, in part, to ensure that the operational missions of DHS \nwere pursuing the “right” capabilities to improve mission accomplishment supported by the analytical rigor necessary to support our \ndecision making.  The Acquisition Management Lifecycle is most effective when it can respond to well researched, measurable, \nachievable requirements.  In support of this, Capabilities and Requirements Division (CRD) was created to help bridge the gap \nbetween the operational community and the solution development community (including Acquisition).   \n \nWithin the Operations Support Office of CBP, the CRD is responsible for assisting the operational components in articulating their \nneeds and conducting the mission analysis to ensure CBP is pursuing the right capabilities.  Across government and industry, failed \nacquisitions and unsuccessful operational strategies can be traced back to an improper articulation of the actual need.  In addition, \nCRD also conducts operational test and evaluation to ensure that solutions delivered are effective and suitable to operate in their \nintended environment. \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 14  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 23 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nInvestment in this area will support the development of operational requirements for the Executive Orders regarding CBP operations \nincluding the border wall and operational control of the southwest border.  These resources will also support the development of \nconcepts of operation to articulate how the Executive Order parameters will impact the way CBP will operate.  In addition to \nrequirements and operational concepts, this investment will provide resources to determine the appropriate metrics to measure the \neffectiveness of CBP’s response to the Executive Orders as they are delivered.  The specific deliverables directly impacted by this \ninvestment will be the JRIMS’ Capability Analysis Study Plan (CASP) and the Capability Analysis Report (CAR) and the Acquisition \nLifecycle’s Mission Needs Statement, Operational Requirements Document, Concept of Operations, and Test and Evaluation Master \nPlan. \n \nConducting appropriate analysis increases the likelihood that delivered solutions achieve the desired result.  CRD has an established \nrelationship with CBP’s operational components and can provide immediate value from an increase in resources.  A current CRD \npriority is the development of Operational Concepts for each CBP operating domain to provide broad context for CBP’s needs and \nsupport gap analysis.  We are also engaged in requirements efforts across the spectrum of Executive Orders regarding CBP operations \nincluding the Wall andoperational control of the southwest border. Although part of CBP’s long term personnel strategy, the Agency \ndoes not currently grow this capability organically.  Additional contract staff will allow greater engagement with both CBP’s \noperational components as well as the Joint Requirements Council and the CBP program offices. \n \nII.  OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER \n \nTactical Infrastructure Investment ($21M / 0 FTE) \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) anticipates investing approximately $21 million for road maintenance within the overall \n$200 million investment in Tactical Infrastructure. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nCBP’s current TI portfolio requiring routine maintenance and repair needs includes approximately 654 miles of primary fence, 1,519 \ngates/crossings/game panels, 1,273 miles of roads, 14 bridges and 11 boat ramps. CBP requested $52.5 million to maintain and repair \nits tactical infrastructure portfolio.  \n \n \nDHS- 15  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 24 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nCBP’s spends approximately $49 million annually to support maintenance and repair requirements through the Comprehensive \nTactical Infrastructure & Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) program. Through the CTIMR program, contractors perform routine and \nurgent work such as infrastructure preventative maintenance, fence, gate and grate repairs, roadway maintenance (e.g., blading, \ngrading, drainage, structure clearing and silt removal, culvert replacement), vegetation control, and debris removal.  The additional \nfunds requested will address operational requirements for road maintenance across the southwest border in order to provide better, \nsafer, and more efficient border access for the Border Patrol.   \n \nTactical Communications ($20M / 0 FTE) \n \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requests $20 million in two-year funding to purchase 2,300 handheld radios ($10.12 \nmillion), 1,475 vehicle radios ($7.97 million), 95 base stations ($0.64 million), maintenance ($1.20 million), and circuits ($0.07 \nmillion) in support of USBP operations. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nTo support its mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal \ngovernment.  Tactical communications capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of CBP \nlaw enforcement agents and officers.  These agents and officers operate in remote areas where their radio is often their only \ncommunications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance.  CBP has a tactical radio communication device inventory of \nover 70,000 units utilized by the USBP agents, CBP officers, and Air and Marine agents. Over 25,000 units of CBP’s radio inventory \nhas exceeded its useful life and is no longer supported by the manufacturer.  \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThis funding would procure additional radios and infrastructure necessary to address radio obsolescence, improve interoperability with \nlocal authorities and the Government of Mexico, and address some current coverage gaps.  Replacing a significant number of aging or \nobsolete radios will directly contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of border security operations, and contribute to the goals \noutlined in the Executive Orders on border security and immigration enforcement.  \n \n \n \nDHS- 16  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 25 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nAMO Border Operations ($25.141M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $25.141 million in two-year funding to support Air & Marine Operations (AMO) 7 X 24 unmanned aircraft systems \n(UAS) operations along the southwest border of the United States.  In order to support the President’s Executive Order  \n13767, “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements”, CBP AMO proposes to contribute to the security of the \nsouthwest border by enhancing situational awareness through 7 X 24 UAS operations.  7 X 24 flight operations are defined as two \nscheduled 18 hour flights within a 24 hour period from each of AMO’s two National Air Security Operations Centers (NASOC) based \nin Corpus Christi, Texas and Ft. Huachuca, Arizona along the southwest border.    \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nCBP AMO UAS operations currently deploy specially equipped MQ-9 unmanned aircraft (UA) along the southern border of the \nUnited States.  Primarily operating along the borders of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona CBP deploys six of our nine UA from three \nair operations centers, two permanent and one expeditionary.  Based in Ft Huachuca, Arizona and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, \nTexas, CBP UAS support USBP and other Government agencies in maintaining border security as well as supporting local and \nnational emergency response actions.  CBP UAS activities include border surveillance through the use of two advanced sensors.  The \nMulti-Spectral Targeting System (MTS-B) electro optical infrared sensor allows CBP UAS to receive high definition real time video \nimagery in day and night conditions and is an excellent system for long range surveillance and tracking.  The Vehicle and Dismount \nExploitation Radar (VADER) provides accurate, real time dismounted ground moving target data and radar imagery supporting \nBorder Patrol Agents on the ground while simultaneously recording strategic intelligence data. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThis action is being pursued in order to support the President’s direction to secure the nation’s borders from illegal encroachment by \nhuman smugglers, illegal aliens, drug traffickers, and potential terrorists.  In order to support this goal, CBP AMO would leverage \ntheir UAS fleet and its ability to maintain long endurance land surveillance and dismounted target (human) tracking.  CBP’s UAS are \na key capability for homeland security, providing persistent surveillance and mobility to fill potential gaps along the southwest border. \nCBP’s UAS will mitigate risk, while construction of a physical barrier is implemented and provide decision makers with a flexible \ntool to respond to future security threats. \n \nWith the $25.1 million requested in FY 2017, CBP would hire 20 contractor personnel with an availability horizon of 18 to 24 months. \nThe timeframe for hiring contractor personnel will be dependent on the execution of the October 2017 UAS Services and operations \nsupport contract, availability of qualified candidates, and the CBP background investigation process.  Contractor support will include \nDHS- 17  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 26 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \naircraft, ground control station (GCS), and satellite technicians as well as VADER operations specialist and associated ground \nprocessing support.  In additional to the contract personnel, the increased flight activity will accelerate the program’s consumption of \nmaterials through increased periodic inspections, routine maintenance, and component failure.  Significant investments in spare parts \nand system upgrades will be required to sustain asset availability and reliability.   \n \nCBP will increase operating hours as the acquisition of contractor personnel, material, and infrastructure allow.  The initial plan for \nthese investments in FYs 2017 and 2018 would be: \n-  20 Contractor Personnel:    $4.6M \n-  GCS Upgrades:    $4.8M \n-  2 MTS-B EOIR Sensors:  $6.0M \n-  VADER Upgrades:    $3.6M \n-  UAS Spares:      $6.1M \n \nTethered Aerostat Radar System ($18.1M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $18.1 million in two-year funding for the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) program in FY 2017, to be used for \nthe deployment of two technology enhancements over the next two years:  \n  Deploy new weather management systems at current TARS sites to improve flight operations efficiency (more surveillance \no\nhours) and flight safety to protect TARS personnel and equipment. \n  Further, AMO will be ready to field test key technologies that now appear promising in the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) – \no\nthese technologies exist and perform well in DOD missions, but need to be piloted in scope and scaled for the border security \nrole. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nCBP AMO’s TARS system fulfills a unique, critical surveillance capability needed to maintain operational control of the U.S. \nsouthern border and associated air space.  TARS supports effective monitoring the southern border in areas where other infrastructure \nmay be in short supply. It is a key component to a risk-based approach for enhancing border security, and contributes to the goals \noutlined in the Executive Orders on border security and immigration enforcement.  The TARS system is over 30 years old and past its \nintended operating service life and needs to be refreshed or replaced in the coming years.  This amendment to the FY 2017 President’s \nBudget request will allow AMO to conduct field investigations and demonstrations with the most promising technology candidates \nthat will inform a future departmental investment decision for the future TARS capability.  Additionally, the funding will enable the \nacquisition and deployment of modern technology to replace failing weather management systems at today’s TARS sites.  These \nDHS- 18  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 27 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n“wind profilers” are essential to safe flight operations and, ultimately, to increase surveillance flight hours delivered to AMO law \nenforcement operators monitoring air and sea approaches to U.S. southern borders. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nAMO is leading an ongoing department capability analysis and gaps identification study of our overarching air domain awareness \nmission area.  A key element in this comprehensive study is the acknowledgement of how critical it is to overall CBP security \noperations to maintain persistent surveillance of low altitude air approaches to the U.S. southern border.  Today, TARS fulfills this \ncritical low-altitude surveillance capability, and AMO needs to prepare technologies and operational concepts for a future surveillance \ncapability as TARS system(s) retires over the next few years.  The funding requested will allow CBP to field test new technologies \nthat will enhance domain awareness and help the agency determine the best path forward for low-altitude surveillance capabilities. \n \nInclement weather, and the inability to observe and react to weather in a timely manner, is the primary threat to reliable and safe \nTARS system flight operations and effectiveness.  The past 19 of 21 catastrophic (and costly) aerostat mishaps over the previous two \ndecades, while the program was managed by DoD, were weather induced.  The funding requested will allow CBP to replace the onsite \nwind profiler units across the TARS fleet to improve weather awareness and alerts, and ultimately to increase surveillance time aloft, \nsafely and efficiently. \n \nOIT Equipment and Field Technology ($3.368M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $3.368 million in two-year funding to upgrade the Office of Information & Technology (OIT) equipment and field \ntechnology for the United States Border Patrol (USBP). \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nMuch of the existing equipment in the sectors and stations of USBP is beyond its useful life.  In order to gain operational control of \nthe border, CBP must also make sure that the equipment used by USBP is upgraded to minimize impact of system slowdowns or \noutages.  In addition, updated systems will minimize the potential of cyber intrusions from those that may desire to cause harm to \nCBP’s data or infrastructure.   CBP’s mission critical applications are vital to the daily detention activities performed by USBP \nAgents, as they must have timely access to critical data to determine admissibility. \n \n \n \nDHS- 19  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 28 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nFunds will upgrade data circuit capacity with the initial focus on the Tucson, Douglas, and Nogales USBP stations.  In addition, funds \nwill enable CBP to begin upgrade of aged USBP desktops, laptops, scanners, cameras, and other peripheral equipment that is no \nlonger supported by the original equipment manufacturer.   \n \nFacilities Support On The Southern Border ($20M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $20 million in two-year funding to address the highest priority needs for the continued maintenance and upkeep of the \nexisting facilities that support United States Border Patrol (USBP).  This includes funding the nationwide regional maintenance and \nminor repairs contracts for USBP facilities and ensuring that there is funding available to address emergency repairs as they arise \nduring the year of execution. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe USBP facilities inventory is comprised of over 6.5 million square feet including 135 Border Patrol Stations, 39 Permanent and \nInterim Checkpoints, 20 Sector Headquarters, 16 Forward Operating Bases and one Special Operations Group location.  The backlog \nof deferred maintenance requirements for USBP facilities is $175 million.   \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThe funding requested as part of this amendment will address the identified gap of $20 million for the regional preventative \nmaintenance and minor repair contracts along with funding for each sector to address a minimal level of emergency repairs across all \nof the USBP Sectors; the majority of the facilities that are supported are along the southern border.  These requirements are all \ncurrently unfunded and will result in the continued deterioration of facility conditions, the increased risk of operational impacts due to \nfacility downtime, and the lack of basic services. \n \nFunding will ensure that core facility services, including the continued maintenance, per warranty instructions, of core building \nsystems, are provided to USBP facilities nationwide.  This funding will also ensure that there are adequate resources to address \nemergency repairs that arise during the year.  Emergency repairs are issues that are not planned, cannot be deferred to a future date \nand must be addressed upon occurrence to minimize impacts to operational capabilities.  This includes fixing HVAC systems along \nthe southwest border, resolving backed up sewage systems and repairing leaking roofs.  The continued, uninterrupted operations of \nUSBP facilities will also be critical throughout the implementation of the current Executive Orders, which includes increased activity, \nDHS- 20  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 29 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nstaging and deployment of assets along the southwest border.  \n \nUSBP facilities provide the critical infrastructure that enables USBP to stage and deploy agents, and supports tactical and search-and-\nrescue teams; command, control, and communications activity; detention and processing; intelligence units, canine and horse \noperations; fleet maintenance and storage; and administrative, training and law enforcement coordination.  \n \nIII.  INCREASE BPA FLOOR BY 5,000 \n \nUnited States Border Patrol Relocations ($25M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $25 million in two-year funding to support the United States Border Patrol (USBP) Voluntary Relocation Program \n(VRP) relocations and to initiate a USBP relocation incentive strategy.  $15 million will be used for USBP Relocations specifically \nutilizing VRP authority, and $10M for a USBP relocation incentive strategy for remote locations.    \n \nBACKGROUND \nAs a first step in hiring 5,000 additional Border Patrol Agents, CBP must pursue smart strategies to minimize attrition of current, \nexperienced BPAs.  Implementing a stable relocation program for the USBP workforce will meet operational requirements and help to \nalleviate the lack of mobility significantly contributing to declining morale and increased attrition across the workforce.  Although the \nattrition rate for Border Patrol Agents (BPA) dropped from FY 2015 (5.5%) to FY 2016 (4.3%), the current BPA attrition rate (year to \ndate FY 2017) has risen to 4.5%.  To achieve needed mobility, CBP proposes to begin implementing an incremental mobility program \nin FY 2017.  The resultant mature program focuses the bulk of resources on mobility, addressing operational needs and documented \nemployee concerns. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThis funding will allow CBP to develop and implement a robust relocation program to stem the current attrition patterns, supported by \ndata from internal/external surveys of BPAs.  These surveys indicate that the inability to relocate is a key contributing factor in the \ndecision to depart.  This is especially true of mid-career BPAs who feel there is no opportunity to either relocate to a more desirable \nlocation or advance from their current position.  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, the Office of Human Resources Management \nsurveys, and the USBP Human Capital Study show a strong correlation between agent mobility and lower morale and higher attrition.  \nThese same surveys indicate USBP espirit de corps remains strong when the U.S. Government’s immigration enforcement system is \nexecuting the laws of the nation.  \n   \nDHS- 21  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 30 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nPolygraph Examiner Recruitment & Retention ($4.271M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $4.271 million in two-year funding for recruitment and retention efforts targeted towards federally certified polygraph \nexaminers.   \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nFederally certified polygraph examiners possess a technical skill that is highly sought after by all 27 federal agencies that currently \npossess a polygraph capability.  In order to maintain CBP’s current capacity for the hiring of 5,000 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs), the \nOffice of Professional Responsibility (OPR) will need to retain their current employees, which has been difficult to accomplish in an \nincreasingly competitive workforce.  Adequate staffing of federally certified polygraph examiners within OPR is of critical \nimportance to the frontline hiring requirements of CBP, due to the requirements of the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010, P.L. 111-\n376, as amended, that all applicants for law enforcement positions in CBP receive a polygraph examination before being offered \nemployment.  Currently, CBP has 103 examiners on board with an additional 16 expected to EOD by the end of FY 2017.  \n \nMost other federal agencies that employee polygraph examiners use some form of additional compensation, putting pressure on CBP’s \nability to recruit and retain certified examiners. These approaches include Law Enforcement Availably Pay (LEAP), Administratively \nUncontrollable Overtime (AUO), and Special Salary Rate (SSR) pay-banding techniques.  This normally equates up to 25% of the \nemployee’s salary resulting in salaries much higher than the basic locality pay that CBP can offer.   \n \nAs a result of this competition, CBP has seen a high attrition in its polygraph examiner workforce, up to almost 19% in FY \n2015.  Currently, an additional 43 law enforcement officers supplement the examiner staff, but will return to their home offices and \nwill require replacement in the short term. With current hiring patterns for just CBPOs and BPAs, OPR processes around 8,000 \npolygraph examinations in a fiscal year. In order to meet the increased processing requirement to onboard an additional 5,000 BPAs, \nCBP will likely increase the number of examinations required and without sufficient polygraph examiner staff risks slowing the hiring \ntimeline. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nAs a result, OPR is requesting a strategy to retain current polygraph examiners through a 10% retention incentives and a 10% special \nsalary rate.  CBP estimates for FY 2017, OPR will require $1.258 million for FY 2017, and $3.013 million for FY 2018.  CBP’s \ncalculations assume that the 10% retention incentive will be paid out in a lump sum in FY 2017 to all 52 certified polygraph examiner \npositions that perform polygraph examination duties as a primary responsibility and are not law enforcement officers, as defined in 5 \nDHS- 22  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 31 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S.C. 5541(3) and 5 CFR 550.103, anticipated to be on board in FY 2017.  The 10% special salary rate will take effect in FY 2017 \nand will be paid to all 52 polygraph examiners anticipated to be on board in FY 2017.   \n \nExpand HRM Hiring Capacity ($21.129M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $21.129 million in two-year funding for the following initiatives: hiring hub program ($9.7 million); additional \napplicant processing ($7.8 million); recruiter training ($2 million); and recruitment/digital media strategy ($1.629 million).   \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nTo establish and sustain adequate staffing on the Nation’s borders, CBP must ensure its recruitment capabilities are commensurate \nwith the expanding complexity and demands of its mission in order to become the employer-of-choice for law enforcement \nprofessionals.  In light of the Executive Order requirement to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol Agents (BPA) and all associated \npositions, CBP requires additional funds and resources to strengthen five key areas of focus:  \n•  Hiring Hubs: Hiring Hubs have been very successful in decreasing the time-to-hire.  Throughout FY 2016, CBP continued to \nmodify the pre-employment process to expand the Hiring Hub concept to as many applicants as possible while reducing costs. \n•  Applicant Processing: Applicant processing comprises initial qualifications testing, medical examination, drug testing, and physical \nfitness testing.  This process also includes the polygraph and background investigation, which are administered by the Office of \nProfessional Responsibility.  CBP’s pre-employments process ensures a fair and consistent approach to hiring individuals who are \nqualified to perform the duties of the job. \n•  Recruiter Training:  Recruiters are the brand ambassadors of CBP and have a pivotal role in keeping applicants engaged throughout \nthe hiring process.  There are currently 1,400 recruiters within CBP.  Currently, CBP does not have standardized recruiter training \nacross all operational components.  To fulfill this priority, CBP must develop a comprehensive recruiter training curriculum for its \nfull-time and collateral duty recruiters. \n•  Recruitment Strategy:  Attracting a sufficient number of quality citizens to apply to CBP requires a concerted effort to focus not \njust on traditional recruitment efforts but also on digital media to attract applicants who are more engaged on mobile devices and \nthe Internet in general. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nHiring Hubs \nThis new frontline hiring process has consistently resulted in a reduction in time-to-hire.  Funding will be utilized to provide the \nincrease in staffing, contract services, and technology needed to continue this transformational effort.  CBP’s execution plan includes \nDHS- 23  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 32 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nthe following initiatives:  \n•  Renew space lease contracts for the Laredo and El Paso hubs, as well as other locations as volume of applicants dictates; \n•  Continued process improvements; \n•  Implementation of new hiring hubs for applicants in areas of the country where CBP personnel are not readily available to perform \ninterviews and polygraph exams; and \n•  Continuation of Military hiring hubs. \n \nAdditional Applicant Processing \n•  As the process is currently configured, these funds will allow CBP to initially process over 57,000 applicants.  We anticipate an \nincrease in the number of applicants through enhanced recruiting efforts and in the number of EODs as the hiring process continues \nto be transformed and streamlined. \n•  OPM-mandated pre-employment tests are an important part of the hiring process that help determine each applicant’s suitability to \nbe a frontline CBP employee.  Failure to fund this program to the extent necessary will significantly impact CBP’s ability to meet \nthe established hiring goals.  \n•  The medical services and drug testing collection services contract provides services to conduct the required medical examination, \nqualifications testing, and drug testing hiring steps.  Not fully funding this contract would prevent applicants from completing \nhiring steps and prevent CBP from onboarding applicants into positions with medical or drug testing requirements. \n•  The Pre-employment Fitness Test 1 contract provides PFT1 administration to all applicants and is a CBP hiring requirement.  Not \nfully funding this contract would delay applicant processing and therefore increase the time-to-hire. \n \nRecruiter Training \nCBP’s recruiter training program consists of two modules: core recruiter training and Special Emphasis Recruitment Team (SERT) \ntraining.  CBP anticipates using the estimated $2 million FY 2017 funding to provide travel and associated costs for training at the \nCBP Advanced Training Center in West Virginia for more than 400 recruiters.  SERT recruiters will remain three additional days to \ncomplete the SERT module, which focuses on veteran recruitment and enhancing the diversity of the workforce.  The funding will be \nput toward all travel costs for participants and trainers.  CBP’s goal is to leverage its certified recruiter workforce through train-the-\ntrainer sessions, with the goal of reaching 3,000 recruiters across CBP. \n \nRecruitment Strategy \nCBP seeks to increase the number of qualified applicants entering the hiring pipeline to enable CBP to meet its frontline staffing \ngoals.  CBP’s lack of brand awareness is contributing to the low number of Entries on Duty for its frontline positions.  The funding \nrequested will allow CBP to take the initial steps toward implementing its larger recruitment and marketing strategy.  Increasing \nrecruitment and marketing will also enable CBP to: \nDHS- 24  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 33 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n•  Ensure alignment to CBP’s brand messaging and incorporate available social media platforms, online job boards, and strategic \npartnerships that best allow CBP to communicate job opportunities to the desired applicant demographic; \n•  Enhance the applicant’s user experience in CBP’s digital environment; \n•  Determine whether current digital marketing and recruitment messaging are yielding the desired Return on Investment ; \n•  Analyze website traffic to understand user behaviors and levels of engagement; \n•  Identify opportunities for marketing initiatives and analyze existing marketing performance against goals and objectives; and \n•  Utilize online behavioral data to reach potential applicants where they are with a message that is relevant to them. \n \nAdditional HRM and OPR Staffing ($15M / 98 FTE) \n \nCBP is requesting $15 million in two-year funding for 89 positions and 71 FTE for the Office of Human Resources Management \n(HRM) and 33 positions and 27 FTE for the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).  HRM plans to onboard 5 FTE in FY 2017 \nand 66 FTE in FY 2018.  OPR intends to onboard 2 FTE in FY 2017 and 25 FTE in FY 2018. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThese positions are requested to provide direct support to the recruitment, hiring, and sustainment of the 5,000 additional Border \nPatrol Agents (BPA) and all associated positions.    \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nHRM and OPR are requesting a total of 122 new employees over a two year period to implement Executive Order 13767, “Border \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements.”  These positions are required to support CBP recruitment, hiring and law \nenforcement efforts to increase CBP's law enforcement population by the 5,000 Border Patrol Agents required in the Executive Order.  \nWithin OPR,the Personnel Security Division will have responsibility for determining the suitability for employment and eligibility to \nhold a National Security position for all new hires.  OPR has been tasked by CBP with continuously monitoring staff to ensure that \nthey remain suitable for employment based on a review of information such as criminal activity and suspicious financial transactions. \n \nHRM’s staffing request is essential to managing anticipated increases in the number of applicants, recruitment actions, and \nmaintaining CBP’s current time-to-hire improvements in light of increased hiring required in Executive Order 13767, as well as \nsustaining an effective law enforcement workforce.  HRM’s request was developed by comparing the ratio of Human Resource (HR) \nemployees to the total workforce in other DHS components, by applying the Office of Personnel Management standard ratio of one \nHR employee for every 100 employees.   \nDHS- 25  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 34 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n \nIV.  DETAIN ALL IMMIGRATION VIOLATORS \n \nIncrease Temporary CBP Detention Facilities ($95M / 0 FTE) \n \nCBP requests $95 million to address migration surge operations to include the rollout of soft-sided structure facilities in Tornillo and \nDonna, TX.  CBP southern land border ports of entry and areas between the ports of entry experienced extraordinary levels of \nunlawful migration at the beginning of FY 2017 as thousands of foreign nationals, unaccompanied alien children (UAC), and family \nunits (FMUA) attempt to migrate to the U.S. via Central American land routes.   \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nBeginning in the summer of 2016, United States Border Patrol USBP began to report an increase in apprehensions along the southwest \nborder, which included UC and FMUA populations.  FY 2017 started with apprehensions roughly 40% above average for the last five \nfiscal years. CBP has developed contingency planning for multiple soft-sided facilities including the rollout of facilities in Tornillo \nand Donna, TX.  Theses temporary facilities help CBP to mitigate the migration surge volume and create an increased capacity for the \noverflow at the stations and ports of entry.   \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nIn addition to the costs of the temporary detention facilities, CBP has incurred costs in critical overtime, TDY, transportation, supplies, \nand maintenance to support the surge operations. The effect is not limited to the southwest border, but felt nationwide as USBP and \nOFO create vacancies in inland, northern, and coastal areas to detail agents and officers to the southwest border.  Through January, \nCBP incurred $35 million in costs related to the southwest border surge, which required diverting funds from other operational needs.  \nThe requested funding is critical to maintain CBP’s capacity through the seasonal influx normally seen in the spring and summer \nmonths.   \n \n \nDHS- 26  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 35 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nOperations and Support \nPay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \nFunds requested include: \n•  $4.837 million is to hire 53 positions and 40 FTE, all in FY 2018, for Office of Facilities and Asset Management Staff. \n•  $10.527 million is to hire 122 positions and 98 FTE (seven in FY 2017 and 91 in FY 2018) for Additional HRM and OPR \nStaff. \n•  $25 million is for USBP Relocations. \n•  $19.88 million is for USBP agent and CBPO overtime in support of migration surge operations. \n•  $1.773 million is to hire 12 positions and 10 FTE (one in FY 2017 and 9 in FY 2018) for Office of Chief Counsel Staff. \n•  $4.271 million is for OPR Retention and Special Salary Rates. \n   \nDHS- 27  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 36 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nOperations and Support \nNon Pay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \nFunds requested include: \n•  $20 million is for Facilities Support on the Southern Border. \n•  $18.143 million is for Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS). \n•  $25.141 million is for AMO Border Operations. \n•  $3.368 million is for OIT Equipment and Field Technology. \n•  $5 million is for Immediate Border Wall Technologies. \n•  $21.129 million is to Expand HRM Hiring Capacity. \n•  $75.12 million is to Detain All Immigration Violators. \n•  $20 million is for Tactical Communications. \nDHS- 28  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 37 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n•  $6 million is for Operations Contract Support. \n•  $.339 million is for Office of Chief Counsel Staff. \n•  $21 million is for Tactical Infrastructure. \n•  $4.473 million is for Additional HRM and OPR Staff. \n   \nDHS- 29  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 38 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nProcurement, Construction, and Improvements \nBudget Amendment Funding Request \nDollars in Thousands \nFY 2019\nOrganization Name POA Ammendment Request\nAmount\n            Procurement, Construction, and Improvements $                                   1,377,483\n                Border Security Assets and Infrastructure 2017/2021 $                                   1,377,483\n \n   \nDHS- 30  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 39 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nProcurement, Construction, and Improvements \nNon Pay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \nDHS- 31  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 40 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n Border Infrastructure Investment \n \nInvestment Description \n \nCBP requests $999 million in 5-year funding to support construction of a Border Wall.  This amendment to the FY 2017 President’s \nBudget supports a robust suite of infrastructure investments to help CBP achieve operational control of the southern border, as required \nby the President’s Executive Orders on border security.  CBP anticipates investing approximately $999 million in FY 2017.  \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nThe $999 million investment includes the construction of a new Border Wall system in areas identified by United States Border Patrol \n(USBP) as operational requirements, to include: \n \n•  ~14 miles of new border wall system in San Diego Sector ($251M) \n•  ~14 miles of replacement fence in San Diego Sector ($102M) \n•  ~28 miles of new levee wall system in Rio Grande Valley Sector ($498) \n•  ~6 miles of new border wall system in Rio Grande Valley Sector  ($146M) \n \nThe costs above are estimates that will be refined as projects are further defined and designs are developed.  This funding will allow \nCBP to fund design, real estate planning, environmental planning and acquisition, construction and construction oversight for a new \nborder wall system to include fence replacement in San Diego, as well as a new border wall system and levee wall system in the Rio \nGrande Valley Sector. The anticipated investment allows CBP to swiftly respond to Administration priorities and USBP operational \nrequirements.  \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nDetailed requirements for the border wall, including priority locations and preferred features, are currently under development by \nCBP.  Concurrently, CBP is reaching out to industry to seek proposals for Border Wall prototypes that will help the agency select the \nappropriate design, materials, and technologies for further border wall construction.  These proposals and the subsequent prototypes \nwill allow CBP to estimate the overall cost to construct, maintain and repair the border wall.  This standard will continue to inform \nCBP’s wall estimates and will account for Administration priorities, USBP operational requirements, cost effectiveness, \nconstructability, and durability.  The identified locations are based off of operational need and site accessibility.   \n \nDHS- 32  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 41 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nKey Milestone Events: Wall Activities  \n \nThe $999 million investment includes the construction of a Border Wall and levee wall system in areas identified by USBP as \noperational requirements, to include but not limited to, San Diego and the RGV Sector area of responsibility in Texas, respectively.  \n \nFY 2017 Q3  \nCBP anticipates:  \n•  Finalizing all Interagency Agreements to providing funding to the United States Army Corps of Engineers \n(USACE) pending available funding.  \n•  Finalizing the first draft of the environmental impact.  \n•  Working with USBP to identify initial border wall segment requirements in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.  \n \nFY 2017 Q4  \n         \nCBP anticipates:  \n•  Identifying impacted landowners (assuming no significant title search delays).  \n•  Developing initial project scope, cost estimates, and schedule. \n•  Releasing Requests for Proposals.  \n•  Awarding Multiple Award Task Order Contract pending available funding.  \n \nSW Border Surveillance \n \nInvestment Description \n \nCBP requests $200 million in 5-year funding to support southwest border surveillance technology.  The $200 million requested will \nenable USBP to purchase approximately 18 Integrated Fixed Towers (IFT), 18 relocatable towers, 19 Mobile Video Surveillance \nSystems (MVSS) units and 58 MVSS camera upgrades.  Other funding will be used to close future sustainment gaps in Remote Video \nSurveillance Systems (RVSS), MVS, and mobile surveillance requirements.  Based on the current threat matrix, the Office of Border \nPatrol has determined that the priority sectors to receive these capabilities are Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Laredo (LRT), and El Paso \n(EPT) .   \n \n \n \nDHS- 33  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 42 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nFunding is requested to accelerate deployments of fixed and mobile surveillance technologies to high-risk locations along the \nsouthwest border.  These investments will help the Border Patrol deter, deny, identify, track, and resolve illegal activity along the \nborder to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.  Specific locations will be determined by \noperational requirements and capability gap analyses conduced by the USBP.  \n \nThe IFT system will assist USBP agents in detecting, tracking, identifying, and classifying items of interest along our Nation’s \nborders through a series of fixed surveillance towers and equipment that display information on IFT workstations housed in a \ncommand and control center.  \n \nRVSS is a fixed technology that provides persistent wide-area surveillance for the visual detection, identification, classification, and \ntracking of Items of Interest (IoI) along the border.  The RVSS unit configuration varies depending on the operational needs and the \ngeographical area where the RVSS is located.  RVSS units are typically deployed in areas of activity with dense vegetation, or urban \nareas where IoIs can quickly vanish.  The RVSS unit has a sensor suite with a set of short-, medium-, or long-range electro-optical and \ninfrared cameras (daytime/nighttime cameras), which are remotely operated from a Command and Control (C2) facility. The sensor \nsuite may contain an infrared illuminator, directional spotlights, and a public address system to broadcast verbal commands and \nwarnings.  These systems contribute to improved situational awareness, increased agent safety, and rapid response.  \n \nMVSS technology enables the visual detection, identification, classification, and tracking of IoIs in both urban and remote areas along \nthe border.  They are mobile systems that cover areas that are not covered by fixed surveillance technology deployments.  These \nsystems contribute to improved situational awareness, rapid response, and agent safety. The High Definition (HD) camera upgrade \nwill improve the Border Patrol operator’s ability to classify IoIs (i.e. long arms, bundles, and group size) which will result in greater \nagent safety and improved response time by Border Patrol agents. \n \nKey Milestone Events \n \nMVSS: \n•  Achieve Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) – 2 (DHS Approval for production of MVSS units) \n•  Begin contracting actions necessary to acquire MVSS capabilities; \n•  Execute contract delivery order for 19 MVSS units and 58 HD Camera Upgrades; \n•  Begin delivery of 19 MVSS units and 58 HD Camera Upgrades; and \n•  Complete deployment of 19 MVSS units and 58 HD camera upgrades. \nDHS- 34  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 43 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n \nIFT  \n•  Begin contracting actions necessary to acquire IFT capabilities; \n•  Validate Southwest Border Plan sites and priorities with USBP; \n•  Complete environmental and real-estate actions for sites and roads; \n•  Execute contract award after funding is received; \n•  Construction to begin within 6-8 months of contract award; and \n•  Sites operational beginning 10 months after start of construction. \n \nThere are several major assumptions that support these IFT milestones:  \n•  IFT Program is adequately staffed to support accelerated/concurrent deployments of 18 sites within two AoR’s; \n•  All sites are validated and approved by USBP leadership; \n•  Contract award through  “other than full and open competition” (FAR method); \n•  Contract award may occur prior to roads and sites being prepared for construction; and \n•  Maximize environmental waivers and unilateral condemnation. \n \nRe-locatable Tower (RVSS) Key Milestones: \n•  Begin contracting actions necessary to acquire RVSS capabilities; \n•  RVSS Re-locatable Approval – Milestone 1 (USBP HQ decision to utilize Re-locatable Towers based on results); from Re-\nlocatable tower pilot projects.  \n•  Obligate funding for Re-locatable Towers and modular Command and Control Centers – 0 to 3 months from approval; \n•  Identify Deployment AOR & Confirm the Laydown in coordination with USBP – 3 months from approval;   \n•  Obtain Environmental Clearances – 6 months from approval; \n•  Radio Frequency Authentication (RFA) – 6 months from approval; \n•  Obtain Real Estate Licenses – 9 months from approval;  \n•  Delivery of Re-locatable Towers and modular Command and Control Centers – 12 months from approval; \n•  Technology Deployment – 18 months from Approval; \n•  System Acceptance Testing – 21 months from Approval; and \n•  System Acceptance – 24 months from Approval. \n \nThere are several major assumptions which support these Re-locatable (RVSS) milestones: \n•  The results of the RVSS Re-Locatable Towers Pilot Project indicate no major impact to system performance (tower stability, \nDHS- 35  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 44 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nheight limited to 80 ft., and modular C2) compared to use of Fixed towers; \n•  A sole source justification is approved for using the current technology contractor; \n•  The tower sites are previously disturbed areas not requiring environmental assessments; and \n•  Real Estate license agreements can be secured. \n \nTactical Infrastructure Investment \n \nInvestment Description \n \nCBP anticipates investing approximately $179 million for road construction and other tactical infrastructure (TI).  $55M is required for \nthe completion of the RGV gates project. The remaining $124M will be used to construct new road requirements to provide USBP \nenhanced access for enforcement in high priority locations across the Southwest border. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nHistorically, CBP’s budget has not included capital investment funding to meet U.S. Border Patrol’s new road construction \nrequirements and other new critical TI needs. CBP has not had the capital investment funds to acquire the real estate and build gates \nfor the RGV fence gate openings. The gate openings cannot be closed until CBP acquires real estate access from the land owners who \nhave property behind the gates. Currently, CBP’s TI budget only supports up to $49M in maintenance and repair requirements through \nthe Comprehensive Tactical Infrastructure & Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) program. Through the CTIMR program, contractors \nperform routine and urgent work such as infrastructure preventative maintenance, fence, gate and grate repairs, roadway maintenance \n(blading, grading, drainage, structure clearing and silt removal, culvert replacement), vegetation control, and debris removal. \n \nJUSTIFICATION \n \nEfforts included in this budget request support the President’s Executive Order to secure the Nation’s border.  Funding will be used to \nconstruct new roads, secure critical access points with gates and obtain real estate license agreements in the U.S. Border Patrol’s \nhighest priority area. \n \nOn average, CBP spends approximately $49 million annually to maintain and repair its tactical infrastructure portfolio; however, this \ndoes not cover the entire requirement.An additional $179 million is requested for new road construction and other tactical \ninfrastructure needs.  USBP continuously identifies new road construction requirements that are necessary to patrol and access the \nborder to execute maintenance and repair needs.  Approximately $122 million of the funds requested will address operational \nDHS- 36  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 45 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nrequirements for road construction across the southwest border in order to provide better, safer, and more efficient border access for \nthe Border Patrol.  Of the funds requested, $57 million will allow CBP to acquire land necessary to install gates that complete an \nunfinished Pedestrian Fence 225 (PF225) project in the Rio Grande Valley.  During PF 225, CBP constructed approximately 55 miles \nof pedestrian fence in the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector. To ensure no obstruction of the flood plain in that area, fencing \nwas constructed north of the physical border, in some cases up to a mile.  This required CBP to construct gates to allow both USBP \nand private land owners access to land south of the fence.  Approximately half of the required gates have already been completed. \nHowever, the remaining 35 gaps in the fence cannot be gated until such time as CBP receives the funds required to address the real \nestate requirements associated with this project. \n \nKey Milestone Events \n•  $122M for new road construction \n  FY 2017 Q3 - Confirm USBP's prioritized new road construction requirements \no\n  FY 2017 Q4 - Obligate funding to USACE by the end of FY 2017  \no\n•  $57M for gates (other TI)  \n  FY 2017 Q3 - Begin working with USACE to conduct title research for the RGV Gates Construction project in \no\npreparation for real estate acquisition and gate construction  \n  FY 2017 Q4 - Obligate funding to USACE by the end of FY 2017 for construction activities  \no\n \n   \nDHS- 37  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 46 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOperations and Support \nBudget Amendment Funding Request \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \nDHS- 38  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 47 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOperations and Support \nPay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 39  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 48 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOperations and Support \nNon Pay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n   \nDHS- 40  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 49 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nMission Support – O&S \n \nICE requests $65.8 million for 50 Full-Time Positions (FTPs) and 63 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) (13 FTE in FY 2017 and 50 FTE \nin FY 2018) to begin developing a robust internal structure for the Office of Human Capital (OHC) and the Office of Professional \nResponsibility (OPR) that will support hiring the 10,000 law enforcement officers (LEO) and additional support personnel required to \nimplement the Executive Orders.  ICE requests that these funds be appropriated with a period of availability through September 30, \n2018. \n \nPay: $8.696 million \n \nICE will hire 50 positions, of which 37 are Human Resource (HR) Specialists in OHC and 13 are for OPR’s Personnel Security Unit \n(PSU).  The requested positions will be hired during the last quarter of FY 2017 and fully annualized in FY 2018. \n \nAccording to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the recommended ratio of HR Specialists to agency employees \nwithin the federal government is 1:100.  The 37 HR specialists requested in FY 2017 will provide ICE the administrative support for \nhiring its new personnel at this ratio, allowing OHC to meet the demands of the hiring surge.  The HR specialists will be located at the \nDallas and Laguna Niguel Service Centers, which are responsible for all administrative functions related to ICE LEO and support staff \nhiring. \n \nOPR is the critical next step in the hiring process after an applicant is selected for employment.  OPR PSU conducts and adjudicates \nsuitability background investigations of contractor, law enforcement, and support personnel at ICE.  The requested 13 PSU positions \nwill allow OPR to promptly clear employees to support the EO hiring surge.   \n \nNon-Pay: $57.128 million \n \nDuring the remainder of FY 2017 and throughout FY 2018, OHC will increase its recruitment efforts by implementing a \ncomprehensive “One Stop” hiring program, which will allow ICE to interview and begin pre-employment clearance to potential \nemployees over multiple intensive three-day events.  The “One Stop” events streamline the hiring process and reduce the time to hire \nlaw enforcement officers and support personnel.  Starting these “One Stop” programs in FY 2017 is expected to generate a significant \npool of applicants for ICE to hire and on-board beginning in FY 2018 as part of EO implementation.   \n \nBoth OHC and OPR intend to dedicate a significant portion of the requested resources on temporary contractor support to meet the \nDHS- 41  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 50 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \ninitial demands of the hiring and background investigations for 10,000 law enforcement officers and associated support staff. The \ncontract resources will allow ICE to complete timely hiring and on-boarding of all new employees.  \n \nFinally, ICE’s request includes $2 million to modernize its human capital information technology system to meet the demands of a \nmodern workforce and manage a large increase in applications and personnel.  In October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security \nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG) released audit findings noting that ICE lacks a comprehensive automated system to efficiently \nprocess and track law enforcement applicants. To address the OIG recommendation, ICE will acquire and implement an end-to-end \nhiring solution that will track applicants through the entire hiring process. Investment in a new human capital system will significantly \nincrease efficiencies in the hiring process, eliminate the need for the six different systems currently in place, and allow OHC to \nproduce real-time reports. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 42  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 51 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nMission Support – O&S \nPay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 43  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 52 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nMission Support – O&S \nNon Pay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 44  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 53 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nHomeland Security Investigations – O&S \n \nICE requests $15.136 million for 47 FTP and 59 FTE (12 FTE in FY 2017 and 47 FTE in FY 2018) to hire Intelligence Research \nSpecialists (IRS), which annualize in FY 2018 to support HSI investigations of cases involving terrorism, illicit smuggling and \ncontraband, child exploitation, and human trafficking in line with the priorities established by the Executive Order on Border Security \nand Immigration Enforcement Improvements (EO13767).  ICE requests that these funds be appropriated with a period of availability \nthrough September 30, 2018. \nPay: $8.602 million \nThe requested 47 IRS positions will be hired during the last quarter of FY 2017.  Statistics has identified that investigations that utilize \nIRSs are more successful than investigations that do not.  Counterpart agencies, such as DEA and FBI, have placed a greater emphasis \non the use of intelligence analysts as a force multiplier.  For example, the DEA has an intelligence analyst to Agent ratio of 1:1 and the \nFBI has an intelligence analyst to Agent of 1:6.  The current ICE ratio is 1:12.  Hiring the requested IRS positions will allow ICE to \nbuild to its eventual goal of reaching a 1:9 ratio. \nAs HSI strives to dismantle human smuggling organizations, it will deploy more intelligence analysts to support the work of agents in \nthe field, particularly those surging to the Northern Triangle.  ICE plans to increase its investigative hours dedicated to immigration-\nrelated crime by 20%.  The 47 FTP will increase the number of investigations that receive Intelligence support.  ICE will hire to \nregions that have most opportunity to benefit from additional IRS support.   \nNon-Pay: $6.534 million \nThe requested non-pay funding of $6.5 million are the general expenditures associated with on-boarding and annualizing 47 IRSs. \nThese include training, furniture, and equipment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 45  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 54 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nHomeland Security Investigations – O&S \nPay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 46  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 55 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nHomeland Security Investigations – O&S \nNon Pay by Object Class \nDollars in Thousands \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDHS- 47  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 56 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nEnforcement and Removal Operations – O&S \n \nICE requests $1.16 billion, 0 FTP, and 0 FTEs for average daily population (ADP) detention needs in response to an increase in FY \n2017 migrant apprehensions, and for an anticipated increase in apprehensions and detentions that will result from ICE implementation \nof the Administration’s immigration-related Executive Orders.  Included in this request is funding to increase the number of detention \nbeds and associate removals, and expand the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) and 287(g) programs. ICE requests that these funds be \nappropriated with a period of availability through September 30, 2018. \nPay: $0 \nAll costs associated with the request for the Enforcement and Removal Operations PPA are non-pay. \nNon-Pay: $1.16 billion  \nCustody Operations - $994.913 million \n•  ICE requests $788.8 million to support an estimated FY 2017 ADP of 42,514 (including 40,014 adults at an average daily bed \nrate of $132.54 and 2,500 families at an average daily bed rate of $319.37) stemming from increased migrant flow experienced \nin the first half of FY 2017. As of March 4, 2017, ICE ADP was 41,005 (39,007 adults and 1,998 families).    \n•  ICE requests an additional $206.1 million to begin implementation of the Executive Orders’ directive to detain all apprehended \nimmigration violators from both the border and the interior.  ICE estimates that this represents an additional ADP of 805 adults \nin FY 2017 (reaching 45,700 beds on September 30, 2017) and 3,220 adults in FY 2018.  The resulting total ADP for FY 2017 \nwill be 43,319 (40,819 adult and 2,500 family) while the FY 2018 ADP will be 54,599 (52,099 adult and 2,500 family) when \ncombined with increases requested in the FY2018 Budget. The current ADP projection is attributed to increased interior \nenforcement efforts (Criminal Alien Program, Fugitive Operations, and the expanded 287(g) program), and an increase to the \naverage length of stay (ALOS).   \n  Since their issuance, the Executive Orders have led to increases in arrests (up 50%), charging document issuance (up \n40%), and detainers (up 80%). ICE assumes that these upward trends will continue as the Executive Orders continue to \nbe implemented. \n  Forty-seven percent of ICE’s ADP is generated from interior enforcement efforts, while fifty-three percent is generated \nfrom border enforcement. The ALOS for those apprehended at the southwest is 27.4 days and 51.5 days for those \nDHS- 48  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 57 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \narrested during interior enforcement operations. \n•  There are multiple factors that will contribute to an increased ADP in FY 2017 and FY 2018.   \n  Prior years of the Secure Communities initiative provided record numbers of removals. It is expected that the \nreinstitution of this initiative outlined in the EO will result in significant increases to interior apprehensions and \nremovals. \n  In just the first six weeks since the issuance of the Executive Orders, the number of beds used to house aliens stemming \nfrom interior enforcement efforts has increased by over 2,000, representing a 12% increase and offsetting the decrease \nin the number of beds used by CBP for border enforcement. \n  Approximately 30,000 fugitive alien records will be re-enrolled in National Crime Information Center database that \npreviously fell outside of ICE’s priorities.   \n  CBP is about to enter the historical high season in which border apprehensions increase significantly due to illegal \naliens crossing the border to obtain agricultural and seasonal jobs. Border apprehensions are expected to account for X \nof the 43,319 average daily population in 2017. \n  287g participation is slated to increase by 70% with the signing of at least 26 new agreements, many in locations with \nhigh foreign-national populations.  Not only will this increase arrests from the program itself, there will be a significant \nnumber of Deportation Officers who previously worked Criminal Alien Program in these jurisdictions will be \nredeployed to other interior enforcement efforts.  \nTransportation and Removal Program (TRP) - $98.946 million \n•  TRP requires $98.9 million for transportation costs associated with the currently projected 54,599 ADP by FY 2018.  The \nadditional funding will support over 71,000 additional removals. The consistent increase in ADP requires an increase in \nresource support for TRP due to additional ground transportation movements across the network, final orders of removal by \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), expedited removal orders, and voluntary returns. \nAlternatives to Detention - $57.392 million \n•  Because of the rise in migrant flow, ATD will need supplemental funding to sustain the additional participants who will be \nmonitored on ATD. The requested $57.4 million allows ATD’s average daily participant level to reach 79,000 in FY 2017, \nwhich is 26,000 above initial estimates at the beginning of the fiscal year. As of March 6, 2017 the average FYTD participant \ncount for ATD was 69,691. \n \nDHS- 49  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 58 of 187\nCongressional Justification (Amendment)                                                                                             Department of Homeland Security \n287(g) Expansion - $5.0 million \n• \nThe Executive Orders direct the expansion of the 287(g) program.

Accordingly, FLETC’s \ncurrent operational capacity is insufficient to accommodate the training surge required to meet the requirements of the President’s \nExecutive Orders.  FLETC has identified a need for additional facilities, and will construct temporary / modular training and \nadministrative venues that will efficiently ensure capacity to deliver high quality training. \n \nTo meet the requirements of the Executive Orders, FLETC must increase capacity in several areas, including training facilities, \nhousing, and office space. In order to begin execution of the training surge in FY 2018, a portion of these facilities must be in place \nand operational.  To meet this need, FLETC requests $63M in PC&I funding to build/place 3 modular dormitories ($48.7M), modular \nclassrooms ($10.2M), and modular office space ($2M), as well as make necessary upgrades/repairs to the existing water/sewer system \n($2.1M) at FLETC’s Glynco campus, which is anticipated to be spent in FY 2018.

When this explanatory statement refers to the Committees or the Committees on \nAppropriations, these references are to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. \nThis explanatory statement refers to certain laws and organizations as follows:  the \nImplementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of2007, Public Law 110-53, is \nreferenced as the 9/11 Act; the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \nAct, Public Law 93-288, is referenced as the Stafford Act; the Department ofHomeland Security \nis referenced as DHS or the Department; the Government Accountability Office is referenced as \nGAO; and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security is referenced \nas OIG.

Appropriations related to that request are included in title VI \nof this division. \n1 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 69 of 187\nChanges to the Structure of the Bill and Report \nSince DHS was established in 2002, the 22 agencies that were consolidated into a single \ndepartment have formulated and executed their respective budgets using their legacy \nappropriation account structures and budgeting practices.  Within months of being confirmed, \nthen-Secretary Jeh Johnson announced a Unity of Effort campaign with the goal ofmaturing \nDHS into an organization that functions in a more integrated and joint fashion.  A strategie \nimperative of that campaign was to develop and institutionalize standard planning, budgeting, \nacquisition, and resourcing processes that every component would be required to follow. \nThe Department's more than 70 disparate accounts were contributing to a lack of \ntransparency and comparability among components and programs-t-and were adding unnecessary  [./'-.. \ncomplexity to spending prioritization.  To address these issues, the Department recommended  ) \nthat the existing account structure be simplified into four common account categories under \nwhich programs and activities could be funded consistently across departmental components \nbased on common assumptions and definitions.  The categories are: Operations and Support; \nProcurement, Construction, and Improvements; Research and Development; and Federal \nAssistance.  In fiscal year 2016, Congress supported the concept of common appropriations \naccounts for every component and authorized DHS to propose the fiscal year 2017 DHS budget \nin a structure that incorporated these four account types. \nIn accordance with this authority, DHS proposed the fiscal year 2017 budget request in a \ncommon format for every organization except the Coast Guard, which requires additional time to \ncoordinate the change as it also transitions to a new financial management system.  The \nappropriations account and PP A structure reflected in this Act is the culmination of that two year \neffort. \nIn addition to incorporating the new standard structure, the fiscal year 201 7 Department \nof Home land Security Appropriations bill has been re-written, updated, and streamlined.  The \nbill continues to be divided into tit l es, the first four of which contain appropriations.  Each \nappropriations paragraph begins with a lump sum appropriation, followed by any necessary \ncarve-outs of amounts for specifie activities or for multi-year availability, and concludes with \nspending limitations, when needed.  Administrative provisions specifie to a single component are \nincluded at the end of its respective title, while general provisions that pertain to multiple \ncomponents are located in title V.  This explanatory statement is organized in the same manner. \nEvery appropriating paragraph has been scrutinized and drafted to follow the Comptroller \nGeneral's Federal Princip/es ofA ppropriations Law and adheres to a core principal that the \npurpose of a lump sum appropriation is determined in the context ofthe agency's enabling and \nauthorizing legislation.  As such, appropriations paragraphs do not enumerate every statute that \nauthorizes DHS to act, in order for funding to be available for those purposes. \nLikewise, the appropriating paragraphs do not need, nor is it possible, to explicitly \nenumerate every item or activity for which the appropriation is available.  Accordingly, \npreviously enumerated activities that are considered to be part of a component' s necessary \n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 70 of 187\nexpenses are no longer expressly included.  Further, the format of the bill has been restructured \nto rn ove tho se provisions not organic to the appropriation of funds into administrative or general \nprovisions.  Certain language from prior Acts that directed policies or practices was eliminated if \nits appearance in statute is no longer required, although directives related to such policies or \npractices are in sorne cases continued through language in this statement or in the Bouse or \nSenate reports. \nDHS provided assistance in identifying instances where specificity in appropriations \nparagraphs was required for funds to be used for certain purposes.  As presented, the bill reflects \nthat careful consideration.  With regard to expired authorizations, the bill provides explicit \nextensions where so intended. \nChemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office \nThe fiscal year 2017 bud et re  uest  ro  osed the consolidation of the Office ofHealth \nAffairs  , the Domestic Nuclear Detection OfficefBNDO}', the Office ofBombing \nPrevention, and selected activities of the Science and Technology Directorate, into a new \nChemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives GftïeeÎ(CBRNE) Office.  As this \nproposed CBRNE consolidation was not authorized by Congress, the amounts appropriated for \nthese activities for fiscal year 2017 are provided to the component for which the funds were \nappropriated in prior years.  The amounts requested for CBRNE are displayed in the table at the \nend of this statement. \nClassified Programs \nRecommended adjustments to classified programs are addressed in a classified annex to \nthis explanatory statement. \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 71 of 187\nTITLE I-DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, \nINTELLIGENCE, AND OVERSIGHT \nOFFICE OF THE SECRETARY AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT \nOPERATIONS AND SUPPORT \nA total of$137,034,000 is provided for Operations and Support, including not more than \n$40,000 for official reception and representation (ORR) expenses.

First, as described in the Senate \nreport, DHS is legally obliged to submit an annual report estimating the U.S. population of \nnonimmigrant aliens who have overstayed their visas.  The Department submitted such a report \nfor fiscal year 2015, but has not yet submitted a report for fiscal year 2016.  DHS is expected to \nimprove upon the scope of the data provided in the fiscal year 2015 report in its forthcoming \nreport. \nSecond, under the headings \"Border Security Metrics\" and \"Public Reporting of \nOperational Statistics,\" the Senate report outlines congressional and public interest in border \nsecurity metrics and immigration operations data.  Recently issued executive orders also require \npublic reporting of such data, which the Department has begun to post.  For years, Congress has \ndirected DHS to develop border security metrics that quantify the operational impact of border \nsecurity investments.  Though progress has been made, DHS has still failed to produce these \nmetrics.  The Department shall brief the Committees within 90 day s of the date of enactment of \nthis Act on its plan to develop and publish the metrics described in the Senate report. \nAs directed in the Senate report, $600,000 above the request shall support qualified data \nanalysts in the Office of Immigration Statistics. \nIn addition to the Ho use directive to pro vide a comprehensive review of the number and \nlocations of all DHS personnel deployed overseas, the Office of Po licy shall identify where \nredundant staff are located and expl ain why  they are required. \nAs directed in the Senate report, the Department shall report on the deployment and \nusage of International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers and related technologies \nwithin 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act. \n5 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 73 of 187\nOffice of Partnership and Engagement \nA total of$15,206,000 is provided for the Office ofPartnership and Engagement, which \nincludes $3,514,000 for the Office ofCommunity Partnerships. \nA total of$819,000 is provided for the Blue Campaign, as requested.

These plans shaH \nbe consistent with direction provided in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law \n114-113, which required comparisons of planned and actual obligations, by PPA, of all salaries \nand benefits funding. \nAt congressional direction, DHS plans to improve the clarity and completeness of budget \njustification materials, particularly for procurement accounts.  Clarity and completeness is \nequally important for Operations and Support accounts, given the size of many of these \nappropriations and the flexibility DHS currently has to move funds among PPA  s.  Therefore, in \nfuture budget justification materials, DHS is directed to include a breakout of each account by \ncost driver, including cost drivers for any proposed programmatic changes. Additionally, the \nmaterials must clearly justify any changes in cost driver assumptions from the prior fiscal year to \nthe budget year. \nFunding provided in this Act shall be obligated in accordance with Section 2.0 of Chapter \n2 of the Department of Home land Security Financial Management Po licy Manual, dated October \n1, 2016, entitled \"DHS Appropriations Structure.\"  The Department is directed to notify the \nCommittees regarding any substantive revisions to this manual. \nOffice of the Chief Information Officer \nA total of$286,074,000 is provided for the Office ofthe Chieflnformation Officer, to \nine lude reductions of $8,002,000 based on an updated hiring projection and $2,100,000 to \nLegacy Information Technology Services. \nPROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS \nA total of$18,839,000 is provided for the Management Directorate for procurement, \nconstruction, and improvements. \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \nA total of $2,500,000 is provided for the Management Directorate for research and \ndevelopment. \n9 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 77 of 187\nINTELLIGENCE, ANALY  SIS, AND OPERAT  I ONS COORDINATION \nOPERATIONS AND SUPPORT \nA total of$263,551,000 is provided for Intelligence, Analysis, and Operations \nCoordination, ofwhich $106,115,000 is available until September 30, 2018. \nWithin the amount, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) is directed to \nimplement the Document and Media Exploitation program and to build an Analytic Innovation \nCell.

ICE is directed to brief \nthe Committees on its obligation plan for the use of these funds, as specified under title I of this \nstatement. \nICE continues to struggle with financial management across the agency.  The underlying \nproblems stem, in large part, from the limited authority and organizational placement of the ICE \nChiefFinancial Officer (CFO) position, which is subordinated to the Executive Associate \nDirectors of the operational units- Homeland Security Investigations and ERO. \nThe Director ofiCE hasan inherent fiduciary responsibility to ensure that funding \nprovided by taxpayers to the agency is executed in the most efficient and effective manner \npossible.  As the senior resource manager, the CFO has a vital role as a neutra! advisor to the \nDirector on financial management issues.  Unless the CFO reports directly to the Director, that \nindividual is not positioned to provide the Director with unfiltered financial information, provide \nadvance warning of concems, or recommend resource-conscious alternatives. In essence, this \nlack of information denies the Director full knowledge of resource issues and the ability to make \nsound decisions based on ali relevant information. The Director ofiCE is strongly urged to \nelevate the position of CFO within the organization and to expand the CFO' s responsibilities to \ninclude agency-wide resource management activities and funds control. \nFinancial management weaknesses have been a particular problem within ERO, as \ndiscussed below under the Custody Operations heading.  The lack of fiscal discipline and \ncavalier management of funding for detention operations, evidenced by inaccurate budget \nformulation and uneven execution, seems to be the result of a perception that ERO is funded by \nan indefinite appropriation.  This belief is incorrect. ICE has a duty and responsibility to the \nDepartment, the Congress, and to taxpayers to be forthright in the identification of its \nrequirements and the proper execution of its funding. It must manage-to-budget and cannot \noperate under the false perception that Congress will pro vide a bail out if financial controls fail or \nare simply ignored. \nTo begin to address these concems, a provision in this Act requires the Secretary or the \nDHS CFO to certify to the Committees on a monthly basis whether ERO is operating \nconsistently with the annual funding levels provided in this Act. The first certification will occur \nnot later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. \nAnother obstacle to sound financial management at ICE has been its approach to paying \nfor service-wide costs (SWC), such as rent, overtime, utilities, and security.  Instead ofbudgeting \ntransparent! y for these costs, ICE has historically relied on post-enactment assessments against \nthe appropriations of agency components and programs to support them.  Burying SWC in \nmission budgets makes oversight by ICE leadership and Congress significantly more difficult, \nleading to unchecked cost growth. In Custody Operations, for instance, SWC funding within the \n17 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 85 of 187\nbed rate grew by 40 percent between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 20 16; it is estimated to \nincrease by another 33 percent in fiscal year 2017. \nOMB Circular A-76 sets a standard of 12 percent as the estimated federal agency \noverhead factor.  Given that ICE also budgets for these types of costs in its Mission Support \nPPA, it is likely that the agency's overhead total significantly exceeds the OMB standard.  For \nthe fiscal year 2018 budget, ICE is directed to pro vide separate budget estimates and detailed \njustifications for SWC in appropriate Mission Support sub-PPAs or through one or more new \nSWCPPAs. \nThe amount provided for this appropriation by PP A is as follows: \nBudget Estimate  Final Bill \nOperations and Support \nHomeland Security Investigations \nDomestic Investigations  $1,892,183,000  $1,834,017,000 \nInternational Investigations  146,751,000  159,035,000 \nIntelligence  81,996,000  80,141,000 \nSubtotal, Homeland Security \nInvestigations  $2,120,930,000  $2,073,193,000 \nEnforcement and Removal Operations \nCustody Operations  $2,178,963,000  $2,557,542,000 \nFugitive Operations  133,133,000  151,795,000 \nCriminal Alien Program  347,455,000  312,350,000 \nAlternatives to Detention  125,966,000  125,883,000 \nTransportation and Removal Program  322,694,000  324,236,000 \nSubtotal, Enforcement and Removal \nOperations  $3,108,211,000  $3,471,806,000 \nMission Support  $364,489,000  $364,533,000 \nOffice of Principal Legal Adv i sor  $268,393,000  $259,000,000 \nSubtotal, Operations and Support  $5,862,023,000  $6,168,532,000 \n18 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 86 of 187\nHomeland Security Investigations \nDomestic Investigations.  A total of $1 ,834,017,000 is provided for Domestic \nInvestigations to support activities outlined in the House and Senate reports.  ICE is directed to \nmaintain increased levels of effort for ail high-priority mission areas, including overstay \nenforcement and efforts to combat human trafficking and child exploitation, as detailed in the \nstatement accompanying Public Law 114-113. \nNot less than $305,000 is to promote public awareness of the child pomography tip line \nand for activities to counter child exploitation, and not less than $15,770,000 is for investigations \nof forced labor law violations, to include forced child labor.  ICE is directed to submit an annual \nreport on expenditures and performance metrics associated with forced labor law enforcement \nactivities. \nOf the total amount provided, $10,000,000 is for continuing expanded overstay \nô \nenforcement investigations and investigative support.  ICE is èxpected to target such \ninvestigations on individuals who pose a risk to the public, and shall brief the Committees on the \nproposed use of these funds and on its overall overstay enforcement efforts, including it:s upport \nf \nofDepartment-wide activities as described in Senate Report 114-264, within 60 days of  -fV\\e_ \nenactment of this Act.  d:rk 0 \n1 \nIn addition, not less than $10,000,000 is for expanding investigations into severe forms of \nhuman trafficking and against suspected human traffickers. \nWithin the total for Domestic Investigations, $5,000,000 is provided above the request to \nfully fund ICE's implementation oflntemational Megan's Law, including the Angel Watch \nCenter.  In addition, $3,000,000 above the request is provided for enhancements at the Child \nExploitation Investigations Uni~t the Cyber Crimes Center, including $2,000,000 for the Child \nVictim Identification Section and $1,000,000 for CEIU operations. \nThe Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was launched in 2002 \nto mitigate critical vulnerabilities exploited by the 9/11 hijackers. ICE is urged to make use of \nthe full $171,000,000 in anticipated fee revenue for SEVIS, $26,000,000 more than the estimate \nincluded in the budget request, to expedite system development and dedicate additional \ninvestigative hours to ensuring that students who fail to comply with the terms of their visas face \nappropriate consequences. \nInternational Investigations.  A total of$159,035,000 is provided for International \nInvestigations, including $18,000,000 above the request for the Visa Security Program to \nannualize the costs of the previously funded pro gram expansion and for expansion to additional \nhigh priority locations. ICE is directed to use the risk-based methodologies and enforcement \nmetrics outlined in the Senate report to continue to plan and budget for Visa Security Program \nexpansion to at least two high-threat locations per year in future budget requests.  Efforts to \ncombat the smuggling and trafficking of children from Central America shall be continued in \nfiscal year 2017 at not less than the fiscal year 2016 level. \n19 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 87 of 187\nICE shaH allocate not less than $5,300,000 for war crime investigations, including but not \nlimited to training, transportation, and hiring additional personnel at the OPLA Human Rights \nLaw Section and the HSI Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Unit. \nEnforcement and Removal Operations \nA total of$3,471,806,000 is provided for Enforcement and Removal Operations. \nICE's sex offender notifications are not consistently reaching the appropriate law \nenforcement agencies, despite prior direction from the Senate to remediate this problem.  The \nagreement includes an additional $2,000,000 to enhance and augment current efforts to apprise \nlocal law enforcement agencies of offender releases.  This funding shall be used for contracts \nwith entities to notify the appropriate local law enforcement agencies in real,Âime based on an \naddress given by offenders upon their release from ICE.  Notifications should include specifie \ncrime code information so that they can be properly handled and received by the assigned \npersonnel within the local law enforcement agencies. \nCustody Operations.  A total of$2,557,542,000 is provided for Custody Operations, an \nincrease of$378,579,000 over the requested amount.  This additional funding reflects the surge \nin the number of aliens placed into remo val proceedings and detention a:fter crossing our \nsouthem border during the first quarter of fiscal year 201 7. \nEven without the increased flow of aliens into the country, ICE's fiscal year 2017 budget \nrequest negligently and knowingly used a flawed projection of the Average Daily Population \n(ADP) based on a seasonally low data point, despite knowing full well that historical trends \nsupported a higher annual detention bed requirement. Further, the daily bed rate used to calculate \nthe funding requirement for family detention was almost half of the actual rate because ICE \nassumed substantial but unrealistic savings that were not based on a validated cost estimation \nmethodology. \nFor the past severa! years, the agency's forecast for the required number of detention \nbeds and its cost estimates have resulted in budget requests that missed the mark by wide  p ( \n000 0 00 \nlJ \nmargins. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, ICE reprogrammed a combined total of$83.millioJout  > \nC().J)\nofCustody Operations because of a lower than planned ADP, only to reprogram $127-m:illion  e  Daù \n1\n~into Custody Operations in fiscal year 2016 because the estimated number ofbeds needed \nand the average daily cost used in the budget request were grossly insufficient. \nAccurately formulating the budget request for detention beds depends on two key \nvariables-the cost per bed and the number ofbeds needed, as determined by the ADP.  While \nICE has the tools to develop reliable and detailed cost estimates for detention beds, it does not \nconsistently use those tools in the formulation of the budget request.  Even with more accurate \nestimates ofbed rates, however, ICE simply has no model for estimating ADP.  While there are \nfactors beyond ICE's control that affect the size of the ADP in detention, such as the number of \napprehensions by CBP, a model better informed by historical averages and seasonal trends would \nbe a more prudent approach for forecasting the number of beds needed in the next fiscal year. \n20 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 88 of 187\nIt is apparent that additional oversight and audit work in this area is needed.  Therefore, \nthe Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to review ICE's current methodologies \nfor determining detention resource requirements, including its approach to estimating the ADP \nrequirement; evaluate ICE's efforts to improve the accuracy ofits cost estimates and projections; \nand report to the Committees within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on GAO's \nconclusions, including any appropriate recommendations. \nTo ensure costs are estimated using sound methodology, in the fiscal year 2018 \nr·· \nCongressional Budget Justification, ICE shall fully detail the methodology used to determine the \nbed rate, including the bed model output costs assumed for each ~and facility type. All  ·  -e.J..  o;,çeo... \nte.r\"\"'bi,\\j \nchanges in the various cost categories must be fully explained, rather than generally justified as \nan increase in the bed rate. The inclusion of indirect, service-wide costs into the calculation for \nbeds obscures the actual cost for detention beds and allows ICE to increase overhead costs \nwithout identifying the true nature of the increase. Therefore, ICE shall no longer include \nindirect costs in the calculation for detention beds. \nICE must also improve its contracting process for detention beds.  The agency has \napproximately 400 contracts with more than 200 detention facilities, each having varying \nservices, costs, terms, and conditions.  While contracts for detention beds are negotiated by the \nOffice of Acquisition Management (OAQ), the Field Offices notify OAQ when more beds are \nneeded and are responsible for reviewing vendor invoices for accuracy before submitting them \nfor payment.  However, there is neither a standard template for contracts nor a consistent method \n--l'th \nfor Field Offices to validate invoices. ICE is directed to brief the Committees on actions it has  1 te \nL  ;j \ntaken to improve this process not later than 30 days after)...enactment of this Act.  a \nAlso within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter, ICE \nshall pro vide an update on its oversight of adult and family detention facilities. These updates \nshall include information on the number of detention facility inspections conducted, detailed \nresults of the inspections, and the estimated costs of such reviews.  Additionally, updates on \nfamily facilities are to incorporate recommendations for improvements made by the Advisory \nCommittee on Family Residential Centers or as a result ofiCE's community liaison office. \nWithin 45 day s after the date of enactment of this Act, ICE shall report on its progress in \nimplementing the 2011 Prisee:'Based National Detention Standards, iiicluding the 2016 ievlSlons, \nand requirements related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, as detailed in the House report. \nFugitive Operations.  A total of $151,795,000 is provided for Fugitive Operations.  ICE \nis directed to continue support for Mobile Criminal Alien Teams and to target individuals who \npose a threat to the public, as described in the Senate report. \nCriminal Alien Program.  A total of$312,350,000 is provided for the Criminal Alien \nProgram, including support for 287(g) memoranda of agreement and $34,500,000 for resources \n(LESC) \n-\nand full-time law enforcement personnel at the Law Enforcement Support Cente .  As discussed \nin the Senate report, ICE shall avoid duplicating LESC activities in other parts of the country. \nWhile ICE has expanded its enforcement priorities, it is expected that the agency will continue to \n21 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 89 of 187\nemphasize the apprehension and remo val of individuals posing the greatest threat to the safety \nand security of communities. \nSection 10 of Executive Order 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior oft he \n/f('J \nUnited States, directed the Secretary t~ te.~inate t~e Priority Enf~~(;_€?~€?11! Pr~wam (PEP) and  -~---· \nreinstate the Secure CommunitiesYfogram.  The essential distinction between the two programs  ~ \nis the manner in which ICE seeks the transfer of individuals into its custody from local law \nenforcement agencies (LEA).  Under Secure Communities, ICE issues detainers to LEAs, \nrequesting that they maintain custody of individuals identified by ICE as enforcement priorit i es \nfor up to 48 hours beyond the time the individuals would otherwise be released.  Under PEP, ICE \nprimarily issued requests that law enforcement agencies notify ICE prior to when such \nindividuals would normally be released, although detainers were still issued under sorne \ncircumstances. \nIn 2016, ICE reported that PEP's notification alternative was effective in eliciting \ncooperation from mostjurisdictions that, by 2015, had stopped honoring ICE detainers.  Before \nSecure Communities was replaced by PEP, 377 jurisdictions refused to comply with sorne or ali \nICE detainers. By the end of2016, 280 ofthose jurisdictions (74 percent) had reestablished sorne \nlevel of cooperation with ICE by responding to requests for notification, honoring detainers, or \nboth, including 21 out of the largest 25 suchjurisdictions. ICE should ensure that the \nreinstatement of the Secure Communities pro gram does not undermine the progress it made \nthrough PEP in 2015 and 2016.  Specifically, ICE should continue to work with LEAs that are \nwilling to notify ICE prior to releasing individuals who are enforcement priorities.  To the extent \nthat notifications from LEAs have not always provided ICE with enough advance warning to \ntake custody of criminal aliens, ICE should continue working with LEAs to ensure that \nnotifications are made in a more timely fashion. \nWithin 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, ICE shall \npro vide a report to the Committees on the number of detention requests issued and actual \ncustody transfers to ICE by state and local law enforcement jurisdiction, criminal category, \nimmigration status, gender, country of citizenship, and enforcement priority.  ln addition, the \nreport shall detail the same information for criminal aliens released by non-participating \njurisdictions, and should describe ICE's efforts to solicit the cooperation of suchjurisdictions. \n\"1lts Gemmitt~~s l:lBèsfSofft.ftti tftat ICE is actively planning to expand participation in the \n287(g) program to severa! jurisdictions.  Astate or local law enforcement entity selected for the \nprogram receives specialized training in immigration law and other topics at the Federal Law  -\"' \nEnforcement Training Cente  and enters into a joint Memorandum of Agreement'fMOA}lwith \nICE in order to receive delegate  authority to enforce immigration laws within their \njurisdictions.  Upon arrest of a suspect, the local law enforcement partner enters identifying \ninformation into both criminal and immigration databases during booking.

TSA shall work with the air cargo industry and canine providers, as well as any \nrelevant law enforcement organizations to identify initial locations for implementing the \nprogram.  Based on lessons leamed at the initial sites, TSA shall work with stakeholders to \noutline minimum criteria for future entrance to the program.  The criteria should consider the \npotential benefits ofusing third-party canine teams in the air cargo environment.  Further, in \nassessing the right model for canine team certification, TSA shall ensure that costs to taxpayers \nare minimized and that scalability to meet industry demand is maximized.

FEMA grantees shaH continue to \nprovide reports on their use of funds, as determined necessary by the Secretary. \nFEMA preparedness grants are primarily designed to build core capabilities to address \nterrorist attacks.  Because the threat environment has become more dynamic, however, it has \ncreated a tension between sustaining current capabilities and addressing changes in the threat \nlandscape.  The FEMA risk formula, which determines the distribution of home land security \npreparedness grants, should evolve with the changing threat environment while also maintaining \ncapabilities for traditional and known threats.  While FEMA updates data points for \nincorporation, and considers comments from grantees on how the risk formula might be \nimproved, it is not clear that there is a comprehensive process for re-evaluating the risk formula \nas part of the larger strategie context.  FEMA is directed to brief the Committees not lat er than \n180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on how developing and maintaining core \ncapabilities addresses current and emerging threats; how FEMA adjusts the risk formula and \ntraining needs for emerging threats; and on innovative ways to increase responsiveness of the \nannual grant allocation process to address current threats.  _--------e._ \nUrban Area  ecurity Initiative.  Consistent with the 9/11 Act, FEMA shall conduct risk \nassessments for the 100 most populo us metropolitan statistical areas prior to making U ASI grant \nawards.  It is expected that UASI funding will be limited to urban areas representing up to 85 \npercent of the cumulative national terrorism risk to urban areas and that resources will continue \nto be allocated in proportion to risk. \nCountering Violent Extremism. The fiscal year 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act \nprovided $50,000,000, available until September 30, 2017, for emergent threats from violent \nextremism and from complex, coordinated terrorist attacks, like the 2015 incident in Paris, \nFrance.  Of this total, $10,000,000 was dedicated specifically for countering violent extremism \n(CVE) to explore ways to prevent radicalization and deter recruitment of vulnerable people who \ncould be inspired to commit acts of terror.  Although grant awards were announced in \naccordance with congressional intent on January 13, 2017, Congress has learned the grants have \nso far been withheld from obligation.  The Department is reminded of the requirements set forth \nin the Impoundment Control Act (ICA).  If the Administration is withholding this budget \nauthority from obligation-temporarily or permanently-it is required under the ICA to send a \n\"special message\" to Congress and the Comptroller General of the United States that specifies \nwhy the funds are being withheld from obligation. Importantly, funds cannot be deferred for \npolicy reasons. Given the current impasse and the currently available funds, no additional funds \nare provided for CVE grants in this Act.  The Secretary is directed to fulfill congressional intent \nby releasing the fiscal year 2016 funding without delay. \n49 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 22-7   Filed 12/12/17   Page 117 of 187\nFlood Hazard Mapping and RiskAnalysis.

Once again, the budget request included a \nprovision allowing the FEMA Administrator to transfer EFSP to the Department ofHousing and \nUrban Development (HUD).  While this proposai may have merit, Congress and other \nstakeholders have not been properly consulted in developing support for such a transfer.  If \nfuture budget requests again propose moving EFSP to HUD, they should do so directly within \nthe HUD budget, including the justification for moving the program; a plan for funds transfer, \nfiv~.,fear-strat~~;tiookf~~the··~-={G \nincluding previously obligated amounts and recoveries; a \nprogram within HUD; a timeline for an interagency agreement effecting the transfer; and a \ndescription of efforts to consult with the EFSP National Board on the proposed move. \nEducation, Training, and Exercises \nA total of $273,927,000 is provided for Education, Training, and Exercises.

When the Department submits a reprograrnming or transfer notification and \ndoes not receive identical responses from the House and Senate Committees, it is expected to \nreconcile the differences before proceeding. \nThe Department is not to submit a reprograrnming or transfer notification after June 30 \nexcept in extraordinary circumstances that imminently threaten the safety ofhuman life or the \nprotection of property.  If an above-threshold reprograrnming or a transfer is needed after June \n30, the notice should contain sufficient documentation asto why it meets this statutory \nexception. \nThe section 503(a)(5) limitation on reprograrnming funds for the purpose ofreorganizing \ncomponents is not intended to apply to routine or small reallocations of personnel or fun etions \nwithin components.

FOIA is not a search mechanism.  Records must\nbe described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to\nlocate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, §5.3(b) of the DHS regulations,\n6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that\nour search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific\ninformation about each record sought, such as the event that would have created the record, a date range for the request,\nand subject matter of the records. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed\nby requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \nPlease narrow the scope of your request, a search for records responsive to your request in it's present state could\npotentially return a massive amount of documents which would create an reasonable burden on the agency.  Additionally,\nplease provide a time frame for items 4 through 8 of your request.\nThis is not a denial of your request for records.

Sierra Club brings this case under the Freedom of Information Act to \n4  obtain timely disclosure of agency documents regarding the Trump \n5  Administration’s controversial plans to expand or replace the border wall along the \n6  United States-Mexico border.   \n7  2.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order, \n8  entitled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” directing \n9  the Secretary of Homeland Security to vastly expand the existing walls along the \n10  roughly 1,900-mile southern border that spans California, Arizona, New Mexico, \n11  and Texas. On February 20, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security \n12  accordingly directed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to  \n13  immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, \nincluding the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as \n14  patrol and access roads, along the land border with Mexico in accordance \nwith existing law, in the most appropriate locations and utilizing appropriate \n15  materials and technology to most effectively achieve operational control of \nthe border.  \n16  The Department further directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to \n17  “immediately identify and allocate all sources of available funding” for the \n18  planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining of the border wall. \n19  3.  Sierra Club is concerned about and seeks documentation of the \n20  potential environmental impacts associated with border wall planning, construction \n21 \n22 \n  Page 2 of 19 \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 3 of 19\n \n1  and operation. For example, the Secretary of Homeland Security invoked a \n2  statutory waiver to exempt border wall construction during the George W. Bush \n3  administration. The act of waiving federal statutes like the Clean Water Act, \n4  Endangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act put wildlife and \n5  the public health of local communities at risk. Habitat set aside for endangered \n6  species, including the ocelot, jaguar, and Sonoran pronghorn, has been fragmented \n7  and will be damaged even further by building new wall segments.  \n8  4.  The human cost of new walls would also be immense, dividing border \n9  communities, destroying private land, impeding water flow, harming human \n10  health, and causing unnecessary deaths.   \n11  5.   The Trump Administration has called for $1.7 billion in development \n12  funds for 60 miles of new border wall construction in fiscal year 2017, and $2.8 \n13  billion in fiscal year 2018. If built, the new walls would bifurcate the Santa Ana \n14  National Wildlife Refuge in the southern tip of Texas, and harm other sensitive \n15  areas along the border. The Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat \n16  for a diverse of array of rare wildlife species, including the ocelot, an endangered \n17  cat of which there are only about 50 remaining in the United States. Expanded \n18  walls and related infrastructure also threatens to undermine the tourist economy of \n19  the surrounding communities. \n20  6.  Sierra Club is the nation’s oldest grassroots environmental \n21 \n22 \n  Page 3 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 4 of 19\n \n1  organization, and has long advocated to protect and preserve the cultures of the \n2  borderland communities, as well as the region’s land, wildlife, and environment. \n3  As part of this advocacy, and in line with its longstanding interest in government \n4  accountability and transparency, the Sierra Club has filed several requests under \n5  the Freedom of Information Act with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to \n6  obtain documents regarding plans to expand or replace the border wall along the \n7  U.S.-Mexico border. The Sierra Club’s Borderlands Grassroots Network Team has \n8  been organizing around border issues for many years, and its advocacy has become \n9  more urgent in light of President Trump’s recent activities. \n10  7.  The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border \n11  Protection (the Agencies) have violated the Freedom of Information Act by failing \n12  to make a “determination,” and failing to produce any documents in response to \n13  Sierra Club’s 2016 and 2017 record requests, and a 2013 Sierra Club request that \n14  was remanded back to the Agencies after Sierra Club successfully appealed the \n15  final determination. \n16  8.  The Agencies have also violated the Freedom of Information Act by \n17  failing to conduct an adequate search for records and wrongfully withholding \n18  records. \n19  9.  Sierra Club brings this lawsuit to hold the Agencies accountable under \n20  the law and respectfully requests that the Court order the Agencies to expeditiously \n21 \n22 \n  Page 4 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 5 of 19\n \n1  produce all non-exempt documents responsive to Sierra Club’s records requests.   \n2  10.  Timely disclosure is imperative. The controversial border wall is a \n3  matter of significant public interest and concern; yet, in secret, the Agencies are \n4  actively planning, designing, and preparing for construction and maintenance of \n5  the wall. Given the significant threat the wall poses to communities and the \n6  environment, the public must have timely information about the Trump \n7  Administration’s plans, including the potential impacts on communities, lands, and \n8  wildlife.  \n9  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n10  11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 \n11  U.S.C. § 1331. \n12  12.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) \n13  because Plaintiff Sierra Club has its principal place of business in Oakland, \n14  California.  \n15  13.  For the same reason, intradistrict assignment is proper in the Oakland \n16  Division. See N.D. Cal. L.R. 3-2.  \n17  PARTIES \n18  14.  Plaintiff Sierra Club is incorporated in the State of California as a \n19  nonprofit public benefit corporation with headquarters in Oakland, California. The \n20  Sierra Club is a national organization with 67 chapters and more than 825,000 \n21 \n22 \n  Page 5 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 6 of 19\n \n1  members dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the \n2  earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth’s ecosystems \n3  and resources; to educating and enlisting humanity to protect and restore the \n4  quality of the natural and human environment; and to using all lawful means to \n5  carry out these objectives. Sierra Club is a leading non-governmental organization \n6  seeking to educate and mobilize the public on issues of climate change, habitat \n7  destruction, and the myriad of human and environmental impacts of the Trump \n8  Administration’s proposed Border Wall. Sierra Club’s Borderlands Grassroots \n9  Network Team has been organizing around border issues for many years. To \n10  support the Borderlands Team’s efforts and to further Sierra Club’s longstanding \n11  interest in government accountability and transparency, Sierra Club submitted the \n12  records requests at issue in this case. \n13  15.  Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its \n14  members. Sierra Club and its members have been and continue to be injured by the \n15  Agencies’ failure to provide requested records on matters of great public interest \n16  and urgency within the timeframes mandated by the Freedom of Information Act. \n17  Absent this critical information, Sierra Club cannot advance its mission to educate \n18  the public about the proposed expansion of the border wall and its impacts on \n19  communities and the environment. The requested relief will redress this injury. \n20  16.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a department of \n21 \n22 \n  Page 6 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 7 of 19\n \n1  the executive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., \n2  and an agency of the federal government within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n3  § 552(f)(1). It has in its possession and control the records sought by Sierra Club, \n4  and as such, is subject to FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n5  17.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is an agency \n6  within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and is also headquartered in \n7  Washington, D.C. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has possession, custody, \n8  and control of the records that Sierra Club seeks. \n9  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n10  18.  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to \n11  promptly release to a public requester, documents and records within the \n12  possession of the agency, unless a statutory exemption applies. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)–\n13  (b). \n14  19.  Agencies must make reasonable efforts to search for records in a \n15  manner that is reasonably calculated to locate all records that are responsive to the \n16  FOIA request. Id. § 552(a)(3)(C)–(D). \n17  20.  The agency must make a determination whether to disclose records \n18  within twenty business days of an agency’s receipt of a FOIA request. Id. \n19  § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  \n20  21.  If an agency determines that it will comply with the request, it must \n21 \n22 \n  Page 7 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 8 of 19\n \n1  “promptly” release responsive, non-exempt records to the requester. Id. \n2  § 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  \n3  22.  The Act recognizes that in certain, limited instances, records may be \n4  withheld as exempt from FOIA’s broad disclosure mandate, and thus the Act \n5  identifies nine categories of exemptions. Id. § 552(b).  \n6  23.  FOIA places the burden on the agency to prove that it may withhold \n7  responsive records from a requester. Id. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n8  24.  If an agency makes a final determination to withhold or partially \n9  withhold documents, the requester is entitled to appeal the adverse decision to the \n10  agency within a period of time “that is not less than 90 days after the date after \n11  such adverse determination.” Id. § (a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa). \n12  25.  An agency must make a determination on any appeal within twenty \n13  business days of receipt. Id. § (a)(6)(A)(ii) \n14  26.  If the agency fails to comply with the statutory time limits to respond \n15  to a FOIA request or appeal, the requester is deemed to have exhausted her \n16  administrative remedies. Id. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  \n17  27.  District courts have jurisdiction to enjoin an agency from withholding \n18  agency records and “order the production of any agency records improperly \n19  withheld.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(B).  \n20  28.  The Freedom of Information Act provides a mechanism for \n21 \n22 \n  Page 8 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 9 of 19\n \n1  disciplinary action against agency officials who have inappropriately withheld \n2  records. Specifically, when requiring the release of improperly withheld records, if \n3  the Court makes a written finding that “the circumstances surrounding the \n4  withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or \n5  capriciously,” a disciplinary investigation is triggered. Id. § 552(a)(4)(F)(i). \n6  FACTS \n7  Sierra Club’s 2013 FOIA Request for Border Wall Documents and Appeal \n8  29.  On April 17, 2013, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to U.S. \n9  Customs and Border Protection seeking access to the following records: \n10  The Sierra Club requests records dating from January 1, 2010 to the present \npertaining to the construction of border fencing (also commonly referred to \nas the border wall, pedestrian fence, and tactical infrastructure) in the \n11  vicinity of the communities of Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos, \nTexas.  These sections of border fencing will be built in the Border Patrol’s \nRio Grande Valley sector have been designated O-1, O-2, and O-3.  Very \n12 \nlittle information has been released to the public regarding these sections of \nborder fencing, despite a great deal of local public interest.  The Sierra Club \nis particularly interested in the impact of these fencing sections on the Lower \n13 \nRio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the potential for the \nimpedance of flood waters that may accompany the erection of fencing in \n14  the Rio Grande flood plain. \n \nResponsive documents should include (but not be limited to) internal CBP \n15 \ndiscussions, memos, meeting notes, presentation materials such as \nPowerpoints and handouts, and reports regarding fencing sections O-1, O-2, \nand O-3.  Any contracts that have been prepared and/or put out for bid \n16 \nand/or granted for these sections should be included.  Documents should \nalso include consultations, interactions, and discussions with the Army \n17  Corps. of Engineers, the International Boundary Water Commission, US \nFish and Wildlife, the State Department, and local government officials and \nresidents regarding these fencing sections.     \n18 \n \nSee Exhibit A. \n19 \n30.  Customs and Border Protection assigned Sierra Club’s request with \n20 \ntracking number CBP-2013-016845.  \n21 \n22 \n  Page 9 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 10 of 19\n \n1  31.  On September 4, 2015, Customs and Border Protection’s FOIA \n2  Division stated that CBP-2013-016845 was currently being processed.  \n3  32.  After repeated requests for updates by Sierra Club, in January 2016, \n4  the FOIA request CBP-2013-016845 disappeared from the online queue at \n5  FOIAonline, a federal website dedicated to processing FOIA requests. \n6  33.  On January 29, 2016, a new tracking number appeared in Sierra \n7  Club’s online queue, CBP-2016-018165, corresponding to the same April 17, 2013 \n8  FOIA request.  \n9  34.  On December 9, 2016, Customs and Border Protection determined \n10  that the requested documents were partially releasable, and asserted that FOIA \n11  exemptions (b)(4) and (b)(5) applied to Sierra Club’s request. \n12  35.  Also on December 9, 2016, Customs and Border Protection provided \n13  Sierra Club with 10 documents, but those documents were redacted almost in their \n14  entirety. See Exhibit B. \n15  36.  On February 3, 2017, Sierra Club filed a timely administrative appeal \n16  to Custom and Border Protection’s determination on CBP-2013-016845/CBP-\n17  2016-018165. See Exhibit C. \n18  37.  On March 16, 2017, Customs and Border Protection’s Chief of the \n19  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, replied to Sierra Club’s February 3, \n20  2017 appeal of the 2013 FOIA request in part with: \n21 \n22 \n  Page 10 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 11 of 19\n \n1  In this case, the FOIA Division released certain redacted documents to you \nbut it does not appear as if the FOIA Division searched for a number of other \n2  agency records you identified in your appeal.  In this respect, your appeal \nspecifically identifies various reports, presentations, plans, and other \n3  documents that were requested in your initial FOIA submission.   However, \nas it appears as if the FOIA Division did not search for these records, there is \n4  an incomplete administrative record for us to review on appeal in this case. \n \n5  Accordingly, we are remanding your request to the FOIA Division for \nprocessing with instructions that the request should be processed within \n6  twenty (20) days from the date of this letter. . . . As mentioned above, you \nmay immediately challenge the FOIA Division’s failure to respond to your \n7  request in district court. \n \n8  See Exhibit D. \n9  38.  On April 14, 2017, Customs and Border Protection stated: \n10  Please be advised this case has been remanded to the FOIA Division to \ncomplete additional searches for responsive records. An additional 30 \n11  business days from the date of this letter are needed for the program office to \ncomplete a comprehensive search of records.  Once the searches have been \n12  completed, you will receive additional correspondence with a projected time \nframe for the completion of the remand. \n13   \nSee Exhibit E. \n14 \n15  39.  As of the date of this filing, the Agencies have not made any further \n16  determination on Sierra Club’s 2013 request or released any additional documents. \n17  Sierra Club’s 2016 FOIA Requests for Border Wall Documents  \n18  40.  On November 19, 2016, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to \n19  Customs and Border Protection seeking access to the following: \nThe Sierra Club trying to understand the scope of work that LMI (the \n20 \nLogistics Management Institute) did for Customs and Border Protection \nregarding border fencing and related tactical infrastructure.  According to \n21 \n22 \n  Page 11 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 12 of 19\n \nLMI’s website this work was quite expansive, and LMI and its employees \n1 \nrepeatedly pop up in FOIA documents that we have received from CBP and \nother agencies.  LMI employees appear to have played an important role in \n2  the Secure Border Initiative Program Management Office.  We have \nreceived some SBI PMO meeting minutes from 2007 and 2008 that indicate \nthat meetings were held at LMI's McLean, Virginia office.   \n3 \n \nThe Sierra Club specifically seeks documents, including SBI PMO and other \nmeeting minutes and notes, as well as emails, memos, and reports, that \n4 \ninvolve and/or relate to the participation of LMI employees in the Secure \nBorder Initiative Program Management Office, and meetings at LMI's \n5  McLean, Virginia office from January 2006 through the present. \n \nPlease include emails, letters, call logs, and other communications regarding \n6 \nthese meetings.  Customs and Border Protection discussions, reports, \nupdates, presentation materials such as Powerpoints, etc., that pertain to \nthese meetings should be included.   \n7 \n \nSee Exhibit F. \n8 \n41.  Customs and Border Protection assigned the request tracking number \n9 \nCBP-2017-011338.   \n10 \n42.  The Agencies have not made any further determination on Sierra \n11 \nClub’s 2016 request, CBP-2017-011338, and have not released any documents. \n12 \n13  Sierra Club’s 2017 FOIA Request for Border Wall Documents  \n43.  On May 4, 2017, Sierra Club submitted a FOIA request to Customs \n14 \nand Border Protection seeking access to the following: \n15 \n1.  All records related to the Border Wall referred to on p. 32 of the \n16 \nAdministration’s FY 2017 supplemental appropriations request (see \nExhibit A), including, but not limited to: \n17 \na.  the 14 miles of new Border Wall and 14 miles of replacement \nBorder Wall near San Diego, CA; and \n18 \nb.  the 28 miles of levee-Border Wall in the Rio Grande Valley \nSector; and  \n19 \nc.  the 6 miles of new Border Wall proposed in South Texas, \nhereinafter (“Border Wall Proposals”). \n20 \n2.  All maps and related documents that identify all locations considered or \n21 \n22 \n  Page 12 of 19   \n  COMPLAINT \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05273-KAW   Document 1   Filed 09/12/17   Page 13 of 19\n \n1  planned for border fencing/tactical infrastructure described in the FY \n2017 Appropriations legislation passed in May 2017 (see Exhibit B, p. \n2  69), including but not limited to: \na.  Replacement of primary pedestrian fencing in high priority areas - \n3  20 miles; and \nb.  Replacement of vehicle fencing with primary pedestrian fencing in \n4  high priority areas - 20 miles; and  \na.  Gates for existing barriers- 35 gates. \n5  3.  All bids submitted by vendors to Customs and Border Protection \n(“CBP”) and/or the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) related \n6  to the Border Wall Proposals; and \n4.  All communications between CBP and/or DHS and vendors related to \n7  Border Wall Proposals; and \n5.  All communications between CBP and DHS related to the Border Wall \n8  Proposals, including, but not limited to: funding, timetables, and vendor \nselection; and \n9  6.  All existing and/or proposed timetables for the execution and \nconstruction of the Border Wall Proposals; and \n10  7.  All communications between CBP and/or the DHS with the White House \nthat relate to the Border Wall Proposals; and \n11  8.  All communication between CBP and/or DHS and any other Federal \nAgencies that relate to the Border Wall Proposals. \n12   \nSee Exhibit G. \n13 \n14  44.  Customs and Border Protection assigned the request tracking number \n15  CBP-2017-054695.  \n16  45.  On August 11, 2017, three months after Sierra Club’s initial request, \n17  Customs and Border Protection sent Sierra Club a letter notifying it that the \n18  average time to process a request related to “travel/border incidents” was a \n19  minimum of 3 to 6 months.  \n20  46.

This Task Order will include preparation of 100% Design Documents\nresulting in a complete and usable project. All work shall conform to the CBP design criteria.\nThe A-E Contractor will coordinate these items with the CESWF Project Design Team, CBP \npersonnel, and local utility providers. Overall guidance is provided by the CBP and TI Design \nGuides. See the CESWF AEIM for design deliverable requirements.\nThe Geotechnical Investigation and design requirements will be provided by the A-E. \nThe Topographic Survey will be provided by the A-E. \nThe Value Engineering Study will be provided by the A-E using a third-party firm. \nThe Construction Cost Estimate/Current Working Estimate will be provided by the A-E. One \nconstruction contract will be prepared for this project.\nA pre-proposal conference to finalize the project scope of work and aid in the preparation of the A-\nE proposal is recommended. Labor and travel costs are not reimbursed by the Government.\nSeparate A-E fee proposals are required for each funded project. Fees must be clearly delineated \nbetween design and non-design. \n2.1.1   Base Product Scope \nThe A-E shall develop design documents for construction for 2.93 miles of floodwall (also \nreferenced as “levee wall”) along with supportive components (i.e., Fiber Optic Distributed \nSensing, all-weather road(s), surveillance system, lighting, communications towers, the 150’ \nswath) comprising an enforcement system is critical to RGV Sector’s ability to prevent illegal \nentries (whether people, narcotics, etc.) and to achieve operational control of the border \ncommensurate with Executive Order 13767.  This will be at Weslaco Station’s Zone 11. The \nproject alignment map can be found in Appendix 01 and will be on the south toe of the U.S. IBWC\nlevee along the Maintenance Road.\nThe enforcement zone will be comprised of an engineered system of critical enforcement \ncomponents that include the wall, lights, video surveillance system, Fiber Optic Distributed \nSensing, vegetation control and an all-weather road (to facilitate proactive and concentrated patrol \nefforts).  This system of capabilities will be arranged within a ~150’-wide footprint as measured \nfrom the southern toe of the levee to ~150’ south of that point.  The ~150’-wide swath of real-\nestate will run concurrently with and parallel to the wall throughout the project area.  The resulting\nenforcement zone will facilitate the establishment of a preventative operational profile; which, in \nturn, creates and conveys to the adversary an immediate certainty of detection and apprehension \nfor any attempted breach.  \nSubmittals will include survey and drainage features. The A-E will need to assess conditions of \nexisting drainage and water crossings. In addition, the A-E shall define performance requirements \n4\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nfor construction to include but not limited to, welding, length, condition, wall thickness. The \nrequirements will ensure the fence is not structurally compromised when it is being transitioned \nfrom a horizontal position to the final vertical placement. The A-E must incorporate design review \ncomments from USACE, CBP, USBP, and International Boundary and Water Commission \n(IBWC).\nThe project will be awarded as a Design-Bid-Build construction project under an existing \nunrestricted horizontal MATOC at USACE. The design and completed construction must be \napproved and certified by FEMA according to their standards for flood protection.  FEMA \ncoordination will be an independent approval from IBWC, but will have similar effort to the \nIBWC approval.  This will be a separate hydraulic model than the IBWC model.\nThe A-E will define top elevation for the fence at each water crossing, so that the top of the fence \ncan be viewed from the video surveillance systems.\nThe design is required to include Remote Video Surveillance Towers (RVSS) towers every 2.0 \nmiles (2 towers for the design).  A map of the proposed alignment is included in Appendix A. Mile\n0 to 2.93 starts on west end of RGV-010 and moves east.\nFloodwall (i.e. Levee Wall):\nThe wall will be a concrete wall to the design height of the existing earthen levee crest will include\na design for 18 ft. tall bollards installed in the top of the levee wall. The floodwall’s alignment \nshould be integrated into the existing levee embankment’s cross section.  The existing levees are \nnot certified by FEMA. The A-E will work with IBWC and FEMA to obtain FEMA certification \nand/or to ensure that the levee/wall meets all design criteria for FEMA certification.  For FEMA \ncertification, any deficient areas along the existing levee embankment will need to be repaired in \nconjunction of floodwall construction since the wall and adjoining levee acts as one structure.  The\nlevee floodwall will include automated vehicle gates for access south of the levee wall. The \nnumber, size and location of the gates will be determined during the design phase. Floodwalls and \nassociated components shall be design for hydraulic loading, seepage, and slope stability.  \nFiber Optic Distributed Sensing:\nA fiber optics cable associated with the Fiber Optic Distributed Sensing (FODS) system will be \ninstalled in the enforcement zone. Its connection with the required electronics to make it \noperational will be subject of a future project. Any work included in this SOW shall anticipate and \nfacilitate that future connection.\nThe design will include in-placing fiber optic cable for the entire length of the project, 18” - 24” \ndeep, in proximity and parallel to the fence. The cable shall be in conduit and embedded in \nconcrete at all water crossings. The design shall include drawings detailing how this work will be \naccomplished. The A/E shall design to prevent washouts and include any additional design \nelements required for other structures.\nLighting:\n5\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nEnforcement zone LED lighting will be installed as part of this project. Ideally the light fixtures \nwill be mounted on poles located within the approximate center of the enforcement zone but \ncompliance with floodplain restrictions may dictate that they be mounted on the levee wall or \nbollards. The lights will be designed and constructed in accordance with the lighting design \nstandards developed and confirmed as part of the San Luis lighting retrofit project recently \ncompleted in Yuma, AZ. The lights will be made fully functional as part of the construction \nproject, to include the supply of power to the site if not available. The lights shall illuminate the \nentire enforcement zone and the southern face of the levee wall with the intent of minimizing any \ndead zones to the extent feasible.\nAll Weather Road:\nAn all-weather aggregate patrol road (type FC-2) will be constructed on the south side and parallel\nto the levee wall and within the 150 ft enforcement zone and floodplain. The specific location of \nthe road within the enforcement zone will be determined during the design phase of the project. \nVegetation removal within the enforcement zone will be included with this task and be covered \nunder an environmental waiver provided by the Government. The floodwall and its earthen \nembankment crest shall be designed to accommodate vehicle loading.  IBWC & USBP shall \nprovide traffic loading conditions.\nValue Engineering: The primary objective for the Value Engineering Contractor (VEC) is to \nconduct a VE Studies focused on the review of the latest design packages to ensure requirements \nand technical parameters are clearly defined. In addition, the VEC shall evaluate available project \ninformation to enhance the value of the project through the identification of appropriate cost \nsaving measures, including life cycle cost savings, and added value improvements without \nsacrificing project requirements.\nConstruction Project Phasing: \nDue to funding constraints, the Construction Documents will be developed to include a base bid \nand five options for construction.  The Construction Base Bid and Options will be developed as \nfollows:\nConstruction CLIN\nSchedule Length in Miles\nBase Bid 1.0\nOption 1 0.5\nOption 2 0.5\nOption 3 0.5\nOption 4 0.13\nOption 5 0.3\nTOTAL Miles 2.93\n2.1.2   Base Project Scope\n6\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\n2.1.2.1   This Scope of Work includes all work necessary for the A-E firm to prepare 100% Design\ndocuments denoting a complete and usable facility.\na.

This data shall include the seamless \n30-meter elevation datasets, current aerial imagery, and the new survey data being \ncollected for the project.  The U.S. - Mexico Border Environmental Health Initiative \n(BEHI) created a seamless 30-meter elevation dataset for both sides of the border.  The 30 \nmeter 1 arc second USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) was harmonized with the \nInstituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (INEGI) 30 meter Continuo de \nElevaciones Mexicano (CEM) to create a seamless elevation model for the U.S.-Mexico \n9\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nBorder region.  In addition the USGS applied the NED filtering and smoothing algorithms \nto INEGI′s CEM to improve the dataset. Other geospatial data to be collected may include \ncities, urban areas, roads, watersheds, streams and rivers, and land cover.  Most of the \nrequired geospatial data, including the seamless 30-meter elevation data, is available for \ndownload from the U.S. - Mexico BEHI website (BEHI, 2015).\nThe Contractor shall address the following requirements for the programmatic drainage \nreport and the RGV-010 project hydrologic analyses:\nProvide final drainage basin delineation maps showing all basins and sub-basins \nassociated with the limits of construction. The contractor shall determine all locations \nwhere existing intermittent streams, rivers, or drainage paths cross the proposed project \nwhose drainage areas are distinguishable in the 30-meter elevation data.  For each \ndrainage crossing location, the contractor shall delineate the contributing drainage area \nusing seamless 30 m U.S. NED and Mexico CEM elevation data.\nFor each drainage crossing location, peak discharges shall be calculated for the \nwatershed runoff hydrographs resulting from the 25-yr, 50-yr and 100-yr storm events.  \nThe methodology for calculating hydrologic flows at the project drainage crossings shall\nuse the following three methods as minimum design standards:\na) For watersheds less than 1 square mile, the rational method can be used.  This\nmethod is not applicable to larger drainage areas.  \nb) For watersheds between 1 square mile and 10 square miles, the Natural\nResources Conservation Service method shall be used.\nc) For watersheds larger than 10 square miles, the regression equations for the\narea shall be used. These equations are provided by the U. S. Geological\nSurvey’s (USGS) GLSNet software. \nMore detailed rainfall-runoff modeling in HEC-HMS may be substituted for any of the \nabove minimum design methods.  Since all of the above methods carry a great degree of\nuncertainty, the contractor shall calculate the 25-yr, 50-yr and 100-yr peak discharges \nwith two or more of the four methods listed above and then adopt the maximum value \nfor design.    This approach is intended to improve the long term reliability of the \ndrainage design.\nUSIBWC is responsible for ensuring that improvements on the U.S. side of the\ninternational land border with Mexico comply with treaty provisions as they relate to\ncross-border drainage. Impact to water surface elevation between the pre and post\nconstruction conditions due to any new TI, including border and access roads, being built\nalong the land border between the U.S. and Mexico shall not exceed 6 inches in rural areas\nand 3 inches in urban areas using the 100-year storm event as required by USIBWC. \nTo verify the impacts are within the above mentioned limits, hydraulic models shall be \ndeveloped. The models shall be developed with HEC-RAS software using the 100-yr \ndischarges calculated in the hydrologic analyses of this scope.    Existing conditions and \nproposed conditions models shall be developed at each applicable drainage crossing, and \n10\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nthe difference in water surface elevations shall be compared. The existing conditions cross \nsections shall be cut from the project survey data in the immediate area of the proposed \nproject and from the 30-meter elevation data outside of the survey area.  The proposed \ncondition models shall demonstrate that the impacts of proposed structures to be built \nwithin the floodplains of these drainage paths will not exceed the rise in water surface \nelevation limits stated above.  New construction or improvements more than 60 feet north \nof the border do not need to comply with the drainage treaty provisions mentioned above.\nThe Contractor shall address the following requirements for hydraulic analyses:\nDetermine local drainage runoff and/or sheet flow conditions as they cross the fence \nalignment.\nProvide the final hydraulic calculations identifying the final discharge velocity and rise \nin water surface elevation associated with the selected fence type at each identified wash\ncrossing.

Contact CESWF-EC-AC Section Chief for information \npertaining to obtaining the software. Each submittal must include an MII estimate based upon \nthe current stage of design. The software database now requires purchase (with the costs \nsubject to change), but current cost is approximately $1,000.  This purchase is not made nor \ncontrolled through CESWF-EC-AC.  The current version of the software program will be \nprovided to the A-E under contract who must then follow the prescribed licensing procedure to\nmake use of the software for the term of this contract.  Any other use of the software and the \ndatabase can be utilized per the terms of the licensing agreement with the manufacturer.  That \nlicensing agreement is not under the control of CESWF-EC-AC.  A PDF file of the project \nestimate must be submitted with the reports file. Hard copy requirements are denoted \nelsewhere. The estimate will not be complete until the bid opening estimate or final proposal \nestimate which includes all amendments and the completed bid or CLIN schedule in its final \nadvertised format have been submitted to CESWF prior to the construction contractors’ final \nproposal or bid deadline date shown in the solicitation or SF30. All pricing information \nincluded with any database or other source can and should be adapted, modified, changed, \nincreased, or decreased as deemed necessary by the estimator to prepare an estimate \nrepresentative of the project.  The information contained in any database or any other cost \ninformation provided by the Fort Worth District office, CESWF-EC-AC, or obtained from \nother sources is not intended to represent fixed prices for ordering supplies, equipment, \nmaterial, labor, nor any other construction component in the Government estimate.  The \nestimator's professional judgment and decisions should be the definitive factor in determining \nfair and reasonable costs calculated for submittals and reviews.  In MII, when submitting \nestimates for Military Projects, the Corps' current 20 system Work Breakdown Structure \n(WBS) will be used to structure the estimate (or PCCost 3086/1391 format when requested) \nunless CESWF-EC-AC determines that WBS is not applicable.  For Civil Works Projects, the \ncurrent Code of Accounts structure will be used unless the project is of a nature that does not \nwarrant any of these estimate structures but that variance must be requested and then \nauthorized by CESWF-EC-AC. Excel based estimates or other software forms of estimating \nare not acceptable unless the A-E has been approved by CESWF-EC-AC to provide back-up \ndata or lower level costs in those formats.  Final roll-up and mark-ups of those estimates will \nbe entered in MII software for submittals though by utilizing the structure required by \nCESWF-EC-AC. The A-E shall be aware of and take precautionary measures as necessary to \nmaintain the confidential nature of all cost estimates prepared under this Task Order.  All \nestimate submittals shall be prepared in accordance with USACE instructions, regulations, and\nmanuals for cost estimates as contained in EI 01D010, ER 1110-2-1302, and TM 5-800-4 and \nin compliance with EFARS 36.2.

General drainage design criteria shall be used for sizing erosion\nprotection and conveyance measures along with treaty requirements from the U.S. Section\nof the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) as discussed in the TI\ndesign standards.  \nThe contractor shall be responsible for gathering all geospatial and hydrologic data \nnecessary for the hydrologic and hydraulic analyses.  This data shall include the seamless \n30-meter elevation datasets, current aerial imagery, and the new survey data being \ncollected for the project.  The U.S. - Mexico Border Environmental Health Initiative \n(BEHI) created a seamless 30-meter elevation dataset for both sides of the border.  The 30 \nmeter 1 arc second USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) was harmonized with the \n34\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nInstituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (INEGI) 30 meter Continuo de \nElevaciones Mexicano (CEM) to create a seamless elevation model for the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder region.  In addition the USGS applied the NED filtering and smoothing algorithms \nto INEGI′s CEM to improve the dataset. Other geospatial data to be collected may include \ncities, urban areas, roads, watersheds, streams and rivers, and land cover.  Most of the \nrequired geospatial data, including the seamless 30-meter elevation data, is available for \ndownload from the U.S. - Mexico BEHI website (BEHI, 2015).\nThe Contractor shall address the following requirements for hydrologic analyses:\nProvide final drainage basin delineation maps showing all basins and sub-basins \nassociated with the limits of construction. The contractor shall determine all locations \nwhere existing intermittent streams, rivers, or drainage paths cross the proposed project \nwhose drainage areas are distinguishable in the 30-meter elevation data.  For each \ndrainage crossing location, the contractor shall delineate the contributing drainage area \nusing seamless 30 m U.S. NED and Mexico CEM elevation data.\nFor each drainage crossing location, peak discharges shall be calculated for the \nwatershed runoff hydrographs resulting from the 25-yr, 50-yr and 100-yr storm events.  \nThe methodology for calculating hydrologic flows at the project drainage crossings shall\nuse the following three methods as minimum design standards:\na) For watersheds less than 1 square mile, the rational method can be used.  This\nmethod is not applicable to larger drainage areas.  \nb) For watersheds between 1 square mile and 10 square miles, the Natural\nResources Conservation Service method shall be used.\nc) For watersheds larger than 10 square miles, the regression equations for the\narea shall be used. These equations are provided by the U. S. Geological\nSurvey’s (USGS) GLSNet software. \nMore detailed rainfall-runoff modeling in HEC-HMS may be substituted for any of the \nabove minimum design methods.  Since all of the above methods carry a great degree of\nuncertainty, the contractor shall calculate the 25-yr, 50-yr and 100-yr peak discharges \nwith two or more of the four methods listed above and then adopt the maximum value \nfor design.    This approach is intended to improve the long term reliability of the \ndrainage design.\nUSIBWC is responsible for ensuring that improvements on the U.S. side of the\ninternational land border with Mexico comply with treaty provisions as they relate to\ncross-border drainage. Impact to water surface elevation between the pre and post\nconstruction conditions due to any new TI, including border and access roads, being built\nalong the land border between the U.S. and Mexico shall not exceed 6 inches in rural areas\nand 3 inches in urban areas using the 100-year storm event as required by USIBWC. \nTo verify the impacts are within the above mentioned limits, hydraulic models shall be \ndeveloped. The models shall be developed with HEC-RAS software using the 100-yr \ndischarges calculated in the hydrologic analyses of this scope.    Existing conditions and \n35\n\nA-E TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK\nTask Order under Contract No. W9126G-15-D-0009\nArchitect and Engineer Services for the Design of Floodwall, \nFence, Roads, Drainage, & Lights at Rio Grande Valley & San Diego\nproposed conditions models shall be developed at each applicable drainage crossing, and \nthe difference in water surface elevations shall be compared. The existing conditions cross \nsections shall be cut from the project survey data in the immediate area of the proposed \nproject and from the 30-meter elevation data outside of the survey area.  The proposed \ncondition models shall demonstrate that the impacts of proposed structures to be built \nwithin the floodplains of these drainage paths will not exceed the rise in water surface \nelevation limits stated above.  New construction or improvements more than 60 feet north \nof the border do not need to comply with the drainage treaty provisions mentioned above.\nThe Contractor shall address the following requirements for hydraulic analyses:\nDetermine local drainage runoff and/or sheet flow conditions as they cross the fence \nalignment.\nProvide the final hydraulic calculations identifying the final discharge velocity and rise \nin water surface elevation associated with the selected fence type at each identified wash\ncrossing. Maximum acceptable rise in water surface elevation shall be 6-inches at rural \nlocations and 3-inches at urban locations along the International Boundary.\nProvide final calculations showing depth of scour and/or long term degradation.  \nProvide details for protection against scour and/or long term degradation.\nProvide details for culvert and/or low water crossings at each wash crossing which \nsatisfies rise in water surface elevations stated above.  \nProvide hydrologic/hydraulic design and details showing that any/all cut and/or fill \noperations conducted within the project site do not adversely affect the natural drainage \npatterns across the site and satisfies the rise in water surface elevation stated above.\nProvide hydraulic design and details for any other site drainage improvements required \ndue to construction of the all-weather road.\n Conduct hydraulic analysis using HEC-RAS modeling.\nBased on the hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed for the programmatic drainage \nreport and in accordance with the TI design standards, the contractor shall make project \ndesign recommendations related to drainage conveyance through the fence, low water \ncrossings, culverts, drainage gates and erosion control.    The recommended types and sizes\nof these drainage features shall be specified in the final drainage report.  \nA drainage report will be prepared by the Contractor summarizing all hydrologic and \nhydraulic assumptions, drainage criteria, data, calculations, modeling, results and design \nrecommendations.  The report shall include maps of the locations of the identified drainage\ncrossings and their contributing drainage areas.  It shall specify the hydrologic method \nused at each location and include a summary of the calculations and assumptions used to \ncalculate frequency peak discharges.

The current version of the software program will be \nprovided to the A-E under contract who must then follow the prescribed licensing procedure to\nmake use of the software for the term of this contract.  Any other use of the software and the \ndatabase can be utilized per the terms of the licensing agreement with the manufacturer.  That \nlicensing agreement is not under the control of CESWF-EC-AC.  A PDF file of the project \nestimate must be submitted with the reports file. Hard copy requirements are denoted \nelsewhere. The estimate will not be complete until the bid opening estimate or final proposal \nestimate which includes all amendments and the completed bid or CLIN schedule in its final \nadvertised format have been submitted to CESWF prior to the construction contractors’ final \nproposal or bid deadline date shown in the solicitation or SF30. All pricing information \nincluded with any database or other source can and should be adapted, modified, changed, \nincreased, or decreased as deemed necessary by the estimator to prepare an estimate \nrepresentative of the project.  The information contained in any database or any other cost \ninformation provided by the Fort Worth District office, CESWF-EC-AC, or obtained from \nother sources is not intended to represent fixed prices for ordering supplies, equipment, \nmaterial, labor, nor any other construction component in the Government estimate.  The \nestimator's professional judgment and decisions should be the definitive factor in determining \nfair and reasonable costs calculated for submittals and reviews.  In MII, when submitting \nestimates for Military Projects, the Corps' current 20 system Work Breakdown Structure \n(WBS) will be used to structure the estimate (or PCCost 3086/1391 format when requested) \nunless CESWF-EC-AC determines that WBS is not applicable.

Compilation of the Current Working \nEstimate will incorporate the preceding sources and references utilizing the most recent \navailable software as stated and/or other TRACES software which may include MII, \nMCACES, PACES, PCCost, risk analysis programs, or any of the other approved systems \navailable to TRACES users. Any applicable software and databases which normally are \ndistributed without cost by CESWF-EC-AC will be made available to the A-E by CESWF-EC-\nAC under the Task Order.  Certain software programs and databases as described above and \nwhich also include PACES and RACER but are not limited to these mentioned herein may \nrequire purchase by the A-E and cannot be provided without cost to the A-E by CESWF-EC-\nAC. Construction cost estimates for planning and budgeting purposes and for projects at 0 - \n15% stages may be submitted by utilizing parametric software such as PACES and then \nsummarizing the costs in the PCCost software if CESWF-EC-AC deems this acceptable. Also \nfor any planning and budgeting purposes, PCCost software may be used to generate costs by \nutilizing the category codes and area cost factors in the PCCost database (which also includes \nArea Cost Factor data and adjustments).  Updates to the database are available from CESWF-\nEC-AC.   Electronic copies of all cost estimates in their native formats must be submitted \nalong with any txt, pdf, doc, and rtf type report files generated to produce the hard copies.\naa.Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit - A Pre-proposal Conference and Installation Site\nVisit shall be conducted for potential Offerors after the RFP is advertised.

In addition, BPFTI will coordinate the necessary NEPA-related approvals. USACE will \nexecute the design and construction of the project and assist BPFTI with the necessary real estate \nactions.\nThe project provides for the construction of 2.93 miles of tactical infrastructure and technology consisting \nof a reinforced concrete levee wall to the height of the existing levee with 18-ft tall steel bollards installed \non the top of the wall with automated vehicle gates for access to the south of the levee wall, an 150 foot \nenforcement zone including vegetation removal, detection techology, enforcement zone lighting, video \nsurveillance and an all-weather patrol road parallel to the levee wall.  The area outside of the road will be \nre-vegetated as deemed appropriate by environmental and USBP.\nLevee Wall:\nThe levee wall will be a concrete wall to the height of the levee crest with 18 ft. tall bollards installed in \nthe top of the levee wall. The existing levees are certified by FEMA from a flood protection perspective so\nwe will need to ensure the design and completed construction is re-certifiable, which we will likely be \nresponsible for obtaining (IBWC will have final say). Levee safety reviews and an ITR will be conducted \nby USACE. The levee wall will include automated vehicle gates for access south of the levee wall.\nGates:\nThe automated vehicle gates will be metal with a minimum height of 18 feet and minimum width of 20 \nfeet. The vehicle gates will be motorized overhead sliding gates with an enclosed drive and operator \nsystem that is operated by radio frequency activation and by pressing the appropriate pushbutton(s) on a\ncontrol console/key pad with emergency manual operations capabilities. There are six potential openings\nalong the levee wall that may require gating. Five openings would require vehicle gates and one opening \nwould require a pedestrian gate. The actual number, location and type of the gates will be determined \nduring the design phase.\nUnderground Sensor Detection System:\nAn underground sensor detection system will be installed in the enforcement zone. Its connection to the \nrequired electronics to make it operational will be the subject of a future project executed by USBP \nPMOD. \nLighting:\nEnforcement zone LED lighting will be installed as part of this project. Ideally the light fixtures will be \nmounted on poles located within the approximate center of the enforcement zone but compliance with \nfloodplain restrictions may dictate that they be mounted on the levee wall or bollards. The lights will be \ndesigned and constructed in accordance with the lighting design standards developed and confirmed as \npart of the San Luis lighting retrofit project recently completed in Yuma, AZ. The lights will be made fully \nfunctional as part of this project. The PMO will work with the appropriate stakeholders to develop \nsolutions to avoid excess lighting beyond the enforcement zone.\nAll Weather Road:\n\n  1.0 General Scope \nAn all-weather aggregate patrol road (type FC-2) will be constructed on the south side and parallel to the \nlevee wall and within the 150 ft enforcement zone. The specific location of the road witin the enforcement\nzone will be determined during the design phase of the project.\nVegetation Clearing:\nAll vegetation in the 150 ft. enforcement zone will be cleared. \nCameras:\nThe camera surveillance system will ensure visibility of the enforcement zone and southern approach. \nView shed analysis will be completed by USBP and provided to BPAM. Analysis will be required to \nensure loss of power and visibility does not occur in the instance of a flood. All technology will be \nprovided by USBP, infrastructure will be constructed and funded by BPAM.\nThe enforcement system is critical to RGV Sector’s ability to prevent illegal entries (whether people, \nnarcotics, etc.) and to achieve operational control of the border commensurate with Executive Order \n13767.  The project is located within Weslaco Station Zone 11 in Alamo, Texas. The project alignment will\nbe along the south toe of the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) levee along the\nmaintenance road, see attached project map.\nThe project will be a design bid build construction project under an existing unrestricted horizontal \nMATOC at USACE. USACE, CBP, USBP, and IBWC technical reviews will happen concurrently.\nKey Product Deliverables:\nThe key deliverables are the 100% design of the enforcement system by an AE firm and the construction \nof the enforcement system.\nCustomer Requirements:\nThe Border Patrol requires an enforcement system that meets its operational requirements. Reliance on \nthe most current CBP Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Design Standards will ensure that Border Patrols \nrequirements are met.\nProject Goals:\nThis project involves the design and construction of a reinforced concrete levee wall to the height of the existing \nIBWC levee with 18-foot tall steel bollards installed in the top of the wall and automated vehicle gates for access \nsouth of the levee wall, an 150 foot enforcement zone including vegetation removal detection technology, \nenforcement zone lighting, video surveillance and an all-weather patrol road parallel to the levee wall.  \nThe area outside of the road will be re-vegetated as deemed appropriate by environmental and USBP.\nDescription of Special Requirements or Circumstances:\nIBWC: The U.S. IBWC must review and concur with the design and completed construction of the levee \nwall.\nFEMA: The design and completed construction must be approved and certified by FEMA according to \ntheir standards for flood protection. FEMA coordination will be an independent approval from IBWC, but \nwill have similar effort to the IBWC approval.  This will be a separate hydraulic model than the IBWC \nmodel.\n\n  1.0 General Scope \nReal Estate: \nNEPA: \n\n\n\nProject Requirements Document Drafted\nPMP Approved\nDesign\nReceipt of AE money - complete\nAE SOW/QASP/FOS - complete\nAE IGE - complete\nAE Requirement Advertised - complete\nAE Proposal Received - complete\nAE Task Order Award – complete\nConstruction\nPre-Solicitation Notice \nFinal Docs from AE firm \nOC review of IFB \nAdvertise\nBid Opening\nPre-Award Activities \nCongressional Notification \nConstruction Funds Received \nIFB Award\nBonds Received\nPre-Con\n1st NTP (base 2.6 miles)\n2nd NTP (option 0.3 miles)\nConstruction Complete\n 5.0 Funding / Resources \n5.1 Funding Requirements - Performance Measurements\nCustomer Requirements about Requesting/Receiving Funds:\nFunds will be requested via the DHS change management process in the FITT system.\nCustomer Reporting Requirements:\nCustomer reporting requirements are still under development.

Brian Giacomozzi \nrequested the call with \nEric Halpin to get further guidance on procedures to follow on design/construction \nof the T wall and \nbollard fence on top. Some recommendations made:\n1- Follow Corps tech design standards\n2-Inspect and Screen impacted IBWC levees as part of inspection initiative of all \n\"outlier\" levees. I \nbelieve our regional team is ready to go\n3-RMC and others to send Brian G some guidance on interim protection measures to \nhave in place once \nthe front side of the levee is peeled back prior to T wall installation. \n4-I sent SWF latest I had from FEMA Region 6 on certification status of the \nimpacted levees. SWF , FEMA, \nand  IBWC to meet next week to discuss further\n5-Eric advised not to deliver \"certification/accreditation\" as part of construction\nbut we should be able \nto rebuild to original design which may get them their \n6-Fence will be 18 ft high above wall, embedded 4 ft in wall, consists of 6 by 6 \nsquare pipe with 4 inch \ngaps\n7- Steve Fink had asked me whether this project may be a good one for next Levee \nSafety Newsletter. \nSeemed to be hesitancy in group about messaging this potentially politically \nsensitive project\nCopying both Brian's in case I missed

Background\nExecutive Order 13767 Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, signed 25 \nJanuary 2017 Trump, calls to immediately plan, design and construct a physical wall along the \nsouthern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete\noperational control. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requested USACE to assist in \nthe planning, design, and construction of border infrastructure to support CBP in its mission to \nachieve operational control of the border.   This interagency support mission has been accepted \nby Headquarters USACE and may require support from across the USACE enterprise.   The \nUSACE Program Management Office (PMO) Border Infrastructure is located in Fort Worth \nDistrict, but is a direct report to the Commander, Southwestern Division. \n2. Reference\na. Department of Defense Principles of Information – 9 Nov 2001 \nb. AR 360-1, Army Public Affairs Program \n3. Purpose\nThe purpose of the Strategic Communication Plan is to define communication roles and \nresponsibilities of USACE Commands and Offices, communication protocols and frequency \nrequired to deliver all requirements in support of the mission.\n4.  Project Communications Partners\na.

Other cooperating Federal agency public affairs offices – Department of Justice, \nU.S. Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, Bureau of Land Management, U.S.\nFish & Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S Forest \nService and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n5. Communication Management\n    a.   Two-way communication and transparency is a cornerstone to success and customer \nsatisfaction. PMO Border Infrastructure is responsible for creating standard operating \nprocedures for communication and a joint communication plan with PMO BPAM.\nDRAFT                                                                      1                       FOR OFFICIAL\nUSE ONLY      2 June 2017\n\n    b.   External communications responsibilities. As the lead agency, CBP is the public \nvoice of this important national security mission and will take the public communications \nlead. PMO Border Infrastructure Public Affairs will take the external public communications \nlead role within USACE. Working with the PMO BPAM, PMO Border Infrastructure Public \nAffairs will be a public voice whenever USACE has a unique operational lead in a program \ntask. These unique responsibilities are outlined in Appendices 1 to 4 below.\n       c. Outreach communication to stakeholders outside the program. The PMO BPAM \nand its Outreach & Communications IPT will be responsible for coordinating this effort with \nPMO Border Infrastructure’s support.\n      d. USACE communications pathways. Both vertical and horizontal communication is \nto be encouraged. Vertical communication originating at PMO Border Infrastructure Public \nAffairs is through SWD Public Affairs Office (PAO) for all significant actions. SWD PAO is \nresponsible for the communications pathway both to SPD PAO and to HQUSACE PAO. \nHorizontal communication will flow from PMO Border Infrastructure Public Affairs to HQ-\nUSACE, SWD, SPD, SWF, SWG, SPL, SPA and SPK. Interagency horizontal public affairs \ncommunications will flow between PMO Border Infrastructure Public Affairs and PMO \nBPAM Communications Team. \n      e. Unitary voice. PMO Border Infrastructure and PMO BPAM will work together to \nensure that all mission messaging is timely, accurate, consistent, uses the same terminology \nand works in partnership to respond to all media queries. Communications products, such as \nPublic Affairs Guidance, will be jointly prepared as part of the media planning in advance of \nall major milestones.  \n      f. Message discipline. All USACE staff and contractors should be kept informed of the \noverall mission. Where possible, the “Corps story” should also be told. At the same time, no \nemployee or contractor should talk to the public or media about the mission. In the field, only\nthe CBP Office of Public Affairs or a Border Patrol agent can speak about the mission to the \npublic or media. Media questions can also be referred to the PMO Border Infrastructure \npublic affairs. \n6. Communications awareness \n    a. Intense media scrutiny. This is a controversial project generating great public interest. \nThis is also a fast-paced program where unexpected developments can be expected. These \ncommunications challenges will be met promptly and communicated up and down the \nUSACE organizational chain and shared with our CBP partners immediately. There is no \nsuch thing as too much communication. You cannot partner halfway.\n     b. Safety. Hazards in the border construction zone are a real concern. This may arise from\nintruders/illegal entrants/smugglers but also from protests. Some protests could target \nUSACE offices distant from the border, particularly those associated with Command, control,\nand support of this mission. Social media can mobilize opposition protests on short notice \nand intensify opposition. Security requires rapid communications in the field and up the \nchain of supervision.\n     c. Personal conduct. USACE employees need to be mindful to protect the image of the \nArmy and to demand professional conduct from ourselves and others. It is a 24/7 concern.\nDRAFT                                                                      2                       FOR OFFICIAL\nUSE ONLY      6 June 2017\n\nd. Risk Communications.  Even though CBP provides the public voice for this mission, \nUSACE leaders and key individuals that can be expected to come into contact with the public\nincidentally while performing work related to this mission should be aware of risk \ncommunications and public participation principles. \n7. Key Messages\nDurable base messaging for use in public contacts. USACE employees and contractors \ndo not speak for the program – CBP does – but the following is suitable in explaining the \nprogram and our supporting role whenever asked.  \n(1) Executive Order 13767, Border Security and Immigration Enforcement \nImprovements, calls for the immediate planning, design and construction of a physical \nwall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology, to achieve \ncomplete operational control of the border. CBP’s strategy to operationally control the \nborder includes three components: adequate law enforcement personnel, technology and \ntactical infrastructure. These three measures together deter, detect, and apprehend \nunauthorized aliens. Tactical infrastructure includes walls, fencing, roads, lights and \ncameras. \n(2) The USACE has a 20-year history of providing interagency support to Customs and \nBorder Protection, and its predecessor agencies, in executing its border security mission.  \n(3) CBP is currently defining the requirements for additional tactical infrastructure \nrequired to comply with Executive Order 13767 and appropriations by Congress.  The \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers is prepared to perform planning, design, engineering, real \nestate acquisition, contract acquisition, and construction as requested by Customs and \nBorder Protection. \nAppendix 1: Real Estate Communications Plan \nTo provide communications guidelines and reporting paths for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nemployees and private contractors engaged in real estate activities in support of the Border \nInfrastructure Program.\nGeneral Background   \nRef: Key Messages / Durable Base Messaging for use in public contracts in Annex R above.\nThe Border Infrastructure Program is controversial and has drawn public opposition. Because of \nthe especially sensitive nature of real estate work, all USACE employees and contractors must \nunderstand and adopt communications restrictions. All USACE employees and their \nrepresentatives must conduct themselves in the field in a way that preserves and enhances the \nArmy’s reputation with the public. Any activities that may lead to real estate acquisition may be \nstrongly opposed by landowners who do not want to sell and do not want government \nrepresentatives on their land. The government may have to utilize eminent domain to acquire \nsome tracts. Litigation can be expected.  \nAdhering to the guidelines and restrictions below will help ensure project success.\nDRAFT                                                                      3                       FOR OFFICIAL\nUSE ONLY      6 June 2017\n\nFundamental Communications Principles: RESTRICTIONS\n Officials of the Department of Homeland Security, including U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection and the Border Patrol, are the sole “face and spokespersons” for the Border \nInfrastructure Program. \n Do not talk to the media, period. Refer all media queries to DHS/CBP/Border Patrol \nofficials as indicated below.\n Never offer opinions about the Border Infrastructure Program to anybody.\n In the course of your work in the field, discuss your activities only with those with whom \nyou must work. Do not volunteer additional information about the program.  \nFundamental Communications Principles: WHAT YOU CAN SAY\nIf you are asked about the program, you may use the following statement. \n“The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is executing this important national security project for the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security along the international border at the direction of the \nAdministration and as funded by Congress. DHS officials within U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection are the sole spokespersons for this program.” \nAll USACE employees and contractors in the field should carry a “business card” that includes \nthe statement above and provides referral information to others who are authorized to speak.\nCommunications pathways\nPMO BPAM has the lead in outreach communication planning for every major real estate action.\nPMO Border Infrastructure Real Estate and Public Affairs have a supporting role.  \nCBP Office of Public Affairs has the public communications lead and full release authority on \nthe real estate effort. Any exceptions will be agreed to in collaboration between the PMO Border \nInfrastructure and PMO BPAM communications teams.\nCBP Office of Public Affairs and Department of Justice Public Affairs will have the lead on all \nmedia queries regarding eminent domain, land acquisition and litigation over real estate in this \nBorder Infrastructure Program.\nBPAM PMO, Border Patrol and PMO Border Infrastructure Real Estate will collaborate on joint \nlandholder outreach actions, either in one-on-one or larger town hall-style landowner information\nmeetings for this program. Border Infrastructure Public Affairs has a supporting role and help \nCBP Office of Public Affairs for their media guidance planning.  Separate joint CBP/USACE \nPublic Affairs Guidance will be provided prior to engagement with landholders based on the \nnature of the real estate interest being acquired for the project and the forum in which the \nlandholder will be contacted.   \nPMO Border Infrastructure Public Affairs is responsible for providing timely advance notice for \nall major real estate actions to USACE Headquarters as well as border program Division and \nDistrict Public Affairs Offices (SWD, SPD, SPK, SPL, SPA, SWF and SWG). \n***\nExamples of public interaction: Q&A\nDRAFT                                                                      4                       FOR OFFICIAL\nUSE ONLY      6 June 2017\n\nQ1: If a member of the media approaches you with questions about the Border Infrastructure \nProgram, what do you say?\nA1: USACE and contractor personnel should never speak to the media on behalf of the program, \nor provide information or opinions.

The Army supports vigorous competition to ensure value for the \ngovernment. Competition is further heightened by providing opportunities to small business to \ndevelop and join the broad base of suppliers that strengthen our nation’s economic development. \nThe Army is committed to using small businesses and often leads the federal government in total \ncontract dollars awarded to them each year. \nCommunications pathways\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security are the \nleads on all media inquiries about the border infrastructure program. However, certain tasks, \nsuch as acquisition, may be delegated within narrow lanes for PMO Border Infrastructure Public \naffairs to answer. All overall mission questions, including specifics of where and when border \ninfrastructure will be built, remains with CBP Public Affairs. These lanes will be clearly \ndelineated in advance in full collaboration with PMO BPAM.  \nDRAFT                                                                      5                       FOR OFFICIAL\nUSE ONLY      6 June 2017\n\nPMO Border Infrastructure Public Affairs will have the lead in generating, communicating and \nexecuting public affairs actions. For the most critical actions, that pathway is through \nSouthwestern Division Public Affairs Office (PAO), which is responsible for SPL and HQ-\nUSACE PAO as appropriate. Horizontal communication will flow from PMO Border \nInfrastructure Public Affairs to HQ-USACE, SWD, SPD, SWF, SWG, SPL, SPA and SPK. \nInteragency horizontal public affairs communications will flow between PMO Border \nInfrastructure Public Affairs and PMO BPAM Communications Team. \nCommunications Action Milestones\nStep-by-step communications actions. USACE acquisition actions may generate media queries. \n1. Advance preparation: \na. 10 days before any action, notify PMO BPAM Communications Team and \ncoordinate.\nb. 10 days before, PMO BPAM and PMO Border Infrastructure Communications \nTeams should delineate clear USACE and CBP Public Affairs lanes for the \nannouncement. These must be clearly understood and with a unity of messaging.\nc. 10 days before announcement, PMO Border Infrastructure public affairs specialist\nbegins working with PMO Border Infrastructure team members to prepare a \nPublic Affairs Guidance (PAG) sheet. This PAG will guide both CBP and USACE\ncommunications. It should explain the action. It should emphasize key messages. \nIt should provide a Q&A to address expected questions. This guidance should be \nshared with SWD PAO Chief. The PAO Chief will share with SPD and HQ-\nUSACE PAOs as appropriate.   \nd. PMO Border Infrastructure should consider whether any particular announcement\nis appropriate as a short news release. This can be an opportunity to tell the Corps \nstory and should only be done in full collaboration with PMO BPAM and written \nwell in advance. \ne. At least two working days in advance, provide PMO BPAM with a copy of the \ndraft announcement text and Public Affairs Guidance sheet. [Contract awards \ntext will be left incomplete without names and dollar amount.]  PMO Border \nInfrastructure Public Affairs will notify all PAO chiefs in SWD, SPD, SPK, SPL, \nSPA, SWF and SWG that the announcement is imminent.
