    "summary": "<p>This suit, filed on Sept. 14, 2017, challenged President Trump's authorization of the construction of a border wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Plaintiffs, environmental advocacy organizations (Defenders of Wildlife, the Sierra Club, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund), sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for failing to comply with existing laws and for taking actions beyond the scope of its authority. Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.</p>\r\n<p>On Jan. 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02095.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No. 13767</a>, which directed DHS to \"take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border.\" The EO cited as its authority the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996. IIRIRA &sect; 102 allows the Secretary of DHS to \"take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads ... in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\" Further, under the REAL ID Act of 2005, the Secretary may \"waive all legal requirements [that the] Secretary, in such Secretary&rsquo;s sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.&rdquo; IIRIRA also restricts judicial review of such action.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this, plaintiffs argued that &sect; 102 also limits the Secretary's discretion to issue waivers, and that defendants had here overstepped these limits. First, plaintiffs argued that the IIRIRA waiver provision is limited to \"the installation of 'additional physical barriers and road[s]...in areas of high illegal entry,'\" and does not authorize replacement of existing barriers and roads, construction of temporary prototype walls, or the construction of barriers and roads in areas that are not \"of high illegal entry into the United States.\" Further, plaintiffs argued that the Secretary's authority to issue waivers had expired in 2008, and that Congress had never again granted this authority since 2005. Finally, plaintiffs alleged that the Secretary did not explain how DHS had identified \"high illegal entry\" at the proposed border wall sites.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs asserted that DHS twice attempted to exercise this waiver, on Aug. 2 and Sept. 12, 2017, with respect to portions of the California border pursuant to the EO. In so doing, plaintiffs argued that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and various federal environmental statutes. Additionally, plaintiffs alleged that the border wall would harm borderland wildlife areas and thus plaintiffs' members who frequented these areas.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Specifically, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the IIRIRA waiver provision did not apply to DHS's proposed activities pursuant to the EO, that the two California waivers did not comply with the IIRIRA waiver provision, and that both the California waivers and the IIRIRA provision itself violated the Presentment Clauses, the Nondelegation Doctrine, and the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\r\n<p>The case was first assigned to Judge Jeffrey T. Miller and then reassigned to Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel on Sept. 20. The Court also, on Sept. 15, granted plaintiffs' request to relate this case to another recent case filed by environmental groups challenging the border wall, <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Center for Biological Diversity v. DHS</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>The parties jointly requested on Oct. 20 that this case be consolidated with <em>Center for Biological Diversity</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California v. U.S.</a></em>. On Oct. 24, Judge Curiel granted the motion.</p>\r\n<p>This case has been consolidated with <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Center for Biological Diversity v. DHS</a></em> and continues at that page.</p>",

As a candidate for president, Donald Trump’s standard stump speech included a \n28 refrain to build a 1900-mile border wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. \nCOMPLAINT  1 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.38   Page 2 of 26\n \n1 Upon taking office, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Department \n2 of Homeland Security (DHS) to “take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, \n3 and construct a physical wall along the southern border.” This case challenges the DHS’s \n4 authority to expedite the construction of barriers, roads and a prototype border wall in the \n5 vicinity of the United States and Mexican border near San Diego and Calexico, \n6 California, and pursuant to Section 102(c)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n7 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. \n8 3009-546 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, \n9 Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 306, by waiving the application of all federal, state, \n10 or other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, or related to the \n11 subject of more than three dozen federal statutes.  \n12 2.  On August 2, 2017, DHS Secretary John F. Kelly issued a waiver pursuant to \n13 Section 102(c) of IIRIRA, allowing DHS and its components, including the U.S. Customs \n14 and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol), to proceed with \n15 constructing additional border infrastructure in the Border Patrol ’s San Diego Sector. \n16 Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n17 Responsibility Act of 1996, As Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984 (hereinafter “San Diego” \n18 or “August 2, 2017” Waiver). This Waiver includes area in the vicinity of the U.S.-\n19 Mexican border near the San Diego, California, starting at the Pacific Ocean and \n20 extending approximately 15 miles eastward, by purportedly waiving “all federal, state, or \n21 other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, or related to” thirty-\n22 seven validly enacted federal statutes.  \n23 3.  On September 12, 2017, Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke issued a similar \n24 waiver covering activities in Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector to expedite the construction \n25 of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the U.S.-Mexican border near city of Calexico, \n26 California, purportedly waiving “all federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal \n27 requirements of, deriving from, or related to” twenty-eight validly enacted statutes. \n28 Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nCOMPLAINT  2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.39   Page 3 of 26\n \n1 Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829, 42,830-31 (hereinafter \n2 “Calexico” or “September 12, 2017” Waiver). \n3 4.  These waivers purportedly allow construction and related activities to transpire \n4 without adhering to legal protections Congress has established for, inter alia, endangered \n5 species, migratory birds, water pollution, historic preservation, safe drinking water, noise \n6 pollution, hazardous waste disposal, coastal zones, public lands, outdoor recreation, \n7 religious freedom and practice, and administrative procedures. \n8 5.  Plaintiffs allege that the Secretary’s Waivers are ultra vires agency actions, made \n9 outside the scope of authority granted by Section 102(c) of IIRIRA, as amended. Neither \n10 the replacement or prototype border wall projects authorized in the San Diego Waiver, \n11 for example, are among the activities eligible for waivers under Section 102(c) of \n12 IIRIRA. In addition, the statute does not support the continued, unlimited application of \n13 Section 102(c) waivers to the construction of physical barriers and roads beyond those \n14 initially specified by Congress when enacting IIRIRA in 1996. DHS has, nonetheless, \n15 completed specific congressional mandates in Section 102(b), and the Secretary’s \n16 authority to identify and construct other border walls and roads expired in 2008. \n17 6.  Plaintiffs further allege that the Secretary’s conclusions, made pursuant to Section \n18 102(a) of IIRIRA, that both the San Diego and El Centro Sectors are “areas of high \n19 illegal entry into the United States,” and decision to not comply with the consultation \n20 requirements of Section 102(b) are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n21 otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n22 (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n23 7.  Plaintiffs further allege that the Secretary’s waiver, and the authority to waive all \n24 laws provided by IIRIRA, as amended by the REAL ID Act, violate the principles of \n25 Separation of Powers contained in Articles I, II, and III of the U.S. Constitution. \n26 Specifically, the waiver violates the Presentment Clauses, Article I, Section 7, clauses 2 \n27 and 3, the nondelegation doctrine embodied in Article I, Section I, which directs that \n28\nCOMPLAINT  3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.40   Page 4 of 26\n \n1 “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \n2 States,” and infringes on the Judicial Power of the federal courts, Article III, Section 1.  \n3 8.  Plaintiffs therefore seek a declaration that the waiver and the statutory provision \n4 authorizing such waivers are unconstitutional, as well as an injunction barring DHS or \n5 any of its components from constructing any border infrastructure in the Border Patrol’s \n6 San Diego and El Centro Sectors without full adherence to all applicable laws. \n7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8 9.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \n9 question), § 1346(a)(2) (civil action against the United States), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. \n10 10.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (3), because \n11 defendants are officers, employees, or agencies of the United States and a substantial part \n12 of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, and the property that is the \n13 subject of the action is situated here. \n14 PARTIES \n15 11.  Plaintiff DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE (Defenders) is a nonprofit organization \n16 with hundreds of thousands of members across the nation, including tens of thousands of \n17 members in California. Defenders’ mission is to preserve wildlife and emphasize \n18 appreciation and protection for all species in their ecological role. within the natural \n19 advocacy, litigation, and other efforts, Defenders works to preserve species and the \n20 habitats upon which they depend. Defenders has been closely involved in policy and \n21 litigation matters associated with border wall construction along the United States-\n22 Mexican border for more than a decade. Defenders maintains a Field Office with five \n23 full-time employees in California. \n24 12.  Defenders has organizational and membership-based interests in the preservation \n25 and conservation of the borderlands of the Southwestern United States that will be \n26 harmed by the expeditious construction of barriers and roads at issue in this case. For \n27 more than two decades, Defenders has worked for the protection of borderland wildlife \n28 and ecosystems. Defenders has played a leading role in efforts to educate the public and \nCOMPLAINT  4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.41   Page 5 of 26\n \n1 advocate for better integration of environmental considerations into immigration policy \n2 generally, and into border security efforts specifically. \n3 13.  Defenders’ members live near and regularly visit the borderlands near San Diego \n4 and the Imperial Valley for wildlife observation, recreation, and other uses. Defenders’ \n5 members also live in other areas along the California border adversely impacted by the \n6 border wall projects being constructed throughout the area. These members have \n7 aesthetic, educational, professional, health, and spiritual interests that will be harmed by \n8 the environmental impacts that will result from the DHS Secretary’s decision to waive \n9 the 37 laws, and the procedural and substantive protections that would have otherwise \n10 been provided, to expedite the construction of barriers and roads by waiving expedite the \n11 San Diego border wall, and the unconstitutional grant of legislative powers to the DHS \n12 Secretary contained in Section 102(c) of the REAL ID Act.  \n13 14.  Plaintiff ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND (ALDF) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) \n14 organization with more than 200,000 members and supporters, nearly 25,000 of whom \n15 reside in California and 2,000 of whom reside in San Diego County. ALDF represents its \n16 members interests by working to protect the lives of animals, including wildlife, through \n17 the legal system. ALDF is headquartered on Cotati, California, with regional offices in \n18 Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon. \n19 15.  ALDF has an organizational and membership-based interest in ensuring the letter \n20 and spirit of wildlife- and wildland-protection statutes are fully upheld and the \n21 constitutional principles enabling these laws’ implementation are respected. ALDF \n22 pursues it purpose of safeguarding animal welfare in part by persistently advocating for \n23 government adherence to wildlife-protection laws such as the National Environmental \n24 Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the \n25 Administrative Procedure Act (to name a few)—each of which has been waived by the \n26 DHS Secretary in conjunction with San Diego border wall construction. ALDF has \n27 expended significant organizational resources on advocacy and public education efforts \n28 to improve environmental protections for wildlife living on protected lands such as the \nCOMPLAINT  5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.42   Page 6 of 26\n \n1 borderlands at issue here, and will continue to do so if the border wall is built without \n2 adherence to the laws the DHS Secretary is attempting to waive. \n3 16.  ALDF’s members live in or regularly visit the U.S.-Mexico borderlands region in \n4 San Diego County. ALDF’s members regularly use the myriad federal, state, and local \n5 protected lands along the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego County—including areas \n6 impacted by and/or adjacent to the location of the border wall prototype project and the \n7 border wall replacement project—for hiking, camping, wildlife viewing and photography, \n8 and other vocational and recreational activities. ALDF’s members derive recreational, \n9 educational, and aesthetic benefit from their activities in these areas. ALDF’s members \n10 have specific intentions to continue to use and enjoy these areas frequently and on an \n11 ongoing basis in the future. \n12 17.  ALDF has an established track record of active participation in the oversight of \n13 government activities and decision-making, particularly with regard to laws and policies \n14 affecting wildlife. ALDF expends considerable organizational resources in doing so, \n15 including costs associated with litigation and educating the public. ALDF regularly \n16 represents its members’ interests in this regard by filing lawsuits, training law students \n17 and professionals, and publishing and disseminating informational materials to its \n18 members. \n19 18.  ALDF and its members are harmed by Federal Defendants’ constitutional \n20 violations, in that the unconstitutional grant of legislative powers to the DHS Secretary \n21 contained in Section 102(c) of the REAL ID Act, and the DHS Secretary’s decision to \n22 waive the procedural and substantive protections of the 37 laws in order to expedite the \n23 construction of barriers and roads associated with the San Diego border wall, pose an \n24 imminent impact on the local ecosystems, including wildlife populations. These impacts \n25 will directly harm ALDF’s members’ aesthetic and recreational interests in their \n26 continued enjoyment of the San Diego County borderlands, and will additionally harm \n27 ALDF as an organization due to the forced diversion of ALDF resources to protect the \n28 wild animals affected by the illegal border wall construction in fulfillment of its mission. \nCOMPLAINT  6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.43   Page 7 of 26\n \n1 19.   Plaintiff SIERRA CLUB is incorporated in the State of California as a nonprofit \n2 public benefit corporation with headquarters in Oakland, California. The Sierra Club is a \n3 national organization with 67 chapters and more than 825,000 members dedicated to \n4 exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth; to educating and enlisting \n5 humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to \n6 using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club’s San Diego chapter has \n7 more than 9,700 members. Sierra Club’s San Diego members’ advocacy at the southern \n8 border includes educating and mobilizing the public on issues of habitat destruction, \n9 divided local communities, land use and myriad other human and environmental impacts \n10 associated with border wall construction activities. Sierra Club has been actively involved \n11 in southern border issues for many years, including work to protect the Tijuana Estuary, \n12 an ecosystem rich with birds and other wildlife species.  \n13 20.  Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its members. \n14 Sierra Club members live near and frequently visit the California-Mexico border around \n15 San Diego for hiking, bird watching, photography and other recreational and aesthetic \n16 uses. Sierra Club and its San Diego members have been and continue to be injured by the \n17 construction activities on the southern border. This is particularly true because the \n18 Department of Homeland Security is proceeding with border work absent compliance \n19 with decades-old environmental and public safety laws and regulations, enacted for the \n20 very purpose of protecting the places and values Sierra Club members work to protect. \n21 The requested relief will redress this injury. \n22 21.  Defendant DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) is the executive \n23 department responsible for, inter alia, enforcing and administering laws related to \n24 immigration and securing and managing the nation’s borders. \n25 22.  Defendant ELAINE DUKE (Secretary), Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, is \n26 sued in her official capacity. Acting Secretary Duke exercised the waiver provision of \n27 Section 102(c) of IIRIRA in her September 12, 2017 Determination. Acting Secretary \n28 Duke is the successor to DHS Secretary John Kelly, who exercised the waiver provision \nCOMPLAINT  7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.44   Page 8 of 26\n \n1 of Section 102(c) of IIRIRA in his August 22, 2017 Determination. Acting Secretary \n2 Duke is responsible for ensuring that DHS actions comply with applicable laws. \n3 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n4 Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n5 23.  Section 102(a) the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n6 of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \n7 § 1103 note), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 \n8 Stat. 306, as amended by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, 120 \n9 Stat. 2638, as amended by the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n10 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V, § 564(a), 121 Stat. 2090-91 (Dec. 26, 2007), \n11 directs the Secretary to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional \n12 physical barriers and roads … in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal \n13 crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note \n14 (hereinafter “Section 102” or “IIRIRA § 102”). \n15 24.  Section 102(c), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, authorizes the Secretary \n16 “to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, \n17 determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under \n18 this section.” IIRIRA § 102(c)(1). \n19 25.  IIRIRA, as amended, does not limit the type or number of laws that the Secretary \n20 may waive under Section 102(c). \n21 26.   IIRIRA, as amended, does not limit the length of time that a waiver made pursuant \n22 to Section 102(c) can be valid. \n23 27.  Section 102(c) restricts judicial review of Secretarial waiver determinations to the \n24 district courts of the United States, which may only hear a “cause of action or claim … \n25 alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States” that is filed within 60 days \n26 of Secretary’s decision. IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A), (B).  \n27\n28\nCOMPLAINT  8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.45   Page 9 of 26\n \n1 28.  District court decisions, moreover, are not subject to review by a court of appeals, \n2 and “may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of \n3 the United States.” IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(C). \n4 29.  Congress enacted the Section 102(c) waiver authority more than twelve years ago, \n5 which the Secretary has utilized six times prior to August 2, 2017. \n6 30.  The first Section 102(c) waiver, issued by DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, \n7 became effective on September 22, 2005, and included waiving eight laws to facilitate \n8 the construction of border fences and roads starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending 14 \n9 miles eastward. Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n10 and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 as Amended by Section 102 of the REAL ID \n11 Act of 2005, 70 Fed. Reg. 55,622, 55,623 (2005). \n12 31.  In 1996, Congress specifically identified the 14-miles of border infrastructure \n13 covered in this waiver in IIRIRA Section 102(b)(1), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 \n14 Stat. 3009-554. In 2002, Congress expressed that completing this “14-mile border fence \n15 project … should be a priority for the Secretary.” 6 U.S.C. § 256. \n16 The San Diego Waiver \n17 32.  On August 2, 2017, the Secretary utilized the waiver authority of Section 102(c) to \n18 “immediately implement various border infrastructure projects… on an approximately \n19 fifteen mile segment of the border within the San Diego Sector that starts at the Pacific \n20 Ocean and extends eastward.” 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984. \n21 33.  The “Project Area” included under the San Diego Waiver extends for \n22 approximately fifteen-miles and is described as the “area in the vicinity of the United \n23 States border, located in the state of California within the United States Border Patrol’s \n24 San Diego Sector… Starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending to approximately one \n25 mile east of Border Monument 251.” Id. at 35,985.  \n26 34.  The Secretary issued the San Diego Waiver to expedite “the construction of roads \n27 and physical barriers (including, but not limited to, accessing the Project Area, creating \n28 and using staging areas, the conduct of earthwork, excavation, fill, and site preparation, \nCOMPLAINT  9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.46   Page 10 of 26\n \n1 and installation and upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, \n2 erosion controls, and safety features) in the Project Area.” Id. \n3 35.  Under color of the San Diego Waiver, “DHS will replace existing primary fencing \n4 in the Project Area … [and] also build prototype border wall in the Project Area near the \n5 eastern terminus of the existing secondary barrier.” Id. at 35,984-85 (emphasis added). \n6 36.  In the San Diego Waiver, the Secretary purportedly waived, “in their entirety… all \n7 federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, or \n8 related to the subject of” thirty-seven enumerated statutes:  \n9 a.

The “Project Area” includes areas with significant environmental values and \n16 irreplaceable natural resources. \n17 47.  Within approximately 150-feet of the U.S.-Mexican border in the approximately \n18 fifteen-mile long “Project Area,” the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Information \n19 for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) project planning tool identifies twenty-seven \n20 species listed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act and designated Critical Habitat for \n21 five of these listed species.

In the September 12, 2017 Waiver, the Secretary declared that the  \n7 El Centro Sector is an area of high illegal entry. … [T]hrough the \nconstruction of border infrastructure and other operational improvements, \n8\nthe Border Patrol has been able to make significant gains in border security \n9 within the El Centro Sector; however, more work needs to be done.

In addition, eighteen FWS Birds of Conservation Concern might be affected by \n4 construction activities in the Project Area, including certain birds normally protected \n5 under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Eagle Protection Act. Id. \n6 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7 (Ultra Vires Agency Action under Section 102(c) of IIRIRA) \n8 64.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the foregoing paragraphs as \n9 though fully set forth herein. \n10 65.  Section 102(a) of IIRIRA, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to “take such \n11 actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads … in the \n12 vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry \n13 into the United States.” (Emphasis added). \n14 66.  Section 102(b) of IIRIRA directs the Secretary to “construct reinforced fencing … \n15 where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of \n16 additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational \n17 control of the southwest border” to the extent necessary “in carrying out subsection (a).” \n18 67.  Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA authorizes the Secretary to “waive all legal \n19 requirements such Secretary … determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction \n20 of the barriers and roads under this section.” (Emphasis added.) \n21 68.  The Section 102(c) of IIRIRA waiver authority applies only to the installation of \n22 new, “additional physical barriers and road,” IIRIRA § 102(a) (emphasis added), and \n23 cannot be used for the border wall replacement or the prototype border wall project \n24 included in the San Diego and Calexico Waivers. \n25 69.  As enacted in 1996, Section 102(b) of IIRIRA applied only to the border area \n26 “[n]ear San Diego, California,” being limited to “construction along the 14 miles of the \n27 international land border of the United States, starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending \n28\nCOMPLAINT  18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.55   Page 19 of 26\n \n1 eastward, of second and third fences, in addition to the existing reinforced fence, and for \n2 roads between the fences.” Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, § 102(b) 110 Stat. 3554. \n3 70.  Seventeen months after adding the waiver provision to Section 102(c) of IIRIRA in \n4 the REAL ID Act of 2005, the Secure Fence of 2006 amended Section 102(b) of IIRIRA \n5 by striking “Near San Diego, California,” and directing the Secretary to construct at \n6 “least 2 layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, \n7 lighting, cameras, and sensors” in five specific areas totaling approximately 850 miles. \n8 Pub. L. No. 109-367 § 3, 120 Stat 2639. \n9 71.  Fourteen months after passing the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Section 102(b) of \n10 IIRIRA was again amended in the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008, by removing previous \n11 specified areas and requiring the Secretary to “construct reinforced fencing along not less \n12 than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and \n13 effective.” Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V, § 564(a), 121 Stat. 2090 (2007). \n14 72.  In addition, the 2008 Appropriations Act required the Secretary to “identify” and \n15 “construct” “370 miles, or other mileage determined by the Secretary, whose authority to \n16 determine other mileage shall expire on December 31, 2008, along the southwest border \n17 where fencing would be most practical and effective.” Id. \n18 73.  Section 102(c) of IIRIRA’s waiver provision has remained unchanged by Congress \n19 since the amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005. \n20 74.   There is no indication that Section 102(c) of IIRIRA applies to the 2006 and 2008 \n21 amendments to Section 102(b). \n22 75.  Assuming, arguendo, the enlarged barrier border authorization in the 2008 IIRIRA \n23 amendments were eligible for waivers under Section 102(c), DHS has completed those \n24 specified mandates and the Secretary’s authority to identify and construct other mileage \n25 expired on December 31, 2008. \n26 76.  Further, the purported Waivers are not necessary to ensure the “expeditious” \n27 construction of the border wall prototype project and border walls envisioned twelve \n28 years ago in the 2005 REAL ID Act amendment. The Section 102(c) waiver authority has \nCOMPLAINT  19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.56   Page 20 of 26\n \n1 not been further amended by Congress in the 12 years since its 2005 consideration and \n2 enactment, despite the extensive amendments to IIRIRA section 102(b) by the 2006 \n3 Secure Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The plain meaning of \n4 broadly allowing the waiver of any laws determined by the DHS Secretary as necessary \n5 to ensure the “expeditious construction” under Section 102(c) of IIRIRA was to provide \n6 the DHS Secretary with the authority to waive laws in order to build border barriers as \n7 soon as possible after the law’s enactment (i.e., the REAL ID Act of 2005 12 years ago). \n8 77.  This interpretation is further supported by Congress’s subsequent establishment of \n9 specific deadlines in its amendments to IIRIRA section 102(b) under the 2006 Secure \n10 Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act; most notably, its direction that at \n11 least 370 miles of border barriers be constructed by December 31, 2008, and its explicit \n12 termination of the Secretary’s authority to designate “priority areas” for such construction \n13 by that same date. IIRIRA § 102(b)(2)(A)-(B). \n14 78.  As such, the wall prototype project and border wall replacement project are not \n15 subject to the scope of the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver authority, and the San Diego \n16 and Calexico Waivers are unlawful ultra vires acts subject to review by this Court, and \n17 the restrictions on judicial review and appellate review under that subsection are \n18 inapplicable to that determination. \n19 79.  Since the San Diego and Calexico Waivers authorize activities that are beyond the \n20 scope of Section 102(c) of IRRIRA’s waiver provision, the Waivers are an unlawful ultra \n21 vires acts subject to review by this Court, and, moreover, Section 102(c)(2)’s restriction \n22 on judicial review are inapplicable to the San Diego and Calexico Waivers. \n23 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24 (Violation of Section 102(a) and 102(b)(1)(C)) \n25 80.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the foregoing paragraphs as \n26 though fully set forth herein. \n27 81.  Section 102(a) of IIRIRA requires the Secretary, prior to taking actions “to install \n28 additional physical barriers and roads,” under the authority of IIRIRA, to determine that \nCOMPLAINT  20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.57   Page 21 of 26\n \n1 locations where such installations are to take place are “areas of high illegal entry into the \n2 United States.” \n3 82.  Section 102(b)(1)(C) of IRRIRA requires the Secretary, prior to taking actions to \n4 carry out IIRIRA, to \n5 consult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, \nStates, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners in the United \n6\nStates to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, and \n7 quality of life for the communities and residents located near the sites at \nwhich such fencing is to be constructed. \n8\n9 83.  Neither the San Diego nor the Calexico Waiver included Section 102 of IIRIRA \n10 among the combined thirty-eight federal statutes waived by the Secretary. \n11 84.  Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA authorizes the Secretary to waive all legal \n12 requirements “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.” \n13 85.  Section 102 subparagraphs (a) and (b) are not “other provision[s] of law,” but are \n14 part of the same section of law granting the waiver authority.  \n15 86.  Furthermore, the restriction on judicial review in Section 102(c)(2)(A) of IIRIRA \n16 applies only to “any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of \n17 Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph [102(c)](1)… The court shall not have \n18 jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.” (Emphasis added.) \n19 87.  The requirements of Section 102 subparagraphs (a) and (b), in fact, are \n20 prerequisites to the Secretary using the waiver authority of Section 102(c). \n21 88.  The Secretary has failed to provide an explanation or reasoning for the August 2, \n22 2017 Waiver’s conclusion that “[t]he San Diego Sector remains an area of high illegal \n23 entry.”  \n24 89.  The Secretary has failed to provide an explanation or reasoning for the September \n25 12, 2017 Waiver’s conclusion that the “El Centro Sector is an area of high illegal entry.” \n26 90.  It is the Plaintiffs’ understanding and belief that the Secretary has not consulted \n27 with any or all of the entities required by Section 102(b)(1)(C) prior to either the San \n28 Diego or Calexico Waivers. \nCOMPLAINT  21 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.58   Page 22 of 26\n \n1 91.  The Secretary’s decisions the San Diego and El Centro Sectors are therefore \n2 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, and \n3 without observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n4 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5 (Violation of the U.S. Constitution, Art. I, § 7, Cls. 2 and 3) \n6 (The Presentment Clauses) \n7 92.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the foregoing paragraphs as \n8 though fully set forth herein.  \n9 93.  Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA, as amended, provides the Secretary “authority to \n10 waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, \n11 determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads” in the \n12 vicinity of the United States border. \n13 94.  The Secretary’s Calexico Waiver, issued pursuant to Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA, \n14 as amended, abrogates 28 enacted federal statutes and an undetermined number of \n15 “federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, or \n16 related to the subject of” those statutes. \n17 95.  Under Article I, Section 7, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, “Every Bill which \n18 shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n19 Law, be presented to the President of the United States.” \n20 96.  Under Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution, “Every Order, \n21 Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of \n22 Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be \n23 presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, \n24 shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of \n25 the Senate and House of Representatives.” \n26 97.  Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA provides the Secretary de facto repeal authority, \n27 allowing him to nullify validly enacted statutes without passing both the Senate and \n28 House of Representatives and without being presented to the President. \nCOMPLAINT  22 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.59   Page 23 of 26\n \n1 98.  Section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA is unconstitutional as it violates the lawmaking \n2 procedures set forth in the Presentment Clauses expressed in Article I, Section 7, Clauses \n3 2 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution. \n4 99.  The Secretary’s San Diego and Calexico Waivers made pursuant to Section \n5 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA violates the lawmaking procedures set forth in the Presentment \n6 Clauses expressed in Article I, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution. \n7 FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8 (Violation of the U.S. Constitution, Art. I, § 1 and Art. II § 1) \n9 (Nondelegation Doctrine) \n10 100.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the foregoing paragraphs as \n11 though fully set forth herein. \n12 101.  Article I, Section 1 if the U.S. Constitutions vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein \n13 granted … in a Congress of the United States.”  \n14 102.  “This text permits no delegation of those powers.” Whitman v. Am. Trucking \n15 Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (U.S. 2001). \n16 103.  Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution provides: “The executive Power shall be \n17 vested in a President of the United States of America.” \n18 104.  Section 102(c) of IIRIRA is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to \n19 an officer of the executive branch, in violation of Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. \n20 Constitution and the doctrine of Separation of Powers fundamental to our constitutional \n21 system. \n22 105.  The Secretary’s San Diego and Calexico Waivers made pursuant to Section \n23 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority by and officer \n24 of the executive branch, violates the lawmaking procedures set forth in the Presentment \n25 Clauses expressed in Article I, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution in \n26 violation of Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and the doctrine of Separation of \n27 Powers fundamental to our constitutional system. \n28\nCOMPLAINT  23 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01873-JM-AGS   Document 1   Filed 09/14/17   PageID.60   Page 24 of 26\n \n1 FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 (Violation of the U.S. Constitution, Art. III, § 1) \n3 (Judicial Power) \n4 106.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the foregoing paragraphs as \n5 though fully set forth herein. \n6 107.  Section 102(c)(2)(A) of IIRIRA, as amended, restricts judicial review by limiting \n7 “[a] cause of action or claim” arising from a waiver made pursuant to Section 102(c)(1) \n8 to “alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States.”    \n9 108.  Section 102(c)(2)(A), further provides that “[t]he court shall not have jurisdiction \n10 to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.” \n11 109.  Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution vests “[t]he judicial Power of the \n12 United States … in one supreme court.” \n13 110.  Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides: “The judicial Power shall \n14 extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the \n15 United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.” \n16 111.  Section 102(c)(2)(A) of IIRIRA, as amended, is an unconstitutional, ultra vires \n17 legislative infringement of the judicial Power expressed in Article III, Sections 1 and 2 of \n18 the U.S. Constitution and the doctrine of Separation of Powers fundamental to our \n19 constitutional system. \n20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n22 a.
