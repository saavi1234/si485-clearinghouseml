    "summary": "<p>This suit, filed on September 20, 2017, challenged President Trump's authorization of the construction of a border wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The plaintiffs sued the federal government for failing to comply with existing laws and taking actions beyond the scope of its authority. President Trump issued <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02095.pdf\">Executive Order (EO) 13767</a> on Jan. 25, 2017; it directed DHS to \"allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing and construction of a physical wall along the southern border.\" The EO cites as its authority the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). According to the complaint, IIRIRA \"allows the Secretary of DHS to waive any law he or she deems necessary to expeditiously construct reinforced fencing authorized under that section.\" The complaint asserted that DHS twice attempted to exercise this waiver on Aug. 2 and Sept. 12, 2017 with respect to portions of the California border pursuant to the EO. According to the complaint, DHS seeks to enforce the EO through the \"construction of a Border Wall, which includes but is not limited to the construction of prototype walls and fences, the construction of barriers and roads that are not in areas of high illegal entry, the construction of barriers that are not in areas where the fencing would be most practical and effective, and the replacement of existing walls and fencing along the United States-Mexico border.\"</p><p>In so doing, the complaint argued that DHS violated the National Environmental Policy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The complaint further argued that the IIRIRA waiver provision is \"limited to the installation of 'additional barriers and roads...in areas of high illegal entry,'\" and does not authorize replacement of existing barriers and roads, construction of temporary prototype walls, or the construction of barriers and roads in areas that are not \"of high illegal entry into the United States.\" Accordingly, the plaintiffs sought declaration that the IIRIRA waiver provision does not apply to DHS' proposed activities pursuant to the EO, that the two California waivers do not comply with the IIRIRA waiver provision, and that both the California waivers and the IIRIRA provision itself violate Fifth Amendment due process, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Tenth Amendment. </p><p>One plaintiff is the People of California, represented by the Attorney General. The suit sought to protect in particular California's natural resources, sovereign interests in enacting and enforcing state laws, and economic interests in trade and tourism with Mexico as well as property near the border. The other plaintiff is the California Coastal Commission, which is a state agency that implements the Coastal Zone Management Act in California. </p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Thomas J. Whelan, then reassigned to Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel on Oct. 5. The case was consolidated with two other cases on Oct. 24. The lead case, which will contain all future updates, is <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16180\">here</a>. Since there was a final judgment, the case is now closed.</p>",

The People bring this action to protect the State of California’s residents, \n6  natural resources, economic interests, procedural rights, and sovereignty from \n7  violations of the United States Constitution, the National Environmental Policy Act \n8  and the Administrative Procedure Act occurring as a result of the actions of the \n9  United States of America, the United States Department of Homeland Security \n10  (“DHS”), former DHS Secretary John Kelly in his official capacity, Acting DHS \n11  Secretary Elaine Duke in her official capacity, the United States Customs and \n12  Border Protection (“CBP”), and Acting CBP Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan \n13  in his official capacity (together “Defendants”), with respect to the planning and \n14  construction of a border wall and related border barrier projects along the southern \n15  border of the United States, including significant projects in California (“Border \n16  Wall” or “Border Wall Projects”).  The Commission brings this action to protect \n17  natural resources within California’s coastal zone, land and water uses within the \n18  coastal zone, and the Commission’s procedural rights from violations of the Coastal \n19  Zone Management Act and other statutes resulting from Defendants’ actions \n20  relating to the Border Wall. \n21  2.  As a presidential candidate, and subsequently as President, President \n22  Trump repeatedly has stated his intent to build a wall across the entire United States \n23  border with Mexico.  On January 25, 2017, he issued Executive Order No. 13767 \n24  concerning “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements” \n25  (“Executive Order”).  The Executive Order directs the Secretary of DHS to identify \n26  and “allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing and \n27  construction of a physical wall along the southern border.”   \n28 \n  2   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.3   Page 3 of 53\n \n1  3.  The Executive Order cites the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n2  Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) (Pub. L. 104–208; 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note) as \n3  authority for the construction of the Border Wall.  As amended by the Real ID Act \n4  of 2005 (Pub. L. 109–13), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109–367), and the \n5  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008 (Pub. L. 110-161), \n6  Section 102 of IIRIRA authorizes the Secretary of DHS to install “additional” \n7  physical barriers along the United States border to deter illegal crossings in “areas \n8  of high illegal entry” into the United States “along not less than 700 miles of the \n9  southwest border.”  8 U.S.C. section 1103 note.  IIRIRA also required the Secretary \n10  to identify 370 miles of “priority areas” and it imposed a deadline to construct \n11  reinforced fencing in those areas by no later than December 31, 2008.  8 U.S.C. \n12  section 1103 note. \n13  4.  Since 2006, under the Congressional authority granted to it, DHS \n14  installed hundreds of miles of reinforced fencing along the US-Mexico border.  \n15  There are currently 702 miles of primary, secondary and tertiary fencing along \n16  approximately 654 miles of the border.  This includes primary pedestrian and/or \n17  vehicle barriers along most of the 140.4-mile-long border within California, and \n18  multiple layers of reinforced fencing along a 14-mile segment of the western end of \n19  the border in San Diego County.  The Secretary of DHS also identified “priority \n20  areas” for expedited construction pursuant to the requirements of the provision.  In \n21  April 2008, the Secretary last exercised his authority to waive federal laws.  DHS \n22  completed all of the “priority areas” projects authorized by Congress under Section \n23  102.  By doing so, the DHS completed its task as envisioned and authorized in \n24  Section 102 of IIRIRA.  8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, subdivision (b)(1).   \n25  5.  In 2017, DHS announced that initial construction of Border Wall projects \n26  will occur in Naco, Arizona; Sunland Park, New Mexico; San Diego County, \n27  California; Imperial County, California; El Paso, Texas; and, the Rio Grande \n28  Valley, Texas.  With respect to San Diego County, DHS announced that, pursuant \n  3   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.4   Page 4 of 53\n \n1  to the Executive Order, it intends to replace 14 miles of existing primary fencing \n2  with new fencing and to replace 14 miles of existing secondary fencing with a solid \n3  wall or other barrier.  DHS has also solicited and received design bids from \n4  contractors seeking to design and build the Border Wall, and has announced that \n5  selected contractors will build prototypes of their Border Wall designs in San Diego \n6  County, as part of the bidding process. \n7  6.  Section 102 of IIRIRA contains a provision that allows the Secretary of \n8  DHS to waive any law he or she deems necessary to expeditiously construct \n9  reinforced fencing authorized under that section.  8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, subdivision \n10  (c).  On August 2, 2017, former Secretary John Kelly attempted to exercise this \n11  waiver authority by publishing a Notice of Determination in the Federal Register.  \n12  Determination pursuant to Section 102 of [IIRIRA], as Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 35 \n13  984 (August 2, 2017) (“San Diego Waiver”).  The San Diego Waiver states “DHS \n14  will immediately implement various border infrastructure projects” within the \n15  “Project Area.”  Id.  The Project Area is described as a fifteen-mile segment of the \n16  border within the United States Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector beginning at the \n17  Pacific Ocean and extending eastward.  The only infrastructure projects specifically \n18  identified in the San Diego Waiver are the replacement of 14 miles of existing \n19  primary fencing and the construction of prototype border walls (hereinafter “San \n20  Diego Project”).  Id.  The San Diego Waiver purports to waive more than 30 federal \n21  laws, as well as all state and local laws derived or related thereto, to expedite the \n22  construction of all of the “various border infrastructure projects” that DHS intends \n23  to build within the Project Area. \n24  7.  On September 12, 2017, Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke attempted to \n25  exercise Section 102’s waiver provision with respect to the proposed replacement \n26  of fencing in another area of California by publishing a Notice of Determination in \n27  the Federal Register.  Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of IIRIRA, as \n28  Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 42829 (September 12, 2017) (“Calexico Waiver”).  The \n  4   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.5   Page 5 of 53\n \n1  Calexico Waiver states that “DHS will take immediate action to replace existing \n2  primary fencing” along a segment of the border that starts near the Calexico West \n3  Land Port of Entry and extends three miles to the west.  (“Calexico Project”). The \n4  Calexico Waiver purports to waive 27 federal laws, as well as all state and local \n5  laws derived from or related thereto, to expedite the fence replacement project. \n6  8.  In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs challenge \n7  Defendants’ failure to comply with the requirements of the National Environmental \n8  Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et. seq. (1970) as amended (“NEPA”) the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et. seq. (1946) as amended (“APA”), \n10  and the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et. seq. (1972) as \n11  amended (“CZMA”).  The Plaintiffs request the Court enjoin DHS from engaging \n12  in any and all planning, design and construction activities related to installing \n13  barriers along the United States-Mexico border, including the construction of \n14  prototypes, and all other infrastructure plans referenced in the San Diego and \n15  Calexico Waivers, until DHS fully complies with these laws. \n16  9.  Plaintiffs also seek a judicial declaration by this Court that Section 102 of \n17  IIRIRA, the provision cited in the Executive Order, does not apply to DHS’s \n18  proposed construction of a Border Wall, which includes but is not limited to the \n19  construction of prototype walls and fences, the construction of barriers and roads \n20  that are not in areas of high illegal entry, the construction of barriers that are not in \n21  areas where the fencing would be most practical and effective, and the replacement \n22  of existing walls and fencing along the United States-Mexico border.   \n23  10.  Plaintiffs also seek a judicial declaration by this Court that the San Diego \n24  and Calexico Waivers fail to meet the requirements of Section 102 of IIRIRA, that \n25  former Secretary DHS Kelly and Acting DHS Secretary Duke acted outside of their \n26  statutory authority in issuing the waivers, and that both waivers are invalid and \n27  ineffective.  The waivers are invalid because the described projects do not involve \n28  the installation of “additional” fencing or the construction of barriers in areas of \n  5   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.6   Page 6 of 53\n \n1  high illegal entry, and are not located where additional fencing would be most \n2  practical and effective.  The San Diego and Calexico waivers are also invalid \n3  because Defendants are attempting to rely on a provision relating to expeditious \n4  construction 10 years after the statute was last amended and nine years after the \n5  authority to waive laws for expedited construction in priority areas expired. \n6  11.  Additionally, Plaintiffs seek an order declaring the San Diego and \n7  Calexico Waivers are improper and unconstitutional in that they attempt to waive \n8  laws to expedite the construction of undisclosed projects, denying Plaintiffs and \n9  other parties a reasonable opportunity to determine if the undisclosed projects are \n10  authorized by Section 102 and how the undisclosed projects might impact their \n11  interests. \n12  12.  Finally, Plaintiffs seek an order declaring Section 102 to be \n13  unconstitutional on both its face and as applied, and invalidating Section 102, the \n14  portion of the Executive Order that authorizes the use of Section 102 to build the \n15  Border Wall and the San Diego and Calexico Projects, and the San Diego and \n16  Calexico Waivers. \n17  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18  13.  This Court has jurisdiction because this action arises under the United \n19  States Constitution pursuant to Article I, Article III, and the Fifth and Tenth \n20  Amendments of the United States Constitution, and also pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n21  1331 and 1346, and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 to 706.   \n22  14.  An actual, present and justiciable controversy exists between the parties \n23  within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and this Court has authority to grant \n24  declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1651, 2201 and 2202, and 5 \n25  U.S.C. §§ 705 and 706.   \n26  15.  The People have been granted a right to sue under the APA and NEPA \n27  because they fall within the APA’s broad definition of a “person . . . adversely \n28  affected or aggrieved by agency action. . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 702; see also 5 U.S.C. § \n  6   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.7   Page 7 of 53\n \n1  551(2).  The People and the Commission have also been granted the right to sue for \n2  violations of the CZMA.  5 U.S.C. § 702; see also, State of California v. Norton, \n3  311 F.3d 1162, 1170 (9th Cir. 2002). \n4  16.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \n5  because all parties have offices within this district and therefore reside in this \n6  district, because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \n7  claims occurred in this district, and/or a substantial part of the property that is the \n8  subject of the action is situated in this district. Moreover, other cases that relate to \n9  Defendants’ Border Wall projects have been filed in this judicial district.  \n10  PARTIES \n11  17.  The People of the State of California, as plaintiff, bring this action by and \n12  through Xavier Becerra, Attorney General of the State of California.  Attorney \n13  General Becerra is the chief law officer of the State of California and has the \n14  authority to file civil actions in order to protect the People’s rights and interests, the \n15  environment, and the natural resources of this State.  Cal. Const., art V, § 13, Cal. \n16  Gov. Code §§ 12600-12612, 12511-12512. This challenge is brought pursuant to \n17  the Attorney General’s independent constitutional, common law, and statutory \n18  authority.  In this case, the interest the Attorney General seeks to advance and \n19  protect is not limited to a parens patriae interest in the general welfare of \n20  California’s citizens, but rather encompasses California’s procedural interests, \n21  interests in the specific natural resources of this State - such as wildlife, fish, and \n22  water - that are held in trust by the State for the People, economic interests in \n23  maintaining tourism and trade with Mexico, economic interests relating to the \n24  management of real property adjacent to the border, and sovereign interests in \n25  enacting and enforcing its own laws. \n26  18.  The Commission is a state agency designated as the agency responsible \n27  for implementing the CZMA within California’s coastal zone and developing state \n28  programs designed to meet the goals of the CZMA.  American Petroleum Institute \n  7   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.8   Page 8 of 53\n \n1  v. Knecht, 609 F.2d 1306 (9th Cir. 1979); Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 30008, 30330.  \n2  The Commission has jurisdictional and procedural interests in ensuring that \n3  activities within or affecting California’s coastal zone will not negatively affect any \n4  land or water uses within the coastal zone or negatively affect any natural resources \n5  within the coastal zone. \n6  19.  Defendant United States of America is responsible for enacting and \n7  enforcing laws that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States. \n8  20.  Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is the federal \n9  agency responsible for providing border security along the U.S.-Mexico border in a \n10  manner that is consistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States.   \n11  21.  Defendant Elaine Duke, the Acting Secretary of DHS, is responsible for \n12  the actions and decisions that are being challenged by Plaintiffs in this action and is \n13  sued in her official capacity. \n14  22.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is a federal \n15  agency within DHS responsible for implementing the actions and decisions being \n16  challenged by Plaintiffs in this action. \n17  23.  Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan, the Acting Commissioner of CBP, is \n18  responsible for implementing the actions and decisions being challenged by \n19  Plaintiffs in this action and is sued in his official capacity. \n20  SUMMARY OF THE LAW \n21  I.  NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (“NEPA”) \n22  24.  NEPA is the “basic national charter for protection of the environment.”  \n23  40 C.F.R. § 1500. l (a).  It was enacted with the ambitious objectives of \n24  “encouraging productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment \n25  . . . promoting efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment \n26  and biosphere and stimulating the health and welfare of man; and enriching the \n27  understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the \n28  Nation. . .” 42 U.S.C. 4321. \n  8   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.9   Page 9 of 53\n \n1  25.  In order to achieve these goals, NEPA contains several “action forcing” \n2  procedures, most significantly the mandate to prepare an environmental impact \n3  statement (“EIS”) on major federal actions “significantly affecting the quality of the \n4  human environment.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizen Council, 490 U.S. 332, \n5  348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2)(C). \n6  26.  The Supreme Court has found that the preparation of an EIS promotes \n7  NEPA's broad environmental objectives in two primary ways:  “It ensures that the \n8  agency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, \n9  detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts; it also \n10  guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger \n11  audience that may also play a role in both the decision making process and the \n12  implementation of that decision.”  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349. \n13  27.  NEPA mandates disclosure and consideration of direct, indirect, and \n14  cumulative environmental effects.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.16, 1508.7, 1508.8, \n15  l508.27(b)(7). \n16  28.  Direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and \n17  place as the proposed project.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(a).  Indirect effects are caused by \n18  the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still \n19  reasonably foreseeable.  40 C.F.R. § l 508.8(b).  These effects include “ecological \n20  (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and \n21  functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, \n22  or health whether direct, indirect, or cumulative.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8. \n23  29.  In determining whether a federal action significantly affects the quality of \n24  the human environment, federal agencies must consider several factors relating to \n25  the “intensity” of the project, including: the “[u]nique characteristics of the \n26  geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands . . .  \n27  wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas” (40 C.F.R. § \n28  1508.27(3)); “[t]he degree to which the effects on the quality of the human \n  9   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.10   Page 10 of 53\n \n1  environment are likely to be highly controversial” (40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(4));  \n2  “[w]hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but \n3  cumulatively significant impacts” (40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(7));  “[t]he degree to which \n4  the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat \n5  that has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973” \n6  (40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(9)); and, “[w]hether the action threatens a violation of \n7  Federal, State, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the \n8  environment.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(10).   \n9  30.  A proposal subject to NEPA exists where an agency has a goal and is \n10  actively preparing to make a decision on the alternatives in accomplishing that goal, \n11  regardless of whether the agency declares that such a proposal exists: “An agency \n12  shall commence preparation of an environmental impact statement as close as \n13  possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal.”  40 \n14  C.F.R. § 1502.5.  A “Proposal exists at that stage in the development of an action \n15  when an agency subject to the Act has a goal and is actively preparing to make a \n16  decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the \n17  effects can be meaningfully evaluated.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.23. \n18  31.  An EIS must include a statement of purpose and need to which the \n19  agency is responding, an analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives and a \n20  comparison of their environmental impacts, an analysis of affected areas and \n21  resources, and an assessment of the environmental consequences of the proposed \n22  action and alternatives (including direct, indirect and cumulative effects on the \n23  environment.)  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.10-1502.19. \n24  32.  An EIS is prepared in two stages.  A draft EIS must be prepared first and \n25  then published in order to obtain comments from the public and from governmental \n26  agencies.  Following a period of public comment, the federal agency must then \n27  prepare a final EIS that responds to all comments received on the draft EIS.  40 \n28  C.F.R. § 1503. \n  10   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.11   Page 11 of 53\n \n1  33.  “The purpose of an EIS is to apprise decision makers of the disruptive \n2  environmental effects that may flow from their decisions at a time when they ‘retain \n3  [ ] a maximum range of options.’”  Conner v. Burford, 848 F.2d 1441, 1446 (9th \n4  Cir. 1988.)  Thus, “NEPA requires that the evaluation of a project’s environmental \n5  consequences take place at an early stage in the project’s planning process.  State of \n6  California v. Block, 690 F.2d 753, 761 (9th Cir. 1982) [citation omitted].  “The \n7  statement shall be prepared early enough so that it can serve practically as an \n8  important contribution to the decision making process and will not be used to \n9  rationalize or justify decisions already made.”  40 C.F.R. § 1502.5.   \n10  34.  The People have a concrete and particularized interest in protecting “the \n11  State of California’s territory and its proprietary interests both from direct harm and \n12  from spill-over effects resulting from action on federal land.”  Sierra Forest Legacy \n13  v. Sherman, 646 F.3d 1161, 1178 (9th Cir. 2011.)  The construction of a Border \n14  Wall, prototypes for a Border Wall, and /or replacement fencing of a different type \n15  than the current fencing would have such direct and spill-over effects. \n16  II.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (“APA”) \n17  35.  The APA provides for judicial review of “final agency action for which \n18  there is no other adequate remedy.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Agency action is defined to \n19  include “the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \n20  equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  The APA \n21  requires that courts “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \n22  conclusions” that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \n23  in accordance with law, or without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 \n24  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n25  36.  In reviewing a challenge to an agency’s failure to act, the APA directs \n26  that the court “shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \n27  delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  \n28   \n  11   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.12   Page 12 of 53\n \n1  III.  THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT (“CZMA”)  \n2  37.  The Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”) is a federal law intended \n3  to “preserve, protect, develop and where possible, to restore and enhance the \n4  resources of the nation’s coastal zone.”  16 U.S.C. § 1452.   \n5  38.  The CZMA authorizes states to designate a “State Agency” responsible \n6  for implementing the CZMA within that particular state’s coastal zone and to \n7  develop state programs designed to meet the goals of the CZMA.  The California \n8  Coastal Act designates the California Coastal Commission (“Commission”) as the \n9  “state agency” responsible for implementing the CZMA over California’s ocean \n10  coastline.  Cal. Pub. Resources Code §§ 30300 et seq. \n11  39.  The Commission developed the California Coastal Management Program \n12  (“CCMP”) in order to achieve that goal.  16 U.S.C. § 1454(c); Cal. Pub. Resources \n13  Code § 30330.  The federal government approved the CCMP in 1977 as compliant \n14  with the requirements of the CZMA.   \n15  40.  Federal approval of the CCMP triggered the consistency requirements of \n16  the CZMA.  When a federal agency undertakes an activity, occurring inside or \n17  outside the coastal zone, that affects directly or indirectly any land or water uses or \n18  natural resources of the California coastal zone, the CZMA requires that the agency \n19  must provide a “consistency determination” to the Commission.  16 U.S.C. \n20  § 1456(c)(1)(A).  The consistency determination must include a statement \n21  indicating that the federal action will be undertaken in a manner that is consistent to \n22  the maximum extent practicable with the CCMP.  16 U.S.C. § 1456(C)(2); 15 \n23  C.F.R. 930.32, 930.39.  Alternatively, the federal agency may prepare a negative \n24  determination if the agency determines that the project will not affect any coastal \n25  use or resource.   \n26  41.  The federal agency proposing a development project is required to \n27  provide the Commission with a “consistency determination” or “negative \n28  determination” “at the earliest practicable time in the planning” of the development \n  12   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.13   Page 13 of 53\n \n1  project.  15 C.F.R. § 930.36.  “A consistency determination should be prepared \n2  following the development of sufficient information to reasonably determine the \n3  consistency of the activity with the management program, but before the Federal \n4  agency reaches a significant point of decision making in its review process, i.e., \n5  while the Federal agency has the ability to modify the activity.”  15 C.F.R. \n6  § 930.36(b).  \n7  42.   The Commission is entitled to review the federal agency’s consistency \n8  determination and may file objections to the determination and/or seek additional \n9  information from the agency regarding its determination.  15 C.F.R. §§ 930.39 - \n10  930.42.  The Commission is further entitled to request mediation by the Secretary \n11  of Commerce if the dispute cannot be resolved and/or seek judicial review.  15 \n12  C.F.R. § 930.116.  If a federal agency decides to carry out an activity despite a \n13  Commission objection, the Commission is entitled to seek judicial review pursuant \n14  to the APA.  State of California v. Norton, 311 F.3d 1162, 1170 (9th Cir. 2002). \n15  IV.  SECTION 102 OF IIRIRA \n16  43.  Section 4 of the Executive Order relies upon Section 102 of IIRIRA as \n17  the legal basis for replacing border fences.  82 Fed. Reg. 8793. \n18  44.  Before 1996, there was no express statutory authority that permitted or \n19  required construction of barriers along U.S. borders.  That changed when Congress \n20  passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n21  (Pub. L. 104-208).  Section 102 of IIRIRA authorized the U.S. Attorney General, in \n22  consultation with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, to “take \n23  such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and       \n24  roads . . . in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in \n25  areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”  Id. § 102(a).  Section 102 also \n26  required construction of second and third fences parallel to a 14-mile segment of \n27  primary fencing installed a few years earlier along the border near San Diego.  The \n28  14-mile segment starts at the Pacific Ocean and extends 14 miles east.  Id. § 102(b).  \n  13   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.14   Page 14 of 53\n \n1  Further, Section 102 contained a provision that permitted the Attorney General to \n2  waive application of the ESA and NEPA “to the extent the Attorney General \n3  determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n4  under this section.”  Id. § 102(c). \n5  45.  The Real ID Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-113 Div. B) amended Section 102 \n6  of IIRIRA by transferring the waiver authority from the Attorney General to the \n7  Secretary of Homeland Security, and expanding the waiver authority to include “all \n8  legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, determines \n9  necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \n10  section.”  Section 102 did not specify the laws that Congress authorized the \n11  Secretary to waive.  It also limited legal challenges to any waiver decision to \n12  constitutional claims, and eliminated appellate court review. \n13  46.  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-367) amended Section 102 of \n14  IIRIRA again by removing the provisions referring specifically to the 14-miles of \n15  fencing in San Diego, and instead directing DHS to construct two layers of \n16  reinforced fencing along five separate segments of the border, totaling more than \n17  800 miles. \n18  47.  The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008 (Pub. \n19  L. 110-161) (“2008 Amendment”) amended Section 102 a third and final time by \n20  removing requirements for doubled-layered fencing in specific locations, and by \n21  directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct reinforced fencing along \n22  not less than 700 miles of the border where it would be most practical and effective.  \n23  The 2008 Amendment also amended the statute by striking the phrase “Security \n24  Features” from the heading for subdivision (b)(1) and replacing it with the phrase \n25  “Additional Fencing Along Southwest Border.”   \n26  48.  The 2008 Amendment also amended the statute by compelling the \n27  Secretary of Homeland Security to designate “Priority Areas” for 370 miles of \n28  additional fencing, and by compelling the Secretary to expedite the construction of \n  14   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.15   Page 15 of 53\n \n1  said fencing in these “priority areas,” requiring the completion of construction by \n2  not later than December 31, 2008.  (Pub. L. 110-161.).  Thus, Congress imposed a \n3  December 31, 2008 deadline for the expedited construction of additional barriers \n4  and roads in priority areas under Section 102.   \n5  49.  There have been no amendments to Section 102 of IIRIRA since the \n6  2008 Amendment was signed into law. \n7    Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 102 currently state that: \n8  (a)  In General.  — The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \ntake such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical \n9  barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of \nillegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter \n10  illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States. \n11  (b)  Construction of Fencing and Road Improvements Along the \nBorder.—  \n12 \n    (1)  Additional fencing along southwest border.—  \n13 \n(A)  Reinforced fencing.— In carrying out subsection (a), the \n14  Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced fencing along \nnot less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be \n15  most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional \nphysical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain \n16  operational control of the southwest border. \n17  (B)  Priority areas. — In carrying out this section, the Secretary \nof Homeland Security shall — \n18 \n(i)  identify the 370 miles, or other mileage determined \n19  by the Secretary, whose authority to determine other mileage \nshall expire on December 31, 2008, along the southwest border \n20  where fencing would be most practical and effective in deterring \nsmugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the \n21  United States; and  \n22  (ii)  not later than December 31, 2008, complete \nconstruction of reinforced fencing along the miles \n23  identified under clause (i). \n24  50.  Subsection (c) of Section 102 further states “Notwithstanding any other \n25  provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to \n26  waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, \n27  determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n28 \n  15   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.16   Page 16 of 53\n \n1  under this section.”  The section is limited to the installation of “additional barriers \n2  and roads . . . in areas of high illegal entry.”  Section 102(a). \n3  51.  Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the replacement of existing \n4  barriers or roads along the southwest border. \n5  52.  Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the construction of temporary \n6  prototype walls along the southwest border. \n7  53.  Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the construction of barriers and \n8  roads along the southwest border other than in “areas of high illegal entry into the \n9  United States” and in areas where the barriers would be most practical and \n10  effective. \n11  54.  Section 102 of IIRIRA imposed a deadline on the Secretary’s authority to \n12  identify and construct reinforced fencing in “priority areas” by no later than \n13  December 31, 2008.     \n14  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n15  I.  EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER  \n16  55.  Between 1990 and 1993, the United States constructed 10-foot-high solid \n17  steel fencing along a 14-mile segment of the border in San Diego County, with its \n18  western end beginning at the Pacific Ocean.  This section of fencing, which was \n19  placed directly on the U.S.-Mexico border, is referred to as the San Diego primary \n20  fence.  \n21  56.   In 1994, USBP enacted a program known as “Operation Gatekeeper,” \n22  which included a large increase in the number of border patrol agents and other \n23  resources deployed to the San Diego Sector.  Over a four-year period, the number \n24  of agents assigned to the San Diego sector increased by 150% and the number of \n25  seismic sensors increased by 171%.    \n26  57.  In 1996, former INS began construction of a multi-tiered fencing project \n27  in the western-most portion of the San Diego sector.  The project, which was \n28  initially referred to as the Triple-Fence Project and later known as the 14-Mile \n  16   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.17   Page 17 of 53\n \n1  Border Infrastructure Project (“14-Mile BIS”), called for the construction of new \n2  secondary and tertiary fencing that would parallel the existing, San Diego primary \n3  fence.     \n4  58.  The entire 14-Mile BIS fell within the watershed of the Tijuana River, a \n5  river that culminates in the United States where the Tijuana River estuary meets the \n6  Pacific Ocean.  The western-most 4.5 miles of the 14-Mile BIS abuts the Tijuana \n7  River National Estuarine Research Reserve (“Tijuana Reserve”), the County of San \n8  Diego’s Tijuana Valley Regional Park, and the State of California’s Border Field \n9  State Park.  The United States Fish and Wildlife Service and other federal, state and \n10  local governmental entities reported that the 14-Mile BIS would result in the taking \n11  of several endangered plant and animal species, the destruction of critical habitat \n12  and the degradation of impaired bodies of water.    \n13  59.   In September 2005, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff executed a \n14  waiver, pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 102 of IIRIRA, seeking to waive all \n15  federal and state “legal requirements deriving from or related to the subject of” \n16  several laws, including NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the APA, the CZMA, \n17  and the Clean Water Act.  The waiver referred specifically to the expedited \n18  construction of a “second and third fence” extending eastward from the Pacific \n19  Ocean as set forth in the original version of IIRIRA.  70 Fed. Reg. 55622.  \n20  60.  The 14-Mile BIS Project was completed in 2009, approximately, \n21  consisting of secondary fencing that parallels the pre-existing primary fencing \n22  installed in the early 1990s.  The 14-Mile Border Infrastructure Project also \n23  includes tertiary fencing to the north of the secondary fence in selected locations.  \n24  Currently, as a result of the 14-Mile BIS, there are at least two fences along a 14-\n25  mile segment of the border beginning at the Pacific Ocean and extending eastward.  \n26  In 2009, the Government Accountability Office projected that the cost of the final \n27  4.5 miles of the project was $96 million, roughly $21 million per mile. \n28 \n  17   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.18   Page 18 of 53\n \n1  61.  Construction of the 14-Mile BIS resulted in the destruction of sensitive \n2  upland and wetland habitats, the taking of endangered plant and animal species, the \n3  spread of invasive plant species, and the increase in sedimentation within Border \n4  Field State Park and the Tijuana Reserve.  These areas have also been designated as \n5  Federally critical and/or sensitive habitats.   \n6  62.  DHS relied on Section 102’s waiver provision to expedite the \n7  construction of additional primary pedestrian fencing and primary vehicle fencing \n8  in other parts of California, as well as in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.   \n9  63.  The Secretary of DHS invoked the waiver authority conferred in Section \n10  102 five times during the period of September 2005 through April 2008, in \n11  relatively close succession following amendments to Section 102 of IIRIRA during \n12  that same time period.  70 Fed. Reg. 55622; 72 Fed. Reg. 2535; 72 Fed. Reg. \n13  60870; 73 Fed. Reg. 19077; 73 Fed. Reg. 19078. \n14  64.  Each waiver related to particular border infrastructure projects at specific \n15  areas along the border and was used to expedite the construction of additional \n16  fencing or roads that did not previously exist; none was used to authorize the \n17  expedited replacement of pre-existing barriers.  70 Fed. Reg. 55622; 72 Fed. Reg. \n18  2535; 72 Fed. Reg. 60870; 73 Fed. Reg. 19077; 73 Fed. Reg. 19078. \n19  65.  Former DHS Secretary Chertoff waived 36 federal laws as well as state \n20  laws and regulations derived from or relating to several federal statutes.  These laws \n21  included NEPA, ESA, Coastal Zone Management Act, Resource Conservation and \n22  Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act.  70 Fed. Reg. 55622; 72 Fed. Reg. 2535; \n23  72 Fed. Reg. 60870; 73 Fed. Reg. 19077; 73 Fed. Reg. 19078.  Two of the waivers \n24  were used to waive laws enacted by the State of California.  70 Fed. Reg. 55622; 73 \n25  Fed. Reg. 19078.  \n26  66.  In 2008, before the December 31, 2008 deadline established by the 2008 \n27  Amendment, former Secretary Chertoff identified more than 370 miles of priority \n28  areas for expedited construction and committed DHS to completing a total of 661 \n  18   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.19   Page 19 of 53\n \n1  miles of border fencing by the first half of 2009.  Former Secretary Chertoff issued \n2  waivers April 2008 to complete this construction.  73 Fed. Reg. 19077; 73 Fed. \n3  Reg. 19078. \n4  67.  Currently, there are 702 miles of fencing along 654 miles of the U.S.-\n5  Mexico border.  This includes CBP’s installation of 37 miles of secondary fencing \n6  and 14 miles of tertiary fencing, completing the goal of 700 miles as contemplated \n7  in IIRIRA.  \n8  II.  THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE BORDER WALL \nPROJECT INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF PROTOTYPES, THE \n9  REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING FENCES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF \nADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN SELECTED LOCATIONS \n10 \n11  68.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. \n12  13767 authorizing the Secretary of Homeland Security to “take all appropriate steps \n13  to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern \n14  border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve \n15  complete operational control of the southern border.”  The Executive Order defines \n16  the term “wall” as “a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, \n17  contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.”  The Executive Order does not \n18  distinguish between “areas of high illegal entry” and other areas of the southwest \n19  border, nor does it direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify “priority \n20  areas” for construction. 82 Fed. Reg. 8793.  The Executive Order cites the \n21  Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and Section 102 of IIRIRA \n22  as authority for the project.  82 Fed. Reg. 8793. \n23  69.  In March 2017, DHS solicited design proposals for two different types of \n24  barriers, one a reinforced concrete wall and the other an unspecified barrier.  DHS \n25  announced that it selected contractors to construct prototypes of their designs in the \n26  Otay Mesa area of San Diego County, in an area approximately 120 feet from the \n27  U.S. border.  Construction of these prototypes is scheduled to commence in the fall \n28  of 2017. \n  19   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.20   Page 20 of 53\n \n1  70.  On May 2, 2017, at a joint White House press briefing featuring former \n2  Secretary Kelly and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, \n3  Mr. Mulvaney stated that DHS is complying with the Executive Order and fulfilling \n4  President Trump’s promise to build a Border Wall by replacing existing border \n5  fence in selected locations with a “steel wall.”  He acknowledged that these \n6  replacement activities did not constitute the installation of “new” barriers. \n7  71.  DHS has already determined the location of portions of the proposed \n8  Border Wall project.  On May 3, 2017, former White House Press Secretary Sean \n9  Spicer stated that as part of President Trump’s commitment to “building a wall,” \n10  the administration is currently engaged in projects to replace existing fencing with \n11  new “bollard walls” in Naco, Arizona and Sunland Park, New Mexico.  Mr. Spicer \n12  further stated that the administration would begin its replacement of existing fences \n13  in “San Diego, El Paso and Rio Grande Valley.”     \n14  72.  On June 13, 2017, Border Patrol chief Carla Provost testified at a \n15  Congressional hearing that four to eight prototypes will be built in the San Diego \n16  and Rio Grande Valley areas beginning in late summer 2017.  Ms. Provost also \n17  confirmed that forty miles of fencing will be replaced in San Diego, El Paso, and El \n18  Centro. \n19  73.  In addition to these publicized aspects of the Border Wall project, \n20  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that DHS is currently engaged in the grading of \n21  and widening of dirt roads in areas along the border, including areas containing \n22  sensitive biological resources in east San Diego County, as part of the Border Wall \n23  project.  DHS is engaged in this activity despite the fact that DHS failed to comply \n24  with the requirements of NEPA. \n25  III.  THE SAN DIEGO AND CALEXICO WAIVERS \n26  74.  The San Diego Waiver was published in the Federal Register on August \n27  2, 2017.  82 Fed. Reg. 35,984.  The summary of the San Diego Waiver states that \n28  “[t]he Secretary of Homeland Security has determined, pursuant to law, that it is \n  20   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.21   Page 21 of 53\n \n1  necessary to waive certain laws, regulations and other legal requirements in order to \n2  ensure the expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the \n3  international land border of the United States near the city of San Diego in the state \n4  of California.”  Id. \n5  75.  The San Diego Waiver further states the Secretary’s finding that the area \n6  “[s]tarting at the Pacific Ocean and extending to approximately one mile east of \n7  Border Monument 251” is “an area of high illegal entry,” that “[t]here is presently a \n8  need to construct physical barriers and roads, including the infrastructure projects” \n9  described earlier in the waiver, and that he has determined it necessary to “exercise \n10  the authority that is vested in me by Section 102(c) of IIRIRA as amended.”  Id. \n11  76.  The San Diego Waiver purports to waive “in their entirety, with respect \n12  to the construction of roads and physical barriers . . . in the Project Area, the \n13  following statutes, including all federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal \n14  requirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of, the following statutes, \n15  as amended: The National Environmental Policy Act (Pub.

The Calexico Waiver was published in the Federal Register on September \n2  12, 2017.  82 Fed. Reg. 42,829.  Relying on language that mimics the San Diego \n3  Waiver, the summary of the Calexico Waiver states that “[t]he Secretary of \n4  Homeland Security has determined, pursuant to law, that it is necessary to waive \n5  certain laws, regulations and other legal requirements in order to ensure the \n6  expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the international \n7  land border of the United States near the city of Calexico in the state of California.”  \n8  Id. \n9  78.  The Calexico Waiver states that the El Centro Sector, which includes the \n10  portion of the border near the City of Calexico, “remains an area of high illegal \n11  entry for which there is an immediate need to construct border barriers and roads.”  \n12  The Calexico Waiver further states that “[t]o begin to meet the need for enhanced \n13  border infrastructure in the El Centro Sector, DHS will take immediate action to \n14  replace existing primary fencing” along a three-mile segment of the border \n15  extending westward from the Calexico West Land Port of Entry. \n16  79.  The Calexico Waiver purports to waive “in their entirety, with respect to \n17  the construction of roads and physical barriers . . . in the Project Area, the following \n18  statutes, including all federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal \n19  requirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of,” 27 federal statutes, the \n20  majority of which were also included in the San Diego Waiver. \n21  IV.  THE FENCE REPLACEMENT AND PROTOTYPE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS \nDO NOT CONSTITUTE “ADDITIONAL BARRIERS,” WILL NOT BE \n22  INSTALLED IN “AREAS OF HIGH ILLEGAL ENTRY,” AND WILL NOT BE \nINSTALLED IN AREAS WHERE ADDITIONAL FENCING WOULD BE MOST \n23  PRACTICAL OR EFFECTIVE \n24  80.  The CBP divides the southwest border into nine sectors.  The United \n25  States Border Patrol (“USBP”), which is responsible for securing the border \n26  between ports of entry, maintains data on the number of deportable migrants \n27  apprehended crossing the border (between the ports of entry) in each of the nine \n28  sectors.  The apprehension data is regarded as the primary indicator of immigration  \n  23   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.24   Page 24 of 53\n \n1  enforcement and the number of apprehensions is widely understood to correlate \n2  with the number of unauthorized entries.    \n3  81.   President Trump’s assertion that there has been a “recent surge of illegal \n4  immigration along the southwest border” is inaccurate.  Apprehension data \n5  published by the USBP indicates that the number of migrants apprehended by \n6  USBP while crossing the southwest border without authorization has fallen sharply \n7  since 2000, and particularly since 2006.1  In a September 2017 report published by \n8  DHS and the Office of Immigration Statistics, DHS admits that the number of \n9  southwest border apprehensions in 2016 was 75% lower than it was in 2000.2  The \n10  report also estimates that there was a 91% reduction in the number of successful \n11  illegal entries during that same time period.  Id.  According to DHS, “the southwest \n12  land border is more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before.”  Id.  In fact, \n13  DHS admits that illegal entries along the southwest border are at their lowest levels \n14  “since 2000, and likely since the early 1970s.”  Id. \n15  82.  In particular, from FY 2000 to FY 2016, there have been sharp declines \n16  in the number of deportable migrants apprehended by the USBP in the San Diego, \n17  El Centro and other sectors.  The San Diego and El Centro sectors are located \n18  within California’s geographic boundaries and the most western of the CBP’s nine \n19  border sectors.  The USBP’s apprehension data indicates there were 151,681 \n20  deportable migrants apprehended in the San Diego sector during FY 2000 \n21  compared with 31,891 apprehended during FY 2016, a reduction of 79%.  In the El \n22  Centro sector there were 238,126 deportable migrants apprehended in FY 2000 \n23  compared with 19,448 in FY 2016, a reduction of nearly 92%.  Of the total number \n24  of deportable migrants that were apprehended by the USBP along the southwest \n25 \n                                                 \n1 Official website of the Department of Homeland Security, \n26  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/media-resources/stats, U.S. Border Patrol Monthly \nApprehensions (FY 2000 – FY 2016) (last visited August 25, 2017). \n27  2 https://www.dhs.gov/southwest-border-security (last visited September 18, \n2017). \n28 \n  24   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.25   Page 25 of 53\n \n1  border during FY 2016, less than 8% occurred in the San Diego Sector and less \n2  than 5% occurred in the El Centro sector.3 \n3  83.  According to the DHS’s website, the San Diego Sector encompasses \n4  56,831 square miles including 931 miles of coastal border from the California \n5  border with Mexico north to Oregon.  The San Diego Sector’s primary operational \n6  area of responsibility consists of 7,000 square miles, including 60 linear miles of \n7  international boundary with Mexico and 114 coastal border miles along the Pacific \n8  Ocean.  USBP admits that there have been significant declines in the number of \n9  undocumented entries in the San Diego Sector over the last three decades.4 \n10  84.  On April 20, 2017, former Secretary Kelly stated that CBP has observed \n11  sharp reductions in the number of unauthorized entries across the southwestern \n12  border over the last several months, before the construction of any new border \n13  barriers or the replacement of any existing barriers. \n14  85.  The San Diego Waiver describes a “Project Area” that includes an area \n15  where multiple layers of primary, secondary and tertiary fencing already exist.  \n16  During a televised interview on April 20, 2017, former Secretary Kelly admitted \n17  that in locations along the border where fencing already exists, that fencing is \n18  “very, very effective” and “remarkably effective in keeping down the amount of \n19  illegal movement across” the border.   \n20  86.  In an infrastructure planning document prepared by CBP relating to the \n21  Border Wall Project, dated March 27, 2017, CBP rated its nine sectors along the \n22  southwest border according to infrastructure needs within each sector.  CBP \n23  admitted that there are no “high priority” areas for the construction of border \n24  barriers in California, Arizona, or west Texas.  \n                                                 \n25  3 Official website of the Department of Homeland Security, \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/san-\n26  diego-sector-california (last visited August 25, 2017). \n4 Official website of the Department of Homeland Security, \n27  https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/san-\ndiego-sector-california (last visited August 25, 2017). \n28 \n  25   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.26   Page 26 of 53\n \n1  87.  The proposed San Diego Project, Calexico Project, and the larger Border \n2  Wall Project include the replacement of existing primary and secondary fencing in \n3  areas that are neither “areas of high illegal entry,” nor areas where additional \n4  barriers will be most practical or effective.   \n5  88.  There have been no amendments to Section 102 of IIRIRA since the \n6  2008 Amendment was signed into law authorizing any legal waivers for additional \n7  construction projects outside those projects specifically authorized and \n8  contemplated when it was enacted.  Congressional authority under Section 102 \n9  provided for a December 31, 2008 completion date for those specified projects \n10  involving construction and reinforcement of fencing.  The proposed Border Wall \n11  Project, the San Diego Project and the Calexico Project include the replacement of \n12  existing primary and secondary fencing in areas that were not identified as \n13  “priority” areas before the 2008 completion date set forth in Section 102 of IIRIRA. \n14  V.  DEFENDANTS’ BORDER WALL PROJECT THREATENS THE STATE OF \nCALIFORNIA’S ECONOMIC, PROCEDURAL AND SOVEREIGN INTERESTS, \n15  AND WILL HARM THE STATE’S NATURAL RESOURCES \n16  89.  California owns real property and is financially responsible for the \n17  management of environmentally sensitive lands that are adjacent to the US-Mexico \n18  border, including areas where DHS seeks to replace primary and secondary fencing \n19  as part of the Border Wall project.  These properties include the 777-acre park \n20  known as Border Field State Park, and the Tijuana River National Estuarine \n21  Research Reserve which are located in the most southwestern portion of the \n22  continental United States and home to more than two dozen endangered and/or \n23  specially listed plant and animal species.  These properties are located within \n24  California’s coastal zone. \n25  90.  California incurs ongoing costs relating to the management and \n26  maintenance of Border Field State Park and the Tijuana Reserve.  These include \n27  expenses relating to the management of sensitive wetland and upland habitats \n28  within the reserve, the upkeep of roads, trails and recreational areas, and the \n  26   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.27   Page 27 of 53\n \n1  removal of invasive species.  California is also financially responsible for removal \n2  and disposal of sediment from the “Goat Canyon Sediment Basins,” sediment \n3  basins that were constructed in Border Field State Park to reduce the impacts of \n4  sedimentation from tributaries to the Tijuana River and upland areas along the \n5  border. \n6  91.  California will suffer direct injuries to its proprietary interests caused by \n7  the proposed Border Wall’s negative impacts on biological resources within \n8  California’s areas of responsibility, increases in invasive species, and/or increased \n9  sedimentation. \n10  92.  Further, the Executive Order and the threat of the Border Wall has had \n11  and will have a “chilling effect” on California tourism from Mexico.  California \n12  prides itself on its open and welcoming nature to citizens and non-citizens alike.  It \n13  is this nature that helps drive the State’s strong tourism economy, especially from \n14  Mexico, our neighbor to the South.  Tourism from Mexico and other countries is a \n15  “lead economic driver” of the State.  Mexicans made 7.9 million trips to California \n16  in 2016 and in total visitors from Mexico spent more than 3 billion dollars in \n17  California in 2015.5  An estimate from the global research firm Tourism Economics \n18  estimates Mexican tourism will drop by 7% in 2017, with a continuing downward \n19  trend in 2018.6 \n20  93.  California also has concrete and particularized interests in protecting its \n21  natural, recreational, agricultural, historical and cultural resources for the use, \n22  enjoyment and benefit of California’s residents.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n5 Visitcalifornia.com,  \n25  http://industry.visitcalifornia.com/media/uploads/files/editor/California%20Internat\nional%20Visitor%20Volume%20and%20Spend_2015Final_12-6-16.pdf  (last \n26  visited September 10, 2017);  http://industry.visitcalifornia.com/Find-\nResearch/California-Statistics-Trends/  (last visited September 10, 2017).   \n27  6 Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-\nmexico-us-travel-20170414-story.html \n28 \n  27   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.28   Page 28 of 53\n \n1  497, 518 (2007); Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, 646 F.3d 1161, 1178 (9th Cir. \n2  2011).   \n3  94.  The U.S.-Mexico border includes a 140-mile segment that also forms the \n4  southern border of California.  Within California, the border extends west from the \n5  Colorado River at the State’s southeastern corner, across the low-lying \n6  Colorado/Sonoran Desert and farmland in the Imperial Valley, over the rugged \n7  Otay Mountains, and all the way to the sands of Imperial Beach and the Pacific \n8  Ocean.  These regions are home to several endangered and/or specially listed plant \n9  and animal species. \n10  95.   Pursuant to the public trust doctrine and other state laws, California has a \n11  duty to protect and preserve these natural and biological resources within its \n12  boundaries. \n13  96.  Construction of the Border Wall will negatively impact sensitive \n14  biological habitats near the border as well as endangered and/or specially listed \n15  plant and animal species.   \n16  97.  Construction of the Border Wall will involve the use of heavy machinery, \n17  trucks and other equipment that will emit greenhouse gases.  These emissions will \n18  not be quantified or analyzed with respect to their impact on climate change.  \n19  Additionally, potential alternative border security projects will not be considered \n20  and mitigation measures will not be addressed pursuant to the normal NEPA review \n21  process.  The Border Wall construction will also involve the discharge of pollutants \n22  through storm water runoff and the discharge of waste water from the project to \n23  state lands and state waters.  The Border Wall construction and the Border Wall \n24  itself will therefore have significant negative impacts on California lands, air and \n25  water. \n26  98.  California will suffer direct injuries to its proprietary interests caused by \n27  the proposed Border Wall’s negative impacts on biological resources within \n28  California’s areas of responsibility, increases in invasive species, and/or increased \n  28   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.29   Page 29 of 53\n \n1  sedimentation resulting from and/or caused by construction of the Border Wall. \n2  99.  The areas along California’s southern border contain recreational, \n3  historical, and cultural resources enjoyed by California’s residents and visitors to \n4  California.  These resources include, but are not limited to beaches, hiking and \n5  mountain-bike trails, off-road vehicle recreational areas, historical monuments \n6  marking the Treaty of Guadalupe and cultural gathering places such as Friendship \n7  Park. These resources attract visitors to California and help to stimulate California’s \n8  economy.   \n9  100. The proposed Border Wall project will negatively impact the ability of \n10  California residents and visitors to obtain access to and enjoy these recreational, \n11  historical and cultural resources.   \n12  101. DHS has injured and continues to injure California by failing to disclose \n13  and consider the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects that the \n14  Border Wall project will have on the resources of California. \n15  102. In addition, California suffered and continues to suffer an injury to its \n16  procedural rights under the deliberation-forcing requirements of NEPA, which \n17  mandates that DHS evaluate various alternatives, the direct and indirect impacts \n18  that each alternative will have on the surrounding environment, and the means by \n19  which those impacts may be mitigated.  California also suffered and continues to \n20  suffer an injury to its procedural rights under the consistency requirements of the \n21  CZMA.  California’s procedural rights in this regard are related to the protection of \n22  the concrete and particularized interests within its territory, as alleged above.  \n23  Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, 646 F.3d 1161, 1178-1179 (9th Cir. 2011). \n24  103. Defendants’ reliance on Section 102 of IIRIRA as authority for \n25  construction of a Border Wall and issuance of a purported waiver of state laws \n26  infringes upon California’s sovereign right “to create and enforce a legal code, both  \n27  civil and criminal.” Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982); \n28  Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253 (4th Cir. 2011). \n  29   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.30   Page 30 of 53\n \n1  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Against Each Defendant Based on \nDefendants’ Failure to Comply with NEPA and the APA) \n3 \n4  104.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n5  above. \n6  105. NEPA compels federal agencies to evaluate and consider the direct, \n7  indirect and cumulative effects that a proposed development project or program will \n8  have on the environment by requiring the agency to prepare an environmental \n9  impact statement (EIS) that analyzes a reasonable range of alternatives and \n10  compares each alternative’s environmental impacts.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.16, 1508.7, \n11  1508.8, l508.27(b)(7).  The EIS must also include an analysis of the affected areas \n12  and resources and the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the \n13  alternatives.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.10 - 1502.19.  \n14  106. The preparation of an EIS not only forces the federal agency to consider \n15  these impacts on the environment but it also guarantees that the relevant \n16  information will be made public so that interested parties may play a role in both \n17  the decision making process and the implantation of that decision.  Robertson v. \n18  Methow Valley Citizen Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332 \n19  (2)(C). \n20  107. The agency must commence preparation of the EIS “as close as possible \n21  to the time that the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal” so that the \n22  environmental effects of each alternative can be evaluated in a meaningful way.  40 \n23  C.F.R. § 1502.23.   \n24  108. Defendants are in violation of NEPA because they failed to prepare an \n25  EIS concerning a construction project that will span hundreds of miles in four states \n26  and in areas that either contain or are adjacent to environmentally sensitive natural \n27  resources. \n28  109. California has concrete and particularized interests in the protection of its \n  30   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.31   Page 31 of 53\n \n1  own proprietary interests near the border as well as the protection of natural, \n2  historical, cultural, economic and recreational resources within its jurisdictional \n3  boundaries.  Defendants’ failure to comply with NEPA injures and denies \n4  California’s procedural rights necessary to protect these interests.  \n5  110. The People seek a judicial declaration that Defendants violated NEPA \n6  and further seeks an order enjoining DHS, requiring it to comply with NEPA before \n7  taking any further action related to the construction of the Border Wall project, \n8  including but not limited to the replacement of existing fences, the building of any \n9  prototypes, and the grading and widening of dirt roads.   \n10  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n11  (For Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief as to Each Defendant Based on \nDefendants’ Failure to Comply with the CZMA and the APA) \n12 \n13  111. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n14  above. \n15  112. The western portions of the San Diego Project fall within the coastal zone \n16  and, pursuant to the CZMA, California Coastal Act and the CCMP, are subject to \n17  the jurisdiction of the Commission.   \n18  113. The San Diego Project will affect, directly and indirectly, land and water \n19  uses within the coastal zone.  The San Diego Project will also affect, directly and \n20  indirectly, natural resources within the coastal zone.   \n21  114.  Under the CZMA, California Coastal Act and the CCMP, DHS is \n22  required to provide the Commission with a consistency determination \n23  demonstrating that their proposed Border Wall/fence replacement project will be \n24  undertaken in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with \n25  the CCMP.  \n26  115. The failure of DHS to submit a timely consistency determination violates \n27  the CZMA, the California Coastal Act and the CCMP. \n28  116. DHS’ conduct caused and will continue to cause an injury to Plaintiffs’ \n  31   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.32   Page 32 of 53\n \n1  procedural rights under the CZMA. \n2  117. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that DHS violated the CZMA and for \n3  an order enjoining DHS from taking any further action relating to the construction \n4  of the Border Wall/fence replacement project until it complies the requirements of \n5  the CZMA.     \n6  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7  (For Declaratory Relief Against Each Defendant on the Grounds that the San \nDiego Project, Calexico Project and Larger Border Wall Project Are Not \n8  Authorized by Section 102 of IIRIRA (Ultra Vires Violations)) \n9  118. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n10  above. \n11  119. The Executive Order and the San Diego and Calexico Waivers cite \n12  Section 102 of IIRIRA as authority for construction of the Border Wall and the San \n13  Diego and Calexico Projects.  8 U.S.C. § 1103 note. \n14  120. Section 102 of IIRIRA requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n15  take actions to install specified miles of “additional barriers and roads” or \n16  “additional fencing” along United States’ southwest border.  The 2008 Amendment \n17  to Section 102 of IIRIRA reflects both Congress’ recognition that fences already \n18  existed along portions of the border and its intent to better secure the border by \n19  installing additional fencing in areas where none existed at the time.  8 U.S.C. \n20  § 1103 note, subdiv. (a).     \n21  121. However, Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize or direct the \n22  Secretary of Homeland Security, or any other person or entity, to replace already \n23  existing fencing.     \n24  122. In addition, Section 102 of IIRIRA authorizes the Secretary of DHS to \n25  take actions as may be necessary “to install additional physical barriers and roads” \n26  in “areas of high illegal entry into the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, subdiv. \n27  (a).   \n28  123. The proposed San Diego Project and the proposed Calexico Project are \n  32   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.33   Page 33 of 53\n \n1  not in areas of high illegal entry and, therefore, are not authorized by Section 102 of \n2  IIRIRA.  In fact, multiple layers of fencing already exist in the San Diego Project \n3  area and DHS has given no facts to suggest that rebuilding an existing fence will \n4  further secure the border, especially as compared to areas without any fencing.  \n5  DHS has admitted the existing fences are effective in reducing unlawful entries into \n6  the United States, and specifically within the San Diego Project area. \n7  124. Additionally, the proposed San Diego Project and proposed Calexico \n8  Project are not located in areas where the fencing would be most practical and \n9  effective.  DHS has made no findings that rebuilding an existing fence in the San \n10  Diego area will reduce the number of illegal entries in the area.  Further, DHS \n11  admits that the most practical and effective areas to build fencing to further secure \n12  the border, would be in areas where no fence exists and where the fence would have \n13  a deterrent effect.  The DHS has made no such findings here and, therefore, the \n14  replacement of existing fencing and construction of prototypes are not authorized \n15  by Section 102 of IIRIRA. \n16  125. Further, the larger proposed Border Wall Project, as reflected in the \n17  Executive Order, is not authorized by Section 102 of IIRIRA because it fails to \n18  distinguish between different areas of the border and whether a particular area is an \n19  area of high illegal entry into the United States.   \n20  126. Section 102 also does not authorize the construction of prototype barriers \n21  that are to be used for the purpose of planning and not for the purpose of preventing \n22  illegal entries. The prototypes fall outside the “additional physical barriers” \n23  contemplated by Section 102 of IIRIRA. \n24  127. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Defendants’ Border Wall \n25  Project, which includes but is not limited to the construction of prototypes in San \n26  Diego County, the construction of the San Diego Project and the Calexico Project, \n27  the replacement of existing fences with alternative fencing, barriers, and/or walls, \n28  the installation of barriers in areas that are not areas of high illegal entry, as well as \n  33   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.34   Page 34 of 53\n \n1  the construction of over 1,000 miles of new barriers along the southern border that \n2  were not identified or constructed prior to the deadline specified in the statute, are \n3  not authorized under Section 102 of IIRIRA. \n4  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  (For Declaratory Relief Against Each Defendant on the Grounds that the \nSecretary’s Waiver Authority Expired on December 31, 2008 (Ultra Vires \n6  Violations Relating to The Waiver Provision)) \n7    128. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n8  above. \n9  129. Section 102 required the DHS Secretary to construct reinforced fencing \n10  along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most \n11  practical and effective.     \n12  130. Section 102 also required the DHS Secretary to identify the 370 miles or \n13  other mileage as determined by the Secretary of “priority areas . . .where fencing \n14  would be most practical and effective in deterring smugglers and aliens attempting \n15  to gain illegal entry into the United States,” and to complete the construction of \n16  fencing in those priority areas, by not later than December 31, 2008.  8 U.S.C. § \n17  1103 note, subdiv. (b)(1)(B). \n18  131. DHS identified “priority areas” pursuant to Section 102 before the \n19  December 31, 2008 deadline and completed its construction of barriers in those \n20  areas shortly after the deadline.  Currently, there are 702 miles of border primary, \n21  secondary, and tertiary fencing along the border.  Thus, DHS satisfied the mileage \n22  requirements set by Congress and it did so within, or shortly after, the time frame \n23  set by Congress.   \n24  132. DHS did not include the project areas described in the San Diego or \n25  Calexico Waivers as part of its obligation to identify and construct necessary \n26  barriers in Priority Areas prior to the December 31, 2008, deadline. \n27  133. The authority of the Secretary to identify “priority areas” for construction \n28  and to expedite the construction of barriers or roads in these areas under Section \n  34   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.35   Page 35 of 53\n \n1  102 expired on December 31, 2008.   \n2  134. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Defendants’ authority to \n3  expedite the construction of barriers and roads through the use of Section 102’s \n4  waiver provision expired on December 31, 2008, and, that the San Diego Waiver \n5  and the Calexico Waiver are ineffective and invalid.   \n6  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7  (For Declaratory Relief Against Each Defendant on the Grounds that the San \nDiego and Calexico Waivers Are Invalid Because Each Waiver Fails to Satisfy the \n8  Requirements of Section 102 of IIRIRA) \n9  135. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n10  above. \n11  136. In order to exercise the waiver authority expressed at subsection (c) of \n12  Section 102 of IIRIRA, the Secretary of DHS must satisfy the prerequisites for \n13  expedited construction as set forth in the other provisions of Section 102.   \n14  137. Here, the San Diego Waiver is invalid because former Secretary Kelly \n15  failed to present findings and cannot support findings sufficient to establish that the \n16  fence replacement and the prototype construction projects described in the waiver \n17  constitute “additional” barriers for the purpose of deterring illegal crossings, as \n18  required by subdivision (a) of Section 102 of IIRIRA.  Similarly, the Calexico \n19  Waiver is invalid because Acting Secretary Duke failed to present findings and \n20  cannot support findings sufficient to establish that the fence replacement project \n21  described in the waiver constitutes “additional” barriers for the purpose of deterring \n22  illegal crossings, as required by subdivision (a) of Section 102 of IIRIRA. \n23  138. The San Diego and Calexico Waivers are also invalid because former \n24  Secretary Kelly and Acting Secretary Duke failed to present findings and cannot \n25  support findings sufficient to establish that the San Diego Project and Calexico \n26  Project are being constructed in areas of “high illegal entry,” as required by \n27  subdivision (a) of Section 102 of IIRIRA.  While the San Diego Waiver states that \n28  the San Diego sector is one of the busiest in the nation and refers to the number of \n  35   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.36   Page 36 of 53\n \n1  apprehensions and drug arrests in the sector as a whole, reports published by DHS, \n2  USBP and statements made by former Secretary Kelly, establish that the 15-mile \n3  sector described in the San Diego Waiver is not an area of high illegal entry.  \n4  Similarly, reports published by DHS and the USBP indicate that the number of \n5  apprehensions in the El Centro Sector is low when compared to other border patrol \n6  sectors. \n7  139. The San Diego and Calexico Waivers are also invalid because former \n8  Secretary Kelly and Acting Secretary Duke, respectively, failed to present findings \n9  and cannot support findings sufficient to establish that the project areas are located \n10  in areas where the additional barriers will be the “most practical and effective,” as \n11  required by subdivision (b) of Section 102 of IIRIRA.  \n12  140. Further, the San Diego Waiver is invalid because former Secretary Kelly \n13  failed to describe the “various border infrastructure projects” that DHS intends to \n14  install in the Project Area.  In other words, DHS seeks to waive federal, state and \n15  local laws for projects that it fails to describe and that it may seek to construct at \n16  some time in the future, without any time limitation.  As a result, Defendants are \n17  denying Plaintiffs and other parties with a reasonable opportunity to assess whether \n18  said undisclosed projects, that may be included within the San Diego Project area, \n19  comply with the prerequisites of the statute and whether the projects will impact \n20  their interests within the time frame established by subdivision (c) of Section 102 of \n21  IIRIRA. \n22  141. The San Diego and Calexico Waivers are also invalid because \n23  Defendants seek to waive federal, state, and local laws for the continued and \n24  indefinite “upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, \n25  erosion controls and safety features. . .”  The San Diego and Calexico Waivers lack \n26  any definition or time limitations with respect to any of these terms.  As a result, \n27  Defendants cannot satisfy their burden of establishing the waivers are needed for \n28  the expedited construction of barriers or roads, or that, at the time the upkeep \n  36   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.37   Page 37 of 53\n \n1  eventually occurs, the infrastructure is located in an area of high illegal entry. \n2  142. The San Diego and Calexico Waivers are also invalid because the project \n3  areas described in each waiver were not identified as “priority areas,” and the \n4  projects were not constructed before December 31, 2008, the deadline to designate \n5  and construct fencing in priority areas.   \n6  143. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that the waiver of laws articulated in \n7  the San Diego Waiver and the Calexico Waiver is ineffective and invalid.   \n8  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9  (The San Diego Waiver Violates Article III of the United States Constitution and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment) \n10 \n11  144. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n12  above. \n13  145. Article III of the United States Constitution safeguards both the powers \n14  of the judicial branch and litigants’ rights to have their claims decided by a \n15  judiciary that is independent of pressures from the legislative and executive \n16  branches.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848 \n17  (1986).  Article III also ensures the federal judiciary is empowered to resolve \n18  claims brought by the states and controversies in which the United States is a party.  \n19  (Article III, Sec. 2.) \n20  146. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and principles of \n21  fundamental fairness further guarantee that judicial proceedings will be conducted \n22  in a manner that ensures parties reasonable notice of matters impacting their \n23  interests and a meaningful opportunity to present grievances or defenses under the \n24  procedures prescribed by law.  Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 444-445 (2011); see \n25  also, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976). \n26  147. Subdivision (c) of Section 102 of IIRIRA provides that the district courts \n27  of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims \n28  arising from any action or decision made by the Secretary of DHS pursuant to the \n  37   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.38   Page 38 of 53\n \n1  waiver provision.  Subdivision (c) further provides that any such cause or claim \n2  shall be filed within 60 days of the Secretary’s decision under the waiver provision.  \n3  Under this process, the Secretary’s publication of the waiver in the Federal Register \n4  is intended to place potential litigants on notice of the need to sue. \n5  148. The Attorney General is the chief law officer of the State of California, \n6  who by the California Constitution has the authority to file civil actions in order to \n7  protect the People’s rights and interests, the environment, and the natural resources \n8  of this state.  Cal. Const., art V, § 13, Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12600-12612, 12511-\n9  12512.  The People have jurisdictional, procedural, economic, and sovereign \n10  interests that are being impacted, and will continue to be impacted, by the San \n11  Diego Waiver and San Diego Project. \n12  149. The Commission is a state agency designated as the agency responsible \n13  for implementing the CZMA within California’s coastal zone and developing state \n14  programs designed to meet the goals of the CZMA.  American Petroleum Institute v. \n15  Knecht, 609 F.2d 1306 (9th Cir. 1979); Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 30008, 30330.  The \n16  San Diego Project is planned to take place, in part, within the coastal zone.  Thus, \n17  the Commission has jurisdictional and procedural interests that are being impacted, \n18  and will continue to be impacted, by the San Diego Waiver and the San Diego \n19  Project. \n20  150. Plaintiffs have a right to sue under subdivision (c) of Section 102 of \n21  IIRIRA and are entitled a judicial process that is fundamentally fair, which includes \n22  reasonable notice of the projects for which federal and state laws are being waived \n23  and a meaningful opportunity concerning whether those projects are authorized by \n24  Section 102 of IIRIRA.  \n25  151. The San Diego Waiver states that DHS intends to install “various border \n26  infrastructure projects” within the “Project Area,” a 15-mile segment of the border.  \n27  While the San Diego Waiver identifies two examples of infrastructure projects, \n28  specifically the replacement of primary fencing and the construction of temporary \n  38   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.39   Page 39 of 53\n \n1  barrier prototypes, DHS’ waiver is not limited to those examples.  DHS seeks to \n2  waive the application of more than 30 federal laws, as well as county and state laws, \n3  in order to expedite the construction of “various border infrastructure projects” \n4  without providing any description of all the projects DHS intends to construct.  The \n5  waiver fails to provide reasonable notice of the projects that DHS intends to \n6  construct. \n7  152. The San Diego Waiver also fails to provide reasonable notice of when \n8  any of these undisclosed projects will be constructed.  While the San Diego Waiver \n9  includes the statement that the various projects will be “immediately implemented,” \n10  DHS and Trump Administration officials have admitted that DHS does not have \n11  sufficient funding in its current budget to construct all of the projects that it wants \n12  to build, including the replacement of secondary fencing.  The funding of this \n13  secondary fencing and other undisclosed projects is dependent on the availability of \n14  funding in future budgets.  Thus, DHS is attempting to apply Section 102’s \n15  expedited construction provision to projects that it cannot construct in an \n16  expeditious manner, if ever.   \n17  153. The San Diego Waiver also fails to provide reasonable notice of where \n18  the undisclosed infrastructure projects will be built.  For example, although the San \n19  Diego Waiver describes a 15-mile segment of the border as the “Project Area,” the \n20  San Diego Waiver fails to state how far the project area will extend in a northerly \n21  direction or where the undisclosed projects will be placed in relation to real \n22  property owned by the State of California.  The San Diego Waiver also leaves open \n23  the possibility that DHS may, in the future, condemn property for the purpose of \n24  constructing projects that are currently undisclosed.   \n25  154. The San Diego Waiver also attempts to waive laws for the continued \n26  “upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, erosion controls \n27  and safety features . . .”  The San Diego Waiver lacks any definition or time \n28  limitations with respect to any of these terms.  By applying the waiver provision to \n  39   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.40   Page 40 of 53\n \n1  the continued and indefinite “upkeep” of undefined “supporting elements” and \n2  “safety features,” the Secretary is attempting to extend his waiver authority to \n3  matters beyond the expedited construction of border barriers and roads. \n4  155. The vague and indefinite nature of the San Diego Waiver renders \n5  Plaintiffs’ purported right to sue under subdivision (c) of Section 102 of IIRIRA an \n6  illusory right that fails to satisfy the basic requirements of fundamental fairness. As \n7  a direct result of the failure to describe the “various border infrastructure projects” \n8  that will be covered by the waiver or where and when, with specificity, they will be \n9  constructed, Defendants are denying Plaintiffs and others a reasonable notice and a \n10  meaningful opportunity to formulate and prepare a claim with respect to \n11  undisclosed projects within the 60-day limitations period set forth in subdivision (c) \n12  of Section 102 of IIRIRA with respect to each undisclosed project.   \n13  156. Defendants’ conduct violates Plaintiffs’ due process rights and Plaintiffs’ \n14  rights under Article III of the United States Constitution.   \n15  157. Further, as a direct result of the failure to describe the “various border \n16  infrastructure projects” that will be covered by the waiver or where and when, with \n17  specificity, they will be constructed, Defendants are also interfering with the United \n18  States District Court’s ability to exercise its authority under Article III of the \n19  Constitution of the United States.  The San Diego Waiver is so vague, ambiguous \n20  and overly broad with respect to the undisclosed projects that DHS intends to build \n21  and the continued upkeep of undefined project features, that it has the effect of \n22  denying the District Court an opportunity to assess whether each individual project \n23  satisfies the prerequisites for construction under Section 102 of IIRIRA, and \n24  comports with the United States Constitution. \n25  158. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that the San Diego Waiver violates \n26  Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the fundamental fairness doctrine at the heart of \n27  the judicial process, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n28 \n  40   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.41   Page 41 of 53\n \n1  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine) \n3  159. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n4  above. \n5  160. The Framers of the Constitution have determined that “within our \n6  political scheme, the separation of governmental powers into three coordinate \n7  Branches is essential to the preservation of liberty.”  Mistretta v. U.S., 488 U.S. \n8  361, 380-384, 109 S.Ct. 64 (1989). \n9  161. As part of this fundamental doctrine, the Supreme Court “has invalidated \n10  attempts by Congress to exercise the responsibilities of other Branches or to \n11  reassign powers vested by the Constitution in either the Judicial Branch or the \n12  Executive Branch.”  Id.  For example, in Clinton v. New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), \n13  the Supreme Court overturned an act of Congress, ruling that Congress may not \n14  vest its own legislative powers in the Executive Branch, even if Congress intended \n15  such a result. \n16  162. Section 102(c) vests unilateral power in the Secretary of the Department \n17  of Homeland Security to waive the application of any law in areas along the \n18  southwest border if he or she deems it necessary to expeditiously build a border \n19  barrier.  For example, Section 102 empowers the Secretary with discretion to \n20  nullify the application of laws that are intended to protect the environment, prevent \n21  unlawful discrimination, promote workplace safety and prevent corruption in the \n22  award of government contracts.  Under Section 102, the Secretary is authorized to \n23  decide which laws to obey or disregard in planning and construction of \n24  infrastructure projects along the southwest border without any advanced \n25  designation of those particular laws by Congress. \n26  163. Through this Act, Congress has vested its own legislative powers in the \n27  Executive Branch in violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine of the U.S. \n28  Constitution. \n  41   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.42   Page 42 of 53\n \n1  164. The statute as written is facially invalid.  This claim is asserted against \n2  Defendant United States of America without regard to any action undertaken or \n3  decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security to invoke the \n4  unconstitutional waiver provision. \n5  165. In addition, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the separation of \n6  powers doctrine as applied in this case, because Congress has vested its own \n7  legislative powers in the Executive Branch in violation of the Separation of Powers \n8  doctrine of the U.S. Constitution to allow the waiver of more than 30 federal laws \n9  by the Executive Branch.  Congress must designate in advance each law it is \n10  waiving through its legislation, and can then, and only then, provide the Executive \n11  Branch discretion to waive those laws as it sees fit, thus implementing a legislative \n12  action.   \n13  166. Further, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the separation of \n14  powers doctrine as applied in this case because Defendants are relying on the \n15  waiver provision to divest Congress of its legislative powers 10 years after \n16  Congress imposed a deadline to identify and expedite the construction of border \n17  barriers in priority areas.  The waiver provision is being applied in a manner that \n18  divests Congress of its legislative powers, with respect to application of laws in the \n19  border region, in perpetuity.   \n20  167. Finally, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the separation of \n21  powers doctrine as applied in this case because they provide for the vague and \n22  indefinite, and potentially never-ending, divestment of legislative powers in \n23  violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine.  For example, the San Diego \n24  Waiver does not disclose all of the “various border infrastructure projects” to which \n25  the waiver is being applied nor does it disclose when those undisclosed projects \n26  will be constructed.  The San Diego and Calexico Waivers also attempt to waive \n27  laws for the continued “upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, \n28  drainage, erosion controls and safety features. . .” but lack any definition or time \n  42   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.43   Page 43 of 53\n \n1  limitations with respect to these terms.  By failing to describe the various projects \n2  that DHS may build within a 15-mile project area, and by applying the waiver \n3  provision to the continued and indefinite “upkeep” of undefined “supporting \n4  elements” and “safety features,” Defendants are attempting to extend the waiver \n5  authority to matters beyond the expedited construction of border barriers and roads.  \n6  Defendants are applying Section 102’s waiver provision in a manner that divests \n7  Congress of its legislative powers along a 15-mile and 3-mile segments of the \n8  border indefinitely.   \n9  168. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Section 102 of IIRIRA violates \n10  the Separation of Powers doctrine of the U.S. Constitution because it improperly \n11  vests legislative power in the Executive Branch.   \n12  EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n13  (Violation of Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution) \n14  169. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n15  above. \n16  170. Article 1, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that “[a]ll \n17  legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United  \n18  States . . .” \n19  171. This clause of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that all \n20  lawmaking functions have been vested in the Congress and cannot be delegated to \n21  another branch.  Loving v. U.S., 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996). \n22  172. Section 102(c) delegates to the Executive Branch, namely the Secretary \n23  of the Department of Homeland Security, the power to waive the application of any \n24  act of Congress along the entire southwest border.  The only guidance Congress \n25  provided to the Executive Branch was to say that the waiver should be exercised as \n26  the Secretary “determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the \n27  barriers and roads under this section.”  Section 102(c) provides no other guidance \n28  concerning which particular laws should be waived and which laws should be \n  43   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.44   Page 44 of 53\n \n1  followed. Though the words “necessary” and “expeditious” may have held meaning \n2  when enacted in 2008, they no longer do in light of the time elapsed since their \n3  passage.  Additionally, the 2008 Amendment imposed a deadline on DHS to \n4  identify “priority areas” and expedite the construction of additional barriers in those \n5  areas by not later than December 31, 2008. In light of these provisions and the \n6  passage of time, the purpose of the waiver provision cannot be said to continue to \n7  reflect Congressional intent nine years later.   \n8  173.  Thus, Section 102(c) permits the Secretary to make legislative decisions \n9  without an intelligible principle to guide it.  This Act therefore violates Article I, \n10  Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and the non-delegation doctrine. \n11  174.  Additionally, Congress retained no checks on the actions of the \n12  Executive Branch pursuant to Section 102(c), and removed any opportunity for \n13  judicial review outside of Constitutional issues.  This lack of meaningful \n14  reviewability renders the delegation improper.  Amalgamated Meat Cutters and \n15  Butcher Workmen of North Am. v. Connally, 337 F. Supp. 737, 759 (D.D.C. 1971). \n16  175. The statute as written is therefore facially invalid.  This claim is asserted \n17  against Defendant United States of America without regard to any action \n18  undertaken or decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security to invoke the \n19  unconstitutional waiver provision. \n20  176. Section 102(c) is also invalid as applied in this case, because, for the \n21  reasons stated above, Congress cannot properly delegate to the Executive Branch \n22  the ability to waive any and all federal laws with no meaningful opportunity for \n23  review of that waiver.  Thus, the former Secretary’s waiver of more than 30 federal \n24  laws and the acting Secretary’s wavier of 27 federal laws violate Article I, Section 1 \n25  of the U.S. Constitution.    \n26  177. Further, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the non-delegation \n27  doctrine because Defendants are relying on the waiver provision to divest Congress \n28  of its legislative powers 10 years after Congress imposed a deadline to identify and \n  44   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.45   Page 45 of 53\n \n1  expedite the construction of border barriers in priority areas.  The waiver provision \n2  is being applied in a manner that divests Congress of its legislative powers, with \n3  respect to application of laws in the border region, in perpetuity.  Congress did not \n4  delegate its functions with respect to application and/or waiver of laws to the \n5  Secretary of Homeland Security in perpetuity. \n6  178. Finally, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the non-delegation \n7  doctrine as applied in this case because the waiver provision is being applied in a \n8  manner that extends the purported delegation of legislative authority, within the \n9  described project areas, indefinitely.  For example, the San Diego Waiver does not \n10  disclose all of the “various border infrastructure projects” to which the Waiver is \n11  being applied nor does it disclose when those undisclosed projects will be \n12  constructed.  The San Diego and Calexico Waivers also attempt to waive laws for \n13  the continued “upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, \n14  erosion controls and safety features. . .”  The San Diego and Calexico Waivers lack \n15  any definition or time limitations with respect to any of these terms.  By failing to \n16  describe the various projects and applying the waiver provision to continued and \n17  indefinite “upkeep” of undefined “supporting elements” and “safety features,” \n18  Defendants are attempting to extend the waiver authority to matters beyond the \n19  expedited construction of border barriers and roads.  Congress did not delegate its \n20  functions with respect to the application and/or waiver of laws to the Secretary of \n21  Homeland Security without regard to the nature of the border infrastructure project \n22  or whether it would be constructed in an expedited fashion.  \n23  179. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Section 102 of IIRIRA violates \n24  Article 1, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and is an improper delegation of \n25  legislative power to the Executive Branch.  \n26   \n27   \n28 \n  45   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.46   Page 46 of 53\n \n1  NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Violation of Article I, Section 3 of the United States Constitution) \n3  180. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n4  above. \n5  181. Article I, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution provides that “[j]udgment in \n6  Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and \n7  disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the \n8  United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n9  Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” \n10  182. The Supreme Court has interpreted Article I, Section 3 to mean there is \n11  no immunity provided by the U.S. Constitution to criminal laws or criminal \n12  prosecution and that no person is above the law.  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, \n13  503-504, 94 S.Ct. 669 (1974); Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 31-32, 101 S.Ct. 183 \n14  (1980); U.S. v. Lee, (1882) 106 U.S. 196, 220, 1 S.Ct. 240 (1882). \n15  183. Absent a clear immunity or waiver from a criminal law enacted by \n16  Congress and signed by the President, the Executive Branch cannot violate or \n17  nullify a criminal law. \n18  184. Section 102(c) vests unilateral power in the Secretary of the Department \n19  of Homeland Security to waive the application of any laws that he or she \n20  determines is necessary to expeditiously build a border wall, including any criminal \n21  laws, such as bribery, racketeering and other anti-corruption laws without a clear, \n22  specific waiver of these statutes by an act of Congress that is signed by the \n23  President. \n24  185. This power to waive any criminal law to expeditiously build the Border \n25  Wall, in the absence of an act of Congress that authorizes the waiver of those \n26  criminal laws specifically, violates Article I, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. \n27  186. The statute as written is therefore facially invalid.  This claim is asserted \n28  against Defendant United States of America without regard to any action \n  46   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.47   Page 47 of 53\n \n1  undertaken or decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security to invoke the \n2  unconstitutional waiver provision. \n3  187. Further, the San Diego and Calexico Waivers waive criminal laws, \n4  including those under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 \n5  U.S.C. § 6921), the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1311) and the \n6  Endangered Species Act (15 U.S.C. § 1540).  The former Secretary and Acting \n7  Secretary have therefore waived criminal laws for the illegal disposal of hazardous \n8  waste on land or in our nation’s waters as well as criminal laws concerning the \n9  taking of endangered species.  The waivers do not even provide the public with \n10  information concerning which parts of the specified criminal laws may be \n11  disregarded and why.   \n12    188.  The statute is invalid as applied in this case because Congress did not \n13  explicitly authorize the waiver of criminal laws described in the San Diego or \n14  Calexico Waivers, nor did it immunize specific acts from criminal prosecution.  \n15    189. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Section 102 of IIRIRA violates \n16  Article I, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution because it improperly allows the \n17  Executive Branch to violate or nullify criminal laws, including criminal hazardous \n18  waste laws.   \n19  TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20  (Violation of Article I, Section 7 of the United States Constitution) \n21  190. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n22  above. \n23  191. Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Every Bill \n24  which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before \n25  it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approves \n26  he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.” \n27  192. The Supreme Court has stated that this means that the Executive Branch \n28  cannot void any law without Congress passing a law voiding the previous law and \n  47   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.48   Page 48 of 53\n \n1  presenting it to the President for signature.  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n2  417 (1998). \n3  193. Section 102(c) vests unilateral power in the Secretary of the Department \n4  of Homeland Security to waive the application of any laws in areas along the border \n5  for purposes of building the Border Wall without Congress passing a law to void \n6  the specific laws at issue or limit their application, and presenting it to the President \n7  in violation of Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution. \n8  194. The statute as written is therefore facially invalid. This claim is asserted \n9  against Defendant United States of America without regard to any action \n10  undertaken or decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security to invoke the \n11  unconstitutional waiver provision. \n12  195. The statute is also invalid as applied in this case.  Here, former Secretary \n13  Kelly unilaterally decided to waive more than 30 federal laws, and Acting Secretary \n14  Duke unilaterally decided to waive 27 federal laws.  In so doing, each unilaterally \n15  chose which laws to waive and which laws to obey, without an act of Congress \n16  specifying which particular law or set of laws could be waived and without the \n17  presentation of said Congressional act to the President. \n18  196. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Section 102 of IIRIRA violates \n19  Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution because it allows the Executive Branch \n20  to nullify the application of an act of Congress without Congress passing a law and \n21  presenting it to the President. \n22  ELEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n23  (Violation of the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution) \n24  197. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate each and every paragraph \n25  above. \n26  198. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, “[t]he \n27  powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n28  to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” \n  48   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.49   Page 49 of 53\n \n1  199. States, therefore, have “the power to create and enforce a legal code, both \n2  civil and criminal.”  Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592 (1982); \n3  Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253 (4th Cir. 2011).  Congress may \n4  not infringe on the State of California’s sovereign authority to enforce its own laws.  \n5  “[W]hen a federal law interferes with a state's exercise of its sovereign ‘power to \n6  create and enforce a legal code’ [ ] it inflict[s] on the state the requisite injury-in-\n7  fact.”  Cty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, No. 17-CV-00485-WHO, 2017 WL 1459081, \n8  at *17 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017), reconsideration denied, No. 17-CV-00485-WHO, \n9  2017 WL 3086064 (N.D. Cal. July 20, 2017), quoting Ohio ex rel. Celebrezze v. \n10  U.S. Dep't of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 233 (6th Cir. 1985). \n11  200. On its face, Section 102(c) vests the Secretary of the Department of \n12  Homeland Security with the power to waive “all legal requirements” in order to \n13  expeditiously build the border wall.  If this phrase is interpreted to allow the \n14  Secretary to waive the application of state and local laws, it would include the \n15  power to waive state laws that are intended to ensure work-place safety, anti-\n16  harassment and discrimination laws, state wage and hour laws, anti-corruption laws, \n17  laws relating to public safety, or any other state law, including criminal \n18  enforcement provisions of state law.  \n19  201. Although Congress may preempt state and local laws in a particular \n20  legislative field, Congress does not have the power to simply waive all state and \n21  local laws and vest in the Executive Branch the power to waive all such laws. \n22  202. Section 102(c), by creating such authority and vesting it in the Secretary \n23  of the Department of Homeland Security, violates the Tenth Amendment of the \n24  U.S. Constitution. \n25  203. The statute as written is therefore facially invalid and this claim is \n26  asserted against Defendant United States of America without regard to any action \n27  undertaken or decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security to invoke the \n28  unconstitutional waiver provision.  \n  49   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.50   Page 50 of 53\n \n1  204. The statute is also invalid as applied in this matter.  In their attempts to \n2  exercise Section 102’s waiver provision, former Secretary Kelly and Acting \n3  Secretary Duke issued waivers that purport to waive federal laws and numerous \n4  California laws that are related to the same subjects, including Porter-Cologne \n5  Water Quality Control Act (Cal. Water Code, §§ 13000, et seq.), California \n6  Endangered Species Act (Cal. Fish & Game Code, §§ 2050-2115.5), California \n7  State Historical Resources Act (Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 5020-5029), California \n8  Coastal Act (Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 30000-30900), California Fish and Game \n9  Laws (Cal. Fish & Game Code, §§ 1801 and 4181) and California’s public nuisance \n10  laws (Cal. Gov. Code, §§ 12600 et seq.; Cal. Civ. Code, § 3480; Cal. Pen. Code, § \n11  370.).  These state laws do not conflict with any federal law and Congress has not \n12  explicitly stated an intent to preempt state laws in these areas. \n13  205. Further, as construed by the Secretaries of DHS, the authority to waive \n14  California laws is indefinite in duration and unlimited, subject to the barest of \n15  findings that a border crossing is an area of high illegal entry, with no standards or \n16  criteria for making this determination.  The former Secretary and Acting Secretary \n17  have attempted to apply Section 102’s waiver provision over nine years after its last \n18  amendment in which Congress referenced projects limited to 2008.   \n19    206.  Additionally, the San Diego Waiver attempts to waive state laws with \n20  respect to the construction of “various border infrastructure projects” without \n21  defining what those projects will be or when they will be constructed.  As noted \n22  below, this appears to include projects for which funding is not currently available.   \n23  207.  The San Diego and Calexico Waivers also attempt to waive state laws \n24  for the continued “upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, \n25  drainage, erosion controls and safety features. . .”  The waivers lack any definition \n26  or time limitations with respect to any of these terms.  By failing to incorporate \n27  meaningful definitions, the scope of the intrusion by Defendants into areas of \n28  historic state regulation and governance is potentially vast, extending beyond just \n  50   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.51   Page 51 of 53\n \n1  the expedited construction of border barriers and roads.   \n2  208. DHS is applying Section 102 in a manner that would grant them an \n3  indefinite and open-ended waiver of state laws in violation of the 10th Amendment. \n4  209. Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that Section 102 of IIRIRA violates \n5  the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by vesting in the Executive Branch \n6  the power to waive state and local laws, including state criminal law.  \n7  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n8  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the Court to enter a judgment: \n9  1.  Declaring that DHS violated NEPA and the APA, and continues to \n10  violate NEPA and the APA, by failing to conduct NEPA review prior to engaging \n11  in planning and construction activities concerning the Border Wall and the San \n12  Diego and Calexico Projects. \n13  2.  Declaring that DHS violated the CZMA and the APA, and continues to \n14  violate the CZMA and the APA, by failing to provide the Commission with a \n15  consistency determination demonstrating that the San Diego Project will be \n16  undertaken in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with \n17  the CCMP. \n18  3.  Declaring that Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the replacement \n19  of existing fencing or barriers and that the San Diego and Calexico Waivers are \n20  therefore inapplicable and invalid with respect to the replacement of existing \n21  fencing or barriers.  \n22  4.   Declaring that Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the replacement \n23  of existing fencing or the construction of new barriers areas within the project areas \n24  described in the San Diego and Calexico Waivers because the project areas are not \n25  located in areas “of high illegal entry” and that the Waivers are inapplicable and \n26  invalid. \n27  5.  Declaring that Section 102 of IIRIRA does not authorize the construction \n28  of prototype fences, barriers or walls for the purpose of planning and that the San \n  51   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.52   Page 52 of 53\n \n1  Diego Waiver is inapplicable and invalid with respect to the prototype construction \n2  described in that waiver. \n3  6.  Declaring that the San Diego and Calexico Waivers are ineffective and \n4  invalid because the authority to waive laws under Section 102 of IIRIRA expired on \n5  December 31, 2008. \n6  7.  Declaring that the San Diego and Calexico Waivers are ineffective and \n7  invalid because the waivers failed to satisfy the requirements of Section 102 of \n8  IIRIRA and Defendants cannot meet their burden of making and supporting \n9  findings to meet Section 102’s requirements. \n10  8.  Declaring that, as applied in this matter with respect to the San Diego \n11  Waiver, subsection (c) of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates Article III of the \n12  United States Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n13  9.  Declaring that, on its face and as applied in this matter with respect to the \n14  Border Wall Project, the San Diego Project and the Calexico Project, subsection (c) \n15  of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates the Separation of Powers doctrine of the \n16  United States Constitution. \n17  10.  Declaring that, on its face and as applied in this matter with respect to the \n18  Border Wall Project, the San Diego Project, and the Calexico Project, subsection (c) \n19  of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates Article I, Section 1 of the United States \n20  Constitution. \n21  11.  Declaring that, on its face and as applied in this matter with respect to the \n22  Border Wall Project, the San Diego Project and the Calexico Project, subsection (c) \n23  of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates Article I, Section 3 of the United States \n24  Constitution. \n25  12.  Declaring that, on its face and as applied in this matter with respect to the \n26  Border Wall Project, the San Diego Project, and the Calexico Project, subsection (c) \n27  of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates Article I, Section 7 of the United States \n28  Constitution. \n  52   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01911-W-BLM   Document 1   Filed 09/20/17   PageID.53   Page 53 of 53\n \n1  13.  Declaring that, on its face and as applied in this matter with respect to the \n2  Border Wall Project, the San Diego Project and the Calexico Project, subsection (c) \n3  of Section 102 of the IIRIRA violates Tenth Amendment of the United States \n4  Constitution. \n5  14.  Granting injunctive relief to Plaintiffs and enjoining Defendants from \n6  undertaking any activities concerning construction of the Border Wall until DHS \n7  demonstrates compliance with NEPA and the APA.  \n8  15.  Granting injunctive relief to Plaintiffs and enjoining Defendants from \n9  undertaking any activities concerning construction of the Border Wall until DHS \n10  demonstrates compliance with the CZMA and the APA. \n11  16.  Granting injunctive relief to the Plaintiffs and enjoining the Secretary of \n12  DHS from waiving any laws for the purpose of expeditiously building the Trump \n13  Administration’s Border Wall, the San Diego Project, and the Calexico Project. \n14  17.
