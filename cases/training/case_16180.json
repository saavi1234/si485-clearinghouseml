    "summary": "<p>On June 15, 2017, the Center for Biological Diversity brought this lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  Plaintiff filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California and the case was assigned to Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel (whom Trump had previously <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/05/the-judge-trump-disparaged-as-mexican-will-preside-over-an-important-border-wall-case/?utm_term=.c2ce8da18ba2\">disparaged</a> in an unrelated case).  The case combined several different challenges to the Trump Administration's planned border wall, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. </p><p>After an initial complaint and a First Amended Complaint, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on Sept. 6.  According to the Second Amended Complaint, plaintiff is \"an environmental conservation organization that works to protect native wildlife species and their habitats.\"  In the wake of President Trump's Executive Order (EO) <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02095.pdf\">No. 13767</a>, authorizing expanded border wall construction, plaintiff feared that such construction would harm the environment, in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and other environmental statutes.   Plaintiff was also concerned that the border wall would harm plaintiff's members who frequented borderland wildlife areas.</p><p>The first issue was under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  On May 2, 2017, the plaintiff had submitted a FOIA request to DHS and CBP.  The requested records related to the agencies' statutorily mandated environmental analysis, as well as compliance with other environmental laws, for the border wall prototype project.  Plaintiff alleged that defendants, by failing to respond, had violated FOIA or alternatively the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). </p><p>The second issue was about compliance with NEPA's requirement of public participation in agency decisionmaking.  On June 1, plaintiff notified DHS that it believed the wall would violate the environmental statutes.  However, DHS provided no notice-and-comment or public participation procedure, nor did it respond to plaintiff's communications.  This too was argued to violate NEPA, its implementing regulations, and the APA.</p><p>The third issue was about both substantive and procedural application of the environmental laws.  On Aug. 2, 2017, DHS announced that under its interpretation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 and subsequent amendments, IIRIRA allowed DHS to waive the application of the NEPA, ESA, and many other federal statutes for the purposes of implementing the EO.  Plaintiff claimed that in fact IIRIRA did not authorize this waiver, because its grant of waiver authority to DHS had already expired and had not been renewed.  Plaintiff also alleged that in waiving the applicability of the environmental statutes, defendant had violated IIRIRA, NEPA, and ESA, as well as the U.S. Constitution's Take Care Clause, Separation of Powers Doctrine, Nondelegation Doctrine, and Presentment Clause.</p><p>On Sept. 15, the court related this case to another recent case filed by environmental groups challenging the border wall, <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16176\">Defenders of Wildlife v. Duke</a></i>, following the request of plaintiffs in the latter case.</p><p>On Oct. 6, the government moved to dismiss.  DHS first argued that, according to IIRIRA's waiver provision, the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's nonconstitutional claims.  Moreover, DHS claimed, to the extent the Court could review the statutory claims, the government had not exceeded its authority under its executive power and IIRIRA's waiver provision.  Turning to the constitutional claims, defendant then denied any violations.  Finally, DHS argued that no APA claim existed because FOIA provided an adequate remedy.</p><p>The parties jointly requested on Oct. 20 that this case be consolidated with <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16176\">Defenders of Wildlife v. Duke</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16178\">California v. U.S.</a></i>. On Oct. 24, Judge Curiel granted the motion.   2017 WL 4861650.  The consolidated cases continue on this case page.</p><p>On Nov. 22, all plaintiffs moved separately for summary judgment.  The Center for Biological Diversity and the Animal Legal Defense Fund both argued that the Trump administration had exceeded its statutory authority under IIRIRA (or, in the alternative, its constitutional authority under the Take Care Clause, Presentment Clause, Separation of Powers Doctrine, and Nondelegation Doctrine), by reviving IIRIRA's waiver provision for the new border wall projects.  The State of California advanced a similar argument and also alleged that the Trump administration had violated the APA, NEPA, and Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).</p><p>On Dec. 20, DHS opposed plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment and cross-filed for summary judgment.  First, DHS argued that California had not established standing.   Substantively, DHS argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' constitutional claims under IIRIRA's waiver provision.  DHS also maintained that the provision was constitutional.  Plaintiffs responded on Jan. 5, 2018, and DHS replied on Jan. 23.</p><p>Judge Curiel held a Feb. 9 hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment.  On Feb. 27, he issued an order denying plaintiff's motions for summary judgment and granting DHS's motions for summary judgment, except for plaintiffs' FOIA claim.  First, Judge Curiel held that defendants had violated no clear and unambiguous interpretation of IIRIRA's waiver provision, and therefore that the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear statutory, nonconstitutional claims under that provision.  This bar applied to plaintiffs' statutory claims under IIRIRA, APA, NEPA, ESA, and CZMA.</p><p>Turning next to the constitutional claims, Judge Curiel held that defendants had not violated the Nondelegation and Separation of Powers Doctrines, because Congress had properly delegated its legislative authority under an intelligible principle.  Neither had plaintiffs sufficiently argued that defendants had violated the Take Care Clause, Congress' delegation to the executive of power to waive criminal laws, the Presentment Clause, or the Tenth Amendment.  Further, plaintiffs had not shown that the challenged provision deprived them of their rights under the Due Process Clause, the First Amendment right to petition, or Article III.  284 F.Supp.3d 1092.</p><p>Plaintiffs' FOIA claim survived Judge Curiel's Feb. 27 order.  However, on Mar. 23, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the FOIA claim, because defendants had provided the requested records.  On Mar. 26, Judge Curiel granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice.</p><p>On Apr. 9, plaintiff appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit, which opened a new docket (No. 18-55474). </p><p>On Apr. 19, 2018, the Circuit Court consolidated plaintiff's appeal with appeals from the consolidated cases (No. 18-55475 and 18-55476).</p><p>The Ninth Circuit held oral argument on Aug. 7.</p><p>While the Ninth Circuit's decision was pending, on Aug. 23, plaintiff filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.  The issue that plaintiff requested the Supreme Court to answer was \"whether IIRIRA § 102(c)—which grants the Secretary of Homeland Security sweeping power to waive any or all legal requirements in her sole discretion, and then insulates that exercise of discretion from judicial review—violates the separation of powers.\"</p><p>On Dec. 30, 2018, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari. </p><p>139 S.Ct. 594.</p><p>On Feb. 19, 2019, the Ninth Circuit panel (Circuit Judges M. Margaret McKeown, Consuelo M. Callahan, and Jacqueline H. Nguyen) affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to defendants.  The panel first concluded that the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the \"predicate legal question\" of whether IIRIRA authorized the contested projects.  </p><p>Next, the panel held that under the plain text of the section, the defendants had the authority to construct the projects.  This was because section 102(a) granted the Secretary of the DHS authority to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”  The panel found that the border barrier projects constituted “additional physical barriers\" and are “in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”</p><p>The panel further concluded that the fencing requirements and deadlines in Section 102(b) did not establish limits applicable to Section 102(a); \"Section 102(b)’s provisions for priority projects do not swallow section 102(a)’s independent authorization to build 'additional physical barriers.'\" </p><p>Lastly, the panel held that that the environmental claims were precluded by the Secretary’s waiver of the NEPA, the CZMA, and the APA and that it lacked jurisdiction to consider any argument challenging the waivers themselves.  915 F.3d 1213. </p><p>The judgment of the Ninth Circuit took effect on April 5, 2019. The case is now closed.</p>",

(17cv1215-GPC(WVG))  \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 39   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1335   Page 9 of 29\n \n1  Plaintiffs, the People of the State of California and the California Coastal \n2  Commission (referred to collectively as “California”) submit the following \n3  argument in reply to Defendants’ opposition to California’s motion for summary \n4  judgment and in opposition to Defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment. \n5  ARGUMENT IN REPLY AND OPPOSITION \n6  I.  CALIFORNIA HAS STANDING TO ASSERT EACH OF ITS CLAIMS \n7    In their opposition, Defendants vaguely assert that California fails to tie its \n8  standing theories to claims asserted in its complaint and insinuate, incorrectly, that \n9  California’s standing rests solely on parens patriae theories. Defs.’ Opp’n Summ. J. \n10  (hereinafter Opp’n), Doc. 35-11 at 9–10. Defendants ignore the clear standing \n11  California has in defending its procedural rights under National Environmental \n12  Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure \n13  Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. Plaintiff California Coastal Commission’s \n14  unique regulatory role under the Coastal Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. § \n15  1451 et seq., and the undisputed evidence of California’s concrete interests in the \n16  resources that those procedural rights are intended to protect. In addition, \n17  Defendants’ sole defense to NEPA, APA, and CZMA violations rests on the \n18  validity of waivers that preclude California from enforcing its own laws.  \n19  In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court concluded Massachusetts had standing to \n20  sue the EPA because the state had both procedural rights and concrete, quasi-\n21  sovereign interests in protecting its natural resources. 549 U.S. 497, 519–24 (2007). \n22  Similarly, in Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, the Ninth Circuit held that \n23  California had standing to assert NEPA challenges because it has ownership and \n24  trusteeship over “wildlife, water, State-owned land, and public trust lands.” 646 \n25  F.3d 1161, 1178 (9th Cir. 2011). And, the Supreme Court has held that Plaintiff \n26  California Coastal Commission, which is designated as the “state agency” \n27  responsible for implementing the CZMA over California’s ocean coastline, “clearly \n                                                 \n28  1 All references to “Doc.” are to the ECF document number. \n   1   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J. (17cv1215-GPC(WVG))   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 39   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1336   Page 10 of 29\n \n1  does have standing” to sue the federal government for violations of the CZMA. \n2  Sec’y of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 n.3 (1984) superseded in part \n3  by statute as stated in California v. Norton, 311 F.3d 1162, 1173 (9th Cir. 2002). \n4    Here, California has standing to assert its first and second claims for relief and \n5  to attack all affirmative defenses to those claims because it is being denied \n6  procedural protections guaranteed by NEPA, the CZMA, and the APA, and \n7  California presented unrebutted evidence of its “concrete” interests at stake due to \n8  Defendants’ failure to comply with those statutes. See Cal. Br. at 14–16; Doc. 30-5, \n9  Ex. 23; Docs. 30-7, 30-8, 30-9, 32. California provided evidence of possible harm \n10  to the Tijuana Estuary and to numerous rare, threatened or endangered species \n11  absent adequate environmental review. Id. California also demonstrated potential \n12  harm to the coastal environment. Id. In addition, California presented unrefuted \n13  evidence that it owns property adjacent to the proposed Border Wall Project and \n14  will be financially responsible for managing any effects the Border Wall Project has \n15  on that real property. Id. \n16    California further has standing because states have legally protected sovereign \n17  interests in creating and enforcing their own laws, and Article III standing exists \n18  when federal action interferes with those sovereign interests. Maine v. Taylor, 477 \n19  U.S. 131, 137 (1986) (state had standing because “a state clearly has a legitimate \n20  interest in the continued enforceability of its own statutes”).2 Here, Secretaries \n21  Kelly and Duke executed waivers that purport to waive and prevent the \n22  enforcement of California’s laws and regulations–interfering directly with \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n2 See also Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 65 (1986) (“Because the State \n25  alone is entitled to create a legal code, . . . the State has the kind of ‘direct stake’ . . . \nin defending the standards embodied in that code.”); Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. \n26  Puerto Rico, ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982) (a state’s “easily identified \nsovereign interests” include “the exercise of sovereign power over individuals and \n27  entities within the relevant jurisdiction—this involves the power to create and \nenforce a legal code, both civil and criminal”). \n28 \n   2   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

DEFENDANTS’ ADMISSIONS AND FAILURE TO OFFER A COMPLETE \nDEFENSE ENTITLES CALIFORNIA TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ITS \n4  FIRST AND SECOND CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n5    California is entitled to at least partial summary judgment on its NEPA and \n6  CZMA claims because the San Diego and Calexico Waivers do not provide a \n7  defense to the larger Border Wall Project, which contemplates construction of walls \n8  and other infrastructure at various points along the entire 2000-mile southern \n9  border. Cal. Compl., ¶¶ 1–2, 8, 68, 71–72, 104–10; Cal. Br., Doc. 30-2, at 1, 14–16, \n10  40; Doc. 30-6, Exs. 7, 9; Doc. 30-6, Ex.11; Doc. 35-3 at 2, Fact #2. Defendants also \n11  concede the San Diego Waiver does not provide a defense to California’s NEPA \n12  and CZMA claims concerning Defendants’ publicized plans to replace a secondary \n13  fence in San Diego. Opp’n at 6-7; Doc. 30-5, Ex. 9 at 099; Doc. 35-3 at 34, Fact #2. \n14  Both NEPA (in the form of an environmental impact statement) and the CZMA (in \n15  the form of a consistency determination) mandate public review of a project’s \n16  potential impacts at the earliest possible stage of the planning process. Robertson v. \n17  Methow Valley Citizen Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348–49 (1989); 42 U.S.C. \n18  § 4332(2)(C); 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(2); 15 C.F.R. § 930.36; 40 C.F.R. § 1501.2. \n19  Because the undisputed record proves Defendants have engaged in the planning of \n20  infrastructure projects that fall outside the scope of any waiver and failed to comply \n21  with either act, California is entitled to partial summary judgment on its first and \n22  second claims as a matter of law.   \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n3 While the scope of the waivers’ impact on California’s sovereignty is \n25  obscured by the Secretaries’ failure to identify each California law or regulation \ncovered, the waivers jeopardize California’s enforcement of laws that would subject \n26  DHS or its contractors to the state’s permitting authority or to other legal actions. \nSee, e.g., Cal. Water Code § 13000 et. seq.; Cal. Integrated Waste Mgmt. Act of \n27  1989, Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 4000 et seq., 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 17380 et seq.; Cal. \nHazardous Waste Control Law, Cal. Health and Safety Code § 25100 et seq.; Cal. \n28  Gov. Code § 12600 et seq.; Cal. Civ. Code § 3840. \n   3   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J. (17cv1215-GPC(WVG))   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 39   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1338   Page 12 of 29\n \n1  California also satisfied its burden of demonstrating that Defendants violated \n2  NEPA and the CZMA concerning the prototype and primary fence replacement \n3  projects described in the San Diego and Calexico Waivers. Thus, California is \n4  entitled to summary judgment on its NEPA and CZMA claims unless Defendants \n5  meet their “burden of proving their affirmative defense.” Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d \n6  1162, 1176 (9th Cir. 2014). The only defense Defendants offer is an affirmative \n7  one: that Defendants are excused from NEPA and CZMA compliance because \n8  former Secretaries Kelly and Duke executed waivers under Section 102 of the \n9  Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act (referred to herein as \n10  “IIRIRA” or “Section 102”). Thus, Defendants must prove that Section 102 \n11  authorizes the projects DHS seeks to build and that the San Diego and Calexico \n12  Waivers are valid. Because Defendants have not met their burden, summary \n13  judgment should be granted to Plaintiffs on their first and second claims.  \n14  III.  CALIFORNIA’S THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH CLAIMS \n15  A.  This Court has Jurisdiction to Hear California’s Non-\nConstitutional Claims \n16 \n17  Defendants attempt to extend the limitation on district courts’ jurisdiction in \n18  Section 102(c)(2)(A) to all non-constitutional claims. However, their effort fails for \n19  three reasons. First, Section 102(c)(2)(A) applies only to claims arising from the \n20  Secretary’s actions “pursuant to paragraph (1),” which is the waiver provision in \n21  Section 102(c)(1). 8 U.S.C. § 1103(c) note. Therefore, Section 102(c)(2)(A)’s \n22  limitation on judicial review does not apply to this Court’s jurisdiction over \n23  California’s claims concerning Sections 102(a) and (b).  \n24  Second, Defendants provide no response to California’s argument that courts \n25  retain jurisdiction to address threshold issues governing the application of a statute \n26  to the circumstance at issue—even where a statute purports to limit their \n27  jurisdiction. Iasu v. Smith, 511 F.3d 881, 891 (9th Cir. 2007); Flores-Miramontes v. \n28  INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir. 2000). Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction \n   4   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J. (17cv1215-GPC(WVG))   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 39   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1339   Page 13 of 29\n \n1  over California’s relevant threshold questions, including whether Sections 102(a) \n2  and (b) authorize the San Diego and Calexico Projects.  \n3  Finally, despite Defendants’ arguments to the contrary (Opp’n at 13–14), this \n4  Court has jurisdiction to determine whether DHS exceeded its statutory authority \n5  by issuing the challenged waivers. Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188–90 (1958). \n6  California meets both prongs of the Kyne exception because Section 102 does not \n7  authorize the Secretary’s actions, and the absence of district court jurisdiction will \n8  deprive Plaintiffs of a means of vindicating their rights.4 The Ninth Circuit recently \n9  reaffirmed its jurisdiction to conduct ultra vires review of the Executive’s actions \n10  because “[i]t is the duty of the courts . . . to say where [the] statutory and \n11  constitutional boundaries [of authority conferred by Congress] lie.” Hawaii v. \n12  Trump, No. 17-17168, 2017 WL 6554184, at *6 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017) (finding \n13  ultra vires review available to address claims the Executive exceeded statutory \n14  authority). The court held that courts “necessarily” retain jurisdiction to review \n15  whether executive actions are “ultra vires” and within “the limits of the President’s \n16  power.” Id. at *7. \n17  Without authority, Defendants attempt to distinguish Section 102 from the \n18  overwhelming Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit caselaw allowing for ultra vires \n19  review, claiming that those cases “cannot overturn plainly expressed congressional \n20  intent to prohibit all review other than constitutional claims.” Opp’n at 17. But this \n21  argument ignores that such review is required so an agency does “not construe the \n22  statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to \n23  limit its discretion.” Whitman v.

However, without ultra \nvires review, Plaintiffs would be unable to prevent the Secretary from taking \n26  unchecked actions that exceed statutory authority.

Under Defendants’ argument, DHS could simply ignore Section 102’s \n2  provisions limiting its authority. None of the cases Defendants cite preclude courts \n3  from determining if an agency has acted within the limits of its discretion.5  \n4  For the three reasons stated above, this Court has jurisdiction to consider \n5  whether the Secretary exceeded his or her statutory authority by issuing waivers for \n6  projects not authorized by Section 102. \n7  B.

The San Diego and Calexico Projects are Not Located in \n“Areas of High Illegal Entry”  \n9 \n10  Section 102 authorizes DHS to “install additional physical barriers . . . to deter \n11  illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry” (emphasis added). While Congress \n12  did not set a numeric threshold to define “areas of high illegal entry,” the rules of \n13  statutory construction require a reading that gives these words—including the word \n14  “high”—meaning. Setser v. United States, 566 U.S. 231, 239 (2012) (courts “must \n15  give effect” to “every clause and word” of a statute).  \n16    Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent also direct lower courts to \n17  consider several factors such as the statutory framework, legislative history, and \n18  prior executive practice to construe statutory text.

Defendants seek to \n2  side-step this overwhelming evidence by asking the Court to adopt an interpretation \n3  of the phrase “areas of high illegal entry” that would render those words \n4  meaningless. Defendants contend the limiting phrase “areas of high illegal entry” \n5  should be interpreted by turning to the larger Act’s overall purpose “to achieve and \n6  maintain operational control over the international border.” Opp’n at 44. Further, \n7  Defendants contend that “operational control” means “the prevention of all \n8  unlawful entries into the United States . . .” Opp’n at 2.   \n9  However, the phrase “areas of high illegal entry” must be given effect. \n10  Defendants’ strained interpretation violates this principle because it would \n11  authorize the expedited installation of barriers (by waiving federal and state laws) \n12  anywhere along the southern border as long as the barrier promoted “operational \n13  control,” regardless of whether the barrier was in an area of high illegal entry. \n14  Defendants’ interpretation strips the limiting phrase “areas of high illegal entry” of \n15  any meaning and, for that reason, must be rejected.6  \n16  Further, when read in the context of a statutory framework that has long \n17  allowed the Executive Branch to construct barriers in select areas of the southern \n18  border (see 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(5); Def. Opp. at 31, n.22),7 the phrase “areas of high \n19  illegal entry” must be read as a geographic limitation on DHS’s ability to install \n20 \n                                                 \n6 The absurdity of Defendants’ argument that the Secretary is entitled to \n21  unfettered deference to define “high illegal entry” and “most practical and \neffective” is made clear by simply contrasting the photos of the Border Wall \n22  prototypes built pursuant to the 2017 Waivers, which contain huge gaps in between \nthem, with Defendants’ arguments the prototypes are intended to deter illegal \n23  crossings. Compare Opp’n at 6, 48–49 with images of prototypes (Cal. Br. at 16 \nn.11). \n24  7 The installation of the primary fence in San Diego, which preceded the \nenactment of Section 102 of IIRIRA, serves as a prime example of that general \n25  authority. California does not dispute that the Executive Branch has authority, \nsubject to direction and limitations imposed by Congress, to construct new barriers \n26  and to repair, maintain or replace existing barriers where appropriate. The dispute \nlies with Defendants’ assumption that Section 102 is the statute that authorizes \n27  them to do so and that Section 102 authorizes them to expedite barrier projects \nacross the entire southern border, without limitation. \n28 \n   7   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

See Hawaii, 2017 WL 6554184 at *15–16. The Court therefore should \n7  reject Defendants’ interpretation of “areas of high illegal entry” because it confirms \n8  that Section 102 does not provide an intelligible principle concerning the \n9  Secretary’s use of the waiver provision, is unconstitutionally vague, and does not \n10  survive the heightened scrutiny required for waiving criminal laws. In particular, \n11  Defendants adopt a reading of Section 102 that exposes their mistaken belief that \n12  the Secretary may infringe on state sovereignty in a disparate and unequal fashion \n13  regarding actual levels of illegal entry. The Court should avoid this unconstitutional \n14  invitation.  \n15  Finally, despite the relatively low number of illegal entries in comparison to \n16  sectors in other states, Defendants contend that the 31,000 apprehensions in the San \n17  Diego sector and the 19,000 in the El Centro sector in 2016 do not meet “Congress’ \n18  definition of ‘operational control’” (which equates to zero illegal entries), and that \n                                                 \n19  8 When Congress enacted Section 102 in 1996, it was initially concerned \nwith the extremely high rate of illegal entries in San Diego, which at the time \n20  accounted for nearly one-third of the apprehensions along the southern border. \nCongress never indicated that fencing should be constructed across the entire \n21  southern border or in areas that are not areas of high illegal entry. \n9 As noted in California’s moving papers, the sector-wide apprehension data \n22  and sector-wide drug seizure data cited in the 2017 Waivers are irrelevant in \ndetermining whether the Calexico and San Diego projects are “in areas of illegal \n23  entry.” In Defendants’ opposition, these arguments are largely ignored. Defendants \ncontend simply that members of Congress have cited to DHS sector-wide data and \n24  that California cited data from an outdated report. The most current data publicly \navailable, however, demonstrates Defendants are seeking to expedite a fence \n25  replacement in an area already heavily fortified and where apprehensions are the \nlowest within the sector. Despite having access to more current data concerning \n26  apprehensions in the specific locations of the Projects, and despite having the \nburden of proving their affirmative defense to California’s NEPA and CZMA \n27  claims, Defendants offer nothing. Further, since most drug seizures occur at the \nports of entry or vehicle checkpoints (Doc. 30-6, Ex. 19), Defendants’ reliance on \n28  sector-wide drug seizure data to justify the need for a border wall is disingenuous.  \n   8   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

But the legislative history reveals that \n3  Congress did not consider areas with these apprehension levels to be “areas of high \n4  illegal entry” when it enacted Section 102. For example, in 1996 all but three of the \n5  southern sectors recorded more than 100,000 apprehensions, but Congress only \n6  targeted the San Diego Sector for a 14-mile triple-fence project. Doc. 29-3, Ex. 1 at \n7  1. In 2006, the year preceding Section 102’s last amendment, sectors with much \n8  higher apprehension levels (Del Rio – 42,636 and Laredo - 74,840) compared to \n9  San Diego’s current apprehensions were not identified as problem areas by \n10  Congress or the subsequent target of waivers by DHS. Doc. 29-3, Ex. 1 at 1; Doc. \n11  30-4, Ex. 1 at 018-019; Doc. 30-6, Ex. 10 at 117-8. Thus, the legislative history and \n12  prior executive practice in applying Section 102 demonstrate that the San Diego \n13  and El Centro Sectors are no longer areas of high illegal entry within the meaning \n14  of the statute. \n15  2.  Section 102 Does Not Authorize Replacement Fencing \n16  Section 102 authorizes the “installation of additional physical barriers.” This \n17  Court should apply a plain and ordinary meaning to that text and reject Defendants’ \n18  tortured interpretation of the word “additional.”  \n19  Section 102 authorizes the Executive Branch to install expedited, additional \n20  barriers under exceptional circumstances; Section 102 does not address on-going \n21  maintenance or replacement of existing barriers. This interpretation is supported by \n22  the express language of Section 102 (a) and (b), which instructs DHS in “carrying \n23  out” the general requirements of subsection (a). The 2007 Amendments to Section \n24  102 focus solely on adding mileage to the existing inventory of fencing and \n25  meeting mileage goals. Defendants’ interpretation of the term “additional” is \n26  therefore inconsistent with subsection (b) because the replacement of existing \n27  fences does not aid DHS in meeting those mileage requirements. Defendants’ \n28  interpretation is also inconsistent with their prior practice in carrying out the statute. \n   9   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

The 2017 Waivers are Invalid Because the Secretary’s Waiver \nAuthority Expired on December 31, 2008 (Fourth Claim) \n5 \n6  Defendants argue that the power granted to DHS in Section 102(a) “provides a \n7  general mandate to take action, and that § 102(b) (which contains IIRIRA’s 2008 \n8  deadlines) identifies particular congressional priorities to be pursued.” Opp’n at 28. \n9  Under Defendants’ theory, Section 102(b) “merely identifies [sic] reflects \n10  Congress’s shifting priorities.” Id. at 32. Defendants further argue the sunset date \n11  was only meant to apply to “priority areas.” Id. at 37, 38. Defendants read \n12  subsections (a) and (b) as separate grants of delegated authority.  \n13  But that argument ignores the express statutory language and renders the \n14  deadlines in Section 102(b)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) superfluous. Because subsection (b) \n15  begins with the phrase “in carrying out subsection (a),” the two subsections cannot \n16  be read as two separate grants of authority. Further, by imposing a deadline, Section \n17  102(b)(1)(B)(i) is better understood as providing an outright limitation on the \n18  Secretary’s authority to use the waiver provision. If, as Defendants argue, the \n19  Secretary could always identify additional fencing and issue waivers to \n20  expeditiously construct that fencing, it would violate the well-established rule that, \n21  “[w]hen Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to \n22  have real and substantial effect.” Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 397 (1995).  \n23  The more consistent way to read the amended statute is that Congress in \n24  Section 102(b) directs DHS in how it must carry out Section 102(a) and under what \n25  circumstances the waiver authority may be used to further the goal of expeditious \n26  construction contemplated in Section 102(b)(1)(B)(ii). This is supported by \n27  Defendants’ historical practice, such as Secretary Chertoff’s actions to comply with \n28  the congressional mandate and intent by identifying more than 370 miles of priority \n   10   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

Doc. 30-4, Ex. 5 at ECF pp. 49-51. No Secretary has issued any waivers \n4  since that date until the current 2017 Waivers. Significantly, in each of the previous \n5  waivers the Secretary was following the instructions set-forth in subsection (b); \n6  none strayed outside those specific directives.10 Unlike the previous waivers, \n7  former Secretaries Kelly and Duke did not issue waivers in response to \n8  Congressional direction set forth in subsection (b) and, in fact, have issued waivers \n9  that conflict with deadlines expressed in that subsection. \n10  The limitation on the Secretary’s authority in Section 102(b) is unique because \n11  it only has meaning if applied to fencing projects under the section as a whole. It \n12  reflects congressional intent that Section 102 was not intended to operate in \n13  perpetuity. Lamie v. U.S. Tr., 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004). Congress would have no \n14  reason to limit the Secretary’s authority by imposing deadlines under Section \n15  102(b), if it intended the statute to last in perpetuity. This interpretation is further \n16  consistent with language in Section 102(c)(1) that a waiver may only be used when \n17  “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \n18  section.” Defendants’ interpretation robs the statute of all urgency, eviscerating any \n19  limitations on the Secretary’s authority under Section 102(b)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).  \n20    California is entitled to summary judgment on its Fourth Claim and \n21  Defendants’ sole defense to California’s NEPA and CZMA claims should be \n22  rejected because the waiver authority expired. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n10 For example, the September 2005 waiver followed the directions set forth \n26  in subsection (b) of the initial version of Section 102.

And, the April 2008 waivers were issued in direct response to \nthe subsection (b) deadlines expressed in the current version of Section 102, which \n28  had been amended a few months earlier.

The Secretary’s Failure to Make Sufficient Findings Renders \nthe 2017 Waivers Invalid. \n2 \n3  The Secretary must make sufficient findings to demonstrate the San Diego and \n4  Calexico Projects satisfy Section 102’s requirements that the Projects are \n5  “necessary,” limited to “additional physical barriers and roads,” and in “areas of \n6  high illegal entry” (Section 102(a)). The Projects must also be located where they \n7  would be “most practical and effective” (Section 102(b)). 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note. \n8  Defendants do not dispute that the Secretary failed to determine the Projects \n9  were located where fencing would be “most practical and effective.” They argue \n10  instead that the Secretary adequately met the statutory requirements by making \n11  conclusory statements that simply restate the statutory language that require \n12  findings. Opp’n at 38–41. However, conclusory statements that merely parrot the \n13  statute are inadequate. Dickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1405 (D.C. Cir. \n14  1995). Absent findings that support those conclusions, courts cannot conduct a \n15  meaningful review of the Secretary’s actions. Id.; cf. Hawaii, 2017 WL 6554184 at \n16  *9. This is especially true here, where DHS and its Secretary have made public \n17  statements contradicting any claim that fencing in San Diego or El Centro is \n18  necessary, a priority, or most practical and effective.11 In arguing that the Secretary \n19  need not provide a rationale, Defendants rely on the jurisdictional limitation in \n20  Section 102(c)(2)(A) and the “sole discretion” language in Section 102(c). Opp’n at \n21  39. But those provisions do not address the findings necessary for adequate judicial \n22  review of whether Section 102 authorizes the Projects. The 2017 Waivers’ lack of \n23  those findings renders them invalid. \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n11 DHS asks the court to ignore a March 27, 2017 report (Cal. Ex. 9), \n26  claiming it is “privileged” and “not part of the administrative record.” Opp’n at 50 \nn. 40. But this case is not an appeal of an administrative decision for which a record \n27  is required, and DHS waived any (non-existent) privilege by sharing this report \nexternally.

SECTION 102 AND THE 2017 WAIVERS INTERFERE WITH CALIFORNIA’S \nEQUAL SOVEREIGNTY AND POLICE POWERS IN VIOLATION OF THE \n2  TENTH AMENDMENT (ELEVENTH CLAIM) \n3 \nThe state sovereignty principles enshrined in the Tenth Amendment require \n4 \nthat federal action which burdens a disfavored subset of states or invades states’ \n5 \ntraditional police powers must be “sufficiently related to the problem that it \n6 \ntargets.” Shelby Cty., Ala. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2622 (2013). Defendants do \n7 \nnot seriously engage with this requirement. Instead, they assert that no Tenth \n8 \nAmendment violation occurs where Congress acts pursuant to powers provided by \n9 \nthe Constitution and, in turn, that the 2017 Waivers are a valid delegation of \n10 \ncongressional powers. But the Tenth Amendment is not nearly so anemic, nor are \n11 \nCongress’s powers so expansive as Defendants claim.  \n12 \nDefendants mistakenly assume that the only way to violate the Tenth \n13 \nAmendment is by passing laws that exceed Congress’s limited constitutional \n14 \npowers. But where, as here, the federal government intrudes upon “state \n15 \nsovereignty,” such intrusion violates the Tenth Amendment “even where Congress \n16 \nhas the authority under the Constitution to pass laws.” New York v. United States, \n17 \n505 U.S. 144, 166, 177, 188 (1992); Shelby Cty., 133 S.

Defendants claim \n6  Shelby County “does not stand for the general proposition that constitutionally \n7  enacted statutes become vulnerable whenever there are ‘changed circumstances.’” \n8  Opp’n at 73 (selectively quoting Cal. Br. at 26). But Defendants do not dispute the \n9  proposition for which Shelby County does stand (and for which it was cited): that \n10  “a validly enacted federal statute that burdens a subset of states but not others will \n11  become unconstitutional if progress is made curbing the problem the statute seeks \n12  to prevent.” Cal. Br. at 25 (citing 133 S. Ct. at 2628–29). Nor do Defendants cite a \n13  single case construing Shelby County otherwise. \n14  Defendants do not dispute that illegal crossings in the San Diego and El \n15  Centro Sectors have been substantially reduced and admit that the rates of illegal \n16  entry are “far less” in California than other southern border states. Doc. 35-3 at 28. \n17  As California explained, such progress “cannot be ignored” and shows that \n18  continued federal interference with state sovereignty is no longer justified. Shelby \n19  Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2628. In response, Defendants simply assert that the steep \n20  declines in illegal crossings do not “undermine the legitimacy” of Congress’s “goal \n21  of operational control” or DHS’s “authority [that] Congress delegated to pursue that \n22  goal.”13 Opp’n at 73. But a legitimate goal cannot justify federal intrusion into \n23  states’ sovereignty—if it did, the legitimate goal of racial equality would have \n                                                 \n24  12 See, e.g., Engine Mfrs. Ass’n v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 498 F.3d \n1031, 1042 (9th Cir. 2007). \n25  13 Defendants’ contention that the border “need not be the crisis it was in the \n1990s” to justify the 2017 Waivers is similarly unavailing. Opp’n at 73 (citing Cty. \n26  of El Paso v. Chertoff, 2008 WL 4372693, at *8 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2008)). The \ncase Defendants rely upon did not address the equal sovereignty doctrine and was \n27  decided before Shelby County made clear that the constitutional inquiry focuses on \nwhether “progress has been made”—not whether the problem “still exists.” Shelby \n28  Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2619, 2625.  \n   14   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J.

Rather, a legitimate goal must be pursued using \n2  a “method” that does not impinge on states’ “inviolable sovereignty.” New York, \n3  505 U.S. at 188.  \n4  Here, the method DHS adopted—based on the Secretary’s unfettered \n5  discretion and not on apprehension data—results in the “deprivation of a State’s \n6  sovereign powers.” Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 93 (1985) (holding state could \n7  not be prevented from “vindicating its sovereign authority through enforcement of \n8  its laws”). Defendants’ conjecture that Congress could theoretically treat border \n9  states differently from non-border states (Opp’n at 72) is beside the point because \n10  that is not what happened. The constitutional violation here is the singling out of \n11  California, and such a “departure from the fundamental principle of equal \n12  sovereignty” among the states requires Defendants to prove that DHS’s “disparate \n13  geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” Shelby \n14  Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2622. Defendants have not made that showing here. \n15  Moreover, the 2017 Waivers far exceed Congress’ limited powers under the \n16  Constitution. While Defendants invoke Congress’s inherent power to determine \n17  immigration policy, no case holds that such power permits the Executive to waive \n18  laws of general application—such as California’s environmental, work place safety, \n19  and anti-graft laws—that apply regardless of immigration status. See Hawaii, 2017 \n20  WL 6554184 at *21 (Executive “lacks independent constitutional authority” to act \n21  because “control over the entry of aliens is a power within the exclusive province of \n22  Congress”); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954).  \n23  Finally, Defendants “resort[] to the last, best hope of those who defend ultra \n24  vires” federal action: the Necessary and Proper Clause, which—when coupled with \n25  the Commerce Clause—authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce. \n26  Printz, 521 U.S. at 923–24. But Defendants cannot rely on the Commerce Clause \n27  because the 2017 Waivers do not purport to regulate “economic activity” and lack \n28  the requisite nexus to interstate commerce. United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. \n   15   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J. (17cv1215-GPC(WVG))   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 39   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1350   Page 24 of 29\n \n1  598, 613 (2000). Nor is the Necessary and Proper Clause of any help; the 2017 \n2  Waivers violate California’s sovereignty, and a law that “violates the principle of \n3  state sovereignty . . . is not a ‘La[w] . . . proper for carrying into Execution the \n4  Commerce Clause.” Printz, 521 U.S. at 923–24.14   \n5  V.  SECTION 102(C)’S HURDLES AND THE VAGUE 2017 WAIVERS DEPRIVE \nCALIFORNIA OF FAIR NOTICE AND ACCESS TO THE COURTS (SIXTH \n6  CLAIM) \n7  Defendants attempt to deflect from the 2017 Waivers’ deficiencies by faulting \n8  California for not identifying all state “laws that have actually been waived.” Opp’n \n9  at 72 n.61. But the 2017 Waivers’ failure to specify which laws they waive (leaving \n10  DHS apparently uncertain as to what it has done) only proves that the 2017 Waivers \n11  are unconstitutionally vague. Because they purport to waive more than just the \n12  listed laws, the 2017 Waivers’ scope is unknown.15 Californians and the courts need \n13  more to know “where to draw the line between what is permissible and what is \n14  forbidden.” Hirschkop v. Snead, 594 F.2d 356, 371, 375 (4th Cir. 1979) (code \n15  barring activity that “relates to” specified matters was unconstitutionally vague).  \n16  Defendants’ attempts to moot the issue are unfounded. They now claim that \n17  DHS will “construe” the 2017 Waivers more narrowly. Opp’n at 70. But such post-\n18  hoc interpretations by counsel cannot cure the admitted constitutional violation \n19  here. See Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1165–66 (9th Cir. 2017) (counsel’s \n                                                 \n20  14 Defendants also fail to distinguish City of Boerne v. Flores, which struck \ndown a federal statute that, like Section 102, interfered with states’ traditional \n21  police powers by enabling the nullification of laws that did not impede the statute’s \nobject. 521 U.S. 507, 532–36 (1997). It is no answer to note that the case addressed \n22  “Congress’s power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment” (Opp’n at 73) because \nthe “scope of Congress’ power under § 5 is equivalent to that under the necessary \n23  and proper clause” upon which Defendants rely. EEOC v. Elrod, 674 F.2d 601, 604 \n(7th Cir. 1982); Laro v. New Hampshire, 259 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001). Nor are \n24  Defendants correct that City of Boerne is limited to claims of “sovereign immunity” \n(Opp’n at 73), as the case cited does not stand for that proposition and City of \n25  Boerne never even mentions the term. \n15 We do know, however, that the 2017 Waivers purport to waive unspecified \n26  state and federal laws “related to the subject of” more than two dozen listed laws \nthat run the gamut from protections against religious discrimination, 42 U.S.C. \n27  § 2000bb, to requirements for gravesite preservation, 25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq., to a \nban on an agency’s unauthorized use of funds, 54 U.S.C. § 320106. 82 Fed. Reg. \n28  35,984 (Aug. 2, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829 (Sept. 12, 2017).  \n   16   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J.

Nor are \n3  Defendants correct that few state laws apply to these Projects. Opp’n at 70. In fact, \n4  courts routinely apply California law to federal construction projects. See, e.g., \n5  Harper/Nielsen-Dillingham, Builders, Inc. v. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 667, 679 \n6  (2008) (applying California contract law to suit against federal government).  \n7  Defendants also incorrectly assert that a void-for-vagueness challenge requires \n8  a plaintiff to identify a property or other interest under the Due Process Clause and \n9  that California has failed to do so. But, as Defendants concede (Opp’n at 66 n.53), \n10  California’s challenge is not grounded solely in the Due Process Clause, as a \n11  “regulation may also violate the First Amendment if it is unconstitutionally vague.” \n12  O’Brien v. Welty, 818 F.3d 920, 930 (9th Cir. 2016). The “establishment of a vested \n13  property right is irrelevant” to a challenge that implicates the First Amendment. \n14  Outdoor Media Grp., Inc. v. City of Beaumont, 506 F.3d 895, 903 (9th Cir. 2007). \n15  Regardless, California has established a Due Process interest in the enforcement of \n16  its state laws and the preservation of the “property that it owns and manages \n17  adjacent to DHS’s Border Wall Projects.” Cal. Br. at 13; see Bd. of Regents of State \n18  Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577–78 (1972).  \n19  Finally, Defendants contend that the Petition Clause poses no limit on the \n20  ability to restrict access to the courts in this case, but the authorities cited fail to \n21  support this proposition.16 Those cases do not address the harm here, which is the \n22  complete deprivation of any judicial forum for numerous claims. Moreover, the \n23 \n                                                 \n16 Roller v. Gunn, 107 F.3d 227 (4th Cir. 1997), relates to a prisoner’s challenge to \n24  “filing fee requirement” under “equal protection” clause and did not address the \nPetition Clause. Wilbur v. Locke, 423 F.3d 1101, 1116 (9th Cir. 2005) (addressing \n25  dismissal for failure to join indispensable party where plaintiffs “never sought to \namend their complaint” to include party to the contract that they tried to void), \n26  abrogated by Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413 (2010), concludes that \nthe plaintiffs’ own error deprived them of a federal forum. And, Nunag-Tanedo v. \n27  E. Baton Rouge Par. Sch. Bd., 711 F.3d 1136, 1137–38 (9th Cir. 2013), the court \ndetermined that judicial review was merely delayed, not denied. \n28   \n   17   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

Locke, upon which Defendants rely, because \n2  the expansion of federal jurisdiction solely to extinguish state court jurisdiction \n3  must be questioned and statutes must give “proper respect for state functions.” \n4  Levin, 560 U.S. at 420–23 (“Statutes conferring federal jurisdiction, we have \n5  repeatedly cautioned, should be read with sensitivity to ‘federal-state relations.’”). \n6  VI.  SECTION 102(C) AND THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE ARTICLE I, SECTION \n3, OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (NINTH CLAIM)  \n7 \n8  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs identify no constitutional provision or case \n9  demonstrating that the Executive Branch’s power in the area of criminal law is \n10  more restrained than when it acts concerning civil law. Opp’n at 57. However, the \n11  Constitution carefully delineates and limits the power of the Executive to act in the \n12  criminal law sphere. Article I §§ 2, 3. Supreme Court cases also have constrained \n13  the Executive’s power to pardon individuals prior to committing a criminal act and \n14  the power of the Executive to circumvent criminal law and procedure. United States \n15  v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 707–08 (1974); Ex Parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87, 119–20 \n16  (1925).  \n17  Further, contrary to Defendants’ allegations, the Supreme Court has \n18  recognized constraints on congressional delegations in the criminal sphere. In \n19  Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 249–50 (1947), United States v. L. Cohen \n20  Grocery, 255 U.S. 81, 89–92 (1921), and Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, \n21  373 n.7 (1989), the Court recognized that more may be needed from Congress when \n22  a criminal statute is involved. In addition, in Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475, the \n23  Supreme Court recognized that in congressional delegations the “degree of agency \n24  discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power \n25  congressionally conferred.” If Congress wishes to waive a criminal law, it has the \n26  power to do so and can provide the Executive the power to carry out the waiver \n27  under certain circumstances. But Congress cannot circumvent the Constitution and \n28  allow the Executive to choose, in advance, which criminal laws to waive and when \n   18   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ.

THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE \nTHE NON-DELEGATION DOCTRINE, AND THE PRESENTMENT CLAUSE \n4  (SEVENTH, EIGHTH AND TENTH CLAIMS)  \n5  Although Defendants allegedly address California’s Separation of Powers \n6  claim in their argument related to the non-delegation doctrine, they ignore the \n7  additional constitutional problems with Section 102 related to Separation of \n8  Powers. The Supreme Court does articulate the non-delegation doctrine to cover \n9  most instances of delegation of legislative power to the Executive, but it limits that \n10  doctrine in cases where Congress provides the Executive power to decide which \n11  tariffs, or laws, could be modified or terminated and under what circumstances. \n12  Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892); J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 \n13  U.S. 394 (1928). In those instances, delegation does not violate Separation of \n14  Powers if the Executive is “the mere agent of the lawmaking department to \n15  ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to take effect.” \n16  J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 411. The Supreme Court has therefore upheld statutes \n17  where Congress legislated in the “contingency.” Id. at 410. \n18  However, unlike the legislation involved in Field or J.W. Hampton, or even \n19  the original version of Section 102, the current version of Section 102 authorizes \n20  the Secretary to pick and choose among enacted laws and determine, in his or her \n                                                 \n21  17 Defendants simply brush off as unimportant the Secretary’s waiver of two \nserious criminal laws, which can no longer be used to prosecute criminal actions \n22  that harm Californians. While recognizing the two examples mentioned by \nCalifornia, Defendants do not seem to acknowledge that these were simply \n23  examples and the Secretary in fact waived more than a half-dozen criminal laws. \nSee, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1540(b)(1); 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(5); 33 U.S.C. § 401; 42 \n24  U.S.C. § 7413(1); 16 U.S.C. § 707; 42 U.S.C. § 300; 16 U.S.C. § 668. \n18 Defendants contend, without support, that only the delegation of imposing \n25  criminal sanctions concerned the Supreme Court in Fahey, not the authority to lift \ncriminal sanctions. Opp’n at 58 n.47. The seriousness with which the Supreme \n26  Court has treated Presidential immunity from criminal law and procedure and the \nproposition that no one is above the law, makes clear that whatever distinction \n27  exists between those powers, it is without a difference in the case of delegation of \npower. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707–08; Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 165–66 \n28  (1803); United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220 (1882).  \n   19   \nCalifornia’s Reply in Support of California’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross \nMotion for Summ. J.

In enacting Section 102, Congress did not \n2  state which laws are to be waived or why, and instead gave the Executive Branch \n3  that authority. Section 102 was not legislated in the contingency, and Congress \n4  could not know which laws were going to be waived when it enacted the law, nor \n5  did the President when he signed the law. Since Defendants have chosen to not \n6  even address this additional violation, this waiver authority must be declared \n7  unconstitutional and the 2017 Waivers must be invalidated. \n8  With regard to California’s remaining Eighth and Tenth Claims for Relief, \n9  California agrees with co-Plaintiffs’ arguments in their reply briefs that Section \n10  102(c) violates the Non-Delegation Doctrine and the Presentment Clauses. To avoid \n11  duplication, California adopts those arguments herein by reference.  \n12  CONCLUSION \n13  Based on the foregoing, California is entitled to summary judgment on each of \n14  its claims for declaratory relief.  \n \n15  Dated:  January 5, 2018  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \n16  XAVIER BECERRA \nAttorney General of California \n17   \n18 \n19 \n20 \ns/ MICHAEL P.

Plaintiffs, the People of the State of California and the California Coastal \n6  Commission ( collectively \"California\"), have brought this action to require the \n7  Trump administration to comply with the United States Constitution and federal \n8  and state laws. Defendants 1 have already violated the National Environmental \n9  Policy Act2 (\"NEPA\"), the Coastal Zone Management Act3 (\"CZMA\") and the \n1o    Administrative Procedure Act4 (\"APA  \"), but claim to have waived those statutes \n11  and other laws designed to provide invaluable information to California and its \n12  citizens concerning threats to their environment, health, and natural resources. \n13  Defendants contend that NEPA, the CZMA, and numerous other federal and \n14  state laws were waived by former and acting DHS Secretaries on August 2, 2017 \n15  (\"San Diego Waiver\") and September 12, 2017 (\"Calexico Waiver\") for the \n16  planning and construction of a border wall and related border barrier projects along \n17  the southwest border, including significant projects in California (\"Border Wall \n18  Projects\"). These waivers (\"2017 Waivers\") cite 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, commonly \n19  referred to as Section 102 (\"Section 102\"), as the source of the Secretary's authority \n20  to construct the Border Wall Projects and waive any and all laws related to the \n21  them. \n22  However, Defendants' reliance on Section 102 to build the Border Wall \n23  Projects and waive laws related to that construction is misplaced. Section 102 \n24 \n1 Defendants include the United States of America, the U.S. Department of \n25  Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), former DHS Secretary John Kelly in his official \ncapacity, acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke in her official capacity, the U.S. \n26  Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), and acting CBP Commissioner Kevin K. \nMcAlsenan in his official capacity ( collectively, .\"Defendants\"). \n27  42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. \n.  3 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq. \n28  4 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. \n1 \nCalifornia Pis.'

Defendants are choosing to \n3  ignore the threshold requirements and limitations Congress laid out in that statute. \n4  Section 102, for example, limits the Secretary's authority to the installation of \n5  \"additional\" barriers in \"areas of high illegal entry\" and where the barriers would be \n6  \"most practical and effective\" in deterring illegal entries. The undisputed facts \n7  establish that the Border Wall Projects at issue in the 2017 Waivers are not in areas \n8  of high illegal entry or located where they would be most practical and effective, \n9  despite the Secretary's conclusory statements to the contrary. Defendants are trying \n10  to shoehorn these particular projects into a statute that was not drafted for these \n11  purposes, simply to take advantage of the statute's waiver provision. \n12  Moreover, Defendants are relying on a waiver and expedited construction \n13  provision that expired nine years ago. In late 2007, Congress amended Section 102 \n14  by imposing a deadline for the identification and expedited construction of barriers \n15  in priority areas. That deadline expired on December 31, 2008. The amendments \n16  reflect that Section 102 was not intended to give the Secretary unilateral authority \n17  to waive all laws along a two-thousand-mile border in perpetuity. Thus, Defendants \n18  cannot now rely on the expedited construction provision nine years after the \n19  deadline to expedite construction in priority areas expired. \n20.  Finally, Section 102 and DHS 's application of that provision through the 2017 \n21  Waivers violate several provisions of the United States Constitution and long-\n22  standing constitutional doctrines. By burdening some geographic regions but not \n23  others and invading California's traditional police powers, in the absence of \n24  evidence justifying the targeted application of the waiver in particular areas of San \n25  Diego and Imperial Counties, the 2017 Waivers fly in the face of the federalism \n26  principles embodied in the Tenth Amendment. Moreover, the vagueness of the \n27  2017 Waivers, combined with Section 102(c  )'s unreasonable procedural hurdles, \n28  contravene the due process rights of all Californians to petition their government \n2 \nCalifornia Pis.'

Section 102 also unconstitutionally effects a wholesale \n2  transfer of legislative duties to the executive by empowering the Secretary with \n3  unchecked discretion to pick and choose which laws to obey or ignore without any \n4 .  meaningful guidance on how to exercise that discretion, in violation of the \n5  Separation of Powers Doctrine, the Non-Delegation Doctrine, and the Presentment \n6  Clause. Finally, in permitting the Secretary to waive all criminal laws, Section 102 \n7  exceeds constitutional limits on the ability of the Executive Branch to immunize \n8  criminal acts. \n9  Defendants are exploiting these constitutional deficiencies through the 2017 \n10  Waivers, which waive a myriad of federal and unidentified state laws, including \n11  criminal laws, in order to construct various projects in areas where fencing already \n12  exists and the rates of illegal entries are the lowest. Section 102 and the 2017 \n13  Waivers cannot be used to trample on the rights of the sovereign State of California \n14  and the rights of its residents. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to summary judgment. \n15  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n16  On January 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order \n17  directing the DHS Secretary to take steps toward planning and constructing a \n18  \"physical wall along the southern border.\" (Ex. 7, Exec. Order No. 13767, 82 Fed. \n19  Reg. 8,793 § 4(a) (Jan. 25, 2017).)5 President Trump referenced a purported \"recent \n20  surge in illegal immigration\" and mandated that DHS \"[p ]roduce a comprehensive \n21  study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this \n22  order, that shall include the current state of southern border security.\" Id.§§ 1, 4(a), \n23  ( d). The Secretary never produced the study mandated by the Executive Order. \n24  However, DHS has issued reports and statements showing that existing \n25  infrastructure, along with staffing and other border technology, has curtailed illegal \n26  crossings at the southwest border, which plummeted years ago. These reports also \n27 \n5 Each exhibit referenced in this memorandum is attached to and described in \n28  the Declaration of Michael Cayaban, filed herewith in support of Plaintiffs' motion. \n3 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. ForSumm. J.

Illegal Entries Plummeted Long Ago. at the Southwest \nBorder \n6 \n7  In DHS 'sown words, illegal entries along the southwest border are at their \n8  lowest levels \"since 2000, and likely since the early 1970s.\" (Ex. 8, \"Efforts by \n9  DHS to Estimate Southwest Border Security Between Ports of Entry,\" Dep't of \n10  Homeland Sec., Office of Immigration Statistics, Sept. 2017, pp. 19.) In the \n11  September 2017 report supporting that assessment, DHS estimated that the number \n12  of successful illegal entries at the southern border has declined by 91 % since 2000. \n13  Id. pp. 17-18. DHS's assessment is consistent with data published by CBP, which \n14  show that the number of migrants apprehended by CBP while illegally crossing the \n15  southwest border has fallen sharply since 2000, and particularly since 2006. (Ex. 2, \n16  USBP Total Illegal Alien Apprehensions by Month, 2000-2016.)6 According to \n17  DHS, illegal border crossings have declined because \"the southwest land border is \n18  more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before.\" (Ex. 8, p. 19.) \n19  B.  Personnel and Infrastructure Have Ballooned in the \nSan Diego and El Centro Sectors \n20 \n21  Since Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n22  Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), the federal government has spent billions \n23  of dollars on personnel and other resources along the southwest border, especially \n24  in the San Diego and El Centro sectors affected by the Border Wall Projects. (Ex. 3, \n25  Congressional Research Service, Border Security: Barriers Along the U.S. \n26  6 The CBP and its enforcement arm, the United States Border Patrol \n(\"P~BP\"), maintain <la.ta on the number of illegal entrants apprehended crossing \n27  w1thm each CBP sector of the southwest border. (Ex. 1, excerpts from Government \nAccountability Office Report; February 2017, GA0-17-331, pp. 1, 46-56, Ex. 2.) \n28  The southwest border is diviaed into nme sectors.  (Ex. 1, pp. 45-46; Ex. 2.) \n4 \nof \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp.  Mot. For Summ. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.741   Page 16 of 51\n1  International Border, September 21, 2006, pp. 3-4.) Between 1995 and 2016, the \n2  number of border patrol agents assigned to the southwest border nearly quadrupled \n3  from 4,388 to 17,026 agents. During that same time, El Centro patrol agent staffing \n4  levels increased by nearly 500%. By 2016, nearly 900 more patrol agents were \n5  assigned to the San Diego sector than in 1995. (Ex. 4, USBP Border Patrol Agent \n6  Staffing by Fiscal Year (as of Oct. 1, 2016), pp. 1-4.) \n7  CBP has also installed hundreds of miles of additional barriers along the \n8  southwest border pursuant to Congressional mandates, including an amendment to \n9  Section 102 requiring expedited construction in priority areas before the end of \n10  2008. CBP installed 143 miles of fencing along the southwest border before late \n11  2005. By the middle of 2009, CBP had installed an additional 490 miles of fencing. \n12  (Ex. 5, U.S. Government Accountability Office, GA0-09-896, Sept. 2009.) \n13  Currently, there are 705 miles of fencing along 654 miles of the U.S.-Mexico \n14  border. (Ex. 6, USBP, Mileage of Pedestrian and Vehicle Fencing, August 2, 2017.) \n15  This includes CBP 's installation of 3 7 miles of secondary fencing and 14 miles of \n16  tertiary fencing, completing the goal of 700 miles as contemplated in Section 102. \n17  Id. \nC.  The Sites for the Border Wall Projects Are No \n18  Longer High Priority \n19  Citing the decline in illegal crossings and adequacy of existing barriers, the \n20  federal government and the Secretary have concluded that areas with existing· \n21  fencing-such as the San Diego and El Centro sectors-are no longer areas of high \n22  illegal entry and that the San Diego and El Centro areas are DHS's lowest priority \n23  for replacing existing fencing. In a March 27, 2017, infrastructure planning \n24  document relating to the Border Wall Project, CBP divided the southwest border \n25  into nine sectors and assessed the infrastructure needs within each sector. (Ex. 9, \n26  Dep't of Homeland Security, Building the Wall, Strategy & Way Forward, March \n27  27, 2017, p. 15.) Each sector was rated as \"Very High,\" \"High,\" and \"Moderate.\" \n28  Id.  CBP used its lowest priority rating, \"moderate,\" to describe its infrastructure \n5 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.

Id. \n2  In a televised interview a month later, then Secretary Kelly confirmed this \n3  assessment, explaining that existing fencing is \"very, very effective\" and \n4  \"remarkably effective in keeping down the amount of illegal movement across\" the \n5  border.7 Notably, most of California's 140-mile border with Mexico already has \n6  fencing, including the areas covered by the 2017 Waivers. (Ex. 1, pp. 46-50; Ex. 10, \n7  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Border Fencing as of June 2011.) Despite the \n8  admitted adequacy of existing barriers and sharp decrease in illegal crossings, DHS \n9  is attempting to expedite the replacement of existing fencing in the San Diego and \n10  El Centro sectors. \n11  1.  The San Diego Sector and the San Diego Waiver \n12  On August 2, 2017, former DHS Secretary Kelly issued the San Diego Waiver \n13  by publishing a Notice of Determination in the Federal Register. (Ex. 11, 82 Fed. \n14  Reg. 35,984-01 (Aug. 2, 2017).) The San Diego Waiver purports to waive 37 \n15  federal laws-including NEPA, the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), the CZMA, \n16  and the AP A-as well as \"all federal, state, or other laws ... related to\" the same \n17  \"subject matter.\" Id. The ostensible purpose of the San Diego Waiver is to expedite \n18  the construction of infrastructure projects within a 15-mile segment of the border \n19  described as the \"project area,\" beginning at the Pacific Ocean and extending \n20  eastward. Id. \n21  The San Diego Waiver states that DHS will \"immediately implement various \n22  border infrastructure projects\" within the project area, but only identifies two \n23  projects expressly: the replacement of the 14-mile primary fence and the \n24  construction of prototype barriers. Id. DHS and Trump Administration officials \n25  have stated they intend to also begin projects that are not specifically mentioned in \n26 \n7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPMt5mxyBQw, Televised Interview \n27  with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and then Homeland Security Secretary John \nKelly (\"Kelly TV Interview\"), April, 20 2017, 2:10-2:27 (last viewed Nov. 19, \n28  2017). \n6 \nCalifornia Pis.'

(Ex. 9, p. 18.) \n3  The various infrastructure projects referenced in the San Diego Waiver, both \n4  disclosed and undisclosed, are referenced collectively herein as the San Diego \n5  Project. \n6  The San Diego sector is located entirely within California and extends 60 \n7  miles east from the Pacific Ocean along the southwest border. (Ex. 1, pp. 46-48.) \n8  The San Diego sector includes several land ports of entry, several inland \n9  checkpoints, and hundreds of miles of coastline. 8 The San Diego sector has about \n10  46 miles of existing primary fencing along its 60-mile border with Mexico. (Ex. 1, \n11  p. 48; Ex. 6, Ex. 10.) Multiple layers of fencing (primary, secondary, and tertiary) \n12  span the western-most segment of the border at the site of the San Diego Project. \n13  (Ex. 1, p. 48; Exs. 23 and 24, Photographs of the San Diego Triple Fence; \n,r,r \n14  Declaration ofM. Cayaban,  24-26; Ex. 22, Appendix D.) \n15  The number of illegal entries in the San Diego sector has fallen significantly \n16  over the last two decades and at a steeper rate than in other sectors. (Ex. 1, pp. 46-\n17  47; Ex. 2; Ex. 8, pp. 18-19.)9 CBP's apprehension data indicates there were 483,815 \n18  in 1996 compared to 31,891 in 2016, a reduction of over 93%. (Ex, 2, pp. 1, 17; Ex. \n19  22, pp. 12-15 and appendix G.) San Diego sector apprehensions fell to just 7% of \n20  the total number of apprehensions along the entire southwest border between 2013 \n21  and 2015, far less than sectors in other states. (Ex. 1, pp. 45-46, 48; Ex. 2; Ex. 6, p. \n22  19; Ex. 20, p. 19-20.) Additionally, personnel from the Imperial Beach and Chula \n23  Vista patrol stations, which have had the lowest rates of illegal entry within the San \n24  Diego Sector for several years, patrol the San Diego Project Area. (Ex. 22, \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.

The El Centro Sector and the Calexico Waiver \n4  On September 12, 2017, acting Secretary Duke issued the Calexico Waiver by \n5  publishing a Notice of Determination in the Federal Register. (Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. \n6  42,829-01 (Sept. 12, 2017).)  The Calexico waiver purports to waive the application \n7  of 27 federal laws, and all state laws related to the same subject matter, in order to \n8  expedite the construction of infrastructure projects in the El Centro sector. As with \n9  the San Diego Waiver, the Calexico Waiver purports to waive NEPA, the CZMA, \n10  and the APA. Id. The ostensible purpose of the Calexico Waiver is to expedite the \n11  replacement of three miles of existing primary fence near the Calexico port of entry \n12  in the El Centro sector, referred to herein as the Calexico Project. \n13  CBP's El Centro sector covers areas within Imperial County and Riverside \n14  County, California.10 The sector is comprised of a land border that is 70 miles in \n15  length with 59 miles of existing primary fencing along its border with Mexico. Id. \n16  Just as in the San Diego sector, there have also been significant declines in the \n17  number of undocumented entries in the El Centro sector over the last two decades. \n18  The USBP apprehended 238,126 deportable migrants in the El Centro sector in \n19  2000 compared to just 19,448 in 2016, a reduction of nearly 92%. (Ex. 2, pp. 1, 17.) \n20  Between 2013 and 2015, apprehensions in the El Centro sector represented just 4% \n21  of the total number of apprehensions along the entire southwest border.

That changed when Congress passed the \n5  first iteration of Section 102. See IIRIRA, Pub. L. 104-208, div. C., tit. I § 102, 110 \n6  Stat. 3009, 3009-554 (Sept. 30, 2996). The first iteration of Section 102 authorized \n7  the U.S. Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of Immigration \n8  and Naturalization, to \"take such actions as may be necessary to install additional \n9  physical barriers and roads .. in the vicinity of the United States border to deter \n1o    illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\" Id. Section \n11  102(a). It also required construction of second and third fences parallel to a 14-mile \n12  segment of primary fencing installed a few years earlier along the border near San \n13  Diego. That 14-mile segment starts at the Pacific Ocean and extends 14 miles east. \nl 4  Id.  § l 02(b ). Further, the first iteration of Section 102 contained a provision that \n15  permitted the Attorney General to waive application of the ESA and NEPA \"to the \n16  extent the Attorney General determines necessary to ensure expeditious \n17  construction of the barriers and roads under this section.\" Id.  § 102(c). \n18  The Real ID Act of 2005 amended Section 102 by transferring the waiver \n19  authority from the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \n20  expanding the waiver authority to include \"all legal requirements such Secretary, in \n21  such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious \n22  construction of the barriers and roads under this section.\" Pub. L. 109-113, div. B, \n23  tit. I § 102( c )(1 ), 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). That version of Section 102 did not \n24  specify the laws that Congress authorized the Secretary to waive. It also purported \n25  to limit legal challenges concerning any waiver decision to constitutional claims \n26  and eliminated appellate court review. Id. \n27  The Secure Fence Act of2006 (Pub. L. 109-367) amended Section 102 again \n28  by removing the provisions referring specifically to the 14-miles of fencing in San \n9 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.

Pub. L. 109-\n3  367, §§ 2-3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006). \n4  The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008 (\"2008 \n5  Amendment\") amended Section 102 a third and final time by removing \n6  requirements for doubled-layered fencing in specific locations, and by providing the \n7  Secretary with specific direction in \"carrying out subsection ( a)\" of Section 102. \n8  Pub. L. 110-161, div E, tit. V, § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007). The 2008 \n9  Amendment directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct reinforced \n10  fencing along not less than 700 miles along the southern border where it would be \n11  \"most practical and effective.\" The 2008 Amendment also amended the statute by \n12  compelling the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate \"Priority Areas\" for \n13  3 70 miles of additional fencing by not later than December 31, 2008, and by \n14  obligating the Secretary to expedite the construction of fencing in these \"priority \n15  areas,\" requiring the completion of construction by not later than December 31, \n16  2008. Id.  Thus, Congress imposed a December 31, 2008, deadline for the \n17  designation and expedited construction of additional barriers and roads in priority \n18  areas under Section 102. \n19  There have.been no amendments to Section 102 since the 2008 Amendment \n20  was signed into law. Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 102 currently state that: \n21  (a)  Jn General. -The SecretarY. ofHomel.aµd Security shall \ntake such actions as may be necessary to mstall addit10nal physical \n22  barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of \nillegal entrants) in the vicimty of the United States border to deter \n23  illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States. \n24  (b)  Construction of Fencing and Road Improvements Along the \nBorder.-\n25 \n( 1)  Additional fencing along southwest border.-\n26 \n(A)  Reinforced fencing.- In carrying out subsection (a), the \n27  Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced fencing along \nnot less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be \n28  most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional \n10 \nCalifornia Pis.'

Id.  § 1103 note. \n16  During the period of September 2005 through October 2007, former Secretary \n17  Chertoff initiated three waivers to expedite the construction of additional fencing in \n18  different project areas. (Ex. 13, 70 Fed. Reg. 55,622.:02 (Sept. 22, 2005); Ex. 14, 72 \n19  Fed. Reg. 2,535-01 (Jan. 19, 2007); Ex. 15, 72 Fed. Reg. 60,870-01 (Oct. 26, \n20  2007).) This resulted in the completion of the 14-mile, multi-layered fencing project \n21  in San Diego and the completion of additional fencing in two project areas in \n22  Arizona. In April 2008, following the 2008 Amendment to Section 102, former \n23  Secretary Chertoff initiated two more waivers in an effort to construct the \n24  additional fencing before the December 31, 2008 deadline. (Ex. 16, 73 Fed. Reg. \n25  19,077-01 (Apr. 8, 2008); Ex·. 17, 73 Fed. Reg. 19078-01 (Apr. 8, 2008).) As \n26  justification for the April,2008 waivers, which called for the expedited construction \n27  of hundreds of miles of fencing in the four southern border states, former Secretary \n28  Chertoff cited Congressional mandates articulated under subsection (b) of Section \n11 \nCalifornia Pis.'

Plaintiffs' \n8  statutory claims include claims for relief under NEPA, the CZMA, and the APA  . \n9  In defense of their failure to comply with these and other federal and state \n10  laws, Defendants assert that these laws were waived by the DHS Secretary in the \n11  2017 Waivers pursuant to Section 102(c). 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note (c)(l). Defendants \n12  also contend that this Court is barred from hearing statutory and other non-\n13  constitutional challenges to the 2017 Waivers, citing language in 102 (c) that \n14  appears to limit the district court's jurisdiction to claims asserting constitutional \n15  violations. Id. \n16  Defendants' position, however, conflicts with Supreme Court and Ninth \n17  Circuit precedent. Federal courts clearly retain jurisdiction to review threshold \n18  issues such as whether underlying factual findings would trigger the purported \n19  jurisdictional bar. Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe, 292 F.3d 1209, 1212 (9th Cir. 2002); \n20  Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir. 2000). In other words, the \n21  federal courts \"have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists.\" \n22 .  Gutierrez v. Holder, 662 F.3d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Flores-\n23  Miramontes, 212 F.3d at 1135). Here, Plaintiffs assert that Section 102 does not \n24  authorize Defendants' proposed projects and thus that the entire st_atute, including \n25  the waiver provision, is inapplicable. These claims require this Court to examine \n26  these threshold issues before it reaches questions such as whether the 2017 Waivers \n27  comply with the Constitution. \n28 \n12 \nCalifornia Pis.'

La. Pub. Serv. \n3  Comm 'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986). Even where Congress has limited \n4  courts' jurisdiction to review an agency's actions, federal courts retain jurisdiction \n5  where: (1) an agency's action is ultra vires in that it contravenes clear statutory \n6  language; and (2) absent district court jurisdiction, the party seeking review would \n7  be wholly deprived of \"a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its \n8  statutory rights.\" Pac.

Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188-90 (1958). Here, \n11  Plaintiffs assert Defendants are acting outside the scope of their authority granted \n12  by Section 102, as defined by clear statutory language, and, the absence of district \n13  court jurisdiction will wholly deprive Plaintiffs of adequate means to vindicate their \n14  statutory rights. \n15  CALIFORNIA HAS ARTICLE III STANDING \n16  \"[T]o satisfy Article Ill's standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it \n17  has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual \n18  or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \n19  challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely \n20  speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Friends of \n21  the Earth, Inc. v.

Finally, the \n3  waivers infringe upon California's procedural and sovereign rights in creating and \n4  enforcing its own laws and receiving the benefits afforded to it under NEPA and the \n5  CZMA. California therefore has Article III standing to bring this case. \n6  ARGUMENT \n7  I.

Cal. Pub. Res. Code§§ 30008; 30330. When a federal agency \n16  undertakes an activity that affects any land, water uses, or natural resources of the \n17  coastal zone, the CZMA requires that agency to provide a \"consistency \n18  determination\" to the Commission that confirms the activity is consistent to the \n19  maximum extent practicable with the California Coastal Management Program. 16 \n20  U.S.C. §§ 1456(c)(l)(A); 15 C.F.R. §§ 930.32, 9320.36, 930.39. \n21  For the San Diego Project, a consistency determination is required because it \n22  will affect numerous resources in the coastal zone, including endangered species, \n23  water quality, public recreation and access to open space, the coast's scenic and \n,r,r \n24  visual quality, and archaeological resources.

See Norton, 311 F .3d at 1169-70, 1178 (setting aside \n4  approval of offshore lease suspensions because federal government failed to \n5  undertake consistency review of the suspensions pursuant to the CZMA); 5 U.S.C. \n6  § § 706(1 ), 706(2)(A) & (D). \n7  Ill.  NOTHING IN SECTION 102 AUTHORIZES THE BORDER WALL PROJECTS \n(THIRD CLAIM) \n8 \n9  The 2017 Waivers seek to waive laws for projects that are not authorized by \n10  Section 102. In relying on the waiver provision in Section 102(c  ), Defendants put \n11  the cart before the horse; because the Border Wall Projects are not authorized by \n12  Section 102(a ) or (b ), DHS has no authority to build the projects, and any waiver \n13  under Section 102(c ) cannot save the Defendants' illegal activity. Here, the Border \n14  Wall Projects fail to satisfy three requirements in Section 102(a) and (b), namely, \n15  that projects be built: (1) in areas of high illegal entry; (2) as additional barriers, not \n16  as replacements for existing fencing; and (3) where the barriers are most practical \n17  and effective. Defendants' failure to satisfy any one of these requirements renders \n18  their actions unlawful and is a basis for summary judgment. 11 \n19  A.  Section 102 Is Inapplicable Because the San Diego \nand Calexico Projects Are Not Located in \"Areas of \n20  High Illegal Entry\" \n21  Contrary to what might be gleaned from President Trump's Executive Order, \n22  Section 102 does not authorize the construction of a wall across the entire two-\n23  thousand-mile southwest border. The plain language of Section 102 only authorizes \n24  the Secretary to install additional physical barriers \"to deter illegal crossings in \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n16 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. ofMot. For Summ. J.

To support this assertion, the San \n4  Diego Waiver points to the amount of drugs seized and number of persons \n5  apprehended during the last fiscal year throughout the entire San Diego sector. (Ex. \n6  11.) The Calexico Waiver points to similar sector-wide data from the El Centro \n7  sector. (Ex. 12.) Reliance on such sector-wide data is misplaced because it fails to \n8  show that the San Diego and Calexico Project Areas are themselves areas of high \n9  illegal entry. \n10  First, the amount of drugs seized by border patrol agents in a sector says \n11  nothing about whether a particular segment of that sector is an area of high illegal \n12  entry. Large drug seizures often occur far from the Mexican border at highway \n13  checkpoints, during vehicle searches at the points of entry, or when border patrol \n14  agents discover a drug-smuggling boat or drone. (Ex. 19, DHS Press Releases and \n15  Media Report Concerning USBP Drug Seizures in San Diego and El Centro \n16  Sectors.) Nothing suggests such seizures occurred at the segments of the border \n17  targeted for the San Diego and Calexico Projects, much less that the amount of \n18  drugs seized correlates with the number of illegal entries there. \n19  Second, sector-wide apprehension data does not establish that the project areas \n20  themselves are areas of high illegal entry. The Calexico Project Area represents \n21  only about 4 % of the total 70-mile border in the El Centro sector. The San Diego \n22  Project Area represents just 1/4 of the 60-mile border within the San Diego sector. \n23  Moreover, the Secretary offers no factual findings to demonstrate that these two \n24  areas are priority areas within the San Diego and El Centro sectors. \n25  The sector-wide apprehension figures are even less probative when one \n26  considers that the San D1ego Project Area has fewer illegal border crossings than \n27  the San Diego sector as a whole. DHS maintains apprehension data for the stations \n28  responsible for specific segments of the border, but the 2017 Waivers do not \n17 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.754   Page 29 of 51\n1  mention this information. The reason for this omission is obvious: the most recent, \n2  publicly available, station-specific apprehension data demonstrates that the number \n3  of illegal entries is much lower in the San Diego Project Area, which is patrolled by \n4  the Imperial Beach and Chula Vista Stations, than in the San Diego sector as a \n5  whole. (Ex. 3, pp. 8-12; Ex. 20, pp. 19-20; Ex. 22, pp. 10-15 and app. G.) This is \n6  unsurprising given that the San Diego Project Area is already the most heavily \n7  fortified area along the entire southwest border, with at least two layers of fencing \n8  along a 14-mile segment and three layers of fencing in certain areas. (Ex. 1, p. 48, \n9  Ex. 22, pp. 10-15 and app. D; Exs, 23-24, Photographs of Triple Fence; Declaration \n,r,r \n10  ofM. Cayaban,  24-26; Exs. 3, 6, 10.) \n11  Further, to the extent sector-wide data is relevant, DHS 's apprehension records \n12  show that the San Diego and El Centro sectors are no longer areas of high illegal \n13  entry. For example, the CBP's apprehension data indicates the number of \n14  deportable migrants apprehended in the San Diego sector fell from 483,815 in 1996 \n15  (the year Section 102 ofIIRIRA was enacted) to 31,891 in 2016, a reduction of \n16  over 93%. (Ex,~' pp. 1, 17; Ex. 22, pp. 12-15 and appendix G.) Between 2013 and \n17  2015, the San Diego sector represented just 7% of the total number of \n18  apprehensions along the southwest border, far less than sectors in other states. (Ex. \n19  1, pp. 46-49.) The decline in El Centro sector apprehensions has been even more \n20  dramatic, with a reduction of nearly 92% from 2000 to 2016. (Ex. 2, pp. 1, 17.) \n21  Moreover, El Centro sector apprehensions accounted for just 4% of the total \n22  number across the entire southwest border between 2013 and 2015. (Ex. 1, pp. 46-\n23  49.) \n24  Thus, the San Diego and El Centro sectors are not sectors of high illegal entry \n25  regardless of whether that term is measured using historical standards or by \n26  comparing the current rates of illegal entry across all southwest border sectors. \n27  Because Section 102 only authorizes the installation of barriers in areas of high \n28 \n18 \nCalifornia Pis.'

(l 7cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.755   Page 30 of 51\n1  illegal entry, DHS cannot establish that its San Diego and Calexico Projects satisfy \n2  this requirement. Accordingly, the projects are not authorized by Section 102. \n3  B.  Section 102 Permits Only the Installation of \n\"Additional\" Barriers and Roads, Not the \n4  Replacement of Existing Fences \n5  Section 102 repeatedly uses the word \"additional\" to describe the types of barriers \n6  and roads authorized by the statute. At the outset, Section 102(a) provides: \n7  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such actions as may be \nnecessary to mstall additional physical barriers and roads (includmg the \n8  removal of obstacles to the detect10n of illegal entrants) in the vicimty of \nthe United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal \n9  entry into the United States. ( emphasis added) \n10  8 U.S.C. § l 103(a) note. Section 102(b)(l) uses the phrase \"additional fencing \n11  along southwest border\" to describe the 700 miles of fencing, including 370 miles \n12  of expedited fencing in priority areas, that the Secretary must construct by no later \n13  than December 31, 2008. Id.  § 1103(b) (1) note. And Section 102(b) (3) uses the \n14  term again in directing DHS to incorporate safety features. Id.  § l 103(b)(l) note \n15  (requiring safety features \"while constructing the additional fencing\"). \n16  Congress' repeated use of the word \"additional\" makes sense given the \n17  evolution of border infrastructure along the southwest border and the evolution of \n18  Section 102: with each new iteration of Section 102, Congress sought to install \n19  fencing in areas where none existed at the time. When Section 102 was originally \n20  enacted, Congress sought to add new layers of fencing to supplement the existing \n21  primary fence in San Diego. Pub. L. 104-208, div. C, title I,§ 102(a) to (c), 110 \n22  Stat. 3009-554 (Sept. 30, 1996). When amending Section 102 in 2006, Congress \n23  sought to add at least 800 miles of double layered fencing along the border. Pub. L. \n24  109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26; 2006). Finally, in amending the statute for \n25  the last time, Congress imposed a December 31, 2008, deadline for adding \n26  hundreds of more miles of fencing in priority areas on an expedited schedule. Pub. \n27  L. 110-161, div. E, tit. V, § 564(a), 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007). \n28  This \"context,\" which courts consider in determininga statute's meaning, \n19 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Swnm. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.756   Page 31 of 51\n1  makes clear that Congress intended Section 102 to permit only the installation of \n2  additional fencing, meaning fencing where none existed. McNeill v.  United States, \n3  563 U.S. 816, 819 (2011). That reading is consistent with the ordinary meaning of \n4  the term \"additional,\" which is defined as: existing or coming by way of addition: \n5  added, further. Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Copyright 2002. \n6  Notably, this is exactly how Section 102 was interpreted in the five waivers \n7  initiated by former Secretary Chertoff between September 2005 and April 2008. \n8  Each waiver identified projects that proposed the construction of additional fencing \n9  in areas where none existed at the time. None of the waivers were initiated for the \n10  purpose of replacing, repairing, or enhancing existing barriers. See Exs. 13-17. \n11  Unlike the previous waivers and contrary to the express terms of Section 102, \n12  the 2017 Waivers do not provide for installation of \"additional\" barriers or fences. \n13  Instead, the 2017 Waivers purport to authorize the replacement of existing fencing. \n14  Neither the San Diego or Calexico Projects would result in more miles of fencing \n15  along the southwest border. Because Section 102 only allows for the installation of \n16  additional fencing, the Secretary and DHS acted beyond the statutory authority \n17  granted by Section 102 in commencing construction of the Border Wall Projects. \n18  C.  Defendants Exceeded Their Statutory Authority by \nConstructing Fencing in Areas Where the Barriers \n19  Would Not Be \"Most Practical or Effective\" \n20  In 2008, Section 102 was amended to specify the amount and location of \n21  fencing permitted under Section 102(a). 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a) note. The 2008 \n22  Amendment gave the Secretary more discretion concerning the location of \n23  additional fencing, but required that the fencing be constructed in areas where it \n24  would be \"most practical and effective.\"12 \n25 \n12 The clause \"most practical and effective\" is used twice within Section \n26  102(b). 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(l){A) note; Id.  § l 103(b){l)(B) note. In light of the \ncontext in which 1t is used and the stated \"purpose of carrying out suosection (a),\" \n27  the phrase \"most practical and effective\" must be interpreted as applying to areas \nwhere additional fencing would be most the effective in deterring illegal entries. \n28 \n20 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. ln Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.757   Page 32 of 51\n1  DHS officials admit that the San Diego and Calexico Project Areas are not \n2  areas where additional infrastructure would be most practical or effective in \n3  deterring illegal entries. Former Secretary Kelly has opined that existing fences are \n4  \"extremely effective\" in reducing illegal entries, and DHS concedes that these \n5  sectors have the lowest priority for infrastructure projects. (Kelly TV Interview, \n6  2:10-2:27; Ex. 9, p. 15.) DHS also acknowledges it does not have any high priority \n7  infrastructure needs in either the San Diego or El Centro sectors. Id. Thus, DHS and \n8  the Secretary have clearly acted beyond their statutory authority. \n9  D.  Because Defendants Lack Authority to Build the \nBorder Wall Projects, the 2017 WaIVers Are Invalid \n10 \n11  Because DHS and the Secretary lack authority to construct the Border Wall \n12  Projects under either Section 102( a) or (b ), they als·o lack authority to waive laws to \n13  expedite that construction under Section 102( c ). Section 102(c ) provides that: \n14  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall have the \nauthority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, m such \n15  Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious \nconstruction of the barriers and roads under this section. \n16 \n17  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(l) note (emphasis added). As Defendants themselves concede, \n18  the phrase \"this section\" unambiguously refers to Section 102. (Case No. 3: 17-cv-\n19  01215-GPC-WVG, Doc. 18-1, p 17.) Accordingly, the phrase \"under this section\" \n20  limits the Secretary's waiver authority to construction authorized by Section 102. \n21  See Setser v.  United States, 566 U.S. 231,239 (2012) (courts should give effect \"to \n22  every clause and word of an Act\"). Because construction of the Border Wall \n23  Projects is not authorized by Section I 02 for the reasons explained above, the 2017 \n24  Waivers likewise are invalid. \n25  IV.  THE 2017 WAIVERS ARE INVALID BECAUSE THEWA  IVER AUTHORITY \nEXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2008 (FOURTH CLAIM) \n26 \n27  Alternatively, even assuming Section 102 authorizes construction of the \n28  Border Wall Projects, the 2017 Waivers are invalid because the authority to issue \n21 \nCalifornia Pis.'

To hold otherwise would violate the well-established rule that, \n2  \"[w   ]hen Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to \n3  have real and substantial effect.\" Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386,397 (1995). \n4  In its 2008 Amendment to Section 102, Congress changed the statute to \n5  require the Secretary to \"construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles \n6  of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical.\" Pub. L. 110-161, \n7  div. E, tit. V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007). Under the heading \"PRIORITY \n8  AREAS,\" Congress also required the Secretary, \"in carrying out this section,\" to \n9  identify 3 70 miles \"where fencing would be most practical and effective in \n10  deterring smugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the United \n11  States.\" Id.  Significantly, the 2008 Amendment provided that the authority to \n12  determine any \"other mileage\" for priority area fencing \"shall expire on December \n13  31, 2008.\" Id. The 2008 Amendment also imposed a deadline of December 31, \n14  2008, for the expedited construction of fencing in priority areas. Id. \n15  Recognizing the mandate to complete expedited fencing projects by the end of \n16  the year, former Secretary Chertoff in 2008 identified more than 37 0 miles of \n17  priority areas for expedited construction, issued waivers for this expedited \n18  construction, and committed DHS to a total of 661 miles of border fencing by the \n19  first half of 2009. (Ex. 5, pp. 2 (unnumbered), 8-9.) By April of 2013, DHS \n20  reported that it had completed all but a one-mile stretch of these projects, which \n21  ultimately involved 705 miles of fencing.

Nor could an unlimited waiver authority \n4  be squared with the plain language of Section 102 's waiver provision, which \n5  provides that a waiver may be used only when \"necessary to ensure expeditious \n6  construction of the barriers and roads under this section.\" 8 U.S.C. § l 103(c)(l) \n7  note. Defendants' position to the contrary would render impermissibly superfluous \n8  the limitations Congress placed on the Secretary's authority to identify priority \n9  areas and to complete construction by the end of 2008. See Duncan v.  Walker, 533 \n10  U.S. 167, 174 (2001). Accordingly, because the waiver authority has already \n11  expired, the 2017 Waivers exceeded the Secretary's authority and are therefore \n12  invalid. \n13  V.  DEFENDANTS EXCEEDED THEIR STATUTORY AUTHORITY IN ISSUING \nTHE 2017 WAIVERS BY MAKING No FINDINGS (FIFTH CLAIM) \n14 \n15  Alternatively, even if Section 102 authorizes the Border Wall Projects and the \n16  deadline to expedite construction has yet to expire, the 2017 Waivers are invalid \n17  because the Secretary failed to make the requisite findings to show that the projects \n18  comply with the requirements of Section 102. In issuing the 2017 Waivers, the \n19  Secretary must do more than \"paraphrase the statutory language.\" Gonzales v. \n20  Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 257 (2006). Where, as here, an agency alters the application \n21  of existing laws, it must give \"good reasons\" for doing so. Organized Village of \n22  Kake v.

Section 102(a) requires \n27  that projects be \"necessary,\" limited to \"additional physical barriers and roads,\" and \n28  in \"areas of high illegal entry.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a) note. Section 102(b) requires the \n23 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.

And Section 102(c) requires the Secretary to determine that \n3  waiving certain legal requirements is \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction \n4  of the barriers and roads.\" Id.§ l 103(c)(l) note. These findings are necessary so \n5  that a court can assess whether the Secretary selected qualifying projects and issued \n6  a valid waiver. \n7  Here, the Secretary has provided insufficient findings to justify the 2017 \n8  Waivers. Using boiler plate language copied from the statute, the 2017 Waivers \n9  claim that there is an \"immediate need to construct border barriers and roads\" in the \n10  San Diego and Calexico Project Areas because they are \"areas of high illegal \n11  entry.\" (Exs. 11, 12.) Such findings are inadequate because an agency that \"merely \n12  parrots the language of a statute without providing an account of how it reached its \ny. \n13  results ... has not adequately explained the basis for its decision.\" Dickson v. Se.c \n14  ofD  ef, 68 F.3d 1396, 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (rejecting agency's waiver decision). \n15  The 2017 Waivers also fail to support their conclusory statements that replacement \n16  of fencing will \"deter and prevent illegal crossings.\" (Exs. 11, 12.) And the Waivers \n17  do not even contend that the Border Wall Project Areas are where fencing would be \n18  \"most practical and effective,\" as required by Section 102(b ). Because the 2017 \n19  Waivers' boiler plate statements offer no good reasons for stripping Californians of \n20  their legal rights, the 2017 Waivers are invalid. \n21  VI.  THE 2017 WAIVERS INTERFERE WITH CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL \nSOVEREIGNTY AND POLICE POWERS IN VIOLATION OF THE TENTH \n22 \nAMENDMENT'S FEDERALISM PRINCIPLES (ELEVENTH CLAIM) \n23  The Tenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution states that \"[t]he powers not \n24  delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, \n25  are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The Supreme Court has \n26  interpreted this amendment to protect states and their people from federal \n27  overreach, including a federal law that burdens some geographic regions but not \n28  others or invades realms traditionally reserved to the states absent a showing that it \n24 \nCalifornia Pis.'

Holder, \n2  133 S. Ct. 2612, 2622 (2013) (citation omitted). The Court has recognized that a \n3  federal statute violates the Tenth Amendment as over-inclusive in either of two \n4  ways. First, a validly enacted federal statute that burdens a subset of states but not \n5  others will become unconstitutional if progress is made curbing the problem the \n6  statute seeks to prevent. Id. at 2628-29. Second, a federal statute that interferes with \n7  states' traditional police powers by enabling the nullification of laws which do not \n8  impede the statute's object is a disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional \n9  means to an end. City ofB  oerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 534-535 (1997). Because \n10  Section 102( c) suffers from both these constitutional infirmities, it cannot validly \n11  strip California and its people of their legal protections. \n12  The Supreme Court recently curbed the same type of federal overreach on \n13  display here. In Shelby County, the Court struck down a federal statute authorizing \n14  the Executive Branch to suspend certain election laws in several California counties \n15  and nine states because imposing such a burden on some geographic regions and \n16  not others violated the '\"fundamental principle of equal sovereignty\" among the \n17  states.

The Court acknowledged that, in bardng literacy tests and other \n19  racially-motivated forms of vote suppression, the federal law at issue-Section 4(b) \n20  of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\")-was constitutionally enacted pursuant to the \n21  Fifteenth Amendment and Article I, which affords Congress \"significant control \n22  over federal elections.\"Jd. at 2623, 2629. \n23  Nonetheless, the Court held that Section 4(b) had become unconstitutional in \n24  recent years because, by 2013, its disparate treatment of covered and non-covered \n25  states no longer could be justified by \"current needs,\" making it \"irrational.\" Id.  at \n26  2630-31. The Court found that the VRA had reduced the disparity between \n27  African-American and white voter turnout in those regions. Id. At the same time, \n28  the Executive Branch had curtailed its exercise of the VRA-created power to \n25 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.

Id.  at 2626. Because some states and local areas had \n3  shown signs of progress, the Court held that the VRA's \"disparate treatment of the \n4  States\" was unconstitutional as to all of them. Id. \n' \n5  Here, changed circumstances-dramatic reductions across the entire southwest \n6  border and even steeper declines in illegal border crossings within the specific \n7  project areas selected by DHS-have similarly rendered Section 102 \n8  unconstitutional. As in Shelby County, the success of earlier federal action has \n9  eliminated the justification for continuing to subject some states and not others to \n10  federal interference, such as the waiver of existing California law and the waiver of \n11  California's rights under federal law. In the two decades following the 1996 \n12  passage of Section 102, illegal border crossings dropped by over 93% in the San \n13  Diego Sector (Ex. 2, pp. 1, 17; Ex. 22, pp. 12-15; Appendix G) and 92% in the El \n14  Centro Sector over the past 16 years. Moreover, illegal crossings along the entire \n15  .  Southwest border have fallen 75% since their peak. (Ex. 2; pp l, 17; Ex. 8, p. 19.) \n16  In addition, in the last eight years, illegal border crossings in the San Diego Project \n17  Area have declined by 75% (Ex. 2). Texas and Arizona now account for 92% of the \n18  relatively few illegal crossings that continue. (Ex. 1, pp. 45-46; Ex. 2, p. 17; Ex. 20, \n19  p. 20). \n20  This progress \"cannot be ignored\" and confirms that continued federal \n21  interference in state police powers and state sovereignty is no longer justified. \n22  Shelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2628. Because some regions, such as the project areas \n23  within California, no longer suffer from the once widespread problem that Congress \n24  sought to combat, the \"substantial federalism costs\" that Section 102(c ) imposes are \n25  no longer justified. Id. at 2622. Much like in Shelby, the disparate treatment of \n26  California, which has been targeted for the waiver of state laws even though the \n27  California sectors are no longer experiencing larger numbers of illegal entries, \n28  renders the entire statute unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment. \n26 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.763   Page 38 of 51\n1  Moreover, the sweeping waiver provision in Section 102( c) is far broader and \n2  interferes far more with state sovereignty than any statute before it. According to \n3  the DHS, Section 102( c) permits the Executive Branch to indefinitely waive all \n4  state and local laws and regulations, requires no factual findings to justify it, and \n5  deprives a litigant of any forum to challenge whether the statute's requirements \n6  were even met. In contrast, the section of the VRA struck down by the Supreme \n7  Court permitted the Executive Branch to suspend only \"a discrete class\" of state \n8  laws, and allowed any covered region to exempt itself from federal oversight \n9  simply by showing in court that the harm the VRA sought to prevent had not \n10  occurred in \"the preceding five years.\" City ofB  oerne, 521 U.S. at 533-535 \n11  ( citation omitted). \n12  Alternatively, Section 102( c) is unconstitutional because it is a \"considerable \n13  congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general \n14  authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.\" City ofB  oerne, \n·15  521 U.S. at 534. It is well-established that the federal government \"possesses only \n16  limited powers,\" whereas the Tenth Amendment ensures that \"the States and the \n17  people retain the remainder.\" Bond v.  United States, 134 S. Ct. 2077, 2086 (2014).; \n18  U.S. Const., amend. X. And even where Congress acts pursuant to those limited \n19  powers, it may still run afoul of federalism principles-as in Shelby County, where \n20  the Court struck down the VRA. U.S. Const. art. I, Section 4, cl. 1; Shelby Cty., 133 \n21  S. Ct. at 2623. \"States have broad authority to enact legislation for the public \n22  good-what we have often called a 'police power.\"' Bond, 134 S. Ct. at 2086. \n23  Applying these principles, the Supreme Court has refused to enforce federal laws \n24  that, like Section 102( c ), curtail states' \"great latitude under their police powers to \n25  legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all \n26  persons.\" Gonzales v.  Oregon, 546 U.S. 243,270 (2006). The Court also \n27  recognized that a federal law is unconstitutional where it so interferes with states' \n28  traditional police powers as to be \"out of proportion\" to its object. City ofB  oerne, \n27 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mern. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.764   Page 39 of 51\n1  521 U.S. at 533-536 (act which provided broad powers to nullify state laws not \n2  justifiable based on current needs, as the legislative history contained only old or \n3  \"anecdotal evidence\" of the harm Congress sought to curtail). \n4  Section 102( c) reflects an even more disproportionate response to a \n5  nonexistent need. Like the act at issue in City ofB  oerne, Section 102( c) is grossly \n6  overbroad; its \"sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of \n7  government\" and purports to allow the waiver of \"all federal and state law.\" Id. at \n8  532. Such federal overreach is disproportionate because it endangers laws that do \n9  not work the evil Congress sought to combat, such as California's work place \n10  safety, contract, and anti-graft laws. Further, forcing states to \"beseech the Federal \n11  Government for permission to implement laws\" they otherwise could enforce in \n12  their own courts is an unconstitutional intrusion into state sovereignty. Shelby Cty., \n13  133 S. Ct. at 2624. Because this \"federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state and \n14  local policymaking\" is an \"extraordinary departure from the traditional course of \n15  relations between the States and the Federal Government,\" Section 102(c ) must fail. \n16  Id.  at 2624 ( citation omitted). \n17  VII. SECTION 102( c)'s PROCEDURAL HURDLES AND THE VAGUE 2017 \nWAIVERS VIOLATE CALIFORNIA'S ARTICLE III AND DUE PROCESS \n18 \nRIGHTS (SIXTH CLAIM) \n19  DHS's vague 2017 Waivers and Section 102(c)'s unreasonable procedural \n20  hurdles are an impermissible assault on Californians' Article III and due process \n21  rights and the rights of potential parties to petition the Court. \"A fundamental \n22  principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or entities must \n23  give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.\" FCC v. Fox Television \n24  Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012). The 2017 Waivers violate that principle by \n25  failing to identify the state laws that are purportedly waived. For example, the 2017 \n26  Waivers purport not only to waive the 37 federal laws identified in the waivers but \n27  also \"all ... state, or other laws, regulations and legal requirements of, deriving \n28  from, or related to the subject of' those federal statutes. California and its citizens \n28 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.765   Page 40 of 51\n1  are placed in the position of having to guess which state laws have been waived \n2  and, thus, unable to determine the scope of conduct that remains the subject of its \n3  own laws. \n4  Moreover, the San Diego Waiver is hopelessly vague when it states that DHS \n5  intends to install \"various border infrastructure projects\" within the \"Project Area,\" \n6  a 15-mile segment of the border. (Ex. 11.) While the San Diego Waiver identifies \n7  two examples of infrastructure projects DHS intends to build (prototypes and the \n8  replacement of the primary fence), it fails to describe the other \"various border \n9  infrastructure projects\" that DHS may elect to build sometime in the future. The \n10  San Diego Waiver, therefore: (1) does not provide sufficient information to \n11  determine whether the undisclosed projects are authorized by Section 102; (2) gives \n12  no notice to property owners that their land may be burdened by the waiver; and, \n13  (3) leaves open the possibility that DHS may attempt to build additional projects \n14  not authorized by Section 102. \n15  In addition, the San Diego Waiver fails to provide reasonable notice of when \n16  any of these undisclosed projects will be constructed and purports to waive federal \n17  and state laws for the on-going maintenance of those structures. This means DHS \n18  may attempt to build a solid wall, or some other undisclosed structure, five or ten \n19  years from now and claim the San Diego Waiver still applies, or may even assert \n20  that the San Diego Waiver applies in perpetuity. The San Diego Waiver also fails to \n21  specify how far the project area will extend in a northerly direction, leaving open \n22  the possibility these undisclosed projects will lead to the condemnation of \n23  additional state-owned or private property. \n24  These uncertainties leave California and its citizens in legal limbo - unable to \n25  determine whether the various infrastructure projects will be the types of projects \n26  authorized under Section 102, whether the area will be considered an area of high \n27  illegal entry at the time it is installed, and whether they should file a claim to \n28  protect their individual rights. \n29 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Swnm. J.

The Supreme Court has recognized that \"all statutes of limitation must proceed \n5  on the idea that the party has full opportunity afforded him to try his right in the \n6  courts.\" Wilson v. lseminger, 185 U.S. 55, 62-63 (1902). Here, Section 102's 60-\n7  day limitations period is \"manifestly unjust\" because, when combined with the \n8  2017 Waivers' lack of clarity, it deprives a litigant \"of a forum without giving ... \n9  adequate notice to protect its otherwise valid rights.\" Hartford Cas. Ins.  Co. v. \n10  FDIC, 21 FJd 696, 701-04 (5th Cir. 1994). In effect, the 60-day limitations period \n11  and the vague nature of the 2017 Waivers are being used to strip California and \n12  other litigants of their rights afforded under Section 102( c) and Article III of the \n13  United States Constitution. \n14  In addition, by barring all non-constitutional claims from being heard in any \n15  forum, Section 102( c )(2)(A) unconstitutionally interferes with the \"right of access \n16  to the courts\"-one of the \"most precious\" liberties safeguarded by the First \n17  Amendment. BE & K Const. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 524-525 (2002); U.S. \n18  Const. amend. I; see also, Commodity Futures Trading Comm. v. Schor, 478 U.S. \n19  833, 848 (1986). A statute like Section 102 that imposes burdens to discourage \n20  litigants from challenging its \"validity or enforcement,\" is especially suspect. See, \n21  In re Workers' Compensation Refimd, 46 F.3d 813, 821-22 (8th Cir. 1995). \n22  Accordingly, Section 102's procedural hurdle·s, combined with the 2017 Waivers' \n23  vagueness, amount to \"an unlawful attempt to extinguish rights arbitrarily.\" Wilson, \n24  185 U.S. at 62-63. \n25  VIII.  THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS \nDOCTRINE (SEVENTH CLAIM) \n26 \n27  The Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed \"the central judgment of the \n28  Framers of the Constitution that, within our political scheme, the separation of \n30 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.767   Page 42 of 51\n1  governmental powers into three coordinate Branches is essential to the preservation \n2  of liberty.\" Mistretta v.  United States, 488 U.S. 361, 380-384 (1989). The Court has \n3  also recognized that \"our constitutional system imposes upon the Branches a degree \n4  of overlapping responsibility, a duty of interdependence as well as independence \n5  · the absence of which 'would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of \n6  governing itself effectively.\"' Id. The key constitutional concern is whether actions \n7  or provisions of law \"either accrete to a single Branch powers more appropriately \n8  diffused among separate Branches or that undermine the authority and \n9  independence of one or another coordinate Branch.\" Id. \n10  The Constitution separates the power to make law from the power and duty to \n11  execute the law. Article I vests \"[a]ll legislative powers\" in the Congress. U.S. \n12  Const. art. I, section 1. The President's constitutional role is to \"take Care that the \n13  Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. Const. art. II, Section 3. This separation of \n14  legislative and executive power is a central foundation of our government. See, e.g., \n15  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.  v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952); Buckley v. \n16  Valeo, 424 U.S. l, 129 {1976); Chadha, 462 U.S. 919; Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. \n17  714 (1986). Therefore, Congress cannot vest its own legislative powers in the \n18  Executive Branch even if Congress intended such a result. Clinton v. New York, 524 \n19  U.S. 417, 444-447 (1988). As the Court explained in Youngstown Sheet & Tube \n20  Co., 343 U.S. at 587, \"the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully \n21  executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\" \n22  The Supreme Court has upheld statutes where Congress \"legislated in the \n23  contingency\" by providing the Executive Branch with specific laws that Congress \n24  has deemed appropriate to waive in certain contingent circumstances. For example, \n25  the Court rejected challenges under the separation of powers doctrine in cases such \n26  as Field v.  Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892) and J W.  Hampton, Jr.  & Co.  v.  United \n27  States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), where Congress performed thelegislative function of \n28  deciding which specific tariffs, or laws, could be modified or terminated and under \n31 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.768   Page 43 of 51\n1  what circumstances, and the President was \"the mere agent of the lawmaking \n2  department to ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to \n3  take effect.\" J. W Hampton, Jr.  & Co., 276 U.S. at 411. Another example is the \n4  original version of Section 102, where Congress allowed for the waiver of two \n5  specific acts of Congress, NEPA and the ESA, under certain circumstances, and \n6  where the laws were clearly spelled out.  In that case, the Executive Branch was \n7  merely provided with discretion on how to implement the waivers of two statutes \n8  that Congress had already chosen. Pub. L. 104-208, div. C, § 102(c). \n9  In stark contrast, the current version of Section 102 authorizes the DHS \n10  Secretary to pick and choose among enacted laws and determine, in his or her sole \n11  discretion, which pieces shall be waived. In enacting Section 102, \n12  Congress has not stated which laws are to be waived or why, and has instead given \n13  the Executive Branch that authority.  Section 102 was not \"legislated in the \n14  contingency\" as the Supreme Court allowed in the Field and J. W Hampton cases, \n15  and Congress had no idea which laws were going to be waived when it enacted the \n16  law, nor did the President when he signed the law. Congress has thus impermissibly \n17  granted the Executive Branch the essential legislative power of waiving existing \n18  law. Such a blanket waiver is investing legislative functions in the Executive \n19  Branch, a clear violation of the doctrine of the separation of powers. This waiver \n20  authority must therefore be declared unconstitutional and the 2017 Waivers must be \n21  invalidated. \n22  IX.  SECTION 102( C) AND THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE THE NON \nDELEGATION DOCTRINE (EIGHTH CLAIM) \n23 \n24  \"The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine is that the lawmaking \n25  function belongs to Congress ... and may not be conveyed to another branch or \n26  entity.\"  Lovingv. United States, 517U.S. 748,758 (1996) (citingFieldv. Clark, \n27  143 U.S. 649, 692 (1892)). \"The Congress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer \n28  to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested.\"  A.L.A. \n32 \nCalifornia Pis.'

United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 (1935). This doctrine \n2  stems from Article 1, Section I of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that \"[a]ll \n3  legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States \n4  \" \nA.  The Section 102(c) Waiver Provision Lacks a Sufficient \n5  Intelligible Principle \n6 \nCongress may delegate legislative power if it provides sufficient guidance for \n7 \nthe recipient of that delegation. \"[W]hen Congress confers decision making \n8 \nauthority upon agencies Congress must 'lay down by legislative act an intelligible \n9 \nprinciple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\"' \n10 \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Assocs., 53 l U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (quoting J W. \n11 \nHampton, Jr., & Co.  v.  United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). This \"intelligible \n12 \nprinciple\" limits the scope of the delegation and enables review of whether the \n13 \nagency has properly exercised the delegated authority to achieve Congress' \n14 \nobjective. Amalgamated lvleat Cutters and Butcher Workmen v.  Connally, 337 \n15 \nF.Supp. 737, 746 (D.D.C. 1971). It must be sufficiently definite to \"enable \n16 \nCongress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the [ recipient of delegated \n17 \nauthority] has conformed to those standards.\"  Yakus v.  United States, 321 U.S. \n18 \n414, 426 (1944). \n19 \nPrevious district courts have found an intelligible principle in Section 102(c  )'s \n20 \ninclusion of the words \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n21 \nand roads under this section.\"  E.g., Defenders of Wildlife v.  Chertojf, 527 F. Supp. \n22 \n2d 119, 128 (D.D.C. 2007); County ofE  l Paso v.  Chertojf, No. EP-08-CA-196-FM, \n23 \n2008 WL 4372693 (W.D. Tex. 2008). All four district courts to consider the \n24 \nquestion reasoned that the circumstances in which the waiver could be exercised \n25 \nwere narrow enough that it was an appropriate delegation of congressional \n26 \nauthority. Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128; County ofE  l Paso, 2008 \n27 \nWL 4372693; Save Our Heritage Organization v.  Gonzalez, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 \n28 \n33 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem.

Ashcroft, No. 04CV0272-LAB (JMA) (S.D. Cal. \n2  2005). As one court explained, \"the Secretary may only exercise the waiver \n3  authority for the 'narrow purpose' prescribed by Congress: 'expeditious \n4  completion' of the border fences authorized by Section 102 in areas of high illegal \n5  entry.\" Defenders of Wildlife v.  Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128. \n6  However, even if this guidance provided a sufficiently intelligible principle \n7  when Section 102( c) was enacted, it no longer serves that purpose today. The \n8  passage of time rendered the criteria of \"expeditious construction\" useless as an \n9  intelligible principle; the word \"expeditious\" is defined as \"marked by or acting \n10  with prompt efficiency.\"  Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2017. \n11  http://www.merriam-webster.com (Oct. 23, 2017). Applying the phrase \n12  \"expeditious construction\" to new border infrastructure projects, planned and built \n13  nearly a decade after the last amendment to Section 102, would strain that \n14  definition. \n15  B.  The Lack of Judicial Review Violates the Non \nDelegation Doctrine \n16 \n17  The availability of review-whether it be judicial review, administrative \n18  review, or congressional oversight-is critical to a proper delegation of \n19  congressional authority. \"The safeguarding of meaningful judicial review is one of \n20  the primary functions of the doctrine prohibiting undue delegation of legislative \n21  powers.\" Amalgamated Meat Cutters, 337 F. Supp. at 759. Judicial review ensures \n22  that the agency or official to which Congress has delegated power adheres to the \n23  intelligible principle Congress provided. \"The legislative policies and standards \n24  being clear, judicial review of the remedies adopted by the [agency] safeguards \n25  against statutory or constitutional excesses.\"  Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 \n26  U.S. 90, 106 (1946). Without an opportunity for meaningful review of whether an \n27  agency or official is acting within the scope of Congress' delegation of authority, \n28  the intelligible principle performs no function at all. \n34 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.771   Page 46 of 51\n1  In A.L.A. Schechter Poultry, the Court struck down the National Industrial \n2  Recovery Act. There, the Court expressed concern about the lack of review \n3  provided by the statute, explaining that the statute in question dispensed with the \n4  administrative procedures in place under the Federal Trade Commission Act \"and \n5  with any administrative procedure of an analogous character.\" A.L.A. Schechter \n6  Poultry, 295 U.S. at 533. The Court focused on the fact the National Industrial \n7  Recovery Act included no procedures at all for review of whether actions taken by \n8  the President came within the scope of Congress' delegated authority. Id. This lack \n9  of review, combined with the lack of an intelligible principle, resulted in the \n10  Court's decision to strike down the statute. \n11  Courts have on numerous occasions found that it was the review -judicial or \n12  otherwise-provided by the statute in question that saved the statute from a non-\n13  delegation challenge. See e.g. Touby v.  United States, 500 U.S. 160 (1991); \n14  Humphrey v. Baker, 848 F.2d 211 (D.D.C. 1988). Section 102(c)'s waiver \n15  provision, however, provides no meaningful opportunity for review of the \n16  Secretary's exercise of the waiver if the only challenges that can be brought are \n17   constitutional challenges and the Secretary is allowed to exercise congressional \n18  powers in his or her sole discretion and without regard to prerequisites set forth in \n19  the statute. Because there is no meaningful opportunity for review of whether the \n20  Secretary's invocation of the waiver authority adheres to any intelligible principle, \n21  Section 102( c) violates the non-delegation doctrine. \n22  X.  SECTION 102(C) AND THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE ARTICLE I, SECTION \n3, OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (NINTH CLAIM) \n23 \n24  Article I, Section 3 of the United States Constitution states in regard to \n25  impeachment that \"the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n26  Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\" The Supreme \n27  Court has stated on numerous occasions that this means the Constitution does not \n28  provide immunity to criminal laws or criminal prosecution. 0 'Shea v. Littleton, 414 \n35 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.772   Page 47 of 51\n1  U.S. 488, 503-504 (1974); Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 31-32 (1980). The Court \n2  has repeatedly drawn distinctions between officials' powers to overcome civil law \n3  and powers to overcome criminal law. In Dennis v. Sparks, the Supreme Court held \n4  that a state judge could be held criminally liable for conspiracy involving bribery \n5  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, despite the judge being immune to civil liability under the \n6  same statute. Dennis, 449 U.S. at 27-29. In other words, no person is above the law. \n7  US. v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220 (1882). \n8  Further, Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the President \n9  \"shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United . \n10  States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\" This is the Executive Branch's check on \n11  the power of the other two branches when acting in the criminal law sphere. Ex \n12  Parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87, 119-120 (1925). But the President and the Executive \n13  Branch appointees are not immune from criminal prosecution and cannot simply \n14  ignore or unilaterally waive a criminal law of the United States. See United States v. \n15  Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 707-708 (1974); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 165-166 \n16  (1803). This is at the very heart of our Constitution. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 709; Berger \n17  v.  United States, 295 U.S. 78, 85-87 (1935). \n18  Here, the Secretary has waived numerous criminal laws concerning Border \n19  Wall Projects' c.onstruction. The Secretary, for example, has waived the Resource \n20  Conservation Recovery Act provision (42 U.S.C. § 6928) making it a crime to \n21  knowingly dump hazardous waste that puts another person in imminent danger of \n22  death or serious bodily injury. The Secretary has also waived a law making it a \n23  crime to knowingly pollute a river, stream or other water of the United States in a \n24  way that places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm \n25  in contravention of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c). Congress \n26  cannot provide the President or the Executive Branch with such sweeping powers to \n27  waive federal criminal laws in its sole discretion, without even listing which \n28  criminal laws can be waived. This is contrary to our legal system and puts the \n36 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Swnm. J.  (l 7cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.773   Page 48 of 51\n1  Executive Branch above the law of the United States. \n2  In addition, the Supreme Court has not resolved the question of whether more \n3  specific guidance from Congress is required than the ordinary \"intelligible \n4  principle\" where the delegation of legislative powers to the Executive Branch \n5  pertains to criminal law or criminal sanctions.  Touby v.  United States, 500 U.S. \n6  160, 165-66 (1991) (\"Our cases are not entirely clear as to whether more specific \n7  guidance is in fact required.\") Here, however, Section 102, if it even provides the \n8  necessary guidance required by the \"intelligible principle,\" certainly does not \n9  provide any further guidance that may be required for acting in the criminal sphere. \n10  In fact, Section 102 allows the Executive Branch to immunize itself and its \n11  contractors from any criminal law it deems necessary in its sole discretion. \n12  Congress does not even name the criminal laws that can be waived. Therefore, \n13  Section 102 has not met the heightened standard required of delegating in the \n14  criminal sphere and has allowed the Executive Branch to put itself above the law. \n15  Section 102 's waiver authority must therefore be declared unconstitutional and the \n16  2017 Waivers should be declared invalid. \n17  XI.  SECTION 102(C) AND THE 2017 WAIVERS VIOLATE THE PRESENTMENT \nCLAUSE (ART. l, SECTION 7) (TENTH CLAIM) \n18 \n19  The Presentment Clause provides that\"[ e ]very Bill which shall have passed \n20  the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be \n21  presented to the President of the United States; if he approves he shall sign it, but if \n22  not he shall return it.\"  U.S. Const. art. I, Section 7, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has \n23  interpreted these procedural requirements to apply to both the enactment and repeal \n24  of statutes. INS v.  Chadha, 462 U.S. 919,954 (1983). \n25  Section 102( c) suffers from the same constitutional weaknesses as the Line \n26  Item Veto Act at issue in Clinton v.  City ofN  ew York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998). There, \n27  the Supreme Court struck down the line item veto under the Presentment Clause \n28  because the act, in legal and practical effect, allowed the President to partially \n37 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cv1215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.774   Page 49 of 51\n1  repeal laws, depriving the vetoed provisions of legal force and effect. Id. at 438. In \n2  arriving at this conclusion, the Court distinguished the Line Item Veto Act from the \n3  Tariff Act it upheld in Field v.  Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892). The Court identified \n4  three critical differences between the two acts that demonstrated the \n5  unconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 443. First, \n6  exercise of the line item veto was contingent on conditions that existed when \n7  Congress passed the laws the President partially vetoed, whereas suspension of \n8  import duty exemptions in Field was contingent on conditions that did not exist \n9  when Congress passed the Tariff Act issuing those exemptions. Id.  Second, in \n10  Clinton, after making congressionally prescribed determinations, the Executive \n11  retained unbridled discretion regarding whether to veto spending measures. Id.  at \n12  443-44. And third, in issuing a line item veto, the President was acting contrary to \n13  congressional intent. Id.  at 444. The Line Item Veto Act, therefore, gave the \n14  President \"unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes\" in violation \n15  of the Presentment Clause. Id.  at 44 7. \n16  Here, Section 102( c) grants the Secretary nearly unbridled discretion in \n17  determining which laws to waive, under what time line, and the scope of activities \n18  covered by the waiver. Unlike Field, in which the President had a duty to act in \n19  congressionally defined ways after determining a threshold condition had been met, \n20  here the Secretary has unchecked authority to waive any laws for an indefinite time \n21  period once he or she determines it necessary for expeditious border security. In \n22  fact, the Secretary's discretion to waive any laws is broader in some ways than that \n23  of the President to exercise the line item veto in Clinton. There, the President could \n24  exercise the line item veto only with respect to spending measures and Congress \n25  retained the power to reject the line item veto. Clinton,  524 U.S. at 436. Here, the \n26  Secretary has authority to waive any law regardless of subject matter, including \n27  laws far outside the Secretary's homeland security expertise, and Congress has \n28  retained no authority to reject the waivers. \n38 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. ln Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (17cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.775   Page 50 of 51\n1  Further, much like the Line Item Veto Act at issue in Clinton, the waiver \n2  provision allows the Executive to act contrary to the intent of Congress by waiving \n3  laws passed by Congress and intended to apply to activities in the relevant region. \n4  By remaining silent as to which laws the Secretary could waive, Congress provides \n5  no guidance as to its intent regarding which laws the Secretary should waive. Did \n6  Congress intend for the Secretary to waive bribery and racketeering laws, or the \n7  prohibition on the intentional disposal of hazardous waste? Section 102( c) grants \n8  such broad discretion to the Secretary regarding which, if any, laws to waive that \n9  the Secretary's actions only can be said to be implementing the Executive's will, \n10  not that of Congress. Also, as in Clinton, the fact that that Congress intended to \n11  allow waivers when it passed Section 102(c ) is of no import if the waiver provision \n12  is unconstitutional. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 445-46. \n13  The existence and use of waiver provisions in other laws does not force an \n14  alternative conclusion, contrary to the court's view in Defenders of Wildlife v. \n15  Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 125 (D.D.C. 2007). Other waiver provisions have \n16  limited Executive discretion by allowing waiver of a provision within the same act \n17  or a limited category of laws, or by mandating specified waiver actions once the \n18  Executive determines a threshold event has occurred, and none has precluded \n19  judicial review. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. § 433 (limiting waivable laws to those specific \n20  laws regarding management of Federal agencies); 22 U.S.C. § 7207(a)(3) (allowing \n21  waiver of restrictions on aid to specified countries for specific reasons). In contrast, \n22  the waiver provision in Section 102(c) grants the Secretary unbridled discretion to \n23  waive any and all laws for an indefinite time and for undefined activities, and \n24  provides for limited judicial review. This waiver, more than those in other statutes, \n25  purports to allow the Secretary to unilaterally change statutes. \n26  Further, no court to address Section 102( c) has dealt with such a broad \n27  application of the waiver provision. See, e.g., Defenders, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119; Save \n28  Our Heritage Organization v.  Gonzalez, 533 F. Supp. 2d. 58 (D.D.C. 2008). By \n39 \nCalifornia Pis.' Mem. In Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J.  (l 7cvl215-GPC(WVG)) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 30-2   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.776   Page 51 of 51\n1  expanding the use of the waiver provision, the 2017 Waivers demonstrate more \n2  clearly than the previous waivers the similarity between Section 102( c) and the \n3  Line Item Veto Act that the Court held unconstitutional in Clinton. The Secretary \n4  has used nearly unbridled discretion to effectively repeal dozens of laws - robbing \n5  them of legal force and effect for an indefinite time period and for as yet undefined \n6  activities in the region. Therefore, the Secretary's application of Section 102(c ) in \n7  the 2017 Waivers violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution. \n8  CONCLUSION \n9  Defendants' ill-defined and ill-considered project to construct a massive \n10  border wall and related barriers along our international border with Mexico is \n11  beginning to lunge forward in virtually secret-until-the-last-minute steps. This \n12  piecemeal activity is occurring without the comprehensive and reasoned public \n13  review and mitigation of the adverse environmental impacts of Defendants' \n14  proposed multibillion dollar development that is envisioned by fundamental federal \n15  statutes such as NEPA and the CZMA. This unlawful conduct cannot be justified \n16  by the outdated and inapplicable waiver provisions of Section 102 and is wholly \n17  inconsistent with the constitutional safeguards discussed above. Accordingly, the \n18  People of the State of California and the California Coastal Commission \n19  respectfully request the Court to enter summary judgment in favor of their claims. \n20  Dated:  November 22, 2017  Respectfully Submitted, \n21 \nXAVIER BECERRA \nAttorney General of California \n22  TIMOTHY R.

Thus, Plaintiffs’ goal in these \n8  consolidated cases is to force the narrowest possible reading of this statute and to \n9  thwart the construction of border infrastructure.  The Court should reject their various \n10  attempts to neuter § 102 and overturn Congress’s exercise of legislative judgment. \n11  First, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has shown that Congress \n12  withdrew this Court’s jurisdiction to consider non-constitutional claims “arising from \n13  any action undertaken, or any decision made” pursuant to § 102’s waiver authority.  \n14  IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A).  This bars not only Plaintiffs’ claims under the environmental \n15  statutes, but also Plaintiffs’ efforts to press “arbitrary and capricious” challenges under \n16  the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for aspects of the waiver determinations.  \n17  It also is one of the exceptional circumstances in which Congress has barred review of \n18  whether the agency action was within the scope of statutory authority.  While courts \n19  generally presume that Congress intends to permit such ultra vires review, here the \n20  statutory text, context, and legislative history demand the conclusion that Congress \n21  did not want agency action delayed by such legal challenges.  Accordingly, it is for \n22  Congress to police DHS’s exercise of this delegated authority, not the courts. \n23  Second, even if ultra vires review were available—and it is not—the waiver \n24  determinations must be upheld.  Plaintiffs have fallen far short of their heavy burden \n25  to establish that DHS has violated a clear statutory mandate or prohibition.  Their lead \n26  argument—that the only construction authority is found in § 102(b) and § 102(a) \n27  confers no additional authority—was specifically rejected by another court and is not \n28 \n  1 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1379   Page 14 of 49\n \n1  the most plausible reading of the statutory text and Congress’s intent.  More \n2  egregiously, Plaintiffs attempt to turn deadlines set by Congress in 2007 to ensure \n3  swift completion of certain projects into a provision causing the expiration of all § 102 \n4  authority.  This distortion cannot be reconciled with the text or Congress’s intent.  Nor \n5  have Plaintiffs established that any of the phrases they pluck from the statute \n6  constitute clear mandates or prohibitions that DHS has violated.  The Court should \n7  decline Plaintiffs’ invitation to convert the extraordinarily limited ultra vires inquiry \n8  into ordinary APA review. \n9  Third, Plaintiffs have not established that any of the constitutional provisions on \n10  which they rely prohibit Congress from delegating authority to waive other laws or \n11  limiting judicial review of such waiver determinations.  Many of Plaintiffs’ claims \n12  have been repeatedly rejected by courts considering § 102, and the others are novel \n13  applications of constitutional doctrine that can be quickly rejected.  None raise \n14  questions serious enough to justify application of the canon of constitutional \n15  avoidance in construing § 102’s plain text. \n16   Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, and Plaintiffs’ \n17  motions for summary judgment should be denied. \n18  ARGUMENT \n19  I.  CALIFORNIA HAS NOT CARRIED ITS BURDEN TO ESTABLISH \nSTANDING \n20 \nCalifornia has abandoned its claimed injury to its tourism industry, which, as \n21 \nDHS explained is not traceable to the challenged agency actions.  See Defs.’ Br. at 9; \n22 \nCal. Reply at 1-3.  California also lacks standing to press claims regarding \n23 \ninfrastructure projects “along the entire 2000-mile southern border,” Cal. Reply at 3, \n24 \nother than those specified in the 2017 waiver determinations.  California has not \n25 \nestablished standing for projects outside its borders, nor has it established that any \n26 \nother projects within the state are sufficiently imminent to cause cognizable injury.  \n27 \nSee Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008); see infra, Arg. § V.  \n28 \n  2 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1380   Page 15 of 49\n \n1  As for its “sovereign interests,” California has not carried its burden to establish \n2  that the waivers impacted state laws which would actually have been enforceable in \n3  connection with these specific projects—other than state laws involving permitting \n4  pursuant to the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”).  See Cal. Compl. \n5  ¶¶ 38-39, 112-115 (claiming violation of state laws related to the CZMA).  Its reply \n6  brief merely string-cites eight portions of the state code or regulations without \n7  explaining how these requirements would apply to the challenged projects.1  \n8  Accordingly, California has failed to establish each of essential elements of standing.  \n9  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).2  Its string-cite does \n10  not pass muster for an issue that is Plaintiffs’ burden to establish.  See, e.g., Boyd v. \n11  United States, No. 15-3494, 2017 WL 1133512, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2017); \n12  Barnum Timber Co. v. EPA, No. 08-1988, 2008 WL 4447690, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. \n13 \n                                           \n14 \n1 The citations are far from self-evident.  California does not explain how its \n15  provisions allowing its Attorney General to bring or intervene in legal actions have \nbeen preempted.  See Cal. Gov. Code. §§ 12606, 12607.  Similarly, it does not \n16 \nestablish how the state definition of “public nuisance,” Cal. Civil Code § 3480, could \n17  be enforceable against a federal construction project on federal land.  Such state laws \nprovide no jurisdiction or enforcement power against the United States.  Moreover, \n18 \nCalifornia Public Resource Code § 40000 and California Health and Safety Code § \n19  25100 appear to implement provisions of two federal statutes—the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and \n20 \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”)—but it is not at all clear that the \n21  projects at issue here will involve hazardous waste and certainly do not involve \nSuperfund sites.  California cites generally to “Cal. Water Code § 13000 et seq.,” \n22 \nwhich appears to include provisions implementing the federal Clean Water Act, but \n23  does not explain what provisions could be relevant here.  And the only regulation it \ncites, 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 17380-17386, is an article that expressly does not apply \n24 \nto entities that “generate . . . debris . . . at the site of the construction work” or import \n25  debris to “be used in the construction work.”  See id. § 13780(g) (further explaining \nthat “public works agencies constructing roads . . . are not subject to these regulations \n26 \nduring the course of the construction work”). \n27 \n2 Hereinafter, internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations are omitted from \n28  quotations unless otherwise noted. \n  3 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1381   Page 16 of 49\n \n1  29, 2008).  Thus, California has failed to establish standing for any claim dependent \n2  on a showing that state laws other than those incident to the CZMA could be \n3  implicated by the projects but have been rendered unenforceable. \n4  II.  THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO CONSIDER PLAINTIFFS’ \nNON-CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS REGARDING THE WAIVER \n5  DECISIONS  \n6 \nDHS has established that Congress expressly withdrew jurisdiction for courts to \n7 \nconsider non-constitutional claims regarding the waiver determinations and \n8 \nconstruction conducted pursuant to those determinations.  See Defs.’ Br. at 10-23.  \n9 \nCongress crafted language designed to overcome the “strong presumption that \n10 \nCongress intends judicial review of administrative action,” Bowen v. Michigan Acad. \n11 \nof Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986).  As the Supreme Court has \n12 \nexplained, this presumption is merely an “interpretive guide” that is “dislodge[d]” \n13 \nwhen it is clear that Congress intended to preclude judicial review.  Kucana v. Holder, \n14 \n558 U.S. 233, 251 (2010); see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United States, 648 F.3d \n15 \n708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (stating that presumption of judicial review for administrative \n16 \naction “is overcome” when “Congress expressly bars review by statute”).  And \n17 \nCongress has overcome that presumption here by providing:   \n18 \nThe district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction \nto hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any \n19 \ndecision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n20 \nparagraph (1).  A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a \nviolation of the Constitution of the United States.  The court shall not \n21 \nhave jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.   \n22 \nIIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(c)(2)(A), 110 Stat. 3009-554 \n23 \n(Sept. 30, 1996), as amended (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note).  \n24 \nAs previously noted, this statutory language is emphatic and comprehensive.  It \n25 \nexpansively encompasses not only claims challenging “any [waiver] decision made” \n26 \nby the Secretary but also “any action undertaken” pursuant to that determination.  Id.  \n27 \nIt makes district court jurisdiction “exclusive,” id., thereby preempting any concurrent \n28 \n  4 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1382   Page 17 of 49\n \n1  state court jurisdiction.  And it narrows district court jurisdiction by expressly \n2  identifying the sort of suits that may be brought:  “only . . . alleging a violation of the \n3  Constitution,” and expressly removing jurisdiction over “any claim not specified in \n4  this subparagraph.”  Id.  As explained in the accompanying conference report, this \n5  provision was intended “to ensure that judicial review of actions or decisions of the \n6  Secretary not delay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure, \n7  thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary’s waiver.”  See Defs.’ Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. \n8  No. 109-72 at 172 (Conf. Rep.). \n9  Congress has plainly exercised its authority “to define the jurisdiction of the \n10  lower federal courts,” Duldulao v. INS, 90 F.3d 396, 400 (9th Cir. 1996), and “make \n11  exceptions to the historic practice whereby courts review agency action.”  Bowen, 476 \n12  U.S. at 672-73; see also Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 120 (1946).  A court in \n13  this district found § 102(c) straightforward, declaring that it “restricted judicial review \n14  of any claims to constitutional claims.”  See Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, No. 04-272, 2005 \n15  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *28 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005).  Plaintiffs cannot dispute \n16  this.  Instead, they seek to evade it by claiming that the jurisdictional bar does not \n17  apply to the findings included in the waiver determinations that relate to § 102(a) or \n18  (b) and that the jurisdictional bar is not express enough to preclude ultra vires review.  \n19  Neither argument can defeat Congress’s unambiguous limitation on jurisdiction.3 \n20 \n21 \n22                                             \n3 Defendants agree that the Court has “jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,” Isau v. \n23 \nSmith, 511 F.3d 881, 891 (9th Cir. 2007), which makes it appropriate for the Court to \n24  review the parties’ arguments for and against jurisdiction here.  But this authority \ncannot, as California would have it, serve as an independent basis to determine merits \n25 \nquestions such as “whether Sections 102(a) and (b) authorize the San Diego and \n26  Calexico Projects.”  Cal. Reply at 4-5.  These are not “jurisdictional facts” necessary \nto assess the Court’s jurisdiction under § 102(c)(1)(A).  Isau, 511 F.3d at 891; see also \n27 \nUnited States v. Moreno-Morillo, 334 F.3d 819, 830 (9th Cir. 2003) (limiting inquiry \n28  to “necessary precursor to the district court’s determination regarding ... jurisdiction”). \n  5 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1383   Page 18 of 49\n \n1  A.  Plaintiffs Cannot Carve Up Each Waiver Determination into \nMultiple Distinct Decisions Subject to APA Review  \n2 \nPlaintiffs claim that they should be free to challenge the Secretary’s findings \n3 \nregarding the need to install infrastructure on the notion that this is a “cause[] of \n4 \naction[] unrelated to waiver decisions.”  Id. at 9.  This argument fails for two reasons.  \n5 \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ efforts to cabin the jurisdictional bar so narrowly leaves them paying \n6 \nonly lip service to the statutory text.  After all, even in “attempt[ing] to read the \n7 \njurisdiction stripping provisions . . . narrowly, [a court] cannot escape the principle \n8 \nthat ‘courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means \n9 \nin a statute what it says.’”  Maldonado v. Fasano, 67 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1182 n.13 \n10 \n(S.D. Cal. 1999) (quoting Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 \n11 \n(1992)).  And second, Plaintiffs disregard the fact that the findings they wish to \n12 \nchallenge are integral to the waiver determination itself. \n13 \nPlaintiffs’ argument rests on § 102(c)(2)(A)’s use of the phrase “pursuant to \n14 \nparagraph (1)” to cross-reference § 102(c)(1).  See Coal. Reply at 8; Cal. Reply at 4; \n15 \nCtr. Reply at 2.  They claim that this phrase narrowly limits the jurisdictional bar to \n16 \nthe selection of what legal requirements to waive.  But their reading does not give \n17 \neffect to the full text of the provision.  See Spencer v. World Vision, Inc., 633 F.3d \n18 \n723, 743 (9th Cir. 2011) (“It is an elementary rule of construction that effect must be \n19 \ngiven, if possible, to every word, clause and sentence of a statute.”).  Even if the \n20 \nphrase “decision made . . . pursuant to paragraph (1)” in § 102(c)(2)(A) could \n21 \nplausibly refer to the waiver determination in isolation, cf. id. § 102(c)(1) (“[a]ny such \n22 \ndecision”), the text is more expansive in two ways.  First, the text also includes “any \n23 \naction undertaken . . . pursuant to paragraph (1),” which encompasses more than the \n24 \nwaiver determination itself.  Second, Congress expansively limited jurisdiction for “all \n25 \ncauses or claims arising from” such actions or decisions, not merely challenges to an \n26 \naction or decision in isolation.  Plaintiffs’ reading must be rejected because it would \n27 \nmake both “arising from” and “action undertaken” superfluous.  See Rodriguez v. \n28 \n  6 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1384   Page 19 of 49\n \n1  Robbins, No. 07-3239, 2012 WL 12953870, at *3 (C.D. Cal. May 3, 2012) (rejecting \n2  reading that would make “arising from the proceedings of which the . . . application is \n3  a part” redundant with “arising from the adjudication of the . . . application”); cf. \n4  Harland Clarke Holding Corp. v. Milken, 646 F. App’x 223, 227 (3d Cir. 2016) \n5  (interpreting contract so that separate “arising under” clause was not “superfluous”). \n6  Plaintiffs’ reading is also implausible because it would frustrate Congress’ \n7  purpose for the jurisdictional limitation and waiver provision—to prevent litigation \n8  delays.  See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72 at 172 (Conf. Rep.) (explaining congressional \n9  intent that “judicial review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the \n10  expeditious construction of border security infrastructure”).4  Plaintiffs’ reading would \n11  make every waiver determination subject to ordinary APA review for whether the \n12  project was really “necessary” in the first place.  See Coal. Reply at 11-12 (arguing \n13  that agency’s decision must justify “that these border infrastructure projects were \n14  ‘necessary,’” that they were in areas of high illegal entry, and that they were in the \n15  vicinity of the border); Cal. Reply at 12 (demanding “meaningful review of the \n16  Secretary’s actions” and “findings”).  This would cause the very litigation delays that \n17  § 102(c)(2)(A) targeted.   \n18  Here, Plaintiffs cannot establish that any of their legal challenges “arise” from \n19  something other than the decisions made and actions taken pursuant to § 102(c)(1)’s \n20  waiver authority.  The Secretary issued a single “notice of determination” for each of \n21  the two waiver decisions, including findings relevant to the statutory criteria that the \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n4 Plaintiffs cannot distinguish this clear statement of Congressional intent.  The same \n24  scope is reflected in the statements of individual legislators.  See Defs.’ Ex. 7, 151 \nCong. Rec. H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) (statement of Congresswoman Davis) (objecting to \n25 \nprovision because it “bars judicial review of any claim arising from the construction \n26  of barriers and roads at borders”); Defs.’ Ex. 8, 151 Cong. Rec. E247 (statement of \nCongressman James Langevin) (“This overly broad provision would give \n27 \nunprecedented power to the Secretary to undertake large construction projects without \n28  any accountability or judicial review.”). \n  7 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1385   Page 20 of 49\n \n1  waiver be “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n2  under this section.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  Plaintiffs rely on this notice as the “final \n3  agency action” purportedly subject to APA review, see Coal. Reply at 7, despite the \n4  fact that this is the very determination and action for which Congress strictly limited \n5  judicial review.  But Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, show that findings necessary for \n6  issuance of a waiver—which were included in the waiver determination itself—can be \n7  considered separate final agency actions.  And even if they could force such a \n8  distinction, they would still not evade Congress’s clear intent to encompass all \n9  “actions undertaken” pursuant to the waiver authority.  In sum, the APA does not give \n10  the Court jurisdiction that Congress has expressly withdrawn.     \n11  B.  Congress Barred Ultra Vires Challenges Along with Other Non-\nConstitutional Claims  \n12 \nDHS has shown that ultra vires review is not an inherent judicial authority, but \n13 \ninstead an application of the same rebuttable presumption of congressional intent to \n14 \npermit judicial review discussed above.  See Defs.’ Br. at 17-18 & n.10.  As the \n15 \nSupreme Court explained, Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184 (1958), and other ultra vires \n16 \ncases merely apply “the familiar proposition that only upon a showing of clear and \n17 \nconvincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to \n18 \njudicial review.”  Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. \n19 \n32, 44 (1991).  Kyne and its progeny do not authorize judicial review of every “agency \n20 \naction that is alleged to have exceeded the agency’s statutory authority.”  Id. at 43. \n21 \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs err in claiming that judicial review of whether an agency \n22 \nexceeded its statutory authority must always be available.  Coal. Reply at 1-2 & n.1; \n23 \nCal. Reply at 5.  As the D.C. Circuit observed, nothing “prevent[s] [Congress] from \n24 \nshielding even the most patent deviation from the statutory scheme from judicial \n25 \nredress where the Constitution is in no wise implicated.”  Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d \n26 \n607, 622 n.101 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (citing Switchmen’s Union v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., \n27 \n320 U.S. 297, 301 (1943)).  See also Estep, 327 U.S. at 120 (“[E]xcept when the \n28 \n  8 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1386   Page 21 of 49\n \n1  Constitution requires it, judicial review of administrative action may be granted or \n2  withheld as Congress chooses.”).  In Switchmen’s Union, the Supreme Court found \n3  that it lacked authority to consider an ultra vires claim because the Railway Labor Act \n4  impliedly precluded judicial review because congressional “intent seems plain” that \n5  “[t]here was to be no dragging of the controversy into other tribunals of law.”  See \n6  Switchmen’s Union, 320 U.S. at 305; id. at 301 (“All constitutional questions aside, it \n7  is for Congress to determine how the rights which it creates will be enforced.”).   \n8  Ninth Circuit caselaw is consistent with these principles.  For example, this \n9  month, the Ninth Circuit concluded it lacked jurisdiction to review an ultra vires \n10  challenge because 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(viii)(I) left the decision to the Secretary’s \n11  “sole and unreviewable discretion.”  Gebhardt v. Nielsen, _ F.3d _, 2018 WL 326238, \n12  at *5 (9th Cir. Jan. 9, 2018).  And in Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 682 (9th Cir. \n13  2017), the Ninth Circuit relied on Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.2d 1322, \n14  1327-28 (D.C. Cir. 1996), for the conclusion—undisputed here—that ultra vires \n15  review is not dependent on availability of the APA.5  In the passage cited favorably by \n16  Hawaii, the D.C. Circuit observed that while “courts are normally available to \n17  reestablish the limits on [executive] authority” when an ultra vires action occurs, “if \n18  Congress precluded [such] non-statutory judicial review . . . that would be another \n19  matter.”  74 F.2d at 1328.  Thus, the Hawaii decision is entirely consistent with the \n20  conclusion that Congress can bar ultra vires review if it chooses.6 \n21 \n                                           \n22  5 Hawaii described ultra vires review as a “cause of action[] which exists outside of \nthe APA.”  878 F.3d at 682.  Reich elaborates that the “enactment of the APA . . . does \n23 \nnot repeal the review of ultra vires actions recognized long before.”  74 F.2d at 1328.  \n24 \n6 California badly mischaracterizes Hawaii.  That case did not conclude “that courts \n‘necessarily’ retain jurisdiction to review whether executive actions are ‘ultra vires.’”  \n25 \nCal. Reply at 5 (quoting three words from Hawaii, 878 F.3d at 679).  Instead, the \n26 \nNinth Circuit simply stated that it was implicit in a prior Supreme Court case, that \n“[b]y reaching the merits” the Supreme Court “necessarily first decided that the Court \n27 \nhad jurisdiction.”  878 F.3d at 679.  Similarly, California omits key language that \n28 \ndistorts another quotation:  “It is the duty of the courts, in cases properly before them, \n  9 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1387   Page 22 of 49\n \n1  Plaintiffs gain no traction by pointing to a pair of Ninth Circuit cases \n2  characterizing 5 U.S.C. § 8128(b) as containing an “absolute jurisdictional bar” but \n3  nevertheless subject to ultra vires review.  See Coal. Reply at 2 (quoting Markham v. \n4  United States, 434 F.3d 1185, 1187 (9th Cir. 2006); Staacke v. U.S. Sec’y of Labor, \n5  841 F.2d 278, 281 (9th Cir. 1988)).  These cases, like all the others, turn on the \n6  question of what Congress intended to bar.  The “absolute” bar to which these cases \n7  refer is a “finality provision” prohibiting judicial review of the merits of an agency \n8  decision “allowing or denying a payment under this subchapter.”  Rodrigues v. \n9  Donovan, 769 F.2d 1344, 1347-48 (9th Cir. 1985).  Both cases cited by Plaintiffs rely \n10  on Rodrigues which makes clear that the inquiry is still one of “congressional intent.”  \n11  Id. at 1347.  The Ninth Circuit simply concluded that Congress did not intend this \n12  absolute bar on review of the merits to prohibit review of constitutional or ultra vires \n13  claims.  See id. at 1347-48 (reviewing constitutional claims because “Congress’s \n14  intent was that the courts not be burdened by a flood of small claims challenging the \n15  merits of compensation decisions . . . and that the Secretary should be left free to \n16  make the policy choices associated with disability decisions”); Staacke, 841 F.2d at \n17  281 (extending Rodrigues to ultra vires claims).   \n18  Congress is also free to bar ultra vires claims even if there is no other avenue \n19  for judicial review.  MCorp Financial makes clear that either of two factors prohibit \n20  judicial review under the Kyne exception:  1) if the absence of immediate judicial \n21  review would not “wholly deprive the [plaintiff] of a meaningful and adequate means \n22  of vindicating its statutory rights,” or 2) if “Congress has spoken clearly and directly” \n23  to preclude “review of the contested determination.”  502 U.S. at 43-44.  Plaintiffs \n24  argue that only the first factor matters.  They claim that even if Congress clearly \n25 \n                                           \n26  to say where those statutory and constitutional boundaries lie.”  878 F.3d at 679 \n(emphasis added); cf. Cal. Reply at 5 (omitting the emphasized clause).

See Ctr. Reply at 4-5; Coal. Reply at 2-3, Cal. Reply at 5.  This view \n3  inherently conflicts with Kyne’s logic of congressional intent, which depends on the \n4  observation that courts “cannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial \n5  protection of rights it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated \n6  powers.”  358 U.S. at 190 (emphasis added).  And MCorp Financial treated each \n7  factor as an independently “critical” distinction precluding review.  See 502 U.S. at \n8  43; see id. at 44 (“[T]he statute provides us with clear and convincing evidence that \n9  Congress intended to deny the District Court jurisdiction to review and enjoin the \n10  [challenged agency action].”).7  The Ninth Circuit has recognized as much.  See, e.g., \n11  Pinnacle Armor, 648 F.3d at 719 (relying on MCorp Financial to conclude that the \n12  presumption of judicial review for administrative action “is overcome” when \n13  “Congress expressly bars review by statute,” without reference to other avenues for \n14  judicial review).  Nor is such a reading necessary as a matter of constitutional \n15  avoidance.  See infra, Arg. § IV (showing that Plaintiffs’ constitutional arguments that \n16  judicial review is essential are meritless). \n17  In § 102(c)(2)(A), Congress has adopted language radically different from the \n18  finality provisions common in other statutes.  In expressly stating “[t]he court shall \n19  not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph,” Congress \n20  made clear that its purpose was broader than banning judicial review of the merits of \n21 \n22                                             \n7 Plaintiffs misuse the Supreme Court’s observation that the “clarity of the \n23 \ncongressional preclusion of review” factor is “related” to the vindication factor.  This \n24  observation does not mean that the preclusion factor is “inextricably . . . bound up \nwith” the vindication factor.  Ctr. Reply at 5.  The Supreme Court’s discussion of both \n25 \nfactors does not make either one irrelevant standing alone.  Instead, it suggest that \n26  either “critical” factor can be fatal to judicial review under the “narrow window” \nrecognized by Kyne.  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281.  And, by concluding with an \n27 \nemphasis on “clear and convincing evidence” of Congress’s intent, 502 U.S. at 44, \n28  MCorp Financial suggests that the second factor may be more dispositive.   \n  11 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1389   Page 24 of 49\n \n1  the waiver determination.8  Cf.

OPM, 470 U.S. 768, 779-80 (1985) \n2  (“[W]hen Congress intends to bar judicial review altogether, it typically employs \n3  language far more unambiguous and comprehensive than” 5 U.S.C. § 8347(c)’s \n4  provision that “decisions concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not \n5  subject to review”).  In permitting only constitutional claims to proceed, Congress was \n6  preempting all other sources of litigation delay.  Cf. United States v. Spiegel, 995 F.2d \n7  138, 140 (9th Cir. 1993) (interpreting statute at issue in MCorp Financial to “leave[] \n8  no room to doubt that Congress provided only one avenue for challenging” covered \n9  agency action).  It is difficult to imagine language more tailored to prohibiting ultra \n10  vires review.  Congress’s choice must be respected.  “Federal courts are not, after all, \n11  superlegislatures entitled to invoke a generalized presumption to trump an express \n12  ‘hands off’ direction from Congress.”  Am.

TO THE EXTENT THE COURT CONDUCTS ULTRA VIRES REVIEW, \nPLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO MAKE THE “TWO-PART” \n15  SHOWING REQUIRED IN THIS CIRCUIT \n16 \nEven if Congress’s intent to prohibit ultra vires review was unconvincing, \n17 \nPlaintiffs have not established that they satisfy Kyne’s “narrow exception” by making \n18 \nthe “two-part showing” required in this Circuit:  (1) that the challenged action \n19 \n“contravene[s] clear and mandatory statutory language” and (2) that “absent district \n20 \ncourt jurisdiction, [plaintiff would] be wholly deprived of a meaningful and adequate \n21 \nmeans of vindicating its statutory rights.”  Pacific Mar. Ass’n v. NLRB, 827 F.3d \n22 \n1203, 1208 (9th Cir. 2016).  Plaintiffs’ failure to establish either of these prongs is \n23 \nfatal to their attempt to invoke ultra vires review. \n24 \n25 \n                                           \n26  8 Plaintiffs err in suggesting that finality provisions “are more preclusive than § 102.”  \nCtr. Reply at 7.  As discussed above, a finality provision’s absoluteness has often been \n27 \nfound to shield the merits of a decision from review.  Here, by contrast, Congress \n28  expressly barred any form of jurisdiction except the review of constitutional claims. \n  12 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1390   Page 25 of 49\n \n1  A.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established That They Have Statutory Rights to \nVindicate Through Litigation \n2 \nDHS has shown that courts have emphasized that nonstatutory ultra vires \n3 \nreview is appropriate only as a last resort to protect statutory rights.  See Defs.’ Br. at \n4 \n23-25; see, e.g., MCorp Fin., 502 U.S. at 43 (explaining that the fact that the plaintiff \n5 \nwould have been “wholly deprive[d] . . . of a . . . means of vindicating its statutory \n6 \nrights” was “central to our decision in Kyne” (emphasis added)).  Accordingly, \n7 \nPlaintiffs cannot merely identify a “statutory obligation” for the agency, but instead \n8 \nmust identify a “statutory right” by which Plaintiffs are entitled to vindication.  See \n9 \nCal. Sportfishing Prot. Alliance v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, No. 15-912, 2015 WL \n10 \n6167521, at *11 & n.8 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2015).  Plaintiffs make no attempt to \n11 \nestablish that their ultra vires claims are tied to a statutory right providing individual \n12 \nbenefits.  See Cal. Reply at 5 n.4 (merely expressing interest in “prevent[ing] the \n13 \nSecretary from taking unchecked actions that exceed statutory authority”).  Nor could \n14 \nthey, because the statutory language they seek to enforce is general and not the sort of \n15 \nlanguage creating statutory rights.  See, e.g., Logan v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, 722 F.3d \n16 \n1163, 1171 (9th Cir. 2013); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n17 \nPlaintiffs do not seek to vindicate their own statutory rights but instead pursue their \n18 \nabstract interests in enforcing their own interpretation of the statute.  Accordingly, it \n19 \nwould be an unwarranted extension of ultra vires review to apply it to the \n20 \ncircumstances here.9   \n21 \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n9 California appears to assert that it need not respond to this claim because DHS \n24  “conceded” that the prong is not in dispute.  See Cal. Reply at 5 n.4.  This is incorrect \nfor two reasons.  First, for DHS to make a more limited argument as to one plaintiff \n25 \ndoes not concede the issue as to another plaintiff in a separate cause of action.  \n26  Second, the passage California cites focused on the judicial review aspect of the \nprong, and said nothing about the statutory rights aspect of the prong.  See Defs.’ Br. \n27 \nat 16 n.10.  DHS has therefore not contradicted its prior observation, but merely \n28  developed another aspect of the prong in light of the California Sportfishing decision. \n  13 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1391   Page 26 of 49\n \n1  B.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established that the Secretary Violated Any \nClear Command in the Statute \n2 \nAlternatively, under the extraordinarily deferential ultra vires review standard, \n3 \nthe Court must conclude that the Secretary did not exceed his statutory authority.  As \n4 \nthe Ninth Circuit has explained: \n5 \nOur task is limited to determining whether the statute in question \n6 \ncontains a clear command that the Secretary has transgressed. Where . . . \n7  the statute is capable of two plausible interpretations, the Secretary’s \ndecision to adopt one interpretation over the other cannot constitute a \n8 \nviolation of a clear statutory mandate.   \n9 \nStaacke, 841 F.2d at 282; see also Pacific Mar. Ass’n, 827 F.3d at 1208 (agency \n10 \naction must “contravene clear and mandatory statutory language”).10  None of \n11 \nPlaintiffs’ arguments render the Secretary’s interpretation of § 102 implausible.  \n12 \nAccordingly, their ultra vires claims must be denied. \n13 \n1.  Section 102(a) plausibly states a general mandate that can be \n14  applied apart from the specific Congressional priorities \nidentified in § 102(b) \n15 \nDHS has shown that § 102(a) provides a general mandate calling for the \n16 \nSecretary to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical \n17 \nbarriers and roads” along the border.  Defs.’ Br. at 26-35.  The government has \n18 \nconsistently taken the position that “section 102(a) confers authority on the Secretary \n19 \nto construct barriers in the vicinity of the U.S.-Mexico border, including the San \n20 \nDiego Barrier, that are not explicitly mandated by section 102(b).”  Save Our Heritage \n21 \nOrg. v. Gonzales, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58, 60 (D.D.C. 2008) (characterizing the \n22 \ngovernment’s position); see also Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 6-7, ECF No. 36, Sierra \n23 \nClub, et al. v. Ashcroft, et al., No. 04-0272 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2005) (arguing that \n24 \n§ 102(b)(1) simply provided “a required method of achieving [§ 102(a)’s] important \n25 \n26                                             \n10 The Center cannot avoid this standard by citing a standard for determining whether \n27 \nthe court had jurisdiction to review an ultra vires claim.  See Ctr. Reply at 8.  Once a \n28  court finds jurisdiction, it looks for a “clear command.”  Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282. \n  14 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1392   Page 27 of 49\n \n1  goal in one geographic area”).  And the only court to address the issue agreed.  See \n2  Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (holding “that section 102(a), on its face, \n3  authorizes construction of barriers such as the San Diego Barrier in areas that the \n4  Secretary determines are areas of high illegal entry into the United States”). \n5  Plaintiffs’ restrictive view that § 102 only empowers Congress to construct the \n6  projects selected by Congress in § 102(b) would produce odd results.  As noted in \n7  Save Our Heritage, it would mean that when Congress struck language about \n8  construction near San Diego from § 102(b)(1) and replaced it with language regarding \n9  five other locations, see Defs.’ Br. at 3 (discussing Secure Fence Act), Congress was \n10  foreclosing further reliance on § 102 for construction near San Diego (which remained \n11  ongoing until at least 2007).  See Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 60 (rejecting \n12  argument that 2006 amendment made “construction of the San Diego Barrier . . . no \n13  longer authorized by statute”).  But instead, Congress’s amendment of § 102(b) \n14  merely sixteen months after it vigorously pressed for completion of the San Diego \n15  Barrier in 2005 demonstrates that § 102(b) is a repository for congressional priorities \n16  rather than the exclusive list of projects that may be constructed under § 102.11  Cf. \n17  Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (refusing to “interpret the 2006 amendment \n18  to section 102(b) as narrowing the Secretary’s authority” because “[t]he statute’s \n19  explicit language does not support such an interpretation.”). \n20    Indeed, Plaintiffs offer no response to DHS’s demonstration that Congress has \n21  routinely used the phrase “in carrying out” to bridge between a general mandate and \n22  specific guidance.  See Defs.’ Br. at 29 & n.20; see, e.g., 33 U.S.C. § 2326(a)(1)(A), \n23  (f) (giving Secretary of the Interior general responsibility to “develop . . . regional \n24  sediment management plans” and specifying that “[i]n carrying out this section, the \n25 \n                                           \n26  11 Plaintiffs suggest that Save Our Heritage is somehow “distinguishable” because \nCongress had previously “primarily focused on the completion” of the San Diego \n27 \ninfrastructure.  Ctr. Reply at 10 n.7.  But Plaintiffs’ theory demands that the current \n28  text of § 102(b) controls, not prior versions. \n  15 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1393   Page 28 of 49\n \n1  Secretary shall give priority to [projects] in the vicinity of [eleven specific \n2  locations]”).  Nor do Plaintiffs meaningfully respond to DHS’s three key reasons \n3  Plaintiffs’ interpretation should be rejected:   \n4  1) specific requirements cannot generally be understood to prohibit all \nother applications of the general authority,12 see Barnhart v. Peabody \n5 \nCoal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003); FTC v. Tarriff, 584 F.3d 1088, 1091 \n6  (D.C. Cir. 2009); Otsuka Pharm. Co. v. Burwell, No. 15-852, 2015 WL \n1962240, at *7 (D. Md.

Supp. 2d at 61;  \n8 \n(2) the specific terms of the IIRIRA as originally enacted cut sharply \n9  against Plaintiffs’ reading because the broad mandate would be confusing \nand superfluous if Congress had already identified the only location for \n10 \nconstruction,13 see Hooks v. Ktsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 F.3d \n11  550, 560 (9th Cir. 2016); Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden, \n376 F.3d 908, 929 (9th Cir. 2004); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Am. \n12 \nGuaranty Life Ins. Co., 722 F.2d 1498, 1500 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled \n13  on other grounds by In re McLinn, 739 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1984), and  \n14  (3) the changes to § 102(b) made in 2006 and 2007 further demonstrate \nthat this subsection merely identifies reflects Congress’ shifting \n15 \npriorities.  See Defs.’ Br. at 32-33.   \n16 \nPlaintiffs cannot overcome these textual and contextual reasons based on the \n17 \nlegislative history or the Sierra Club decision.  While it is undisputed that completion \n18 \n19                                             \n12 Plaintiffs’ observation that “[j]udicial decisions addressing eminent domain disputes \n20 \nconsistently cite[d] to § 102(b),” Ctr. Reply at 11, is not in tension with DHS’s \n21  position because those land acquisitions were implementing Congress’s priority \nprojects identified in § 102(b).  It is logical to cite the most specific authority for the \n22 \nagency’s actions, without implying that there is no other authority available. \n23 \n13 The Center suggests that Bear Valley Mut. Water Co. v. Jewell, 790 F.3d 977 (9th \n24  Cir. 2015) demonstrates that Plaintiffs’ reading would not render § 102(a) surplusage.  \nThat case rejected an attempt to enforce “Congressional findings and declarations of \n25 \npurposes and policy” on the ground that the provision was a “non-operative statement \n26  of policy.”  790 F.3d at 986-87.  This case does not help Plaintiffs because on the one \nhand, they rely on § 102(a) as more than an inoperative policy statement, and on the \n27 \nother hand, they cannot explain why the section’s substantive conditions were created \n28  in 1996 when there was only one project listed in § 102(b). \n  16 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1394   Page 29 of 49\n \n1  of the San Diego project was the catalyst for passage of § 102 and the 2005 \n2  amendment, DHS has shown that the legislative history establishes that the scope of \n3  the provisions was obviously broader and was not limited to that one project.  See \n4  Defs.’ Ex. 1, H.R. Rep. 104-828 at 200 (Sept. 24, 1996) (Conf. Rep.) (broadly \n5  describing § 102 as “requir[ing] the Attorney General to install additional fences and \n6  roads to deter illegal immigration” and separately characterizing the construction \n7  Congress had called for “[i]n the San Diego Sector”); H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May \n8  3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (broadly describing § 102 as “provid[ing] for construction and \n9  strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders”); see also id. at 171 (describing the \n10  waiver authority as “ensur[ing] expeditious construction of barriers and roads” and \n11  “the expeditious construction of security infrastructure along the border”); Defs.’ Br. \n12  at 34-35 & n.28 (quoting the uncontradicted, repeated observations in Congress that \n13  the text of the waiver provision extended beyond the San Diego project).14     \n14  DHS has also explained that the Sierra Club decision should not be read to \n15  adopt Plaintiffs’ reading of the interaction between § 102(a) and (b).  See Defs.’ Br. at \n16  30-31 n.21.  Sierra Club’s observations about the “barriers and roads” to which § \n17  102(c) was being applied are best understood as references to the fact that the \n18  delegated authority was only being used for a construction project that Congress itself \n19  had specified.  See 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *8-9 (emphasizing Congress’s \n20  selection of the 14-mile location for construction); id. at *19 (“[T]he ‘barriers and \n21  roads’ alluded to are the same in both articulations of Section 102(c): the Triple Fence \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n14 At most, Plaintiffs could claim that the legislative history is indeterminate based on \n24  the perceived tension between the portions of that history cited by DHS and Plaintiffs’  \ncitation of portions of the legislative history in which proponents of the legislation \n25 \nexclusively discussed the San Diego catalyst.  See, e.g., Ctr. Reply at 13.  But the \n26  evidence is not contradictory, and regardless an indeterminate legislative history \ncannot be a basis for overruling a reasonable interpretation of the statutory text.  See \n27 \nUnited States v. Meeks, 366 F.3d 705, 720 (9th Cir. 2004); Student Loan Fund of \n28  Idaho, Inc. v.

Cf. Osborn v. Bartos, No. 08-2193, 2010 WL 3809847, at \n6  *4 n.8 (D. Ariz. Sept. 20, 2010) (rejecting as nonpersuasive another district court \n7  decision that “proffered no explanation” for its conclusion).  Such a mistaken \n8  assumption certainly would not render the government’s interpretation of § 102 \n9  implausible or clearly erroneous.  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282; Pacific Mar. Ass’n, \n10  827 F.3d at 1208. \n11  In sum, the government’s consistent interpretation of § 102(a) as calling for \n12  additional construction of border infrastructure beyond the specific locations \n13  identified by Congress in § 102(b) does not “contravene clear and mandatory statutory \n14  language,” Pacific Mar. Ass’n, 827 F.3d at 1208, and cannot be the basis for striking \n15  down agency action under ultra vires review. \n16  2.  Plaintiffs have not shown that § 102(c) waiver authority has \nunambiguously expired \n17 \nDHS has shown that Plaintiffs’ argument that the December 31, 2008 deadline \n18 \nin § 102(b)(1)(B) applies generally to § 102(c) or § 102 as a whole is wholly \n19 \nimplausible.  See Defs.’ Br. at 36-38.  Congress plainly expected construction under § \n20 \n102 to continue after the end of 2008.  It set this deadline in December 2007 to ensure \n21 \nthat 370 miles of construction in “[p]riority areas” was completed within one year.  \n22 \nIIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(B).  But the deadline plainly did not apply to the simultaneous \n23 \nrequirement to “construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the \n24 \nsouthwest border,” id. § 102(b)(1)(A), for which construction continued after 2008.  \n25 \nAnd if the deadline did not apply to other provisions of § 102(b), it certainly cannot be \n26 \ninterpreted to require the sunsetting of § 102(a) and 102(c) authority.

Not so.  The deadlines performed their purpose.  They were not intended to \n2  limit DHS authority to construct border infrastructure in the future, but instead were \n3  intended to ensure that DHS moved quickly to construct a minimum amount of \n4  additional infrastructure within the following year. \n5  3.  Plaintiffs have not shown that § 102(c) unambiguously requires \nthat the Federal Register notice of a waiver determination \n6  include detailed “findings” \n \n7 \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs’ argument that the waiver determination must \n8 \ninclude detailed “findings necessary for adequate judicial review,” Cal. Reply at 12; \n9 \nCoal. Reply at 11, depends on the mistaken belief that APA review is available for \n10 \nsome aspects of the waiver determination.  See supra, Arg. § II(A).  And general \n11 \ncaselaw about what is required to pass muster under APA review, see, e.g., Cal. Reply \n12 \nat 12 (citing Dickson v. Sec’y of Defense, 68 F.3d 1396, 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1995)), \n13 \ncannot give rise to an ultra vires claim.  Plaintiffs point to no statutory requirement \n14 \nthat the Federal Register notice contain such findings.  See IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) \n15 \n(stating only that notice of the Secretary’s decision must be “published in the Federal \n16 \nRegister”); cf. H.R. Rep. 109-72, at 170 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (explaining that \n17 \nthe limited purpose of the publication requirement was to “ensur[e] appropriate public \n18 \nnotice of such determinations”).15  DHS has shown that ultra vires review should, at \n19 \nmost, reach no further than confirming that the Secretary made the determination on \n20 \nthe basis of the statutory criteria, see Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281 (looking only for \n21 \nviolation of “a clear statutory mandate or prohibition”); Am. Airlines v. Herman, 176 \n22 \nF.3d 283, 293 (5th Cir. 1999) (“a plain violation of an unambiguous and mandatory \n23 \nprovision of the statute”), and that the Secretary’s determinations were made on the \n24 \nbasis of the statutory criteria.

Plaintiffs cannot show that key statutory terms unambiguously \npreclude the waiver determinations at issue here \n4 \nOn reply, Plaintiffs continue to press the Court to engage in ordinary APA \n5 \nreview of three phrases in § 102 under the guise of ultra vires review.  See Cal. Br. at \n6 \n6-10; Coal. Br. at 10-14.17  None of the statutory phrases unambiguously preclude the \n7 \nuse of § 102(c) waiver authority for the construction projects at issue here. \n8 \na.  “Additional barriers and roads” \n9 \nDHS has shown that § 102(a)’s provision for “install[ing] additional physical \n10 \nbarriers” should not be read to exclude replacement of existing infrastructure with \n11 \ntaller and more operationally effective barriers.  See Defs.’ Br. at 42-44.  It is evident \n12 \nthat Congress intended “additional” in a capacious sense.  First, Congress expressly \n13 \nincluded “the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants” within the meaning \n14 \nof the term, § 102(a); along with the installation of “lighting, cameras, and sensors,” \n15 \nid. § 102(b)(1)(A).

Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (emphasis added)); see also 152 \n18 \nCong. Rec. S9871 (Sept. 21, 2006) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (discussing using § 102 \n19 \n                                           \n20 \n16 California claims that “DHS and its Secretary have made public statements \n21  contradicting” the findings in the waiver determinations.  Cal. Reply at 12.  This is \nuntrue.  Comments about the general effectiveness of border infrastructure, see Defs.’ \n22 \nResp. to Stmts. of Facts at 31, are not inconsistent with the need to replace outmoded \n23  1990s fencing; and sector-wide priority assessments, see id. at 38-39, do not suggest \nthat specific areas cannot meet § 102’s “high illegal entry” requirement.  Plaintiffs \n24 \nhave not overcome the presumption of regularity that attaches to agency action.  See \n25  U.S. Postal Serv. v. Gregory, 534 U.S. 1, 10 (2001); San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water \nAuth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, 601 (9th Cir. 2014). \n26 \n17 Because Plaintiffs make no further arguments on reply regarding the phrases “deter \n27 \nillegal crossings,” and “most practical and effective,” DHS rests on its prior brief \n28  addressing those arguments.

And there is no inherent dichotomy \n4  between “replacement” and “additional.”  See Defs.’ Br. at 42 (comparing dictionary \n5  definitions).18  It is implausible that Congress gave DHS only one shot at improving \n6  border security at any given location under § 102.  Nor can repair of infrastructure be \n7  excluded from the scope of § 102, see Cal. Reply at 9-10, without substantially \n8  impairing DHS’s ability to maintain infrastructure in locations that depend on § 102’s \n9  waiver authority.  See, e.g., Defs.’ Ex. 10, Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 17 \n10  (explaining that a waiver is necessary for construction in “national wildlife refuges \n11  and wilderness areas”).  Indeed, DHS has used § 102 to replace fencing in the past.  \n12  See, e.g., Defs.’ Ex. 23, U.S. Border Patrol, Envt’l Stewardship Plan for Nogales \n13  Fence Replacement Project (Nov. 2011) (attached). \n14  b.  “Areas of high illegal entry” \n15  DHS has shown that it would be unwarranted for a court, as Plaintiffs propose, \n16  see Cal. Reply at 6-9, to set some absolute threshold for “high illegal entry” based on \n17  a comparison to the flow of illegal immigration at the time the statute was enacted or \n18  amended.  See Defs.’ Br. at 44-48.  Congress set no specific threshold for “high illegal \n19  entry” and any interpretation of the term must be tied to the Act’s purpose, as \n20  amended, “to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border” \n21  § 102(b)(1)(D), and Congress’s choice to continue to use § 102 even though illegal \n22  immigration had significantly declined from 1990s levels.  See Defs.’ Br. at 44-45.  \n23  Thus, California’s claim that 100,000 apprehensions per year in a sector would not \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n18 California now argues that because the 2007 Amendments “focus solely on adding \n26  mileage to the existing inventory,” the term “additional” must be defined with that \ngoal in mind.  Cal. Reply at 9.  But this one application of § 102(a) authority does not \n27 \nreasonably narrow the broad scope of the term, especially where none of the prior \n28  versions of § 102(b)(1) focused on mileage. \n  21 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1399   Page 34 of 49\n \n1  qualify as “high illegal entry,” Cal.

The Secretary concluded here \n4  that each project area and the sector in which it was located remained an area of high \n5  illegal entry.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35984, 42830.  DHS does not maintain that § 102 \n6  would authorize construction where such a finding could not be made.  But there is no \n7  need to settle on a threshold for purposes of ultra vires review here because tens of \n8  thousands of illegal entries of people and contraband per year plausibly comes within \n9  the plain meaning of the term.  See id.19 \n10  DHS does not dispute the Coalition Plaintiffs’ suggestion that “high” involves \n11  “a relative description” and “must at least mean the opposite of ‘areas of low illegal \n12  entry.’”  Coal. Reply at 12.  DHS simply maintains that “high” and “low” must be \n13  assessed in light of the congressionally-imposed goal of operational control.20  And \n14  here, where both sectors are in the upper third of sectors nationwide as ranked by \n15  number of apprehensions, see Ex. 18, U.S. Border Patrol, Sector Profile – Fiscal Year \n16 \n                                           \n17  19 Plaintiffs err in claiming that contraband seizure statistics are irrelevant.  See Cal. \nReply at 8 n.9.  Congress included contraband in its definition of operational control.  \n18 \nSee Pub. L. No. 109-367 § 2(b).  And CBP maintains separate statistics for seizures at \n19  ports of entry by its Office of Field Operations and seizures between ports of entry by \nU.S. Border Patrol.  See, e.g., CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018 (link); CBP, \n20 \nBorder Security: Along U.S. Borders (link) (explaining that U.S. Border Patrol is \n21  responsible for the area “between ports of entry”).  \n22  20 DHS does not argue that high illegal entry is “equivalent to those areas of which \nBorder Patrol lacks ‘operational control.’”  Coal. Reply at 12.  Plaintiffs have not \n23 \nshown that consideration of “operational control” is irrelevant to the relative \n24  assessment required by “areas of high illegal entry.”  While they suggest that 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1330(b)(3)(A)(iii), which references “areas experiencing high levels of \n25 \napprehensions of illegal aliens,” is useful for interpreting § 102(a), they do not explain \n26  how that language would further support any specific interpretation.  See Coal. Reply \nat 13 n.7.  Indeed, the most obvious result of a comparison is to suggest that § 102(a) \n27 \nis broader because it is not limited the “apprehensions” of people but also includes \n28  illegal entry of contraband.  See Defs.’ Br. at 45 n.35.  \n  22 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1400   Page 35 of 49\n \n1  2016, it cannot reasonably be concluded that these projects are in areas of \n2  comparatively “low” illegal entry.  Plaintiffs cannot defeat the Secretary’s conclusion \n3  by relying on station-level data from 2004.  See Defs.’ Br. at 47 (explaining the \n4  limitations of the evidence in Cal. Ex. 22, which contains data from 1992 to 2004, \n5  including that the information is more than a decade out of date); Cal.

San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water \n8  Auth., 747 F.3d at 601 (providing “presumption of regularity” to agency action). \n9  c.   “Consultation” \n10  Finally, the Coalition Plaintiffs have not established that § 102(b)(1)(C)’s \n11  consultation requirement is a basis for invalidating a waiver determination.  As DHS \n12  has explained, nothing in the waiver provision is expressly or implicitly dependent on \n13  completion of the consultation requirement.  See Defs.’ Br. at 50-51.  Nor can \n14  Plaintiffs separately enforce the provision because it does not give rise to a private \n15  cause of action.  See IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(C)(ii) (stating that consultation requirement \n16  does not “create . . . any right of action for a . . . person or entity affected by this \n17  subsection”); Texas Border Coal. v. Napolitano, 614 F. Supp. 2d 54, (D.D.C. 2009).  \n18  Plaintiffs offer no response to DHS’s arguments.  At any rate, consultation pursuant to \n19  this provision is ongoing.  See, e.g., Defs.’ Exs. 24-27 (attached to this filing) \n20  (coordination letters regarding the Calexico project dated January 18 and 19, 2018).   \n21  In sum, each of these statutory terms fails to provide Plaintiffs with a “clear \n22  command that the Secretary has transgressed.”  Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282.  Instead, \n23  their arguments suggest that at most “the statute is capable of two plausible \n24  interpretations,” and the Ninth Circuit has held that “the Secretary’s decision to adopt \n25  one interpretation over the other cannot constitute a violation of a clear statutory \n26  mandate.”  Id.; see also Griffith v.

PLAINTIFFS’ CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS FAIL \n3  Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, the only claims properly before the Court, \n4  IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A), fail to establish that Congress cannot (1) permit the Secretary \n5  to determine which laws to waive and (2) strictly limit judicial review of such waiver \n6  determinations.21 \n7  A.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Article I § 1 \n8  DHS has shown that § 102(c) does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative \n9  power to the DHS Secretary.  See Defs.’ Br. at 52-57.  As the Ninth Circuit observed, \n10  the last time the Supreme Court “invalidated legislation under this doctrine” was more \n11  than “seventy-five years ago.”  In re Nat’l Security Agency Telecomm. Records Litig. \n12  (hereinafter “Telecomm. Records”), 671 F.3d 881, 895 (9th Cir. 2011).  And every \n13  court to consider a nondelegation challenge to § 102(c) has rejected it, beginning with \n14  a decision in this district.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *16-25; \n15  see also County of El Paso v. Chertoff, No. 08-196, 2008 WL 4372693, at *2-4 (W.D. \n16  Tex. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 915 (2009); Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at \n17  63-64; Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2007), cert. \n18  denied, 554 U.S. 918 (2008).   \n19  Here, Congress provided “an intelligible principle to which the person or body \n20  authorized to [act] is directed to conform.”  J.W. Hampton, Jr. Co. v. United States, \n21  276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).22  DHS has shown that § 102(a) delineates a “general \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n21 The Center’s Take Care Clause claim under Article II § 3 is not further addressed \n24  here because briefing has been completed on that claim.  See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at \n30-33, ECF No. 18-1; Defs.’ Br. at 63-65. \n25 \n22 California claims that J.W. Hampton and a predecessor case “limit” the \n26 \nnondelegation doctrine where the delegated power is the “modifi[cation] or \nterminat[ion]” of tariffs or laws.  Cal. Reply at 19.

United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373 (1989)—that improving border \n2  protection by expediting the construction of necessary barriers and roads is a high \n3  Congressional priority.  See, e.g., Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20; \n4  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127.  There is also no doubt about “the \n5  boundaries of this delegated authority.”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 373.  Congress \n6  included a geographic boundary—waivers may only be issued in connection with \n7  construction “in the vicinity of the United States border.”  See Defs.’ Br. at 54 \n8  (quoting IIRIRA § 102(a)).  And Congress included temporal “necessity” as a second \n9  boundary.  See id. § 102(c)(2) (permitting waiver of legal requirements where \n10  “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” at those locations); Defenders of \n11  Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127.  As DHS has explained, Congress adopted this \n12  approach of targeted flexibility because it could not sufficiently anticipate the ways \n13  that existing laws would be wielded to frustrate Congress’ priorities.  See Defs.’ Br. at \n14  55.  Such “necessity” determinations can be delegated.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \n15  Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001); Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 163 (1991). \n16  On reply, Plaintiffs emphasize that, in Whitman, the discretion provided under \n17  the Clean Air Act to set air quality standards for particular pollutants depended on \n18  significant technical background and criteria.  See Coal. Reply at 17.  But this cannot \n19  take away from the extraordinary discretion involved in “setting air standards that \n20  affect the entire national economy.”  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475 (not requiring “the \n21  statute to decree . . . how ‘necessary’ was necessary enough”).  Despite Plaintiffs’ \n22  protestations to the contrary, § 102 involves far less than such a “sweeping regulatory \n23  scheme[].”  Id.  Waiving laws to expedite border infrastructure construction is a far \n24  more limited power.  Accordingly, it can appropriately include less “substantial \n25  guidance.”  Id. (“[T]he degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according \n26                                             \nthat the triggering event had occurred.  J.W. Hampton, at 410-11.  California cites no \n27 \nauthority suggesting that these cases create a heightened standard for any category of \n28  cases.  For that reason, DHS did not discuss them separately. \n  25 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1403   Page 38 of 49\n \n1  to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.”). As discussed above, the \n2  guidance and boundaries Congress provided are sufficient.  While Plaintiffs wish \n3  Congress had adopted additional restrictions, such as applying § 102 exclusively to \n4  the U.S.-Mexico border, Coal. Reply at 18, the absence of such restrictions does not \n5  make the delegated authority unconstitutional.   \n6  Finally, as other courts have recognized, Congress may delegate in broader \n7  terms regarding border infrastructure because the Executive Branch has significant \n8  independent control over immigration, foreign affairs, and national security.  See \n9  Defs.’ Br. at 56; Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *22-23; Defenders of \n10  Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 126, 129; cf. Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 897 \n11  (holding that when the delegation “arises within the realm of national security . . . the \n12  intelligible principle standard need not be overly rigid”).  While it must “still [be] the \n13  Legislative Branch, not the Executive Branch, that makes the law,” Zivotofsky v. \n14  Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2079 (2015), Congress has made the law here.  The delegated \n15  authority to waive laws impeding expeditious construction of this important \n16  infrastructure does not usurp that function.  \n17  B.

Reply at 18.  \n20  But DHS has shown that none of Plaintiffs’ citations support this sweeping \n21  conclusion, and that it would be counterintuitive to conclude that Congress had less \n22  power to delegate authority to relieve criminal sanctions than in other areas.  See \n23  Defs.’ Br. at 57-58.  Plaintiffs certainly cannot derive such a principle from the dictum \n24  that “no one is above the law.”  That dictum has no meaningful application here where \n25  the seven criminal provisions to which they point, Cal. Reply at 19 n.17, were not \n26  waived to encourage or protect otherwise criminal action, but instead are merely part \n27  of broader waivers of the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water \n28 \n  26 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1404   Page 39 of 49\n \n1  Act, and other less prominent statutes, to avoid civil litigation and expedite \n2  construction.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985, 42830. \n3  C.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Article I § 7 \n4  Plaintiffs’ claims under the Presentment Clauses fail because the waiver \n5  determinations at issue here do not constitute “partial repeal” of the underlying \n6  statutes.  See Defs.’ Br. at 58-62.  The Supreme Court holds that the Constitution does \n7  not authorize the President “to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Clinton v. City \n8  of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  But limited waivers of statutory provisions \n9  have never been held to fall afoul of this principle.  Both courts to consider such a \n10  challenge to § 102(c) have rejected it.  See County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at \n11  *6-7; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 123-26.  Accordingly, the parties \n12  dedicate very little space in their reply briefs to preserving this claim.  See Ctr. Reply \n13  at 18-19; Cal. Reply at 20. \n14  DHS has shown that the waivers at issue here differ in dispositive ways from \n15  the Line Item Veto Act, which gave the President the authority to “cancel” certain \n16  appropriated spending items that had been passed by Congress.  Clinton, 524 U.S. at \n17  438.  That statute failed because cancellation prevented the items “from having legal \n18  force or effect” and thus in “both legal and practical effect, the President has amended \n19  two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each.”  Id.; see also id. at 447 (holding \n20  it improper to give the President “unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted \n21  statutes”).  Here, by contrast, the waivers prevent no statutory provision “from having \n22  legal force or effect” because the provisions continue in force for almost all of their \n23  applications.  See Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 124 (“Each of the [] laws \n24  waived by the Secretary . . . retains the same legal force and effect as it had when it \n25  was passed by both houses of Congress and presented to the President.”).23   \n26 \n                                           \n23 Plaintiffs quote an academic article by a recently graduated law student to show that \n27 \nDefenders of Wildlife was “wrong,” but that article’s reasoning about “a statutory \n28 \nbargain being overridden,” Ctr. Reply at 18, would be much more far reaching than \n  27 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1405   Page 40 of 49\n \n1  Plaintiffs do not respond to most of DHS’s argument.  They cannot dispute that \n2  then-Judge John Roberts characterized waivers as “a far cry from the line-item veto at \n3  issue in Clinton.”  See Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F.3d 41, 64 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2004) \n4  (Roberts, J., concurring).  Nor do they attempt to distinguish Telecommunications \n5  Records, in which the Ninth Circuit rejected a Presentment Clause challenge on the \n6  ground that an “executive grant of immunity or waiver of claim” has “never been \n7  recognized as a form of legislative repeal.”  See Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 895.  \n8  Such grants of immunity prevent civil actions to enforce the otherwise applicable \n9  laws, just as the waivers prevent civil actions to enforce the environmental statutes, \n10  but the Ninth Circuit found no constitutional defect because “[t]he law remains as it \n11  was when Congress approved it and the President signed it.”  Id. at 894-95.24  \n12  Plaintiffs also offer no response to DHS’s explanation that § 102(c) does not raise the \n13  same separation of powers concerns as Clinton because there is nothing unseemly in \n14  the Secretary’s implementation of the intent Congress expressed in 2005 for the \n15  narrow waiver of NEPA, the ESA, and the CZMA, passed decades earlier.  See Smith \n16  v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 280 F. Supp. 2d 314, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Moyle v. \n17  Dir., Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 147 F.3d 1116, 1120 (9th Cir. \n18  1998); Maldonado, 67 F. Supp. 2d at 1180. \n19  Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that DHS’s approach lacks a limiting principle.  See \n20  Ctr. Reply at 19.  But DHS has expressly provided one:  “[u]nder the logic of Clinton \n21  and other precedent, so long as a waiver does not leave a statutory provision with no \n22  legal effect, there is no plausible claim for a legislative repeal in violation of the \n23  Presentment Clauses.”  Defs.’ Br. at 61 n.49 (citing Acree, 370 F.3d at 64 n.3; \n24 \n                                           \n25  current Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent. \n26  24 Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the waiver authority here from other waiver statutes \nby the scope of the waiver or the availability of judicial review, see Ctr. Br. at 33-34; \n27 \nCal. Br. at 39; but they do not purport to canvas all other waiver statutes enacted by \n28  Congress and cannot show that any court found such distinctions relevant.   \n  28 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1406   Page 41 of 49\n \n1  Telecomm.

The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Constitutional Provisions \nRegarding Access to the Courts \n4 \nDHS has shown that each of Plaintiffs’ three arguments about access to the \n5 \ncourts or due process fail to establish any constitutional violation here.  See Defs.’ Br. \n6 \nat 65-70.  First, Plaintiffs ask the Court to conclude that the “right of access to the \n7 \ncourts”—based in the First Amendment right to “petition for redress of grievances” \n8 \n(the “Petition Clause”)—acts as a limit on Congress’s authority to limit the \n9 \njurisdiction of the lower courts.  DHS has shown that the Petition Clause protects \n10 \nagainst obstructions to available administrative or judicial proceedings.  See, e.g., \n11 \nRinggold-Lockhart v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 761 F.3d 1057, 1061-62 (9th Cir. 2014); \n12 \nMunguia v. Frias, No. 07-1016, 2009 WL 3157482, at *12 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2009).  \n13 \nIt would be entirely novel to apply it to the creation of administrative or judicial \n14 \njurisdiction in the first place.  See Defs.’ Br. at 66-67.  Nor do Plaintiffs explain how \n15 \nsuch a notion could be reconciled to Congress’s well-established authority to limit the \n16 \njurisdiction of the lower federal courts.  As DHS noted, while there is no binding \n17 \nprecedent on this issue, the closest cases show that Plaintiffs’ proposal must be \n18 \nrejected.  See, e.g., Roller v. Gunn, 107 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1997) (“[T]he right of \n19 \naccess to federal courts . . . is subject to Congress’ Article III power to set limits on \n20 \nfederal jurisdiction.”);25 Wilbur v. Locke, 423 F.3d 1101, 1116 (9th Cir. 2005), \n21 \nabrogated on other grounds, Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413 (2010) \n22 \n(right of access “is not absolute” and “must be exercised within the limits of the \n23 \ncourts’ prescribed procedures”).26 \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n25 Plaintiffs claim that Roller is irrelevant because it did not mention the Petition \n26  Clause.  Cal. Reply at 17 n.16.  But its observations are relevant because the Ninth \nCircuit has explained that “right of access” caselaw is rooted in numerous overlapping \n27 \nconstitutional provisions.  See Ringgold-Lockhart, 761 F.3d at 1061-62. \n28 \n26 The Supreme Court abrogated Wilber on the threshold question of comity for state \n  29 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1407   Page 42 of 49\n \n1  Second, Plaintiffs argue that Congress cannot “eliminate concurrent state court \n2  jurisdiction” without providing a federal forum for that claim to be heard.  Coal. Reply \n3  at 19.  But as DHS has shown, there is no support for that notion and Plaintiffs’ claim \n4  is undermined by the primary case on which they rely.  See Defs. Br. at 68.  \n5  Concurrent state court jurisdiction “depends altogether upon the pleasure of Congress, \n6  and may be revoked and extinguished whenever they think proper, in every case in \n7  which the subject-matter can constitutionally be made cognizable in the Federal \n8  courts.”  Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, 747 (2009) (Thomas, J., dissenting) \n9  (quoting Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, 170 U.S. 511, 517-18 (1898)) \n10  (emphasis added).  Here, Congress has expressly made federal jurisdiction exclusive \n11  for challenges to the waiver determinations, which is plainly a matter cognizable in \n12  federal court.  See IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A).  And to the extent Plaintiffs are referring to \n13  the waived state laws, DHS limited its waivers to those for which the subject-matter \n14  can be made cognizable in federal court.  See, e.g., 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (waiving \n15  “state . . . laws, regulations, and legal requirements of, deriving from, or related to the \n16  subject of, the following [federal] statutes”). \n17  Third, Plaintiffs claim that the challenged waiver determinations fail to provide \n18  adequate notice in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  DHS \n19  has shown that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden to establish a cognizable \n20  life, liberty, or property interest for which due process is required.  See Defs.’ Br. at \n21  69; Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005).  On reply, only California \n22  addresses this issue, claiming an “interest in the enforcement of its state laws” and \n23  “preservation of [state] property . . . adjacent to the” projects.  Cal. Reply at 17 (citing \n24  Cal. Br. at 13).  These terse assertions from California’s discussion of its \n25  constitutional standing do not carry its burden.  California provides no support for the \n26 \n                                           \n27 \ncourt jurisdiction and did not address Wilber’s treatment of the merits argument about \n28  “right of access.”  See Levin, 560 U.S. at 417, 420; Wilbur, 423 F.3d at 1110, 1115-16. \n  30 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1408   Page 43 of 49\n \n1  notion that its parochial enforcement interest is cognizable under the Fifth \n2  Amendment, and it has not shown any deprivation of its property interests stemming \n3  from the waivers.  See Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Stmt. of Facts at 23, ECF No. 35-3.27   \n4  Moreover, California cannot show that the waiver determinations fail to provide \n5  sufficient notice of the waiver of state law.  Because state law that can bind federal \n6  action is vanishingly rare, the set of laws that would otherwise be enforceable is quite \n7  limited and it should not be difficult to determine whether such a law is “related to” \n8  one of the waived federal statutes.28  As California obliquely acknowledged, the \n9  statutes primarily affected are those related to environmental “permitting authority.”  \n10  See Cal. Reply at 3 n.3; see also Cal. Compl. ¶¶ 38-39, 112-15.  Any lingering \n11  uncertainty would not harm California because it could initiate an enforcement action, \n12  whereupon the enforceability of the provision could be tested in court.29  Nor does \n13  California lack sufficient notice of the project areas or construction projects.  DHS has \n14  clarified that the two projects specified in the San Diego waiver determination are the \n15  only projects DHS will complete pursuant to that notice.  See Defs.’ Br. at 70; Defs.’ \n16  Resp. to Stmt. of Facts at 34-35.30 \n17 \n                                           \n18  27 California also claims that its “void-for-vagueness challenge” can proceed \nindependently from the Due Process Clause, citing a case stating that an \n19 \nunconstitutionally vague law can violate the Free Speech Clause.  See Cal. Reply at 17 \n20  (citing O’Brien v. Welty, 818 F.3d 920, 930 (9th Cir. 2016)).  While Welby used “First \nAmendment” as shorthand for the Free Speech Clause, Plaintiffs cannot show that the \n21 \nunderlying rationales, such as chilling speech or being unaware that one’s behavior \n22  could be punished, 818 F.3d at 930, would equally apply to the Petition Clause.  \n23  28 As for California’s claim that “courts routinely apply California law to federal \nconstruction projects,” Cal. Reply at 17, its only example involves state contract law, \n24 \nwhich is undoubtedly unaffected by the waiver determinations.  See Harper/Nielsen-\n25  Dillingham, Builders, Inc. v. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 667, 679 (2008). \n26  29 Thus California’s interest differs significantly from an individual who lacks \nknowledge of “what is permissible and what is forbidden.”  Cal.

The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate the Tenth Amendment \n2  California has no viable claim that Congress violated the Tenth Amendment by \n3  permitting the waiver of state laws that impede expeditious construction of border \n4  infrastructure.  It is not an intrusion on state sovereignty to preempt state laws for \n5  purposes of a federal construction project within Congress’s express authority. \n6  DHS has shown that the waiver of state law—whether by statute or by \n7  regulation—is simply a limited form of federal preemption.  See Defs.’ Br. at 71.  \n8  Ninth Circuit law is clear that in general, “if Congress acts under one of its \n9  enumerated powers, there can be no violation of the Tenth Amendment.”  United \n10  States v. Jones, 231 F.3d 508, 515 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Gila River Indian \n11  Community v. United States, 729 F.3d 1139, 1153 (9th Cir. 2013).  And California \n12  does not dispute DHS’s showing that Ninth Circuit caselaw is also clear that the \n13  power to preempt state laws that conflict with or serve as an obstacle to the purposes \n14  of federal law does not “intrude on the rights reserved under the Tenth Amendment.”  \n15  S. Cal. Edison Co. v. Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 808 (9th Cir. 2002); see also United States \n16  v. Geiger, 263 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 2001).31  California likewise does not dispute \n17  DHS’s showing that the state’s police power claims are not enough to raise a viable \n18  Tenth Amendment claim because “[g]enerally speaking, . . . a power granted to \n19  Congress trumps a competing claim based on a state’s police power.”  Gonzalez v. \n20 \n                                           \n21  not impermissibly vague for the San Diego notice to reference “various border \ninfrastructure projects” and then identify the two that will be constructed.  See 82 Fed. \n22 \nReg. at 35984-85.  California’s concern that the waiver would be used for other \n23  projects has been addressed.  DHS has no need to include subsequently selected \nprojects within this notice because it can simply issue another notice. \n24 \n31 Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82 (1985), cited by California, does not imply that a \n25 \nstate has sovereign rights against federal preemption.  That case merely applied “the \n26  dual sovereignty doctrine” of the Double Jeopardy Clause “to successive prosecutions \nby two States.”  Id. at 83.  It concluded that the Constitution does not “deny a State its \n27 \npower to enforce its criminal laws because another State has won the race to the \n28  courthouse.”  Id. at 93. \n  32 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1410   Page 45 of 49\n \n1  Raich, 500 F.3d 850, 867 (9th Cir. 2007).  Nor does California dispute that regulation \n2  of the border and providing for the enforcement of federal law are quintessentially \n3  within Congress’ inherent and enumerated powers.  See Cal. Reply at 15. \n4  Instead, California claims the Supreme Court has “rejected the same cramped \n5  interpretation of the Tenth Amendment that Defendants advance here.”  Cal. Reply at \n6  13.  But Defendants have merely cited controlling Ninth Circuit law.  Accordingly, \n7  California’s claim that Supreme Court cases from the 1990s undermine more recent \n8  Ninth Circuit decisions is not persuasive.  See Cal. Reply at 13-14 (citing New York v. \n9  United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997)).  \n10  California simply cannot show, in light of the Ninth Circuit caselaw discussed above, \n11  that the limited preemption that Congress permitted in § 102(c)(1) does not implicate \n12  the States’ “inviolable sovereignty.”  New York, 505 U.S. at 188.  This limited \n13  preemption is a far cry from the commandeering at issue in New York and Printz.  See \n14  New York, 505 U.S. at 188 (“Whatever the outer limits of that sovereignty may be, \n15  one thing is clear: The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or \n16  administer a federal regulatory program.”); Printz, 521 U.S. at 935 (“Congress cannot \n17  . . . conscript[] the State's officers directly.”).  In no way does the preemption of \n18  various state environmental laws that might have been applicable to these federal \n19  construction projects along the border implicate the “essential attribute of the States' \n20  retained sovereignty that they remain independent and autonomous within their proper \n21  sphere of authority.”  Printz, 521 U.S. at 928. \n22  California’s reliance on Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013) is \n23  entirely misplaced.32  At bottom, that case simply held that “[t]o serve [the Fifteenth \n24 \n                                           \n32 While California initially made an “alternative” argument based on City of Boerne \n25 \nv. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), Cal. Br. at 27-28, on reply it defends this argument \n26 \nonly in a footnote.  See Cal. Reply at 16 n.14.  As DHS explained, Boerne does not \nstand for the broad principle California suggests.  See Defs.’ Br. at 73-74.

Ct. at 2629.  When courts are “assessing . . . disparate treatment \n4  of States,” it must do so in light of the “highly pertinent” and “fundamental principle \n5  of equal sovereignty.”  Id.  Shelby County has no application here for several reasons.  \n6  First, the limited preemption of state law, as discussed above, is not an intrusion on \n7  state sovereignty, and thus does not implicate equal sovereignty.  See Defs.’ Br. at 72.  \n8  Unlike the Voting Rights Act requirement that certain states get “federal permission \n9  before enacting any law related to voting,” 133 S. Ct. at 2618, States remain free to \n10  enact and implement any state law—the preempted enforcement of state law for the \n11  federal construction projects is no impairment of retained sovereignty.  Second, \n12  Congress did not distinguish between any states in § 102, and no court has suggested \n13  that a disparate impact on certain states raises the same concerns as disparate \n14  treatment.  See id. at 2619, 2624, 2630 (repeatedly referencing “disparate treatment”).  \n15  Third, even if disparate impact is relevant, an impact on the states adjoining the U.S. \n16  international border remains a “basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.”  \n17  Id. at 2629.  As DHS has explained, it is irrelevant that illegal entries have declined \n18  since 2005, because Congress is always free to preempt state law that impedes its \n19  inherent and enumerated powers regarding border and immigration control.  See \n20  Defs.’ Br. at 73; County of El Paso, No. 08-196, 2008 WL 4372693, at *8 (“The \n21  Secretary, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, has only waived state and local laws \n22  which interfere with Congress’s purpose to construct the border barrier.”). \n23 \n                                           \n24  violation of [constitutional] rights.”  Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 518 (2004).  \nCalifornia protests that Boerne “never mentions” sovereign immunity, Cal. Reply at \n25 \n16 n.14, but this context is key because Boerne turned on the disconnect between the \n26  Religious Freedom Reformation Act and § 5’s remedial purpose.  See 521 U.S. at 532.  \nAs DHS explained, that analysis has no application here because preemption is unlike \n27 \nabrogating state immunity and Congress here is free to enact substantive law, rather \n28  than being limited to remedial action.  See Defs.’ Br. at 73-74. \n  34 \nDefs.’ Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \nJudgment \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 42   Filed 01/23/18   PageID.1412   Page 47 of 49\n \n1  For all of these reasons, Shelby County cannot be generalized into the \n2  proposition that “a validly enacted federal statute that burdens a subset of states but \n3  not others will become unconstitutional if progress is made curbing the problem the \n4  statute seeks to prevent.”  Cal. Reply at 14 (quoting Cal. Br. at 25).  “Making \n5  progress” would be an utterly untenable standard to apply.  In addition, the Supreme \n6  Court did not suggest that “making progress” alone renders a law unconstitutional, but \n7  far more narrowly held that any distinction between states must be on a “basis that \n8  makes sense in light of current conditions.”  133 S. Ct. at 2629.  To whatever extent § \n9  102(c)(2)(A) can be characterized as distinguishing between states, the basis for that \n10  distinction makes just as much sense today as it did in 2005. \n11  V.  PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER OTHER \nSTATUTES OR TO THE REMEDIES THEY SEEK FOR THEIR \n12  CONSTITUTIONAL AND ULTRA VIRES CLAIMS \n13 \nDefendants have shown that they are entitled to summary judgment and that \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ motions should be denied.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that their statutory \n15 \nclaims under NEPA, ESA, and CZMA regarding the projects specified in the 2017 \n16 \nwaivers must be dismissed if the waivers are upheld.  See, e.g., Cal. Reply at 4.  And \n17 \nas discussed above, the Coalition Plaintiffs’ APA claims must be rejected for lack of \n18 \njurisdiction.  See supra, Arg. § II(A).  Accordingly, those claims must be dismissed. \n19 \nCalifornia claims that it has caught DHS on a technical failure to dispute its \n20 \noverbroad NEPA claim, and therefore that it is entitled to summary judgment as to the \n21 \n“planning of infrastructure projects that fall outside the scope of any waiver.”  Cal. \n22 \nReply at 3.  DHS did not understand California to be pressing claims regarding \n23 \ninfrastructure projects “along the entire 2000-mile southern border.”  Cal.

See supra, Arg. § I.  Nor has \n2  California established that any such planning rises to the level of any concrete \n3  proposals that would trigger a NEPA obligation or for which DHS could consider \n4  whether any additional waivers would be appropriate.  See, e.g., Northcoast Envtl. \n5  Ctr. v. Glickman, 136 F.3d 660, 670 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that NEPA obligations \n6  were not triggered until a federal agency proposed site-specific activities calling for \n7  “specific actions directly impacting the physical environment”).  This also means \n8  there has been no final agency action under the APA upon which to base such a NEPA \n9  claim.  See id. at 668-69 (noting that NEPA challenges to “broad ill-defined [federal \n10  agency] programs that do not cause concrete effects” were not ripe for judicial review \n11  under the APA “final agency action” requirement until the agency approved “concrete \n12  actions” affecting the environment).  Similarly, because California has not shown that \n13  the possibility of later replacing secondary fencing in the San Diego Sector has risen \n14  to the level of an “activity” for purposes of the CZMA, 16 U.S.C. § 1446; Sec'y of the \n15  Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 (1984), or final agency action under the \n16  APA, Plaintiffs cannot press any claims regarding that potential project here.  See \n17  Akiak Native Cmty. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 213 F.3d 1140, 1144 (9th Cir. 2000); George \n18  v. Evans, 311 F.

For all of these reasons, California cannot receive summary judgment for \n22  DHS activities outside the scope of the 2017 waiver determinations.  \n23  Finally, Plaintiffs have not disputed Defendants’ request that, if the Court rules \n24  for Plaintiffs, Defendants be provided the opportunity to provide separate briefing on \n25  remedy.

That Act, and a series of subsequent Acts in 2005, \n5  2006, and 2008, required the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to take such \n6  actions as necessary “to gain operational control of the southwest border” including by \n7  completing priority barriers by the end of 2008. See IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A).1  \n8  These Acts envisioned that portions of the southwest border would be secured by \n9  physical barriers. Congress in fact mandated certain specific barriers be constructed to \n10  shut down known smuggling corridors. Yet in 2005, after nearly a decade of delay \n11  completing “the last piece of fence” in an area near San Diego, Congress granted \n12  extraordinary power to the Secretary of DHS to waive an unlimited number of federal, \n13  state, and local laws to finally complete the job mandated in 1996. The proponents of the \n14  2005 amendment repeatedly discussed the Secretary’s extraordinary waiver authority in \n15  the context of ensuring the completion of this very specific portion of fencing.  \n16  Now, after nearly a decade without any further Congressional action regarding \n17  section 102, the Defendants2 have dusted off section 102(c) and invoked the \n18  extraordinary waiver power to build “replacement” barriers and prototypes that will not \n19  yield any additional fencing. These projects are not actual attempts to “deter illegal \n20 \n21 \n                                         \n22 \n1 The law at issue here is “section 102” of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n23 \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 \n24  (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note), as amended by REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. \n109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 306, as amended by Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. \n25 \n109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638, as amended by Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, \n26  Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V, § 564(a), 121 Stat. 2090-91 (2007). \n2 Defendants Department of Homeland Security, Acting Secretary Elaine Duke, and the \n27 \nUnited States of America (collectively, “Defendants” or “Government”) \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 1 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.653   Page 9 of 38\n \n1  crossings” or secure the border as required by section 102, a conclusion supported by \n2  undisputed facts as the Coalition Plaintiffs3 demonstrate below.  \n3  As a result, the waivers are invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under \n4  section 102, the Secretary only has authority to construct “additional barriers” that will \n5  “deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry,” a requirement that it not captured \n6  by the waiver provision. Yet the projects at issue here will neither deter illegal crossings \n7  nor be constructed in areas of high illegal entry. \n8  Even if this Court adopted the Governments’ interpretation of the scope of the \n9  Secretary’s waiver authority, and held she could waive compliance with a challenge to \n10  the very requirements contained in Section 102 itself, that would not displace this Court’s \n11  inherent ultra vires authority. The waivers here are ultra vires for the same reasons they \n12  cannot withstand scrutiny under the APA as well as those discussed below.  \n13  The Government’s attempt to invoke section 102 authority for these projects also \n14  confirms the concerns raised in litigation a decade ago. The waivers here demonstrate the \n15  Government has interpreted section 102 in a manner that results in an impermissibly \n16  broad and vague delegation of authority that cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. In \n17  2005, a court in this district upheld section 102 against a non-delegation challenge \n18  because it interpreted subsection 102(c)’s waiver authority as limited to the project near \n19  San Diego mandated by the 1996 legislation. Yet, contrary to the decision in that case, \n20  the Government now seeks to extend this waiver authority to any border project, thereby \n21  resulting in section 102 violating the non-delegation doctrine. \n22  Similarly, the waiver authority violates the Constitution’s Presentment Clause by, \n23  “[i]n both legal and practical effect,” authorizing the Secretary of the DHS to repeal acts \n24  of Congress in her sole discretion. Since it must retain the authority to repeal legislation, \n25  Congress is constrained from vesting that power in the Secretary. \n                                         \n26 \n3 Plaintiffs Defenders of Wildlife, Animal Legal Defense Fund, and Sierra Club \n27 \n(collectively, “Coalition Plaintiffs” or “Plaintiffs”). \n28 \nMEM.

Under this interpretation, no court has the authority to determine whether the \n4  Secretary has exceeded her statutory authority. This reading of the law is contrary to \n5  Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court ultra vires review precedent. Furthermore, if such \n6  reading is accepted, it would confirm Congress’s unconstitutional overextension of power \n7  in Subsection 102(c)(2) by insulating congressional as well Secretarial action from \n8  judicial scrutiny in violation of Article III and bedrock principles of separation of powers \n9  and federalism. \n10  Consequently, Defendants’ conduct here is unauthorized, unconstitutional, and \n11  void, and this Court is within its judicial authority to declare precisely that and invalidate \n12  the waivers at issue here by granting the Coalition Plaintiffs summary judgment. \n13  LEGAL STANDARDS \n14  “Summary judgment is appropriate if the ‘pleadings, depositions, answers to \n15  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \n16  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to \n17  judgment as a matter of law.’” Wheeler v.

THE SECRETARIES’ DETERMINATIONS THAT THE PROJECTS ARE IN “AREAS OF \nHIGH ILLEGAL ENTRY” AND TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECTS WITHOUT \n3 \nSATISFYING THE CONSULTATION REQUIREMENT VIOLATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE \n4  PROCEDURE ACT. \n5  Prior to utilizing the waiver authority in section 102(c) of IIRIRA, the Secretary \n6  must (1) determine that additional physical barriers are “necessary” to deter illegal \n7  crossings in “areas of high illegal entry,” and (2) “consult” with the Secretaries of Interior \n8  and Agriculture, and States, among others, “to minimize the impact on the environment, \n9  culture, commerce, and quality of life…” IIRIRA § 102(a), (b). Judicial review of the \n10  Secretary’s decisions pursuant to these subsections is governed by the APA, under which \n11  the Court must decide whether the decisions were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n12  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). As discussed \n13  below, Secretaries Duke and Kelly issued the San Diego and Calexico waivers without \n14  complying with these prerequisites in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \n15  U.S.C. § 500 et seq. \n16  A.   The Secretary’s actions required by subsections (a) and (b) of section \n  102 of IIRIRA are reviewable under the APA. \n17 \nThe Supreme Court has “repeatedly” acknowledged “the strong presumption that \n18 \nCongress intends judicial review of administrative action.” Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. \n19 \n535, 542 (1988) (providing examples) (quoting Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family \n20 \nPhysicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986)). “Indeed, judicial review of [] administrative \n21 \naction is the rule, and nonreviewability an exception which must be demonstrated… [by] \n22 \n‘clear and convincing evidence’” Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 166-67 (1970) \n23 \n(citation omitted). “This presumption is overcome only in two narrow circumstances. The \n24 \nfirst … is when Congress expressly bars review by statute… The second applies in ‘those \n25 \nrare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is \n26 \nno law to apply.’” Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v.

MCorp Fin., \n2  Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 44 (1991)) (quoting Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 599 (1988)). \n3  The Supreme Court has “consistently applied this interpretive guide to legislation \n4  regarding immigration, and particularly to questions concerning the preservation of \n5  federal-court jurisdiction.” Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 235 (2010). “The default \n6  rule [] that agency actions are reviewable. … applies in the post-IIRIRA immigration \n7  context.” ANA Int’l, Inc. v. Way, 393 F.3d 886, 890 (9th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). \n8  Recognizing the importance of preserving judicial review, “lower courts have … read the \n9  jurisdiction-removing statutes of IIRIRA narrowly (and Supreme Court precedents \n10  broadly) …” Maldonado v. Fasano, 67 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1182 n.13 (S.D. Cal. 1999). \n11  Courts have further found that Congress made “specific reference” within IIRIRA when \n12  it intended to “amend or repeal statutes granting jurisdiction to the federal courts.” United \n13  States v. Arce-Hernandez, 163 F.3d 559, 563 (9th Cir. 1998). \n14  The waiver authority and jurisdictional limitation in subsection 102(c) has no \n15  bearing on judicial review of subsections 102(a) and (b). Starting with “the language of \n16  the statute itself,” Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, \n17  108 (1980), the pertinent text of the waiver provides: “Notwithstanding any other \n18  provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to waive all \n19  legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, determines \n20  necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.” \n21  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) (emphasis added). “The ordinary meaning of ‘notwithstanding’ is ‘in \n22  spite of,’ or ‘without prevention or obstruction from or by,’” NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 137 \n23  S. Ct. 929, 939 (2017) (citations omitted), and “other” commonly means “being the one \n24  or ones distinct from that or those first mentioned or implied.” Merriam-Webster, \n25  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/other (“not the same”).  \n26  The Ninth Circuit has determined the “reach” of the phrase “notwithstanding” by \n27  “taking into account the whole of the statutory context in which it appears.” Consejo de \n28  Desarrollo Economico de Mexicali, A.C. v. United States, 482 F.3d 1157, 1168 (9th Cir. \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 5 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.657   Page 13 of 38\n \n1  2007) (citation omitted). Under this view, the phrase “notwithstanding” demonstrates an \n2  intent to limit the waiver authority solely to laws other than the one in which the waiver \n3  is contained, meaning the requirements of the section itself are not waivable. See, e.g., \n4  United States v. Dahl, 314 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir. 2002) (“notwithstanding any other \n5  provision of law” read “to mean just what it says”); Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Grp., 508 \n6  U.S. 10 (1993) (phrase interpreted as “to supersede all other laws” (emphasis added)); \n7  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1083 (9th Cir. 2014) (such clauses \n8  “nullify conflicting provisions of law.” (emphasis in original)). \n9  The court in United States v. Arizona also indicated that some DHS actions under \n10  section 102 “are reviewable under § 706(2)(A).” United States v. State of Arizona, No. \n11  2:10-cv-1413-SRB, 2011 WL 13137062, at *8-*9 (D. Ariz. Oct. 21, 2011) (but \n12  dismissing claims due to “ongoing, non-final actions” and finding § 102(b) did “not \n13  mandate any discrete agency action”). Similarly, the Congressional Research Service has \n14  also indicated that APA review is available for subsection 102(b). Michael John Garcia, \n15  Cong. Research Serv., R43975, Barriers Along the U.S. Borders: Key Authorities and \n16  Requirements 16 (2017) (“Secretary’s determination not to place fencing at a location \n17  would be afforded a very high degree of deference by a reviewing court” and “the \n18  ‘notwithstanding’ clause enables DHS to readily answer claims by parties seeking to \n19  compel some portion of the required border fencing at a [specific] location”). \n20  The “high illegal entry” and consultation requirements of subsections 102(a) and \n21  (b) are, in fact, conditions that must be satisfied before Secretary can invoke the \n22  subsection 102(c) authority. Unless the barriers’ purpose is to control access in “areas of \n23  high illegal entry” and the Secretary has consulted with the parties identified in \n24  subsection 102(b)(1)(C), the waiver is unavailable. Accordingly, the conditions in \n25  subsections 101(a) and (b) must be given effect. See, e.g., Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n26  821, 829 (1985) (“statute generally should be read “to give effect, if possible, to every \n27  clause…’” (citation omitted); Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009) (“statute \n28  should be construed … so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

L. No. 110-161 Div. E § 564 \n5  (2007), further supports construing subsection (c) as extraneous to the remaining \n6  subsections 102(a) and (b). It would be absurd for Congress to adopt a requirement upon \n7  the Secretary and, simultaneously, grant the Secretary authority to waive that very \n8  requirement in the same amendment. See Markham v. Cabell, 326 U.S. 404, 411 (1945) \n9  (“the normal assumption is that where Congress amends only one section of a law, \n10  leaving another untouched, the two were designed to function as parts of an integrated \n11  whole.”). This is particularly so as the consultation requirement addresses environmental \n12  issues that would otherwise be subject to laws Congress had originally envisioned as \n13  waivable by the Secretary.  \n14  This restrained reading of subsection 102(c)’s influence is also consistent with the \n15  congressional intent for the waiver: allowing the Secretary to disregard laws that may \n16  hinder “expeditious construction” of border infrastructure – e.g., NEPA and the ESA. \n17  Determining locations to be areas of high illegal entry and consulting with affect parties, \n18  however, are directed to project location and design, rather than potentially time-\n19  consuming permitting and procedural compliance. See Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, \n20  Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 575 (1982) (“absurd results are to be avoided if alternative \n21  interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.”). \n22  Judicial review of subsections 102(a) and (b) would also not endanger the general \n23  purpose of section 102. “Congress intends the executive to obey its statutory commands \n24  and, accordingly, that it expects the courts to grant relief when an executive agency \n25  violates such a command.” Bowen, 476 U.S. at 681. If Congress intended to shield the \n26  Secretary’s determinations regarding necessity and “areas of high illegal entry” from \n27  review, including such prerequisites in subsection (a) would have been unnecessary. See \n28  Sharp Healthcare v. Leavitt, 555 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1125 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (argument \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 7 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.659   Page 15 of 38\n \n1  against review implied agency “may disregard Congress’s express statutory command.”). \n2  Since it does not endanger the general purposes of section 102, judicial review of the \n3  Secretary’s actions are appropriate. See Cnty. of Esmeralda v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 925 \n4  F.2d 1216, 1218-19 (9th Cir. 1991) (statute making determinations “at the discretion of \n5  the Secretary” not “endangered by judicial review”). \n6  B.  The Secretary’s decisions required by subsections 102(a) and (b) of \nIIRIRA are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n7 \nnot in accordance with law. \n8 \nOn August 2, 2017, former DHS Secretary Kelly “determined” that the San Diego \n9 \nSector “remains an area of high illegal entry.” Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of \n10 \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, \n11 \n82 Fed. Reg. 35,984, 35,984 (Aug. 2, 2017). Similarly, on September 17, 2017, Secretary \n12 \nDuke also “determined” that the “Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector is an area of high \n13 \nillegal entry.” Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n14 \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829, 42,830 \n15 \n(Sept. 12, 2017). Combined, the Secretaries provided five sentences of “support” for \n16 \nthese determinations. The Secretaries’ “areas of high illegal entry” determinations \n17 \npursuant to subsection 102(a), however, are contradicted by DHS data concerning the \n18 \namount of illegal entry, Border Patrol’s effectiveness, and practices. \n19 \nAs DHS reported in September 2017, “With respect to border enforcement outputs, \n20 \navailable data indicate that the southwest land border is more difficult to illegally cross \n21 \ntoday than ever before.” Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Plaintiffs \n22 \nDefenders of Wildlife, Animal Legal Defense Fund, and Sierra Club’s Motion for \n23 \nSummary Judgment ¶ 13 (hereinafter “Pls.’ Stmt.”). The number of apprehensions \n24 \n“serves as a long-standing proxy measure of illegal flows.” Id. ¶ 15. Throughout the \n25 \nSouthwest Border, Border Patrol made 408,870 apprehensions in 2016, a 75 percent drop \n26 \nfrom 1.64 million in 2000. Id. ¶¶ 13, 16. Over this same period, apprehensions decreased \n27 \nby 79 percent in the San Diego Sector and 92 percent in the El Centro Sector. Id. ¶¶ 17-\n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

When IIRIRA was first passed in 1996, the San Diego Sector’s 483,815 \n2  apprehensions accounted for 32 percent of all Border Patrol apprehensions along the \n3  Southwest border, but, by 2016, less than 8 percent of apprehensions occurred in this \n4  sector. Id. ¶ 18.  \n5  The decrease in illegal migration has been more dramatic during since the Trump \n6  Administration has been in office. During the period from when this Administration \n7  began to the time when Secretary Kelly issued the San Diego Waiver (February through \n8  July 2017), the available data demonstrates a drop in apprehensions by more than 60 \n9  percent from the same period in 2016 along the Southwest Border, as well as 51 percent \n10  in the San Diego Sector and 28 percent in the El Centro Sector. Id.  \n11  In addition to the decrease in apprehensions, Border Patrol has also increased its \n12  interdiction effectiveness between points of entry on the Southwest border every year it \n13  has been reported by DHS, from 79.3 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 82.7 percent in 2016. \n14  Id. ¶ 22. The San Diego and El Centro Sectors also have had better apprehension rates \n15  than any other southwestern sector. Id. ¶ 35. \n16  Similar to the performance measures, the allocation of Border Patrols’ resources \n17  does not support the “areas of high illegal entry” conclusions. Border Patrol “resources \n18  are deployed to those areas deemed to be the highest risk.” Id. ¶ 27 (“Border Patrol uses \n19  … data, to assign risk scores to each sector, which informs resource deployments.”). In \n20  2016, there were more than three times the number of Border Patrol agents in the \n21  Southwest Border Sectors than there were in 1996. Id. ¶ 26. Although the number of \n22  agents along the Southwest border was 8.6 percent lower in 2016 than the peak in 2013, \n23  agents deployed in the San Diego and El Centro Sectors dropped by 19 and 10 percent, \n24  respectively, over the last three full fiscal years. Id. ¶¶ 29-31. Also, twenty years ago, \n25  agents in the San Diego sector accounted for 27 percent of all Border Patrol agents in the \n26  Southwestern border, which dropped to 12 percent by 2016.

DHS has already spent more than $2 billion to install 705 miles of fencing \n6  along the border. Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 33. “Despite these investments, CBP cannot measure the \n7  contribution of fencing to border security operations along the southwest border because \n8  it has not developed metrics for this assessment.” Id. The existing data does nonetheless \n9  suggest that barriers may not be the most effective means of preventing illegal \n10  immigration. From 2013 through 2015, for example, the San Diego Sector “had the \n11  highest estimated apprehension rate in the sector (77 percent) in zones with no fencing.” \n12  Id. ¶ 35. The El Centro Sector’s apprehension rate was 70 percent in in areas with no \n13  fencing, which is above the total rate of 67 percent throughout the sector. Id. \n14  In addition to these determinations required by subsection 102(a), the Secretary has \n15  a nondiscretionary duty to “consult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n16  Agriculture, States, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners” under \n17  subparagraph 102(b)(1)(C). Though not defined in section 102, “consultation” in \n18  common use means “[t]he act of asking the advice or opinion of someone…, or “[a] \n19  meeting in which parties consult or confer.” Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). \n20  “Consultation implies an exchange of views or a request for advice… Consulting with \n21  others supplements the information an individual has in order to reach a final judgment.” \n22  Piscione v. Ernst & Young, L.L.P., 171 F.3d 527, 536-37 (7th Cir.1999), overruled on \n23  other grounds by Hill v. Tangherlini, 724 F.3d 965 (7th Cir. 2013). “An ordinary \n24  meaning of the word consult is to ‘seek information or advice from (someone with \n25  expertise in a particular area)’ or to ‘have discussions or confer with (someone), typically \n26  before undertaking a course of action.’” California Wilderness Coal. v.

See Doc. \n3  #18-2 (Ex. 14). Although the Secretary had already determined it necessary to waive \n4  thirty-seven statutes on August 2, 2017, CBP did not have “[f]ield surveys for natural and \n5  cultural resources … conducted [until] August 23, 2017.” Doc. #18-2 (Ex. 14), \n6  PageID.425. The environmental analysis, moreover, was also “[b]ased on the results of \n7  the field surveys and [CBP’s] knowledge of the Project Area,” without any input from \n8  other parties. Id. at PageID.427. This process is also inconsistent with DHS practices in \n9  previous use of waivers. Under the waivers issued between 2008 and 2011, “[p]rior to \n10  fence construction, CBP prepared Environmental Stewardship Plans (ESPs) that \n11  summarized the natural and cultural resource surveys conducted during fence planning \n12  and estimated the potential environmental impacts based on the initial fence design.” Pls.’ \n13  Stmt. at ¶ 38. The ESPs were also made available to the public on the CBP website. Id. \n14  Prior to preparing the ESP, in some instances, CBP “prepared a Biological Resources \n15  Plan (BRP) to identify the presence of sensitive biological resources … and potential \n16  impacts on these resources … provided the BRP to affected resource agencies and land \n17  managers for review. The BRP was [then] appended to the [ESP].” Id. ¶ 39.

U.S. Sec’y of Labor, 841 F.2d 278, 281 (9th Cir. 1988) \n9 \n(“Even where the statutory provision absolutely bars judicial review, . . . jurisdiction \n10 \nexists where defendant is charged with violating a clear statutory mandate or \n11 \nprohibition”). As the Ninth Circuit explained, a statute that seeks to preclude judicial \n12 \nreview cannot remove a Court’s inherent ultra vires review authority because the \n13 \nConstitution mandates that an aggrieved party have “a meaningful and adequate \n14 \nopportunity for judicial review of the regulation that he argue[s] was promulgated in \n15 \nexcess of the agency’s statutory authority.” Bozarov, 974 F.2d at 1045, n.8 (explaining \n16 \nMCorp. Financial, 502 U.S. 32). Where a statute itself fails to provide such an avenue of \n17 \n“meaningful and adequate” judicial review, the Court’s inherent ultra vires authority fills \n18 \nthat gap. Id. (following Dart, 848 F.2d at 222 (same principle)); see also Spencer \n19 \nEnterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that \n20 \neven if different provisions of IIRIRA that preclude all review of certain decisions \n21 \napplied, “the courts retain jurisdiction to review whether a particular decision is ultra \n22 \nvires [as to] the statute in question”). Thus, subsection 102(c)(2)’s jurisdictional stripping \n23 \nprovision cannot eliminate this Court’s inherent ultra vires jurisdiction. \n24 \n \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

The waivers are ultra vires because they fall outside the statutory scope \nof authority Congress granted to the Secretary. \n2 \nThe Secretary’s waivers here go far beyond those that were the subject of prior \n3 \nlitigation and are ultra vires for several reasons. In prior waiver cases,5 courts upheld the \n4 \nconstitutionality of section 102 because the specific projects at issue squarely fell within \n5 \nthe limited scope of those intended by Congress, i.e., projects specifically mandated by \n6 \nsubsection 102(b). Here, the waivers do not relate to the construction of any “additional \n7 \nbarriers,” much less mandated ones, and instead involve replacement of fencing and a \n8 \nprototype construction project to allow for the evaluation of future barrier designs. \n9 \nIn upholding those prior waivers, the courts held that section 102’s waiver \n10 \nauthority was subject to several boundaries, including the requirement that waiver must \n11 \nbe “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of “additional physical barriers and \n12 \nroads . . . to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry.” Defenders of Wildlife v. \n13 \nChertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 127 (D.D.C. 2007) (emphasis added) (quoting § 102). The \n14 \nDefenders of Wildlife court, though acknowledging it was unprecedented in theoretical \n15 \nbreadth as to the substantive laws that could be waived, concluded the section 102 waiver \n16 \nauthority was indeed limited because “the Secretary may only exercise the waiver \n17 \nauthority for the ‘narrow purpose’ prescribed by Congress: ‘expeditious completion’ of \n18 \nthe border fences authorized by IIRIRA in areas of high illegal entry.” Id. at 128 \n19 \n(emphases added) (quoting Sierra Club v.

LEXIS 44244 (emphasis added). \n3  1.  The Secretary’s use of section 102(c) waivers to “replace existing \nprimary fencing” are ultra vires. \n4 \nThe grant of authority contained in section 102(a) is limited to “such actions as \n5 \nmay be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads . . . in the vicinity of \n6 \nthe United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the \n7 \nUnited States.” IIRIRA § 102(a) (emphasis added). The Secretary’s waiver notices, \n8 \nhowever, declared that DHS will “replace existing primary fencing.” 82 Fed. Reg. at \n9 \n35,985; id. at 42,830. By its ordinary, obvious meaning, these “replacement” fences fall \n10 \noutside this clear statutory mandate. \n11 \nA replacement fence, first of all, is not an “additional physical barrier,” even under \n12 \nthe Government’s interpretation of that phrase, because it does not “add” a barrier, create \n13 \n“more” barriers, or provide “extra” or “supplementary” barriers. See Doc. #18 at 23 \n14 \n(using the quoted terms to define “additional”). By definition, “replacement” results in no \n15 \nnet gain (no “addition”) because the new barrier is merely a substitute or successor to the \n16 \nfence it is replacing. See Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\n17 \nwebster.com/dictionary/replacement (“one that replaces another especially in a job or \n18 \nfunction”); https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/replaces (“to take the place of \n19 \nespecially as a substitute or successor”). This conclusion is compelled from the language \n20 \nof the waivers themselves, which, instead of moving to “install additional physical \n21 \nbarriers” as required by subsection 102(a), clearly state that stating DHS “will replace \n22 \nexisting primary fencing,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 35,984; id. at 42,380 (emphasis added). \n23 \nSecond, the replacement projects near Calexico and San Diego are not in areas of \n24 \nhigh illegal entry. See discussion supra § I.B. The “areas” in which these barriers will be \n25 \nconstructed already have fences, meaning there should be little to no illegal crossings \n26 \noccurring in these areas. If, conversely, illegal crossings continue to occur despite the \n27 \nexisting fences, then support for the subsection 102(a) requirement that the barrier “deter \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

Either way, one of the \n2  subsection 102(a) requirements must inherently be absent and the waivers ultra vires.  \n3  The Government’s attempt to side-step this fatal flaw is unpersuasive. The waivers \n4  and the Government’s prior briefing rely solely on sector-wide statistics. See 82 Fed. \n5  Reg. at 35,984; id. at 42,380; Doc. #18 at 27. These are massive sectors, however, with \n6  opportunities for crossings in varying levels of difficulty. The San Diego Sector’s \n7  operational area includes 60 miles of land border with Mexico, 114 miles of costal \n8  border, and encompasses 56,830 square miles. Pls.’ Stmt. ¶ 5. The El Centro Sector is \n9  responsible for 70 miles of land border and covers 107,750 square miles. Id. ¶ 7. To \n10  facilitate Border Patrol’s ability to manage such large areas, these sectors are broken \n11  down into smaller subunits of stations and geographic zones. Id. ¶¶ 5-7. Illegal entry into \n12  San Diego 39 border zones or El Centro’s 50 border zones is not uniform, yet the \n13  Secretaries have declared all 164,000 square miles in these sectors to be areas of high \n14  illegal entry. The sector-wide statistics, therefore, are not an appropriate measure for \n15  projects that are addressing specific segments of the border area, especially since \n16  Congress focused on closing specific points of illegal entry in enacting section 102.  \n17  2.  The San Diego prototype project will not deter illegal crossing and \nfalls outside of section 102’s grant of authority. \n18 \nThe border wall prototypes project—to evaluate various design features for \n19 \npotential inclusion in a border wall going forward—is similarly well outside the scope of \n20 \nsection 102 as it has no direct deterrent effect whatsoever.6 Adopting the Secretary’s \n21 \ninterpretation of subsection 102(a), which allows any actions that might indirectly benefit \n22 \nfuture barrier design qualifies for a waiver, nullifies any limits to section 102. Under this \n23 \nlogic, the Secretary could issue a waiver covering Glacier National Park along the U.S-\n24 \n                                         \n25 \n6 Media footage of the already complete prototype project demonstrates as much. See \n26  Jennifer Medina, Eight Ways to Build a Border Wall, N.Y. Times, Nov. 8, 2017, \nhttps://nyti.ms/2j8STIR (showing major gaps between each model, none of which were \n27 \nbuilt directly on the borderline). \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

Yet, that is clearly inconsistent with section 102’s intent based on \n3  the statutory text when read as a whole. \n4  Under the Government’s view, moreover, that action would be both appropriate \n5  and also beyond judicial review, leaving no legal mechanism for preventing the Secretary \n6  from carrying out such a plan. That logical implication of the Government’s position \n7  demonstrates the waivers here far exceed any statutory mandate, and are thereforeultra \n8  vires. \n9  3.  The waivers are also ultra vires because they are not “necessary to \nensure expeditious construction” as required by section 102(c). \n10 \nSection 102’s waiver provision is expressly limited to situations in which a waiver \n11 \nof laws is “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under \n12 \nthis section.” IIRIRA § 102(c)(1). Yet, the waivers here fail to provide any basis to \n13 \nsupport that conclusion and merely parrot the statutory language. See 82 Fed. Reg. at \n14 \n35,985; id. at 42,830. The Secretary’s failure to provide any information or basis to \n15 \nsupport her conclusion that these waivers were necessary makes them ultra vires and \n16 \nbeyond the scope of authority granted her by Congress.  \n17 \n4.  The Secretary’s waivers are ultra vires because section 102’s grant \n18 \nof authority was limited to the construction activities specifically \n19  mandated by Congress. \n20  When section 102 is construed as a whole, these projects also fall outside of the \n21  limits of the waiver authority because Congress did not intent subsection 102(c) to apply \n22  projects beyond those specifically mandated in the 1996, 2005, 2006, and 2008 Acts. \n23  Avila v.

First, the grant of \n2  authority in section 102 turns on a showing of necessity. Subsection 102(a), for example, \n3  authorizes actions necessary to install additional barriers to deter illegal crossings in \n4  areas of high illegal entry. In subsection 102(c), the waiver provision’s scope is limited to \n5  waivers that are necessary to ensure expeditious construction of those additional barriers. \n6  Subsection 102(b), in turn, provides the context as to what Congress meant both by \n7  additional barriers and by necessity. In subsection 102(b)(1), Congress expressly \n8  mandated that the Secretary take all necessary steps to “gain operational control of the \n9  southwest border,” and to do so by completing construction of fencing in “priority areas” \n10  by “not later than December 31, 2008.” IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A) & (B). It is these “priority \n11  areas” that would allow the Secretary to achieve “operational control” of the southwest \n12  border by the end of 2008, thus making expeditious construction “necessary.” See Pls.’ \n13  Stmt. ¶¶ 6, 7. \n14  Along these line, a judge in this District construing this language concluded that \n15  “the ‘barriers and roads’ alluded to” in subection 102(c) are “the Triple Fence project \n16  located along the U.S.-Mexico border in the vicinity of San Diego,” Sierra Club, 2005 \n17  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *19, which were those mandated in subsection 102(b) at the \n18  time. This analysis was central to Judge Burn’s determination that the delegation of \n19  authority was specifically limited because the waiver went only to the “completion of this \n20  particular 14-mile California border Triple Fence authorized by IIRIRA, and only upon \n21  the Secretary making a determination of necessity. The delegation is restricted to waiver \n22  of laws solely in the context of construction of this Triple Fence, not their ‘repeal.’” Id. at \n23  *21 (emphasis in original). Citing to the Government’s brief to support this narrow \n24  construction, Judge Burns adopted the position that “the sole purpose for the Waiver” \n25  was to terminate the litigation at issue. Id. (citing Defs.’ Br. at 11:2-4). Again, quoting the \n26  Government, the court found that “Congress enacted (and amended) the Waiver \n27  Legislation to permit the Secretary to expedite construction of this fence by removing \n28 \nMEM.

To that \n4  end, the 1996 Act largely focused on constructing reinforced, second, and third fences in \n5  the 14-mile section of the border near San Diego. Congress, for example, required the \n6  Attorney General to “promptly acquire such easements as may be necessary” to complete \n7  that mandate. Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. C, § 102(b)(2). Thus, Congress authorized the \n8  Attorney General to waive the provisions of the Endangered Species Act and National \n9  Environmental Policy Act, if necessary, “to ensure expeditious construction of the \n10  barriers and roads under this section.” Id. at § 102(c). \n11  The fact that this 14-mile stretch of additional fencing had not been completed, \n12  despite the mandate, led supporters of the REAL ID Act of 2005 to expand the scope of \n13  the section 102(c) waiver to complete the Triple Fence project as previously mandated in \n14  1996. See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 256 (“It is the sense of the Congress that completing the 14-\n15  mile border fence project required to be carried out under section 102(b) of the [IIRIRA \n16  of 1996] should be a priority for the Secretary.”) As the sponsor of the bill, Rep. \n17  Sensenbrenner stated: “[T]he REAL ID Act will waive Federal laws to the extent \n18  necessary to complete gaps in the San Diego border security fence which is still stymied \n19  8 years after congressional authorization.” 151 Cong. Rec. H453-04 atH454 (Feb. 9, \n20  2005) (emphasis added).  \n21  Many proponents of the REAL ID Act shared this narrow understanding of the \n22  waiver and assured the bill’s opponents the new 102(c)(1) authority would not be overly \n23  broad. Compare, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. E243-03 at E243 (Feb. 15, 2005) (statement of \n24  Rep. Udall) (expressing concern about the overbreadth of the waiver authority), with, \n25  e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H453-04 at H471 (Feb. 9, 2005) (statement of Rep. Hoekstra) \n26  (“H.R. 418 provides the Secretary . . . with authority to waive environmental laws, so that \n27  the border fence running 14 miles east from the Pacific Ocean at San Diego may finally \n28  be completed.”); id.

Lungren) (“H.R. 418 will remove the impediments to \n4  completing the fence along the San Diego corridor of our southern border.”). \n5  Some opponents of the new waiver authority shared this view that it was limited to \n6  completing the San Diego fence. Rep. Hastings, for example, stated: \n7  H.R. 418 also allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all laws \nnecessary for the construction of the San Diego border wall. None of us are \n8 \nof a mind to believe that the completion of the 3-mile gap in that wall should \n9  not be undertaken. \n10  151 Cong. Rec. H527-03 at H529 (Feb. 10, 2005) (emphasis added). An exchange \n11  between two California representatives on competing sides of the issue further confirms \n12  that “completing the 3 1/2 miles of border fencing” was “the issue driving this extreme \n13  [waiver] language.” 151 Cong. Rec. H536-03 at H557 (Feb. 10, 2005). \n14  The Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the impact of H.R. 418 was also \n15  based on a narrow understanding of the scope of the waiver authority.  \n16  [IIRIRA] provided for the construction of a series of roads and fences along \nthe U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego to deter entry of illegal immigrants. \n17 \nAll but about three miles of this barrier have been completed. Since \n18  February 2004, completion of the barrier has been delayed because of \nenvironmental conflicts with the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). \n19 \nH.R. 418 would permit DHS to waive this act and any other laws as \n20  necessary to complete construction of the barrier.  \n21 \nCongressional Budget Office, Cost Estimate, H.R. 418 – REAL ID Act, as appearing in \n22 \n151 Cong. Rec. H437-02 at H438 (Feb. 9, 2005). In interpreting the waiver provision, the \n23 \nCBO concluded it would not impose significant additional costs because it merely \n24 \nauthorized  \n25 \nthe Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to waive any laws \nnecessary to complete construction of a physical barrier between the United \n26 \nStates and Mexico near San Diego, California, and prohibit any court from \n27 \nhaving jurisdiction to hear claims or ordering relief for damage resulting \nfrom the waiver of such laws. This provision would preempt state authority. \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

(emphasis added). \n2  This legislative history confirms the plain reading of section 102 as a whole: the \n3  waiver power means what it says by being limited to only those projects that were \n4  “necessary” in 2005, 2006, and 2008 to complete the “priority areas” and allow the \n5  Secretary to gain “operational control.” Congress did not intend to give future Secretary’s \n6  authority to waive all laws (federal, state, and local) for projects that could not be \n7  envisioned a decade ago. \n8  III.  THE BROAD AND UNBRIDLED GRANT OF WAIVER AUTHORITY IN SECTION 102 \nVIOLATES THE NON-DELEGATION DOCTRINE AS DEMONSTRATED BY \n9 \nDEFENDANTS ATTEMPT TO USE IT FOR PURELY POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. \n10 \nAs explained above, the scope of section 102’s authority is limited to situations \n11 \nwhere “expeditious” construction of “additional” barriers are actually “necessary to deter \n12 \nillegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry.” Because the waivers here fail that test, \n13 \nthey violate the Administrative Procedures Act and are ultra vires actions. To avoid that \n14 \nconclusion, however, the Government argues for an interpretation of section 102’s \n15 \nauthority that is essentially without limit. Under the Government’s view, Congress has \n16 \nprovided the Secretary with unfettered, and unreviewable discretion to waive any and all \n17 \nlaws for a project even the very conditions precedent for the exercise of that authority \n18 \ncontained in section 102 itself. If that interpretation is accepted, then section 102 violates \n19 \nthe Constitution’s non-delegation doctrine under longstanding Supreme Court precedent.  \n20 \nSeparation of powers between the three coordinate branches of our federal \n21 \ngovernment is a fundamental cornerstone of our democratic system of governance. A \n22 \ncomponent of separation of powers is the non-delegation doctrine, which protects the \n23 \npartition of authority between the legislative and executive branches. Under Article I of \n24 \nthe Constitution, “[a]ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \n25 \nthe United States.” U.S. Const. art I, § 1. As shown below, in its adoption and repeated \n26 \namendments of IIRIRA’s section 102, Congress improperly delegated undefined and \n27 \nopen-ended power to the Secretary of DHS in violation of the non-delegation doctrine. \n28 \nMEM.

That the Government asserts the Secretary has authority to proceed with \n4  the projects demonstrates that, under the Government’s interpretation of section 102, the \n5  law runs afoul of the non-delegation doctrine’s requirement that the Executive carry out \n6  work that adheres to the direction provided by Congress. As the Supreme Court described \n7  the requirement, to pass muster, legislation must articulate “an intelligible principle to \n8  which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to \n9  conform.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989). To assess whether an \n10  Executive agency is operating under an intelligible principle, Congress is required to \n11  clearly define its delegation by describing (1) the general policy to be achieved, (2) the \n12  public agency to implement it, and (3) the boundaries of the delegated authority. Id. at \n13  372-73.  \n14  Mistretta upheld the constitutionality of Congress’s creation of the federal \n15  Sentencing Commission under the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act. Under the statute, the \n16  Commission was directed to create sentencing guidelines for various categories of \n17  offenses and defendants, with judicial review limited to appeals of sentences outside of, \n18  or incorrectly applying to, the guidelines’ ranges of imprisonment. 488 U.S. at 367-68. \n19  Importantly, the Mistretta Court took great care distinguishing the three elements of the \n20  test and the substance of the authorization itself. The Court focused on the fact that the \n21  legislation created multiple goals and purposes to articulate sentencing policy, such as to \n22  effectuate certainty and fairness in sentencing, to avoid unwarranted disparities among \n23  similarly situated defendants, to maintain flexibility for individualized sentences, and to \n24  provide needed correctional treatment. Id. at 374. Congress also “prescribed the specific \n25  tool—the guidelines system—for the Commission to use in regulating sentencing,” which \n26  represents the substance of the authorization. Id.  \n27  In addition, the Court pointed to two sets of seven and eleven factors Congress had \n28  provided to “guide the Commission in its formulation of offense categories.” Mistretta, \nMEM.

The numerous agency constraints represented the boundaries of the \n2  delegated authority, so that the Commission’s discretion was limited by the grade of the \n3  offense, nature and degree of harm, and the offender’s age, education, or mental and \n4  emotional condition. Id. at 374-76. Congress even provided explicit limits on the range of \n5  minimum and maximum sentences, which effectively (and in the case of statutory range \n6  limits, literally) act as additional boundaries in developing just sentences. Id. Such clearly \n7  delineated policies and boundaries satisfied the Court in Mistretta by providing an \n8  intelligible principle, distinct from the authorization itself, to guide and circumscribe an \n9  agency’s implementation of that authorization. \n10  Applying the three prongs of Mistretta, the Government can only point with clarity \n11  to the second element – the public agency applying the legislation. In 2008, Congress \n12  amended section 102 and replaced the Attorney General with the Secretary of Homeland \n13  Security. Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V, § 564(a). This is the only aspect of \n14  IIRIRA that comports with Mistretta.  \n15  Section 102 authorizes two actions: to “install additional physical barriers and \n16  roads . . . in areas of high illegal entry into the United States” and to “waive all legal \n17  requirements” in support of such construction. IIRIRA § 102(a), (c). These represent the \n18  entire substance of the delegated legislative authority. A meaningful application of \n19  Mistretta shows Congress failed to provide any specific general policies or boundaries to \n20  constitute an intelligible principle for installing physical barriers along the southern \n21  border. See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372–373 (finding constitutional question satisfied \n22  when Congress, through the statute, “clearly delineates” among the three requisite \n23  elements). \n24  To start, section 102(a) provides no general policy guidance by which this Court \n25  can assess Mistretta’s first prong. In fact, earlier district courts, heavily relied upon by the \n26  Government, could not agree on which language might serve as IIRIRA’s general policy. \n27  For example, the court in Sierra Club v. Ashcroft found that “improvement of U.S. border \n28  protection is the clearly delineated general policy.” 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20. \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 22 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.674   Page 30 of 38\n \n1  However, the Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff court found the policy to be “to \n2  expeditiously install additional physical barriers and roads . . . to deter illegal crossings in \n3  areas of high illegal entry,” 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127. These are not mere differences in \n4  semantics. While Sierra Club established a general policy of improving border \n5  protection, however vague, Defenders of Wildlife conflated the policy of the authorization \n6  with the authorization itself.  \n7  A stated policy of installing physical barriers cannot be the substantive guide to \n8  waiving laws for installing such physical barriers. The waiver provision was not amended \n9  after the Sierra Club decision, yet other courts repeated the same circular error made by \n10  Defenders of Wildlife. See City of El Paso v. Chertoff, No. EP-08-CA-196-FM, 2008 U.S. \n11  Dist. LEXIS 83045, at *11 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2008); Save Our Heritage Org. v. \n12  Gonzales, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58, 63 (D.D.C. 2008). When courts cannot identify a common \n13  statutory policy goal, and the policy some did point to was incorrect, the statutory scheme \n14  cannot survive Mistretta scrutiny. \n15  Nor can section 102 satisfy the third element of Mistretta: discernable boundaries \n16  of delegated authority. 488 U.S. at 372-73. The Government’s proffered interpretation of \n17  the statute, and the waiver provision in particular, provides no substantive boundaries as \n18  to which laws should be waived under what conditions or when. Arguably, section 102(c) \n19  by its terms established the boundaries of the waiver authority as those laws the Secretary \n20  “determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under \n21  this section.” But the waivers here effectively read out any limiting force to this language.  \n22  Such a reading would provide “virtually unfettered” discretion to the Executive in this \n23  way would undermine the separation of power principle accurately described in Panama \n24  Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 416 (1935) (“Congress left the matter to the \n25  President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.”)  \n26  The earlier district courts also tried to establish the boundaries set out in section \n27  102, per Mistretta’s second prong, but there they could not agree either. The Sierra Club \n28  court found the boundary to be the “waiver of laws and regulations which the DHS \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 23 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.675   Page 31 of 38\n \n1  Secretary determines impede completion of this particular 14-mile California border \n2  Triple Fence authorized by IIRIRA.” 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20-21 (emphasis \n3  in original) (citing the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3). Contrast that \n4  with Defenders of Wildlife which held the boundary to be “Congress’s requirement that \n5  the Secretary may waive only those laws that he determines necessary to ensure \n6  expeditious construction.” 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127. It seems the Sierra Club court aimed \n7  to establish an actual physical boundary, which has since expired; yet, both decisions are \n8  circularly rooted in the construction of the authorization itself, and provide no intelligible \n9  boundaries concerning which laws the DHS Secretary may waive under what \n10  circumstances. Emphatically, the “expeditious construction of barriers and roads” cannot \n11  serve as the Congressional boundary which defines and guides DHS’s act of “expeditious \n12  construction of barriers and roads.” \n13  Also in some of the earlier cases, the plaintiffs asked the district courts to \n14  invalidate section 102 based on the scope of the waiver authority, i.e., the sheer number \n15  of laws that could be waived, rather than assessing whether the policies and boundaries \n16  Congress articulated in section 102 were clearly delineated as an intelligible principle \n17  under Mistretta. Cty. of El Paso, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83045, at *9–13; Sierra Club, \n18  2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *17-19; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128-\n19  29. Plaintiffs here do not challenge section 102 on that ground, so that aspects of the \n20  holdings are irrelevant to the instant case.  \n21  Next, Defendants, like the district courts cited herein, hope to show a successfully \n22  bounded scope of discretion for any statute that included the word “necessary.” Doc. #18-\n23  1 at 35. For example, compare the waiver authority in IIRIRA, “necessary to ensure \n24  expeditious construction of barriers and roads” to the Controlled Substances Act’s \n25  “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.” Touby v. United States, 500 \n26  U.S. 160, 163 citing 21 U.S.C. § 811(h). The similarities of the two legislative \n27  approaches cease with the use of the word “necessary,” however. In Touby, the Court \n28  upheld an amendment to the Controlled Substance Act because Congress had made clear \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 24 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.676   Page 32 of 38\n \n1  it was allowing the Attorney General to temporarily schedule a controlled substance, for a \n2  limited time to combat an emerging problem with illegal designer drugs. 500 U.S. at 163 \n3  (emphasis added). Still, even under the temporary authority, the Attorney General was \n4  required to consider three of the eight codified factors for permanent scheduling. Id. And, \n5  based on the limited procedural requirements, Congress only allowed the Drug \n6  Enforcement Agency’s temporary scheduling order to be valid for one year, during which \n7  time the agency could initiate a permanent scheduling order in full compliance with the \n8  Controlled Substances Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. Id. at 164.  \n9  In contrast, the only substantive limit to the waiver power in section 102(c) is the \n10  number of laws the Secretary decides might be standing in his or her way. Even \n11  Defendants’ brief can do no better than asserting “the waiver authority is limited to \n12  construction along the border for which a necessary determination has been made. Doc. \n13  #18-1 at 35:4-16. Defendants want this Court to find that the occurrence of the word \n14  “necessary” serves as a sufficient boundary for purposes of Constitutional separation of \n15  powers. Under the delegation doctrine’s well-settled principles, this cannot be.  \n16  Finally, Defendants and earlier district courts emphasized the fact that this \n17  delegation of authority concerned issues of border control and national security. Doc. \n18  #18-1 at 35-36; see also, e.g., Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *22. The \n19  Sierra Club decision distinguished the IIRIRA waivers from other Supreme Court \n20  precedent on grounds that the Executive Branch is afforded immense deference on \n21  matters of foreign affairs. Id. at *25 (citing Panama Refining, supra, and A.L.A. Schechter \n22  Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). Significantly, however, the Supreme \n23  Court recently limited the deference afforded to the President in matters of foreign \n24  relations. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 2089-90 (2015).  \n25  Zivotofsky concerned the President’s power to recognize foreign states and their \n26  borders and capitals. While the Court found that power plenary and independent from \n27  Congressional interference, it also squarely addressed years of unclear precedent \n28  (particularly United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936)) \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 25 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.677   Page 33 of 38\n \n1  regarding the President’s general foreign affairs authority. Zivotofsky, 135 S.Ct. at 2084-\n2  90. The Supreme Court expressly “decline[d] to acknowledge that unbounded power” \n3  and ruled that prior precedent did not hold that “the President is free from Congress’ \n4  lawmaking power in the field of international relations.” Id. at 2089–90. Instead, \n5  “whether the realm is foreign or domestic, it is still the Legislative Branch, not the \n6  Executive Branch, that makes the law,” and “[t]he Executive is not free from the ordinary \n7  controls and checks of Congress merely because foreign affairs are at issue.” Id. at 2090.  \n8  Other courts have followed this approach, explicitly questioning unrestrained \n9  deferential treatment earlier cases presumed in matters of foreign affairs: “When \n10  confronting a statutory question touching on subjects of national security and foreign \n11  affairs, a court does not adequately discharge its duty by pointing to the broad authority \n12  of the President and Congress and vacating the field without considered analysis.” Ctr. \n13  for Biological Diversity v. Mattis, 868 F.3d 803, 821-29 (9th Cir. 2017) (applying federal \n14  statutes to construction of a military base overseas); Tinian Women Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of \n15  the Navy, No. 16-cv-00022, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170080, at *31-48 (D.N. Mar. I. Oct. \n16  13, 2017) (applying federal statutes to relocation of marines among overseas military \n17  bases); Conservation Council for Haw. v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 97 F. Supp. 3d \n18  1210, 1220-38 (D. Haw. 2015) (applying federal statutes to Naval sonar testing offshore). \n19  This Court should afford no weight to this aspect of Defendants’ arguments and the prior \n20  district court cases, because the cited precedent has been sharply curtailed.  \n21  To conclude, illustrative of what can happen when Congress fails to provide \n22  adequate policy guidance to Executive agencies is the two DHS waivers at issue in this \n23  case. With little more to go on than “install additional physical barriers and roads” in \n24  “areas of high illegal entry into the United States,” the Government hopes to greatly \n25  exceed that directive by waiving legal oversight for replacement and improvement \n26  projects, prototypes of barriers, along with open-ended “upkeep” and “supporting” \n27  projects. Defendants’ proposed work, which would be exempt from federal law, has \n28  unlawfully strayed from Congress’s scant directive of “expeditious construction of \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 26 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.678   Page 34 of 38\n \n1  barriers and roads.” (emphasis added.) Through three amendments over twelve years, the \n2  section 102 waiver authority has always pertained to the construction of “additional” \n3  fencing and physical barriers. IIRIRA has never contemplated replacement work or \n4  construction of prototypes DHS now proposes. Nor is there any showing this work would \n5  be undertaken in areas of high illegal entry. Pls.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 13-20. When Congress fails to \n6  provide clear policy goals and defined boundaries of its intended delegated authority, i.e., \n7  no overarching intelligible principle, agency overreach in inevitable. Granting this motion \n8  would stop such unlawful overreach. \n9  IV.  THE WAIVER AUTHORITY—IF DEEMED TO AUTHORIZE THE PROJECTS AT \nISSUE—VIOLATES THE PRESENTMENT CLAUSE BY ALLOWING THE SECRETARY \n10 \nTO ENGAGING IN LEGISLATIVE REPEALS. \n11 \nSubection 102(c)(2)’s waiver provision also runs afoul of the Presentment Clause \n12 \nbecause it effectively grants a broad power of repeal to the Secretary. See Clinton v. City \n13 \nof New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (holding line-item veto power violated the \n14 \npresentment clause because “[i]n both legal and practical effect, the President has \n15 \namended two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,” just as the Secretary has \n16 \ndone here with regard to dozens of Acts of Congress). The Coalition Plaintiffs’ adopt and \n17 \nincorporate the arguments made on this point by the State of California and Center for \n18 \nBiological Diversity without burdening the Court with unnecessary repetition. \n19 \nV.  THE JURISDICTIONAL STRIPPING PROVISION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER \n20  SEPARATION OF POWERS AND FEDERALISM GROUNDS.  \n21  A.   Without inherent ultra vires jurisdiction, section 102(c)(2) would run \n  afoul of fundamental separation of powers protections. \n22 \nThe Government has taken the position in this case that “all non-constitutional \n23 \nclaims are barred” under section 102(c)(2)’s jurisdictional stripping provision. Doc. #18-\n24 \n1 at 12; see also id. at 13 (“The only avenue for challenging agency action here is a \n25 \nconstitutional claim.”). While this view is wrong because this Court retains its inherent \n26 \nultra vires jurisdiction, see discussion supra § 2, the Government’s interpretation would \n27 \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 27 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.679   Page 35 of 38\n \n1  render section 102(c)(2) unconstitutional.7 Indeed, the ultra vires cases rest on a \n2  recognition of the fundamental constitutional problem that would otherwise arise if all \n3  judicial review were eliminated to challenge actions that exceed Congressional authority. \n4  B.  Congress lacks the power to eliminate the concurrent jurisdiction of \nstate courts unless it vests that power in an inferior federal court.  \n5 \nSection 102 is not just remarkable in the unbridled (and impermissible) delegation \n6 \nof authority granted to the Secretary to waive vital federal (as well as state and local) \n7 \nlaws, it is also remarkable with regard to the hurdles its drafters inserted in an attempt to \n8 \nprevent judicial review of such waivers. While Congress is empowered to establish or \n9 \neliminate “inferior [federal] Courts” under Article III, § 1, that is not what subsection \n10 \n102(c)(2) seeks to accomplish. Rather, this provision seeks to unwind the Madisonian \n11 \nCompromise that forms the basis for the concurrent judicial power of state and federal \n12 \ncourts that provides a bedrock to the Constitution. “This so-called Madisonian \n13 \nCompromise bridged the divide ‘between those who thought that the establishment of \n14 \nlower federal courts should be constitutionally mandatory and those who thought there \n15 \nshould be no federal courts at all except for a Supreme Court with, inter alia, appellate \n16 \njurisdiction to review state court judgments.’” Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, 745-46 \n17 \n(2009) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quotation omitted). “The assumption that state courts \n18 \nwould continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims was essential to \n19 \nthis compromise.” Id. (citation omitted). \n20 \nThis fundamental problem with section 102(c)(2) was known to Congress. A legal \n21 \nanalysis of the jurisdictional stripping provision recognized that the wresting of \n22 \nconcurrent jurisdiction from the state courts was a novel—and potentially fatal—aspect \n23 \nof the law. See 151 Cong. Rec. H536-03 at H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) (recognizing that “an \n24 \n                                         \n25 \n7 Conversely, if this Court correctly determines the waivers are void under its ultra vires \n26  jurisdiction, then there is no need to reach these constitutional issues. See, e.g., \nValenzuela Gallardo v. Lynch, 818 F.3d 808, 816-17 (9th Cir. 2016) (discussing the \n27 \nconstitutional avoidance doctrine). \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM. J.  - 28 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 29-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.680   Page 36 of 38\n \n1  argument can be made that Congress does not possess the authority to regulate the \n2  jurisdiction of state courts directly,” as state courts are “independent and autonomous \n3  from the federal court system” and broadly vested with concurrent jurisdiction). \n4  Put simply, Congress has the authority to vest exclusive jurisdiction in a federal \n5  court (thereby removing concurrent judicial power from the state courts), and the power \n6  to remove judicial power from the federal courts (thereby leaving that judicial power \n7  solely to the state courts). But Congress does not have the authority to remove the judicial \n8  power from both the state and federal courts by vesting “exclusive jurisdiction” over \n9  issues into a federal court only then to also remove that judicial power from the very \n10  federal court it just vested with that power. Cf. Healy v. Ratta, 292 U.S. 263, 270 (1934). \n11  Yet that is precisely what section 102(c)(2) impermissibly seeks to accomplish, which \n12  renders it unconstitutional. \n13  C.  Subsection 102(c)(2) violates the Coalition Plaintiffs’ due process rights \nand impairs their First Amendment right to petition the government. \n14 \nSubsection 102(c)(2) also unconstitutionally deprives the Coalition Plaintiffs of \n15 \ntheir due process rights and impairs their First Amendment right to petition the \n16 \ngovernment. In striking down a legal funding statute that restricted the ability of \n17 \ngovernment-provided attorneys to raise certain arguments, the Supreme Court has \n18 \nrecognized that “[t]he restriction imposed by the statute here threatens severe impairment \n19 \nof the judicial function,” by removing arguments regarding “questions of statutory \n20 \nvalidity and constitutional authority,” which created “[a] scheme so inconsistent with \n21 \naccepted separation-of-powers principles” that it could not withstand scrutiny under the \n22 \nFirst Amendment’s freedom of speech. Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, \n23 \n546 (2001). Importantly, the Court also recognized Congress’s intent was “designed to \n24 \ninsulate the Government’s interpretation of the Constitution from judicial challenge. The \n25 \nConstitution does not permit the Government to confine litigants and their attorneys in \n26 \nthis manner.” Id. at 548-49. Similarly, the Coalition Plaintiffs’ property and liberty \n27 \ninterests in ensuring environmental laws and interests are protected cannot be removed \n28 \nMEM. IN SUPP. OF SUMM.

Nos. 18, 28, 29, 30, 35.] \n19   \n20     These three consolidated cases involve challenges to Waiver Determinations made \n21 \nby former Secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security on August 2, 2017 and \n22 \nSeptember 12, 2017 pursuant to section 102 of IIRIRA1 waiving the legal requirements of \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  1 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. \n1 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1936   Page 2 of 101\n \n1  NEPA,2 the ESA,3 the CZMA4 and more than 30 additional laws not at issue in these \n2 \ncases.  The Waiver Determinations concern two types of border wall construction \n3 \nprojects in San Diego County: (1) the “border wall prototype project”; and (2) the \n4 \n5  replacement of fifteen miles of existing border fence in the San Diego Sector and three \n6 \nmiles of existing border fence in the El Centro Sector  (“border fence replacement \n7 \nprojects”).  The Plaintiffs allege variously that (1) the Waivers are ultra vires acts that \n8 \n9  exceed the authority delegated by Congress; and (2) the Waivers are unconstitutional acts \n10 \nunder a variety of legal doctrines.   \n11 \nThe Court is aware that the subject of these lawsuits, border barriers, is currently \n12 \n13  the subject of heated political debate in and between the United States and the Republic \n14 \nof Mexico as to the need, efficacy and the source of funding for such barriers.  In its \n15 \nreview of this case, the Court cannot and does not consider whether underlying decisions \n16 \n17  to construct the border barriers are politically wise or prudent.  As fellow Indiana native \n18 \nChief Justice Roberts observed in addressing a case surrounded by political \n19 \ndisagreement: “Court[s] are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess \n20 \n21  neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are \n22 \nentrusted to our Nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26  2 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. \n3 Endangered Species Act. \n27  4 Coastal Zone Management Act. \n2 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1937   Page 3 of 101\n \n1  disagree with them.  It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their \n2 \npolitical choices.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012).  \n3 \nHere, the Court will focus on whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to \n4 \n5  enact the challenged law and whether the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security \n6 \nproperly exercised the powers delegated by Congress.    \n7 \nBefore the Court are three cross-motions for summary judgment.  A hearing was \n8 \n9  held on February 9, 2018. (Dkt. No. 44.)  Michael Cayaban, Esq. and Noah Golden \n10 \nFrasner, Esq. appeared on behalf of Plaintiffs People of the State of California and the \n11 \nCalifornia Coastal Commission; Brian Segee, Esq. and Brendan Cummings, Esq. \n12 \n13  appeared on behalf of Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity; and Sarah Hanneken, Esq. \n14 \nappeared on behalf of the Plaintiffs Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, and Animal Legal \n15 \nDefense Fund.  (Id.)  Galen Thorp, Esq. appeared on behalf of Defendants.  (Id.)  The \n16 \n17  parties filed supplemental briefs on February 13, 2018.  (Dkt. Nos. 46, 47, 48, 49.)   \n18 \n  Based on the parties’ briefs, the supporting documentation, the applicable law, the \n19 \narguments made at the hearing and the supplemental briefing, the Court DENIES \n20 \n21  Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment and GRANTS Defendants’ motions for \n22 \nsummary judgment.  \n23 \n/// \n24 \n25  /// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n3 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1938   Page 4 of 101\n \n1  I.  BACKGROUND \n2 \n  A.   Section 102 of Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n3 \nResponsibility Act \n4 \n5    In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n6 \nResponsibility Act (“IIRIRA”), which, pursuant to Section 102(a), required the Attorney \n7 \nGeneral to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers \n8 \n9  and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the \n10 \nvicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry \n11 \ninto the United States.”  Pub. L. No. 104–208, Div. C., Title I, § 102(a), 110 Stat. 3009, \n12 \n13  3009–554 (1996), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note.  IIRIRA Section 102(c), as originally \n14 \nenacted, authorized the Attorney General to waive the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n15 \n(“ESA”) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”) when he \n16 \n17  determined such waiver “was necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n18 \nand roads under this section.”  Id. § 102(c).  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 \n19 \nabolished the Immigration and Naturalization Service and transferred responsibility for \n20 \n21  the construction of border barriers from the Attorney General to the Department of \n22 \nHomeland Security (“DHS”).  Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).  In 2005, the \n23 \nREAL ID Act, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, Title I, § 102, 119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (May \n24 \n25  11, 2005), amended the waiver authority of section 102(c) expanding the Secretary of \n26 \nDHS’ authority to waive “all legal requirements” that the Secretary, in his or her own \n27 \n4 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1939   Page 5 of 101\n \n1  discretion, determines “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and \n2 \nroads under this section.”  Id.  It also added a judicial review provision that limited the \n3 \ndistrict court’s jurisdiction to hear any causes or action concerning the Secretary’s waiver \n4 \n5  authority to solely constitutional claims.  Id. § 102(c)(2)(A).  Further, the provision \n6 \nforeclosed appellate court review and directed any review of the district court’s decision \n7 \nbe raised by petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States.  \n8 \n9  Id. § 102(c)(2)(C).  \n10 \n  Section 102 consists of three sections: (1) section 102(a) describes the general \n11 \npurpose of the statute; (2) section 102(b) specifies Congress’ mandate for specific border \n12 \n13  barrier construction; and (3) section 102(c) grants the Secretary the discretion to waive \n14 \n“all legal requirements” he or she “determines necessary to ensure expeditious \n15 \nconstruction of the barriers and roads” and provides for limited judicial review of the \n16 \n17  Secretary’s waiver decision to solely constitutional violations.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note. \n18 \n  Since its enactment in 1996, IIRIRA section 102 has been amended three times \n19 \nalthough the general purpose of the statute under section 102(a) has remained the same.     \n20 \n21  When IIRIRA was first enacted in 1996, section 102(b) mandated “construction along the \n22 \n14 miles of the international land border of the United States, starting at the Pacific \n23 \nOcean and extending eastward of second and third fences, in addition to the existing \n24 \n25  reinforced fence, and for roads between the fences.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(b) (1996).   \n26 \n27 \n5 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1940   Page 6 of 101\n \n1    The Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, \n2 \n2006), amended the specific mandates of section 102(b).  It directed the DHS to “provide \n3 \nfor at least 2 layers of reinforced fencing, [and] the installation of additional physical \n4 \n5  barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors” in five specific segments along the U.S.-\n6 \nMexico border encompassing the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.  \n7 \nId.  It also set dates of completion for two segments to be completed by certain dates in \n8 \n9  2008.  Id.  \n10 \n  Fourteen months later, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. \n11 \n110-161, Div. E, Title V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007), again amended the \n12 \n13  mandates of section 102(b) and they currently remain the operative version of the statute. \n14 \n  In its current version, section 102, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, provides, \n15 \n(a) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such actions \n16  as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads \n(including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the \n17 \nvicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high \n18  illegal entry into the United States.   \n \n19 \n(b) Construction of fencing and road improvements along the border.-- \n20   \n(1) Additional fencing along southwest border.-- \n21 \n \n22    (A) Reinforced fencing.--In carrying out subsection (a) [of this \n  note], the Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced  \n23 \n  fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where \n24    fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the \n  installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, \n25 \n  and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border. \n26   \n27 \n6 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1941   Page 7 of 101\n \n1     (B) Priority areas.--In carrying out this section [Pub.

Factual Background \n11 \n  On January 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order No. \n12 \n13  13767 entitled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements.”  (Dkt. \n14 \nNo. 30-5, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 7, Executive Order, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793.)

McAleenan.  (Dkt. No. 17cv1911, Dkt.

Because the Waiver Determinations \n12 \n13  are void based on the ultra vires acts of the Secretaries, Plaintiffs also assert violations of \n14 \nNEPA, ESA, CZMA and the APA.  Plaintiffs also allege the following violations of the \n15 \nU.S. Constitution: \n16 \n17 \n                                                \n18 \n19  of the U.S. Constitution; (4) violation of non-delegation doctrine under Article I, Section 1 and Article \nII, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution; and (5) violations of Article III, the First Amendment right to \n20 \npetition, the Tenth Amendment by removing concurrent jurisdiction of state courts, and due process \nrights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The Court declines to address the alternative APA claim \n27  based on the FOIA requests until after the FOIA claim, itself, is resolved.   \n15 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1950   Page 16 of 101\n \n1  U.S. 317, 325, 327 (1986).  Summary judgment is appropriate if the “pleadings, \n2 \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the \n3 \naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the \n4 \n5  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  A fact is \n6 \nmaterial when it affects the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \n7 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986).  “Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier \n8 \n9  of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no ‘genuine issue for trial.’”  Matsushita \n10 \nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).   \n11 \nB.  Article III Standing as to the State of California     \n12 \n13    The State of California argues it has Article III standing because it will suffer \n14 \ninjury to its real property that it owns and manages adjacent to the border wall projects.10  \n15 \nIt contends that the Waiver Determinations infringe on California’s procedural and \n16 \n17  sovereign rights in creating and enforcing its own laws and obtaining benefits provided \n18 \nunder NEPA and the APA.  Defendants respond that California has not carried its burden \n19 \nto establish standing as to each of its numerous claims and has not demonstrated that the \n20 \n21  Waiver Determinations impact state laws which would be enforceable in connection with \n22 \nthe projects at issue.   \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26  10 Initially, California argued it has a concrete and particularized interest in protecting its natural, \nrecreational, agricultural, historical, and cultural resources for the use, enjoyment and benefit of its \n27  residents but did not reassert these interests in its reply. \n16 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1951   Page 17 of 101\n \n1     Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution requires that a plaintiff have \n2 \nstanding to bring a claim.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).   \n3 \nIn order “to satisfy Article III’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has \n4 \n5  suffered an ‘injury in fact’ that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or \n6 \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \n7 \nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, \n8 \n9  that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \n10 \nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. \n11 \nat 560–61).  The party seeking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing its \n12 \n13  existence.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  “A plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim \n14 \nhe seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.”  Davis v. Fed. Election \n15 \nComm’n, 552 U.S. 724, 734 (2008).     \n16 \n17    States have a “procedural right” and “quasi-sovereign interests” in protecting its \n18 \nnatural resources, such as air quality.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007) \n19 \n(“EPA’s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to \n20 \n21  Massachusetts that is both ‘actual’ and ‘imminent.’”).  In Georgia v. Tennessee Copper \n22 \nCo., 206 U.S. 230, 237 (1907), the State of Georgia filed an action to protect its citizens \n23 \nfrom air pollution originating from outside its borders and the Court asserted that a state, \n24 \n25  in its capacity as a quasi-sovereign, has an “interest independent of and behind the titles \n26 \nof its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.  It has the last word as to whether \n27 \n17 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1952   Page 18 of 101\n \n1  its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.”  \n2 \nId.   \n3 \n   Here, the parties dispute whether California has demonstrated an injury in fact, \n4 \n5  and whether the injury in fact is traceable to the Waiver Determinations.  As held by the \n6 \nU.S. Supreme Court, California has a procedural right and quasi-sovereign right in the \n7 \nenvironmental protections afforded by NEPA and the APA.  See id.  California provided \n8 \n9  declarations from experts detailing the possible harm to the Tijuana Estuary and harm to \n10 \nrare, threatened or endangered species.  (Dkt. No. 30-7, Clark Decl.; Dkt. No. 30-8, \n11 \nVanderplank Decl.; Dkt. No. 30:9, Delaplaine Decl.)  Eight prototype walls have already \n12 \n13  been constructed demonstrating that the injury is actual and the El Centro Sector border \n14 \nfence replacement project, which is currently undergoing consultation and may have \n15 \nalready begun construction, is also imminent.  The Court concludes that California has \n16 \n17  demonstrated an injury-in-fact that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent.   \n18 \n  Moreover, California argues it has a legally protected sovereign interest in creating \n19 \nand enforcing its own laws.  The Waiver Determinations will preclude the enforcement of \n20 \n21  California’s laws which will affect its sovereign interests.  Defendants object because \n22 \nPlaintiffs merely string cite to eight state code or regulations without explaining how \n23 \nthese provisions apply to the projects at issue.  But, as noted by Plaintiff, the Waiver \n24 \n25  Determinations do not identify which California law or regulation Defendants are \n26 \nwaiving and as an example it provides some provisions where the waiver would bar \n27 \n18 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1953   Page 19 of 101\n \n1  California’s enforcement of its laws as to DHS, its contractors, or to the State’s \n2 \npermitting authority or other legal actions.   \n3 \n  It is not disputed that the Waiver Determinations waive all legal requirements and \n4 \n5  include related state laws.  (See Dkt. No. 30-6, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. \n6 \n35,984-85; id., Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829-30.)  Defendants do not deny that California \n7 \nstate laws are being waived. The Court agrees with California that a bar to enforcing its \n8 \n9  own state laws related to the border wall projects is an injury in fact that supports Article \n10 \nIII standing.  The Court concludes that California has Article III standing.  \n11 \nC.  Whether the Court has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Non-Constitutional \n12 \n13  Claims based on Ultra Vires Acts of the Secretary of the DHS   \n14 \n  Defendants contend that the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ non-\n15 \nconstitutional claims, including whether the Secretaries’ actions concerning the two \n16 \n17  Waiver Determinations are ultra vires.  They explain that section 102 explicitly expresses \n18 \nCongress’ intent to bar the district court from exercising jurisdiction over any claims \n19 \narising from the Secretary of DHS’s waiver determination except for a constitutional \n20 \n21  violation.  Plaintiffs argue that the Court may consider whether the Waivers exercised by \n22 \nthe Secretaries constitute ultra vires acts as they exceed the authority granted to the \n23 \nSecretaries under section 102; therefore, they contend section 102(c)(2)’s judicial review \n24 \n25  bar on non-constitutional claims does not apply.  For the reasons stated below, the Court \n26 \nfinds that it may consider whether the Secretaries have violated any clear and mandatory \n27 \n19 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1954   Page 20 of 101\n \n1  statutory obligations set forth in section 102.  Finding that there are no such violations, \n2 \nthe Court upholds the jurisdictional bar and concludes that it does not have the \n3 \njurisdiction to hear any claims other than constitutional claims.   \n4 \n5    Section 102(c)(2)(A) provides that the “district courts of the United States shall \n6 \nhave exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action \n7 \nundertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n8 \n9  paragraph (1) [the waiver provision].  A cause of action or claim may only be brought \n10 \nalleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States.  The court shall not have \n11 \njurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.”  8 U.S.C. § \n12 \n13  1103(c)(2)(A). \n14 \n  As a starting point, there is a “strong presumption that Congress intends judicial \n15 \nreview of administrative action.”  Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 \n16 \n17  U.S. 667, 670 (1986); El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. United States, 632 F.3d 1272, 1276 \n18 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Bowen, 476 U.S. at 670) (“When considering whether a statute \n19 \nbars judicial review, ‘[w]e begin with the strong presumption that Congress intends \n20 \n21  judicial review of administrative action.’”).  In order to overcome the strong presumption, \n22 \nthere must be “clear and convincing” evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  Bowen, \n23 \n476 U.S. at 671-72.  The strong presumption may be overcome by “specific language or \n24 \n25  specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent,” or a \n26 \n27 \n20 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1955   Page 21 of 101\n \n1  “specific congressional intent to preclude judicial review that is ‘fairly discernible’ in the \n2 \ndetail of the legislative scheme.”  Id. at 673.   \n3 \n  In this case, the Center Plaintiff does not dispute that the presumption favoring \n4 \n5  judicial review has been overcome by the express language of section 102(c)(1) and does \n6 \nnot challenge Defendants’ argument on this issue.  Instead, all Plaintiffs argue that the \n7 \nAugust 2, 2017 and September 12, 2017 Waiver Determinations constitute ultra vires acts \n8 \n9  of the Secretary that do not fall under section 102 because the Waivers are not authorized \n10 \nby sections 102(a) or (b) and were not decisions made “pursuant to” section 102(c)(1).  \n11 \nTherefore, according to Plaintiffs, section 102(c)(2) does not apply, and the Waiver \n12 \n13  Determinations are subject to review by the Court.  Defendants respond that Plaintiffs \n14 \ncannot bypass the jurisdictional bar by framing their claims as ultra vires challenges \n15 \nwhen judicial review is expressly prohibited.  They argue that the Court should consider \n16 \n17  the plain meaning of section 102(c)(2) and that should be the end of the matter.   \n18 \n  Here, Congress expressly barred the district court’s review of non-constitutional \n19 \nclaims under section 102(c)(2), and this provision rebuts the strong presumption favoring \n20 \n21  judicial review of administrative actions.  However, the United States Supreme Court has \n22 \nidentified a narrow exception to an express statutory bar on judicial review when there is \n23 \na claim that an agency acted beyond its statutory authority.  See Leedom v. Kyne, 358 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n21 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1956   Page 22 of 101\n \n1  U.S. 184 (1958);11 Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp. Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. \n2 \n32 (1991); see also Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217 (D.C. Cir. 1988).   \n3 \n  In Kyne, the Supreme Court held that a district court had jurisdiction to review a \n4 \n5  non-final agency order “made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific \n6 \nprohibition in the [National Labor Relations Act].”  Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188.  The Kyne \n7 \ncourt found that a National Labor Relations Board’s (“NLRB”) determination that a unit \n8 \n9  involving both professional and non-professional employees was appropriate for \n10 \ncollective bargaining purposes was in excess of delegated powers because it was in direct \n11 \nconflict with the provisions of § 9(b)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) \n12 \n13  dictating that it “shall not” do so “unless a majority of such professional employees vote \n14 \nfor inclusion in such unit.”  Kyne, 358 U.S. at 185.  Consequently, the district court had \n15 \njurisdiction to set aside a certification of the NLRB where that agency had refused to poll \n16 \n17  professional employees before combining them in a bargaining unit with non-\n18 \nprofessional employees.  Id. at 188-89.  In the ordinary case, a decision certifying a \n19 \nbargaining unit is not a final order that can be reviewed but the Court explained that first, \n20 \n21  the “suit [was] not one to ‘review,’ in the sense of that term as used in the Act, a decision \n22 \nof the Board made within its jurisdiction.  Rather, it [was] one to strike down an order of \n23 \nthe Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n11 Plaintiffs note that the ability to bring an ultra vires claim was first recognized by the Supreme Court \n27  decades earlier in American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902).   \n22 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1957   Page 23 of 101\n \n1  the Act.”  Id. at 188.  Second, because, in the ordinary case, only an employer can initiate \n2 \nan unfair labor practice charge, and ultimately a reviewable final order, by refusing to \n3 \nbargain after an election, the aggrieved employees in this case had “no other means, \n4 \n5  within their control . . . to protect and enforce” their statutory rights.  Id. at 190.  In other \n6 \nwords, “absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts would mean a sacrifice or \n7 \nobliteration of a right which Congress has given professional employees.”  Id.  In \n8 \n9  conclusion, the Court stated it “cannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial \n10 \nprotection of rights it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated powers.”  \n11 \nId.  \n12 \n13    MCorp Fin., Inc., relied on by Defendants, involved an express bar on judicial \n14 \nreview, and the Court found the Fifth Circuit erred when it held that it had jurisdiction to \n15 \nconsider the merits of MCorp’s challenge to the Board of Governors of the Federal \n16 \n17  Reserve System (“Board”) and held that the Financial Institutional Supervisory Act’s \n18 \n(“FISA”) preclusion provision barred judicial review of pending Board administrative \n19 \nactions.  MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. at 43-44. \n20 \n21    In its analysis, the Court distinguished its ruling from Kyne noting two differences.  \n22 \nFirst, the Court noted that “central” to its decision in Kyne was “the fact that the Board’s \n23 \ninterpretation of the Act would wholly deprive the union of a meaningful and adequate \n24 \n25  means of vindicating its statutory right.”  Id. at 43.  In MCorp. Fin., Inc., FISA provided \n26 \nMCorp with a meaningful and adequate opportunity for judicial review by challenging \n27 \n23 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1958   Page 24 of 101\n \n1  the Board’s findings.   Id. at 43-44.  Second, the Court emphasized “the clarity of the \n2 \ncongressional preclusion of review in FISA” where Congress clearly stated: “no court \n3 \nshall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of \n4 \n5  any [Board] notice or order under this section, or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, \n6 \nor set aside any such notice or order.”  Id. at 44 (quoting 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1)).  In \n7 \nKyne, the statutory provision implied, by its silence, a preclusion of review.  Id.  In \n8 \n9  contrast, FISA provides “clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to deny \n10 \nthe district court’s jurisdiction to review and enjoin the Board’s ongoing administrative \n11 \nproceedings.”  Id.   The Court reversed the decision by the Fifth Circuit and held that it \n12 \n13  did not have jurisdiction to consider MCorp’s challenge.  Id. at 44-45. \n14 \nNext, in Dart, relied on by Plaintiffs, the D.C. Circuit held that the Secretary of \n15 \nCommerce’s reversal of the administrative law judge’s decision exceeded his authority \n16 \n17  under the Export Administration Act (“EAA”).  Dart, 848 F.2d at 231.  The EAA \n18 \nprovides two finality clauses that certain “functions exercised under the Act” were \n19 \nexcluded from certain sections of the APA and the “Secretary shall, in a written order, \n20 \n21  affirm, modify, or vacate the decision of the administrative law judge.  The order of the \n22 \nSecretary shall be final and is not subject to judicial review.”  Id. at 221.  Because the \n23 \nSecretary did not “affirm, modify or vacate” the ALJ’s decision but instead reversed, it \n24 \n25  was not among the orders placed beyond review of the finality provision.  Id. at 227.  The \n26 \nD.C. Circuit held that review is available when the Secretary exercises functions that are \n27 \n24 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1959   Page 25 of 101\n \n1  not specified in the statute.  Id. at 221.  In explaining its ruling, it stated the even “where \n2 \nCongress is understood generally to have precluded review, the Supreme Court has found \n3 \nan implicit but narrow exception, closely paralleling the historic origins of judicial review \n4 \n5  for agency actions in excess of jurisdiction.”  Id.  The court’s analysis focused on the \n6 \nplain language of the statute, the structure of the statutory scheme, the legislative history, \n7 \nand the nature of the administrative action involved.  Id. at 224-27.  It concluded that the \n8 \n9  presumption of judicial review applied in that case, explaining that the finality clause did \n10 \nnot preclude judicial review of facial violations of the statute.  Id. at 222 (citing Kyne, \n11 \n358 U.S. 184).   \n12 \n13    The Dart court recognized that “[w]hen an executive acts ultra vires, courts are \n14 \nnormally available to reestablish the limits on his authority.”  Id. at 224.  However, the \n15 \ncourt noted that the “exception for review of facial violations should remain narrow.”   \n16 \n17  Id. at 231.  It also explained that “Congress’ finality clause must be given effect, and an \n18 \nagency action allegedly ‘in excess of authority’ must not simply involve a dispute over \n19 \nstatutory interpretation or challenged findings of fact.”  Id.  The court recognized that \n20 \n21  invoking the exception is “extraordinary” noting “that to justify such jurisdiction, there \n22 \nmust be a ‘specific provision of the Act which, although it is [ ]clear and mandatory, [ ]’ \n23 \nwas nevertheless violated.”  Id. (quoting Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer, 735 F.2d \n24 \n25  1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (citation omitted)).  The court in Dart concluded that the \n26 \n27 \n25 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1960   Page 26 of 101\n \n1  “requirement that the Secretary of Commerce ‘affirm, modify or vacate’ ALJ \n2 \nenforcement decisions was ‘clear and mandatory’ and was nevertheless violated.”  Id.  \n3 \n  The exception to the statutory bar on judicial review is an “extremely narrow one” \n4 \n5  and “extraordinary.”  Nat’l Air Traffic Controllers Ass’n AFL–CIO v. Fed. Serv. \n6 \nImpasses Panel, 437 F.3d 1256, 1263 (D.C. Cir. 2006); American Airlines, Inc. v. \n7 \nHerman, 176 F.3d 283, 293 (5th Cir. 1999) (courts “have interpreted Kyne as sanctioning \n8 \n9  [review] in a very narrow situation in which there is a ‘plain’ violation of an \n10 \nunambiguous and mandatory provision of the statute.”).  The D.C. Circuit described that \n11 \na Kyne claim is “essentially a Hail Mary pass—and in court as in football, the attempt \n12 \n13  rarely succeeds.”  Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. \n14 \nCir. 2009).   \n15 \n  In sum, in order for the Kyne exception to apply, a plaintiff must satisfy the \n16 \n17  following two factors: 1) that the agency acted “in excess of its delegated powers” \n18 \ncontrary to “clear and mandatory statutory language” and 2) “the party seeking review \n19 \nmust be ‘wholly deprive[d] . . . of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its \n20 \n21  statutory rights.”  Pac.

NLRB, 827 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th Cir. 2016) \n22 \n(citations omitted); Nat’l Air Traffic Controllers, 437 F.3d at 1263 (the Kyne exception \n23 \ncan apply to cases involving “either negative or positive statutory commands.”).  \n24 \n25    Courts have cautioned that “review of an ‘agency action allegedly in excess of \n26 \nauthority must not simply involve a dispute over statutory interpretation.’”  Herman, 176 \n27 \n26 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1961   Page 27 of 101\n \n1  F.3d at 293 (quoting Kirby Corp. v. Pena, 109 F.3d 258, 269 (5th Cir. 1997)); Dart, 848 \n2 \nF.2d at 231 (noting that facial challenges to agency action as allegedly “‘in excess of \n3 \nauthority’ must not simply involve a dispute over statutory interpretation or challenged \n4 \n5  findings of fact.”); see also Nebraska State Legislative Bd., United Transp. Union v. \n6 \nSlater, 245 F.3d 656, 659-60 (8th Cir. 2001).  For example, in Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. \n7 \nWeeks, 643 F. Supp. 2d 111 (D.D.C. 2009), the court explained that Health and Human \n8 \n9  Services (“HHS”) has the “authority under the Medicare statute to determine whether a \n10 \nproduct is a single source drug, a biological, or a multiple source drug.”  Id. at 115 n. 2.  \n11 \nWhether HHS made the correct determination about [the drug] is a “dispute over \n12 \n13  statutory interpretation” that does not rise to the level of an ultra vires claim.”  Id.    \n14 \n  Contrary to Defendants’ argument that the Court cannot even consider whether the \n15 \ntwo Waivers were ultra vires acts, courts have consistently conducted judicial review of \n16 \n17  facial, ultra vires claims despite a statutory bar on judicial review.12  See Lindahl v. OPM, \n18 \n470 U.S. 768, 789, 791 (1985) (statutory bar did not bar review of alleged errors of law \n19 \nor procedure but it did bar review of factual determinations); Dart, 848 F.2d at 225; \n20 \n21  Staacke v. U.S. Sec’y of Labor, 841 F.2d 278, 281 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting review is \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n12 The parties dispute the origins of ultra vires review.  Coalition Plaintiffs claim courts have inherent \n25 \nauthority to review ultra vires jurisdiction, (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 19; Dkt. No. 38 at 7), while Defendants \n26  argue that ultra vires review is an application of the rebuttable presumption of congressional intent in \nfavor of judicial review.  (Dkt. No. 35-1 at 35; Dkt. No. 42 at 20.)  A decision on the origins of ultra \n27  vires review is not dispositive and the Court declines to resolve this issue.   \n27 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1962   Page 28 of 101\n \n1  available “where defendant is charged with violating a clear statutory mandate or \n2 \nprohibition” even where a statute “absolutely bars judicial review”); Oestereich v. \n3 \nSelective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233 (1968) (despite an express \n4 \n5  preclusion of pre-induction review, the Court reversed the plaintiff’s draft classification); \n6 \nSpencer Enters., Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir. 2003) (courts retain \n7 \njurisdiction to review whether a particular decision of the Attorney General is ultra vires \n8 \n9  despite the discretion granted to the Attorney General).   \n10 \n  Even the cases relied upon by Defendants fail to support their position.  In Staacke, \n11 \nthe Ninth Circuit stated that on a claim that the defendant violated a clear statutory \n12 \n13  mandate or prohibition, the court may consider the claim despite a judicial bar but its \n14 \n“task is limited to determining whether the statute in question contains a clear command \n15 \nthat the Secretary has transgressed.”  Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282.  After determining there \n16 \n17  was no violation of a clear statutory mandate, the Ninth Circuit upheld the bar on judicial \n18 \nreview.  Id.  Similarly, in Gebhardt v. Nielson, 879 F.3d 980, 989 (9th Cir. 2018), the \n19 \nNinth Circuit affirmed a judgment of the district court, which dismissed an action based \n20 \n21  on a judicial bar on the Secretary’s discretion in making “no risk” determinations.  Id. at \n22 \n989.  The Secretary of DHS denied the plaintiff’s petitions for permanent resident status \n23 \nfiled on behalf of his wife and his wife’s three children pursuant to the Adam Walsh \n24 \n25  Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 based on the plaintiff’s prior state conviction for \n26 \ncommitting a “lewd and lascivious act with a child under the age of fourteen.”  Id. at 983-\n27 \n28 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1963   Page 29 of 101\n \n1  84.  The Ninth Circuit stated that it may review the plaintiff’s claims to the extent he \n2 \nchallenged the scope of the Secretary’s discretion.  Id.  After determining that the claimed \n3 \naction did not exceed the Secretary’s discretion, the Ninth Circuit, upheld the judicial bar \n4 \n5  on the Secretary’s discretionary “no risk” determination.  Id. at 5.  These cases \n6 \ndemonstrate that the Court may consider whether there has been a plain violation of an \n7 \nunambiguous and mandatory provision of law despite a statutory bar on judicial review.   \n8 \n9    The Court concludes that it may conduct judicial review of facial, ultra vires \n10 \nclaims despite a statutory bar on judicial review.  Accordingly, the Court next considers \n11 \nwhether the Secretaries acted in excess of their delegated powers.    \n12 \n13    D.  Whether the Waiver Determinations Are Ultra Vires Acts under Section \n14 \n102(c)’s Waiver Authority  \n15 \n  Defendants contend that the DHS Secretaries’ actions are ultra vires only if they \n16 \n17  are in excess of delegated powers that are contrary to “clear and mandatory” statutory \n18 \nlanguage as required in Kyne.13  Plaintiffs reply that the Kyne line of cases do not apply \n19 \nand, instead, the Dart test applies so that the government has the burden to show “clear \n20 \n21  and convincing” evidence that Congress foreclosed its jurisdiction over their case.  Dart, \n22 \n848 F.3d at 224.  However, Plaintiffs are confusing the standard that is required to \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26  13 A Ninth Circuit panel has also referred to the “clear and mandatory” standard as “unambiguous and \nmandatory” provision of a statute.  See Charlie Rossi Ford, Inc. v. Price, 564 F.2d 372, 373 (9th Cir. \n27  1977).  \n29 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1964   Page 30 of 101\n \n1  overcome the presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative \n2 \nactions, a “clear and convincing” standard, with the “clear and mandatory” statutory \n3 \nlanguage requirement for application of the Kyne exception to the statutory bar of \n4 \n5  judicial review.  In fact, the court in Dart applied the Kyne test when it held that the \n6 \nSecretary of Commerce facially violated a specific provision of the EAA which was \n7 \n“clear and mandatory.”  Dart, 848 F.2d at 231.  An agency’s action is ultra vires if it \n8 \n9  contravenes “clear and mandatory” statutory language.  Pac. Mar. Ass’n, 827 F.3d at \n10 \n1208 (quoting Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188); Dart, 848 F.2d at 231; Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281.  \n11 \nIn order to make that determination, courts look to the language of the statute and its \n12 \n13  legislative history.  See Int’l Ass’n of Tool Craftsmen v. Leedom, 276 F.2d 514, 516 \n14 \n(D.C. Cir. 1960) (“statutory language itself and the legislative history” support invoking \n15 \ndistrict court’s equity jurisdiction to consider whether Board violated a “clear and \n16 \n17  mandatory” statutory prohibition); Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Helpers and Delivery Drivers, \n18 \nLocal 690 v. NLRB, 375 F.2d 966, 971 (9th Cir. 1967) (a court looks to statutory text and \n19 \nlegislative history to determine if the Board violated a “clear and mandatory” statutory \n20 \n21  provision).  \n22 \nHere, in order for the narrow exception of Kyne to apply, Plaintiffs must show that \n23 \nSecretaries Kelly and Duke acted in excess of their delegated powers by showing that the \n24 \n25  issuance of the two Waiver Determinations was in contravention of “clear and \n26 \nmandatory” language contained in section 102.  See Pac. Mar. Ass’n, 827 F.3d at 1208; \n27 \n30 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1965   Page 31 of 101\n \n1  Dart, 848 F.2d at 222 (The question “whether an agency has acted ‘in excess of its \n2 \ndelegated powers’ has alternatively been phrased as whether the agency action ‘on its \n3 \nface’ violated a statute.”).   Plaintiffs must also show that barring judicial review would \n4 \n5  deprive them of a “meaningful and adequate means of vindicating [their] statutory \n6 \nrights.”  Id.  \n7 \n  1.  Violation of a “Clear and Mandatory” Statutory Provision    \n8 \n9    The Court now turns to whether Plaintiffs have established that the Secretaries \n10 \nfacially violated a specific provision of section 102 which was “clear and mandatory.”  .  \n11 \n    a.  Whether Section 102(c) Waiver Provision Applies Only to    \n12 \n13        Projects Identified in Section 102(b) \n14 \n  Plaintiffs argue that that the statutory authority to waive laws under section 102(c) \n15 \ndoes not apply to the two border wall projects because they were not specifically \n16 \n17  mandated by Congress under section 102(b).  Further, when construed as a whole, the \n18 \ntwo projects fall outside the limits of the waiver authority because Congress did not \n19 \nintend section 102(c) to apply to projects beyond those specifically mandated in section \n20 \n21  102(b). Defendants disagree arguing that the waiver provision applies to section 102 as a \n22 \nwhole, and is not limited to only Congress’ priorities identified in section 102(b).  Upon \n23 \nreview of the statute and legislative history, both interpretations are plausible.  As such, \n24 \n25  there is no violation of “clear and mandatory” language with respect to the application of \n26 \nthe waiver.    \n27 \n31 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1966   Page 32 of 101\n \n1    Statutory construction always begins with the “language of the statute itself” or \n2 \n“plain meaning of the statute” and if unambiguous, that meaning controls.  Brock v. \n3 \nWriters Guild of America, West, Inc., 762 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir. 1985); Transwestern \n4 \n5  Pipeline Co., LLC v. 17.19 Acres of Prop. Located in Maricopa Cnty., 627 F.3d 1268, \n6 \n1271 (9th Cir. 2010).  If the language is not clear, then a court looks at the legislative \n7 \nhistory.   Brock v. Writers Guild of America, West, Inc., 762 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir. \n8 \n9  1985); Avendano-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir. 2004).  Legislative \n10 \nhistory is also looked at if the statutory language is clear but there is “clearly expressed \n11 \nlegislative intention” which is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.  Heppner v. \n12 \n13  Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 665 F.2d 868, 871 (9th Cir. 1981).  \n14 \n  Section 102(c) states, \n15 \n(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of \n16 \nHomeland Security shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements \n17  such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, determines necessary to \nensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section. \n18 \nAny such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon being published \n19  in the Federal Register. \n \n20 \n8 U.S.C. § 1103(c) (emphasis added).   \n21 \n  Defendants argue that the words “under this section” refer to section 102 as a \n22 \n23  whole and are not limited to subsection 102(b).  This includes actions under any part of \n24 \nsection 102 that meet section 102(c)(1)’s criteria.  In support, they cite to the Guide to \n25 \nLegislative Drafting which explains that section 102(a) is a “subsection”; section \n26 \n27 \n32 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1967   Page 33 of 101\n \n1  102(b)(1) is a “paragraph” and section 102(b)(1)(A) is a “sub-paragraph.”  See House \n2 \nOffice of the Legislative Counsel, Guide to Legislative Drafting.  Therefore, “this \n3 \nsection” in section 102(c)(1) cannot be read to refer exclusively to 102(b) but applies to \n4 \n5  the entirety of section 102.   \n6 \nPlaintiffs respond that the waiver authority must be interpreted as limited to \n7 \nspecific border barriers specified in section 102(b) because Defendants’ reliance on the \n8 \n9  standardized format interpretation of “this section” is flawed.  They argue that \n10 \nDefendants’ position produces an absurd result in interpreting sections 102(b)(2)-(4).  \n11 \nThese sections address the procedures for obtaining easements and appropriations, and \n12 \n13  refer to and apply only to “this subsection” which is section 102(b).  According to \n14 \nDefendants’ interpretation, the procedures and directives regarding easements and \n15 \nappropriations would not apply to section 102(a) border projects and without those \n16 \n17  provisions, a border barrier could not be built.  Moreover, the terms “section” and \n18 \n“subsection” are used inconsistently as section 102(b)(1)(A) uses the phrase “[i]n \n19 \ncarrying out subsection (a)” while section 102(b)(1)(B) & (C) uses the phrase “[i]n \n20 \n21  carrying out this section” under section 102(b).   \n22 \n   Defendants reply that “when Congress identifies certain specific applications of a \n23 \ngeneral grant of authority, those specific requirements cannot generally be understood to \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n33 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1968   Page 34 of 101\n \n1  prohibit all other applications of the general authority.”  (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 30.14)  Second, \n2 \na reading that limits section 102(c) to section 102(b) would render section 102(a) \n3 \nsuperfluous.  Third, the subsequent amendments demonstrate that section 102(b)(1) \n4 \n5  merely identified Congress’ shifting priorities and specific areas for action.  Finally, \n6 \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot overcome the plain meaning of the statute by \n7 \npointing out that Congress, in passing section 102 in 1996 and the amendment to section \n8 \n9  102(c) in 2005, was primarily focused on portions of fencing near San Diego.  Congress \n10 \ncould have limited the provision to construction near San Diego; instead, it established a \n11 \nbroad general mandate in section 102(a) that is not geographically limited and used the \n12 \n13  words “under this section” to extend section 102(c) to the entire section.   \n14 \n  Certainly, section 102 is not a model of legislative precision.  Given the \n15 \ninconsistencies in the use of “this section”, the Court looks to the legislative history for \n16 \n17  further guidance.  The parties rely on the legislative history that supports their respective \n18 \npositions.  Defendants cite to Conference Report 109-72 to support their interpretation \n19 \nbecause the Report broadly states it “provides for construction and strengthening of \n20 \n21  barriers along U.S. land borders.”  (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. \n22 \n109-72 at p. 170 (May 3, 2005).  However, the Conference Report also references section \n23 \n102(b) as to the waiver’s application to the 14 miles of barriers and roads, mandated by \n24 \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  14 Pages numbers to the docket are based on the CM/ECF pagination. \n34 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1969   Page 35 of 101\n \n1  1996 IIRIRA along the border near San Diego that had been halted due to environmental \n2 \nchallenges.  Id.  \n3 \n  Defendants argue that the breadth of section 102(c) is noted by comments made by \n4 \n5  representatives who were opposed to the 2005 REAL ID Act which were not contradicted \n6 \nby its sponsors.

(See Dkt. No. 18-2, \n6 \nDs’ Index of Exs., Ex. 4, 142 Cong. Rec. H11076 (Sept. 25, 1996), (statement of Rep. \n7 \nSaxton) (“[Section 102(c)] is intended to address an issue that has to do with the \n8 \n9  California-Texas-Mexico border; however, the way this section is written, the exemption \n10 \napplies to the entire border of the United States, not just the California-Mexico border \n11 \nnear San Diego.”). \n12 \n13    On the other hand, Plaintiffs rely on the legislative history which shows the \n14 \nsponsor’s and supporters’ intent to limit the expanded waiver authority to the San Diego \n15 \nfencing under section 102(b).  The bill’s author, Representative Sensenbrenner, described \n16 \n17  the amendment as “the REAL ID Act will waive Federal laws to the extent necessary to \n18 \ncomplete gaps in the San Diego border security fence, which is still stymied 8 years after \n19 \ncongressional authorization.  Neither the public safety nor the environment are \n20 \n21  benefitting from the current stalemate.”  (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 6, 151 \n22 \nCong. Rec. H454 (Feb. 9, 2005).)  Supporters of the bill also made statements limiting \n23 \nthe amendment to the fence in San Diego.  (Id., 151 Cong. Rec. H453-471 (Feb. 9, 2005) \n24 \n25  (Statement of Rep.

It is the sponsors that we look to when the meaning of the \n6 \nstatutory words is in doubt.”  NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U.S. 58, 66 (1964) (citing \n7 \nSchwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394-95 (1951)).  “In their \n8 \n9  zeal to defeat a bill, they understandably tend to overstate its reach.”  Id.   In this case, \n10 \neven though the Court has looked at the sponsors’ comments to determine the meaning of \n11 \nthe statute, the sharp contrast in the legislative history statements and plausible \n12 \n13  interpretations on both sides do not provide the Court with definitive guidance as to the \n14 \nbreadth of section 102(c).  \n15 \n  Each side offers additional plausible interpretations to support their position.  For \n16 \n17  example, since 2005, the waiver provision has been invoked five times in order to comply \n18 \nwith the specific mandates of the various amendments to section 102(b).  See 70 Fed. \n19 \nReg. 55,622-02 (Sept. 22, 2005)15 (concerning completion of section 102(b) mandated in \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n15 In the 2005 waiver determination, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff noted that nine years had \n24 \npassed since Congress specifically sought the construction of 14 miles of building second and third \nfences to the existing reinforced fence under section 102(b).  Therefore, in order to expedite the \n25 \ncompletion of section 102(b) of IIRIRA, he invoked the waiver provision in section 102(c) for “all \n26  federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal requirements” related to the construction.  See 70 Fed. \nReg. 55,622-02 (Sept. 22, 2005). The impetus for broadening section 102(c) to all legal requirements \n27  was the lengthy delay caused by challenges made by environmental groups.   \n37 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1972   Page 38 of 101\n \n1  1996); 72 Fed. Reg. 2,535-01 (Jan. 19, 2007); 72 Fed. Reg. 60,870-01 (Oct. 26, 2007); 72 \n2 \nFed. Reg. 10,077-01 (Apr. 8, 2008); 72 Fed. Reg. 19078-01 (Apr. 8, 2008).  These \n3 \nwaivers indicate that their use was limited to the mandates of section 102(b).  However, \n4 \n5  Defendants point out that section 102(a)’s general mandate is broad and geographically \n6 \nincludes “the United States border.”  This was confirmed by a district court in Save Our \n7 \nHeritage where it concluded that even though Congress did not include San Diego when \n8 \n9  section 102(b) was amended by the 2006 Fence Act, the Secretary’s general authority to \n10 \nconstruct border barriers under section 102(a) is broad, does not include any geographical \n11 \nrestrictions and authorized the San Diego barrier project even though it was included in \n12 \n13  the prior version of section 102(b) of the 2005 REAL ID Act.  Save Our Heritage Org. v. \n14 \nGonzalez, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58, 61 (D.D.C. 2008).  Even though San Diego was included \n15 \nin section 102(b) in the REAL ID Act, the district court’s reasoning to conclude that the \n16 \n17  Secretary had authority to construct the San Diego barrier was based on the broad \n18 \nprovision of section 102(a), not because it was mandated in the prior version.  Id. \n19 \n  Plaintiffs also cite to Judge Burns’s decision in Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, Case No. \n20 \n21  04cv272-LAB(JMA), 2005 WL 8153059 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005) where the plaintiffs \n22 \nchallenged the Secretary’s waiver determination in September 2005 invoked pursuant to \n23 \nthe 2005 REAL ID Act for the border fence construction of the Triple Fence Project.  \n24 \n25  They note that the court repeatedly emphasized the limitation of the waiver to the \n26 \n“narrow purpose of expeditious completion of the Triple Fence authorized by the \n27 \n38 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1973   Page 39 of 101\n \n1  IIRIRA.”  Id. at 5.  However, Plaintiffs were challenging the waiver determination to \n2 \ncomplete the project that was specifically authorized in section 102(b), and therefore, the \n3 \nCourt’s language focused on section 102(b).  As such, the Sierra Club case is not as \n4 \n5  helpful as Plaintiffs propose. \n6 \n  The parties’ varying plausible interpretations concerning the scope of section \n7 \n102(c) demonstrate the lack of a clear statutory mandate.  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282 \n8 \n9  (“Where, as here, the statute is capable of two plausible interpretations, the Secretary’s \n10 \ndecision to adopt one interpretation over the other cannot constitute a violation of a clear \n11 \nstatutory mandate.”).  In view of the competing plausible interpretations, the Court \n12 \n13  cannot conclude that the Secretaries acted in excess of their delegated powers contrary to \n14 \na “clear and mandatory” provision in section 102.   \n15 \n    b.  Whether Key Statutory Terms Preclude the Waiver      \n16 \n17        Determinations  \n18 \n      i.  “additional barriers and roads”  \n19 \n  Section 102(a) grants the Secretary the authority to “to install additional physical \n20 \n21  barriers and roads.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a).  Coalition Plaintiffs and California Plaintiffs \n22 \nargue that section 102 only allows for the installation of “additional” barriers and roads \n23 \nand does not authorize the replacement of existing fences.  Plaintiffs cite to the dictionary \n24 \n25  that defines “additional” as “more”, “extra” and “added” while “replacement” is defined \n26 \nas resulting in no net gain or addition and because the new barrier is a substitute or \n27 \n39 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1974   Page 40 of 101\n \n1  successor to the fence, it is replacing, not adding.  Moreover, they argue that the \n2 \nconstruction of additional barriers through various amendments since 1996 focused solely \n3 \non adding mileage to the existing fencing such as adding fencing where none existed or \n4 \n5  adding new layers of fencing to supplement the existing primary fence.  Section 102 does \n6 \nnot address on-going maintenance or replacement of existing barriers.  They contend that \n7 \nnone of the prior waivers were initiated for the purpose of replacing, repairing, or \n8 \n9  enhancing existing barriers.  \n10 \nIn response, the government argues Plaintiffs’ narrow interpretation of “additional” \n11 \nis not supported by the statutory language nor the legislative history.  According to \n12 \n13  Defendants, the installation of “lighting, cameras and sensors”, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)(A), \n14 \nfalls under “additional barriers and roads” under section 102(a) which indicate a broader \n15 \ndefinition of “additional.”  Defendants also cite the legislative history of the 2005 REAL \n16 \n17  ID Act where representatives described section 102 as providing for “construction and \n18 \nstrengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders” suggesting a broad definition of \n19 \n“additional.”  (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, \n20 \n21  2005).)  In 2006, Senator Kyl discussed section 102 and explained the project as \n22 \n“replacing the so-called landing mat fencing, which does look like a wall, with chain \n23 \nlink-type fencing that you can see through.”  (Dkt. No. 18-2, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 9, \n24 \n25  152 Cong. Rec. S9871 (Sept. 21, 2006).)  He explained that the current fencing is \n26 \ndeteriorating and difficult to repair because of its age.

No. 42-2, Ds’ Index of \n3 \nExs., Ex. 23.)  The authority for the project was derived from sections 102(a) and \n4 \n5  102(b)(1)(A).  (Id. at 5.)  The Nogales Fence Replacement Project was to remove and \n6 \nreplace about 2.8 miles of existing primary fence along the United States/Mexico \n7 \ninternational border, the repair and maintenance of a 20 foot wide construction road \n8 \n9  parallel to the fence and replacement of a 20-foot-wide gate at a port of entry.  (Id. at 4.)    \n10 \n  The legislative history and the prior projects invoking section 102(c) for the \n11 \nreplacement of border fences support the position that building “additional barriers” has a \n12 \n13  broad meaning and can include replacement of fencing.  To the extent that this \n14 \ninterpretation is plausible, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the replacement fence clearly \n15 \nfalls outside the scope of “additional physical barriers” to show that the Secretary \n16 \n17  violated a “clear and mandatory” statutory provision.  See, e.g., Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281 \n18 \n(noting that both parties’ construction of “in addition” were plausible where one party \n19 \nasserted it meant “concurrent with” and the other party maintained it meant “subsequent \n20 \n21  to”).   \n22 \n/// \n23 \n/// \n24 \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  16 73 Fed.

Moreover, sector wide data are not reliable because the amount of drugs \n7 \nseized in a sector usually occur far from the Mexican border at highway checkpoints, \n8 \n9  during vehicle searches at the points of entry or when border patrol agents discover a \n10 \ndrug-smuggling boat or drone.  Sector wide data do not demonstrate that the project areas \n11 \nthemselves are areas of high illegal entry and the data are less probative when the facts \n12 \n13  show that the San Diego Project Area has fewer illegal border crossings than the San \n14 \nDiego Sector as a whole.  However, even if the Court were to consider sector-wide data, \n15 \nPlaintiffs argue DHS’s apprehension records show that these two sectors are no longer \n16 \n17  areas of high illegal entry.    \n18 \n  Defendants argue that Congress has set no specific threshold for “high illegal \n19 \nentry” but Congress has expressly stated that one of the statute’s purposes is “to achieve \n20 \n21  and maintain operational control over the international border.”  8 U.S.C. § \n22 \n1103(b)(1)(D).  “Operational control” “means the prevention of all unlawful entries into \n23 \nthe United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of \n24 \n25  terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.”  Pub. L. No. 109-367 § 2(b), 120 Stat. 2638 \n26 \n(2006) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1701 note).  Moreover, they note that the number of \n27 \n42 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1977   Page 43 of 101\n \n1  apprehensions had fallen from more than 480,000 to less than 150,000 by 2006.  But \n2 \nwhen Congress amended section 102 in 2006 and 2008, it did not suggest there was no \n3 \nlonger “high illegal entry” along the border.  Lastly, Congress frequently refers to sector-\n4 \n5  wide data when discussing the needs for such projects; therefore the use of sector-wide \n6 \ndata is not misplaced.  (Dkt. No. 35-1 at 65 (citation to legislative history using sector-\n7 \nwide data).)     \n8 \n9    The August 2, 2017 Waiver Determination states that the San Diego Sector is one \n10 \nof the busiest and in 2016, the CBP apprehended over 31,000 illegal aliens and seized \n11 \nabout 9,167 pounds of marijuana and about 1,317 pounds of cocaine in the San Diego \n12 \n13  Sector.  (Dkt. No. 30-6, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. 35984.)  Based on this, the \n14 \nSecretary determined that the San Diego Project Area, “is an area of high illegal entry.”  \n15 \n(Id. at 35985.)  The September 12, 2017 Waiver Determination states that the El Centro \n16 \n17  Sector is an area of high illegal entry.  (Id., Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. 42,830.)  In 2016, the \n18 \nCPB apprehended over 19,000 illegal aliens and seized about 2,900 pounds of marijuana \n19 \nand about 126 pounds of cocaine.  (Id.)   \n20 \n21  Congress did not define “area of high illegal entry” so as to provide “clear and \n22 \nmandatory” metrics.  Similarly, the government’s use of sector wide data to support its \n23 \n“area of high illegal entry” determination is not a clear violation of the statute.  See Key \n24 \n25  Med. Supply, Inc. v. Burwell, 764 F.3d 955, 964 (8th Cir. 2014) (Congress did not \n26 \ninstruct the Agency as to how to ensure or achieve category-wide cost savings and the \n27 \n43 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1978   Page 44 of 101\n \n1  use of pre-existing scheduled prices as maximum bid caps was not “a clear departure \n2 \nfrom [the] statutory mandate”).  As a result, the Court cannot conclude the Secretaries \n3 \nviolated their mandate to deter crossings in areas of “high illegal entry” when they \n4 \n5  determined that apprehension of 31,000 undocumented aliens in the San Diego Sector in \n6 \n2016, and 19,000 apprehended illegal entries in El Centro Sector in 2016 “remain[] \n7 \narea[s] of high illegal entry.”  (Dkt. No. 30-6, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. \n8 \n9  35984; id., Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. 42,830.) \n10 \n  The parties present certain facts and data in varying forms, based on geographic \n11 \nlocations or years, to support their respective positions.  Plaintiffs focus on the dramatic \n12 \n13  improvement over the years on the number of apprehensions.  Again, the Court finds that \n14 \nboth sides offer conflicting plausible interpretations of section 102(a).  As a result, the \n15 \nSecretary’s decision to adopt one interpretation over the other cannot constitute an ultra \n16 \n17  vires act.   \n18 \n      iii.  “deter illegal crossings” \n19 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs contend that the border wall prototype project, to evaluate \n20 \n21  various design features for potential inclusion in a future border wall, is outside the scope \n22 \nof section 102 because it has no deterrent effect since there are gaps between each of the \n23 \neight prototypes built.  They also contend that DHS has already spent more than $2 \n24 \n25  billion to install 705 miles of fencing along the border and the two projects are not \n26 \n“necessary . . . to deter illegal crossings.”  (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 17.)  The government argues \n27 \n44 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1979   Page 45 of 101\n \n1  that Coalition Plaintiffs cannot second-guess the Secretary’s conclusion that the projects \n2 \n“will further Border Patrol’s ability to deter and prevent illegal crossings.”  (Dkt. No. 35-\n3 \n1 at 66.)  \n4 \n5    Section 102(a) provides that the Secretary must take actions “necessary to install \n6 \nadditional physical barriers and roads” . . . “to deter illegal crossings.”  8 U.S.C. § \n7 \n1103(a).  In the Waiver Determinations, the Secretaries determined that the prototypes \n8 \n9  are “intended to deter illegal crossings” and “necessary for future border wall design and \n10 \nconstruction.”  (Dkt. No. 30-6, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. at 35,985, id., Ex. 12, \n11 \n82 Fed. Reg. at 42,830.)   \n12 \n13    Once again, the issue of what constitutes “deter[ing] illegal crossings” comes down \n14 \nto statutory interpretation.  The Secretary is granted broad discretion in determining how \n15 \nto “achieve and maintain operational control” of the border.  Plaintiffs have not identified \n16 \n17  “clear and mandatory” statutory language that the Secretary violated to establish the \n18 \nclaimed ultra vires conduct.   \n19 \n    iv.  “most practical and effective” \n20 \n21    California Plaintiffs argue that Defendants exceeded their authority by constructing \n22 \nfencing where the barriers would not be “most practical or effective.”  See 8 U.S.C. § \n23 \n1103(b)(1)(A).  The facts show that the project area sites are no longer high priority sites.  \n24 \n25  According to a CBP document, the California border was rated as “moderate” compared \n26 \nto “high” or “very high” when it came to geographic/investment priorities.  (Dkt. No. 30-\n27 \n45 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1980   Page 46 of 101\n \n1  5, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 9 at 45.)  Moreover, in a television interview, Secretary of DHS \n2 \nKelly stated that the existing fencing is “very, very effective” and “remarkably effective \n3 \nin keeping down the amount of illegal movements across” the border.  California \n4 \n5  Plaintiffs argue that most of California’s 140 miles border already has fencing including \n6 \nthe Project Areas covered by the Waivers.  (Dkt. No. 30-4, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 1 at 10-\n7 \n14.)   \n8 \n9    Defendants respond that the Secretary’s decision to assess where fencing “would \n10 \nbe most practical and effective”, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)(A), did not limit the broad \n11 \nmandate of section 102(a).  Moreover, section 102 also provides that the Secretary is to \n12 \n13  determine whether the “use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate \n14 \nmeans to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border.”  8 \n15 \nU.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)(D).  They also argue that the facts to support Plaintiffs’ conclusions \n16 \n17  are misplaced as the CBP document relied upon was dated March 27, 2017 which was \n18 \nfive months prior to the Secretary’s first waiver determination.  Also, Secretary Kelly’s \n19 \ncomments did not specifically address the San Diego Sector or El Centro Sector.  \n20 \n21    The Secretary of DHS has discretion to determine “where fencing would be the \n22 \nmost practical and effective” and California Plaintiffs’ facts do not demonstrate that the \n23 \nSecretary contravened a “clear and mandatory” provision in the statute.   \n24 \n25  /// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n46 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1981   Page 47 of 101\n \n1        v.  “consultation” \n2 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs argue that the waiver is unavailable unless the Secretary has \n3 \nconsulted with the parties identified in section 102(b)(1)(C) which she has not done.  \n4 \n5  Defendants argue that the waiver provision does not expressly or implicitly depend on the \n6 \ncompletion of the consultation requirement.  Nonetheless, Defendants assert that they \n7 \nhave and are still in the process of complying with the consultation provision.   \n8 \n9    Based on the parties’ briefing and arguments at the hearing, it did not appear that \n10 \nthe Secretary had complied with the consultation provision as to the border wall \n11 \nprototype project and the evidence provided did not support compliance with the \n12 \n13  consultation provision regarding the two replacement fences.  Therefore, at the hearing, \n14 \nthe Court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the consultation issue and \n15 \nhow the lack of consultation affects ultra vires and the constitutional claims, if at all.17   \n16 \n17    The consultation provision states, “[i]n carrying out this section, the Secretary of \n18 \nHomeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n19 \nAgriculture, States, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners in the United \n20 \n21  States to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, and quality of life \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25 \n17 Defendants note and the Court recognizes that that Coalition Plaintiffs are the only plaintiffs to have \n26  raised the consultation issue in their summary judgment motion.  To the extent all Plaintiffs raise similar \narguments in their supplemental briefs, the Court considers them.   \n27   \n47 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1982   Page 48 of 101\n \n1  for the communities and residents located near the sites at which such fencing is to be \n2 \nconstructed.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)(C).  This provision is mandatory.   \n3 \n  According to Real Estate and Environmental Branch Chief for the Border Patrol \n4 \n5  and Air and Marine Program Management Office (“BPAM”)18, an office within the CBP, \n6 \nthe prototype project began on September 26, 2017 and was completed on October 26, \n7 \n2017.  (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. ¶ 11.)  The prototype \n8 \n9  project area is located on Federal government property and used as an enforcement zone \n10 \nfor border security purposes and is heavily disturbed.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  CBP did not meet with \n11 \nUSDA, the State of California, local government or Indian Tribes as it determined they \n12 \n13  were not stakeholders.  (Id.)  However, CBP met with one adjacent landowner and in \n14 \nresponse to the landowner’s concerns, installed temporary fencing to prevent \n15 \nunauthorized construction access across the landowner’s property.  (Id.)  Prior to the San \n16 \n17  Diego Waiver, on July 13, 2017, CBP met with U.S. Department of Interior, (“DOI”), \n18 \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (“USFWS”), and Bureau of Land Management \n19 \n(“BLM”)’s staff, toured the project area and discussed potential environmental impacts.  \n20 \n21  (Id. ¶ 16.)  Before the waiver, CBP also met with General Service Administration \n22 \n(“GSA”) to discuss potential environmental impacts and routing of construction traffic as \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26  18 The BPAM is responsible for constructing and maintaining facilities, tactical infrastructure and border \ninfrastructure which also includes environmental planning and compliance associated with these \n27  activities.

(Id. ¶ 17.)  CBP also conducted a field \n2 \nsurvey concerning natural and biological resources and the results are summarized in a \n3 \nfinal Biological Resources Survey Report dated October 2017.  (Dkt. No. 49-5, Ds’ Index \n4 \n5  of Exs., Ex. 31.A, Enriquez Decl., Ex. A.)  It also conducted a field survey and records \n6 \nsearch to identify any cultural and historical resources in the project area and the results \n7 \nare summarized in a final Cultural Resources Survey Report dated October 2017.  (Dkt. \n8 \n9  No. 49-6, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31.B, Enriquez Decl., Ex. B.)  After the surveys were \n10 \ncompleted, CBP conducted additional consultation with DOI.  (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds’ Index \n11 \nof Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. ¶ 19.)  In September 2017, CBP sent USFWS the results \n12 \n13  of the biological survey and asked for input from USFWS concerning potential impacts \n14 \nfrom the project but no response was provided.  (Id.)  Based on the resource surveys, \n15 \nCBP prepared a Memorandum for the Record (“MFR”) dated September 25, 2017 \n16 \n17  analyzing the potential environmental impacts.  (Id. ¶ 21; Dkt. No. 49-7, Ds’ Index of \n18 \nExs., Ex. 31.C, Enriquez Decl., Ex. C.)  The Memorandum concluded that the prototype \n19 \nproject would have no impact on cultural or historic resources and would not have a \n20 \n21  significant impact on any endangered species as there are no threatened and endangered \n22 \nspecies in the project area, and no vernal pools, wetlands, or other surface water located \n23 \nwithin the project area.  (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. ¶ 22.)  \n24 \n25  Further, CBP mandated its contractors to follow certain Best Management Practices \n26 \n27 \n49 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1984   Page 50 of 101\n \n1  (“BMPs”).  (Id. ¶ 23.)  CBP made adjustments to the prototype project based on the \n2 \nresults of the resource surveys and consultation with stakeholders.  (Id. ¶ 20.)   \n3 \n  The Calexico fence replacement project is located primarily on federal land that is \n4 \n5  managed by CBP or GSA and used primarily for border enforcement or port operations.  \n6 \n(Id. ¶ 37.)  The project also includes a Media and First Amendment area on land owned \n7 \nby the City of Calexico.  (Id.)   \n8 \n9    Prior to the Calexico Waiver Determination, on July 13, 2017, CBP met with DOI \n10 \nrepresentatives including USFWS and BLM to provide information to them, (id. ¶ 38), \n11 \nand consulted with the California State Historic Preservation Officer (“CASHPO”) and \n12 \n13  Native American Tribes to make sure the geo-technical testing did not impact historic or \n14 \ncultural resources.  (Id. ¶ 39.)   \n15 \n  After the Waiver Determination, CBP conducted field surveys to identify natural \n16 \n17  and biological resources which were summarized in a Biological Survey Report dated \n18 \nJanuary 2018, (Dkt. No. 49-9, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31.E, Enriquez Decl., Ex.

No. 49-10, Ds’ Index of Exs., \n22 \nEx. 31.F, Enriquez Decl., Ex.

No. 49-11, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31.G, \n26 \nEnriquez Decl., Ex. G.)  After the surveys were completed, CBP conducted additional \n27 \n50 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1985   Page 51 of 101\n \n1  outreach and sent consultation letters, on January 18 and 19, 2018, to USFWS, the \n2 \nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife, CASHPO, two Native American tribes, the \n3 \nColorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control Board (“CRBRWQCB”), the U.S. \n4 \n5  Army Corps of Engineers Regulatory Division (“USACE”), the Imperial Irrigation \n6 \nDistrict (“IID”), Imperial County Air Pollution Control District, and the City of Calexico.  \n7 \n(Dkt.

To date, CBP received responses \n10 \nfrom three entities, IID, CRBRWQCB, and USACE.  (Dkt. No. 49-13, Ds’ Index of Exs., \n11 \nEx. 31.R-T, Enriquez Decl., Exs. R-T.)  The CBP concluded that the USDA and private \n12 \n13  property owners were not stakeholders in the Calexico replacement fence project.  (Id.)  \n14 \nBased on this information, CBP prepared the Calexico MFR.  (Dkt. No. 49-8, Ds’ Index \n15 \nof Exs., Ex. 31.D, Enriquez Decl., Ex. D.)   \n16 \n17    The San Diego fence replacement project will occur on federal land.  (Dkt. No. 49-\n18 \n4, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. ¶ 26.)  On July 13, 2017, prior to the Waiver, \n19 \nCBP conducted an on-site meeting with DOI, USFWS and BLM officials to discuss the \n20 \n21  project, and USFWS provided CPB with data and information concerning vernal pools \n22 \nand areas occupied by burrowing owls and the possible presence of habitat for the quino \n23 \ncheckerspot butterfly and the California gnatcatcher.  (Id. ¶ 27.)   \n24 \n25    CBP has conducted resource surveys, including biological, cultural and wetlands \n26 \nwithin the project area and is currently preparing these reports.  (Id. ¶ 28.)  Based on \n27 \n51 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1986   Page 52 of 101\n \n1  these surveys, CBP has made adjustments to the San Diego fence replacement project.  \n2 \n(Id. ¶ 29.)  For example, CBP identified two historic sites that will be avoided during \n3 \nconstruction and is planning on plant and topsoil salvage and making arrangements to \n4 \n5  have full time environmental and historic/cultural monitors on-site during construction.  \n6 \n(Id.)  Prior to the start of construction, CBP will send out letters to stakeholders including \n7 \nFederal, State, and local agencies and Native Americans in the Spring of 2018 to solicit \n8 \n9  more information.  (Id. ¶ 30.)  Once that is completed, it will prepare an Environmental \n10 \nStewardship Plan (“ESP”) for public review which will include its assessment of \n11 \npotential impacts, BMP’s, and if necessary, mitigation or conservation measures.  (Id.)   \n12 \n13  Because of the project’s location, CBP determined that the USDA and private property \n14 \nowners “are not likely to be stakeholders for this project.”  (Id. ¶ 31.)    \n15 \n  Consistent with Defendants’ prior argument that “carrying out this section” applies \n16 \n17  to section 102 as a whole, the Court concludes that the consultation provision applies to \n18 \nany border construction project under section 102.   \n19 \n  As to the prototype project, it appears that the consultation requirement was met.  \n20 \n21  Prior to the Waiver Determinations, CBP met with representatives of the DOI, including \n22 \nUSFWS and BLM, as well as GSA, as these are agencies that would be affected by the \n23 \nproject.  (Dkt. No. 49-4, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. 31, Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ 16, 17.)  They also \n24 \n25  met with one landowner but it is not clear when that occurred; however, CBP responded \n26 \n27 \n52 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1987   Page 53 of 101\n \n1  by installing temporary fencing due to the landowner’s concern.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Defendants \n2 \ndid not believe that any other agencies would be affected by the prototype project.  (Id.)   \n3 \n  Next, as to the Calexico replacement fence which may have begun construction on \n4 \n5  February 15, 2018, the CBP met with representatives of DOI, including USFWS and \n6 \nBLM, as well as the CASHPO and Native American tribes before the Waiver \n7 \nDetermination.  (Id. ¶¶ 38, 39.)  But it did not consult with the City of Calexico prior to \n8 \n9  the Waiver Determination.  Instead, it sent a consultation letter on January 19, 2018 with \n10 \na requested response date by February 2, 2018.  (Dkt. No. 49-12, Ds’ Index of Exs., Ex. \n11 \n31.O, Enriquez Decl., Ex. O at 15.)  It also sent consultation letters to nine additional \n12 \n13  identified stakeholders.  (Id., Exs. H-Q.)  To date, only three entities responded with one \n14 \nentity seeking additional time.  (Id., Exs. R-T.)  While the consultation letters were sent \n15 \nless than a month before construction is to begin, it is not clear that the consultation \n16 \n17  provision was violated.   \n18 \n  As to the San Diego replacement project, so far, CBP had a meeting with \n19 \nrepresentatives of DOI, USFWS and BLM, prior to the Waiver Determination and \n20 \n21  subsequently conducted surveys but has not yet consulted with other stakeholders.   \n22 \n  Plaintiffs argue that the consultation should occur prior to any waiver \n23 \ndeterminations as that information is critical in determining whether to waive certain \n24 \n25  laws.  In contrast, Defendants argue the consultation provision does not expressly specify \n26 \nthe subject matter for consultation, when the consultation should happen, or the degree of \n27 \n53 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1988   Page 54 of 101\n \n1  consultation required.  Its purpose is to minimize the impact of construction once a \n2 \nproject has been selected.  They also assert Congress intended the consultation provision \n3 \nto be enforced through its appropriations power but then note that for the appropriations \n4 \n5  for the projects at issue, Pub. L. No. 115-31, 131 Stat. 135, 434 (May 5, 2017), Congress \n6 \ndid not require consultation.  They further claim that the saving clause precludes a private \n7 \nright of action concerning the consultation requirement.    \n8 \n9    Plaintiffs’ argument that the consultation should occur prior to any waiver \n10 \ndeterminations so that the Secretary is fully informed when the determination is made is \n11 \nlogical.  In addition, it makes sense that consultation should occur before contracts are \n12 \n13  drafted and executed so that the information can have a practical influence on the \n14 \ndecision making process and to permit environmental and mitigation measures to be \n15 \nincorporated into the contract.  The question is whether such timing is mandatory.  \n16 \n17  Section 102 does not provide any specific limitation or guidance concerning when or how \n18 \nconsultation is to occur except expressly stating who shall be consulted.   \n19 \nConsultation on the Calexico replacement wall is on-going and responses may be \n20 \n21  forthcoming despite the fact that construction on the project may have already begun.  In \n22 \nthe Court’s opinion, the belated contact with stakeholders reduces the practical benefit of \n23 \nthe consultation process.  But given the lack of a “clear and mandatory” mandate \n24 \n25  regarding the timing of consultation, the Court cannot conclude that the Secretaries acted \n26 \n27 \n54 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1989   Page 55 of 101\n \n1  in excess of their delegated powers by approving the waivers or executing construction \n2 \ncontracts prior to completing the consultation process.     \n3 \n      vi.  “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” \n4 \n5    Section 102(c) provides that the Secretary of the DHS “shall have the authority to \n6 \nwaive all legal requirements” that the Secretary, in his or her “sole discretion” determines \n7 \n“necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \n8 \n9  section.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1).  This mandatory language gives the Secretary of the \n10 \nDHS discretion to make this determination.   \n11 \nCoalition Plaintiffs argue that section 102(c)’s waiver is subject to the Secretary’s \n12 \n13  determination that it is “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and \n14 \nroads under this section”, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1), but the government has failed to provide \n15 \nany information or bases to support the conclusion that these waivers are necessary.  \n16 \n17  Meanwhile, Center Plaintiff contends that section 102(c)’s requirement that waivers be \n18 \n“necessary to ensure expeditious construction” demonstrates that Congress intended to \n19 \nlimit the scope of the section 102(c) waiver to specific border barriers under section \n20 \n21  102(b).  They contend that a logical interpretation of “expeditious construction” is that \n22 \nCongress provided the DHS Secretary with the authority to waive laws in order to build \n23 \nthe specific border barriers required under section 102(b) as soon as possible after the \n24 \n25  law’s enactment and not to the wall replacement project or the prototype project started a \n26 \ndecade later.  Also, the text of the statute indicates that the waiver authority was intended \n27 \n55 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1990   Page 56 of 101\n \n1  to apply only for specific projects mandated by section 102(b) which have long been \n2 \ncompleted.     \n3 \n  Here, the words used by Plaintiffs in their argument such as “logical interpretation” \n4 \n5  “intended” and “[i[t is far more reasonable to limit the 102(c) waiver authority to those \n6 \nbarriers that have been specifically mandated by Congress under §102(b) than to adopt \n7 \nthe government’s boundless interpretation”, (Dkt. No. 28-1 at 39), demonstrate that a \n8 \n9  determination that a waiver is “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers \n10 \nand roads” is one of statutory interpretation.  The Court cannot conclude that the Waiver \n11 \nDeterminations are in contravention of clear and mandatory language in section 102(c).   \n12 \n13  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 282 (where the statute is subject to two plausible interpretations, \n14 \nthe Secretary of Labor’s interpretation cannot constitute a “violation of a clear mandatory \n15 \nmandate” and noting that the Secretary’s statutory discretion to make policy choices with \n16 \n17  disability decisions is “virtually limitless”).    \n18 \n  c.  Whether Section 102(c)’s Waiver Authority has Expired \n19 \n  Center Plaintiff argues that there is no evidence in the text or the legislative history \n20 \n21  that Congress intended the waiver authority to exist in perpetuity or even that Congress \n22 \nintended the waiver authority to be extended beyond the initial San Diego fence.  They \n23 \nargue that expeditious construction refers solely to section 102(b) projects as there are \n24 \n25  time constraints limiting DHS’s authority to determine “other mileage” to expire on \n26 \nDecember 31, 2008.  California Plaintiffs similarly argue that the 2008 amendment \n27 \n56 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1991   Page 57 of 101\n \n1  imposed deadlines for the expedited construction of fencing in priority areas.  In 2008, \n2 \nformer Secretary of DHS Chertoff identified more than 370 miles of priority areas and by \n3 \nApril 2013, DHS reported it had completed all but a one-mile stretch of these projects \n4 \n5  which involved 705 miles of fencing.  (Dkt. No. 30-4, Cayaban Decl, Ex. 5; id., Ex. 6.)     \n6 \n  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ argument that the December 31, 2008 deadline \n7 \nin section 102(b)(1)(B) applies generally to section 102(c) or section 102 as a whole is \n8 \n9  implausible.  Nothing in the statute demonstrates that Congress intended the waiver \n10 \nauthority to sunset and that expeditious construction is limited to section 102(b).  When \n11 \nCongress amended section 102(b) in December 2007, it mandated that about half of the \n12 \n13  “not less than 700 miles” be completed within a year, by December 31, 2008.  Because \n14 \nCongress did not provide a deadline for the remaining miles, they argue that there is no \n15 \nexpiration date on building additional fencing.  Moreover, they assert that the section \n16 \n17  102(c) waivers would be applicable to the remaining miles to be built.   \n18 \n  In 2008, Congress amended section 102(b) requiring DHS to construct reinforced \n19 \nfencing “along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be \n20 \n21  most practical and effect.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)(A).  As to priority areas, section 102(b) \n22 \nmandated that the DHS Secretary “identify 370 miles, or other mileage determined by the \n23 \nSecretary” and the authority to determine “other mileage” would expire on December 31, \n24 \n25  2008 and Congress imposed a deadline of December 31, 2008 to complete construction \n26 \nof the fencing.  Id. § 1103(b)(1)(B).   \n27 \n57 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1992   Page 58 of 101\n \n1    In United States v. Arizona, No. CV 10-1413-PHX-SRB, 2011 WL 13137062, at \n2 \n*8 (D. Az. Oct. 21, 2011), the district court addressed section 102(b)(1)(A)’s mandate \n3 \ndirecting the Secretary to construct 700 miles of fencing.  In that decision, the district \n4 \n5  court stated that there are no deadlines requiring completion of the fencing and \n6 \ninfrastructure projects by a specific time.  Id. at 8.  It explained that section 102 uses \n7 \nmandatory language but grants the Secretary “substantial discretion” in determining \n8 \n9  “how, when, and where to complete the construction.”  Id.  \n10 \n  This argument is similar to Plaintiffs’ earlier argument that section 102(c)’s waiver \n11 \nprovision applies only to projects identified in section 102(b) which was previously \n12 \n13  rejected by the Court.  The parties’ varying plausible interpretations concerning the scope \n14 \nof section 102(c) demonstrate that the statutory language is not clear and unambiguous \n15 \nand the parties’ argument is essentially a dispute regarding statutory interpretation.  As \n16 \n17  such, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Secretaries violated a clear and mandatory \n18 \nstatutory provision.   \n19 \n  d.  Whether Section 102 Requires that the Waiver Determinations     \n20 \n21      Include Findings \n22 \n  California Plaintiffs assert that the Waivers are invalid because the Secretaries \n23 \nfailed to make the requisite findings to demonstrate the requirements of section 102 and \n24 \n25  only used boiler plate language copied from section 102 without providing reasons \n26 \nbehind each Waiver Determination.  (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 34-35.)  Defendants respond that \n27 \n58 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1993   Page 59 of 101\n \n1  nothing in section 102(c) requires that the Secretaries explain the factual basis of their \n2 \nWaiver Determinations in the Federal Register.     \n3 \n  California Plaintiffs cite to Dickson v. Sec’y of Defense, 68 F.3d 1396, 1404-05 \n4 \n5  (D.C. Cir. 1995) and Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 967 \n6 \n(9th Cir. 2015) in support of their argument.  These cases involve agency determinations \n7 \nthat were found to be arbitrary and capricious under the APA where an agency failed to \n8 \n9  provide a reasoned explanation for its decision.  Unlike the current case, the challenged \n10 \nagency rulings in those cases were subject to judicial review.  In this case, the APA’s \n11 \nstandard of review and requirement for findings concerning an agency’s decision are \n12 \n13  inapplicable. \n14 \n  Section 102 only requires that the Secretary’s decision be “published in the Federal \n15 \nRegister.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1).  While the Waiver Determinations use predicate terms \n16 \n17  in section 102 such as “areas of high illegal entry”, “necessary”, “deter and prevent \n18 \nillegal crossings” and “most practical and effective”, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated \n19 \nthat more is mandated under section 102 to support an ultra vires claim.  Accordingly, the \n20 \n21  Court concludes that California Plaintiffs’ argument lacks merit.  \n22 \n  In view of the foregoing, the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the waivers \n23 \nviolated a clear and mandatory provision of section 102.  Consequently, the Court lacks \n24 \n25  jurisdiction to hear any non-constitutional claim.   \n26 \n27 \n59 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1994   Page 60 of 101\n \n1    2.   Whether Barring Review Deprives Plaintiffs of a Meaningful and   \n2 \n    Adequate Means of Violating Their Statutory Rights \n3 \n  The second step in an ultra vires analysis requires that Plaintiffs demonstrate that \n4 \n5  barring review would deprive them of a “meaningful and adequate means of vindicating” \n6 \ntheir statutory rights.  See MCorp., 502 U.S. at 43.  Analogizing to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n7 \ncases and private right of actions cases, Defendants argue that California Plaintiffs have \n8 \n9  not identified a statutory right in section 102 as opposed to a statutory obligation.  See \n10 \nCalifornia Sportfishing Prot. Alliance v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 15cv912 LJO \n11 \nBAM, 2015 WL 6167521, at *11 n. 8 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2014) (water quality standards \n12 \n13  are better described as “statutory obligations” rather than “statutory rights.”).   \n14 \nMeanwhile, no Plaintiff has conducted a meaningful analysis on this prong.  \n15 \nInstead, California Plaintiffs generally assert that the absence of district court jurisdiction \n16 \n17  will deprive them of adequate means to vindicate their statutory rights.  (Dkt. No. 30-2 at \n18 \n24.)  Assuming for argument’s sake that Plaintiffs satisfied the second prong, they have \n19 \nfailed to establish the first prong.  That is, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \n20 \n21  established a plain violation of an unambiguous and mandatory provision of section 102, \n22 \nand, therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional claims under section \n23 \n102(c)(2)(A).     \n24 \n25  /// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n60 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1995   Page 61 of 101\n \n1    E.   Whether the Secretaries’ Decisions under Sections 102(a) & (b) are \n2 \nSubject to APA Review \n3 \n  In order to invoke judicial review under the APA, Coalition Plaintiffs present an \n4 \n5  alternative argument starting with a strong presumption of judicial review of agency \n6 \naction.19  They argue that the judicial review limiting provision of section 102(c) is \n7 \ndistinct from sections 102(a) & (b) because the Secretary must comply with the \n8 \n9  requirements of sections 102(a) and (b) prior to invoking the waiver provision.  \n10 \nTherefore, because sections 102(a) and (b) are separate determinations from section \n11 \n102(c), and the waivers constitute final agency decisions reviewable by a district court, \n12 \n13  the Secretaries’ decisions on the two projects are subject to APA review and under the \n14 \nAPA, the two Waivers are “arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n15 \nnot in accordance with the law.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n16 \n17    Specifically, Coalition Plaintiffs contend that the language “notwithstanding any \n18 \nother provision of law” which is contained in section 102(c)(1) “demonstrates an intent to \n19 \nlimit the waiver authority solely to laws other than the one in which the waiver is \n20 \n21  contained, meaning the requirements of the section itself are not waivable.”  (Dkt. No. \n22 \n29-1 at 13.)  Accordingly, the requirement of “high illegal entry” and the “consultation” \n23 \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n19 In contrast, Center Plaintiff conceded that the strong presumption of judicial review is rebutted by the \n27  express statutory language of section 102(c).  (Dkt. No. 28-1 at 22.) \n61 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1996   Page 62 of 101\n \n1  requirements of sections 102(a) and (b) must be satisfied before the Secretary can invoke \n2 \nsection 102(c)’s waiver authority.   \n3 \n  Defendants counter that the section 102(c) waiver determination arises from “any \n4 \n5  action undertaken” pursuant to section 102(c)(1) and cannot be separated from sections \n6 \n102(a) or (b).  They contend that Plaintiffs improperly seek to challenge findings that are \n7 \nintegral to the waiver determination itself.  Even if the phrase “pursuant to paragraph (1)” \n8 \n9  in section 102(c)(2)(A), refers to the waiver determination in isolation, the terms “any \n10 \naction undertaken . . . pursuant to paragraph (1)” and “all clauses or claims arising from” \n11 \nsuch actions or decision, broadens the judicial review provision to include more than just \n12 \n13  the waiver determination, itself.  Next, they contend that Plaintiffs’ reading that provides \n14 \nsections 102(a) and (b) are subject to APA review would frustrate Congress’ purpose in \n15 \nenacting the jurisdictional limitation and waiver provisions which were intended to \n16 \n17  prevent litigation delays since any invocation of the waiver would be subject to APA \n18 \nreview to determine whether the waiver was justified in the first place.   \n19 \n  In reply, Coalition Plaintiffs argue that the Secretaries’ decisions under section \n20 \n21  102(c)(1) to waive any laws as “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” do not \n22 \naddress whether there is authority to construct the border projects themselves.  The \n23 \nauthority to construct the border projects are in sections 102(a) and (b).  They also argue \n24 \n25  that these decisions are final agency decisions as they mark the “consummation” of the \n26 \nagency’s decisionmaking and “alter[] the legal regime to which the action agency is \n27 \n62 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1997   Page 63 of 101\n \n1  subject”.  (Dkt. No. 38 at 13.)  “[S]ince subsections 102(a) and (b) are final agency \n2 \nactions and outside the scope of subparagraph 102(c)(2)(A), the Court may review these \n3 \nactions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).”  (Id.)   \n4 \n5    Under the APA, “[a] person suffering a legal wrong because of agency action, or \n6 \nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of the relevant \n7 \nstatute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Court are limited to \n8 \n9  review of a final agency action.  Or. Nat’l Desert Ass’n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 465 F.3d \n10 \n977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006).  Under the APA, the court determines whether the agency \n11 \nactions are “arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n12 \n13  However, judicial review is not available “to the extent that statutes preclude [it].”  5 \n14 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(1); see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 \n15 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)).   \n16 \n17    Section 102(c)(2)(A) provides that \n18 \nThe district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to \n19  hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision \nmade, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1).  A \n20 \ncause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the \n21  Constitution of the United States.  The court shall not have jurisdiction to \nhear any claim not specified in this subparagraph. \n22 \n \n23 \n8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(2)(A).  This is an express statutory bar on judicial review of non-\n24 \n25  constitutional claims and APA review is not allowed.  However, the question is whether \n26 \n27 \n63 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.1998   Page 64 of 101\n \n1  the express statutory bar applies solely to section 102(c) decisions or to the entirety of \n2 \nsection 102, including sections 102(a) and (b).   \n3 \n  The judicial review provision under section 102(c)(2)(A) states that the district \n4 \n5  courts have exclusive jurisdiction to “hear all causes or claims arising from any action \n6 \nundertaken”  . . . “pursuant to paragraph (1).”  While paragraph (1) refers to the \n7 \nSecretary’s waiver authority, the language “all causes or claims arising from any action \n8 \n9  undertaken” is broad enough to encompass the determination under section 102(a) that \n10 \nthe two projects are “necessary” to “deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry \n11 \ninto the United States.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); U.S. Dept. of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. \n12 \n13  607, 626 (1992) (describing “arising under Federal law” in the case as a “broad” and \n14 \n“seemingly expansive phrase”); Ford Ord Toxics Project, Inc. v. Cal.

The judicial review bar of non-constitutional challenges applies to any action \n4 \n5  taken to invoke the section 102(c) waiver authority which includes actions under sections \n6 \n102(a) and (b). \n7 \n  In conclusion, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions for summary judgment on \n8 \n9  non-constitutional claims alleging violations of NEPA, the ESA, the CZMA and the \n10 \nAPA, and DENIES Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on these claims.  Next, the \n11 \nCourt considers Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges which are subject to review by this \n12 \n13  Court.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(2)(A).  \n14 \n  F.  Constitutional Violations  \n15 \n  1.  Article I, Section 1 - Non-Delegation Doctrine & Separation of Powers20 \n16 \n17    All Plaintiffs allege a violation of the non-delegation doctrine arguing that section \n18 \n102 allows the DHS Secretary to pick and choose among enacted laws and determine, \n19 \nwith unfettered discretion, which ones shall be waived without specifically stating which \n20 \n21  laws will be waived or why.  In essence, Plaintiffs contend, section 102(c) has granted the \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n24  20 California Plaintiffs separate their separation of powers and violation of the non-delegation doctrine \ninto two causes of action despite similar arguments on both claims.  The Court also notes that Coalition \n25 \nPlaintiffs have not sufficiently briefed the issue of separation of powers.  They raise the issue of \n26  “separation of powers” in a heading, but their analysis consists of essentially one sentence.  (Dkt. No. \n29-1 at 34-35.)  Because the non-delegation doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers, \n27  the Court considers the two claims together.  See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371 (1989).   \n65 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2000   Page 66 of 101\n \n1  Executive Branch a blanket waiver which is a violation of the non-delegation doctrine \n2 \nand separation of powers.   \n3 \n  “The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers that \n4 \n5  underlies our tripartite system of Government.”  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, \n6 \n371 (1989).  Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all legislative powers in \n7 \nCongress.  U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  Generally, Congress cannot delegate or transfer the \n8 \n9  legislative functions with which it is vested.  Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. \n10 \n388, 425-26 (1935).  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, “that the separation-\n11 \nof-powers principle, and the nondelegation doctrine in particular, do not prevent \n12 \n13  Congress from obtaining the assistance of its coordinate Branches.”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. \n14 \nat 372.  “In our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more \n15 \ntechnical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power \n16 \n17  under broad general directives.”  Id. (citing Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Adm’r of Wage and \n18 \nHour Div. of Dept. of Labor, 312 U.S. 126, 145 (1941)).   \n19 \nAs a result of this broad constitutional standard, the Supreme Court has upheld all \n20 \n21  Congressional delegations of power since 1935.21  See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 373 (noting \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n24  21 Notably, although the Court has not since struck down a challenged statute, it has narrowly construed \nstatutory delegations. See, e.g., Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. \n25 \n607, 646 (1980) (standard promulgated by Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) limiting \n26  occupational exposure to benzene held to be invalid); Nat’l Cable Television Ass’n. v. United States, \n415 U.S. 336, 342 (1974) (challenge to revision of fee schedule by the Federal Communications \n27  Commission was remanded to Commission to use the proper standard in setting annual fee). \n66 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2001   Page 67 of 101\n \n1  that since 1935, “. . . we have upheld, again without deviation, Congress’ ability to \n2 \ndelegate power under broad standards”); Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 \n3 \n(1996) (affirming that “. . . we have since upheld, without exception, delegations under \n4 \n5  standards phrased in sweeping terms”).  Meanwhile, in 1935, the Supreme Court struck \n6 \ndown two statutes on delegation grounds.  See A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United \n7 \nStates, 295 U.S. 495 (1935) (invalidating the delegation of code-making authority \n8 \n9  contained in the National Industrial Recovery Act as unconstitutional because of the \n10 \nAct’s failure to impose limitations on discretion); Panama Refining Co., 293 U.S. at 388 \n11 \n(invalidating the delegation of power to the President to “prohibit the transportation . . . \n12 \n13  of petroleum” as exceeding constitutional limits because Congress failed to articulate a \n14 \npolicy to limit the President’s discretion).   \n15 \nThe Supreme Court has held that Congress may delegate its authority so long as it \n16 \n17  provides, by legislative act, “an intelligible principle to which the person or body \n18 \nauthorized to [act] is directed to conform.”  Id. (citing J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United \n19 \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928)).   Under the intelligible principle standard, a statute \n20 \n21  delegating authority is constitutional if it “clearly delineates [(1)] the general policy, [(2)] \n22 \nthe public agency which is to apply it, and [(3)] the boundaries of the delegated \n23 \nauthority.”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372-73 (citing American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, \n24 \n25  329 U.S. 90, 105, (1946)). \n26 \n27 \n67 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2002   Page 68 of 101\n \n1    In addition, while courts have recognized limits on Congress’ authority to delegate \n2 \nits legislative power, those limits are less rigid where the entity “itself possesses \n3 \nindependent authority over the subject matter.”  Loving, 517 U.S. at 772 (quoting United \n4 \n5  States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 556-57 (1975)); see also United States v. Curtiss-Wright \n6 \nExport Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319-22 (1936).   \n7 \n  Accordingly, there are two inquiries this Court must consider when determining \n8 \n9  whether section 102(c) is a constitutional delegation of power: (1) whether section 102 \n10 \nmeets the three requirements of the intelligible principle standard; and (2) whether the \n11 \ndegree of discretion granted to the DHS Secretary in section 102(c) is appropriate \n12 \n13  considering the Secretary’s independent authority over the subject matter.  See Mistretta, \n14 \n488 U.S. at 372-72; Loving, 517 U.S. at 772.   \n15 \n    a.  Prong One: Whether Section 102 Clearly Delineates a    \n16 \n17        “General Policy” \n18 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs claim that section 102 fails to identify a general policy because \n19 \nprior courts identified different general policies.  They cite to two recent cases, Sierra \n20 \n21  Club, 2005 WL 8153059, and Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119 \n22 \n(D.D.C. 2007), cert denied, 554 U.S. 918 (2008), where the courts stated different policy \n23 \ngoals in section 102.  Coalition Plaintiffs assert “[w]hen courts cannot identify a common \n24 \n25  statutory policy goal, and the policy some did point to was incorrect, the statutory scheme \n26 \ncannot survive Mistretta scrutiny.”  (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 30.)   \n27 \n68 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2003   Page 69 of 101\n \n1  Defendants argue that Congress defined a “general policy” to guide the DHS \n2 \nSecretary on how to exercise its delegated authority, satisfying the first prong of the \n3 \nintelligible principle standard.  That policy is install necessary barriers and roads to “deter \n4 \n5  illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States” through, under \n6 \nsection 102(c) “expeditious construction of barriers and roads under this section.”  (Dkt. \n7 \nNo. 35-1 at 71.)  Defendants further contend that there is no conflict between the \n8 \n9  statements of general policy by the Sierra Club and the Defenders of Wildlife courts.  \n10 \nRather, one is just more specific than the other.  Id.  Furthermore, later courts found no \n11 \nconflict in the prior courts’ conclusions as to the general policy.  \n12 \n13    Under section 102(a), the general policy states the Secretary of DHS shall take \n14 \nactions as necessary to “deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the \n15 \nUnited States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a).  To carry out this policy, Congress authorizes the \n16 \n17  DHS Secretary to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical \n18 \nbarriers and roads.”  Id.   \n19 \n  The first district court to address whether the amended section 102 contains a \n20 \n21  “general policy” was in this district.  In Sierra Club, the court held that “improvement of \n22 \nU.S. border protection is the ‘clearly delineated general policy.’”  Sierra Club, 2005 WL \n23 \n8153059, at *6.  Two years later, the District of Columbia District Court addressed this \n24 \n25  same question and similarly found that the general policy was clearly delineated as “to \n26 \nexpeditiously ‘install additional physical barriers and roads . . . to deter illegal crossings \n27 \n69 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2004   Page 70 of 101\n \n1  in areas of high illegal entry.’”  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127.  Notably, \n2 \nthe court further held that this identification of the statute’s general policy was not \n3 \ncontrary to that recognized by the Sierra Club court, but rather “in accord with the only \n4 \n5  other decision to address the question of whether [IIRIRA’s] waiver provision is a \n6 \nconstitutional delegation.” Id. (citing Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6).   \n7 \n  While using slightly different language, both courts identified the general policy as \n8 \n9  border protection.  Both courts identified deterrence of illegal crossing as a motivating \n10 \nfactor in this policy.  And both courts recognized that in articulating this policy, Congress \n11 \npermitted the construction of physical barriers and roads.  \n12 \n13    Moreover, the District Court for the Western District of Texas noted the general \n14 \npolicy of section 102 to be “construction of a border fence” which is consistent with the \n15 \ngeneral policy asserted in Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife.  Cnty. of El Paso v. \n16 \n17  Chertoff, No. EP-08-CA-196-FM, 2008 WL 4372693, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2008).  \n18 \nThus, while prior courts have used different language to articulate Congress’s stated \n19 \npolicy goal, they do not provide contradictory interpretations of section 102’s general \n20 \n21  policy.     \n22 \n  Therefore, the Court finds that Congress clearly delineated the “general policy” of \n23 \nsection 102 as deterrence of illegal crossings through construction of additional physical \n24 \n25  barriers to improve U.S. border protection, 8 U.S.C. § 1103, and has satisfied the first \n26 \nprong of the intelligible principle standard.  \n27 \n70 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2005   Page 71 of 101\n \n1      b.  Prong Two: Whether Section 102 Clearly Delineates a Public  \n2 \n      Agency  \n3 \n  It is undisputed that IIRIRA satisfies the second prong of the intelligible principle \n4 \n5  standard because “the Secretary of Homeland Security” is to apply the general policy.  \n6 \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1).  \n7 \n    c.   Prong Three: Whether Section 102 Clearly Delineates “the   \n8 \n9        Boundaries of Delegated Authority”  \n10 \n  All Plaintiffs challenge section 102(c) on the third factor of the intelligible \n11 \nprinciple standard, arguing that the boundaries of the delegated authority are not clearly \n12 \n13  delineated.   They distinguish the Waivers from past waivers found to be constitutional.  \n14 \nPast waivers focused solely on building new fencing pursuant to the specific mandates of \n15 \nCongress in section 102(b) which limited the DHS Secretary’s waiver authority to the \n16 \n17  initial border construction.  However, the Waivers at issue concern projects not \n18 \npreviously identified by section 102.  Therefore, they argue that the grant of waiver \n19 \nauthority does not apply to these new projects.  \n20 \n21    Defendants argue that Congress provided specific boundaries for its delegated \n22 \nauthority, satisfying the third prong of the intelligible principle standard.  This authority \n23 \nmay only be exercised to “waive all legal requirements [the] Secretary . . . determines \n24 \n25  necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.” \n26 \n(Dkt. No. 35-1 at 72.)  The boundaries, they contend, are both geographic, DHS can only \n27 \n71 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2006   Page 72 of 101\n \n1  waive laws in connection with construction of a physical barrier at the U.S. border, and \n2 \ntemporally necessary, DHS can only waive laws necessary to quickly construct a wall.  \n3 \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ demand for specificity, the boundary need not include specific \n4 \n5  criteria or guidelines.22  In short, Congress has the power to be flexible and broad when \n6 \ndelegating authority.  \n7 \n  Here, section 102(c) provides boundaries that limit the Secretary’s authority to \n8 \n9  waive all laws that are “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and \n10 \nroads.”  See Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127 (boundaries clearly defined by \n11 \nCongress’ requirement that Secretary may only waive laws that he determines are \n12 \n13  “necessary to ensure expeditious construction”); Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6 \n14 \n(boundary of authority was limited to actions “necessary to install additional barriers and \n15 \nroads” and specifically, the construction of the Triple Fence in San Diego); Cnty. of El \n16 \n17  Paso, 2008 WL 43726993, at *4 (boundaries clearly defined relying on reasoning in \n18 \nSierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife).     \n19 \n20 \n                                                \n21 \n22  22 California Plaintiffs argue that Defendants fail to address their argument that while the non-delegation \ndoctrine applies to cases where Congress provides the Executive power to decide which laws could be \n23  modified or terminated and under what circumstances, it has not authorized the Secretary to pick and \nchoose among enacted laws and decide, which legislation to waive.  Section 102 does not provide the \n24 \nSecretary with guidance as to which laws are to be waived or why.  Because Defendants failed to \naddress this argument, California Plaintiffs argue section 102(c) is unconstitutional and must be \n25 \ninvalidated.  However, Defendants addressed the boundaries of the Secretary’s authority to waive laws \n26  limited to construction along the U.S. border and only those laws “necessary to ensure expeditious \nconstruction.”  (Dkt. No. 42 at 37.)   \n27   \n72 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2007   Page 73 of 101\n \n1    While it is true that section 102(c) contains considerably fewer details than other \n2 \nchallenged statutes,23 the Supreme Court does not demand that Congress outline specific \n3 \nfactors or criteria when delegating authority.24  Rather, Congress need only delineate the \n4 \n5  boundaries of the delegated authority in broad and general terms.  See Opp Cotton Mills, \n6 \nInc., 312 U.S. at 145.  For example, in upholding Congress’s broad delegation of power \n7 \nto the EPA Administrator, the Whitman Court noted that “even in sweeping regulatory \n8 \n9  schemes we have never demanded . . . that statutes provide a ‘determinate criterion’ for \n10 \nsaying ‘how much [of the regulated harm] is too much.’”  Whitman v. American \n11 \nTrucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001).  This is consistent with prior Supreme Court \n12 \n13  precedent holding that “[o]nly if we could say that there is an absence of standards for the \n14 \nguidance of the Administrator’s action, so that it would be impossible in a proper \n15 \nproceeding to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed, would we be \n16 \n17  justified in overriding [Congress’s] choice of means for effecting its declared purpose. . . \n18 \n.”  Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 (1944).  \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n23 In Mistretta, for example, the statute in question authorized an independent Sentencing Commission to \n24 \nformulate sentencing guidelines for federal offenses.  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 367.  Congress identified \nthree goals, four purposes, numerous guidelines, eleven factors for sentencing consideration, a \n25 \nprohibition on certain factors for sentencing consideration.  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 374-78.  \n26 \n24 In fact, the Court in Mistretta even recognized that the Act in question set forth “more than merely an \n‘intelligible principle.’”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (emphasis added). \n27 \n73 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2008   Page 74 of 101\n \n1    Section 102 of IIRIRA is easily distinguishable from the statutes in Panama \n2 \nRefining Co. and A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp.  The statute at issue in Panama \n3 \nRefining Co. “provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion,” while the \n4 \n5  statute challenged in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp “conferred authority to regulate the \n6 \nentire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy \n7 \nby assuring ‘fair competition.’”  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 474.   \n8 \n9    Here, however, Congress expressly limits the DHS Secretary’s discretion to waive \n10 \nlaws to those “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n11 \nunder this section.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1).  Congress’s use of the word “necessary” to \n12 \n13  define the scope of discretion is well with the limits of non-delegation precedents.  In \n14 \nTouby, for example, the Supreme Court upheld a provision of the Controlled Substances \n15 \nAct that permitted the Attorney General to schedule a drug when doing so is “necessary \n16 \n17  to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.”  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, \n18 \n165 (1991).  Similarly, in Indus. Union Dep’t, the Supreme Court upheld a provision of \n19 \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act that empowered the Secretary of Labor to \n20 \n21  promulgate standards that are “reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or \n22 \nhealthful employment and places of employment.”  Indus. Union Dep’t., AFL-CIO v. \n23 \nAmerican Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980).  Finally, in Whitman, the Supreme \n24 \n25  Court upheld a provision of the Clean Air Act that directed the EPA Administrator to set \n26 \nstandards that are “requisite to protect the public health” with “an adequate margin of \n27 \n74 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2009   Page 75 of 101\n \n1  safety.”  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475.  “Requisite,” in this context, “mean[s] sufficient, but \n2 \nnot more than necessary.”  Id. at 473.  Furthermore, this limit on authority is the same \n3 \nlimit that was approved by the court in Sierra Club.   \n4 \n5    Both Congress and the Executive share responsibilities in protecting the country \n6 \nfrom terrorists and contraband illegally entering at the borders.  Border barriers, roads, \n7 \nand detection equipment help provide a measure of deterrence against illegal entries. \n8 \n9  With section 102, Congress delegated to its executive counterpart, the responsibility to \n10 \nconstruct border barriers as needed in areas of high illegal entry to detect and deter illegal \n11 \nentries.  In an increasingly complex and changing world, this delegation avoids the need \n12 \n13  for Congress to pass a new law to authorize the construction of every border project.  \n14 \nSimilarly, Congress enacted a law which attempts to avoid delays caused by lawsuits \n15 \nchallenging the construction of barriers by allowing the Secretary to waive the \n16 \n17  application and enforcement of federal, state and local laws during the construction of a \n18 \nborder barrier as necessary.  The Court concludes that Congress has clearly delineated the \n19 \n“boundaries of delegated authority” in terms previously upheld by the Supreme Court, \n20 \n21  thereby satisfying the third prong of the intelligible principle standard.  \n22 \n  d.  Whether Congress’s Grant of Authority Constitutes “Unfettered    \n23 \n    Discretion” \n24 \n25    Coalition Plaintiffs cite to Zivotofsky to suggest that the DHS secretary does not \n26 \nhave exclusive control over foreign affairs, and thus the statutory grant of discretion \n27 \n75 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2010   Page 76 of 101\n \n1  should be more limited.  Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2089-90 (2015).  \n2 \nDefendants argue that the Executive Branch has significant, independent control over \n3 \nimmigration, foreign affairs, and national security, and therefore broad waiver authority \n4 \n5  is justified.  (Dkt. No. 35 at 74.)  They attack Coalition Plaintiffs’ reliance on Zivotofsky \n6 \nand cite to binding precedent in support of their position.  See Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n7 \n338 U.S. 537, 542-43 (1950) (“The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of \n8 \n9  sovereignty . . . [and] is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of \n10 \nthe nation.”). \n11 \n  Congress can confer more discretion to an entity when that entity already has \n12 \n13  significant, independent authority over the subject matter.  See Loving, 517 U.S. at 772-\n14 \n73.  Here, Congress delegated broad authority to the DHS Secretary, an agent of the \n15 \nExecutive Branch.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(c).    \n16 \n17    As stated in Sierra Club, the Executive Branch has independent and significant \n18 \nconstitutional authority in the area of “immigration and border control enforcement and \n19 \nnational security.”  Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6 (citing Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542-\n20 \n21  43).  Additionally, the court in Save Our Heritage confirmed that the construction of San \n22 \nDiego barriers relate to “foreign affairs and immigration control—areas over which the \n23 \nExecutive Branch traditionally exercises independent authority.”  Save Our Heritage, 533 \n24 \n25  F. Supp. 2d at 63 (citing Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 129). \n26 \n27 \n76 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2011   Page 77 of 101\n \n1    Nothing about DHS’s authority has changed since prior rulings.  The only \n2 \ndifference between this case and prior cases is the type of barrier being constructed.  This \n3 \ndistinction is not relevant under this analysis.  \n4 \n5    Coalition Plaintiffs’ reliance on Zivotofsky is not persuasive.  The power \n6 \ncontemplated in Zivotofsky was the President’s power to recognize foreign nations and \n7 \ngovernments and the issue was whether the President has exclusive power to recognize \n8 \n9  nations.  Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2084. \n10 \n  Here, the issue is not whether the President has exclusive power over foreign \n11 \naffairs, but whether the DHS Secretary, acting as an agent of the Executive, has \n12 \n13  significant, independent control over immigration.  Therefore, because the DHS \n14 \nSecretary, acting as an agent of the Executive Branch, has significant, independent \n15 \nauthority over immigration, Congress is justified in delegating broad authority.  The \n16 \n17  Court concludes that section 102 does not violate the non-delegation doctrine.   \n18 \n  California Plaintiffs also present a separate argument that the lack of judicial \n19 \nreview under section 102 violates the non-delegation doctrine and essentially imports a \n20 \n21  fourth requirement to the intelligible principle standard.  (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 45.)  By \n22 \nlimiting review to only constitutional challenges, California Plaintiffs argue, Congress is \n23 \npreventing the judicial branch from reviewing Congress’s delegation of authority.  \n24 \n25  California Plaintiffs further contend that judicial review is the only way to ensure that the \n26 \nDHS Secretary adheres to the intelligible principle Congress provided.  California cites to \n27 \n77 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2012   Page 78 of 101\n \n1  three Supreme Court cases in support of this argument.25  In none of these cases, \n2 \nhowever, did the Court strike down the statute for lack of judicial review.26   \n3 \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ argument has been expressly rejected by the \n4 \n5  Ninth Circuit.  United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1041-45 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n6 \nIn Bozarov, the Ninth Circuit held that the nondelegation doctrine was not violated \n7 \nbecause the EAA precluded judicial review.  “In sum, we believe that the Supreme Court \n8 \n9  cases upholding judicial preclusion of agency decisions, the language of the APA, and \n10 \nthe fact that the EAA involves foreign policy issues support our conclusion that the \n11 \nEAA’s preclusion of judicial review is constitutional.”  Id. at 1044.  Furthermore, the \n12 \n13  Ninth Circuit also noted that its conclusion that the prelusion of judicial review did not \n14 \nviolate the nondelegation clause was “bolstered” by the availability of judicial review for \n15 \nconstitutional claims and ultra vires claims.  Id. at 1044-45.  Similarly, in Cnty. of El \n16 \n17  Paso, the same argument concerning whether judicial review was a requirement of the \n18 \nintelligible principle standard was rejected by the court.  Cnty. of El Paso, 2008 WL \n19 \n4372693 at *4-6.   \n20 \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n25 A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 295 U.S. at 533; American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, \n23  106 (1946); and Touby, 500 U.S. at 165. \n24  26 In A.L.A. Schechter Poultry, the Court struck down the statute not on the grounds that it lacked \njudicial review, but because of the Act’s failure to impose limitations on discretion.  295 U.S. at 533.  In \n25  American Power, the plaintiffs challenged the statute not on the grounds that it lacked judicial review, \nbut rather because it lacked “ascertainable standards,” thereby granting the SEC unfettered discretion.  \n26 \n329 U.S. at 104.  In Touby, the dispositive issue was not judicial review, rather whether the delegation \nafforded too much discretion.  500 U.S. at 165. \n27 \n78 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2013   Page 79 of 101\n \n1  It is true that the Supreme Court has recognized that judicial review provides an \n2 \nimportant check on the power delegated by Congress.  See Touby, 500 U.S. at 167-69; \n3 \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 295 U.S. at 533; Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426 (recognizing \n4 \n5  the importance of judicial review by observing that one of the purposes of requiring \n6 \nCongress to provide intelligible principles was so that a tribunal “in a proper proceeding \n7 \n[may] ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed.”).  These cases recognize \n8 \n9  that judicial review allows for the enforcement of the intelligible principle requirement \n10 \nand the separation of powers.  At the same time, a Supreme Court nondelegation doctrine \n11 \ncase has never turned on the presence or absence of judicial review.   \n12 \n13  While unlimited judicial review would assure compliance with all legal \n14 \nrequirements, it would defeat the purpose of the law to expedite the construction of \n15 \nborder barriers and roads in areas where they are needed.  In this case, as in Bozarov, \n16 \n17  section 102 allows judicial review of constitutional claims as well as ultra vires claim \n18 \nwhich bolsters the conclusion that section 102 does not violate the nondelegation \n19 \ndoctrine.  Accordingly, the California Plaintiffs’ argument concerning violation of the \n20 \n21  non-delegation doctrine based on lack of judicial review is unsupported by law.   \n22 \n  In conclusion, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions for summary judgment \n23 \nand DENIES Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on the Non-Delegation Doctrine \n24 \n25  and separation of powers claims. \n26 \n///    \n27 \n79 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2014   Page 80 of 101\n \n1    2.  Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution - Take Care Clause \n2 \n  Center Plaintiff alleges that the August 2 Waiver Determination violates the Take \n3 \nCare Clause contending that it applies to Executive Officers, including the Secretary of \n4 \n5  DHS.  First, it claims that the DHS exceeded the authority delegated to it by issuing the \n6 \nAugust 2 Waiver under section 102 even though it was not authorized by section 102(b).  \n7 \n(Dkt. No. 28-1 at 42-43.)  Second, it asserts that even if section 102(c) waiver provision \n8 \n9  is not limited to those barriers mandated under section 102(b), the August 2 Waiver \n10 \nDetermination does not comply with the direction in section 102(a) that the barriers be \n11 \nbuilt in “areas of high illegal entry.”  (Id. at 43.)  Therefore, Center Plaintiff argues, the \n12 \n13  August 2 Waiver Determination violated the Executive’s duty to faithfully execute the \n14 \nstatutory mandate.  (Id.)  The Center Plaintiff’s SAC alleges that “[a]mong the laws the \n15 \nTake Care Clause mandates be ‘faithfully executed’ are NEPA and the ESA, as well as \n16 \n17  the conditions and limitations of IIRIRA section 102 itself.”  (Dkt. No. 16, SAC ¶ 145.)   \n18 \n  Defendants argue that the Take Care Clause only applies to the actions of the \n19 \nPresident and not the Secretary, that no court has treated the Take Care Clause as a basis \n20 \n21  for affirmative relief, and that it is an improper attempt by Center Plaintiff to recast its \n22 \nultra vires challenge under the Take Care Clause.    \n23 \n  Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution states that the President \n24 \n25  “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 3.   \n26 \n27 \n80 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2015   Page 81 of 101\n \n1    First, the Court disagrees with Defendants’ argument that the Take Care Clause \n2 \napplies only to the President, and not his cabinet members.  “The vesting of the executive \n3 \npower in the President was essentially a grant of power to execute the laws.  But the \n4 \n5  President alone and unaided could not execute the laws.  He must execute them by the \n6 \nassistance of subordinates.”  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 117 (1926); see also \n7 \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997) (“The Constitution does not leave to \n8 \n9  speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, \n10 \n“shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” Art. II, § 3, personally and through \n11 \nofficers whom he appoints . . . .”)  Moreover, when the Supreme Court granted certiorari \n12 \n13  in United States v. Texas, it, sua sponte, asked for additional briefing on “Whether the \n14 \nGuidance27 violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, 3.”  United States v. \n15 \nTexas, 136 S. Ct. 906 (2016).  The issue was whether the Secretary of DHS’ actions \n16 \n17  establishing Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n18 \n(“DAPA”) violated the Take Care Clause, an issue not addressed by the district court.28  \n19 \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 607 (2015).  Therefore, the Supreme Court’s \n20 \n21                                                  \n22 \n27 The government described Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent \n23  Residents (“DAPA”) as “Deferred Action Guidance.”  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 667 \n(2015).   \n24  28 The district court in Texas noted that the issue was whether the Secretary of DHS has the power to \nestablish DAPA stating that the President had not issued any executive orders or presidential \n25 \nproclamation or communique concerning DAPA but that it was solely established by the Secretary.  \n26  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 607.  In contrast, in this case, President Trump issued an Executive Order on \nJanuary 25, 2017 directing the Secretary of DHS to take steps to “obtain complete operations control . . .  \n27  of the southern border.”  (Dkt. No. 30-5, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 7, Executive Order, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793.)   \n81 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2016   Page 82 of 101\n \n1  decision to sua sponte address the Take Care clause in relation to an act of the Secretary \n2 \nof DHS indicates that the Take Care clause applies not only to the President but also his \n3 \nExecutive officers.   \n4 \n5    As to whether the August 2 Waiver Determination violates the Take Care clause, \n6 \nCenter Plaintiff cites to three cases to support the assertion that the Executive is required \n7 \nto “execute the laws, not make them.”  First, it cites to a sentence in the conclusion of \n8 \n9  Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 532 (2008) stating that the Take Care clause that laws \n10 \nbe faithfully executed requires the Executive to “execute the law, not make them.”  Id. at \n11 \n532.  But Medellin dealt with the legal effect of an international treaty on domestic law.  \n12 \n13  Id. at 504.  In fact, the Court mentioned that the Take Care clause did not apply in the \n14 \ncase since the International Court of Justice’s decision was an international judgment.  Id. \n15 \nat 532.  Medellin did not concern a statute enacted by Congress and is not helpful in the \n16 \n17  Take Care analysis.   \n18 \n  Next, Center Plaintiff cites to Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. \n19 \n579, 587 (1952) in support of its argument that the President’s power is to faithfully \n20 \n21  execute the laws, not make them.  Due to an impending nation-wide strike of the steel \n22 \nmills, the President, on his own, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of \n23 \nCommerce to take possession of most of the country’s steel mills and keep them running.  \n24 \n25  Id. at 583.  The steel mill owners filed suit alleging that the seizures were not authorized \n26 \nby Congress or any other constitutional provision.  Id.  The Court agreed explaining that \n27 \n82 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2017   Page 83 of 101\n \n1  the President’s power must come from either an act of Congress or from the Constitution.  \n2 \nId. at 585.  However, in the case, the Executive Order “did not direct that a congressional \n3 \npolicy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress—it directs that a presidential \n4 \n5  policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President.”  Id. at 588.  Such conduct to \n6 \nmake laws is only delegated to Congress, and not the President.  Id.  The Supreme Court \n7 \naffirmed the district court’s preliminary injunction restraining the Secretary from \n8 \n9  enforcing the Executive Order.  Id. at 584.  In contrast, in this case, Congress enacted \n10 \nsection 102(c), which grants the Secretary of DHS not only the discretion to waive all \n11 \nlaws when “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads” but \n12 \n13  also discretion to determine whether it is necessary to install barriers to deter “illegal \n14 \ncrossings in areas of high illegal entry.”  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a) & (c).  Therefore, \n15 \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. does not support Center Plaintiff’s position.   \n16 \n17    Finally, in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), the question presented to \n18 \nthe Supreme Court was “whether under the Constitution the President has the exclusive \n19 \npower of removing executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by and \n20 \n21  with the advice and consent of the Senate.”  Id. at 60.  The case dealt with the power of \n22 \nthe President to appoint and remove executive officers as opposed to the discretion of the \n23 \nSecretary of the DHS to carry out section 102, a provision enacted by Congress.   \n24 \n25  The cases cited by Center Plaintiff do not address the application of the Take Care \n26 \nclause.  It merely cite to these cases for the assertion that the President’s duty under the \n27 \n83 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2018   Page 84 of 101\n \n1  Take Care clause is to execute laws, not make them.  However, none of the cases cited by \n2 \nCenter Plaintiff address an executive head’s exercise of his or her discretionary authority \n3 \nto carry out the mandates of Congress.  As a result, they provide no guidance as to how \n4 \n5  the Take Care clause would or should apply in this case.  Moreover, given that the \n6 \nchallenged steps taken by the Secretary are ones that are plausibly called for by an act of \n7 \nCongress, a Take Care challenge in this case would essentially open the doors to an \n8 \n9  undisciplined and unguided review process for all decisions made by the Executive \n10 \nDepartment.   \n11 \nConsequently, Center Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Take Care clause in \n12 \n13  this case has been violated.  Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary \n14 \njudgment and DENIES Center Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the Take \n15 \nCare Clause claim.   \n16 \n17    3.  Article I, Sections 2 & 3 of the United States Constitution \n18 \n  California Plaintiffs argue that section 102(c) violates Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of \n19 \nthe U.S. Constitution by allowing the Secretary to waive numerous criminal laws \n20 \n21  concerning the border wall projects without providing a specific list of criminal laws that \n22 \nare waived.29  Defendants contend that California Plaintiffs have provided no legal \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25 \n29 For example, California Plaintiffs argue the Secretary waived the Resource Conservation Recovery \n26  Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6928, which makes it a crime to knowingly dump hazardous waste that puts another \nperson in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, and waived the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § \n27  1319(c) making it a crime to knowingly pollute a river, stream or other water.  \n84 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2019   Page 85 of 101\n \n1  authority to support their argument that Article I, Sections 2 and 3 address Congress’ \n2 \ndelegation of power to waive criminal law to the Executive.   \n3 \n  Article 1 Section 3 provides, \n4 \n5  Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal \nfrom Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office . . . but the \n6 \nParty convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, \n7  Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.   \n \n8 \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 3, cl. 7.  This section concerns impeachment and punishment of \n9 \nconviction and is “an attempt by the framers to anticipate and respond to questions that \n10 \n11  might arise regarding the procedural right of the accused during the impeachment \n12 \nprocess.”  United States v. Claiborne, 727 F.2d 842, 846 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting United \n13 \nStates v. Hastings, 681 F.2d 706, 710 (11th Cir. 1982)).  California Plaintiffs also cite to \n14 \n15  Article I, Section 2 which states that the President “shall have Power to grant Reprieves \n16 \nand Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”  \n17 \nU.S. Const. art I, § 2, cl. 1.   \n18 \n19    California Plaintiffs invoke these two constitutional provisions arguing that \n20 \nCongress cannot grant the Executive Branch sweeping powers to waive federal criminal \n21 \nlaws without specifically listing the criminal laws to be waived and that it places the \n22 \n23  Executive Branch above the law.  However, California Plaintiffs provide no legal \n24 \nauthority to support their argument that Article I, Sections 2 & 3 supports their \n25 \nproposition.  None of their cited cases concern the application of Article I, Sections 2 or 3 \n26 \n27 \n85 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2020   Page 86 of 101\n \n1  of the U.S. Constitution.  California Plaintiffs have not demonstrated they are entitled to \n2 \njudgment as a matter of law that section 102 and the Waiver Determinations violate \n3 \nArticle I, Sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution.  The Court GRANTS Defendant’s \n4 \n5  motion for summary judgment and DENIES California Plaintiffs’ motion for summary \n6 \njudgment on this claim.  \n7 \n  4.  Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution - Presentment Clause \n8 \n9    All Plaintiffs assert that the DHS Secretaries’ waiver of more than thirty \n10 \nenvironmental laws through section 102(c) violates Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. \n11 \nConstitution.  They rely heavily on Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998) \n12 \n13  arguing that allowing DHS to waive laws through section 102(c) amounts to an \n14 \namendment or repeal of statutes.  Section 102 gives the DHS Secretary “nearly unbridled \n15 \ndiscretion” to waive laws and would waive laws in which DHS has no expertise.  (Dkt. \n16 \n17  No. 30-2 at 49.)  Since Congress provides no guidance as to which laws to waive, the \n18 \nSecretary’s actions will solely reflect the Executive’s will.  (Id. at 50.)   \n19 \n  Defendants argue that the waiver of the environmental laws through section 102(c) \n20 \n21  does not amount to an amendment or repeal of statute and only select statutes are waived \n22 \nin an effort to build roads and barriers next to portions of the border.  Defendants liken \n23 \nthe waiver to an “executive grant of immunity or waiver of claim” which “has never been \n24 \n25  recognized as a form of legislative repeal.”  Id. (quoting In re Nat’l Sec. Agency \n26 \nTelecomm. Records Litig., 671 F.3d 881 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Defendants argue that here, \n27 \n86 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2021   Page 87 of 101\n \n1  like in Telecomm., there is no constitutional violation of the Presentment Clause because \n2 \nthe partially waived statutes remain the same from when Congress approved the statute \n3 \nand the President signed it.  Defendants contend that here, unlike Clinton, there is no \n4 \n5  separation of powers issue because Congress gave DHS authority to partially waive \n6 \nstatutes for a border wall when Congress amended section 102.   Defendants distinguish \n7 \nthe situation here from Clinton by noting that DHS Secretary is implementing \n8 \n9  congressional intent rather than rejecting it.   \n10 \n  According to the Presentment Clause, “[e]very Bill which shall have passed the \n11 \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to \n12 \n13  the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return \n14 \nit, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the \n15 \nObjections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.”  U.S. Const. art I., § 7.  \n16 \n17  The Constitution does not allow the Executive “to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  \n18 \nClinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  “‘Amendment and repeal of \n19 \nstatutes, no less than enactment, must conform with’ the bicameralism and presentment \n20 \n21  requirements of Article I.”  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 123-24 (quoting \n22 \nINS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 954 (1983)).  \n23 \n  In Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the Line Item Veto Act because \n24 \n25  “[i]n both legal and practical effect,” the Line Item Veto gave the President the power to \n26 \namend “Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each.”  Clinton, 524 U.S. at 438.  In \n27 \n87 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2022   Page 88 of 101\n \n1  Clinton, cancellation of legal provisions altered the statute’s “legal force or effect.”  Id. at \n2 \n437.  In essence, the Line Item Veto Act replaced the once legally-passed bills with \n3 \ntruncated replacements.  Id. at 438.  The Supreme Court considered this alteration a \n4 \n5  disruption of the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Presentment Clause.  \n6 \nId.  \n7 \n  This situation, however, is distinguishable from Clinton.  Here, the Waivers are \n8 \n9  narrow in scope and only for the purpose of building border barriers something that is \n10 \npermitted by section 102(c).  In Clinton, the Line Item Veto Act rendered the cancelled \n11 \nlegal provisions powerless and effectively changed the law entirely.  Id. at 437.  Here, the \n12 \n13  statutes largely retain legal force and effect because the §102(c) waivers only disturb the \n14 \nwaived statutes for a specific purpose and for a specific time.    \n15 \n  In Defenders of Wildlife, the district court addressed the plaintiffs’ presentment \n16 \n17  clause challenge to section 102(c) and stated,  \n18 \nThe REAL ID Act’s waiver provision differs significantly from the Line \n19  Item Veto Act.  The Secretary has no authority to alter the text of any \nstatute, repeal any law, or cancel any statutory provision, in whole or in part.  \n20 \nEach of the twenty laws waived by the Secretary on October 26, 2007, \n21  retains the same legal force and effect as it had when it was passed by both \nhouses of Congress and presented to the President.   \n22 \n \n23  527 F. Supp. 2d at 124; see also Cnty. of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *6-7.  The court \n24 \nalso explained that the waiver did not constitute an unconstitutional “partial repeal” \n25 \nbecause this was not an instance in which “any waiver, no matter how limited in scope, \n26 \n27 \n88 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2023   Page 89 of 101\n \n1  would violate Article I because it would allow the Executive Branch to unilaterally \n2 \n‘repeal’ or nullify the law with respect to the limited purpose delineated by the waiver \n3 \nlegislation.”  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. at 124.  The Court concludes that the \n4 \n5  Secretaries’ Waiver Determinations made pursuant section 102(c) do not violate the \n6 \nPresentment Clause.  The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions for summary judgment \n7 \nand DENIES Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on this issue. \n8 \n9    5.  Access to the Courts \n10 \n    a.  Due Process/First Amendment Right to Petition/Article III30 \n11 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs argue in their motion, but not in their reply, in one paragraph, \n12 \n13  that section 102(c)(2) deprives them of their due process rights and impairs their First \n14 \nAmendment right to petition the government.  (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 36-37.)  They argue they \n15 \nhave a property and liberty interest in ensuring environmental laws and interests are \n16 \n17  protected and section 102(c)(2) removes any procedure that would protect their interests \n18 \nfrom arbitrary and capricious conduct by the Secretary.   \n19 \n20 \n21                                                  \n22 \n30 In reply, California Plaintiffs appear to assert a void-for-vagueness challenge under the First \n23  Amendment in response to an argument made in Defendants’ brief.  (Dkt. No. at 25; Dkt. No. 35-1 at 84 \nn.53.)  The void-for vagueness argument, raised initially in California Plaintiffs’ reply, morphed into a \n24 \nclaim based on the parties’ argument.  California Plaintiffs did not raise the issue of void for vagueness \nunder the First Amendment in their moving papers, and in fact, is not a claim alleged in their complaint.  \n25 \nInstead, their complaint and their moving brief claim that section 102(c) is vague and therefore a \n26  violation of their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment which is distinct from a void-for-\nvagueness claim.  The Court declines to address the void-for-vagueness challenge, an issue not raised in \n27  California Plaintiffs’ complaint or moving brief.  \n89 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2024   Page 90 of 101\n \n1    California Plaintiffs argue that section 102(c)’s unreasonable procedural hurdles \n2 \nviolate Californians’ Article III and due process rights and the rights to potential parties’ \n3 \nability to petition the Court.  They argue that the 2017 Waivers fail to identify the state \n4 \n5  laws that are purportedly waived.  They also argue that the San Diego Waiver is vague \n6 \nwhen it states that DHS intends to install “various border infrastructure projects” within \n7 \nthe “Project Areas” but fails to describe these other projects.  Next, they argue that the \n8 \n9  San Diego Waiver does not provide reasonable notice as to when undisclosed projects \n10 \nwill be constructed and purports to waive federal and state laws for the on-going \n11 \nmaintenance of these structures.  These uncertainties leave California unable to determine \n12 \n13  whether the projects will be the types of projects authorized by section 102, whether the \n14 \nareas will be considered areas of high illegal entry at the time they are installed and \n15 \nwhether California should file a claim to protect their individual rights.  Also, by barring \n16 \n17  all non-constitutional claims, the California Plaintiffs contend section 102(c)(2)(A) \n18 \ninterferes with its right of access to the courts.31  California claims it has an interest in \n19 \nenforcing its own state laws and to preserve state property adjacent to the Projects.   \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n31 California Plaintiffs also summarily argue that the 60 day statute of limitations from the date of \n24 \npublication in the Federal Register creates the risk that Californians will not learn about the full extent of \nthe 2017 Waivers as it lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate notice which violates Article III of the \n25 \nU.S. Constitution.  Defendants respond that this challenge is an irrelevant hypothetical as their \n26  complaint was timely filed.  California Plaintiffs do not reply to Defendants’ argument.  The Court \nagrees that California Plaintiffs are asserting an argument that has no application to them as they filed \n27  their complaint timely; moreover, they provide no case law to support their argument.   \n90 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2025   Page 91 of 101\n \n1    Defendants claim that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have a cognizable \n2 \nlife, liberty or property interest for a due process violation.  They contend that California \n3 \nPlaintiffs’ assertion of Article III standing is distinct from a liberty or property interest \n4 \n5  protected by the Fifth Amendment.  \n6 \n  The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause states “[n]o person shall . . . be \n7 \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  \n8 \n9  As a threshold, a plaintiff must show a liberty or property interest protected by the \n10 \nConstitution.  Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1155 (9th Cir. 2013).  \n11 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs summarily state they have property and liberty interests in \n12 \n13  ensuring environmental laws and interest are protected.32  California also claims it has an \n14 \ninterest in enforcing its own state laws and to preserve state property adjacent to the \n15 \nProjects.  However, Coalition Plaintiffs and California have not provided any case law \n16 \n17  supporting the claim that their property and/or liberty interests are protected by the \n18 \nConstitution and have failed to provide any meaningful analysis on the due process \n19 \nviolation claim.  Moreover, the Court notes that many of California Plaintiffs’ arguments \n20 \n21  are speculative and concern issues that may arise in the future with future border wall \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n32 In their reply, Coalition Plaintiffs dispute Defendants’ argument that they failed to identify a liberty or \n25 \nproperty interest to support a due process claim and argued they asserted their right to access the courts \n26  and to enforce environmental and animal-protection laws.  (Dkt. No. 38 at 26 n.10.)   However, in their \nmoving papers, Coalition Plaintiffs do not assert an interest in their right to access the courts in their due \n27  process analysis but solely an interest in “environmental laws and interests.”  (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 36-37.) \n91 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2026   Page 92 of 101\n \n1  construction projects and do not address the current projects.  The Court declines to \n2 \naddress any issues concerning future projects as California Plaintiffs have not provided \n3 \nlegal support for their arguments.   \n4 \n5  California Plaintiffs also claim that the 2017 Waivers do not identify which \n6 \nspecific state laws are purportedly waived as the waiver language waives a specific list of \n7 \nover 30 federal statutes, “including all federal, state, or other laws, regulations and legal \n8 \n9  requirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of, the following statutes.”  (Dkt. \n10 \nNo. 30-6, Cayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. 35985; id., Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. 42830.)  \n11 \nCalifornia Plaintiffs broadly interpret the provision to include numerous state laws which \n12 \n13  Defendants argue are inapplicable to the Projects at issue.  Once again, California \n14 \nPlaintiffs fail to provide any legal authority on whether a statute that permits the waiver \n15 \nof laws requires specificity as to which laws are implicated.  The one case cited, FCC v. \n16 \n17  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012), deals with a statute that either \n18 \nrequires or forbids conduct, but does not involve the waiver of laws.  \n19 \n  Lastly, Coalition Plaintiffs, in one paragraph, and not addressed in their reply, \n20 \n21  (Dkt. No. 29-1 at 36), and California Plaintiffs, raised in a paragraph, and not in their \n22 \nreply, (Dkt. No. 30-2 at 41), further claim that their First Amendment Right to Petition \n23 \nthe government has been abridged by the judicial review bar in section 102(c)(2).   \n24 \n25    The First Amendment guarantees “the right of the people . . . to petition the \n26 \nGovernment for a redress of grievances.”  U.S. Const. amend.

The Court declines to \n3 \naddress an issue not properly briefed by the parties.   \n4 \n5    Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions for summary judgment and \n6 \nDENIES Coalition and California Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on these \n7 \nissues.  \n8 \n9    6.  Violation of the Tenth Amendment33 - Concurrent State and    \n10 \n    Federal Jurisdiction \n11 \n  Coalition Plaintiffs argue that Congress lacks the power to eliminate the concurrent \n12 \n13  jurisdiction of state courts unless it vests that power exclusively with a federal court.  \n14 \n(Dkt. No. 29-1 at 35-36.)  They contend that section 102 eliminates both federal and state \n15 \njurisdiction by “vesting ‘exclusive jurisdiction’ over issues into a federal court only then \n16 \n17  to also remove that judicial power from the very federal court it just vested with that \n18 \npower.”  (Id. at 36.)  Defendants respond that Congress has specifically displaced state \n19 \ncourt jurisdiction when it enacted section 102(c)(2)(A), and expressly made federal \n20 \n21  jurisdiction exclusive for challenges to the waiver determinations.   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26  33 In their papers, Coalition Plaintiffs do not allege whether the concurrent federal and state jurisdiction \nargument is premised on a Tenth Amendment violation.  However, their complaint alleges a Tenth \n27  Amendment violation based on this argument.  (Dkt. No. 26, FAC ¶ 115.) \n93 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2028   Page 94 of 101\n \n1    “Under our federal system, the States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of \n2 \nthe Federal Government, subject only to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause. \n3 \nUnder this system of dual sovereignty, we have consistently held that state courts have \n4 \n5  inherent authority, and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising \n6 \nunder the laws of the United States.”  Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990).  “This \n7 \ndeeply rooted presumption in favor of concurrent state court jurisdiction is, of course, \n8 \n9  rebutted if Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular \n10 \nfederal claim.”  Id. at 459.   \n11 \n  Section 102(c)(2)(A) grants the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction to handle \n12 \n13  all causes of action arising under section 102(c)(1) alleging a violation of the Constitution \n14 \nbut shall not have jurisdiction over any other claim.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(2)(A).  By \n15 \nenacting section 102(c), Congress’s authority to grant exclusive jurisdiction to review any \n16 \n17  waiver determination to the federal district court is undisputed by the parties.  Congress \n18 \nspecifically granted federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of any constitutional \n19 \nchallenges but barred judicial review of any non-constitutional claim.  Coalition Plaintiffs \n20 \n21  have not provided any legal authority that granting federal court exclusive jurisdiction \n22 \nover waiver determinations for solely constitutional clams violates the federal system of \n23 \nconcurrent federal and state jurisdiction.   \n24 \n25    Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and \n26 \nDENIES Coalition Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on this issue.  \n27 \n94 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2029   Page 95 of 101\n \n1    7.  Violation of California’s Equal Sovereignty and Police Powers under  \n2 \n    the Tenth Amendment  \n3 \n  The Tenth Amendment states that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States \n4 \n5  by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States \n6 \nrespectively, or to the people.”  U.S. Const. amend X.  The State of California argues that \n7 \nunder the authority of Shelby Cnty., Alabama v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), section \n8 \n9  102 violates the Tenth Amendment.  California asserts that the Waivers violate the Tenth \n10 \nAmendment by burdening California, but not other states, when progress has been made \n11 \ncurbing the problem that section 102 seeks to address, i.e. the dramatic reduction in the \n12 \n13  number of illegal crossings at the border.  California also contends that under City of \n14 \nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 534-35 (1997), section 102 interferes with California’s \n15 \npolice powers by intruding on its state sovereignty by waiving all state and local laws and \n16 \n17  regulations without any parameters and intruding on every level of government under a \n18 \ngrossly broad law.  Defendants argue that Shelby and City of Boerne are distinguishable \n19 \nand do not support California’s argument.   \n20 \n21    Shelby involved a challenge to the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”), enacted in 1965.  \n22 \nShelby, 133 S. Ct. at 2619.  The Court held that the coverage formula contained in § 4(b) \n23 \nof the VRA, identifying jurisdictions covered by § 5’s preclearance requirement, was \n24 \n25  unconstitutional.  Id. at 2620.  If a state was a covered jurisdiction, § 5 required that no \n26 \nchanges could be made to a state’s voting procedures unless approved by federal \n27 \n95 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2030   Page 96 of 101\n \n1  authorities.  Id.  These provisions were originally meant to be temporary as they were to \n2 \nexpire in five years but Congress subsequently reauthorized the Act several times.  Id.  \n3 \nWhile the Court recognized the Supremacy Clause, it also noted the States’ broad \n4 \n5  autonomy “in structuring their governments and pursuing legislative objectives” and that \n6 \nthe framers of the Constitution “intended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in \n7 \nthe Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.”  Id. at 2623 (citations omitted) \n8 \n9  (noting that while the Federal Government has significant control over federal elections, \n10 \nstates have “broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage \n11 \nmay be exercised.”).  The Court also noted the “fundamental principle of equal \n12 \n13  ‘sovereignty’ among the States.”  Id. (emphasis in original).   \n14 \n  The VRA restriction only applied to nine States and some additional counties \n15 \nthereby violating the principal of equal sovereignty.  Id. at 2624.  In order to justify \n16 \n17  violating the equal sovereignty of states, the Court required that the statute’s requirement \n18 \nbe “sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.”  Id. at 2622.  The Court found that \n19 \nthe conditions that originally justified the VRA’s passage, entrenched racial \n20 \n21  discrimination in voting, no longer existed in the covered states and counties as African-\n22 \nAmerican voter turnout exceeded white voter turnout in the majority of the states covered \n23 \nby § 5.  Id. at 2618-19.  When a law treats one state differently from another, the \n24 \n25  Supreme Court “requires a showing that a statute’s disparate geographic coverage is \n26 \nsufficiently related to the problem that it targets.”  Id. at 2622 (quoting Nw. Austin \n27 \n96 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2031   Page 97 of 101\n \n1  Municipal Util. Dist. Number One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203-04 (2009)).  The court \n2 \nheld that the coverage formula under § 4 was unconstitutional.  Id. at 2631. \n3 \n  Relying on the principles in Shelby, California argues that section 102 violates the \n4 \n5  Tenth Amendment because it disparately treats California in imposing waiver of its laws \n6 \nto build additional barriers even though the number of “high illegal entry” of aliens has \n7 \ndramatically decreased in recent years.   \n8 \n9    Here, unlike the State’s power to regulate elections in Shelby, the authority vested \n10 \nin the Secretary of DHS concerning immigration and border security is broad.  See \n11 \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 395; Kleindienst, 408 U.S. at 765.  Moreover, a court in this district \n12 \n13  concluded that “Section 102 clearly manifests congressional intent to preempt state and \n14 \nlocal laws which would interfere with Congress’s objective to expeditiously construct the \n15 \nborder fence.”  Cnty. of El Paso, 2005 WL 4372693, at *10 (concluding that under \n16 \n17  section 102(c), state and local laws would be preempted if the state’s enforcement of its \n18 \nstatute interfered with federal objective and waiver statute did not violate the Tenth \n19 \nAmendment).  California has not demonstrated that it has autonomy or authority in \n20 \n21  regulating its border with Mexico.  Moreover, as to the principal of equal sovereignty, \n22 \nsection 102 applies with equal force to any state that borders the United States.  \n23 \nInevitably all states are not border states, and section 102 does not single out a particular \n24 \n25  state in imposing requirements on state powers in a discriminatory manner as the VRA in \n26 \nShelby.  \n27 \n97 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2032   Page 98 of 101\n \n1    Next, California argues that section 102 interferes with its police powers relying on \n2 \nCity of Boerne.  In City of Boerne, a local zoning authority denied a church a building \n3 \npermit, and the Supreme Court held that the Religious Freedom Reformation Act \n4 \n5  (“RFRA”) was unconstitutional as applied to the states because it was beyond Congress’s \n6 \nremedial power to regulate states under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n7 \nConstitution.  City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 536.  Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment \n8 \n9  grants Congress broad authority to remedy and deter constitutional violations.  Id. at 518.   \n10 \nThe Court noted that RFRA was not remedial or preventive legislation but instead an \n11 \nattempt at “substantive change in constitutional protections.”  Id. at 532.  The scope and \n12 \n13  reach of RFRA was overly broad, as it applied to every agency and official in federal, \n14 \nstate and local governments and to any federal and state law, and was temporally broad \n15 \nwith no termination date.  Id.   \n16 \n17    The Court does not find City of Boerne supportive of California’s argument.  First, \n18 \nCity of Boerne did not involve a claim of a Tenth Amendment violation but addressed \n19 \nCongress’ authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, a distinct provision \n20 \n21  of the Constitution.  California claims its police powers, to legislate for the public good, \n22 \nis being curtailed by section 102 and that section 102(c) is grossly overbroad as it allows \n23 \nfor the waiver of “all federal and state law.”  While the language of section 102(c) is \n24 \n25  broad since it applies to a waiver of “all legal requirements” the waiver is circumscribed \n26 \nto those the Secretary determines are “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the \n27 \n98 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2033   Page 99 of 101\n \n1  barriers and roads.”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(c).  The two waivers at issue are limited to the \n2 \n“construction of roads and physical barriers . . . in the Project Area.”  (Dkt. No. 30-6, \n3 \nCayaban Decl., Ex. 11, 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985; id., Ex. 12, 82 Fed. Reg. at 42830.)  \n4 \n5  Contrary to Plaintiff’s position, section 102’s granting the Secretary authority to waive \n6 \nstate laws is not indefinite in duration and unlimited.  Moreover, as noted by a district \n7 \ncourt, section 102 does not abrogate the validity of state laws but “merely suspend[s] the \n8 \n9  effects of the state and local laws.”  Cnty. of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *8.   \n10 \n  The Court concludes that California Plaintiff’s Tenth Amendment claim is without \n11 \nmerit, and GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and DENIES California \n12 \n13  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on this issue.  \n14 \n  G.  Whether Constitutional Avoidance Compels a Ruling that the August 2 \n15 \nWaiver is Ultra Vires to section 102 \n16 \n17    In their reply, Coalition Plaintiffs, for the first time, assert that judicial review of \n18 \nsections 102(a) and (b) is necessary to avoid serious constitutional problems.  They argue \n19 \nthat there are serious constitutional concerns because section 102(c) grants an unelected \n20 \n21  cabinet official with unbridled power to waive any law that has any remote connection to \n22 \nborder security projects.  Center Plaintiff also raises for the first time in its reply that the \n23 \ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance compels a holding that the August 2 Waiver is ultra \n24 \n25  vires to section 102.  In their reply, Defendants summarily argue that the canon of \n26 \n27 \n99 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2034   Page 100 of 101\n \n1  constitutional avoidance does not apply since the challenges are not serious enough based \n2 \non the plain text of section 102.    \n3 \n  “The so-called canon of constitutional avoidance is an interpretive tool, counseling \n4 \n5  that ambiguous statutory language be construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.”  \n6 \nFCC v. Fox Tel. Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009) (citation omitted).  If  \n7 \n“the statute does not raise constitutional concerns, then there is no basis for employing \n8 \n9  the canon of constitutional avoidance.”  Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1140 (9th \n10 \nCir. 2013) (citation omitted).  Moreover, if there is no ambiguity in the statute, \n11 \nconstitutional avoidance has no application.  Warger v. Shauers, 135 S. Ct. 521, 529 \n12 \n13  (2014) (Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) is not ambiguous).   \n14 \n  “It is a bedrock principle of statutory interpretation that ‘where an otherwise \n15 \nacceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court \n16 \n17  will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly \n18 \ncontrary to the intent of Congress.’”  Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 690 (9th Cir. 2017) \n19 \n(quoting Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, \n20 \n21  485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988)).  The constitutional avoidance doctrine may be invoked only if \n22 \nthe court has “grave doubts” about the statute’s constitutionality.  Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 565 \n23 \nF.3d 1126, 1143 (9th Cir. 2009); Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 238 \n24 \n25  (1998) (“those who invoke the doctrine must believe that the alternative is a serious \n26 \nlikelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional.”).   \n27 \n100 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 50   Filed 02/27/18   PageID.2035   Page 101 of 101\n \n1    As discussed above, the Court does not have serious constitutional doubts as to the \n2 \nconstitutionality of section 102(c).  Moreover, prior challenges to the initial amendment \n3 \nof section 102(c) broadening its waiver authority in 2005 have been upheld as \n4 \n5  constitutional.  Accordingly, the Court declines to apply the doctrine of constitutional \n6 \navoidance.    \n7 \nCONCLUSION \n8 \n9    Based on the reasoning above, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motions for summary \n10 \njudgment and GRANTS Defendants’ motions for summary judgment with the exception \n11 \nof the Center Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action for FOIA violations.   \n12 \n13    IT IS SO ORDERED.   \n14 \nDated:  February 27, 2018   \n15 \n16 \n \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n101 \n28 \n17cv1215-GPC(WVG) \nConsolidated with: \n17cv1873-GPC(WVG) \n17cv1911-GPC(WVG) \n ",

That reading, however, cannot be squared with the clear statutory limits \n4 imposed by congress, which renders the waivers here ultra vires, a conclusion this Court \n5 has the authority to reach. Section I. And even if the Government’s broad reading of \n6 section 102 were adopted by this Court, it would simply mean the statutory scheme lacks \n7 the “clearly delineated general policy” or “boundaries of the delegated authority” \n8 required to survive constitutional scrutiny under the non-delegation doctrine. Section II-\n9 A. Either way, the Coalition Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment, because either \n10 the Secretary’s conduct exceeds the clear statutory mandates or those statutory mandates \n11 are essentially illusory rendering section 102 unconstitutional.  \n12\nARGUMENT \n13\nI.  THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ NON-\n14 CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS \n15 A.  The Government’s Response demonstrates why this Court must \nexercise its ultra vires jurisdiction. \n16\nThe Government’s Response fails to identify any case that adopts the result it seeks \n17\nto compel here: complete elimination of all judicial review of even facially ultra vires \n18\nactions in excess of an agency’s statutory grant of authority. Whether as a matter of \n19\ninherent judicial authority1 or statutory construction, in every case where a court faced \n20\n21\n                                           \n22\n1 The Government takes issue with the Coalition Plaintiffs’ characterization of this \n23 authority as an inherent judicial power. Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 35-1) \n(hereinafter “Defs. Br.”) at 18 n.10. Yet, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly authorized such \n24\npower even in the face of “absolute” bars on judicial review, infra, strongly suggesting \n25 the authority was an inherent judicial one. The ultra vires claim itself stems from inherent \njudicial authority rather than statute. See Hawaii v. Trump, Case No. 17-17168, 2017 WL \n26\n6554184, at *9 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017). The Ninth Circuit also has followed the D.C. \n27 Circuit in this context, where courts have recognized this inherent judicial power. E.g., \nAdamski v. Hart, 14-cv-0094, 2015 WL 4624007, at *6 (D.D.C. July 31, 2015) (an “ultra \n28\n \nCOAL. PLS.’ RESP. & REPLY MEM.  - 1 -  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 38   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1301   Page 8 of 27\n \n1 clear ultra vires conduct, such as the situation here, some avenue of judicial relief was \n2 identified. The Ninth Circuit, for example, has repeatedly held it has such jurisdiction and \n3 authority even in the face of “absolute” bars on judicial review. E.g., Markham v. United \n4 States, 434 F.3d 1185, 1187 (9th Cir. 2006) (“The courts have fashioned two narrow \n5 exceptions to this absolute jurisdictional bar. Courts retain jurisdiction to consider \n6 constitutional challenges or claims for violation of a clear statutory mandate or \n7 prohibition,” emphasis added); Staacke v.

There is simply no credible reason to conclude that \n12 Congress would intend to shield from judicial review conduct that clearly violated \n13 Congress’s own statutorily imposed limits. Indeed, if Congress did intend such a result—\n14 as the Government asserts—it would render the statutory scheme unconstitutional as an \n15 essentially unlimited and unbridled grant of authority. See, infra, Section II.  \n16 Even in the Government’s primary case, Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. \n17 MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32 (1991), the Supreme Court was careful to emphasize its \n18 holding was based on the critical fact that Congress had provided MCorp “an \n19 unquestioned right to review of both the regulation and its application,” in the Circuit \n20 Court of Appeals.

Cir. 2003) (it “is clear that judicial review is available when an \n25\nagency acts ultra vires,” even where Congress seeks to bar all review, because the claim \n26 derives from historic judicial authority). Regardless, whether as a matter of inherent \njudicial authority or statutory construction, the result is the same, and this Court has the \n27\nauthority to strike down the Secretary’s ultra vires acts. \n28\nCOAL.

And \n2 it was because the statute “expressly provides MCorp with a meaningful and adequate \n3 opportunity for judicial review of the validity of the source of strength regulation,” that \n4 the Court held the district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the ongoing proceedings. Id. \n5  Thus, MCorp does not stand for the proposition that Congress is empowered to \n6 eliminate all judicial review of agency conduct even where, as here, it exceeds the clear \n7 limits of statutory authority. If that were so the existence of another avenue of meaningful \n8 and adequate judicial review would have been an unnecessary component of the Court’s \n9 analysis, not a central one.  \n10 There can be no clearer statutory mandate than the one included in section \n11 102(c)(1): Congress only intended the extraordinary waiver authority to be used when it \n12 was actually “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under \n13 this section.” (emphasis added); see generally Coal.

Defs. Br. at 32-33. It was as part of this specific exigent time \n18 period that Congress granted the extraordinary waiver authority to the Secretary to allow \n19 her to complete the specific projects mandated by Congress.  \n20 Yet, the Government must also concede that no similar congressional action has \n21 occurred for nearly a decade during which time the projects now sought to be conducted \n22 could have been performed. The lack of similar congressional action—demanding these \n23 projects be completed—for such a significant period of time is a significant factor cutting \n24 against the Government’s interpretation. Notably, the Government relies exclusively on \n25 the Secretary’s ipse dixit assertion regarding necessity: it points to no actual evidentiary \n26 support that would suggest the waiver was necessary.

Rather, they are ultra vires acts \n4 that facially exceed that plain statutory mandate. \n5 The nature of the projects themselves further demonstrate the waivers are not \n6 necessary. Unlike the prior projects that were addressing critical gaps in the border \n7 infrastructure, see Coal. Pls. Br. at 18-20, the current projects are, at most, minor \n8 improvements to already existing effective barriers. As the Government notes, the \n9 “replacement” barriers are somewhat “taller” with “other features making them more \n10 operationally effective.” Defs. Br. at 42.

Such simplification, however, ignores the canons of statutory construction and \n5 the absence of “clear and convincing evidence” that Congress intended to preclude \n6 judicial review of the non-waiver requirements it placed in section 102. \n7 2.  Actions taken under subsections 102(a) and (b) are final agency actions. \n8 The Government brushes aside Plaintiffs’ Second Claim for Relief, alleging the \n9 Secretary’s actions pursuant to subsection 102(a) and subparagraph 102(b)(1)(C) are final \n10 agency actions which are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \n11 in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. § \n12 706(2).” Coal. Pls.’ 1st Am. Compl. (ECF No. 23) at ¶ 93. The totality of Defendants’ \n13 response to this argument is that “the only final agency actions that Plaintiffs challenge \n14 are the issuance of the waivers.” Defs. Br. at 14, n. 5. Other than this conclusory footnote, \n15 Defendants fail to provide a basis for the assertion that no other final agency action can \n16 occur under section 102. The Secretary’s actions taken pursuant to subsections 102(a) \n17 and (b), however, are reviewable, final agency actions. \n18 As recognized in Save Our Heritage Organization, the Secretary’s authority to \n19 construct border barriers under section 102 is “derived from subsection (a).” 533 F. Supp. \n20 2d at 61. Further, subsection 102(b) provides the Secretary the means to “carry[] out” \n21 Congress’s directive set forth in subsection (a), and imposes additional specific \n22 requirements as well. Id. at 60; IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A). Paragraph 102(c)(1) merely \n23 provides the Secretary a tool she may employ when she deems waiving laws is \n24 “necessary to ensure expeditious construction,” not the authority for the construction of \n25 border infrastructure itself. That authority is found in sections (a) and (b) alone. These \n26 two sections provide all the Secretary’s authority to construct border infrastructure under \n27\n28\nCOAL.

Research Serv., R43975, Barriers Along \n4 the U.S. Borders: Key Authorities and Requirements 21 (2017).4  \n5 Given that subsections 102(a) and (b) are available to the Secretary independently \n6 from 102(c)—which does not affect (a) and (b), see Part I.B.II.2 infra—the question is \n7 simply whether they are final agency actions subject to review under the APA. Plaintiffs \n8 assert they are, and the Government’s contradictory conclusion does not withstand \n9 scrutiny. The APA provides that “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final \n10 agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to \n11 judicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. Since no other statute makes the actions in subsections \n12 102(a) and (b) at issue in this case reviewable, they are reviewable directly under the \n13 APA as final agency actions. “Agency action” includes “the whole or a part of an agency \n14 rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.” \n15 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The scope of judicial review prescribed requires courts to “hold \n16 unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be” in violation \n17 of the requirements of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n18 Whether these acts are final “is determined not ‘by the administrative agency’s \n19 characterization of its action, but rather by a realistic assessment of the nature and effect \n20 of the order sought to be reviewed.’” Adenariwo v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 808 F.3d 74, 78 \n21 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). “Finality,” moreover, “is a pragmatic, flexible \n22 concept,” Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of Ft. Peck Indian Reservation v. Bd. of Oil & Gas \n23 Conservation of State of Mont., 792 F.2d 782, 789 (9th Cir. 1986). In general,  \n24 two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be “final”: First, the \n25                                            \n26 3 At least prior to December 31, 2008. See Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Tit. V § 564. \n4 Prior to August 2, 2017, the last waiver was issued on April 8, 2017. See 73 Fed. Reg. \n27\n19,078 (Apr. 8, 2008). \n28\nCOAL.

And \n2\nsecond, the action must be one by which “rights or obligations have been \n3 determined,” or from which “legal consequences will flow,”  \n4 Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (citations omitted).  \n5 These requirements are met here. First, pursuant to subsection 102(a), the \n6 Secretary found it “necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads.” Second, \n7 these actions “alter the legal regime to which the action agency is subject,” id. at 178, by \n8 allowing the Secretary to pursue “[c]onstruction of fencing and road improvements along \n9 the border” in accordance with subsection (b). The decision to invoke waivers pursuant to \n10 102(c)(1) is irrelevant to the agency actions that result in actual construction. The \n11 Waivers are distinct final actions for which Congress has provided judicial review limited \n12 to constitutional claims, albeit improperly. Regardless, since subsections 102(a) and (b) \n13 are final agency actions and outside the scope of subparagraph 102(c)(2)(A), the Court \n14 may review these actions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).5 \n15 3.  The jurisdictional-restricting provision in subparagraph \n102(c)(2)(A) is limited to subsection 102(c). \n16\nBy claiming subsections 102(a) and (b) are subject to the (c) judicial review, the \n17\nGovernment also contradicts its conclusion that actions under subsections 102(a) and (b) \n18\nare not final agency actions. Such a reading of the statute contravenes legal precedent. \n19\nCoalition Plaintiffs agree with the Government’s Response “the statutory text is plain \n20\nenough to dispose of the question,” Defs. Br. at 10-11, of whether intended to bar all \n21\njudicial review of non-constitutional claims, but it presents the incorrect conclusion under \n22\npretext of ordinary interpretation.

The attempt to extend reach of subparagraph 102(c)(2)(A) beyond \n2 subsection 102(c) is an exercise of artful distraction. \n3 As an example, to support the notion that the court is stripped of jurisdiction over \n4 the entirety of section 102, Defendants must read the final sentence of subparagraph \n5 (2)(A) in isolation. See Defs. Br. at 12. Statutory language, however, “cannot be \n6 construed in a vacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words \n7 of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall \n8 statutory scheme.” Sturgeon v. Frost, 136 S. Ct. 1061, 1070 (2016) (quoting Roberts v. \n9 Sea–Land Services, Inc., 132 S.Ct. 1350, 1357 (2012); see also Graham Cty. Soil & \n10 Water Conservation Dist. v. U.S. ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 (2005) (“Statutory \n11 language has meaning only in context.”); King v. St. Vincent’s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221 \n12 (1991) (“the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context”).  \n13 Context, plain meaning, and legislative history confirm the limited applicability of \n14 102(c)(1). Subparagraph (c)(2)(A) of provides: \n15 In general.—The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive \njurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, \n16\nor any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n17 paragraph (1). A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a \nviolation of the Constitution of the United States. The court shall not have \n18\njurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph. \n19\nThe reference to “paragraph (1)” concerning exclusive jurisdiction is a reference to \n20\nthe waiver authority in paragraph 102(c)(1), and the reference to this “subparagraph” is to \n21\n(c)(2)(A). Both references are clear and unambiguous. In subparagraph 102(c)(2)(A), \n22\nCongress was very specific about its reference to “paragraph (1)” and used the phrase \n23\n“this subparagraph” within subparagraph (c)(2)(A), the only topic of which is the waiver \n24\nauthority. Had the Congress intended to limit judicial review to decisions under other \n25\nsubsections, it needed to do so explicitly and would have added new subsection (d) that \n26\nwould cover 102(a), (b), and (c). See Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 63-\n27\n64 (1993) (courts “find an intent to preclude” judicial review “only if presented with \n28\nCOAL.

When read with the preceding \n5 two sentences, this sentence is an affirmative statement regarding the scope of a court’s \n6 jurisdiction to review waiver decisions. The third sentence serves only as a limitation on \n7 the grant of jurisdiction in the two previous sentences—for courts to hear causes of action \n8 concerning waivers—and does not impliedly limit causes of actions unrelated to waiver \n9 decisions. See McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991) (Congress \n10 presumed to have knowledge of rules of statutory construction and the “well-settled \n11 presumption favoring interpretations … that allow judicial review”). \n12 Legislative history reinforces this conclusion. The original, limited subsection \n13 102(c) waiver enacted in 1996 contained no judicial review restrictions. When Congress \n14 expanded the waiver in the REAL ID Act and limited judicial review, it did so in the \n15 same subsection (c). Its failure to add a new subsection indicates that subparagraph \n16 (2)(A) applies only to waiver decisions. Amendments to section 102 made by the \n17 Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V § 564 \n18 (Dec. 26, 2007), further undermine the judicial review restrictions extending beyond the \n19 waivers. When Congress added the consultation requirement in 102(b)(1)(C)—two years \n20 after expanding the waiver provision in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, \n21 Div. B—it also included a savings provision, which, in part, states: “Nothing in this \n22 subparagraph [regarding consultation] may be construed to—“(I) create or negate any \n23 right of action for a State, local government, or other person or entity affected by this \n24 subsection.” IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(C)(ii). If judicial review of 102(a) and (b) was barred or \n25 limited to constitutional challenges, this language would be unnecessary. Such a \n26 construction must be avoided. Burrey v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 159 F.3d 388, 394 (9th \n27 Cir. 1998) (court “must avoid any construction that renders some of its language \n28 superfluous.”); see also McDonnell v. United States, 136 S.

As passed by the \n4 House, paragraph 102(c)(2) would have required allowed “no judicial review,” and was \n5 explicitly limited to waivers. H.R. 418, 109th Cong. § 102 (2005) (prohibition limited to \n6 “any cause or claim arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the \n7 Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1)”), an understanding expressed \n8 by House representatives. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. E243 (daily ed. Feb. 15, 2005) \n9 (statement of Rep. Udall (bill “removes any judicial review of the waiving of these \n10 laws.”); 151 Cong. Rec. H556 (daily ed.

(bill \n11 “removes judicial review from such waiver decisions”)); id. at H559 (statement of Rep. \n12 Jackson-Lee (“bill also removes any judicial review of the waiving of these laws.  \n13 The Senate never took up discussion of section 102, as the REAL ID Act was \n14 included as part of an emergency appropriations bill. In conference, the 102(c) that \n15 passed the House was revised in several respects, including not mandating the Secretary \n16 to use waivers and providing for some judicial review of waivers. See H.R. Rep. 109-72, \n17 at 171-72 (2005) (Conf. Rep.). Given that every change to subsection 102(c) moderated \n18 the Secretary’s authority and restrictions on review, concluding that the Conferees meant \n19 to broaden the scope of 102(c)(2)(A) is illogical, and the language amended in conference \n20 should not be read to restrict review more so than that of H.R. 418. \n21 The Secretary, therefore, cannot seek to evade the consequences of this language \n22 by seeking to indirectly preclude judicial review by waiving the applicability of the APA. \n23 4.

United States, \n3 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). \n4 Despite the lack of definitions in section 102, there are meaningful standards for \n5 the Court to apply to the requirements of 102(a) and (b), such as the “areas high illegal \n6 entry” and “vicinity of the United States border.” When a statute does not define a term, \n7 courts “interpret that term by employing the ordinary, contemporary, and common \n8 meaning of the words.” Arizona v. Tohono O’odham Nation, 818 F.3d 549, 556 (9th Cir. \n9 2016) (citation omitted)); see also, e.g., Crawford v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & \n10 Davidson Cty., 555 U.S. 271, 276 (2009) (words undefined in statutes carry their ordinary \n11 meaning). This is just what the court in United States v. 1.16 Acres of Land, More or \n12 Less, Situate in Cameron County., Texas did to interpret IIRIRA provision authorizing \n13 acquisition of lands “adjacent to” and “in the vicinity of” the border. 585 F.Supp.2d 901, \n14 907 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (analyzing terms in subsection 102(a) and 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(1)). \n15 Here, the meaning of “high” as used in “areas of high illegal entry” connotes a \n16 relative description, such as “high illegal entry” as compared to other “areas.” See \n17 Merriam-Webster, high (updated Jan. 1, 2018), https://www.merriam-webster.com/\n18 dictionary/high (“1a: rising or extending upward … c: … passing above the normal level \n19 … 2a(1): advanced toward the acme or culmination … 8: of greater degree, amount … \n20 than average, usual, or expected”). Thus, “areas of high illegal entry” must at least mean \n21 the opposite of “areas of low illegal entry” in comparison. See Fisher v. Tucson Unified \n22 Sch. Dist., No. CV-74-00090-TUC-DCB, 2017 WL 5167238, at *3 (D. Ariz. Nov. 8, \n23 2017) (Court assuming that “a ‘high-achieving’ school … to be the opposite of ‘schools \n24 in which students are underachieving academically.’) \n25 Defendants’ insist, however, on interpreting the phrase “areas of high illegal entry” \n26 to be equivalent to those areas over which Border Patrol lacks “operational control.” See, \n27 e.g., Defs.

No. 109-367 § 2(b)).6 If this were the standard \n2 Congress intended, however, there would be no need for the specific barrier construction \n3 authority in section 102 because of Secretary’s general authority to build border control \n4 facilities found in 8 U.S.C. § 1103. Supposing Congress did intend to grant the Secretary \n5 authority to waive laws virtually anywhere along the borders, there would also be no \n6 need for including any limiting language.7 \n7 Further, once the Secretary made the decision to use the authority of subsection \n8 102(a), she was bound to follow the procedure and limitations set forth by Congress in \n9 subsection 102(b). The record does not document that the Secretary complied with the \n10 requirements set forth in (b). Specifically, subparagraph 102(b)(1)(C) requires the \n11 Secretary to consult not only with other federal agencies but “States, local governments, \n12 Indian tribes, and property owners” as well.

In the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649 § \n24 542 (Nov. 29, 1990), Congress authorized the use of these funds “for the repair, \nmaintenance, or construction on the United States border, in areas experiencing high \n25\nlevels of apprehensions of illegal aliens, of structures to deter illegal entry into the United \n26 States.” Id. at § 542(a) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1330(b)(3)(A)(iii). Pre-dating IIRIRA, this \nphrase is more valuable for determining Congress’s intent for “areas of high illegal entry” \n27\nthan the dissimilar, post-REAL ID Act language suggested by the Defendants. \n28\nCOAL.

Ongoing discussions with CPB’s limited, agency-selected “relevant” \n2 stakeholders, however, falls short of the duties under subparagraph 102(b)(1)(C). \n3 C.  Judicial review of the subsections 102(a) and (b) is necessary to avoid \nserious constitutional problems. \n4\n5 If there is ambiguity in the reach 102(c), the canon of constitutional avoidance \n6 directs that the more limited restriction on judicial review prevails. Clark v. Martinez, \n7 543 U.S. 371, 385 (2005) (when “statute is found to be susceptible of more than one \n8 construction … the canon functions as a means of choosing between them.” (emphasis in \n9 original)). “When deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a \n10 court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice. If one of them would raise \n11 a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail.” Id. at 380-81.  \n12 Constitutional avoidance also explains why federal courts have not “struck down a \n13 challenged statute on delegation grounds” since 1935. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. \n14 361, 373 & n.7 (1989) (“nondelegation doctrine principally has been limited to the \n15 interpretation of statutory texts, and, more particularly, to giving narrow constructions to \n16 statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional.”). \n17 Accordingly, every previous court upholding the delegation of the Secretary’s waiver \n18 authority read subsection 102(c) narrowly and relied on phrases such as “necessary,” “in \n19 the vicinity of the … border,” and “areas of high illegal entry” as expressly limiting the \n20 Secretary’s authority. See Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 128 \n21 (D.D.C. 2007) (“Secretary may only exercise the waiver authority for the ‘narrow \n22 purpose’ prescribed by Congress” (quoting Sierra Club, No. 04-cv-272, p. 10, 2005 U.S. \n23 Dist.

Chertoff summarized,  \n2 to exercise the waiver authority…, Congress has required the Secretary to \ndetermine if the waiver is “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of \n3\nthe barriers and roads under …” … he is directed to construct fencing only \n4 “in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas \nof high illegal entry…” This … meets the requirements of the Supreme \n5\nCourt’s nondelegation cases. The “general policy” is “clearly delineated”—\n6 i.e. to expeditiously “install additional physical barriers and roads ... to deter \nillegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry.” And, the “boundaries” of the \n7\ndelegated authority are clearly defined by Congress’s requirement that the \n8 Secretary may waive only those laws … “necessary to ensure expeditious \nconstruction.” \n9\n10 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127 (citations omitted). \n11 These courts expected section 102’s limiting requirements to “meaningfully \n12 constrain” the Secretary’s discretion by creating “an intelligible principle to which the \n13 person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.” Touby v. United States, 500 \n14 U.S. 160, 165 (1991). Defendants, on the other hand, maintain that “[n]one of the \n15 statutory phrases unambiguously preclude the use of § 102(c) waiver authority for the \n16 construction projects.” Defs. Br. at 41; see also id. at p. 29, 31-32, 41-51. Under their \n17 argument, the Court can neither look to the facts surrounding these statutory phrases to \n18 determine whether the Secretary acted within the confines set by Congress in the \n19 statutory, nor apply them as constraints on Congress’s delegation of authority.  \n20 The Government should not be permitted to have its cake and eat it too. The Court \n21 must have jurisdiction over Defendants’ compliance with the restrictions Congress placed \n22 on the Secretary in subsections 102(a) and (b), or Congress violated nondelegation \n23 principles by granting the Secretary “unrestrained freedom of choice.” Freedom to Travel \n24 Campaign v. Newcomb, 82 F.3d 1431, 1437 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Zemel v. Rusk, 381 \n25 U.S. 1, 17 (1965)).

Section 102 delegates “forbidden legislative authority” in violation of \nArticle I, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. \n3\n4 The Government’s Response acknowledged that if section 102(c) failed to \n5 “clearly delineate[] [a] general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the \n6 boundaries of th[e] delegated authority,” then the delegation is unconstitutional under \n7 Article I, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Defs. Br. at 52-54; Coal. Pls. Br. at 21; Ctr. \n8 Br. at 35 citing Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372–73 (1989) (quoting Am. \n9 Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946)). Hoping to gloss over the \n10 particulars, the Response presented a superficial and circular construction of section \n11 102(c) that eliminates any distinction between the “general policy” and the “boundaries” \n12 within which the DHS Secretary must operate, defining the “general policy” as \n13 “improving border protection by expediting the construction of necessary borders and \n14 roads,” and the “boundaries” as waiving legal requirements “necessary to ensure \n15 expeditious construction” of walls in the “vicinity” of the border. Defs. Br. at 53- 54. \n16 Such circularity evidences an impermissible delegation of legislative authority because \n17 the purported boundaries simply reiterate the expansive goal, to build fences quickly, and \n18 provide no direction to the DHS Secretary on how to specifically implement that goal. \n19 Each of Mistretta’s three requirements serve a distinct purpose. The general policy \n20 “guide[s] the [designated agency] in applying the discretion delegated by the Act,” \n21 United States v. Cooper, 750 F.3d 263, 271-72 (3d Cir. 2014), and the “boundaries” are \n22 legislative determinations that supply an agency with the “specific tool” to use in \n23 carrying out Congress’s aim. Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 374; Cooper, 750 F.3d at 271–72; see \n24 United States v. Richardson, 754 F.3d 1143, 1145 (9th Cir. 2014) (adopting the reasoning \n25 in Cooper). This framework safeguards against Congress delegating its authority to an \n26 agency to decide “what [the law] shall be,” by providing clear instructions as to both the \n27 ends and the means. Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 418 (quoting Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 \n28 (1892)). Indeed, “[t]he very choice of which portion of the power to exercise—that is to \nCOAL.

Am. Trucking Assns., 531 \n3 U.S. 457, 473 (2001). \n4 Pointing to two words, “necessary” and “vicinity,” the Government’s Response \n5 argued that section 102 is “strikingly similar” to Clean Air Act section 109(b)(1), which \n6 the Supreme Court upheld as a constitutional delegation in Whitman. 531 U.S. at 476; \n7 Defs. Br. 54–55. Frankly, there is no comparison between the Clean Air Act’s exhaustive \n8 complexity and interrelated parts and section 102. The Court’s careful analysis in \n9 Whitman recognized the broader statutory scheme restricting agency discretion: “Since \n10 the first step in assessing whether a statute delegates legislative power is to determine \n11 what authority the statute confers, we address that issue of interpretation first,” in light of \n12 the plain meaning of the text, statutory framework, and legislative history. Id. at 465–72. \n13 Clean Air Act section 109(b)(1) directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n14 Administrator to set primary ambient air quality standards “based on” the criteria under \n15 section 108(a)(2),8 which described “in detail how the health effects of pollutants in \n16 ambient air are to be calculated and given effect.” Whitman, 531 U.S. at 465, 469. \n17 Importantly, Congress required EPA to incorporate the “latest scientific knowledge” and \n18 an evaluation of how air pollutants interact. 42 U.S.C. § 7408(a)(2). The Clean Air Act’s \n19 numerous provisions and its plain language further constrained agency discretion, \n20 rendering “implausible,” for example, an inference that the Administrator may consider \n21 costs. Whitman, 531 U.S. at 466-72. In this context, the Court concluded that section \n22 109(b)(1), and its “requisite to protect the public health” standard, provided a sufficient \n23 “intelligible principle” for guiding the Administrator. Id. at 475-76. \n24\n                                           \n25\n8 Section 109(b)(1) directed EPA to set primary ambient air quality standards “the \n26 attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on \nsuch criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the \n27\npublic health.” 42 U.S.C. § 7409(b)(1) (emphasis added). \n28\nCOAL.

Examining the REAL ID Act as a whole, or section 102 in isolation, the \n3 legislation still does not provide any criteria to guide her in determining which laws \n4 might be “necessary” to waive or what it means to be in the “vicinity” of the border. \n5 Instead, the provisions of section 102 simply repeat the broad directive to build \n6 “effective” walls quickly. The Response could not delineate where the Secretary’s \n7 discretion might end, and appear to concede the fact that the DHS Secretary could build \n8 walls and prototypes along the U.S.-Canada border, waiving even local public health and \n9 safety mandates. Coal. Pls. Br. at 15–16; Ctr. Br. at 21-22. While Congress need not \n10 “provide a ‘determinate criterion’” strictly bounding agency discretion, “it must provide \n11 substantial guidance.” Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475.9  \n12 To salvage section 102(c), the Government asks this court to skim over the \n13 nondelegation doctrine, directing focus instead on cases that address matters \n14 “traditionally designated to the Executive as part of his Commander-in-Chief power.” \n15 Defs. Br. at 56. In so doing, the Government compares building fences along the southern \n16 border to protecting the country after the September 11 terrorist attacks, In re Nat’l Sec. \n17 Agency Telecomm.

These cases have no application here. Generally, \n21 immigration—the target of the border wall—is a matter left to Congress. See Knauff, 338 \n22 U.S. at 543 (“Normally Congress supplies the conditions of the privilege of entry into the \n23 United States”).

Congress provided substantial guidance for \n26 setting air standards given the rule’s effect on the national economy.

Thus, the Government cannot escape \n5 a meaningful application of Mistretta, Touby, Whitman, and other precedent discussed \n6 herein by claiming section 102 falls uniquely within the Commander-in-Chief power. \n7 Nevertheless, even under the Response’s national security rubric, section 102(c) \n8 could not be upheld. Defs. Br. at 56. In each instance, Congress still provided substantial \n9 guidance to the Executive. For example, the delegation in Telecomm. Records arose in a \n10 comprehensive statute and allowed the Attorney General to immunize \n11 telecommunications companies from suits related to federal wiretapping only if \n12 “assistance was provided in narrowly defined circumstances or … no assistance was \n13 offered.” 671 F.3d at 900. The delegation in Loving allowed the President to set court \n14 martial penalties no higher than those allowed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \n15 517 U.S. at 769. And, the delegation in Knauff was effective only for the declared \n16 national emergency (World War II) and required the President to find that the person \n17 barred from entering the country threatened national security. 338 U.S. at 540-41, 544. \n18 Section 102(c) offers no such guidance or boundaries. \n19 B.  The Government fails to cite any case supporting Congress’s power to \neliminate both concurrent state and federal jurisdiction. \n20\n21 The Government points to no case that would authorize Congress to both eliminate \n22 concurrent state court jurisdiction without affirmatively vesting that judicial power in the \n23 federal courts. Indeed, in Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, 170 U.S. 511 \n24 (1898)—a case the Government asserts is fatal to the Coalition Plaintiffs’ theory—the \n25 Government’s truncated quote fails to include the critical point: Congress may only \n26 “revoke[] and extinguish[]” the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunes when “the \n27 subject-matter can constitutionally be made cognizable in the federal courts, and that, \n28 without an express provision to the contrary, the state courts will retain a concurrent \nCOAL.

The Government’s reliance on Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455 \n3 (1990) is similarly misplaced, because the Court there likewise recognized the “deeply \n4 rooted presumption in favor of concurrent state court jurisdiction” may only be overcome \n5 when Congress expressly “give[s] to the Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction” over the \n6 claim. Id. at 458-59 (quotations omitted).  \n7 In other words, these cases make clear that it is only when Congress affirmatively \n8 vests federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction that it has the power to remove concurrent \n9 jurisdiction of the state courts. Here, however, that is not what section 102 does—it seeks \n10 to eliminate both federal and state jurisdiction—which Congress lacks the power to do. \n11 Thus, to the extent this Court holds that this Court lacks jurisdiction over such claims, it \n12 would mean concurrent state court jurisdiction must then exist.10 \n13 CONCLUSION \n14 In sum, for all the foregoing reasons, those in the Coalition Plaintiffs’ Opening \n15 Brief, and those contained in the briefs filed by the State of California and Center for \n16 Biological Diversity, Defendants’ conduct here is unauthorized, unconstitutional, and \n17 void, and this Court is well within its judicial authority to declare precisely that and \n18 invalidate the waivers at issue here by granting the Coalition Plaintiffs summary \n19 judgment and denying Defendants’ cross-motion. \n20 /// \n/// \n21\n/// \n22 /// \n/// \n23\n/// \n24\n                                           \n25\n10 The Government asserts that the Coalition Plaintiffs failed to identify any liberty or \n26 property interest that would support a Due Process claim.

LITIG.  5 \n \nSUMMARY* \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Law / Homeland Security \n \n  The  panel  affirmed  the  district  court’s  summary \njudgment  entered  in  favor  of  the  U.S  Department  of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) in cases involving challenges \nby  the  State  of  California  and  environmental  groups  to \nDHS’s authority to expedite construction of border barriers \nnear San Diego and Calexico, California, and the Secretary \nof DHS’s August and September 2017 waivers of applicable \nenvironmental laws. \n \n  Pursuant to Executive Order 13,767, the Secretary of \nDHS  invoked  section  102(c)  of  the  Illegal  Immigration \nReform  and  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996 \n(“IIRIRA”) to waive federal laws with respect to border \nbarrier construction projects along the border between the \nUnited States and Mexico. \n \n  The plaintiffs’ “ultra vires claims” alleged that DHS \nexceeded its statutory authority in working on the border \nbarrier projects and issuing the related waivers in violation \nof  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”).    The \nplaintiffs’ “environmental claims” alleged that in planning \nand  building  the  border  barrier  projects,  DHS  violated \nfederal environmental laws. \n \n  As  a  threshold  matter,  the  panel  held  that  they  had \njurisdiction to consider the “predicate legal question” of \n                                                                                                 \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 6 of 30\n6  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nwhether IIRIRA authorized the contested projects.  Because \nneither IIRIRA nor the APA barred the panel’s review, the \npanel  turned  to  the  merits  of  the  ultra  vires  and \nenvironmental claims. \n \n  The panel held that the plain text of section 102(a) of \nIIRIRA  granted  DHS  authority  to  construct  the  border \nbarrier projects, and that grant of authority was not limited \nby section 102(b) of IIRIRA.  The panel concluded that the \ndistrict court correctly granted DHS summary judgment on \nthe  ultra  vires  claims.    The  panel  further  held  that  the \nenvironmental claims were precluded  by the Secretary’s \nwaiver  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  the \nCoastal Zone Management Act, and the APA.  The panel \nheld that it lacked jurisdiction to consider any argument \nchallenging the waivers themselves. \n \n  Judge Callahan dissented because she would read section \n102 of IIRIRA as limiting review of the district court’s \ndecision to review by certiorari in the Supreme Court; and \nshe would, accordingly, dismiss the appeals. \n \n \n \nCOUNSEL \n \nNoah  Golden-Krasner  (argued),  Julia  Forgie,  Jessica  B. \nStrobel,  Baine  P.

LITIG. \n \n§ 102(a).1  The Secretary also “ha[s] the authority to waive \nall  legal  requirements”  that,  in  the  “Secretary’s  sole \ndiscretion,”  are  “necessary  to  ensure  expeditious \nconstruction” of those barriers and roads.  Id. § 102(c)(1). \nThis appeal stems from a challenge by California and \nmultiple environmental groups to the agency’s authority to \nexpedite construction of border barriers near San Diego and \nCalexico,  California,  and  the  Secretary’s  August  and \nSeptember 2017 waivers of applicable environmental laws.  \nAs a threshold matter, we have jurisdiction to consider the \n“predicate legal question” of whether IIRIRA authorizes the \ncontested  projects.    Because  the  projects  are  statutorily \nauthorized and DHS has waived the environmental laws \nCalifornia and the environmental groups seek to enforce, we \naffirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment to \nDHS. \nBACKGROUND \nOn January 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued \nExecutive  Order  13,767,  directing  federal  agencies  to \n“deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation’s southern \nborder.”  82 Fed. Reg. 8793.  A focal point of that directive \nwas “the immediate construction of a physical wall,” to be \nplanned, designed, and built “[i]n accordance with existing \nlaw, including . . . IIRIRA.”  Id. at 8793–94.  The “wall” was \nto be a “secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier” \n                                                                                                 \n1 Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (codified as \namended at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note).  All section references are to IIRIRA \nunless otherwise indicated.  IIRIRA originally granted the Attorney \nGeneral this authority.  Congress transferred this authority to the DHS \nSecretary after creating DHS in 2002. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 9 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  9 \n \nalong the “contiguous land border between the United States \nand Mexico, including all points of entry.”  Id. at 8794. \nBy  March  2017,  DHS  had  begun  planning  projects \ncarrying out the Executive Order, including two relevant to \nthis appeal: \n•  The construction and evaluation of wall “prototypes” \nin  San  Diego  County,  California  (the  “Prototype \nProject”); and \n•  The  replacement  of  fourteen  miles  of  primary \nfencing and fourteen miles of secondary fencing in \nSan Diego County (the “San Diego Project”). \nOn August 2, 2017, the DHS Secretary2 published in the \nFederal Register a notice of determination concerning the \nPrototype Project and the San Diego Project (the “San Diego \nWaiver”).  See 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984 (Aug. 2, 2017).  The \nSecretary invoked section 102(c)’s grant of “authority to \nwaive all legal requirements that I, in my sole discretion, \ndetermine necessary to ensure the expeditious construction \nof barriers and roads authorized by section 102 of IIRIRA.”  \nId. at 35,984.  The San Diego Waiver asserted that the U.S. \nBorder Patrol’s “San Diego Sector remains an area of high \nillegal  entry  for  which  there  is  an  immediate  need  to \nconstruct additional border barriers and roads.”  Id.  The \ndesignated “Project Area”—extending fifteen miles inland \nfrom the Pacific Ocean—encompassed the Prototype and \nSan Diego Projects.  Id.  Having determined the action was \n                                                                                                 \n2 During this period, John Kelly, Elaine Duke, and Kirstjen Nielsen \nserved as DHS Secretary.  Because the identity of the Secretary who \ninitiated any given administrative action is not relevant to the legal issues \nin this appeal, we simply refer to the “Secretary” or “DHS Secretary.” \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 10 of 30\n10  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \n“necessary,” the Secretary invoked section 102(c) to “waive \nin their entirety” thirty-seven federal laws “with respect to \nthe construction of roads and physical barriers” in the Project \nArea.  Id. at 35,985. \nOn September 12, 2017, the Secretary again invoked \nsection 102’s  waiver  authority  in  another  notice  of \ndetermination  in  the  Federal  Register  (the  “Calexico \nWaiver”).  See 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829 (Sept. 12, 2017).  The \nCalexico Waiver pertained to the replacement of primary \nfencing  along  a  three-mile  segment  of  the  border  near \nCalexico, California (the “Calexico Project”).  Id. at 42,830.  \nThe Secretary asserted that, like the San Diego Sector, the \n“El Centro Sector [which includes Calexico] remains an area \nof high illegal entry for which there is an immediate need to \nconstruct  border  barriers  and  roads,”  and  designated  a \nProject  Area  for  the  replacement  fencing.    Id.    Again \ndeeming  the  action  “necessary,”  the  Secretary  waived \ntwenty-seven federal laws “with respect to the construction \nof roads and physical barriers” in the Project Area.  Id. \nWith one exception, construction on the Prototype, San \nDiego,  and  Calexico  Projects  (collectively  “the  border \nbarrier projects”) has already begun and is either complete \nor ongoing.  Construction on the San Diego secondary-fence \nreplacement  project  had  not  begun  when  DHS  filed  its \nAnswering Brief.  DHS maintains that project is still in the \npreliminary planning stage, and that the Secretary has not yet \ndetermined whether a waiver is necessary. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 11 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  11 \n \nThree sets of plaintiffs3 filed lawsuits against the federal \ngovernment4 to enjoin the border barrier projects and to \ndeclare the San Diego and Calexico Waivers unlawful.  The \ndistrict court consolidated the suits, finding that they shared \ncommon  legal  and  factual  issues.    California  and  the \nenvironmental groups asserted three types of claims.  The \n“ultra vires claims” alleged that DHS exceeded its statutory \nauthority  in  working  on  the  border  barrier  projects  and \nissuing the related waivers, thus violating the Administrative \nProcedure  Act  (“APA”),  5 U.S.C.  § 551  et  seq.    The \n“environmental  claims”  alleged  that  in  planning  and \nbuilding  the  border  barrier  projects,  DHS  violated \nenvironmental laws.5  Finally, the “constitutional claims” \nalleged that the waivers violated the U.S. Constitution. \nOn cross-motions, the district court granted summary \njudgment  to  DHS.    The  district  court  concluded  that \nIIRIRA’s jurisdictional bar, see § 102(c)(2)(A), prevented it \n                                                                                                 \n3  The  Plaintiffs-Appellants  (collectively  “California  and  the \nenvironmental groups”) are: (1) the State of California and the California \nCoastal  Commission  (collectively  “California”);  (2)  the  Center  for \nBiological Diversity (“CBD”); and (3) the Defenders of Wildlife, the \nSierra Club, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund (collectively the \n“Coalition”). \n4  The  Defendants-Appellees  (collectively  “DHS”  or  “the \nGovernment”) are: the United States of America; the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Secretary \nKirstjen Nielsen, in her official capacity; and Commissioner Kevin K. \nMcAleenan, in his official capacity. \n5 California and the environmental groups alleged that DHS violated \nthe  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  42  U.S.C.  § 4321  et  seq. \n(“NEPA”), the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq. \n(“CZMA”), and the APA.  DHS acknowledged that it did not comply \nwith NEPA or CZMA requirements. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 12 of 30\n12  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nfrom hearing the non-constitutional claims.  The district \ncourt went on to reject the constitutional claims. \nCalifornia, CBD, and the Coalition each appealed the \ndistrict  court’s  judgments  as  to  the  ultra  vires  and \nenvironmental claims, but not their constitutional claims.  \nWe consolidated the three appeals. \nANALYSIS \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nWe  review  the  district  court’s  grant  of  summary \njudgment de novo.  Wolfe v. BNSF Ry. Co., 749 F.3d 859, \n863 (9th Cir. 2014).  We must “determine, viewing the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \nwhether there are any genuine issues of material fact and \nwhether  the  district  court  correctly  applied  the  relevant \nsubstantive  law.”    Citicorp  Real  Estate,  Inc.  v.  Smith, \n155 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 1998).  In doing so, we do “not \nweigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but \nonly determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. \nII. JURISDICTION \nThe threshold question is whether we have jurisdiction \nto hear this appeal.  The answer depends on the scope of \nIIRIRA’s jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions. \nWe  begin  with  the  language  of  the  statute,  which \nprovides: \nThe district courts of the United States shall \nhave exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes \nor claims arising from any action undertaken, \nor any decision made, by the Secretary of \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 13 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  13 \n \nHomeland Security pursuant to paragraph \n(1).  A cause of action or claim may only be \nbrought  alleging  a  violation  of  the \nConstitution of the United States.  The court \nshall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim \nnot specified in this subparagraph. \n§ 102(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  Paragraph (1), IIRIRA’s \nwaiver provision, states: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall \nhave  the  authority  to  waive  all  legal \nrequirements  such  Secretary,  in  such \nSecretary’s  sole  discretion,  determines \nnecessary to ensure expeditious construction \nof the barriers and roads under this section.  \nAny such decision by the Secretary shall be \neffective upon being published in the Federal \nRegister. \n§ 102(c)(1). \nSection 102(c)(2)(C) provides for direct review of the \ndistrict  court’s  decision  by  the  Supreme  Court:  “An \ninterlocutory  or  final  judgment,  decree,  or  order  of  the \ndistrict court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ \nof certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.” \nThe statutory directive is clear: \n•  IIRIRA  vests  district  courts  with  exclusive \njurisdiction to hear claims “arising from” actions \nundertaken  or  decisions  made  “pursuant  to”  the \nwaiver provision. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 14 of 30\n14  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \n•  This  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  claims  “arising \nfrom”  the  waiver  provision  is  limited  to \nconstitutional violations; there is no judicial review \nof  non-constitutional  claims  “arising  from”  the \nwaiver provision. \n•  The direct review provision applies only to those \nclaims  subject  to  the  district  courts’  exclusive \njurisdiction. \nThe jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions cover \nonly claims “arising from” paragraph (1)’s waiver provision.  \nInterpreting their scope requires determining when a claim \n“aris[es] from” the waiver provision. \nA claim does not “aris[e] from” the waiver provision \nsimply  because  it  is  related  to  or  concerned  with  the \nSecretary’s waiver determinations.  The language used in \nsection 102(c)(2)(A) requires more.  The Ninth Circuit has \nnoted that a related phrase, “arising out of,” is “ordinarily \nunderstood to mean ‘originating from,’ ‘having its origin in,’ \n‘growing out of’ or ‘flowing from’ or in short, ‘incident to, \nor having connection with.’”  See In re Tristar Esperanza \nProps., LLC, 782 F.3d 492, 497 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nUnderwriters at Lloyd’s of London v. Cordova Airlines, Inc., \n283 F.2d 659, 664 (9th Cir. 1960)).  Accordingly, a claim \n“aris[es] from” an “action undertaken” or “decision made[ ] \nby the Secretary . . . pursuant to” the waiver provision only \nwhen the claim originates or stems from a section 102(c)(1) \nwaiver  determination.6    Whether  the  jurisdictional  bar \n                                                                                                 \n6 In isolation, the reference in Tristar to “having connection with” \nmight support a broader reading of this nexus requirement.  782 F.3d at \n497.

LITIG.  15 \n \napplies to California and the environmental groups’ claims \nrequires us to assess whether each claim “aris[es] from” the \nSecretary’s waiver determinations. \nOne set of ultra vires claims alleges that the border \nbarrier projects are not authorized by the grant of barrier- and \nroad-building authority in sections 102(a) and 102(b).  They \nchallenge the scope of the Secretary’s authority to build \nroads and walls under sections 102(a) and 102(b), not the \nscope  of  waiver  authority  under  section 102(c).    These \nclaims thus “aris[e] from” sections 102(a) and 102(b), not \nsection 102(c).  Their origin is the initial decision to build \nthe border barrier projects, not the later decision to issue a \nwaiver related to those projects.  In the absence of any \nrelationship between these claims and the waiver provision, \nthere is no plausible interpretation of “aris[es] from” that \nbrings these claims under the jurisdictional bar.  On the other \nhand, a second set of ultra vires claims alleges the waivers \nthemselves were not authorized by the Secretary’s authority \nunder section 102(c)(1).  See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. at \n34–38, In re: Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., No. 3:17-\ncv-01215-GPC-WVG  (S.D.  Cal.  Sept.  6,  2017).    These \nclaims do “arise from” the Secretary’s waiver determination, \nso the district court correctly found that the jurisdictional bar \napplies.7 \n                                                                                                 \nqualifier, “in short,” which indicates that any subsequent terms are a \nmere rephrasing of the preceding substantive definitions. \n7 The district court was also correct in reasoning that the exception \nlaid out in  Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184 (1958), does not create \njurisdiction over these claims.  Leedom’s extremely narrow exception \nwould  apply  only  if  the  waivers  violated  “‘clear  and  mandatory’ \nstatutory language.”  Pac. Mar. Ass’n v. NLRB, 827 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th \nCir. 2016) (quoting Leedom, 358 U.S. at 188).  Contrary to California \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 16 of 30\n16  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nThe  environmental  claims  allege  the  planning  and \nconstruction of the border barrier projects violated various \nenvironmental laws.  To the extent these claims challenge \neither  the  merits  of  the  waivers  themselves,  or  the \nSecretary’s  authority  to  issue  the  waivers  under \nsection 102(c), they are subject to the jurisdictional bar.  But, \nthe analysis is different for the environmental claims that \n“aris[e] from” alleged violations of NEPA, CZMA, and the \nAPA during the planning and construction of the border \nbarrier projects.  At least some of the environmental claims \nclearly fall into this latter category.  For example, CBD \nraised NEPA and APA claims before the Secretary published \nthe San Diego or Calexico Waivers, meaning the waivers \ncould not possibly have been the source of these claims.  See \nFirst Am. Compl. at 3–4, 23–32, In re: Border Infrastructure \nEnvtl. Litig., No. 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG (S.D. Cal. July \n7,  2017).    To  be  sure,  a  valid  waiver  of  the  relevant \nenvironmental laws under section 102(c) is an affirmative \ndefense to all the environmental claims.8  But the fact that \nthe waivers may be dispositive of the environmental claims \ndoes not make a waiver the origin of those claims. \n                                                                                                 \nand  the  environmental  groups’  reading,  it  is  far  from  “clear”  that \nsection 102(c)(1) does not authorize the waivers.  By authorizing any \nwaiver “necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and \nroads  under  this  section,”  section 102(c)(1)  authorizes  waivers  to \nfacilitate construction authorized by section 102(a), including the border \nbarrier projects. \n8  California  and  the  environmental  groups  point  out  that  the \nenvironmental  review  requirements  for  NEPA  and  CZMA  became \neffective for the border barrier projects before the agency issued the \nwaivers.  But the waiver provision says nothing about when the agency \nmust invoke its authority, and we strain to see what relief could be \ngranted once DHS issued the waivers. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 17 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  17 \n \nThe  black  letter  law  of  federal  question  jurisdiction \nillustrates why any other outcome would be at odds with \nwell-accepted principles.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, district \ncourts have jurisdiction over all cases “arising under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  A case \ndoes not “aris[e] under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of \nthe United States” just because a defendant invokes a federal \ndefense.    See  Louisville  &  Nashville  R.R.  v.  Mottley, \n211 U.S.  149,  152  (1908).    For  the  same  reason,  the \nenvironmental claims do not “aris[e] from” the Secretary’s \nwaiver determinations merely because those waivers could \nprovide the Secretary with a viable defense. \nFinally, the constitutional claims, which allege that the \nwaiver  determinations  themselves  violate  the  U.S. \nConstitution, do “aris[e] from” the waiver determinations.  \nSee, e.g., Compl. at 23, Defs. of Wildlife v. DHS, No. 3:17-\ncv-01873-GPC-WVG (S.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2017) (arguing \nthe San Diego and Calexico Waivers violate the Presentment \nClause).    Because  these  claims  grow  out  of  the  waiver \ndeterminations, IIRIRA’s jurisdictional bar applies.  The \ndistrict court had exclusive jurisdiction to hear those claims, \nand any appeal must be direct to the Supreme Court pursuant \nto section 102(c)(2)(C).  It is no surprise that California and \nthe environmental groups did not appeal the constitutional \nclaims to the Ninth Circuit.9 \nThe jurisdictional bar and direct review provisions have \nno bearing on the ultra vires and environmental claims that \n                                                                                                 \n9 The Animal Legal Defense Fund, CBD, and Defenders of Wildlife \nfiled a petition for certiorari raising the constitutional claims, which the \nSupreme Court denied.  Animal Legal Def. Fund v. DHS, 139 S. Ct. 594 \n(2018). \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 18 of 30\n18  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \ndo  not  “aris[e]  from”  the  waiver  determination.10    The \ndistrict court had jurisdiction to review these federal claims \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  We, in turn, have jurisdiction to \nconsider this appeal from the “final decision[ ] of the district \ncourt[ ]” under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. \nNor does the APA bar our review.  California and the \nenvironmental groups seek relief for their ultra vires and \nenvironmental claims pursuant to the APA’s cause of action.  \nSee  5  U.S.C.  § 702.    DHS  argues  those  claims  are \nunreviewable because waiver determinations are made in the \nSecretary’s  “sole  discretion,”  IIRIRA  § 102(c)(1),  which \nmeans they are “committed to agency discretion by law” and \ntherefore exempt from the APA’s cause of action.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  However, this argument sidesteps the \nessence of the claims—that the border barrier projects are \nnot authorized under section 102(a) or 102(b).  The predicate \nlegal question of statutory authority is not committed to \nagency  discretion,  so  California  and  the  environmental \ngroups’ claims are reviewable. \nBecause neither IIRIRA nor the APA bar our review, we \nturn  to  the  merits  of  the  ultra  vires  and  environmental \nclaims. \nIII.  DHS  HAS  AUTHORITY  TO  CONSTRUCT  THE \nBORDER BARRIER PROJECTS \nAs noted, the ultra vires and environmental claims rely \non the APA, which provides the analytical framework for \nconsidering these claims.  Under the APA, the operative \n                                                                                                 \n10 This conclusion follows from the plain language of IIRIRA.  The \nstrong presumption of judicial review of agency action further supports \nthis outcome.  See Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC v. Lee, 136 S. Ct. 2131, \n2140 (2016). \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 19 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  19 \n \nquestion  is  whether  the  agency  action  is  “arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  The ultra vires claims relevant \nhere  allege  DHS  exceeded  its  statutory  authority  under \nsections 102(a)  and  102(b).    The  environmental  claims \nallege the border barrier projects are “not in accordance with \nlaw” because their planning and construction violated NEPA \nand CZMA. \nSection 102(a) vests the Secretary with authority to “take \nsuch  actions  as  may  be  necessary  to  install  additional \nphysical  barriers  and  roads  (including  the  removal  of \nobstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of \nthe United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of \nhigh illegal entry into the United States.” \nA.  The  border  barrier  projects  are  “additional \nphysical barriers.” \nThe Secretary authorized the San Diego and Calexico \nProjects because the existing barriers in those areas were \nbuilt in the 1990s using a fence design “that is no longer \noptimal for Border Patrol operations.”  82 Fed. Reg. 35,985, \n42,830.  According to DHS, the new construction erects \nstronger  and  taller  barriers.    The  Calexico  Project  will \nreplace  “[t]he  existing  fourteen  foot,  landing  mat-style \nfencing . . . with an eighteen to twenty-five foot barrier that \nemploys  a  more  operationally  effective  design.”    Id.  at \n42,830.    Similarly,  the  San  Diego  Project  “will  replace \nexisting primary fencing” with a “new primary barrier” that \n“use[s] an operationally effective design.”  Id. at 35,984–85.  \nThese are “additional physical barriers.” \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 20 of 30\n20  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nCalifornia and the environmental groups argue that the \nSan Diego and Calexico Projects—which replace existing \nborder fencing—are not authorized under section 102(a) \nbecause that section only applies to “additional physical \nbarriers.”11  They urge that “Congress understood the phrase \n‘install  additional  barriers’  to  mean  the  construction  of \nbarriers that would add to the total miles of already existing \nfences by installing new barriers where none existed at the \ntime.” \nThe plain language of section 102(a) suggests no such \nlimitation.    In  simple  terms,  “additional”  means \n“supplemental.”  Ojai Unified Sch. Dist. v. Jackson, 4 F.3d \n1467, 1472–73 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Town of Burlington \nv. Dep’t of Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 790 (1st Cir. 1984)).  A \n“barrier” is “a material object or set of objects that separates, \nkeeps apart, demarcates, or serves as a unit or barricade.”  \nSee Barrier, Webster’s New Int’l Dictionary of the English \nLanguage (3d ed. 1993).  Combining the plain meaning of \n“additional” and “barrier” yields a “supplemental material \nobject  or  set  of  objects  that  separates,  keeps  apart, \ndemarcates, or serves as a unit or barricade.”  A replacement \nfence fits comfortably within that definition. \nThat the statutory grant of authority extends beyond \n“install[ing] additional physical barriers” to “tak[ing] such \nactions as may be necessary to install additional physical \nbarriers and roads” further supports this conclusion.  IIRIRA \n§ 102(a)  (emphasis  added).    “[S]uch  actions”  include \n“remov[ing] . . . obstacles to detection of illegal entrants.”  \nId.  It follows that authorization to “remov[e] . . . obstacles” \nand take other “actions . . . necessary to install . . . barriers \n                                                                                                 \n11 They do not dispute that the Prototype Project is an “additional \nphysical barrier.” \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 21 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  21 \n \nand roads” extends beyond the erection of entirely new \nbarriers and encompasses the maintenance, enhancement, \nand replacement of existing barriers. \nCommon sense also supports our analysis.  To suggest \nthat Congress would authorize DHS to build new border \nbarriers but (impliedly) prohibit the maintenance, repair, and \nreplacement of existing ones makes no practical sense.  See \nGriffin  v.  Oceanic  Contractors,  Inc.,  458 U.S.  564,  575 \n(1982) (“[I]nterpretations of a statute which would produce \nabsurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations \nconsistent with the legislative purpose are available.”). \nB.  The projects are “in areas of high illegal entry \ninto the United States.” \nThe  San  Diego  and  Calexico  Waivers  cited  data \ndemonstrating that the border barrier projects are “in areas \nof  high  illegal  entry.”    IIRIRA  § 102(a);  82 Fed.  Reg. \n35,984, 42,830.  In the U.S. Border Patrol’s San Diego \nSector, the location of the Prototype and San Diego Projects, \nthe Border Patrol apprehended over 31,000 undocumented \nimmigrants  and  seized  approximately  9,167  pounds  of \nmarijuana and 1,317 pounds of cocaine in fiscal year 2016.  \n82 Fed. Reg. 35,984.  In the El Centro Sector, the location of \nthe Calexico Project, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended \nover  19,000  undocumented  immigrants  and  seized \napproximately 2,900 pounds of marijuana and 126 pounds \nof cocaine over the same period.  Id. at 42,830.  This is ample \nevidence of “high illegal entry” in these areas. \nCalifornia  and  the  environmental  groups  nonetheless \ncontend  the  San  Diego  and  Calexico  Projects  are  not \nauthorized by section 102(a) because they are not “in areas \nof high illegal entry into the United States.”  They do not \ndispute the evidence of “illegal entry” provided by DHS.  \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 22 of 30\n22  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nNor  do  they  dispute  that  the  number  of  undocumented \nimmigrants apprehended and the amount of illegal narcotics \nseized are objectively “high.”  Instead, they assert that the \nSan  Diego  and  El  Centro  statistics  are  not  comparably \n“high”  when  measured  against  other  sectors  on  the \nsouthwest border or the rates of illegal entry in these sectors \nin the past. \nHowever,  IIRIRA does not dictate that  “high  illegal \nentry” is a comparative determination.  Absent qualification, \n“high illegal entry” means what it says.  The fact that there \nare areas with “higher illegal entry” says nothing about \nwhether the San Diego and El Centro sectors are “areas of \nhigh illegal entry.”  Even assuming that “areas of high illegal \nentry” are identified relative to other border sectors, San \nDiego and El Centro are in the top 35% of border sectors \nwith respect to the number of undocumented immigrants \napprehended.  Finally, to the extent the challenge targets the \nSecretary’s discretion in selecting where to exercise her \nauthority under section 102(a), such an inquiry is foreclosed \nby  IIRIRA’s  bar  on  probing  the  merits  of  a  waiver \ndetermination, § 102(c)(2), and the APA’s bar on reviewing \ndiscretionary agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). \nC.  Section  102(b)  does  not  impose  limits  on \nSection 102(a)’s broad grant of authority. \nHaving  determined  that  section 102(a)’s  grant  of \nauthority encompasses the border barrier projects, we next \nconsider  whether  section 102(b)  imposes  limits  on  that \nbroad grant of authority.  Section 102(b) provides in relevant \npart: \n(1) Additional  fencing  along  southwest \nborder.— \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 23 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  23 \n \n(A) Reinforced fencing.—In carrying out \nsubsection  (a),  the  Secretary  of \nHomeland  Security  shall  construct \nreinforced  fencing  along  not  less  than \n700 miles of the southwest border where \nfencing  would  be  most  practical  and \neffective and provide for the installation \nof  additional  physical  barriers,  roads, \nlighting,  cameras,  and  sensors  to  gain \noperational  control  of  the  southwest \nborder. \n(B) Priority areas.—In carrying out this \nsection,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity shall— \n(i) identify the 370 miles, or other \nmileage determined by the Secretary, \nwhose authority to determine other \nmileage shall expire on December 31, \n2008,  along  the  southwest  border \nwhere  fencing  would  be  most \npractical  and  effective  in  deterring \nsmugglers  and  aliens  attempting  to \ngain  illegal  entry  into  the  United \nStates; and \n(ii) not later than December 31, 2008, \ncomplete construction of reinforced \nfencing  along  the  miles  identified \nunder clause (i). \nThe question is whether the fencing requirements and \ndeadlines  in  section 102(b)  establish  limits  applicable  to \nsection 102(a).  They do not.  Section 102(b)’s provisions for \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 24 of 30\n24  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \npriority  projects  do  not  swallow  section 102(a)’s \nindependent  authorization  to  build  “additional  physical \nbarriers.”  Congress’s alternative use of the phrases “[i]n \ncarrying out subsection (a)” and “this section” indicates that \nsection 102(b) applies to some but not all of the construction \nauthorized by section 102(a).  In other words, section 102(a) \nis most plausibly read as a broad grant of authority to build \nborder infrastructure, while section 102(b) merely denotes \ncertain priority projects Congress intended DHS to complete \nfirst.  Limits on the priority projects apply to those projects \nalone, not the wider universe of construction authorized by \nsection 102(a). \nThe “general/specific canon” of statutory construction \ndoes  not  require  a  different  interpretation.    That  canon \nprovides that when two conflicting provisions cannot be \nreconciled, the more specific provision should be treated as \nan exception to the general rule.  See Antonin Scalia & Bryan \nA. Gardner, Reading Law 183 (2012).  Herein lies the rub.  \nSections 102(a) and 102(b) do not conflict.  See Marx v. Gen. \nRevenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 386–87 (2013) (explaining \nthat,  because  the  case  did  not  fall  within  the  specific \nprovision, it was governed by the general provision and the \n“general/specific canon” was inapplicable). \nFinally, the narrow interpretation offered by California \nand  the  environmental  groups  renders  section  102(a) \nsuperfluous.  If section 102(b) defines the entire scope of \nDHS’s authority to build border infrastructure projects under \nsection 102,  section  102(a)  would  lack  any  independent \neffect.  “[W]e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a \ncongressional enactment which renders superfluous another \nportion of that same law.”  Mackey v. Lanier Collection \nAgency & Serv., Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 837 (1988). \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 25 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  25 \n \nIn short, the plain text of section 102(a) grants DHS \nauthority  to  construct  the  Prototype,  San  Diego,  and \nCalexico Projects, and that grant of authority is not limited \nby section 102(b).  The district court correctly granted DHS \nsummary judgment on the ultra vires claims. \nHaving determined that the border barrier projects were \nauthorized  under  section 102(a),  we  have  little  trouble \nconcluding that the environmental claims were also properly \ndismissed.  The Secretary has waived the legal requirements \nthat California and the environmental groups allege DHS \nviolated.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 35,985 (waiving application of \nNEPA, CZMA, and the APA to the San Diego and Prototype \nProjects); id. at 42,830 (waiving application of NEPA and \nthe APA to the Calexico Project).  And of course, we lack \njurisdiction  to  consider  any  argument  challenging  the \nwaivers themselves. \nFinally, California and the environmental groups argue \nthat because their environmental claims challenge DHS’s \nplans to replace fourteen miles of secondary fencing in San \nDiego, and DHS concedes that the San Diego Waiver did not \nextend  to  those  plans,  the  San  Diego  Waiver  does  not \nprovide a defense to the environmental claims as applied to \nthe secondary fencing.  We need not reach this challenge \nbecause, as of the time of this appeal, DHS’s plans to replace \nthe secondary fencing, including whether to comply with \nNEPA and CZMA, are not yet “final” agency actions for \npurposes of the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action \nmade  reviewable  by  statute  and  final  agency  action  for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court are \nsubject to judicial review.” (emphasis added)); Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (explaining that final \nagency  action  both  represents  the  consummation  of  the \nagency’s decision-making process and has legal effect). \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 26 of 30\n26  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe plain language of section 102 dictates the outcome \nof this appeal.  We have jurisdiction to consider California \nand the environmental groups’ ultra vires and environmental \nclaims to the extent those claims do not “aris[e] from” the \nSecretary’s  waiver  determinations  under  section 102(c).  \nThe  Prototype,  San  Diego,  and  Calexico  Projects  are \nauthorized under section 102(a)’s broad grant of authority, \nwhich is not limited by section 102(b).  The environmental \nclaims are precluded by the Secretary’s waiver of NEPA, \nCZMA, and the APA. \nAFFIRMED. \n \nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nIf we could reach the merits of these appeals, I would \nconcur in my colleagues’ opinion.

LITIG.  27 \n \nnecessary to ensure expeditious construction \nof the barriers and roads under this section. \nAny such decision by the Secretary shall be \neffective upon being published in the Federal \nRegister. \n(2) Federal court review.— \n(A) In general.—The district courts of the \nUnited  States  shall  have  exclusive \njurisdiction  to  hear  all  causes  or  claims \narising from any action undertaken, or any \ndecision made, by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity pursuant to paragraph (1).  A cause \nof  action  or  claim  may  only  be  brought \nalleging a violation of the Constitution of the \nUnited  States.    The  court  shall  not  have \njurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in \nthis subparagraph. \n(B) Time for filing of complaint. . . . \n(C) Ability to seek appellate review.—An \ninterlocutory or final judgment, decree, or \norder of the district court may be reviewed \nonly upon petition for a writ of certiorari to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. \nIIRIRA § 102(c). \nSection 102(c)(2)(A) first provides that district courts \n“shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims \narising from any action undertaken , or any decision made, \nby  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  pursuant  to \nparagraph (1),” and then states “[a] cause of action or claim \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 28 of 30\n28  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nmay only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution \nof the United States.”  My colleagues do not think that the \nsecond  clause  modifies  the  district  court’s  jurisdiction.  \nRather,  the  majority  holds  that  the  district  court  has \njurisdiction  to  consider  not  just  plaintiffs’  constitutional \nclaims, but also their ultra vires claims. \nI have questions as to the majority’s interpretation of the \nstatute, but recognize that the presumption that Congress \ndoes not intend to deny all judicial review arguably provides \na basis for the district court considering the plaintiffs’ ultra \nvires claims.  See Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190 (1958) \n(noting that courts “cannot lightly infer that Congress does \nnot intend judicial protection of rights it confers against \nagency action taken in excess of delegated powers.”). \nBut even accepting that the district court may consider \nsome  of  plaintiffs’  ultra  vires  claims,  we  do  not  have \njurisdiction to review its decision.  Section 102(c)(2)(C)’s \ndirection is clear and unequivocal: “An interlocutory or final \njudgment,  decree,  or  order  of  the  district  court  may  be \nreviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the \nSupreme  Court  of  the  United  States.”    It  covers  all \nconceivable decisions by a district court: orders, decrees, and \ninterlocutory and final judgments.  It states that review is \n“only  upon  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari.”    IIRIRA \n§ 102(c)(2)(C).  I read this subsection as requiring that for \nall actions filed in a district court that arise “from any action \nundertaken,  or  any  decision  made,  by  the  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1),” appellate \nreview is limited to the Supreme Court.  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  \nMoreover, as Congress has provided for appellate review, \nthere is no reason not to abide by the statute’s plain intent.  \nSee Flores-Miramontes v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th \nCir. 2000) (noting that if plaintiff “can raise his claims \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 29 of 30\n  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG.  29 \n \nelsewhere  . . .  we  need  not  read  an  exception  into  the \njurisdiction-stripping provision at issue.”). \nThe  majority  circumvents  the  statute’s  restriction  on \nappellate jurisdiction by arguing that the ultra vires claims \ndo  not  “arise  out  of”  the  Secretary’s  waiver  of  legal \nrequirements under § 102(c)(1).  This ignores the obvious \nthrust  of  the  plaintiffs’  complaints,  which  challenge  the \nSecretary’s authority to “waive all legal requirements” on \nboth  constitutional  and  statutory  grounds.  Indeed,  their \nclaims  under  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act, \n42  U.S.C. § 4321 et. seq., the Administrative Procedure Act, \n5 U.S.C. § 551 et. seq., and the Coastal Zone Management \nAct, 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et. seq.,  primarily assert that the \nSecretary cannot waive the procedural requirements of those \nstatutes. \nIt is true that plaintiffs’ assertions that the Secretary lacks \nany authority to construct border walls are arguably separate \nfrom plaintiffs’ arguments concerning the Secretary’s ability \nto waive legal requirements.  But these are weak secondary \narguments that the district court and the majority correctly \nreject.  These are arguments that would be raised at different \ntimes, possibly in different fora, but for the Secretary’s \nexercise  of  authority  under  § 102(c)(1).    Moreover,  the \ndistrict court’s rejection of collateral or secondary arguments \nin litigation that primarily challenge the Secretary’s exercise \nof  authority  under  § 102(c)(1)  remains  subject  to  the \nappellate restriction in § 102(c)(2)(C).  One of the purposes \nof the restriction on appellate jurisdiction is to expedite \nappellate review and this purpose is compromised if the \nlosing parties are allowed to seek review of some issues in \nthe court of appeal and others in the Supreme Court. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-1, Page 30 of 30\n30  IN RE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE ENVTL. LITIG. \n \nAccordingly,  I  dissent  from  the  majority’s  opinion \nbecause  § 102(c)(2)(C)  restricts  appellate  review  of  the \ndistrict court’s decisions in these cases to the Supreme Court. \n\n  Case: 18-55474, 02/11/2019, ID: 11184856, DktEntry: 35-2, Page 1 of 4\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nOffice of the Clerk \n95 Seventh Street \nSan Francisco, CA 94103 \nInformation Regarding Judgment and Post-Judgment Proceedings \nJudgment \n• This Court has filed and entered the attached judgment in your case.\nFed.

In addition to \n4  the Executive Branch’s inherent authority over immigration policy, foreign affairs, and \n5  national security, Congress has called on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n6  (“DHS”) to construct physical barriers and roads along the border to deter illegal \n7  crossings in areas of high illegal entry.  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n8  Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA” or “Act”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I  \n9  § 102, 110 Stat. 3009-554 (Sept. 30, 1996), as amended.  In order to speed construction \n10  of  these border  infrastructure  projects,  Congress  gave  the  DHS  Secretary  specific \n11  authority to waive any legal requirement necessary to ensure expeditious construction, \n12  and  strictly  limited  judicial  review  of  such  determinations—only  constitutional \n13  challenges are permitted and the only appellate review is a petition of certiorari to the \n14  Supreme Court.  The Act has been repeatedly upheld in the face of legal challenges. \n15  In this suit, Plaintiff challenges DHS’s recent exercise of this waiver authority \n16  for border infrastructure projects along a 15-mile stretch of the international border \n17  south of San Diego that the DHS Secretary determined remains an area of high illegal \n18  entry.  Plaintiff’s constitutional claims are meritless, largely retreading theories rejected \n19  by every court to consider the constitutionality of the statute.  And its non-constitutional \n20  challenges to the waiver determination are barred by the Act.  Its challenges under the \n21  environmental  statutes  have  been  mooted  by  the  waiver  determination,  and  its \n22  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claim must be dismissed because the Freedom \n23  of Information Act (“FOIA”) provides an adequate remedy.1  Accordingly, the Court \n24  should  dismiss Counts 1-6  in full and Count 7  in  part  for lack of subject  matter \n25  jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n26 \n                                           \n27  1  Defendants do not seek dismissal of Count 7 to the extent it asserts a claim under \nthe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552.  That claim is based on two FOIA requests submitted in \n28  May 2017, which are currently being processed by Defendants. \n  1 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.164   Page 14 of 56\n \n1  BACKGROUND \n2  I.  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n3  Among its responsibilities, DHS is responsible for border security and the \n4  detection and prevention of illegal entry into the United States.  See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. \n5  § 202(a)(1)-(2).  Congress has ordered DHS to achieve and maintain operational \n6  control of the international land border.  See Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law \n7  109-367, § 2(a), 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. § 1701 note).  “Operational \n8  control” means “prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including \n9  entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and \n10  other contraband.”  Id. § 2(b).  Consistent with that mandate, the President has \n11  directed DHS to take immediate steps to prevent all unlawful entries into the United \n12  States, including the immediate construction of physical infrastructure to prevent \n13  illegal entry.  See Exec. Order 13767 §§ 2(a), 4(a), 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 25, 2017). \n14  Among the statutory authorities provided to DHS to carry out its border security \n15  mission is the IIRIRA.  See Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102, 110 Stat. 3009-\n16  554 (Sept. 30, 1996).  Codified at 8 U.S.C § 1103 note (and included as an appendix \n17  at the end of this memorandum), IIRIRA § 102 has been amended several times.  See \n18  Dep’t of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, \n19  Title V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007); Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. \n20  109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006); REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n21  13, Div. B, Title I §102, 119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (May 11, 2005).  The IIRIRA directs \n22  the Secretary of Homeland Security to “take such actions as may be necessary to \n23  install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to \n24  detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal \n25  crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”  Pub. L. No. 104-208, \n26  Div. C., Title I § 102(a), as amended.2   \n27 \n                                           \n2 In 1996, responsibility for border enforcement lay with the Attorney General.  The \n28 \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, created DHS and transferred \n  2 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.165   Page 15 of 56\n \n1  In § 102(b), Congress provided certain requirements for implementing the \n2  broad mandate laid out in § 102(a).  These requirements have varied over the years.  \n3  For example, in 1996, Congress specified that, in “carrying out subsection (a), the \n4  [agency] shall provide for the construction . . . of second and third fences, in addition \n5  to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads between the fences” in a 14-mile section \n6  near San Diego.  Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C., Title I § 102(b)(1).  In 2006, Congress \n7  struck the reference to San Diego and required construction of “at least 2 layers of \n8  reinforced fencing, [and] the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lights, \n9  cameras, and sensors” in five specified locations along the southern border, with \n10  deadlines for certain of the projects.  Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3.  In the most recent \n11  amendment, Congress removed the specifications set out in 2006 and instead required \n12  “construct[ion of] reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest \n13  border” but gave the Secretary discretion to determine “where fencing would be most \n14  practical and effective” with the goal “to gain operational control of the southwest \n15  border.”  Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V § 564; see also IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(D) \n16  (as amended) (stating that the Secretary is free to determine that the use or placement \n17  of “fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular \n18  location” is not “the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational \n19  control over the international border” at that location).   \n20  Section 102(c) seeks to ensure expeditious construction pursuant to the mandate \n21  laid out in § 102(a) in two ways.  First, it permits waiver of legal impediments:  \n22  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such \n23 \nSecretary, in such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to \n24  ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \nsection.   Any such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon \n25 \nbeing published in the Federal Register. \n26 \n27                                             \nborder enforcement authority to it.  In 2005, IIRIRA § 102 was amended to refer to \n28  the DHS Secretary.  See H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.). \n  3 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.166   Page 16 of 56\n \n1  Id. § 102(c)(1).  This provision had originally been limited to the Endangered Species \n2  Act (“ESA”) and the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), see Pub. L. No. \n3  104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(c), but the REAL ID Act expanded it to its current \n4  breadth.  See H.R. Rep. 109-72, at 171-72 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (attached as Ex. \n5  2) (explaining “Congress’ intent that the Secretary’s discretionary waiver authority \n6  extends to any local, state or federal statute, regulation, or administrative order that \n7  could impede expeditious construction of border security infrastructure”); see also \n8  H.R. Rep. 104-828, at 200 (Sept. 24, 1996) (Conf. Rep.) (attached as Ex. 1) \n9  (explaining that the original waiver of two environmental laws was intended “to \n10  facilitate a uniform construction of necessary fences and roads”). \n11    Second, § 102(c) provides for limited and streamlined judicial review of the \n12  Secretary’s exercise of this waiver authority.  Federal district courts have “exclusive \n13  jurisdiction” to hear such claims, and the only “cause of action or claim” that may be \n14  brought is one “alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States” that is \n15  filed within sixty days of the Secretary’s action.  Id. § 102(c)(2)(A)-(B).  The only \n16  appellate review is a certiorari petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Id. § 102(c)(2)(C).  \n17  This provision was adopted by the conference committee for the appropriations bill of \n18  which the REAL ID Act was a part.  The House bill would have entirely barred \n19  judicial review, see 109th Cong., H.R. 1268, Div. B § 102 (engrossed in House, Mar. \n20  16, 2005) (attached as Ex. 3), but some had expressed concern about the \n21  constitutionality of such a total bar on review.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H553, 556-\n22  57 (Feb. 10, 2005) (attached as Ex. 7) (Statement of Cong. Farr) (introducing \n23  Congressional Research Service letter observing that Congress does not clearly have \n24  “authority to prevent courts . . . from addressing and remedying issues arising under \n25  the United States Constitution”).  Ultimately, the conference report explained that \n26  Congress was providing “federal judicial review for claims alleging that the actions or \n27  decisions of the Secretary violate the United States Constitution,” and that the strict \n28 \n  4 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.167   Page 17 of 56\n \n1  limits on judicial review reflected the “Conferees’ intent [] to ensure that judicial \n2  review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction \n3  of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary’s \n4  waiver.”  H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 172. \n5  II.  THE SECRETARY’S EXERCISE OF WAIVER AUTHORITY \n6  Pursuant to the IIRIRA, the Secretary has repeatedly issued waiver \n7  determinations as necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads \n8  along the border.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 19078 (Apr. 8, 2008); 73 Fed. Reg. 19077 (Apr. 8, \n9  2008); 72 Fed. Reg. 60870 (Oct. 26, 2007); 72 Fed. Reg. 2535 (Jan. 19, 2007); 70 \n10  Fed. Reg. 55622 (Sept. 22, 2005).  Every judicial challenge to these determinations \n11  has been dismissed.  See County of El Paso v. Chertoff, No. 08-196, 2008 WL \n12  4372693 (W.D. Tex. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 915 (2009); Save Our Heritage v. \n13  Gonzalez, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 (D.D.C. 2008); Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. \n14  Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2007), cert. denied, 554 U.S. 918 (2008); Sierra Club v. \n15  Ashcroft, No. 04-272, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005).  \n16  On July 26, 2017, the Secretary issued another waiver determination under the \n17  IIRIRA.  The Secretary determined that a fifteen-mile stretch of border in the U.S. \n18  Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector (the “Project Area”) is an area of high illegal entry.  \n19  82 Fed. Reg. 35984, 35984-85 (Aug. 2, 2017).  The Secretary also determined that \n20  there is “a need to construct physical barriers and roads . . . in the vicinity of the \n21  border of the United States to deter illegal crossings in this Project Area.  Id. at 35985.  \n22  Finally, the Secretary concluded that exercise of his waiver authority under the \n23  IIRIRA was necessary “to ensure the expeditious construction of the barriers and \n24  roads in the Project Area.”  Id.  Accordingly, the Secretary announced the waiver of \n25  certain laws “with respect to the construction of roads and physical barriers . . . in the \n26  Project Area.”  Id.  As relevant here, the waived laws include the NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \n27 \n28 \n  5 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.168   Page 18 of 56\n \n1  4321 et seq., and the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.3 \n2  Two specific projects that will be conducted pursuant to the waiver \n3  determination are currently in the contracting process.  One project involves \n4  replacement of the existing primary fencing in the Project Area, which was primarily \n5  constructed in the early 1990s using a design that is “no longer optimal for Border \n6  Patrol operations.”  Id. at 35984-85.  Contracts have not yet been solicited or awarded \n7  for this project, and construction is not expected to begin until early 2018.  The second \n8  project involves construction of border wall prototypes at the eastern end of the \n9  secondary barrier in the Project Area.  Id. at 35985.  The border wall prototypes are \n10  intended both to deter illegal entry at that location and to assist DHS in evaluating \n11  various design features for inclusion in a border wall standard to be used in future \n12  construction.  Id.  Contract solicitations for both reinforced solid concrete (“concrete”) \n13  and alternatives to reinforced solid concrete (“other materials”) prototypes were issued \n14  in March 2017, and amended several times before contract award.  See Solicitation \n15  Nos. HSBP1017R0022, HSBP1017R0023 (as amended Apr. 1, 2017) (attached as \n16  Exs. 12-13.  Contracts were awarded for concrete prototypes on August 30, 2017 and \n17  for other materials prototypes on September 7, 2017.  See Press Release (Sept. 7, \n18  2017) (link); Press Release (Aug. 30, 2017) (link) (attached as Exs. 16-17).  Prototype \n19  construction began on September 26, 2017 and is expected to be completed within 30 \n20  days.  See Press Release (Sept. 26, 2017) (link) (attached as Ex. 15). \n21  Even where the Secretary has waived environmental and other laws, U.S. \n22  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) still consults with relevant stakeholders \n23  pursuant to § 102(b)(1)(C).  And CBP explained at a congressional hearing, it does \n24  not “turn[] its back on environmental stewardship or continued consultation with \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n3 On September 12, 2017, DHS published a separate waiver determination for \n27  replacement of three miles of primary border fencing near Calexico, California in the \nEl Centro Sector.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 42829 (Sept. 12, 2017) (“El Centro Waiver”).  \n28  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint does not challenge this decision. \n  6 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.169   Page 19 of 56\n \n1  stakeholders.”  Walls & Waivers: Expedited Construction of the Southern Border Wall \n2  and Collateral Impacts to Communities and the Environment:  Joint Oversight Field \n3  Hearing Before Subcommittees to H.

For the \n11  prototypes project currently under construction, CBP has consulted with relevant \n12  stakeholders, conducted site surveys for environmental and endangered species \n13  concerns, and required the contractors to comply with best practices designed to \n14  mitigate any environmental harm.  See Memorandum, Construction and Evaluation of \n15  Border Wall Prototypes, U.S. Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, California (Sept. 25, \n16  2017) (attached as Ex. 14).  \n17  III.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n18  Plaintiff initially filed this action to challenge Defendants’ response to several \n19  requests under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552.  (ECF No. 1).  It later amended the \n20  complaint to allege violation of NEPA.  (ECF No. 6).  Pursuant the schedule set at the \n21  joint request of the parties, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on September \n22  6, 2017.  (ECF Nos. 14, 16).  Plaintiff’s second amended complaint alleges that the \n23  waiver determination is ultra vires (Count 1), that the waiver determination violates \n24  the Take Care Clause, Non-Delegation Doctrine, and Presentment Clause of the \n25  Constitution (Counts 2, 3, 4), that Defendants have failed to comply with NEPA and \n26  the ESA (Counts 5, 6), and that the processing of certain FOIA requests violates the \n27  FOIA and APA (Count 7).

United States, No. 3:17-cv-1911-TJW-BLM \n4  (Sept. 20, 2017) (brought by California and the California Coastal Commission); \n5  Defenders of Wildlife v. Duke, No. 3:17-cv-1873-GPC-WVG (Sept. 14, 2017) \n6  (brought by Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, and Animal Legal Defense Fund). \n7  ARGUMENT \n8  I.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n9  “[W]hen a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss \n10  the complaint, sua sponte if necessary.”  Pistor v. Garcia, 791 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th \n11  Cir. 2015).  Subject matter jurisdiction “refers to the courts’ statutory or constitutional \n12  power to adjudicate the case.”  Id.  Plaintiffs have the burden to establish jurisdiction.  \n13  See Washam v. Rabine, No. 3:13-2433, 2013 WL 1849233, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 1, \n14  2013).  In resolving a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), \n15  the Court “may consider evidence outside the complaint and ordinarily need not \n16  presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations.”  Osgood v. Main Street \n17  Marketing, LLC, No. 16-2415, 2017 WL 131829, at *4 (quotation marks omitted).4 \n18  A claim may be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for either the “lack of \n19  a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable \n20  legal theory.”  Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, 534 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th \n21  Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \n22  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is \n23  plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “Review is limited \n24  to the complaint, materials incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters \n25  of which the court may take judicial notice.”  Metlzer Inv.

PLAINTIFF’S NON-CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS REGARDING THE \nWAIVER DECISION MUST BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF \n3  JURISDICTION (COUNT 1) \n4 \nA.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Consider Plaintiff’s Non-\nConstitutional Claims Regarding the Waiver Decision \n5 \nIt is axiomatic that federal courts “are courts of limited jurisdiction possessing \n6 \nonly that power authorized by Constitution and statute.”  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. \n7 \n251, 256 (2013).  Accordingly, “district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a \n8 \nstatutory basis.”  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 552 \n9 \n(2005); see also Duldulao v. INS, 90 F.3d 396, 400 (9th Cir. 1996) (“Congress has the \n10 \nconstitutional authority to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.”).  \n11 \nBecause district court jurisdiction is a creature of statute, the extent of that jurisdiction \n12 \ndepends on congressional intent.  “Subject to constitutional constraints, Congress can, \n13 \nof course, make exceptions to the historic practice whereby courts review agency \n14 \naction.”  Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670, 672-73 \n15 \n(1986).  Thus a court must find that it lacks jurisdiction to review agency action upon \n16 \na showing of “specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable \n17 \nindicator of congressional intent, or a specific congressional intent to preclude judicial \n18 \nreview that is fairly discernible in the detail of the legislative scheme.”  Id. at 673.  It \n19 \nis Plaintiff’s burden, as the party asserting jurisdiction, to overcome the \n20 \n21 \n                                           \n22 \n5 Judicial notice is appropriate for many government documents.  See Papai v. Harbor \nTug and Barge Co., 67 F.3d 203, 207 n.5 (9th Cir. 1995), rev’d on other grounds, 520 \n23 \nU.S. 548 (1996) (“Judicial notice is properly taken of orders and decisions made by \n24  other courts or administrative agencies.”); Parks v.

Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)).   \n4  Here, Congress has expressly withdrawn district court jurisdiction to review \n5  non-constitutional challenges to the Secretary’s exercise of waiver authority:   \n6  The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction \nto hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any \n7 \ndecision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n8  paragraph (1).  A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a \nviolation of the Constitution of the United States.  The court shall not \n9 \nhave jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.   \n10 \nIIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A).  This specific statutory language expansively encompasses \n11 \n“all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made” \n12 \npursuant to § 102(c)(1).  Id.  The Act both expressly identifies the sort of suits that \n13 \nmay be brought:  “only . . . alleging a violation of the Constitution,” and expressly \n14 \nremoves court jurisdiction over “any claim not specified in this subparagraph.”  Id.   \n15 \nThere is no reason to doubt the import of this plain language.  A court in this \n16 \ndistrict found the Act straightforward, declaring that the provision “itself restricted \n17 \njudicial review of any claims to constitutional claims.”  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. \n18 \nDist. LEXIS 44244, at *28; see also id. (holding that Congress “circumscribed the \n19 \njudicial review available for decisions of the Secretary in the exercise of delegated \n20 \nauthority to expedite construction”); id. at *38 (“The only justiciable controversies \n21 \nCongress left for the courts to decide in this connection are constitutional claims.”).  \n22 \nThe Ninth Circuit has observed that “many . . . provisions of the IIRIRA . . . do in fact \n23 \nspecify that particular decisions are within the sole or unreviewable discretion of the \n24 \nAttorney General.”  Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 690 (9th \n25 \nCir. 2003).  Section 102(c) is strikingly similar to another provision of the IIRIRA, 8 \n26 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), which states:   \n27 \nThe Attorney General has sole discretion to waive [§ 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)] in \n28  the case of an immigrant who [meets certain conditions], if it is \n  10 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.173   Page 23 of 56\n \n1  established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that [certain \nconditions are met]. No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision \n2 \nor action by the Attorney General regarding a waiver under this clause. \n3 \nCourts have dismissed challenges to exercise of such waiver authority because the \n4 \nprovision “specifically precludes judicial review and vests DHS with sole authority to \n5 \nwaive inadmissibility bars.”  De Carreon v. Mukasey, No. 08-0501, 2008 WL \n6 \n11336922, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2008); Lugo-Miramontes v. Holder, 464 F. App’x \n7 \n639 (9th Cir. 2011) (“We lack jurisdiction to review the agency’s decision [under 8 \n8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)] . . . .”); Herrera-Castillo v. Holder, 573 F.3d 1004, 1010 \n9 \n(10th Cir. 2009) (holding that the court “lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA’s \n10 \ndecision [under § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)]”).   \n11 \nThere are many other examples of Congress using similarly unambiguous “shall \n12 \nnot have jurisdiction” formulations to partially or completely bar judicial review.  See, \n13 \ne.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1359 (“A district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in \n14 \nwhich any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made \n15 \nor joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.”); Upper Deck Int’l B.V. v. Upper \n16 \nDeck Co., No. 11-1741, 2012 WL 1713453, at *7 (S.D. Cal. May 15, 2012) \n17 \n(acknowledging that § 1359 “denies a district court jurisdiction” under the specified \n18 \ncircumstances).6  Further, the Act’s jurisdictional bar of “any claim not specified in \n19 \nthis subparagraph” cannot be confused with narrower statutory limitations which \n20 \nmerely specify the scope of jurisdiction pursuant to a particular statute.  Cf. 28 U.S.C. \n21 \n§ 1346(d) (“The district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of any \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n6  See also, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(b)(1) (providing for “mandatory detention of \n24  suspected terrorist” but strictly limiting judicial review: “Judicial review of any action \nor decision relating to this section . . . is available exclusively in habeas corpus \n25 \nproceedings consistent with this subsection. Except as provided in the preceding \nsentence, no court shall have jurisdiction to review, by habeas corpus petition or \n26 \notherwise, any such action or decision.”); 22 U.S.C. § 6450 (“No court shall have \n27  jurisdiction to review any Presidential determination or agency action under this \nchapter or any amendment made by this chapter.” (adopted by the Int’l Religious \n28  Freedom Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-292, § 410, 112 Stat. 2787 (Oct. 27, 1998))). \n  11 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.174   Page 24 of 56\n \n1  civil action or claim for a pension.” (emphasis added)).  In sum, Congress could not \n2  have been clearer in stating that all non-constitutional claims are barred.  Accordingly, \n3  Plaintiff’s attempt to challenge the Secretary’s action on non-constitutional grounds \n4  must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Kerr v. Jewell, 836 F.3d 1048, \n5  1058 & n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) (upholding dismissal for lack of jurisdiction “because it is \n6  fairly discernible that Congress intended the statute’s review scheme to provide the \n7  exclusive avenue to judicial review”).  \n8  Plaintiff cannot evade this clear jurisdictional limitation by citing the series of \n9  cases applying Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184 (1958).  Kyne involved a National \n10  Labor Relations Board determination that was in “direct conflict with a provision of \n11  the National Labor Relations Act.”  Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp \n12  Fin. Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 42 (1991).  The Kyne Court rejected the argument that it lacked \n13  jurisdiction where the statutory review provision did not expressly authorize judicial \n14  review of such determinations.  See id. at 42-43.  Kyne stands for the proposition that \n15  courts “cannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial protection of rights \n16  it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated powers.”  MCorp Fin., \n17  502 U.S. at 43 (quoting Kyne, 358 U.S. at 190); see also id. at 44 (“Kyne stands for \n18  the familiar proposition that ‘only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of \n19  a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.’” \n20  (quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967))).  But Kyne does not \n21  “authoriz[e] judicial review of any agency action that is alleged to have exceeded the \n22  agency's statutory authority.”  MCorp Fin., 502 U.S. at 43 (emphasis added).  Instead, \n23  Kyne and its progeny address only whether ultra vires review is impliedly barred by \n24  the statutory scheme.  Kyne does not apply where “Congress has spoken clearly and \n25  directly” to preclude review.  Id. at 44; see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United States, \n26  648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (stating that presumption of judicial review for \n27  administrative action “is overcome” when “Congress expressly bars review by \n28 \n  12 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.175   Page 25 of 56\n \n1  statute”); Nyunt v. Broad. Bd. of Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n2  (holding that the Kyne exception “applies . . . only where . . . the statutory preclusion \n3  of review is implied rather than express”). \n4  Here, just as in MCorp Financial, Congress “has spoken clearly and directly” to \n5  preclude judicial review.  In MCorp Financial, the relevant statute stated that “except \n6  as otherwise provided in this section or under [two other sections] of this title no court \n7  shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement \n8  of any [Board] notice or order under this section.”  12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1); see 502 \n9  U.S. at 44.  The Supreme Court held that ultra vires review under Kyne was \n10  unavailable because “the clarity of the congressional preclusion of review” in this \n11  statute stood in marked contrast to the statute at issue in Kyne, in which it had only \n12  been argued that a judicial review statute “implied, by its silence, a preclusion of \n13  review of the contested determination.”  502 U.S. at 44; see also United States v. \n14  Spiegel, 995 F.2d 138, 140 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting that the “statutory language [of \n15  § 1818(i)(1)] leaves no room to doubt that Congress provided only one avenue for \n16  challenging” agency action under that section).  The IIRIRA, like 12 U.S.C. \n17  § 1919(i)(1), does not raise the issue of an implied preclusion of review.  Congress has \n18  expressly barred judicial review of non-constitutional claims—“The court shall not \n19  have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.”  IIRIRA \n20  § 102(c)(2)(A).  The only avenue for challenging agency action here is a constitutional \n21  claim.  As another court has noted, the presumption in favor of judicial review cannot \n22  be employed “where, as here, Congress has been so explicit in stating a prohibition \n23  against judicial review—federal courts are not, after all, superlegislatures entitled to \n24  invoke a generalized presumption to trump an express ‘hands off’ direction from \n25  Congress.”  Am. Soc’y of Anesthesiologists v. Shalala, 90 F. Supp. 2d 973, 975 (N.D. \n26  Ill. 2000), aff’d, 279 F.3d 447 (7th Cir. 2002) (addressing 42 U.S.C. § 1395w–4).  \n27  The plain meaning of the Act should be the end of the matter.

Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 704 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[Courts] must presume that a \n2  legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. \n3  When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: \n4  judicial inquiry is complete.” (quoting Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. \n5  249, 253-254 (1992))); Santiago Salgado v. Garcia, 384 F.3d 769, 771 (9th Cir. 2004) \n6  (“In construing federal statutes, we presume that the ordinary meaning of the words \n7  chosen by Congress accurately express its legislative intent.”).  But if the Court finds \n8  any ambiguity in the text, the legislative history also supports the government’s \n9  reading.  The limitation on judicial review was adopted as part of the REAL ID Act of \n10  2005.  The underlying bill that passed the House of Representatives would have gone \n11  even farther, entirely barring judicial review, see 109th Cong., H.R. 1268, Div. B \n12  § 102 (engrossed in House, Mar. 16, 2005) (attached as Ex. 3),7 which was a \n13  significant concern to opponents of the bill.8  Because the Senate passed a substitute \n14  version of the bill that differed substantially from the House version (and did not \n15  include any provision regarding IIRIRA § 102), the bill was finalized by a conference \n16  committee.  See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.).  The conference \n17  committee noted that the House bill “would prohibit judicial review” and explained \n18  that the committee had “revised the House provision in the following respects,” \n19  including “provid[ing] federal judicial review for claims alleging that the actions or \n20 \n                                           \n7 “[N]o court, administrative agency, or other entity shall have jurisdiction—(A) to \n21 \nhear any cause or claim arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by \n22  the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1); or (B) to order \ncompensatory, declaratory, injunctive, equitable, or any other relief for damage \n23 \nalleged to arise from any such action or decision.” \n24  8  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) (statement of Congresswoman \nDavis) (objecting to provision because it “bars judicial review of any claim arising \n25 \nfrom the construction of barriers and roads at borders”); 151 Cong. Rec. H559 (Feb. \n10, 2005) (statement of Congressman Mark Udall) (“The bill also removes any \n26 \njudicial review of the waiving of these laws.”); id. at E247 (attached as Ex. 8) \n27  (statement of Congressman James Langevin) (“This overly broad provision would \ngive unprecedented power to the Secretary to undertake large construction projects \n28  without any accountability or judicial review.”). \n  14 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.177   Page 27 of 56\n \n1  decisions of the Secretary violate the United States Constitution.”  See H.R. Rep. No. \n2  109-72 at 171-72.  The report further explained that “[t]he Conferees’ intent is to \n3  ensure that judicial review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the \n4  expeditious construction of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the \n5  purpose of the Secretary’s waiver.”  Id. at 172.  Thus, the conference report makes \n6  clear that the House’s complete bar on judicial review was modified only to permit \n7  judicial review of constitutional claims, and that strictly limited judicial review was \n8  fundamental to the statutory scheme.  Cf. NLRB v. United Food & Commercial \n9  Workers Union, 484 U.S. 112, 130-133 (1988) (holding that “prosecutorial” decisions \n10  of the General Counsel of the NLRB are not subject to judicial review, in part because \n11  review “would involve lengthy judicial proceedings in precisely the area where \n12  Congress was convinced that speed of resolution is most necessary”).9 \n13  In sum, “the clear terms of the statute” control here, and no “policy arguments” \n14  Plaintiff may wish to make can “override Congress’s clear choice.”  Spiegel, 995 F.2d \n15  at 140.  Plaintiff’s non-constitutional challenges to the waiver determination must be \n16  dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \n17  B.  To the Extent the Court Conducts Ultra Vires Review, It Must \nConclude that the Secretary Did Not Exceed His Statutory Authority \n18 \nIn the alternative, to the extent the Court determines that—despite the plain text \n19 \n20                                             \n9  Indeed, environmental groups and the prior challenges to the exercise of § 102(c) \n21  waiver authority have accepted as a given that the only available legal challenges are \nconstitutional claims.  See, e.g., County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693 (pressing only \n22 \nnondelegation, Presentment Clause, and Tenth Amendment constitutional claims); \nSave Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 (pressing only a nondelegation constitutional \n23 \nclaim); Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119 (pressing only nondelegation, \n24  Presentment Clause, and separation of powers constitutional claims); Sierra Club, \n2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244 (pressing only nondelegation and Article III \n25 \nconstitutional claims, along with a retroactivity claim with constitutional \nimplications); see also Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 122  (statement of \n26 \nSandra Purohit, Defenders of Wildlife) (observing that the withdrawal of “judicial \n27  review with the exception of Constitutional challenges, thus preclud[es] any \nindependent review of whether the DHS Secretary has only waived the laws \n28  ‘necessary’ for the expeditious construction of border walls”). \n  15 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.178   Page 28 of 56\n \n1  of the statute and Congress’ clear intent—courts retain jurisdiction to determine \n2  whether a waiver determination is ultra vires, the Secretary’s decision here must be \n3  upheld.  Under the extraordinarily deferential ultra vires review standard, the Court \n4  must conclude that the Secretary did not exceed his statutory authority. \n5  Under the “narrow exception” carved out in Leedom v. Kyne, where a court \n6  otherwise lacks authority to review an agency action, it may determine that the agency \n7  has exceeded its statutory authority only if the challenged action “contravene[s] ‘clear \n8  and mandatory’ statutory language.”  Pacific Maritime Ass’n v. NLRB, 827 F.3d 1203, \n9  1208 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188).10  The agency must be “charged \n10  with violating a clear statutory mandate or prohibition.”  Staacke v.

None of its arguments establishes that \n7  DHS violated a “clear statutory mandate or prohibition.”  Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281.  \n8  1.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(c)’s waiver authority excludes \nactions and decisions under § 102(a)’s general mandate  \n9 \nPlaintiff primarily argues that § 102(c) waiver authority “is limited to the \n10 \nspecific border barriers and roads required to be constructed pursuant to IIRIRA \n11 \nsection 102(b).”  2d Am.

This theory finds no support in the Act’s text: \n12 \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland \n13 \nSecurity shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such \n14  Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, determines necessary to \nensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \n15 \nsection. \n16 \nIIRIRA § 102(c)(1), as amended.  By its plain terms, the waiver authority extends to \n17 \nany construction “under this section,” upon determinations made in the Secretary’s \n18 \n“sole discretion.” Id.  “[T]his section” unambiguously refers to IIRIRA § 102 as a \n19 \nwhole.  See, e.g., House Office of the Legislative Counsel, Guide to Legislative \n20 \nDrafting, Section III. Organization within a bill (link) (explaining that “sections” are \n21 \nthe numbered “basic unit[s] of a bill, and thus of an enacted statute” and that \n22 \n“terminology for referring to units within a section has become highly standardized”).  \n23 \nWhen Congress wanted to identify a specific unit within § 102, it did so in the \n24 \nstandardized format.11  Accordingly, the reference to “this section” in § 102(c)(1) \n25 \n                                           \n26  11 As the Guide to Legislative Drafting explains, § 102(a) is a “subsection,” § \n102(b)(1) is a “paragraph,” and § 102(b)(1)(A) is a “subparagraph.”  See id.

Plaintiff concedes that this provision “provid[es] general authority \n11  to construct border fences and other border barriers.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 61; see also \n12  id. ¶¶ 62, 66, 87, 124 (acknowledging this “general authority”).  But Plaintiff appears \n13  to argue that § 102(b)(1), by identifying specific requirements for the agency “[i]n \n14  carrying out subsection (a),” limits the general authority set out in § 102(a).  See id. ¶ \n15  124 (claiming that § 102(b) “identifies the specific ‘construction of fencing and road \n16  improvements along the border’ necessary to ‘carry[] out subsection(a)’”).  This \n17  theory is highly implausible and must be rejected for four reasons. \n18  First, when Congress identifies certain specific applications of a general grant \n19  of authority, those specific requirements cannot generally be understood to prohibit all \n20  other applications of the general authority.  See Barnhart v.

As for the IIRIRA, a court specifically rejected the notion that \n14  “the 2006 amendment to section 102(b) . . . narrow[ed] the Secretary’s authority \n15  [under § 102(a)],” because “[t]he statute’s explicit language does not support such an \n16  interpretation.”  Save our Heritage Org., 533 F.

See, e.g., CBP Finding of No Significant Impact for \n28 \nInfrastructure (Nov. 19, 2003) (attached as Ex. 19) (explaining that “the proposed \n  19 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.182   Page 32 of 56\n \n1  Second, the specific terms of the IIRIRA as originally enacted cut sharply \n2  against such a reading.  It is not apparent how the broad mandate to “install additional \n3  physical barriers and roads . . . to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry,” \n4  § 102(a), could be fulfilled by the narrow instruction to construct “second and third \n5  fences” “along the 14 miles of the international land border . . . starting at the Pacific \n6  Ocean.”  Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(b)(1).  Plaintiff’s effort to force \n7  such a reading would render § 102(a) largely superfluous.  See Hooks v. Ktsap Tenant \n8  Support Servs., Inc., 816 F.3d 550, 560 (9th Cir. 2016) (“It is a cardinal principle of \n9  statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it \n10  can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or \n11  insignificant.”).  Section 102(a)’s broad mandate to identify “areas of high illegal \n12  entry” would not only become empty, but also create substantial confusion if \n13  Congress only intended to address a single 14-mile stretch near San Diego.  See \n14  Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Am. Guaranty Life Ins. Co., 722 F.2d 1498, 1500 (9th Cir. \n15  1984), overruled on other grounds by In re McLinn, 739 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1984) \n16  (“Interpretative constructions of a statute which would render some words surplusage, \n17  defy common sense, or lead to mischief or absurdity are to be avoided.”); see also \n18  Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v.

These requirements \n2  do not foreclose many other applications of § 102(a).15  \n3  Finally, Plaintiff cannot overcome the plain meaning of the statutory text by \n4  pointing out that Congress, in passing § 102 in 1996 and amending § 102(c) in 2005, \n5  was primarily focused on portions of fencing near San Diego.  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n6  73-75. 16  See Aragon-Salazar, 769 F.3d at 704 (“When the words of a statute are \n7  unambiguous . . . judicial inquiry is complete.”).  Congress could easily have crafted \n8  language that simply mandated the relevant construction near San Diego.  Instead, \n9  Congress adopted a far broader approach by establishing a general mandate in \n10  § 102(a) that is not geographically limited and by extending § 102(c)’s waiver \n11  authority to any actions or decisions “under this section.”  The conference report—\n12  generally considered the best evidence of legislative intent, see Nw. Forest Resource \n13  Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 825, 835 (9th Cir. 1996)—confirms that § 102 applied \n14  beyond San Diego by explaining that it “provides for construction and strengthening \n15  of barriers along U.S. land borders.”  H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, 2005); see also \n16  id. at 171 (describing both the original and amended waiver authority as “ensur[ing] \n17  expeditious construction of barriers and roads” and “the expeditious construction of \n18  security infrastructure along the border”).  The breadth of § 102(c) was repeatedly \n19  noted by opponents of the bill and was not contradicted by its sponsors.  See, e.g., 151 \n20  Cong. Rec. H459 (Feb. 9, 2005) (attached as Ex. 6) (statement of Cong. Jackson-Lee) \n21 \n                                           \n22  15  Plaintiff’s claim that the § 102(b)(1) requirements stemming from the 2006 and \n2007 amendments “have already been fulfilled,”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 132; id. ¶¶ 88-91, \n23 \n130-132, is irrelevant because DHS does not ground its waiver determination in § \n102(b).  Defendants do not concede that these requirements have no current \n24 \nsignificance, but do not address the matter further here because nothing turns on it. \n25  16 Plaintiff’s citation of the title of House bill H.R. 1268 is entitled to no weight \nbecause the language Plaintiff emphasizes does not appear in the final legislation, and \n26 \ntherefore does not represent the intent of Congress as a whole.  See Pub. L. No. 109-\n27  13, Div. B.  See also Northstar Financial Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Investments, 615 \nF.3d 1106, 1120 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he Supreme Court has cautioned that the title of \n28  a statute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.”). \n  21 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.184   Page 34 of 56\n \n1  (“[The waiver provision] so broad that it would not just apply to the San Diego border \n2  fence that is the underlying reason for this provision. It would apply any other barrier \n3  or fence that may come about in the future.”).17  Thus, there is no reason to conclude \n4  that the triggering events for passage of the waiver—litigation delaying San Diego \n5  border infrastructure construction—should be interpreted to limit the otherwise plain \n6  text of the Act.  See Student Loan Fund of Idaho, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 272 F.3d \n7  1155, 1165 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[L]egislative history which does not demonstrate a clear \n8  and certain congressional intent cannot form the basis for enjoining regulations.”) \n9  2.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(a) and (c) unambiguously \napply only to the “initial construction of border barriers,” not \n10  their enhancement \n11 \nPlaintiff also argues that the § 102(c) waiver authority applies only “to the \n12 \ninitial construction of border barriers,” not the “border wall replacement or border \n13 \nwall prototype projects” at issue here.  2d Am.

Plaintiff’s cramped \n14 \nreading of the Act is not the best reading, let alone the exclusive reading—as would be \n15 \nnecessary to meet the ultra vires review standard here. \n16 \nWhile Plaintiff argues that the “plain language” of § 102(c) limits its scope to \n17 \n“initial construction,” 2d Am.

Indeed, members of Congress \n26 \nsimilarly noted that the 1996 version of § 102(c) also extended beyond San Diego.  \n27  See 142 Cong. Rec. H11076 (Sept. 25, 1996) (attached as Ex. 4) (statement of Rep. \nSaxton) (“[T]he way this section is written, the exemption applies to the entire border \n28  of the United States, not just the California-Mexico border near San Diego.”).  \n  22 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.185   Page 35 of 56\n \n1  qualifies the “barriers and roads” that fall within its scope.  See IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) \n2  (permitting waiver of legal requirements the Secretary “determines necessary to \n3  ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section”).  Both \n4  the wall replacement project and the prototypes project essentially concern \n5  “construction of . . . barriers.”  See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989 \n6  (defining construction as “[t]he action of framing, devising, or forming, by the putting \n7  together of parts; erection, building.”); Columbia Riverkeeper, 761 F.3d at 1091 \n8  (“[W]e interpret these words according to their ordinary, contemporary, common \n9  meaning.”).  Thus, these projects are consistent with the text of § 102(c). \n10  The projects are also within the scope of § 102(a), which gives the Secretary \n11  authority “to take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical \n12  barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal \n13  entrants).”  With regard to the replacement project, Plaintiff appears to suggest that \n14  “additional physical barriers” must mean new barriers in locations where no barrier \n15  currently exists.  But Plaintiff cannot show that such a narrow construction is required.  \n16  Dictionary definitions of “additional,” include flexible words such as “more,” “extra,” \n17  and “added.”  See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989 (“Existing in addition, \n18  coming by way of addition; added”); Websters New World College Dictionary, 3rd \n19  ed. 1988 (“added, more, extra”); Random House College Dictionary, revised ed. 1980 \n20  (“added, supplementary”).  Thus the term readily includes not only locations where no \n21  barrier currently exists on the border, see H.R. Rep. 104-828, at 200 (Sept. 24, 1996) \n22  (Conf. Rep.) (calling “for extension of the new fencing” for the full 14 miles near San \n23  Diego); but also new barriers parallel to existing ones, see id. (calling for construction \n24  of “second and third fences” near San Diego), and adding “more” to an existing \n25  barrier, e.g., making it higher or more resistant to illegal entry.  See Griffith, 842 F.2d \n26  at 494 (rejecting ultra vires challenge where agency’s approach was “not the only \n27  possible interpretation of the statutory language” but “surely a colorable one”).  The \n28 \n  23 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.186   Page 36 of 56\n \n1  legislative history for later amendments support this flexibility.  See H.R. Rep. 109-72 \n2  at 170 (May 3, 2005) (explaining that § 102 “provides for construction and \n3  strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders”); 152 Cong. Rec. S9871 (Sept. 21, \n4  2006) (attached as Ex. 9) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (discussing “replacing” existing \n5  fencing, in part because it “is deteriorating”).  And § 102(b) suggests that part of the \n6  § 102(a) mandate can be fulfilled by adding “lighting, cameras, and sensors” to \n7  existing barriers.  See, e.g., § 102(b)(1)(A) (instructing DHS to carry out § 102(a), in \n8  part, by “constructing reinforced fencing” and “provid[ing] for the installation of \n9  additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors”).  \n10  The prototypes project involves “initial construction,” 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 134, so \n11  the basis for Plaintiff’s objection is not apparent.  In any event, the Act makes clear \n12  that the Secretary’s authority encompasses more than the “physical barriers and roads” \n13  themselves, both by including whatever “actions . . . may be necessary” for their \n14  installation and by illustrating the point with an action that is not installation or \n15  construction at all—“removal of obstacles to detection.”  Id.  The prototypes project \n16  meets two aspects of this language—(1) the prototypes are “physical barriers” that are \n17  intended “to deter illegal crossings” in the area, see 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (stating that \n18  the location and “robust physical characteristics” of the prototypes “are intended to \n19  deter illegal crossings”), and (2) they are actions the Secretary deemed necessary to \n20  prepare for future installation of barriers.  See id. (“to evaluate various design features \n21  for potential inclusion in a border wall standard . . . [to be] utilized as a part of border \n22  wall construction going forward”). \n23  But perhaps the best ground for rejecting Plaintiff’s theory is that it would \n24  produce absurd results that conflict with clear congressional intent.  Plaintiff, to the \n25  extent it seeks a narrow construction of § 102(a), would leave DHS without express \n26  authority to repair or replace a section of wall damaged by illegal immigrants or a \n27  natural disaster.  Similarly, CBP could not replace or improve a barrier that proved \n28 \n  24 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.187   Page 37 of 56\n \n1  operationally ineffective, even if the defect was discovered shortly after it was put up.  \n2  Such actions would not be “initial construction.”  And to the extent Plaintiff suggests \n3  § 102(c) alone is limited to “initial construction,” it can identify no textual basis for \n4  the distinction.  Nor would it be consistent with Congress’ goal to “gain operational \n5  control” of the border, § 102(b)(1)(A), (D), for barriers built using waiver authority to \n6  fall back under legal requirements that could require their removal or prevent their \n7  repair.  See, e.g., Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 17 (explaining that in \n8  “national wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” other statutes prohibit the \n9  Department of the Interior from “permitting the construction of certain border security \n10  infrastructure” in the absence of a waiver).  \n11  3.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(c) unambiguously requires \nthat the Federal Register notice of a waiver determination \n12  include a detailed “rationale” \n13 \nPlaintiff next argues that the Secretary did not include “any rationale \n14 \ndemonstrating that” the 15-mile project area “is necessary to ‘deter illegal crossings in \n15 \nareas of high illegal entry into the United States.’”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 135 (quoting \n16 \nIIRIRA § 102(a)).  But nothing in § 102(c) requires explaining the basis for the \n17 \ndetermination.  Instead, the Act requires only that the Secretary’s decision be \n18 \n“published in the Federal Register,” § 102(c)(1), which has been done here.  Congress \n19 \nexplained that the limited purpose of the publication requirement was to “ensur[e] \n20 \nappropriate public notice of such determinations,” H.R. Rep. 109-72, at 170 (May 3, \n21 \n2005) (Conf. Rep.), without any suggestion that the notice need include a detailed \n22 \nrationale or facilitate judicial review.  Indeed, two aspects of the IIRIRA compel the \n23 \nconclusion that, unlike ordinary actions subject to review under the APA, see, e.g., \n24 \nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 833 F.3d 1136, 1150 (9th Cir. \n25 \n2016), the agency need not provide a rationale sufficient to enable arbitrary and \n26 \ncapricious review.  First, Congress barred all non-constitutional claims.  See supra \n27 \nArg. § I.  Challenges to the Secretary’s application of the statutory criteria are not \n28 \n  25 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.188   Page 38 of 56\n \n1  constitutional claims, thus the rationale for that application is not necessary to \n2  facilitate the limited judicial review available.  Second, the Act makes clear that the \n3  determination is made “in [the] Secretary’s sole discretion.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1); see \n4  also Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 690 (9th Cir. 2003) \n5  (observing that “many of the other provisions of the IIRIRA . . . do in fact specify that \n6  particular decisions are within the sole or unreviewable discretion of the Attorney \n7  General”).  Even if review were permitted under the APA,18 agency action under this \n8  provision would not be subject to judicial review because it is “committed to agency \n9  discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); cf. Great Old Broads For Wilderness v. \n10  Kempthorne, 452 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2006) (concluding § 701(a)(2) applied \n11  “where Congress provided for “determin[ation of] the priority and timing for \n12  completing required environmental analysis of grazing allotments” “in [the \n13  Secretary’s] sole discretion”).  It is clear that Congress intended the Secretary’s \n14  rationale to be unreviewable.   \n15  Ultra vires review should, at most, reach no further than confirming that the \n16  Secretary made the findings required by the statutory language.  See IIRIRA \n17  § 102(c)(1) (granting the Secretary authority “to waive all legal requirements such \n18  Secretary . . . determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n19  and roads under this section”).  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281 (looking only for \n20  violation of “a clear statutory mandate or prohibition”); Am. Airlines, 176 F.3d at 293 \n21  (“a plain violation of an unambiguous and mandatory provision of the statute”).  \n22  Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, the Secretary did find specifically that the 15-mile \n23  project area “is an area of high illegal entry.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (“I determine that \n24  the following area . . . within the United States Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector . . . \n25  is an area of high illegal entry: Starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending to \n26 \n                                           \n27  18  APA review is doubly impermissible here because Congress barred such claims, § \n102(c)(2)(A), and because the DHS Secretary waived application of the APA to this \n28  project.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985. \n  26 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.189   Page 39 of 56\n \n1  approximately one mile east of Border Monument 251.”).19  This is sufficient to \n2  satisfy ultra vires review and this determination, well within the Secretary’s expertise \n3  and delegated “sole discretion,” should not be subject to judicial second-guessing.  \n4  While Plaintiff is incredulous that this area could qualify, 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 136, the \n5  Secretary further explained that “construction of border infrastructure and other \n6  operational improvements have improved border security in the San Diego Sector; \n7  however, more work needs to be done,” and that the “San Diego Sector remains an \n8  area of high illegal entry for which there is an immediate need to construct additional \n9  border barriers and roads.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35984.  \n10  Congress set no specific threshold for “high illegal entry,” and the Secretary’s \n11  conclusion is reasonable.  The Secretary noted publically-available statistics showing \n12  that the San Diego Sector remains a problem, with “over 31,000 illegal aliens” \n13  apprehended in the sector in fiscal year 2016, and large amounts of illegal drugs \n14  seized.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35984.  The sector had the fourth-largest number of \n15  apprehensions nationwide.  See U.S. Border Patrol, Sector Profile – Fiscal Year 2016 \n16  (link) (attached as Ex. 18) (after the Rio Grande Valley, Tucson, and Laredo Sectors).  \n17  These facts certainly exceed whatever lower threshold could be set for “high illegal \n18  entry,” especially when measured against Congress’ definition of “operational \n19  control” of the border—“the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, \n20  including . . . unlawful aliens, . . . narcotics, and other contraband.”  Public Law 109-\n21  367 § 2(b).  And the legislative history for the Act demonstrates that Congress was \n22  well aware that this corridor between San Diego and Tijuana has long been a source of \n23  significant illegal entry into the United States.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H554-555 \n24 \n                                           \n19 The Secretary also made several other findings specific to the project area:  that \n25 \nthere “is presently a need to construct . . . the infrastructure projects described in \n26 \nSection 1,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985, that these projects involve “physical barriers and \nroads” as those terms are used in the Act, id., and that it is “necessary that I exercise \n27 \nthe authority that is vested in me by section 102(c)” in order to “ensure the \n28 \nexpeditious construction of the barriers and roads.”  Id.  \n  27 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.190   Page 40 of 56\n \n1  (statements of Cong. Hunter, Cong. Sensenbrenner); 150 Cong. Rec. H8899 (Oct. 8, \n2  2004) (statement of Cong. Hunter) (attached as Ex. 5). \n3  Finally, Plaintiff appears to object to the use of sector-wide statistics to support \n4  the finding of high illegal entry.  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 135.  But Congress itself \n5  frequently referred to sector-wide statistics in discussing the need for such projects.  \n6  See, e.g., 152 Cong. Rec. S9873 (Sept. 21, 2006) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (citing sector \n7  wide statistics in support of Secure Fence Act); 151 Cong. Rec. H453 (Feb. 9, 2005) \n8  (statement of Cong. Hart) (relying on San Diego Sector-wide statistics to support \n9  completion of three mile segment of border barrier under REAL ID Act); id. H467 \n10  (statement of Cong. Cox) (same); id. H471 (statement of Cong. Bono) (same).  And \n11  nothing in the Act requires the Secretary to publish more granular data to prove that \n12  the finding committed to his “sole discretion” was warranted. \n \n13  4.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(c) waiver authority has \nunambiguously expired \n14 \nPlaintiff’s final ultra vires theory is that the § 102(c) waiver authority has \n15 \nexpired.  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 137-140.  Plaintiff argues that the phrase “necessary \n16 \nto ensure expeditious construction” must be determined in relation to the date the \n17 \nwaiver provision was enacted in 2005.  See id. ¶ 139 (“as soon as possible after the \n18 \n[2005 REAL ID Act’s] enactment”).  But nothing in the text of the Act suggests that \n19 \nCongress intended the waiver authority to sunset.  Instead, the temporal focus of the \n20 \nwaiver provision is on the completion of each construction project under the Act.  As \n21 \nlong as Congress continues to appropriate money for such projects, it stands to reason \n22 \nthat CBP should seek to ensure expeditious construction of them pursuant to the terms \n23 \nof § 102.20  While not all such construction may require a waiver, § 102(c)(1) \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n20 See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-31, Div. F, Title \n26  VI, 131 Stat. 135, 434 (May 5, 2017) (appropriating $341 million “to replace \napproximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian and vehicle border fencing \n27 \nalong the southwest border . . . and to add gates to existing barriers” and $77 million \n“for new border road construction”); DHS Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-\n28 \n4, 129 Stat. 39, 42 (Mar. 4, 2015) (appropriating $382 million “[f]or expenses for \n  28 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.191   Page 41 of 56\n \n1  indicates that waivers are appropriate where “necessary to ensure expeditious \n2  construction”—meaning at least that they can be issued when “expeditious \n3  construction” would not occur in the absence of a waiver.  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).   \n4  Indeed, Plaintiff obliquely acknowledges that this theory falls apart if one \n5  accepts that the waiver authority extends to “construction of additional barriers that \n6  have not been specifically directed by Congress [in § 102(b)].”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 140.  \n7  As discussed above, § 102(c) waiver authority is not limited to the projects identified \n8  by Congress in § 102(b).  See supra, Arg. § II(B)(1).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s theory \n9  gains no support from the fact that Congress, in 2007, set deadlines under § 102(b)(1) \n10  for selection of certain “priority areas” and completion of construction in those areas.  \n11  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 139.  Instead, the specific deadlines for certain actions \n12  undermines Plaintiff’s attempt to infer from congressional silence that the authority \n13  granted in § 102(c) sunsets at some unspecified date.  If Congress intended this \n14  authority to sunset, it would have written that in the text. \n15  The Secretary’s necessity determination readily meets the textual standard here.  \n16  Congress crafted the waiver provision because litigation by environmental groups and \n17  opposition from California state agencies was preventing “expeditious construction.”  \n18  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (“Continued delays \n19  caused by litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with \n20  respect to other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security \n21  infrastructure along the border.”); see also 151 Cong. Rec. H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) \n22  (statement of Congressman Royce); Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 8 \n23  (statement of Rep. Hunter).  The vigorous opposition Plaintiff, other environmental \n24  organizations, and the state of California have displayed here in filing three lawsuits \n25  likewise suggests that construction today would be substantially delayed in the \n26  absence of a waiver.  In addition to the delay of litigation, Congress  was well aware \n27 \n                                           \n28  border security fencing, infrastructure, and technology”). \n  29 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.192   Page 42 of 56\n \n1  that the formal procedures for laws like NEPA and the ESA have been used to \n2  significantly delay major infrastructure projects, both public and private, for years \n3  even before the commencement of litigation, in the hope of stopping a given project \n4  altogether.21  Plaintiff has not suggested—and cannot—that expeditious construction \n5  would occur in the absence of a waiver. \n6  In sum, each of Plaintiff’s ultra vires theories fails to justify judicial intrusion \n7  on a decision Congress committed to the Secretary’s “sole discretion.”  \n8  III.  PLAINTIFF’S CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS FAIL TO STATE A \nCLAIM \n9 \nCongress limited judicial review of the Secretary’s exercise of § 102(c) waiver \n10 \nauthority to constitutional claims regarding “any action undertaken, or any decision \n11 \nmade, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to [§ 102(c)(1)].”  Each of the \n12 \nconstitutional claims Plaintiff raises in Counts 2, 3, and 4, fails to state a claim upon \n13 \nwhich relief can be granted. \n14 \nA.  The Secretary’s Action Does Not Violate Article II § 3 (Count 2) \n15 \nPlaintiff argues that exercise of the waiver authority Congress provided in law \n16 \nconstitutes failure to “faithfully execute” the waived laws.  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 146.  \n17 \nThis claim fails for numerous reasons. \n18 \nArticle II, Section 3 of the Constitution states that the President “shall take care \n19 \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.”  This clause creates and vests personally in the \n20 \nPresident the authority to supervise officers of the Executive Branch in the \n21 \nperformance of their duties.  See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Bd., \n22 \n23 \n                                           \n24  21  As noted above, see supra Background § II, Congress did not abandon \nenvironmental or resource concerns but gave DHS the responsibility to consult \n25 \nrelevant resource agencies and other constituencies under § 102(b)(1)(C).  Plaintiff \nasserts that DHS has failed to comply with § 102(b)(1)(C), see 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 84, \n26 \nbut does not specifically ground any of its ultra vires theories on this claim.  See id. ¶¶ \n27  123-141.  Regardless, this provision is not privately enforceable.  See Texas Border \nCoal. v. Napolitano, 614 F. Supp. 2d 54, (D.D.C. 2009) (concluding that “no private \n28  right of action or private remedy has been created” to enforce this section). \n  30 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.193   Page 43 of 56\n \n1  561 U.S. 477, 495-96 (2010).  And it ensures that the President is principally \n2  responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch and directly accountable to the \n3  people through the political process.  Id. at 3154-55; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, \n4  689-90 (1988); Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 712-13 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring). \n5  As an initial matter, Plaintiff’s attempt to plead a Take Care Clause claim fails \n6  because Plaintiff challenges a decision by the Secretary of Homeland Security, not an \n7  action of the President.  The Clause does not direct the President’s subordinate \n8  officers in the performance of their duties.  See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493 \n9  (“It is his responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck \n10  stops with the President, in Harry Truman’s famous phrase.”); cf. Printz v. United \n11  States, 521 U.S. 898, 922-23 (1997) (concluding that if Congress could “simply \n12  requir[e] state officials to execute [federal] laws” this would reduce the President’s \n13  Take Care Clause power).  Any claim that might be attempted under the Take Care \n14  Clause would necessarily require the courts to evaluate the decisions and actions of \n15  the President himself, not others in the Executive Branch.  And Plaintiff identifies no \n16  cause of action to raise such a claim.  The Take Care Clause itself does not furnish a \n17  right to sue to challenge the President’s action or inaction.  Cf. Armstrong v. \n18  Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1383-84 (2015) (concluding that the \n19  Supremacy Clause does not provide a cause of action). \n20  Moreover, a case, such as this one, that seeks relief against an agency rather \n21  than the President asks the Court to direct the actions of subordinate officers on the \n22  basis of the Take Care Clause, which would require exercising authority that the \n23  Clause commits to the President himself rather than to courts.  The courts lack \n24  jurisdiction over a claim where there is “a textually demonstrable constitutional \n25  commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department.”  Nixon v. United States, \n26  506 U.S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962)); see also \n27  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 US 821, 830 (1985).

Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, \n4  827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part).  The courts’ refusal to police the \n5  President’s discretionary acts is “a functionally mandated incident of the President’s \n6  unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and \n7  supported by our history.”  Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 749 (1982).  The \n8  Supreme Court has held that “the duty of the President in the exercise of the power to \n9  see that the laws are faithfully executed” is not judicially enforceable, adding that any \n10  attempt by the judiciary to oversee the President’s Take Care authority “might be \n11  justly characterized . . . as ‘an absurd and excessive extravagance.’”  Mississippi, 71 \n12  U.S. at 499 (refusing to review President’s enforcement of Reconstruction Acts given \n13  the “general principles which forbid judicial interference with the exercise of \n14  Executive discretion”).  See also Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 474-75 (1994) \n15  (refusing to address whether President improperly closed a military base because \n16  judicial review “is not available” when a statute or constitutional provision “commits \n17  the decision to the discretion of the President”). \n18  No court has ever treated the Take Care Clause as basis for affirmative relief.22  \n19  But even if this Court entered those uncharted constitutional waters here, Plaintiff’s \n20  theory is incoherent.  Any judicial enforcement of this Clause would necessarily be \n21 \n                                           \n22 \n22 Most discussions of the Take Care Clause has emphasized the need to protect the \nPresident’s Article II power from intrusion by Congress or the courts. See, e.g., Free \n23 \nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 484 (“The President cannot ‘take Care that the Laws be \n24  faithfully executed’ if he cannot oversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute \nthem.”); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 577 (1992) (holding that it \n25 \nwould be improper for the courts to take over the President’s duty to “take Care that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed”); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 761 (1984) \n26 \n(declining to recognize Article III standing where adjudication of claim would \n27  interfere with President’s Take Care Clause authority); Franklin, 505 U.S. at 827-28  \n(Scalia, J., concurring) (stating that Court cannot order relief that would interfere with \n28  President’s constitutional responsibility under the Take Care Clause).   \n  32 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.195   Page 45 of 56\n \n1  driven by separation of powers concerns.  But under the IIRIRA, the Executive \n2  Branch does not waive laws on its own initiative.  Instead, Congress itself instructed \n3  that laws be waived under certain conditions and provided the Secretary with “sole \n4  discretion” to determine when those conditions had been met.  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  \n5  Thus, the waiver itself should be considered “faithful execut[ion]” of an act of \n6  Congress, not a breach of any duty to enforce the laws.  This is especially the case \n7  here because Congress targeted for waiver the very laws Plaintiff wishes had not been \n8  waived—NEPA and the ESA.  See Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(c) \n9  (providing for waiver of “the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the National \n10  Environmental Policy Act of 1969” as originally enacted in 1996); Pub. L. No. 109-\n11  13, Div. B, Title I § 102 (expanding waiver authority to “all legal requirements”). \n12  Finally, Plaintiff also attempts to recast its ultra vires challenge as a claim \n13  under the Take Care Clause, suggesting that the “conditions and limitations of IIRIRA \n14  section 102 itself” should be enforced on constitutional grounds.  2d Am. Compl. ¶ \n15  145.  But a claim that Executive Branch officials have violated a statutory command \n16  does not give rise to a constitutional claim.  “The distinction between claims that an \n17  official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in \n18  violation of the Constitution, on the other, is . . . well established.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. \n19  at 474.  “[C]laims simply alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory \n20  authority are not ‘constitutional’ claims[] subject to judicial review.”  Id. at 473.  \n21  Thus, respondents cannot transform their garden-variety ultra vires claim into a \n22  constitutional one by alleging that the Secretary’s specific use of a statutory authority \n23  constitutes failure to comply with a statute and amounts to a violation of President’s \n24  constitutional responsibilities under Article II. \n25  B.  The Secretary’s Action Does Not Violate the Nondelegation Doctrine \n(Count 3) \n26 \nPlaintiff claims that § 102(c) “unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to \n27 \nthe DHS Secretary.”  2d Am.

Records Litig. \n4  (hereinafter “Telecomm. Records”), 671 F.3d 881, 895 (9th Cir. 2011).  Every court to \n5  consider a nondelegation challenge to § 102(c) has rejected it, beginning with a \n6  decision in this district.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *16-25; \n7  see also County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *2-4; Save Our Heritage, 533 F. \n8  Supp. 2d at 63-64; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 126-29.  Plaintiff’s claim \n9  must likewise fail. \n10  It is well established that, because Congress could not function without the \n11  ability to delegate, Congress may authorize another branch of government to carry out \n12  its law-making authority so long as it provides “an intelligible principle to which the \n13  person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.”  J.W. Hampton, Jr. Co. v. \n14  United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  To provide a constitutionally permissible \n15  “intelligible principle,” Congress need only “clearly delineate[] the general policy, the \n16  public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.” \n17  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372-73 (1989).  Statutory limitations on \n18  judicial review are irrelevant.  See United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1041-45 \n19  (9th Cir. 1992) (rejecting the argument that “a delegation of legislative power that is \n20  statutorily exempt from judicial review violate[s] the nondelegation doctrine”). \n21  Section 102(c) meets each of these three requirements and is thus \n22  constitutionally sufficient.  Section 102(a) delineates a “general policy” of installing \n23  infrastructure to “deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United \n24  States,” which § 102(c) incorporates by tying the waiver authority to “expeditious \n25  construction of barriers and roads under this section.”  This establishes a policy to \n26  guide the Secretary:  that improving border protection by expediting the construction \n27  of necessary barriers and roads is a high Congressional priority.  The Act also \n28 \n  34 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.197   Page 47 of 56\n \n1  specifies who is to “apply” the general policy—“the Secretary of Homeland Security.”  \n2  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  The “boundaries of this delegated authority” are also clearly \n3  delineated.  The authority may only be exercised to “waive all legal requirements [the] \n4  Secretary . . . determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n5  and roads under this section.”  Id. § 102(c)(1) (emphasis added).  Thus, the waiver \n6  authority is limited to construction along the border for which a necessity \n7  determination has been made.  The Supreme Court has held that a “necessity” \n8  standard “fits comfortably within the scope of discretion permitted by [its] precedent.”  \n9  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475-76 (2001); see also Touby v. \n10  United States, 500 U.S. 160, 163 (1991) (approving delegation to the Attorney \n11  General the authority to designate a drug as a controlled substance for purposes of \n12  criminal drug enforcement if doing so was “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to \n13  the public safety”).  And each district court to consider § 102(c) has found the \n14  necessity determination to provide a sufficient boundary.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. \n15  Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *21; County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *3-4; Save Our \n16  Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 63-64; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127-28.   \n17  Moreover, Congress may delegate in even broader terms than generally used \n18  where the delegation relates to powers over which the Executive Branch already \n19  maintains significant independent control.  See Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, \n20  772 (1996) (finding that delegations may be broader “where the entity exercising the \n21  delegated authority itself possesses independent authority over the subject matter”); \n22  Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 897 (holding that when the delegation “arises within \n23  the realm of national security . . . the intelligible principle standard need not be overly \n24  rigid”).  The IIRIRA, which relates to matters of immigration policy, foreign affairs, \n25  and national security, falls squarely within these areas.  See, e.g., Knauff v. \n26  Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542-43 (1950) (“The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental \n27  act of sovereignty . . .

LEXIS 44244, at *22-23 (“[T]he \n2  Executive Branch has independent and significant constitutional authority [over] \n3  immigration and border control enforcement and national security.”).  \n4  In sum, the Act contains a sufficiently intelligible principle to survive \n5  constitutional scrutiny and Plaintiff’s claims to the contrary should be dismissed.  \n6  C.  The Secretary’s Action Does Not Violate Article I § 7 (Count 4) \n7  Plaintiff argues that § 102(c) and the waiver determination at issue here “are \n8  unconstitutional infringements upon the lawmaking procedures required under Article \n9  I, § 7 of the Constitution.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 157.  Clauses 2 and 3 of Article I, § 7 are \n10  called the “presentment clauses.”  See United States v. Scampini, 911 F.2d 350, 351 \n11  (9th Cir. 1990).  They “require that all legislation be presented to the President so that \n12  he may have the opportunity to exercise his veto power before any legislation \n13  becomes law.”  Id.  Plaintiff does not argue that IIRIRA did not conform to the \n14  Presentment Clauses when it was enacted.  Instead it argues that permitting existing \n15  statutes to be waived for certain purposes constitutes “amendment and repeal of \n16  statutes.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 155 (quoting INS v. Chada, 462 U.S. 919, 954 (1983)).  \n17  Plaintiff’s claim is meritless, and both courts to consider such a challenge to § 102(c) \n18  have rejected it.  See County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *6-7; Defenders of \n19  Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 123-26. \n20  The Presentment Clauses require a specific process, prohibiting legislative \n21  action that does not conform to it.  Thus, the Constitution does not authorize the \n22  President “to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 \n23  U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  In Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto \n24  Act, which gave the President the authority to “cancel” certain appropriated spending \n25  items that had been passed by Congress.  524 U.S. at 438.  That statute failed because \n26  cancellation prevented the items “from having legal force or effect” and thus in “both \n27  legal and practical effect, the President has amended two Acts of Congress by \n28 \n  36 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.199   Page 49 of 56\n \n1  repealing a portion of each.”  Id.; see also id. at 447 (holding it improper to give the \n2  President “unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes”).  \n3  Plaintiff’s claim fails because waiver of a legal requirement for a specific \n4  purpose is not amendment or repeal of a statute.  As Defenders of Wildlife explained: \n5  [t]he Secretary has no authority to alter the text of any statute, repeal any \nlaw, or cancel any statutory provision, in whole or in part. Each of the [] \n6 \nlaws waived by the Secretary . . . retains the same legal force and effect \n7  as it had when it was passed by both houses of Congress and presented to \nthe President. \n8 \n527 F. Supp. 2d at 124.  Under the waiver, the waived statutes are inapplicable only \n9 \nwith respect to the construction of barriers and roads along the relevant portion of the \n10 \nborder.  The statutes retain their general legal force and effect because the Secretary’s \n11 \nwaiver extends to only a tiny fraction of the universe of cases to which NEPA and \n12 \nsimilar statutes apply.  Plaintiff has identified no basis to conclude that such waivers \n13 \nviolate the Constitution.  See Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F.3d 41, 64 n.3 (D.C. Cir. \n14 \n2004) (Roberts, J., concurring) (dismissing constitutional challenge to statute \n15 \npermitting President to make inapplicable to Iraq “any other provision of law that \n16 \napplies to countries that have supported terrorism” because the authorized actions “are \n17 \na far cry from the line-item veto at issue in Clinton, and are instead akin to the waivers \n18 \nthat the President is routinely empowered to make in other areas, particularly in the \n19 \nrealm of foreign policy”). \n20 \nIndeed, this waiver authority is similar to an “executive grant of immunity or \n21 \nwaiver of claim” which “has never been recognized as a form of legislative repeal.”  \n22 \nSee Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 895.  The Ninth Circuit rejected a Presentment \n23 \nClause challenge to 50 U.S.C. § 1885a, which permits the Attorney General “to \n24 \nimmunize from suit telecommunications companies that had cooperated with the \n25 \ngovernment’s intelligence gathering.”  Id. at 891.  Even though such grants of \n26 \nimmunity prevent civil actions to enforce the otherwise applicable “law governing \n27 \nelectronic surveillance,” the Circuit found no constitutional defect because “[t]he law \n28 \n  37 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.200   Page 50 of 56\n \n1  remains as it was when Congress approved it and the President signed it.”  Id. at 894-\n2  95.  The Circuit also supported its conclusion by noting that the authority for \n3  executive officials to “trigger a defense or immunity for a third party,” is “not \n4  uncommon.”  Id. at 895.  Here, similarly, the § 102(c) authority in one statute granting \n5  authority to waive application of one or more other statutes is not uncommon.  See \n6  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 125 & n.5 (collecting some of the “myriad \n7  examples of waiver provisions in federal statutes”); see also, e.g., 25 U.S.C. § 3406 \n8  (authorizing “Secretary of each Federal agency providing funds” for program to waive \n9  “any statutory requirement, regulation, policy, or procedure promulgated by that \n10  agency”); Pub. L. No. 109-171, § 5107(a)(2), 120 Stat. 42 (Feb. 6, 2006) (providing \n11  for waiver of “such provisions of law . . . as are necessary to implement [specified \n12  statutory provision] on a timely basis”).   \n13  Nor does § 102(c) raise the same separation of powers concerns that were at \n14  issue in Clinton.  There, the Supreme Court was concerned that the President’s line-\n15  item veto was “rejecting the policy judgment made by Congress and relying on his \n16  own policy judgment.”  524 U.S. at 444.  But here, Congress unmistakably expressed \n17  its policy judgment that construction of the barriers and roads along the border was of \n18  such importance that it justified waiving application of environmental and other laws \n19  to the extent those laws threaten expeditious construction.  See IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  \n20  Thus, in sharp contrast to Clinton, there is no question that the Secretary is executing \n21  (rather than rejecting) the will of Congress.  Cf. Smith v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., \n22  280 F. Supp. 2d 314, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (upholding waiver where “[u]nlike in \n23  Clinton” the President “is carrying out, not rejecting, a policy made by Congress”).  \n24  Accordingly, each of Plaintiff’s constitutional claims should be dismissed. \n25  IV.  PLAINTIFF’S NEPA AND ESA CLAIMS MUST BE \nDISMISSED (COUNTS 5-6) \n26 \nBecause the waiver determination pursuant to IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) is valid and \n27 \nsurvives any available judicial review as discussed above, see supra, Arg. §§ I-III, \n28 \n  38 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.201   Page 51 of 56\n \n1  both NEPA and the ESA have been waived as to the challenged projects being \n2  conducted by Defendants:  \n3  [P]ursuant to section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA, I hereby waive in their \nentirety, with respect to the construction of roads and physical barriers . . \n4 \n. in the Project Area, the following statutes . . . :  The National \n5  Environmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (Jan. 1, 1970) \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)); the Endangered Species Act (Pub. L. 93-205, \n6 \n87 Stat. 884 (Dec. 28, 1973) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)) . . . . \n7 \n82 Fed. Reg. at 35985.  Accordingly, the claims in Counts 5 and 6 have been \n8 \nextinguished and the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant any relief pursuant to those \n9 \nstatutes.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *7, 39-40. \n10 \nIn addition, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the ESA claims in Count 6 \n11 \nbecause Plaintiff failed to provide the mandatory notice prerequisite to suit.  Plaintiff’s \n12 \nESA claim must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Plaintiff did not provide \n13 \n“written notice of the violation” to the “Secretary [of Interior], and to any alleged \n14 \nviolator of any such provision or regulation,” prior to filing this suit.  16 U.S.C. \n15 \n§ 1540(g)(2)(A); Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 143 \n16 \nF.3d 515, 520 (9th Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs can fulfill this sixty-day notice requirement \n17 \nonly by sending a notice after the alleged violation has occurred.  See Friends of \n18 \nAnimals v. Ashe, No. 13-1607, 2014 WL 2812313, at *7 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding that \n19 \n“pre-violation” notices of intent to sue are “insufficient to satisfy the ESA’s 60-day \n20 \nnotice requirement”); Kern Cnty. Farm Bureau v. Badgley, No. 02-5376, 2002 WL \n21 \n34236869, at *13 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2002) (“[O]ne cannot give notice of a violation \n22 \nwhich has not yet happened.”).  Here, Plaintiff has not complied with this requirement \n23 \nbecause it prematurely sent the purported notice letters in June and July 2017, see 2d \n24 \nAm. Compl. ¶ 5, before any violation had occurred.  These purported notice letters \n25 \npreceded the award of contracts for the challenged projects and the commencement of \n26 \nconstruction.  See Press Releases (Sept. 7 & Aug. 31, 2017).  In light of the fact that \n27 \nthe ESA claim has been extinguished by the waiver, the Court need not reach this \n28 \n  39 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.202   Page 52 of 56\n \n1  notice issue. However, it does provide an additional ground for dismissal and \n2  Defendants can provide more fulsome briefing on the issue if the Court so wishes.  \n3  V.  PLAINTIFF’S APA CLAIM MUST BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE \nFOIA PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE REMEDY (COUNT 7, IN PART) \n4 \nThe APA does not provide jurisdiction or a cause of action for relief related to \n5 \nthe processing of Plaintiff’s FOIA requests because the FOIA itself provides an \n6 \nadequate remedy.  “[F]ederal courts lack jurisdiction over APA challenges whenever \n7 \nCongress has provided another ‘adequate remedy.’”  Brem–Air Disposal v. Cohen, \n8 \n156 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704); 5 U.S.C. § 704 \n9 \n(subjecting to judicial review “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \n10 \nremedy in a court”).  “If a plaintiff can bring suit against the responsible federal \n11 \nagencies under a citizen-suit provision, this action precludes an additional suit under \n12 \nthe APA.”  Brem, 156 F.3d at 1005; see also Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, \n13 \n903 (1988) (“Congress did not intend the general grant of review in the APA to \n14 \nduplicate existing procedures for review of agency action.”).  Because the FOIA \n15 \ncontains a citizen-suit provision and provides an adequate remedy, a “related APA \n16 \nclaim will be precluded.”  Bedgood v. Mabus, No. 15-454, 2015 WL 3647933, at *4-5 \n17 \n(S.D. Cal. June 8, 2015).  See also Animal Legal Defense Fund v. U.S. Dep’t of \n18 \nAgriculture, No. 17-949, 2017 WL 3478848, at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 14, 2017); Lion \n19 \nRaisins, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 636 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1115 (E.D. Cal. \n20 \n2009).  Accordingly, the APA claims in Count 7 must be dismissed for lack of subject \n21 \nmatter jurisdiction. \n22 \nCONCLUSION \n23 \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss Counts 1 through 6 in full, \n24 \nand Count 7 in part for lack of jurisdiction. \n25 \n \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  40 \nDefs.’ Motion to Dismiss  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 18-1   Filed 10/06/17   PageID.203   Page 53 of 56\n \n1  Dated:  October 6, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n2  CHAD A.

In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiff Center for \n3 Biological Diversity (“the Center”)—an environmental conservation organization \n4 that works to protect native wildlife species and their habitats—challenges the \n5 failure of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and U.S. Customs \n6 and  Border  Protection  (“CBP”)  (collectively,  “the  Agencies”  or  “Federal \n7 Defendants”)  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  National  Environmental \n8 Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., the Endangered Species Act \n9 (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq., and the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), \n10 5 U.S.C. § 552, in relation to border wall construction projects in San Diego \n11 County, including: (1) the border wall prototype project, which would also serve \n12 as the first new segment of border barrier built in California in several years \n13 (“border wall prototype project”); and (2) the replacement of the westernmost \n14 portion of the existing border fence (14 miles of existing primary and double layer \n15 border fencing running from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern edge of Otay Mesa) \n16 (“border wall replacement project”).    \n17 2.  The  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall  replacement \n18 project are each federal actions that will impact the environment as well as several \n19 threatened and endangered species, and are thus subject to the procedural and \n20 substantive requirements of NEPA and the ESA, respectively.   \n21 3.  Federal  Defendants  have  not  provided  the  Center  or  the  general \n22 public with notice or opportunity to comment under NEPA for the border wall \n23 prototype project or border wall replacement project.  Indeed, the Agencies have \n24 not prepared any NEPA or ESA analysis for either the border wall prototype \n25 project or the border wall replacement project.   \n26 4.  Although  NEPA  does  not  require  a  plaintiff  to  provide  federal \n27 agencies with notice of alleged violations prior to filing suit, on June 1, 2017, the \n28 Center wrote to the Agencies to provide notice of NEPA violations in relation to \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 2                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.99   Page 3 of 50\n1 the  border  wall  prototype  project.    The  Agencies  have  not  acknowledged  or \n2 responded to this Notice.   \n3 5.  In addition, on June 1, 2017, the Center also provided the Agencies \n4 with formal notice of violations of the ESA for their failure to consult with U.S. \n5 Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (“FWS”)  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  border  wall \n6 prototype project does not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened or \n7 endangered species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their \n8 critical habitat.  Similarly, on July 7, 2017, the Center provided the Agencies with \n9 formal notice of ESA violations for their failure to consult with FWS in relation to \n10 the border wall replacement project.  Federal Defendants have failed to remedy \n11 the alleged ESA violations during the 60-day notice period, and thus this second \n12 amended complaint includes those violations.  \n13 6.  In light of the Agencies’ failure and/or refusal to provide the public \n14 with any information regarding their compliance with NEPA, the ESA, and other \n15 environmental laws in relation to the border wall prototype project, on May 2, \n16 2017, the Center submitted two requests for public records pursuant to FOIA, one \n17 to  DHS  and  one  to  CBP,  seeking  records  pertaining  to  the  Agencies’  NEPA \n18 environmental analysis, as well as compliance with other environmental laws, for \n19 the border wall prototype project.   \n20 7.  Defendants have violated FOIA, or alternatively, the Administrative \n21 Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (“APA”), with respect to the Center’s May 2, \n22 2017 FOIA requests for records related to the Agencies’ compliance with NEPA \n23 and other laws in relation to the border wall prototype project.  Although the \n24 Agencies have acknowledged their receipt of the FOIA requests, they have failed \n25 to provide any responsive records or state when they might do so.  Accordingly, \n26 the Agencies are unlawfully withholding the records by failing to search for and \n27 provide all responsive records. \n28 8.  On  August  2,  2017—approximately  a  month  and  a  half  after  the \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 3                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.100   Page 4 of 50\n1 filing of this case—former DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a Determination in \n2 the Federal Register purporting to waive the application of NEPA, the ESA, the \n3 APA, and more than 30 additional laws not at issue in this lawsuit, to “various \n4 border infrastructure projects” in “an approximately fifteen mile segment of the \n5 border within the San Diego Sector that starts at the Pacific Ocean and extends \n6 eastward,”  pursuant  to  section  102(c)  of  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \n7 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”).  Codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 \n8 note.  Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n9 and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, As Amended, 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984.  \n10 According  to  the  Federal  Register  determination,  the  specific  “border \n11 infrastructure projects” subject to the purported waiver include the border wall \n12 prototype project and the border wall replacement project at issue in this litigation.  \n13 Id. \n14 9.  IIRIRA section 102(c)(1) provides that “[n]otwithstanding any other \n15 provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to \n16 waive all legal requirements to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and \n17 roads under this section.”  Once a waiver determination is issued, IIRIRA sections \n18 102(c)(2)(A)-(C) restrict judicial review by providing federal district courts with \n19 exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes of action or claims arising from a waiver, \n20 purporting to limit such causes of action or claims to those alleging a violation of \n21 the Constitution of the United States, requiring such causes of action or claims to \n22 be brought not later than 60 days after the DHS Secretary’s waiver determination, \n23 and  eliminating  appellate  court  review  of  the  district  court  decision  regarding \n24 constitutional claims, and instead only permitting plaintiffs to seek review of the \n25 district  court  decision  on  constitutional  claims  through  a  petition  for  writ  of \n26 certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.    \n27 10.  As  a  threshold  matter,  Plaintiff  Center  for  Biological  Diversity \n28 challenges former DHS Secretary Kelly’s August 2, 2017 waiver determination as \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 4                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.101   Page 5 of 50\n1 ultra vires, because the determination was outside of the scope of authority vested \n2 in the DHS Secretary pursuant to IIRIRA section 102(c).  Specifically, neither the \n3 border wall prototype project nor the border wall replacement project is among \n4 “the barriers and roads” subject to IIRIRA section 102(c) waivers.  Federal courts \n5 are  empowered  to  consider  challenges  to  ultra  vires  executive  actions  despite \n6 language limiting or precluding statutory judicial review such as that found under \n7 IIRIRA section 102(c).  See, e.g., Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 224 (D.C. \n8 Cir. 1998) (“[T]he Veterans’ Administrator cannot issue oil drilling permits—nor \n9 can  the  Secretary  of  Labor  rescind  television  licenses—and  expect  to  escape \n10 judicial review by hiding behind a finality clause.”).    \n11 11.  In addition, Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity alleges that the \n12 DHS Secretary’s August 2, 2017 waiver determination, and the waiver authority \n13 provided by IIRIRA section 102(c) generally,  violate the U.S.  Constitution in \n14 several  respects,  including  the  Take  Care  Clause,  the  Separation  of  Powers \n15 Doctrine, the Non-Delegation Doctrine, and the Presentment Clause. \n16 JURISDICTION \n17 12.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n18 1331 and 1346, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 to 706, 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note, and 5 U.S.C. § \n19 552(a)(4)(B).  The causes of action arise under the laws of the United States, \n20 including NEPA, the ESA, FOIA, the APA, and IIRIRA, and the implementing \n21 regulations  established  pursuant  to  these  federal  statutes,  and  the  U.S. \n22 Constitution.  The relief requested is authorized pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1651 \n23 and 2201 to 2202, and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705 and 706.   \n24 VENUE \n25 13.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  judicial  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § \n26 1391(b) and (e), because the violations are occurring here, and a substantial part \n27 of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims have occurred in this district \n28 due to decisions made by Federal Defendants, and/or failure(s) to act by Federal \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 5                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.102   Page 6 of 50\n1 Defendants.  In addition, venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 5 \n2 U.S.C.  §  552(a)(4)(B),  which  provides  venue  for  FOIA  cases  in  this  district, \n3 because a portion of the responsive records may be found in this district. \n4 PARTIES \n5 14.  Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity is a non-profit environmental \n6 organization  dedicated  to  the  protection  of  native  species  and  their  habitats \n7 through science, policy, and environmental law.  The Center has more than 1.5 \n8 million members and online activists.  The Center is headquartered in Tucson, \n9 Arizona, and has offices in Los Angeles and Oakland in California, as well as \n10 numerous  additional  regional  offices  located  throughout  the  country,  and  an \n11 international office in Baja California Sur, Mexico.  \n12 15.  The Center’s members and staff live in or regularly visit the U.S.-\n13 Mexico  borderlands  region  in  San  Diego  County,  as  well  as  the  borderlands \n14 region  of  Baja  California  Norte,  Mexico.    The  Center’s  members  and  staff \n15 regularly use the myriad federal, state, and local protected lands along the U.S.-\n16 Mexico border in San Diego County, including areas impacted by and/or adjacent \n17 to  the  location  of  the  border  wall  prototype  project  and  the  border  wall \n18 replacement  project,  for  hiking,  camping,  viewing  and  studying  wildlife, \n19 photography,  and  other  vocational  and  recreational  activities.    The  Center’s \n20 members  and  staff  derive  recreational,  spiritual,  professional,  scientific, \n21 educational, and aesthetic benefit from their activities in these areas.  The Center \n22 has  a  long  history  of  environmental  advocacy  within  the  borderlands  region \n23 generally and San Diego County borderlands region specifically.  The Center’s \n24 members and staff have specific intentions to continue to use and enjoy these \n25 areas frequently and on an ongoing basis in the future.    \n26 16.  The Center has an established track record of active participation in \n27 the oversight of government activities and decision-making as well as consistent \n28 practice  of  informing,  educating,  and  counseling  the  public  regarding \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 6                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.103   Page 7 of 50\n1 environmental issues, policies, and laws relating to environmental issues.  The \n2 Center has displayed its ability to disseminate information obtained pursuant to \n3 FOIA to the general public through far-reaching media, including news media, the \n4 Center’s website and newsletters, and social media.  The Center and its members \n5 are harmed by Federal Defendants’ FOIA violations as they preclude the Center \n6 from gaining a comprehensive understanding of the activities, decisions, priorities, \n7 and communications related to the border wall prototype project and border wall \n8 replacement project. \n9 17.    The  Center  has  worked  for  nearly  two  decades  to  oppose \n10 environmentally  harmful  border  fencing  and  other  harmful  border  security \n11 projects  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  generally,  and  the  San  Diego  region \n12 specifically.  The Center also has a long history of advocating for the protection of \n13 rare  wildlife  habitat  that  would  be  impacted  by  the  San  Diego  border  wall \n14 prototype and border wall replacement project, as well as advocating for specific \n15 species that would be harmed by the San Diego border wall prototype and border \n16 wall replacement project, including the western snowy plover, California least \n17 tern,  Quino  checkerspot  butterfly,  San  Diego  and  Riverside  fairy  shrimp,  and \n18 coastal California gnatcatcher.  \n19 18.  The Center and its members’ interests are harmed by Defendants’ \n20 violations of NEPA and the ESA.  The proposed border wall prototype project and \n21 border  wall  replacement  project  will  result  in  construction  of  border  barriers \n22 where none currently exist (in the case of the prototypes), and the construction of \n23 new  border  wall  that  is  much  higher  and  more  impermeable  than  currently \n24 existing border fencing.  The border wall replacement project will entail a massive \n25 construction  operation  with  associated  noise,  lighting,  and  other  impacts,  and \n26 which  will  likely  necessitate  new  land  clearing,  grading,  staging,  and  other \n27 associated activities that will impact the surrounding environment.  The  violations \n28 of NEPA and the ESA, and the construction which will occur without the benefit \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 7                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.104   Page 8 of 50\n1 of compliance with these laws, will negatively impact the wildlife habitat and \n2 imperiled species described above, which will injure the Center and its members’ \n3 aesthetic,  conservation,  recreational,  scientific,  educational,  and  wildlife \n4 preservation  interests  in  those  habitats  and  species.    These  injuries  would  be \n5 redressed by the requested relief directing Defendants to comply with those laws.  \n6 19.  The Center and its members are harmed by the Agencies’ violations \n7 of FOIA, or alternatively the APA, as well as its violations of NEPA, pertaining to \n8 public notice and participation, as such violations will result in harm to the Center \n9 and its members’ interests, and will preclude the Center and its members from \n10 gaining  a  full  understanding  of  the  activities,  decisions,  priorities,  and \n11 communications  related  to  the  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall \n12 replacement project. \n13 20.  The Center and its members are harmed by former DHS Secretary \n14 Kelly’s August 2, 2017 Determination under IIRIRA section 102(c) purporting to \n15 waive NEPA, the ESA, the APA, and more than 30 additional laws not at issue in \n16 this litigation.  In waiving these laws, the August 2, 2017 Determination will \n17 allow the border wall prototype and border wall replacement projects to proceed \n18 without any compliance with NEPA and the ESA.  The absence of environmental \n19 law compliance will negatively impact the wildlife habitat and imperiled species \n20 described  above,  which  will  injure  the  Center  and  its  members’  aesthetic, \n21 conservation,  recreational,  scientific,  educational,  and  wildlife  preservation \n22 interests in those habitats and species.  These injuries would be redressed by the \n23 requested  relief  to  void  the  waiver  determination  as  inapplicable  and \n24 unconstitutional, and directing Defendants to comply with NEPA, the ESA, and \n25 all other applicable laws. The August 2, 2017 Determination will also result in \n26 harm to the Center and its members’ interests by precluding the application of \n27 NEPA,  the  ESA,  and  the  APA,  which  will  preclude  public  notification  and \n28 transparency.   \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 8                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:1 7-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.105   Page 9 of 50\n1 21.  Defendant DHS is an agency within the executive branch of the U.S. \n2 government.  DHS is responsible for ensuring border security along the U.S.-\n3 Mexico border consistent with applicable legal requirements, including NEPA and \n4 the ESA.  In addition, DHS is in possession and control of the records that the \n5 Center seeks under FOIA, and as such, it is subject to FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n6 § 552(f). \n7 22.  Defendant CBP is an agency within DHS.  CBP is responsible for \n8 ensuring border security along the U.S.-Mexico border consistent with applicable \n9 legal  requirements,  including  NEPA  and  the  ESA.    In  addition,  CBP  is  in \n10 possession and control of the records that the Center seeks under FOIA, and as \n11 such, it is subject to FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n12 23.  Defendant Elaine Duke, Acting DHS Secretary, is sued in her official \n13 capacity.    Acting  Secretary  Duke  is  the  official  ultimately  responsible  under \n14 federal  law  for  ensuring  that  the  actions  and  management  decisions  of  DHS \n15 comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  Acting  Secretary  Duke’s \n16 predecessor,  former  DHS  Secretary  John  Kelly,  invoked  the  IIRIRA  section \n17 102(c) waiver in relation to the border wall prototype project and border wall \n18 replacement project on August 2, 2017.   \n19 LEGAL BACKGROUND \n20 A.  NEPA   \n21 24.  NEPA  is  the  “basic  national  charter  for  protection  of  the \n22 environment.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a)(1978).  It was enacted with the ambitious \n23 objectives of “encouraging productive and enjoyable harmony between man and \n24 his environment . . . promoting efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to \n25 the environment and biosphere and stimulating the health and welfare of man; and \n26 enriching  the  understanding  of  the  ecological  systems  and  natural  resources \n27 important to the Nation . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 4321. \n28 25.    In  order  to  achieve  these  goals,  NEPA  contains  several  “action \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 9                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.106   Page 10 of 50\n1 forcing” procedures, most significantly the mandate to prepare an environmental \n2 impact statement (“EIS”) on major Federal actions “significantly affecting the \n3 quality  of  the  human  environment.”    Robertson  v.  Methow  Valley  Citizens \n4 Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).  \n5 26.  The  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (“CEQ”)  was  created  to \n6 administer NEPA and has promulgated NEPA regulations, which are binding on \n7 all federal agencies.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 4342, 4344; 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500–1508 \n8 (1978).  \n9 27.  When a federal agency is not certain whether an EIS is required, it \n10 must prepare a briefer document, known as an environmental assessment (“EA”).  \n11 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9 (1978).  If the agency concludes in an EA that a project may \n12 have significant impacts on the environment, then an EIS must be prepared.  40 \n13 C.F.R. § 1501.4 (1978).  If an EA concludes that there are no significant impacts \n14 to  the  environment,  the  federal  agency  must  provide  a  detailed  statement  of \n15 reasons why the project’s impacts are insignificant and issue a Finding of No \n16 Significant Impact (“FONSI”).  40 C.F.R § 1508.13 (1978). \n17 28.  The  Supreme  Court  has  found  that  the  preparation  and  public \n18 circulation of EISs and EAs promotes NEPA’s broad environmental objectives in \n19 two primary ways: “It ensures that the agency, in reaching its decision, will have \n20 available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning significant \n21 environmental impacts; it also guarantees that the relevant information will be \n22 made  available  to  the  larger  audience  that  may  also  play  a  role  in  both  the \n23 decision-making  process  and  the  implementation  of  that  decision.”    Methow \n24 Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 349. \n25 29.  NEPA requires that “agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with \n26 other planning at the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions \n27 reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to head off \n28 potential conflicts.”  40 C.F.R. § 1501.2 (1978); id. § 1502.5 (1978) (“An agency \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 10                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.107   Page 11 of 50\n1 shall commence preparation of an [EIS] as close as possible to the time the agency \n2 is  developing  or  is  presented  with  a  proposal  .  .  .”).    The  Ninth  Circuit  has \n3 interpreted  these  regulations  as  requiring  the  NEPA  process  to  be  conducted \n4 “before any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.”  Connor v. \n5 Burford, 848 F.2d 1441, 1446 (9th Cir. 1998).  \n6 30.  DHS has not promulgated regulations to implement NEPA, but has \n7 issued an Instruction Manual.  Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Revision 01, \n8 Implementation of NEPA (Nov. 6, 2014) (“DHS NEPA Manual”).  The Manual \n9 specifically includes “proposed construction, land use, activity, or operation that \n10 has  the  potential  to  significantly  affect  environmentally  sensitive  areas”  as  an \n11 action “normally requiring” the preparation of at least an EA.  \n12 31.  Echoing  the  general  NEPA  requirements  regarding  the  need  to \n13 conduct  NEPA  early  in  the  process,  the  DHS  NEPA  Manual  directs  DHS  to \n14 “integrate[] the NEPA process with other planning efforts at the earliest possible \n15 stage so that environmental factors are considered with sufficient time to have a \n16 practical influence on the decision-making process before decisions are made.”  \n17 DHS NEPA Manual, at p. IV-1.  The Manual directs that agency components that \n18 process applications for DHS funding or approval, such as the contracts that have \n19 been and/or will be issued for the border wall prototype project and the border \n20 wall replacement project, “have a responsibility to integrate NEPA requirements \n21 early in the application process,” and to ensure that “completion of the NEPA \n22 process occurs before making a decision to approve” the proposal.  \n23 32.  Other  agencies  which  commonly  contract  with  private  entities  to \n24 build public construction projects, such as the border wall prototype project and \n25 border wall replacement project, have  also promulgated regulations specifying \n26 that  NEPA  must  be  completed  as  early  as  possible  in  the  contracting  or \n27 procurement  process  and  requiring  that  NEPA’s  environmental  and  mitigation \n28 measures must be incorporated into the contract.  See, e.g., 23 C.F.R. § 635.505(b) \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 11                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.108   Page 12 of 50\n1 (2016)  (Department  of  Transportation  (“DOT”)  contracting  agency  “shall  not \n2 perform or contract for construction services (including early work packages of \n3 any kind) prior to the completion of the NEPA process”); id. § 635.505(h) (2016) \n4 (DOT  contract  “must  include  appropriate  provisions  ensuring  that  all \n5 environmental and mitigation measures identified in the NEPA documentation \n6 and committed to in the NEPA determination for the selected alternative will be \n7 implemented.”); 10 C.F.R. § 1021.216(i) (1992) (Department of Energy agencies \n8 shall complete NEPA “before taking any action pursuant to the contract or award \n9 of financial assistance.”).  \n10 33.  NEPA requires that the Agencies involve the public in preparing and \n11 considering  environmental  documents  that  implement  the  Act.    40  C.F.R.  § \n12 1506.6; id. § 1506.6(b)(1) (1978) (requiring federal agencies to “[p]rovide public \n13 notice  of  NEPA-related  hearings,  public  meetings,  and  the  availability  of \n14 environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be \n15 interested or affected”).    \n16 34.   The CEQ regulations further direct federal agencies to “insure that \n17 environmental  information  is  available  to  public  officials  and  citizens  before \n18 decisions  are  made,”  and  mandate  that  “public  scrutiny  [is]  essential  to \n19 implementing NEPA.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b) (1978).   \n20 35.  The Ninth Circuit has held that a “complete failure to involve or even \n21 inform the public” about the agency’s preparation of a NEPA document violates \n22 the statute’s public participation requirements.  Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. \n23 Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 970 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Brodsky v.

As  stated  by  the  Ninth  Circuit,  “general  statements  about \n3 ‘possible  effects’  and  ‘some  risk’  do  not  constitute  a  ‘hard  look’  absent  a \n4 justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.”  \n5 Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Blackwood, 161 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir. \n6 1998) (internal citations omitted).   \n7 B.  Endangered Species Act \n8 37.  The  ESA,  16  U.S.C.  §§  1531–1544,  is  “the  most  comprehensive \n9 legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.”  \n10 TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 180 (1978).  Its fundamental purposes are “to provide a \n11 means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened \n12 species depend may be conserved [and] to provide a program for the conservation \n13 of such endangered species and threatened species . . . .” 16 U.S.C. § 1531(b).   \n14 38.  To achieve these objectives, the ESA directs the Secretary of the \n15 Interior, through the FWS, to determine which species of plants and animals are \n16 “threatened” and “endangered” and place them on the list of protected species.  Id. \n17 § 1533.  An “endangered” or “threatened” species is one “in danger of extinction \n18 throughout  all  or  a  significant  portion  of  its  range,”  or  “likely  to  become \n19 endangered in the near future throughout all or a significant portion of its range,” \n20 respectively.  Id. § 1532(6), (20).   \n21 39.  Once a species is listed, the ESA provides a variety of procedural and \n22 substantive protections to ensure not only the species’ continued survival, but its \n23 ultimate recovery, including the designation of critical habitat, the preparation and \n24 implementation of recovery plans, the prohibition against the “taking” of listed \n25 species, and the requirement for interagency consultation.  Id.  §§ 1533(a)(3), (f), \n26 1538, 1536. \n27 40.  The ESA recognizes that federal agencies, such as DHS and CBP, \n28 have  a  critical  role  to  play  in  meeting  these  statutory  purposes.    The  ESA \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 13                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.110   Page 14 of 50\n1 establishes that it is “the policy of Congress that all Federal departments and \n2 agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and \n3 shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes” of the ESA.  Id. § \n4 1531(c)(1).   \n5 41.  To implement this policy, Section 7(a)(1) of the ESA requires that \n6 “Federal agencies shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of [FWS], \n7 utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this Act by carrying out \n8 programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species.” Id. \n9 § 1536(a)(1). \n10 42.  In  addition  to  this  overarching  mandate,  the  ESA  requires  that \n11 “[e]ach Federal agency shall, in consultation with . . . [FWS], insure that any \n12 action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . .  is not likely to \n13 jeopardize  the  continued  existence  of  any  endangered  species  or  threatened \n14 species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical habitat].” \n15 Id. § 1536(a)(2).  \n16 43.  FWS’ regulations define an agency “action” to mean “all activities or \n17 programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by \n18 Federal agencies.”  50 C.F.R. § 402.02 (2016). \n19 44.  Section 7(a)(2) contains both procedural and substantive mandates.  \n20 Substantively, it requires that all federal agencies avoid actions that: (1) jeopardize \n21 listed  species;  or  (2)  destroy  or  adversely  modify  designated  critical  habitat.  \n22 Procedurally,  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  substantive  standards,  the  federal \n23 agency taking action and FWS take part in a cooperative analysis of potential \n24 impacts  to  listed  species  and  their  designated  critical  habitat  known  as  the \n25 consultation process.  16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).  The consultation process has been \n26 described  as  the  “heart  of  the  ESA.”    Western  Watersheds  Project  v. \n27 Kraayenbrink, 632 F.3d 472, 495 (9th Cir. 2011). \n28 45.  Through the formal Section 7 consultation process, FWS prepares a \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 14                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.111   Page 15 of 50\n1 “biological opinion” as to whether the action is likely to jeopardize the species or \n2 destroy or adversely modify critical habitat and, if so, suggests “reasonable and \n3 prudent alternatives” to avoid that result.  16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(3)(A).  During the \n4 consultation process, both agencies must “use the best scientific and commercial \n5 data available.”  Id. § 1536(a)(2); 50 CFR § 402.14(d). \n6 C.  Freedom of Information Act \n7 46.  FOIA’s basic purpose is government transparency.  It establishes the \n8 public’s right to access all federal agency records unless such records may be \n9 withheld pursuant to one of nine, narrowly construed FOIA exemptions.  5 U.S.C. \n10 § 552(b)(1)-(9). \n11 47.  FOIA imposes strict and rigorous deadlines on federal agencies when \n12 they receive a request for records pursuant to FOIA.  Specifically, an agency must \n13 determine whether to disclose responsive records and notify the requester of its \n14 determination within 20 working days of receiving a FOIA request, and it must \n15 make records “promptly” available, unless it can establish that certain unusual \n16 circumstances are present and/or that it may lawfully withhold records, or portions \n17 thereof, from disclosure.  Id. § 552(a)(3)(A), (a)(6).  Also within 20 working days, \n18 the agency must inform the requester that it has a right to appeal the agency’s \n19 determination.  Id. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).   \n20 48.  FOIA places the burden on the agency to prove that it may withhold \n21 responsive records from a requester.  Id. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n22 49.  Congress  has  specified  limited  circumstances  in  which  federal \n23 agencies may obtain more time to make the determination that is required by 5 \n24 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n25 50.  First,  an  agency  may  toll  the  20-working-day  deadline  to  seek \n26 additional information or clarification from a requester, but that tolling period \n27 ends  when  the  agency  receives  such  information  or  clarification.    Id.  § \n28 552(a)(6)(A). \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 15                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.112   Page 16 of 50\n1 51.  Second, an agency may extend the 20-working-day deadline for an \n2 additional 10 working days by giving a written notice to the requester that sets \n3 forth “unusual circumstances” to justify a deadline extension, which also requires \n4 that it provide the date by which the agency expects to make the determination.  \n5 Id.  §  552(a)(6)(B)(i).    However,  to  invoke  such  “unusual  circumstances,”  the \n6 agency must provide the requester with “an opportunity to limit the scope of the \n7 request so that it may be processed within [20 working days] or an opportunity to \n8 arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a \n9 modified request.”  Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).  In addition, when asserting unusual \n10 circumstances,  the  agency  “shall  make  available  its  FOIA  Public  Liaison”  to \n11 “assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the agency.”  \n12 Id. \n13 52.  FOIA requires each agency to make reasonable efforts to search for \n14 records in a manner that is reasonably calculated to locate all records that are \n15 responsive to the FOIA request.  Id. § 552(a)(3)(C)-(D). \n16 53.  FOIA requires federal agencies to expeditiously disclose requested \n17 records, see id. § 552, and mandates a policy of broad disclosure of government \n18 records.  Any inquiry under FOIA brings with it a strong presumption in favor of \n19 disclosure.   \n20 54.  Congress recognized that in certain, limited instances, records may be \n21 withheld as exempt from FOIA’s broad disclosure mandate, and thus it created \n22 nine categories of exemptions.  Id. § 552(b).  These exemptions, however, are \n23 narrowly  construed  in  light  of  FOIA’s  dominant  objective  of  disclosure,  not \n24 secrecy. \n25 55.  The U.S. district courts have jurisdiction “to enjoin the agency from \n26 withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records \n27 improperly withheld from the complainant.”  Id. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n28 56.  Alternatively, an agency’s response to a FOIA request is subject to \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 16                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.113   Page 17 of 50\n1 judicial review under the APA, which confers a right of judicial review on any \n2 person  who  is  adversely  affected  by  an  agency  action,  5  U.S.C.  §  702,  and \n3 authorizes district courts to compel agency action that is unlawfully withheld or \n4 unreasonably delayed.  Id. § 706(1).  District courts must set aside any agency \n5 action  that  is  found  to  be  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion  or \n6 otherwise not in accordance with law.”  Id. § 706(2)(A).  \n \n7\nD.  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n8   1996 \n57.  Section 102 of the 1996 IIRIRA was the first legislative enactment \n9\nunder which Congress specifically authorized the Attorney General to construct \n10\n“border barriers and roads.”1  P.L. 104-208, div. C., codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 \n11\nnote.  \n12\n58.  Prior to IIRIRA’s enactment, USBP in 1990 (with the assistance of \n13\nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard) began constructing a  \n14\nborder fence in the San Diego region, utilizing Army surplus carbon steel mats \n15\nwhich were used as landing strips during the Vietnam War.  The San Diego border \n16\nfence—the first in history to be constructed along the U.S.-Mexico border (other \n17\nthan chain link)—was  completed in 1993, beginning at the Pacific Ocean and \n18\nrunning approximately 14 miles eastward to the Otay Mesa region.  \n19\n59.  The  1994  Border  Patrol  Strategic  Plan:  1994  and  Beyond, \n20\nemphasized a “prevention through deterrence” strategy under which the agency \n21\n                                                 \n22\n1  Prior  to the  September  11, 2001  terrorist  attacks,  the  Attorney  General  was \n23 vested with the authority over immigration laws.  The Attorney General had, in \nturn,  delegated  that  authority  to  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service \n24\n(“INS”)  and  its  component  agency U.S.  Border  Patrol (“USBP”),  which  were \n25 located within the Department of Justice.  Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act \nof 2002, P.L. 107-296, DHS was created, the INS was abolished, and the INS \n26\nimmigration functions, as well as its component agency USBP, were transferred to \n27 DHS.  Under DHS, USBP became a component of the newly created agency CBP.  \nIIRIRA section 102 was subsequently amended to substitute the DHS Secretary \n28\nfor the Attorney General as having responsibility over border barriers and roads.  \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 17                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.114   Page 18 of 50\n1 significantly increased agent numbers, deployed technological aids such as ground \n2 sensors and surveillance cameras, and proposed extensive construction of border \n3 fences, roads, and other border security infrastructure.   \n4 60.  As  part  of  the  prevention  through  deterrence  strategy,  and  in \n5 recognition  that  Congress  had  never  provided  INS  and  USBP  with  specific \n6 statutory authority to construct border barriers, Congress enacted IIRIRA in 1996. \n7 IIRIRA  section  102,  for  the  first  time,  provided  INS  and  USBP  with  general \n8 authorization to build border barriers, as well as specific direction regarding the \n9 location and extent of specific border barriers to be constructed. \n10 61.  Amended  several  times,  IIRIRA  section  102  remains  the  primary \n11 federal statute addressing border barriers, pursuant to three primary provisions: (i) \n12 section 102(a) (providing general authority to construct border fences and other \n13 border  barriers);  (ii)  section  102(b)  (carrying  out  subsection  (a),  by  providing \n14 specific  mandates  for  border  barrier  construction,  and  the  deadlines  for  such \n15 construction, among other requirements); and (iii) section 102(c) (legal waiver \n16 authority). \n17 62.  IIRIRA  section  102(a),  which  remains  substantively  the  same  as \n18 originally  enacted  in  1996,  provided  the  Attorney  General  (now  the  DHS \n19 Secretary) with the general authority to “take such actions as may be necessary to \n20 install additional physical barriers and roads . . . in the vicinity of the United \n21 States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United \n22 States.” \n23 63.  IIRIRA section 102(b) “carr[ies] out subsection (a)” by identifying \n24 specific border barriers to be constructed, establishing specific deadlines for the \n25 construction of such barriers, and other requirements.  \n26 64.  The only border fence segment initially mandated by Congress under \n27 IIRIRA section 102(b) was the construction of a double and triple layer border \n28 fence to further fortify the 14-mile long San Diego “primary” border fence that \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 18                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.115   Page 19 of 50\n1 was finished in 1993.   \n2 65.   As  originally  enacted,  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  stated  that  the \n3 provisions  of  NEPA  and  the  ESA  “[were]  waived  to  the  extent  the  Attorney \n4 General determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n5 and roads under this section.”  At the time of its enactment, the Department of \n6 Justice and INS opposed IIRIRA section 102(c) and established a policy not to use \n7 the  waiver  authority.    See  March  6,  1997  Memorandum  from  INS  Assistant \n8 Commissioner David Yentzer.  \n9 66.   The  IIRIRA  Section  102(c)  waiver  modifier  “under  this  section” \n10 refers to the specific border fencing required under IIRIRA section 102(b), which \n11 by its plain language “carries out” DHS’s general authority to “install additional \n12 physical  barriers  and  roads”  under  IIRIRA  section  102(a).    At  the  time  of \n13 IIRIRA’s enactment, the specific border fencing directed under IIRIRA section \n14 102(b) was limited to the 14-mile double and triple layer San Diego border fence. \n15 E.  The 2005 REAL ID Act Amendments to IIRIRA Section 102(c)  \n16 67.  Enacted in 2005 as an unrelated legislative rider to the “Emergency \n17 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n18 Tsunami Relief, 2005,” section 102 of the REAL ID Act amended the section \n19 102(c) IIRIRA waiver provision.2   P.L. 109-13, div. B.  Specifically, the REAL \n20 ID Act amendment expanded the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver authority beyond \n21 NEPA and the ESA to permit the DHS Secretary “to waive all legal requirements \n22 such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure \n23 expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.”  \n24\n                                                 \n25 2 It is a potentially confusing coincidence that section 102 of the REAL ID Act \namended  section  102  of  the  IIRIRA.    The  REAL  ID  Act  addressed  border \n26\nsecurity, including the amendment to IIRIRA section 102(c), but its scope was \n27 much broader, consisting of four additional titles addressing: asylum and removal; \ndrivers’  licenses;  H-2B  temporary  worker  provisions;  and  Australian  E \n28\nnonimmigrant and EB-3 nurses visas. \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 19                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.116   Page 20 of 50\n1 68.  In addition, section 102 of the REAL ID Act amended the IIRIRA \n2 section  102(c)  waiver  authority  to  restrict  judicial  review  in  the  following \n3 respects:  purporting  to  limit  “all  causes  or  claims”  arising  from  any  waiver \n4 determination made by the DHS Secretary to alleged constitutional violations; \n5 requiring any such constitutional challenge to be filed not later than 60 days after \n6 the  Secretary’s  determination;  and  eliminating  appellate  court  review  of  the \n7 district  court’s  decision  on  the  alleged  constitutional  violations,  instead  only \n8 permitting review upon a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.   \n9 69.  The  REAL  ID  Act  was  introduced  by  Judiciary  Chairman  James \n10 Sensenbrenner in the House of Representatives on January 26, 2005, and assigned \n11 the bill number H.R. 418.  Despite significant controversy concerning the section \n12 102 waiver provisions and numerous other provisions of H.R. 418, there were no \n13 Committee hearings held on the bill in either Chamber of Congress.   \n14 70.  Two weeks after introduction, H.R. 418 was considered in the full \n15 House on February 9, 2005 (151 Cong. Rec. H453-471) and February 10, 2005 \n16 (151 Cong. Rec. H527-566).  \n17 71.  The REAL ID Act was never specifically considered in the Senate, as \n18 it  was  added  to  the  Emergency  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act  during \n19 conference committee.  As stated by one Senator, the bill “was simply grafted \n20 onto the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that provides funding for our \n21 military  operations  and  our  troops,  without  debate  or  participation  by  the \n22 conferees.”    151  Cong.

Congress intended the REAL ID Act’s amendment and expansion of \n25 that 102(c) waiver authority, like the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver authority as \n26 originally  enacted  in  1996,  to  apply  to  the  specific  border  barrier  and  road \n27 requirements  at  IIRIRA  section  102(b),  which  carries  out  the  general  border \n28 barrier authority at IIRIRA section 102(a).  At that time, the only specific border \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 20                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.117   Page 21 of 50\n1 barriers required under section 102(b) remained the 14-mile San Diego double and \n2 triple layer fence proposals.  \n3 73.  Congress’s intent that the expansion of the IIRIRA section 102(c) \n4 waiver authority under section 102 of the REAL ID Act continue to be limited to \n5 the specific border barriers mandated by IIRIRA section 102(b) is evidenced by \n6 the bill’s plain language, as well as statements by the bill’s author and co-sponsors \n7 during the limited House Floor debate.   \n8 74.  Indeed, the bill’s official title made clear that Congress’s intent in \n9 expanding the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver authority was specific to the border \n10 barrier  segments  identified  under  section  102(b):  “To  establish  and  rapidly \n11 implement  regulations  for  State  driver’s  license  and  identification  document \n12 security  standards,  to  prevent  terrorists  from  abusing  the  asylum  laws  of  the \n13 United States, to unify terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and removal, \n14 and to ensure expeditious construction of the San Diego border fence.” (emphasis \n15 added).  \n16 75.  The  intended  limitation  of  the  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  waiver \n17 authority to the San Diego double and triple layered fence specified under IIRIRA \n18 section 102(b) was also repeatedly emphasized by the bill’s supporters on the \n19 House Floor.  As stated by the bill’s author: \n \n20\n[T]he REAL ID Act will waive Federal laws to the extent \nnecessary  to  complete  gaps  in  the  San  Diego  border \n21\nsecurity  fence,  which  is  still  stymied  8  years  after \n22 congressional authorization.   \n \n23  \n24 151  Cong.

The  2006  Secure  Fence  Act  Amendments  to  IIRIRA  Section \n3   102(b) \n4 76.  President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act on October \n5 26, 2016. P.L. 109-367.  \n6 77.  Section 3 of the Secure Fence Act (“Construction of Fencing and \n7 Security Improvements in Border Area from Pacific Ocean to Gulf of Mexico”) \n8 significantly expanded upon IIRIRA section 102(b) and its previous sole focus on \n9 the 14-mile San Diego double and triple layer fence construction.  Under the \n10 Secure Fence Act amendments to IIRIRA section 102(b), Congress directed DHS \n11 to “provide for at least 2 layers of reinforced fencing [and] the installation of \n12 additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors” in five specific \n13 segments  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  totaling  approximately  850  miles.  \n14 IIRIRA,  former  §102(b)(1)(A)(i)-(v).  The  required  border  barrier  construction \n15 included one California segment, two Texas segments, one segment encompassing \n16 portions of both California and Arizona, and one segment encompassing portions \n17 of both New Mexico and Texas.    \n18 78.  Section 3 further amended IIRIRA section 102(b) to add the specific \n19 requirement  that  two  of  these  segments  be  considered  “priority  areas,”  with \n20 construction deadlines of May 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008.  Former IIRIRA \n21 § 102(b)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).3  \n22 79.  Congress did not specifically consider the impact of the Secure Fence \n23 Act amendments on the scope of the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver. \n \n24\n                                                 \n25 3 In addition to its IIRIRA amendments, the Secure Fence Act directed the DHS \nSecretary  to  achieve  and  maintain  operational  control  over  the  borders  of  the \n26\nUnited States [including the northern and coastal borders] through surveillance \n27 activities and physical infrastructure enhancements to prevent unlawful entry and \nfacilitate CBP’s access to the borders.

The 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act Amendments to  IIRIRA \n2 Section 102(b) \n3 80.  Just over a year after enactment of the Secure Fence Act, President \n4 George W. Bush signed the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act on December \n5 26, 2007.  P.L. 110-161, div. E. \n6 81.  Section  564  of  the  2008  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  again \n7 amended section 102(b) of the IIRIRA to scale back DHS’s duties with respect to \n8 border  barriers  and  roads  as  defined  under  the  2006  Secure  Fence  Act \n9 amendments.  These modifications—which remain the law today—include: (1) \n10 eliminating the requirement that border barriers be built in any specific locations, \n11 and instead specifying that such barriers be placed “along not less than 700 miles \n12 of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective”; (2) \n13 eliminating  the  requirement  of  double-layered  fencing;  and  (3)  amending  the \n14 “priority areas” requirement to direct that DHS identify and construct 370 miles of \n15 border barriers by December 31, 2008.  IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A)-(B).  \n16 82.  The  2008  Appropriations  Act  also  added  a  new  consultation \n17 requirement to IIRIRA section 102(b), directing that DHS “shall consult with the \n18 Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, States, local governments, \n19 Indian tribes, and property owners in the United States to minimize the impact on \n20 the environment, culture, commerce, and quality of life for the communities and \n21 residents located near the sites where” border barriers are constructed.  IIRIRA § \n22 102(b)(1)(C). \n23 FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n24\nA.  Past Construction of Border Barriers and Use of the Waiver Authority \n25 Under IIRIRA \n26 83.  Enabled by billions of dollars in Congressional appropriations, and in \n27 response to IIRIRA’s amendments by the 2005 REAL ID Act, 2006 Secure Fence \n28 Act, and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, DHS has greatly increased the \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 23                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.120   Page 24 of 50\n1 extent of border barriers and roads along the U.S.-Mexico border.   \n2 84.  In order to facilitate this extensive construction, during the George \n3 W. Bush Administration’s second term, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff \n4 published five “notices of determination” in the Federal Register that he was \n5 invoking the IIRIRA Section 102(c) authority to waive in their entirety a total of \n6 more than 35 laws that would have otherwise applied to construction of border \n7 fencing and roads.  These waivers applied to border barrier and road construction \n8 in the following areas: (i) San Diego, 70 Fed. Reg. 55,622 (Sept. 22, 2005)(13.9 \n9 miles); (ii) Barry M. Goldwater Range, Arizona, 72 Fed. Reg. 2,535 (Jan. 19, \n10 2007)(37.3  miles);  (iii)  San  Pedro  Riparian  National  Conservation  Area \n11 (administered  by  U.S.  Bureau  of  Land  Management),  Arizona,  72  Fed.  Reg. \n12 60,870  (Oct.  26,  2007)(5.5  miles);  (iv)  Hidalgo  County,  Texas,  73  Fed.  Reg. \n13 19,077 (April 3, 2008)(corrected on April 8, 2008)(21 miles); (v)  Various Areas \n14 in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, 73 Fed. Reg. 18,293 (April 3, \n15 2008)(546.5 miles).   \n16 85.  In all five of these determinations, the former DHS Secretary waived \n17 application of NEPA and the ESA. In addition to these laws, the former DHS \n18 Secretary waived application of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.; \n19 National Historic Preservation Act, Pub. Law 89-665; Migratory Bird Treaty Act, \n20 16 U.S.C. § 703 et seq.; Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.; Archeological \n21 Resources Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. § 470aa et seq.; Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 \n22 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.; Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1281 et seq.; \n23 Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1131 et seq.; National Forest Management Act, 16 \n24 U.S.C. § 1600 et seq.; Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, \n25 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb;  and American Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1996, as \n26 well as numerous additional laws.  \n27 86.  Collectively,  the  five  REAL  ID  Determinations  waived  laws  that \n28 otherwise would have applied to approximately 624.5 miles of border barrier and \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 24                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.121   Page 25 of 50\n1 road construction.   \n2 87.  Clearly, DHS has taken aggressive action to comply with Congress’s \n3 IIRIRA mandates, including the repeated use by former DHS Secretary Chertoff \n4 of the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver to “ensure expeditious construction” of the \n5 specific barriers and roads mandated by IIRIRA section 102(b), which have been \n6 identified  by  Congress  as  necessary  to  carry  out  DHS’s  general  authority  to \n7 construct border barriers and roads necessary to deter illegal crossing in areas of \n8 high illegal entry into the United States under IIRIRA section 102(a).   \n9 88.  Consequently, DHS has met its statutory responsibilities to construct \n10 the  specific  “fencing  and  road  improvements  along  the  border”  as  currently \n11 defined by IIRIRA section 102(b).  \n12 89.  As of February 2017, DHS has constructed 654 miles of “primary” \n13 border barriers and approximately 5,000 miles of roads along the U.S.-Mexico \n14 border.  See “Southwest border security: Additional actions needed to better assess \n15 fencing’s  contributions  to  operations  and  provide  guidance  for  identifying \n16 capability gaps.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) Report 17-\n17 331, a report to congressional requesters (February 2017).   \n18 90.  DHS has met its specific mandate to identify and construct 370 miles \n19 of border fencing in “priority areas . . . where fencing would be most practical and \n20 effective.”  IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(B).   \n21 91.  DHS  has  also  met  its  specific  mandate  to  “construct  reinforced \n22 fencing  along  not  less  than  700  miles  of  the  southwest  border  where  fencing \n23 would be most practical and effective.”  IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A).  In addition to the \n24 654 miles of primary fencing constructed by DHS, the agency has constructed an \n25 additional  37  miles  of  double-layered  fencing  and  14  miles  of  triple-layered \n26 fencing.  In total, DHS has deployed a total of 705 miles of reinforced border \n27 fencing, exceeding the 700-mile minimum under IIRIRA section 102(b)(1)(A).   \n28 92.  As summarized recently by the GAO: \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 25                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.122   Page 26 of 50\n \n1\nFrom fiscal years 2005 through 2015, CBP increased the \ntotal miles of primary border fencing on the southwest \n2\nborder from 119 miles to 654 miles—including 354 miles \nof primary pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of primary \n3\nvehicle  fencing.    With  654  miles  of  primary  fencing \ncurrently deployed, CBP officials have stated that CBP is \n4\nin  compliance  with  its  legal  requirements  for  the \n5 construction  of  the  southwest  border  fencing  on  the \nsubstantial  discretion  provided  to  the  Secretary  of \n6 Homeland  Security  to  determine  the  appropriate \nplacement of fencing. \n7  \n8 GAO Report, at p. 8. \n \n9\nB.  January  25,  2017  Executive  Order  13767  (“Border  Security  and \n10   Immigration Enforcement Improvement”) \n11 93.  On January 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive \n12 Order  No.  13767,  entitled  “Border  Security  and  Immigration  Enforcement \n13 Improvement” (“Executive Order”), which directed DHS to construct a “secure, \n14 contiguous, and impassable physical barrier” along the entirety of the nearly 2,000 \n15 mile-long U.S.-Mexico border.  The Executive Order defined “wall” to mean “a \n16 contiguous, physical wall or similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical \n17 barrier.”   \n18 94.  On February 17, 2017, former DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a \n19 memorandum  regarding  “Implementing  the  President’s  Border  Security  and \n20 Immigration  Enforcement  Improvements  Policies”  (“Kelly  Memorandum”), \n21 which directed CBP to “immediately begin planning, design, construction, and \n22 maintenance  of  a  wall,  including  the  attendant  lighting,  technology  (including \n23 sensors), as well as patrol and access roads, along the land border with Mexico in \n24 accordance with existing law . . . .”  Further, the Kelly Memorandum directed the \n25 DHS Undersecretary for Management, in consultation with CBP, to “immediately \n26 identify and allocate all sources of available funding for the planning, design, \n27 construction, and maintenance of a wall . . . .” \n28  \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 26                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.123   Page 27 of 50\n1 C.  Border Wall Prototype Project \n2 95.  In accordance with the Executive Order and the Kelly Memorandum, \n3 on March 17, 2017, DHS released two Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”)—one for \n4 a “Solid Concrete Border Wall Prototype” and the second for an “Other Border \n5 Wall  Prototype.”    The  “threshold  requirements”  for  the  two  prototypes  are \n6 identical, with the exception that the “other border wall prototype” does not have \n7 to be constructed of “reinforced concrete.”  These contractual thresholds include \n8 requirements that the wall design “shall be physically imposing in height.” The \n9 government’s “nominal concept is for a 30-foot high wall,” and designs “with \n10 heights of less than 18 feet are not acceptable.”  The RFPs further specify that the \n11 wall designs “shall prevent digging or tunneling below it for a minimum of 6 feet \n12 below  the  lowest  adjacent  grade,”  “shall  be  constructible  to  slopes  up  to  45 \n13 percent,” and shall be built in a manner that it would take at least an hour to \n14 breach with a “sledgehammer, car jack, pickaxe, chisel, battery operated impact \n15 tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-\n16 held tools.”   \n17 96.  The 30-foot border wall envisioned under the Executive Order and  \n18 called for under the RFP’s would significantly differ from existing border fencing \n19 and  other  border  barriers  with  respect  to  height,  construction  materials,  and \n20 permeability, and would pose distinct and additive environmental risks and harms.  \n21 97.  Phase I of the RFPs required bidders to submit Concept Papers by \n22 April 4, 2017.  Up to 20 bidders from Phase I could be invited to contract for \n23 participation in Phase II of the bidding process.  \n24 98.  Phase  II  requires  the  Contractors  to  “provide  for  the  design  and \n25 construction of a full-scale prototype, which shall be 30 feet long, and “will be \n26 constructed at a location in San Diego, CA as determined by the Government.”  \n27 99.  The border wall prototype project will be constructed on federally-\n28 owned land in San Diego, California, within the vicinity of Otay Mesa near the \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 27                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.124   Page 28 of 50\n1 base  of  the  Otay  Mountain  Wilderness  and  the  eastern  terminus  of  existing \n2 secondary fencing within the approximately 14-mile long, westernmost segment \n3 of the current border fence beginning at the Pacific Ocean.  \n4 100.  The Otay Mesa area, where the border wall prototype project will \n5 take  place,  is  of  high  environmental  and  natural  resources  value.    It  contains \n6 several vernal pools—one of the most imperiled wildlife habitats in San Diego \n7 County—and  designated  critical  habitat  for  numerous  listed  threatened  and \n8 endangered  species,  including  the  Quino  checkerspot  butterfly  and  San  Diego \n9 fairy shrimp, as well as habitat for non-listed sensitive and rare species, such as \n10 the burrowing owl.   \n11 101.  On  August  31,  2017,  Acting  CBP  Deputy  Commissioner  Ronald \n12 Vitiello held a press briefing in which he announced that CBP had chosen four \n13 vendors to construct the “Solid Concrete Wall” prototypes, and that the agency \n14 would announce four additional vendors to construct the “Other Border Wall” \n15 prototypes at a later date. \n16 D.  San Diego County Border Wall Replacement Project \n17 102.  In addition to the border wall prototype project, Federal Defendants \n18 are implementing the Executive Order and the Kelly Memorandum through the \n19 proposed construction of a border wall to replace the existing 14-mile primary and \n20 secondary fencing in San Diego County.  This construction has been described by \n21 Federal Defendants in various pronouncements and agency documents, including \n22 the March 2017 document, entitled “Building The Wall: The Strategy & Way \n23 Forward” (“Wall Strategy Document”), and the August 2, 2017 IIRIRA section \n24 102(c) determination by former DHS Secretary Kelly \n25 103.  The 14-mile San Diego border wall replacement project will likely \n26 impact  numerous  ESA-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species,  and  their \n27 designated critical habitat, including the arroyo toad, the California least tern, and \n28 the Southwestern willow flycatcher.  The proposed 30-foot high replacement wall \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 28                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.125   Page 29 of 50\n1 is notably higher than the existing border fencing, and may be constructed of \n2 impermeable concrete, both of which would exacerbate environmental impacts of \n3 the existing border fencing.  \n4 104.  Even though this region has already been heavily impacted by prior \n5 border fence  construction and other activities and infrastructure, the border wall \n6 replacement  project  is  a  major  construction  project  that  poses  significant \n7 additional threats to aquatic resources and other rare wildlife habitats, as well as \n8 the numerous endangered species and imperiled habitats that lie within the path of \n9 the wall.  Some of these impacts could likely be avoided or mitigated by prior \n10 compliance with NEPA, the ESA, and other laws. \n11 105.  Federal Defendants have failed to comply with NEPA, the ESA, or \n12 other environmental laws for the border wall prototype project and border wall \n13 replacement project.  Federal Defendants have also failed to fulfill their IIRIRA \n14 Section 102(b)(1)(C) consultation requirements.  \n15 106.  As a consequence of Federal Defendants’ failure to provide for any \n16 public participation or consultation in their consideration and authorization of the \n17 border wall prototype project and border wall replacement project, the Center and \n18 other members of the public did not have any opportunity to obtain information \n19 about or provide input prior to approval of those projects. \n20\nE.  Prior IIRIRA Section 102(c) Waivers Are Inapplicable to the Border \n21   Wall Prototype Project and Border Wall Replacement Project \n22 107.  Former  DHS  Secretary  Chertoff’s  first  use  of  the  IIRIRA  section \n23 102(c) waiver authority applied to the 14-mile border fence  segment that would \n24 be replaced under the border wall replacement project.  70 Fed. Reg. 55,622 (Sept. \n25 22, 2005).  As stated in that notice, former Secretary Chertoff determined that it \n26 was necessary to waive NEPA, ESA, and several other laws “with respect to the \n27 construction of the barriers and roads” associated with the 14-mile border fence. \n28 108.  As reflected in the language of the notice, the 2005 waiver applied to \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 29                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.126   Page 30 of 50\n1 the initial construction of the 14-mile border fence, not the border wall prototype \n2 project and border wall replacement project now proposed.  The 2005 waiver \n3 cannot reasonably be interpreted to exempt compliance with the waived laws in \n4 perpetuity for subsequent work to maintain or repair the existing 14-mile border \n5 fence, or the construction of border wall prototypes, even if the footprint for those \n6 projects falls within the geographical boundaries of the 2005 waiver.  \n7 F.  The August 2, 2017 IIRIRA Section 102(c) Waiver \n8 109.   On  August  2,  2017,  former  DHS  Secretary  John  Kelly  issued  a \n9 Determination in the Federal Register purporting to invoke IIRIRA section 102(c) \n10 in order to waive the application of NEPA, the ESA, and more than 30 additional \n11 laws not at issue in this lawsuit to “various border infrastructure projects” in the \n12 “project area,” which is defined as “an approximately fifteen mile segment of the \n13 border within the San Diego Sector that starts at the Pacific Ocean and extends \n14 eastward,” starting at “the Pacific Ocean and extending to approximately one mile \n15 east of Border Monument 251.” 82 Fed.

In response to Federal Defendants’ failure and/or refusal to provide \n24\nthe  Center  or  public  generally  with  information  regarding  NEPA  and  other \n25\nenvironmental compliance in relation to the border wall prototype project, on May \n26\n2, 2017, the Center submitted via email a FOIA request to DHS for the following \n27\ninformation:  \n28\n \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 31                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.128   Page 32 of 50\n \n1 1.

In  response,  on  May  2,  2017,  DHS  acknowledged  the  Center’s \n12 request  and  assigned  it  tracking  number  2017-HQFO-00717  (“the  DHS  FOIA \n13 Request”).  DHS also invoked a 10-working-day extension pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § \n14 552(a)(6)(B)(i)  due  to  DHS’s  claim  that  the  DHS  FOIA  Request  “seeks \n15 documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search.”  \n16 114.  A determination on the DHS FOIA Request was due by June 14, \n17 2017, which is 30 working days after DHS’s acknowledgement of the DHS FOIA \n18 Request. \n19 115.  As of the date of the filing of this second amended complaint, which \n20 is past the 30-working-day deadline, DHS has not requested additional time to \n21 respond, provided any responsive records, or provided a determination in response \n22 to the DHS FOIA Request. \n23 116.

In  response,  on  May  2,  2017,  CBP  acknowledged  the  Center’s \n10 request and assigned it the tracking number CBP-2017-053692 (“the CBP FOIA \n11 Request”).  On May 3, 2017, CBP sent the Center an automated notice stating that \n12 the “average time to process a FOIA request related to ‘travel/border incidents’ is \n13 a minimum of 3-6 months.”  The notice failed to provide any completion date by \n14 which CBP is to provide the requested records.   \n15 119.  A determination on the CBP FOIA Request was due by May 31, \n16 2017, which is 20 working days after CBP’s acknowledgement of the CBP FOIA \n17 Request. \n18 120.

Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  in  all  preceding \n6 paragraphs.  \n7 123.  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  provides  the  DHS  Secretary  with  “the \n8 authority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole \n9 discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n10 and roads under this section.” \n11 124.  The scope of the IIRIRA section 102(c) authority granted to the DHS \n12 Secretary  to  waive  laws  “under  this  section”  is  limited  to  the  specific  border \n13 barriers and roads required to be constructed pursuant to IIRIRA section 102(b).  \n14 IIRIRA  section  102(a)  provides  general  authority  to  DHS  to  construct  border \n15 barriers  and  roads  in  areas  of  high  illegal  entry  into  the  United  States,  while \n16 IIRIRA section 102(b) identifies the specific “construction of fencing and road \n17 improvements along the border” necessary to “carry[] out subsection(a).”   \n18 125.  At the time of the original 1996 enactment of IIRIRA, as well as its \n19 2005 amendment by section 102 of the REAL ID Act, the specific border barrier \n20 construction required under IIRIRA section 102(b) was limited to the San Diego \n21 14-mile double and triple layer border fence.   \n22 126.  Congress  subsequently  amended  IIRIRA  section  102(b)  under  the \n23 2006 Secure Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  The 2006 \n24 Secure Fence Act amended IIRIRA section 102(b) to require DHS to construct \n25 five specific segments of double-layered border fencing totaling approximately \n26 850  miles.    A  year  later,  with  the  enactment  of  the  2008  Consolidated \n27 Appropriations Act, Congress again amended IIRIRA section 102(b) to its current \n28 version,  which  requires  that  DHS  identify  and  construct  370  miles  of  border \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 34                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.131   Page 35 of 50\n1 barriers  by  December  31,  2008,  and  that  the  agency  construct  border  barriers \n2 “along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be \n3 most practical and effective.”   \n4 127.  Congress has not amended the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver since \n5 the 2005 REAL ID Act amendments, and did not discuss or consider the scope of \n6 the waiver during its deliberations or discuss how the existing 102(c) waiver \n7 authority would apply to the expanded scope of IIRIRA section 102(b) under the \n8 2006 Secure Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act amendments.   \n9 128.  Nonetheless, former DHS Secretary Chertoff invoked IIRIRA section \n10 102(c) on five occasions to waive laws on the vast majority of the specific border \n11 barriers required under IIRIRA section 102(b) pursuant to Secure Fence Act and \n12 2008 Appropriations Act amendments.   \n13 129.  Former Secretary Chertoff’s expansion of the IIRIRA section 102(c) \n14 waiver authority beyond the San Diego double and triple layer fence proposal \n15 that was included in the original IIRIRA section 102(b) was not contested in \n16 previous litigation concerning the five waivers issued by the former Secretary. \n17 No  court  addressed  whether  the  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  waiver  authority  was \n18 properly applied by former Secretary Chertoff to the greatly expanded scope of \n19 IIRIRA  section  102(b)  under  the  2005 REAL  ID  Act  amendments  and  2008 \n20 Consolidated Appropriations Act amendments. \n21 130.  Even presuming that the section 102(c) waiver authority is applicable \n22 to the expansion of 102(b) specific border barrier mandates beyond the double \n23 and triple layer San Diego fence, DHS has now fulfilled its requirements under \n24 that subsection.   \n25 131.  Specifically,  DHS  has  met  its  duty  to  identify  and  construct  370 \n26 miles of border barriers within “priority areas” by December 31, 2008 as required \n27 by IIRIRA section 102(b)(1)(B), as well as its duty to construct a total of not less \n28 than 700 miles of border barriers as required by IIRIRA section 102(b)(1)(A).  \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 35                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.132   Page 36 of 50\n1 132.  Because the scope of the IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver is limited to \n2 the border barriers and road requirements specified by IIRIRA section 102(b), the \n3 requirements  of  which  have  already  been  fulfilled,  the  purported  waiver  of \n4 NEPA, the ESA, the APA, and more than 30 additional laws under Secretary \n5 Kelly’s August 2, 2017 Determination pursuant to IIRIRA section 102(c) is an \n6 unlawful ultra vires act subject to review by this Court, and the restrictions on \n7 judicial review and appellate review under that subsection are inapplicable to that \n8 determination.   \n9 133.   Even in the event that the Court finds the IIRIRA section 102(c) \n10 waiver  authority  is  not  limited  to  the  border  barriers  and  road  requirements \n11 specified  by  IIRIRA  section  102(b),  the  purported  waiver  of  laws  under  the \n12 August 2, 2017 IIRIRA section 102(c) Determination is nonetheless an unlawful \n13 ultra vires act subject to review by this Court for at least three additional reasons. \n14 134.  First,  the  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  waiver  authority,  by  its  plain \n15 language, was intended to apply to the initial construction of border barriers, not \n16 the border wall replacement or the border wall prototype projects at issue in this \n17 litigation. \n18 135.  Second, the purported waiver of laws by former DHS Secretary Kelly \n19 under  the  August  2,  2017  Determination  does  not  contain  any  rationale \n20 demonstrating that the “approximately fifteen mile segment” of the San Diego \n21 border subject to the purported waiver is necessary to “deter illegal crossings in \n22 areas of high illegal entry into the United States,” as required by the general \n23 border  barrier  and  road  authorization  at  IIRIRA  section  102(a).  Indeed,  the \n24 Determination does not contain any Findings specific to the fifteen mile segment \n25 of waived laws, but instead states in conclusory and circular fashion that the \n26 overall San Diego Sector “remains an area of high illegal entry.”  82 Fed. Reg. at \n27 35,985. \n28 136.  If the San Diego border region at issue in the purported waiver does \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 36                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.133   Page 37 of 50\n1 indeed qualify as “an area of high illegal entry,” such a Finding would call the \n2 entire  DHS  border  fencing  and  prevention  through  deterrence  strategy  into \n3 question, as DHS has expended more resources and constructed more intensive \n4 border barriers in this region than any other along the U.S.-Mexico border, and \n5 has  already  utilized  the  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  waiver  authority  to  finish \n6 construction on the existing San Diego double and triple layer border fence.  70 \n7 Fed. Reg. 55,622 (Sept. 22, 2005). \n8 137.  Third, the purported waiver of laws by former DHS Secretary Kelly \n9 under the August 2, 2017 Determination cannot have been necessary to ensure \n10 the “expeditious” construction of the border wall prototype project and border \n11 wall replacement project at issue in this litigation.   \n12 138.  The IIRIRA section 102(c) waiver authority was enacted in 1996, and \n13 then significantly expanded by the 2005 REAL ID Act amendment.  The IIRIRA \n14 section 102(c) waiver authority has not been further amended by Congress in the \n15 12  years  since  its  2005  consideration  and  enactment,  despite  the  extensive \n16 amendments to IIRIRA section 102(b) by the 2006 Secure Fence Act and 2008 \n17 Consolidated Appropriations Act.   \n18 139.  The  plain  meaning  of  broadly  allowing  the  waiver  of  any  laws \n19 determined  by  the  DHS  Secretary  as  necessary  to  ensure  the  “expeditious \n20 construction” under IIRIRA section 102(c) was to provide the DHS Secretary \n21 with the authority to waive laws in order to build border barriers as soon as \n22 possible after the law’s enactment (i.e. the 2005 REAL ID Act amendment).  \n23 This interpretation is further supported by Congress’s subsequent establishment \n24 of specific deadlines in its amendments to IIRIRA section 102(b) under the 2006 \n25 Secure Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act; most notably, its \n26 direction that at least 370 miles of border barriers be constructed by December \n27 31, 2008, and its explicit termination of the Secretary’s authority to designate \n28 “priority areas” for such construction by that same date.  IIRIRA § 102(b)(2)(A)-\nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 37                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.134   Page 38 of 50\n1 (B).  \n2 140.  The purported August 2, 2017 waiver of laws under former DHS \n3 Secretary Kelly could only be lawful if the term “expeditious” was construed to \n4 permit DHS to apply such waivers in perpetuity, long after the deadlines set by \n5 the  statute  for  the  construction  of  any  such  barriers,  and  in  relation  to  the \n6 construction of additional barriers that have not been specifically directed by \n7 Congress.  \n8 141.  Due to fact that the border wall prototype project and border wall \n9 replacement project are not subject to the scope of the IIRIRA section 102(c) \n10 waiver authority, former DHS Secretary Kelly’s purported waiver of laws under \n11 the August 2, 2017 Determination is an unlawful ultra vires act subject to review \n12 by this Court, and the restrictions on judicial review and appellate review under \n13 that subsection are inapplicable to that determination. \n14  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15\nConstitutional Violation  \n16 Violation of the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution  \nArticle II, Section 3 \n17\n(August 2, 2017 IIRIRA Section 102(c) Determination) \n18  \n19 142.

Under  IIRIRA  section  102(c),  and  subject  to  the  ultra  vires \n22 restrictions  described  in  the  First  Claim  for  Relief,  once  the  DHS  Secretary \n23 invokes the waiver authority, the “only cause or claim” that may be brought \n24 arising from the waiver is one “alleging a violation of the Constitution of the \n25 United States.”  IIRIRA section 102(c) further  provides that “[t]he district courts \n26 of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims \n27 arising from any” such action, which “shall be filed not later than 60 days after \n28 the date of action or decision” at issue.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A)-(C). \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 38                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.135   Page 39 of 50\n1 144.  Article  II  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  provides  that  “The  executive \n2 Power shall be vested in a President,” and that he or she “shall take Care that the \n3 Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Constitution Article II, § 3. \n4 145.  Among  the  laws  the  Take  Care  Clause  mandates  be  “faithfully \n5 executed” are NEPA and the ESA, as well as the conditions and limitations of \n6 IIRIRA  section  102  itself.    Among  the  conditions  and  limitations  of  IIRIRA \n7 section 102 are the limitations of barrier construction to areas of “high illegal \n8 entry” under subsection (a), the geographical and temporal restrictions for such \n9 construction, along with the requirements for consultation with affected entities \n10 under subsection (b), and the restriction on waiver authority under subsection (c) \n11 to the “expeditious construction of the barriers and roads” otherwise authorized \n12 by the statute.   \n13 146.  DHS  Secretary  Kelly’s  purported  waiver  of  NEPA,  the  ESA,  the \n14 APA, and more than 30 additional laws under the August 2, 2017 Determination \n15 failed to comply with the laws that the Executive Branch is required to “faithfully \n16 execute.” \n \n17\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18 Constitutional Violation \nViolation of the Separation of Powers of the U.S. Constitution \n19\n (IIRIRA Section 102(c) and  \n20 August 2, 2017 IIRIRA Section 102(c) Determination) \n \n21  \n22 147.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  in  all  preceding \n23 paragraphs.  \n24 148.  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  United  States  Constitution  directs  that \n25 “[a]ll  legislative  Powers  herein  granted  shall  be  vested  in  a  Congress  of  the \n26 United States.”   \n27 149.  Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution directs that “[t]he executive \n28 Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 39                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.136   Page 40 of 50\n1 150.  Under  these  constitutional  provisions,  Congress  may  not  delegate \n2 legislative authority to an executive branch agency, or in the case of IIRIRA \n3 section 102(c), may not delegate legislative authority to an individual executive \n4 branch official.  \n5 151.  IIRIRA section 102(c) unconstitutionally delegates legislative powers \n6 to  the  DHS  Secretary,  an  executive  branch  official,  and  unconstitutionally \n7 purports to exempt the Executive Branch from complying with its constitutional \n8 obligation to faithfully execute the laws.  \n9 152.  Former DHS Secretary John Kelly’s purported waiver of NEPA, the \n10 ESA, the APA, and more than 30 other laws in relation to “border infrastructure \n11 projects” within “an approximately fifteen mile segment” of the border within \n12 San Diego, 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984 (Aug. 2, 2017) is an unconstitutional exercise of \n13 legislative power by an executive branch official, and consequently violates the \n14 U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers and non-delegation requirements.  \n15  \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n16\nConstitutional Violation \nViolation of the Presentment Clause of the U.S. Constitution \n17\nArticle I, Section 7 \n(IIRIRA Section 102(c) and the  \n18\nAugust 2, 2017 IIRIRA Section 102(c) Determination) \n19  \n20 153.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  in  all  preceding \n21 paragraphs.  \n22 154.  Article I, § 7 of the Constitution provides that any federal statute \n23 must pass both houses of Congress, and “before it become a Law, be presented to \n24 the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall \n25 return it, with his Objections to that House it which it shall have originated, who \n26 shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.”   \n27 155.  The “[a]mendment and repeal of statutes, no less than enactment,” \n28 must conform with the presentment and bicameralism requirements of Article I.  \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 40                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.137   Page 41 of 50\n1 INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 954 (1983). \n2 156.  The August 2, 2017 Determination by former DHS Secretary Kelly \n3 purported to waive NEPA, the ESA, the APA, and more than 30 other laws that \n4 would otherwise apply to border infrastructure projects, including the border wall \n5 prototype project and border wall replacement project at issue in this litigation. \n6 157.  The  IIRIRA  section  102(c)  waiver  authority  and  former  DHS \n7 Secretary  Kelly’s  August  2,  2017  Determination  are  unconstitutional \n8 infringements upon the lawmaking procedures required under Article I, § 7 of the \n9 Constitution.   \n10  \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n11\nNEPA Violations  \n12 (Border Wall Prototype Project and Border Wall Replacement Project)  \n13 158.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  in  all  preceding \n14 paragraphs. \n15 159.  Federal Defendants are required to prepare an environmental impact \n16 statement (“EIS”) on major Federal actions “significantly affecting the quality of \n17 the human environment.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizen Council, 490 U.S. \n18 332, 348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2)(C).  A federal agency “bears the primary \n19 responsibility to ensure that it complies with NEPA.”  ‘Ilio’Ulaokalani Coalition \n20 v. Rumsfeld, 464 F.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir. 2006).  “When an agency decides to \n21 proceed  with  an  action  in  the  absence  of  an  EA  or  EIS,  the  agency  must \n22 adequately explain its decision.”  Alaska Ctr. for Environment v. U.S. Forest \n23 Service, 189 F.3d 851, 859 (9th Cir. 1999).  \n24 160.  Federal Defendants have violated NEPA and NEPA’s implementing \n25 regulations  by  authorizing  the  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall \n26 replacement  project  without  first  conducting  the  necessary  environmental \n27 analysis of the impacts of the projects in an EA or EIS in light of the potentially \n28 significant impacts  that each of the two projects will have.   \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 41                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.138   Page 42 of 50\n1 161.  Federal  Defendants  have  further  violated  NEPA  and  NEPA’s \n2 implementing regulations by failing to initiate and complete NEPA at the earliest \n3 possible time in the planning process.  \n4 162.  Federal  Defendants’  failure  and/or  refusal  to  conduct  NEPA  is \n5 inconsistent with provisions of the DHS NEPA Manual, including provisions \n6 requiring preparation of at least an EA when a proposed project may impact \n7 important environmental resources, and directing that NEPA shall be applied as \n8 early as possible in the planning process.    \n9 163.  Federal  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  any  explanation  or \n10 reasoning  for  the  failure  to  conduct  any  NEPA  analysis  for  the  border  wall \n11 prototype project or border wall replacement project.  This lack of explanation \n12 renders it impossible to determine if Federal Defendants have taken a “hard look” \n13 at the potential environmental consequences of the border wall prototype project \n14 or border wall replacement project, in violation of NEPA. \n15 164.  Federal Defendants’ failure and/or refusal to prepare NEPA analysis \n16 for the border wall prototype project or border wall replacement project also \n17 renders it impossible for the Agencies to avoid and/or mitigate environmental \n18 impacts that would otherwise likely be identified through the NEPA process, in \n19 violation of NEPA. \n20 165.  NEPA requires that the Agencies involve the public in preparing and \n21 considering  environmental  documents  that  implement  the  Act.    40  C.F.R.  § \n22 1506.6 (1978); id. § 1506.6(b)(1) (requiring federal agencies to “[p]rovide public \n23 notice  of  NEPA-related  hearings,  public  meetings,  and  the  availability  of \n24 environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be \n25 interested or affected”).    \n26 166.  Federal Defendants have utterly failed and/or refused to involve the \n27 public in its decision-making processes for the border wall prototype project and \n28 border wall replacement project.  Federal Defendants’ failure to provide for any \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 42                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.139   Page 43 of 50\n1 public participation in relation to their approval of the border wall prototype \n2 project and border wall replacement project violates NEPA and its implementing \n3 regulations.   \n4 167.  The  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall  replacement \n5 project decisions are therefore arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, \n6 not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by \n7 law, and are subject to judicial review pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–\n8 704. \n9  \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10\nESA Violations \n(Border Wall Prototype Project and Border Wall Replacement Project)  \n11\n \n12  \n168.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  in  all  preceding \n13\nparagraphs.  \n14\n169.  Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that “[e]ach Federal agency shall, \n15\nin consultation with . . . [FWS], insure that any action authorized, funded, or \n16\ncarried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence \n17\nof any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or \n18\nadverse modification of [critical habitat].”  Id. § 1536(a)(2).  \n19\n170.  FWS’s regulations define an agency “action” to mean “all activities \n20\nor programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by \n21\nFederal agencies.”  50 C.F.R. § 402.02. \n22\n171.  The  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall  replacement \n23\nprojects directly, indirectly, and cumulatively impact numerous species listed as \n24\nthreatened or endangered under the ESA, as well as designated critical habitat for \n25\nmany of those species.  \n26\n172.  Despite the presence of many listed species, the documented impacts \n27\nof DHS border barrier and road construction on many of these species, and the \n28\nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 43                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.140   Page 44 of 50\n1 significant  number  of  species  listings  and  critical  habitat  designations  in  the \n2 borderlands  region,  Federal  Defendants  have  failed  to  initiate,  reinitiate,  or \n3 complete consultation with FWS in order to ensure that the border wall prototype \n4 project  and  border  wall  replacement  project  do  not  jeopardize  the  continued \n5 existence of any listed species or adversely modify or destroy the designated \n6 critical habitat for any of those species, in violation of Section 7(a)(2).  16 U.S.C. \n7 § 1536(a)(2).   \n8 173.  Federal Defendants have also failed to take any affirmative action to \n9 conserve the many threatened or endangered species impacted by the border wall \n10 prototype project and border wall replacement project, in violation of Section \n11 7(a)(1) of the ESA.  16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(1).  \n \n12\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n13 FOIA Violations  \nMay 2, 2017 FOIA Requests  \n14\nto DHS (2017-HQFO-00717) and CBP (CBP-2017-053692)   \n15  \n16 174.  The Center re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations \n17 made in all preceding paragraphs. \n18 175.  The  Agencies  failed  to  comply  with  the  mandates  of  FOIA \n19 consequent to each Agency’s failure and refusal to: (1) search for and disclose \n20 records that are responsive to the respective FOIA requests; (2) make a timely \n21 and lawful determination on the respective FOIA requests; (3) conduct a search \n22 that  is  reasonably  calculated  to  locate  all  records  that  are  responsive  to  the \n23 respective FOIA requests; (4) provide Plaintiff with records that are responsive to \n24 the respective FOIA requests that may not be withheld pursuant to any of FOIA’s \n25 narrowly construed exemptions to mandatory disclosure; and (5) provide Plaintiff \n26 with reasonably segregable portions of records responsive to the respective FOIA \n27 requests which contains any material that may be lawfully withheld under an \n28 exemption(s).  \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 44                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.141   Page 45 of 50\n1 176.  Plaintiff has a statutory right to a lawful final determination from the \n2 Agencies on the FOIA requests in a manner that complies with FOIA.  The \n3 Agencies have violated Plaintiff’s rights in this regard by unlawfully delaying \n4 their  responses  beyond  the  deadlines  that  FOIA  mandates.    5  U.S.C.  § \n5 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n6 177.  Based  on  the  nature  of  Plaintiff’s  organizational  activities,  it  will \n7 undoubtedly continue to employ FOIA’s disclosure provisions in record requests \n8 to the Agencies in the foreseeable future. \n9 178.  Plaintiff’s organizational activities will be adversely affected if the \n10 Agencies are allowed to continue violating FOIA’s provisions as they have in this \n11 case. \n12 179.  Unless enjoined and made subject to a declaration of Plaintiff’s legal \n13 rights by this Court, the Agencies will continue to violate Plaintiff’s rights to \n14 receive public records under FOIA. \n \n15\nAPA Violations  \n16 (In the Alternative to the FOIA Violations) \n17 180.  Plaintiff  re-alleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations \n18 made in all preceding paragraphs. \n19 181.  The  Agencies  violated  FOIA’s  statutory  mandates  due  to  each \n20 Agency’s  failure  and  refusal  to:  (1)  search  for  and  disclose  records  that  are \n21 responsive  to  the  respective  FOIA  requests;  (2)  make  a  timely  and  lawful \n22 determination  on  the  respective  FOIA  requests;  (3)  conduct  a  search  that  is \n23 reasonably calculated to locate all records that are responsive to the respective \n24 FOIA  requests;  (4)  provide  Plaintiff  with  records  that  are  responsive  to  the \n25 respective FOIA requests that may not be withheld pursuant to any of FOIA’s \n26 narrowly construed exemptions to mandatory disclosure; and (5) provide Plaintiff \n27 with reasonably segregable portions of records responsive to the respective FOIA \n28 requests which contains any material that may be lawfully withheld under an \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 45                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.142   Page 46 of 50\n1 exemption(s).   By repeatedly violating FOIA’s statutory mandates, the Agencies’ \n2 actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with \n3 the law and therefore actionable pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n4 Alternatively,  the  Agencies’  failures  constitute  agency  action  unreasonably \n5 delayed and therefore actionable pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n6 182.  As alleged above, the Agencies’ failure to comply with the mandates \n7 of  FOIA  has  injured  Plaintiff’s  interests  in  public  oversight  of  governmental \n8 operations and is in violation of each Agency’s statutory duties under the APA. \n9 183.  Plaintiff  has  suffered  a  legal  wrong  as  a  result  of  the  Agencies’ \n10 failure to comply with the mandates of FOIA.  As alleged above, the Agencies \n11 violated their statutory duties under the APA and injured Plaintiff’s interests in \n12 public oversight of governmental operations. \n13 184.  Plaintiff has no other adequate remedy at law to redress the violations \n14 noted above. \n15 185.  Plaintiff is entitled to judicial review under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17   WHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  Center  for  Biological  Diversity  prays  that  this \n18 Court: \n19 1.

Set  aside  and  declare  null  and  void  the  waiver  of  laws  authority \n17 contained in IIRIRA section 102(c) due to its constitutional infirmities. \n18 7.  Declare  that  Federal  Defendants  have  violated  NEPA  and  its \n19 implementing regulations with respect to the border wall prototype project and/or \n20 the border wall replacement project by, inter alia, failing to conduct any NEPA \n21 analysis, by failing to provide any opportunity for public participation, and by \n22 failing to take a “hard look” at the potential environmental impacts of the border \n23 wall prototype project and/or border wall replacement project. \n24 8.  Declare  that  Federal  Defendants  violated  the  ESA  by  failing  to \n25 initiate or complete ESA section 7(a)(2) consultation with FWS in order to ensure \n26 that the border wall prototype project and border wall replacement project do not \n27 jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or adversely modify or \n28 destroy the designated critical habitat for those species. \nSecond Amended Complaint     \nPage 47                                                                                                     17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 16   Filed 09/06/17   PageID.144   Page 48 of 50\n1 9.  Declare that Federal Defendants violated the ESA by failing to take \n2 any affirmative action to conserve threatened or endangered species impacted by \n3 the border wall prototype project and border wall replacement project, in violation \n4 of section 7(a)(1) of the ESA. \n5 10.  Enjoin  Federal  Defendants  from  implementing  the  border  wall \n6 prototype project or border wall replacement project, until and unless Federal \n7 Defendants comply with NEPA, the ESA, and the implementing regulations for \n8 those laws. \n9 11.

In addition to \n4  the Executive Branch’s inherent authority over immigration policy, foreign affairs, and \n5  national security, Congress has called on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n6  (“DHS”) to construct physical barriers and roads along the border to deter illegal \n7  crossings in areas of high illegal entry.  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n8  Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA” or “Act”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I \n9  § 102, 110 Stat. 3009-554 (Sept. 30, 1996), as amended.  In order to speed construction \n10  of these border infrastructure projects, Congress gave  the DHS  Secretary  specific \n11  authority to waive any legal requirement necessary to ensure expeditious construction, \n12  and  strictly  limited  judicial  review  of  such  determinations—only  constitutional \n13  challenges are permitted and the only appellate review is a petition of certiorari to the \n14  Supreme Court.  The Act has been repeatedly upheld in the face of legal challenges. \n15  In three suits, now consolidated, Plaintiffs challenge § 102 of the IIRIRA and two \n16  waivers  issued  under  its  authority.    Plaintiffs  collectively  raise  eight  different \n17  constitutional theories, which boil down to two ideas:  (1) that Congress may not \n18  delegate authority to waive other laws, and (2) that Congress may not limit judicial \n19  review of such waiver decisions.  Such theories have no credible basis in constitutional \n20  jurisprudence.  Plaintiffs also attempt to evade § 102’s bar on non-constitutional claims, \n21  arguing that the Court retains jurisdiction to determine whether the DHS Secretary acted \n22  without statutory authority.  This notion, however, cannot be squared with the plain text \n23  of the statute or the Supreme Court’s explanations of the limited scope of such ultra \n24  vires review.  In any event, even if such review were permitted here, Plaintiffs have not \n25  carried  their  heavy  burden  under  this  extraordinarily  deferential  standard,  which \n26  requires them to establish a clear violation of unambiguous statutory requirements.  \n27  Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, and Plaintiffs’ motions for \n28 \n  1 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1109   Page 20 of 99\n \n1  summary judgment should be denied. \n2  BACKGROUND \n3  I.  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n4  Among its responsibilities, DHS is responsible for border security and the \n5  detection and prevention of illegal entry into the United States.  See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. \n6  § 202(a)(1)-(2).  Congress has ordered DHS to achieve and maintain operational \n7  control of the international land border.  See Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law \n8  109-367, § 2(a), 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. § 1701 note).  “Operational \n9  control” means “prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including \n10  entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and \n11  other contraband.”  Id. § 2(b).  Consistent with that mandate, the President has \n12  directed DHS to take immediate steps to prevent all unlawful entries into the United \n13  States, including the immediate construction of physical infrastructure to prevent \n14  illegal entry.  See Exec. Order 13767 §§ 2(a), 4(a), 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 25, 2017). \n15  Among the statutory authorities provided to DHS to carry out its border security \n16  mission is the IIRIRA.  See Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102, 110 Stat. 3009-\n17  554 (Sept. 30, 1996).  Codified at 8 U.S.C § 1103 note (and included as an appendix \n18  at the end of this memorandum), IIRIRA § 102 has been amended several times.  See \n19  Dep’t of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, \n20  Title V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007); Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. \n21  109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006); REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n22  13, Div. B, Title I §102, 119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (May 11, 2005).  The IIRIRA directs \n23  the Secretary of Homeland Security to “take such actions as may be necessary to \n24  install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to \n25  detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal \n26  crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”  Pub. L. No. 104-208, \n27 \n28 \n  2 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1110   Page 21 of 99\n \n1  Div. C., Title I § 102(a), as amended.1   \n2  In § 102(b), Congress provided certain requirements for implementing the \n3  broad mandate laid out in § 102(a).  These requirements have varied over the years.  \n4  For example, in 1996, Congress specified that, in “carrying out subsection (a), the \n5  [agency] shall provide for the construction . . . of second and third fences, in addition \n6  to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads between the fences” in a 14-mile section \n7  near San Diego.  Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C., Title I § 102(b)(1).  In 2006, Congress \n8  struck the reference to San Diego and required construction of “at least 2 layers of \n9  reinforced fencing, [and] the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lights, \n10  cameras, and sensors” in five specified locations along the southern border, with \n11  deadlines for certain of the projects.  Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3.  In the most recent \n12  amendment, Congress removed the specifications set out in 2006 and instead required \n13  “construct[ion of] reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest \n14  border” but gave the Secretary discretion to determine “where fencing would be most \n15  practical and effective” with the goal “to gain operational control of the southwest \n16  border.”  Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V § 564; see also IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(D) \n17  (as amended) (stating that the Secretary is free to determine that the use or placement \n18  of “fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular \n19  location” is not “the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational \n20  control over the international border” at that location).   \n21  Section 102(c) seeks to ensure expeditious construction pursuant to the mandate \n22  laid out in § 102(a) in two ways.  First, it permits waiver of legal impediments:  \n23  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such \n24 \nSecretary, in such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to \n25 \n                                           \n26  1 In 1996, responsibility for border enforcement lay with the Attorney General.  The \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, created DHS and transferred \n27 \nborder enforcement authority to it.  In 2005, IIRIRA § 102 was amended to refer to \n28  the DHS Secretary.  See H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.). \n  3 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1111   Page 22 of 99\n \n1  ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this \nsection.   Any such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon \n2 \nbeing published in the Federal Register. \n3 \nId. § 102(c)(1).  This provision had originally been limited to the Endangered Species \n4 \nAct (“ESA”) and the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), see Pub. L. No. \n5 \n104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(c), but the REAL ID Act expanded it to its current \n6 \nbreadth.  See Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. 109-72, at 171-72 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.), ECF \n7 \nNo. 18-2 (explaining “Congress’ intent that the Secretary’s discretionary waiver \n8 \nauthority extends to any local, state or federal statute, regulation, or administrative \n9 \norder that could impede expeditious construction of border security infrastructure”); \n10 \nsee also Ex. 1, H.R. Rep. 104-828, at 200 (Sept. 24, 1996) (Conf. Rep.), ECF No. 18-\n11 \n2 (explaining that the original waiver of two environmental laws was intended “to \n12 \nfacilitate a uniform construction of necessary fences and roads”). \n13 \n  Second, § 102(c) provides for limited and streamlined judicial review of the \n14 \nSecretary’s exercise of this waiver authority.  Federal district courts have “exclusive \n15 \njurisdiction” to hear such claims, and the only “cause of action or claim” that may be \n16 \nbrought is one “alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States” that is \n17 \nfiled within sixty days of the Secretary’s action.  Id. § 102(c)(2)(A)-(B).  The only \n18 \nappellate review is a certiorari petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Id. § 102(c)(2)(C).  \n19 \nThis provision was adopted by the conference committee for the appropriations bill of \n20 \nwhich the REAL ID Act was a part.  The House bill would have entirely barred \n21 \njudicial review, see Ex. 3, 109th Cong., H.R. 1268, Div. B § 102 (engrossed in House, \n22 \nMar. 16, 2005), ECF No. 18-2, but some had expressed concern about the \n23 \nconstitutionality of such a total bar on review.  See, e.g., Ex. 7, 151 Cong. Rec. H553, \n24 \n556-57 (Feb. 10, 2005), ECF No. 18-2 (statement of Cong. Farr) (introducing \n25 \nCongressional Research Service letter observing that Congress does not clearly have \n26 \n“authority to prevent courts . . . from addressing and remedying issues arising under \n27 \nthe United States Constitution”).  Ultimately, the conference report explained that \n28 \n  4 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1112   Page 23 of 99\n \n1  Congress was providing “federal judicial review for claims alleging that the actions or \n2  decisions of the Secretary violate the United States Constitution,” and that the strict \n3  limits on judicial review reflected the “Conferees’ intent [] to ensure that judicial \n4  review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction \n5  of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary’s \n6  waiver.”  H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 172. \n7  II.  THE SECRETARY’S EXERCISE OF WAIVER AUTHORITY \n8  Pursuant to the IIRIRA, the Secretary has repeatedly issued waiver \n9  determinations as necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads \n10  along the border.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 19078 (Apr. 8, 2008); 73 Fed. Reg. 19077 (Apr. 8, \n11  2008); 72 Fed. Reg. 60870 (Oct. 26, 2007); 72 Fed. Reg. 2535 (Jan. 19, 2007); 70 \n12  Fed. Reg. 55622 (Sept. 22, 2005).  Every judicial challenge to these determinations \n13  has been dismissed.  See County of El Paso v. Chertoff, No. 08-196, 2008 WL \n14  4372693 (W.D. Tex. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 915 (2009); Save Our Heritage v. \n15  Gonzalez, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 (D.D.C. 2008); Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. \n16  Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2007), cert. denied, 554 U.S. 918 (2008); Sierra Club v. \n17  Ashcroft, No. 04-272, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005).  \n18  On August 2 and September 12, 2017, DHS published two additional waiver \n19  determinations under the IIRIRA.  The first waiver determination concerned a fifteen-\n20  mile stretch of border in the U.S. Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector.  See 82 Fed. Reg. \n21  35984 (Aug. 2, 2017) (“San Diego Waiver”).  The second concerned a three-mile \n22  stretch of border in the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector near Calexico, \n23  California.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 42829 (Sept. 12, 2017) (“Calexico Waiver”).  For each \n24  waiver, the Secretary (or Acting Secretary) made three factual determinations: \n25    that the project area “is an area of high illegal entry,” 82 Fed. Reg. at \n35985, 42830;   \n26 \n  that there is “a need to construct physical barriers and roads . . . in the \n27  vicinity of the border of the United States to deter illegal crossings in this \nProject Area,” id. at 35985, 42830;   \n28 \n  5 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1113   Page 24 of 99\n \n1    that exercise of waiver authority under the IIRIRA was necessary “to \nensure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads in the \n2 \nProject Area,” id. at 35985, 42830.  \n3    \nAccordingly, the Secretary announced the waiver of certain laws “with respect to the \n4 \nconstruction of roads and physical barriers . . . in the Project Area.”  82 Fed. Reg. at \n5 \n35985, 42830.  As relevant here, the waived laws include NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 \n6 \net seq., the ESA, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq., and (for the San Diego Waiver) the \n7 \nCoastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq., along with “all \n8 \nfederal, state, or other laws, regulations, and legal requirements of, deriving from, or \n9 \nrelated to the subject of, the [listed] statutes.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35985, 42830. \n10 \nConstruction has been completed for one project conducted pursuant to the San \n11 \nDiego Waiver—border wall prototypes built on an approximately two acre plot at the \n12 \neastern end of the secondary barrier near San Diego.  The border wall prototypes are \n13 \nintended both to deter illegal entry at that location and to assist DHS in evaluating \n14 \nvarious design features for inclusion in a border wall standard to be used in future \n15 \nconstruction.  82 Fed. Reg. at 35985; see also Exs. 12, 13, Solicitation Nos. \n16 \nHSBP1017R0022, HSBP1017R0023 (as amended Apr. 1, 2017), ECF No. 18-2.  \n17 \nConstruction for this project began on September 26, 2017, and was completed on \n18 \nOctober 26, 2017 as scheduled.  See Press Release (Oct. 26, 2017) (link) (attached as \n19 \nEx. 20); Ex. 15, Press Release (Sept. 26, 2017) (link), ECF No. 18-2.   \n20 \nThe only other projects that will be conducted pursuant to these waiver \n21 \ndeterminations are currently in the contracting process.  These projects involve \n22 \nreplacement of the existing primary fencing near San Diego and Calexico, which was \n23 \nprimarily constructed in the early 1990s using a design that is “no longer optimal for \n24 \nBorder Patrol operations.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35984-85, 42830.  These project will rely \n25 \non existing appropriations.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. \n26 \n115-31, Div. F, Title VI, 131 Stat. 135, 434 (May 5, 2017) (appropriating $341 \n27 \nmillion “to replace approximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian and vehicle \n28 \n  6 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1114   Page 25 of 99\n \n1  border fencing along the southwest border . . . and to add gates to existing barriers” \n2  and $77 million “for new border road construction”).  For the Calexico project, a \n3  contract was awarded in November 2017, and construction is expected to begin no \n4  earlier than February 12, 2018.  For the San Diego project, contract proposals have \n5  been solicited, but no contract has been awarded, and construction is not expected to \n6  begin until May 2018. \n7  Even where the Secretary has waived environmental and other laws, U.S. \n8  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) still consults with relevant stakeholders \n9  pursuant to § 102(b)(1)(C).  As CBP explained at a congressional hearing, it does not \n10  “turn[] its back on environmental stewardship or continued consultation with \n11  stakeholders.”  Ex. 10, Walls & Waivers: Expedited Construction of the Southern \n12  Border Wall and Collateral Impacts to Communities and the Environment:  Joint \n13  Oversight Field Hearing Before Subcommittees to H.

Vitiello, CBP Chief Patrol Officer, Rio Grande Valley \n16  Sector); see also id. at 19 (statement of Rick Shultz, Nat’l Borderland Coordinator, \n17  U.S. Dep’t of the Interior (“DOI”)) (explaining that when the DHS Secretary issued \n18  two waivers “he reaffirmed DHS’s commitment to environmental stewardship” and \n19  that “[t]his commitment, as it applies to DOI-administered lands and programs, \n20  included mitigation funding up to $50 million for threatened and endangered \n21  species”).  For example, in connection with the prototypes project, CBP consulted \n22  with relevant stakeholders, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  It also \n23  conducted site surveys for environmental and endangered species concerns, and \n24  required the contractors to comply with best practices designed to mitigate any \n25  environmental harm.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n4  On September 6, 2017, the Center for Biological Diversity (“the Center”) \n5  amended a pending suit to challenge the San Diego Waiver.  See 2d Am. Compl., Ctr. \n6  for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, No. 3:17-cv-1215 (S.D. \n7  Cal.).  Shortly thereafter, the Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, and Animal Legal \n8  Defense Fund (collectively “Coalition Plaintiffs”) filed suit, challenging both waivers.  \n9  See Defenders of Wildlife v. Duke, No. 3:17-cv-1873 (Sept. 14, 2017).  Finally, the \n10  State of California and the California Coastal Commission (collectively “California”) \n11  sued to challenge both waivers.  California v. United States, No. 3:17-cv-1911 (Sept. \n12  20, 2017).  Pursuant to the parties’ joint motion, on October 24, 2017, the Court \n13  consolidated the cases, set aside answer and discovery obligations, and set a briefing \n14  schedule for cross-motions for summary judgment.  See ECF No. 22. \n15  ARGUMENT \n16  I.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n17 \nSummary judgment is appropriate on a showing “that there is no genuine issue \n18 \nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \n19 \nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “If the non-moving party fails to make a sufficient \n20 \nshowing of an element of its case, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \n21 \nof law.”  Michel v. United States, No. 16-277, 2017 WL 3966827, at *6 (S.D. Cal. \n22 \nSept. 8, 2017) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)).  “[A] \n23 \nfederal court cannot reach the merits of any dispute until it confirms that it retains \n24 \nsubject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues presented.”  Luna v. Greenlight Fin. \n25 \nServs., No. 13-623, 2013 WL 2120919, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 15, 2013) (citing Steel \n26 \nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Environ., 523 U.S. 83, 94–95 (1998)).  Plaintiffs have the \n27 \nburden to establish jurisdiction.  See Washam v. Rabine, No. 3:13-2433, 2013 WL \n28 \n  8 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1116   Page 27 of 99\n \n1  1849233, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 1, 2013).  “[W]hen parties submit cross-motions for \n2  summary judgment, each motion must be considered on its merits.”  Mir v. \n3  Kirchmeyer, No. 12-2340, 2017 WL 4271892, at * (S.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2017) \n4  (quotation marks omitted).2  \n5  II.  CALIFORNIA HAS NOT CARRIED ITS BURDEN TO ESTABLISH \nSTANDING \n6 \nBecause Plaintiffs here raise overlapping but often distinct claims which could \n7 \nbe subject to distinct relief, each set of Plaintiffs must establish their standing for the \n8 \nCourt to have jurisdiction over any claims unique to them.  See Town of Chester v. \n9 \nLaroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017) (holding that “when there are \n10 \nmultiple plaintiffs . . . . [a]t least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of \n11 \nrelief requested in the complaint”); Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n, 554 U.S. 724, \n12 \n734 (2008) (“[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press \n13 \nand for each form of relief that is sought.”).  In particular, California has not carried \n14 \nits burden to establish standing as to each of its many claims.  California has not tied \n15 \nits standing theories to each claim.  And three of its standing theories are dubious at \n16 \nbest:  claiming “injury to California’s tourism economy from the ‘chilling effect’ on \n17 \nCalifornia tourism from Mexico,” “infring[ment] upon California’s procedural and \n18 \nsovereign right in creating and enforcing its own laws, and California’s alleged \n19 \ninterest in “receiving the benefits afforded to it under NEPA and the CZMA.”  Cal. \n20 \nBr. at 14.  The first theory suffers from a traceability problem because California has \n21 \nnot established that such effects on legal travel would be caused by measures taken \n22 \nalong the border to prevent illegal entry.  The second theory fails to establish an injury \n23 \nor causation because California identifies no state law that it would be prevented from \n24 \nenforcing.  And for the first and third theories, it appears that California is asserting \n25 \nnot its own interests but those of its citizens.  This Circuit has repeatedly refused to \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n2 Hereinafter, internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations are omitted from \n28  quotations unless otherwise noted. \n  9 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1117   Page 28 of 99\n \n1  permit a state to assert an interest brought qua parens patriae against the United \n2  States.  See State of Alaska v. Nat'l Parks & Conservation Ass'n, Inc., 981 F.2d 1259 \n3  (9th Cir. 1992); Nevada v. Burford, 918 F.2d 854, 858 (9th Cir. 1990).  The Supreme \n4  Court has clearly stated that with respect to the citizens’ rights in relation to the \n5  federal government, “it is the United States, and not the State, which represents them \n6  as parens patriae.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 610 \n7  n.16 (1982). \n8  III.  PLAINTIFFS’ NON-CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS REGARDING THE \nWAIVER DECISIONS MUST BE DISMISSED \n9 \nA.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Consider Plaintiffs’ Non-\n10 \nConstitutional Claims Regarding the Waiver Decisions  \n11 \nIt is axiomatic that federal courts “are courts of limited jurisdiction possessing \n12 \nonly that power authorized by Constitution and statute.”  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. \n13 \n251, 256 (2013).  Accordingly, “district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a \n14 \nstatutory basis.”  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 552 \n15 \n(2005); see also Duldulao v. INS, 90 F.3d 396, 400 (9th Cir. 1996) (“Congress has the \n16 \nconstitutional authority to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.”).  \n17 \nPlaintiffs rely on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346(a)(2) for the Court’s jurisdiction to hear \n18 \ntheir non-constitutional claims.  See, e.g., Coal. Pls.’ Am. Compl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 23.  \n19 \nBut these general grants of jurisdiction over claims arising under federal law and \n20 \nclaims against the United States are “subject . . . to preclusion-of-review statutes \n21 \ncreated or retained by Congress.”  Hata v. United States, 23 F.3d 230, 232 n.2 (9th \n22 \nCir. 1994) (quoting Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977)). \n23 \nPlaintiffs otherwise attempt to satisfy their burden of demonstrating jurisdiction \n24 \nby relying on “the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of \n25 \nadministrative action.”  Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, \n26 \n670 (1986); see Aguayo v. Jewell, 827 F.3d 1213, 1223 (9th Cir. 2016) (“Preclusion of \n27 \njudicial review is not lightly inferred, and usually will not be found absent a clear \n28 \n  10 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1118   Page 29 of 99\n \n1  command of the statute.”).  Congress, however, is free to leave district courts without \n2  jurisdiction to review non-constitutional claims against an agency.  See Estep v. \n3  United States, 327 U.S. 114, 120 (1946) (“[E]xcept when the Constitution requires it, \n4  judicial review of administrative action may be granted or withheld as Congress \n5  chooses.”); see also Bowen, 476 U.S. at 672-73 (“Subject to constitutional constraints, \n6  Congress can, of course, make exceptions to the historic practice whereby courts \n7  review agency action.”); Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 349 \n8  (1984) (“This presumption, like all presumptions used in interpreting statutes, may be \n9  overcome . . . .”).3  Indeed, Congress noted as much in the APA itself by providing an \n10  exemption from judicial review “to the extent that—(1) statutes precluding judicial \n11  review.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985) (stating \n12  that § 701(a)(1) “applies where Congress has expressed an intent to preclude judicial \n13  review”).  The question of this Court’s jurisdiction accordingly focuses attention on \n14  congressional intent.  See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Donovan, 769 F.3d 1344, 1347-48 (9th \n15  Cir. 1985) (“The question is one of congressional intent[.]”). \n16  1.  Congress plainly intended to bar all judicial review of non-\nconstitutional claims \n17 \nCongressional intent to withhold jurisdiction to review agency action can be \n18 \nshown by “specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator \n19 \nof congressional intent,” or “inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a \n20 \nwhole.”  Block, 467 U.S. at 349; Maldonado v. Fasano, 67 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1174 \n21 \n(S.D. Cal. 1999).  One must begin with the statutory text itself.  See Miranda v. \n22 \nAnchondo, 684 F.3d 844, 849 (9th Cir. 2012).  Here, the statutory text is plain enough \n23 \n24                                             \n3 See also Switchmen's Union v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 320 U.S. 297, 301 (1946) (“All \n25 \nconstitutional questions aside, it is for Congress to determine how the rights which it \n26  creates will be enforced.”); Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607, 622 & n.101 (D.C. Cir. \n1977) (observing that nothing “prevent[s] [Congress] from shielding even the most \n27 \npatent deviation from the statutory scheme from judicial redress where the \n28  Constitution is in no wise implicated.” (citing Switchmen’s Union, 320 U.S. at 301)). \n  11 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1119   Page 30 of 99\n \n1  to dispose of the question.   \n2  Congress has expressly withdrawn district court jurisdiction to review non-\n3  constitutional challenges to the Secretary’s exercise of waiver authority:   \n4  The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction \nto hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any \n5 \ndecision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n6  paragraph (1).  A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a \nviolation of the Constitution of the United States.  The court shall not \n7 \nhave jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.   \n8 \nIIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  This statutory language is emphatic and \n9 \ncomprehensive in several respects.  First, it expansively encompasses “all causes or \n10 \nclaims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made” pursuant to \n11 \n§ 102(c)(1)’s waiver authority.  Id.  Second, it expressly identifies the sort of suits that \n12 \nmay be brought:  “only . . . alleging a violation of the Constitution.”  Id.  Third, it \n13 \nexpressly removes district court jurisdiction over “any claim not specified in this \n14 \nsubparagraph.”  Id.   \n15 \nThere is no reason to doubt the import of this plain language.  The Ninth Circuit \n16 \nhas observed that “many . . . provisions of the IIRIRA . . . do in fact specify that \n17 \nparticular decisions are within the sole or unreviewable discretion of the Attorney \n18 \nGeneral.”  Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 690 (9th Cir. \n19 \n2003).  And a court in this district found § 102(c) straightforward, declaring that it \n20 \n“restricted judicial review of any claims to constitutional claims.”  See Sierra Club, \n21 \n2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *28; see also id. (holding that Congress \n22 \n“circumscribed the judicial review available for decisions of the Secretary in the \n23 \nexercise of delegated authority to expedite construction”); id. at *38 (“The only \n24 \njusticiable controversies Congress left for the courts to decide in this connection are \n25 \nconstitutional claims.”).  Indeed, § 102(c) is strikingly similar to another provision of \n26 \nthe IIRIRA which courts have found to preclude judicial review: \n27 \nThe Attorney General has sole discretion to waive [§ 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)] in \n28  the case of an immigrant who [meets certain conditions], if it is \n  12 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1120   Page 31 of 99\n \n1  established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that [certain \nconditions are met]. No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision \n2 \nor action by the Attorney General regarding a waiver under this clause. \n3 \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v).  Courts have dismissed challenges to exercise of such \n4 \nwaiver authority because the provision “specifically precludes judicial review and \n5 \nvests DHS with sole authority to waive inadmissibility bars.”  De Carreon v. \n6 \nMukasey, No. 08-0501, 2008 WL 11336922, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2008); Lugo-\n7 \nMiramontes v. Holder, 464 F. App’x 639 (9th Cir. 2011) (“We lack jurisdiction to \n8 \nreview the agency’s decision [under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)] . . . .”); Herrera-\n9 \nCastillo v. Holder, 573 F.3d 1004, 1010 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding that the court “lacks \n10 \njurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision [under § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)]”).   \n11 \nThere are many other examples of Congress using similarly unambiguous “shall \n12 \nnot have jurisdiction” formulations to partially or completely bar judicial review.  See, \n13 \ne.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1359 (“A district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in \n14 \nwhich any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made \n15 \nor joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.”); Upper Deck Int’l B.V. v. Upper \n16 \nDeck Co., No. 11-1741, 2012 WL 1713453, at *7 (S.D. Cal. May 15, 2012) \n17 \n(acknowledging that § 1359 “denies a district court jurisdiction” under the specified \n18 \ncircumstances).4  In sum, Congress could not have been clearer in stating that all non-\n19 \nconstitutional claims are barred.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ attempts to challenge the \n20 \nSecretary’s action on non-constitutional grounds must be rejected for lack of \n21 \n22                                             \n4  See also, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(b)(1) (providing for “mandatory detention of \n23 \nsuspected terrorist” but strictly limiting judicial review: “Judicial review of any action \n24  or decision relating to this section . . . is available exclusively in habeas corpus \nproceedings consistent with this subsection. Except as provided in the preceding \n25 \nsentence, no court shall have jurisdiction to review, by habeas corpus petition or \n26  otherwise, any such action or decision.”); 22 U.S.C. § 6450 (“No court shall have \njurisdiction to review any Presidential determination or agency action under this \n27 \nchapter or any amendment made by this chapter.” (adopted by the Int’l Religious \n28  Freedom Act of 1998, Pub.

See, e.g., Kerr v. Jewell, 836 F.3d 1048, 1058 & n.7 (9th Cir. 2016) \n2  (upholding dismissal for lack of jurisdiction “because it is fairly discernible that \n3  Congress intended the statute’s review scheme to provide the exclusive avenue to \n4  judicial review”); Molly-Butcher v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 12 F.3d 249, 252 (D.C. \n5  Cir. 1994) (“The clarity with which Congress has spoken makes it unnecessary to \n6  invoke a presumption of reviewability as petitioner urges.”).5  \n7  2.  The legislative history and statutory context support the plain \nmeaning of the jurisdictional bar \n8 \nThe plain meaning of the Act should be the end of the matter.  Aragon-Salazar \n9 \nv. Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 704 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[Courts] must presume that a \n10 \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. \n11 \nWhen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: \n12 \njudicial inquiry is complete.” (quoting Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. \n13 \n249, 253-254 (1992))); Santiago Salgado v. Garcia, 384 F.3d 769, 771 (9th Cir. 2004) \n14 \n(“In construing federal statutes, we presume that the ordinary meaning of the words \n15 \nchosen by Congress accurately express its legislative intent.”).  But if the Court were \n16 \nto find any ambiguity in the text, the legislative history and statutory context also \n17 \n18                                             \n5 The Coalition Plaintiffs alone press the untenable theory that certain § 102 \n19 \nrequirements are prerequisite “conditions that must be satisfied before [the] Secretary \n20  can invoke” the waiver authority, thus seeking to subject DHS to APA review even \nwhen a waiver has been issued.  Coal. Pls.’ Br. at 6.  However, the APA itself does \n21 \nnot apply “when Congress expressly bars review by statute.”  Pinnacle Armor, 648 \n22  F.3d at 719.  See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1) (“This chapter applies . . . except to the extent \nthat—(1) statutes preclude judicial review[.]”).  And the aspects of the statute \n23 \nPlaintiffs single out are not segregable here.  Under the APA, a plaintiff must \n24  challenge a final agency action.  See Or. Nat’l Desert Ass'n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 465 \nF.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006).  But the only final agency actions that Plaintiffs \n25 \nchallenge are the issuance of the waivers.  Accordingly, because Congress has barred \n26  judicial review of all non-constitutional claims “arising from any action undertaken, or \nany decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to [the waiver \n27 \nprovision],” § 102(c)(2)(A), traditional APA review cannot be appropriate, no matter \n28  how § 102 is interpreted. \n  14 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1122   Page 33 of 99\n \n1  support the government’s reading. \n2  The limitation on judicial review was adopted as part of the REAL ID Act of \n3  2005.  The underlying bill passed by the House of Representatives would have gone \n4  farther and entirely barred judicial review, see 109th Cong., H.R. 1268, Div. B § 102 \n5  (engrossed in House, Mar. 16, 2005),6 which was a significant concern to opponents \n6  of the bill.7  Because the Senate passed a substitute version of the bill that differed \n7  substantially from the House version (and did not include any provision regarding \n8  IIRIRA § 102), the bill was finalized by a conference committee.  See H.R. Rep. No. \n9  109-72 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.).  The conference committee noted that the House \n10  bill “would prohibit judicial review” and explained that the committee had “revised \n11  the House provision in the following respects,” including “provid[ing] federal judicial \n12  review for claims alleging that the actions or decisions of the Secretary violate the \n13  United States Constitution.”  See H.R. Rep. No. 109-72 at 171-72.  The report further \n14  explained that “[t]he Conferees’ intent is to ensure that judicial review of actions or \n15  decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction of border security \n16  infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary’s waiver.”  Id. at 172.  \n17  Thus, the conference report supports the plain text in two respects.  First, it makes \n18  clear that the House’s complete bar on judicial review was modified only to permit \n19                                             \n6 “[N]o court, administrative agency, or other entity shall have jurisdiction—(A) to \n20 \nhear any cause or claim arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by \n21  the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1); or (B) to order \ncompensatory, declaratory, injunctive, equitable, or any other relief for damage \n22 \nalleged to arise from any such action or decision.” \n23 \n7  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) (statement of Congresswoman \n24  Davis) (objecting to provision because it “bars judicial review of any claim arising \nfrom the construction of barriers and roads at borders”); 151 Cong. Rec. H559 (Feb. \n25 \n10, 2005) (statement of Congressman Mark Udall) (“The bill also removes any \n26  judicial review of the waiving of these laws.”); Ex. 8, 151 Cong. Rec. E247, ECF No. \n18-2 (statement of Congressman James Langevin) (“This overly broad provision \n27 \nwould give unprecedented power to the Secretary to undertake large construction \n28  projects without any accountability or judicial review.”). \n  15 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1123   Page 34 of 99\n \n1  judicial review of constitutional claims.  Standing alone, this express provision for \n2  constitutional review but no other review indicates that ultra vires review was \n3  intentionally excluded.  Second, the conference report establishes that strictly limited \n4  judicial review was fundamental to the statutory scheme.  The purpose of the waiver \n5  authority is the “expeditious completion” of necessary construction, § 102(C)(2)(A), \n6  and Congress was expressly concerned with litigation delays.  See, e.g., Ex. 2, H.R. \n7  Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (“Continued delays caused by \n8  litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with respect to \n9  other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security infrastructure \n10  along the border, such as the Coastal Zone Management Act.”).8  Accordingly, the \n11  text cannot be interpreted to permit non-constitutional review that would frustrate the \n12  congressional goal to prevent litigation delays.  Cf. NLRB v. United Food & \n13  Commercial Workers Union, 484 U.S. 112, 130-133 (1988) (holding that \n14  “prosecutorial” decisions of the General Counsel of the NLRB are not subject to \n15  judicial review, in part because review “would involve lengthy judicial proceedings in \n16  precisely the area where Congress was convinced that speed of resolution is most \n17  necessary”).9 \n18                                             \n8  See also Ex. 6, 151 Cong. Rec. H471 (Feb. 9, 2005) (statement of Cong. Hoekstra) \n19 \n(“Authorized by Congress in 1996, [the San Diego barrier] has yet to be completed \n20  because of on-going environmental litigation.”); Ex. 7, 151 Cong. Rec. H554 (Feb. 9, \n2005) (statement of Cong. Sensenbrenner) (referencing “endless litigation against \n21 \nplugging the hole in the fence south of San Diego” and noting that “[w]e were able to \n22  win World War II quicker than we were able to complete this fence”). \n9  Indeed, all prior challengers to the exercise of § 102(c) waiver authority—including \n23 \nPlaintiffs Defenders of Wildlife and Sierra Club—accepted as a given that the only \n24 \navailable legal challenges are constitutional claims.  See, e.g., Cert. Petition at 2, \nDefenders of Wildlife & Sierra Club v. Chertoff, No. 07-1180 (S. Ct. Mar. 2008) \n25 \n(“[T]here is no judicial review to determine whether the Secretary’s waiver decision \n26 \naccords with the statutory standard.”); id. at 5 (“The provision also precluded all \njudicial review of any claim that a waiver under Section 102 exceeded the scope of the \n27 \nSecretary’s delegated authority.”); id. at 13 (“Section 102 . . . unequivocally precludes \n28 \nall judicial review[.]”); see also Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 122  \n  16 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1124   Page 35 of 99\n \n1  3.  Plaintiffs cannot evade the jurisdictional bar by framing their \nclaims as ultra vires challenges  \n2 \nPlaintiffs cannot evade Congress’ clear jurisdictional limitation by citing a \n3 \nseries of cases reviewing whether an agency acted ultra vires even when other sorts of \n4 \njudicial review were impliedly or expressly prohibited.  See Ctr. Br. at 10-15; Coal. \n5 \nBr. at 12; Cal. Br. at 13.  While these cases show that courts are less inclined to find \n6 \nthat Congress intended to prohibit ultra vires review (and review of constitutional \n7 \nclaims) than merits review, they cannot overturn plainly expressed congressional \n8 \nintent to prohibit all review other than constitutional claims.  Indeed, the Supreme \n9 \nCourt has made clear that these cases merely apply “the familiar proposition that ‘only \n10 \nupon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent \n11 \nshould the courts restrict access to judicial review.’”  Bd. of Governors of Fed. \n12 \nReserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin. Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 44 (1991) (quoting Abbott Labs. v. \n13 \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967)).  \n14 \nThe presumption of judicial review is merely an “interpretive guide” that is \n15 \n“dislodge[d]” when Congress provides “clear and convincing evidence” that it intends \n16 \nto preclude judicial review.  Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 251 (2010).  In 1943, \n17 \nfor example, the Supreme Court held that the Railway Labor Act—by providing \n18 \njudicial review for certain other matters but only administrative review of an agency’s \n19 \ncertification of a collective bargaining representative—impliedly precluded judicial \n20 \nreview because congressional “intent seems plain” that “[t]here was to be no dragging \n21 \nof the controversy into other tribunals of law.”  See Switchmen’s Union v. Nat’l \n22 \nMediation Bd., 320 U.S. 297, 305 (1943).  A few year later, in what became the \n23 \nseminal ultra vires review decision, the Supreme Court reaffirmed Switchmen’s \n24 \n25 \n                                           \n26  (statement of Sandra Purohit, Defenders of Wildlife) (observing that the withdrawal of \n“judicial review with the exception of Constitutional challenges, thus preclud[es] any \n27 \nindependent review of whether the DHS Secretary has only waived the laws \n28  ‘necessary’ for the expeditious construction of border walls”). \n  17 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1125   Page 36 of 99\n \n1  Union’s focus on congressional intent and applied it to ultra vires review.  See \n2  Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188 (1958).  Kyne held that courts “cannot lightly infer \n3  that Congress does not intend judicial protection of rights it confers against agency \n4  action taken in excess of delegated powers.”  Id. at 190.  Because the agency action \n5  was “contrary to a specific [statutory] prohibition” that was “clear and mandatory” \n6  and “deprived the professional employees of a ‘right’ assured to them by Congress,” \n7  the Court concluded that Congress intended to permit ultra vires review.  Id. at 188-\n8  90.10   \n9  The Supreme Court has more recently clarified Kyne’s limited scope.  Kyne and \n10  its progeny do not “authoriz[e] judicial review of any agency action that is alleged to \n11  have exceeded the agency’s statutory authority.”  MCorp Fin., 502 U.S. at 43 \n12  (emphasis added).  Instead, Kyne does not apply where “Congress has spoken clearly \n13  and directly” to preclude review.  Id. at 44; see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United \n14  States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (stating that presumption of judicial review \n15  for administrative action “is overcome” when “Congress expressly bars review by \n16  statute”). \n17  Congressional intent to prohibit ultra vires review is at least as clear here as it \n18  was in MCorp Financial.  Here, just as in MCorp Financial, Congress “has spoken \n19  clearly and directly” to preclude all judicial review (except for constitutional claims).  \n20  In MCorp Financial, the relevant statute stated that “except as otherwise provided in \n21  this section or under [two other sections] of this title no court shall have jurisdiction to \n22  affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any [Board] notice or \n23 \n                                           \n24  10 The Coalition Plaintiffs have suggested that ultra vires review is a matter of the \nCourt’s “inherent authority.”  See Coal. Br. at 2, 12, 27.  This view has not been \n25 \nadopted by the Ninth Circuit and is irreconcilable with MCorp Financial’s \n26  explanation that such review is grounded in the rebuttable presumption of \ncongressional intent to permit such review.  See 502 U.S. at 44; see also Kyne, 358 \n27 \nU.S. at 190 (rooting ultra vires review in the “inference . . . that Congress intended the \n28  statutory provisions governing the general jurisdiction of those courts to control.”). \n  18 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1126   Page 37 of 99\n \n1  order under this section.”  12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1); see 502 U.S. at 44.  The Supreme \n2  Court held that ultra vires review under Kyne was unavailable because “the clarity of \n3  the congressional preclusion of review” in this statute stood in marked contrast to the \n4  statute at issue in Kyne, in which it had only been argued that a judicial review statute \n5  “implied, by its silence, a preclusion of review of the contested determination.”  502 \n6  U.S. at 44.  Section 102 of the IIRIRA, like 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1), is an express \n7  preclusion provision rather than an implied one.  The only avenue for challenging \n8  agency action here is a constitutional claim.  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how \n9  Congress could have been any more comprehensive or what Plaintiffs would accept as \n10  sufficient evidence of intent to bar ultra vires claims.  See Maldonado, 67 F. Supp. 2d \n11  at 1182 n.13 (holding that even in “attempt[ing] to read the jurisdiction stripping \n12  provisions of [the IIRIRA] narrowly, [a court] cannot escape the principle that ‘courts \n13  must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute \n14  what it says.’” (quoting Connecticut Nat. Bank, 503 U.S. at 253-54)); cf. United States \n15  v. Spiegel, 995 F.2d 138, 140 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting that the “statutory language [of \n16  § 1818(i)(1)] leaves no room to doubt that Congress provided only one avenue for \n17  challenging” agency action under that section). \n18  As another court has noted, the presumption in favor of judicial review cannot \n19  shift the balance “where, as here, Congress has been so explicit in stating a prohibition \n20  against judicial review—federal courts are not, after all, superlegislatures entitled to \n21  invoke a generalized presumption to trump an express ‘hands off’ direction from \n22  Congress.”  Am. Soc’y of Anesthesiologists v. Shalala, 90 F. Supp. 2d 973, 975 (N.D. \n23  Ill. 2000), aff’d, 279 F.3d 447 (7th Cir. 2002) (addressing 42 U.S.C. § 1395w–4). \n24  None of Plaintiffs’ arguments against the plain reading of the statutory language \n25  is meritorious.  First, the Center argues that “any decision made . . . pursuant to \n26  paragraph (1)” demonstrates an intent to permit judicial review of whether the “waiver \n27  was . . . authorized by § 102.”  Ctr. Br. at 11.  But the Center identifies no support for \n28 \n  19 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1127   Page 38 of 99\n \n1  its aggressive interpretation of “pursuant to.”  Instead, the phrase is naturally read to \n2  merely identify the basis on which the Secretary took an action or made a decision.  It \n3  is parallel to the language of the statute at issue in MCorp Financial:  a “notice or \n4  order under this section.”  12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1) (emphasis added).  Such ordinary \n5  cross-references are far different from the clauses the Ninth Circuit has previously \n6  found to narrow the scope of a jurisdiction-limiting provision.  See, e.g., Spencer \n7  Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 688-90 (9th Cir. 2003) (interpreting 8 \n8  U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which provides “no court shall have jurisdiction to review \n9  . . . any other decision or action of the Attorney General the authority for which is \n10  specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General[.]”).  In \n11  Spencer Enterprises, the Circuit relied on the unique phrasing that the “authority . . . \n12  be in the discretion of the Attorney General” to conclude that the jurisdiction-stripping \n13  provision applied only to “matters of pure discretion, rather than discretion guided by \n14  legal standards.”  Id. at 690.  But here, nothing in the text demonstrates an intent to \n15  narrow the jurisdiction-limiting provision.  To the contrary, as discussed above, \n16  Congress repeatedly used comprehensive language.  See supra Arg. § II(A)(1). \n17  Second, Plaintiffs improperly extrapolate from the fact that courts have \n18  distinguished between congressional intent to bar merits review of a decision and \n19  intent to bar ultra vires review.  See Ctr. Br. at 11-15; Coal. Br. at 12.  As MCorp \n20  Financial makes clear, Congress can and does craft statutes that preclude both types \n21  of judicial review.  In this regard, Plaintiffs incorrectly suggest that United States v. \n22  Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037 (9th Cir. 1992), a case involving the Export Administration \n23  Act (EAA), narrowly cabined MCorp Financial in this Circuit.  See Ctr. Br. at 15; \n24  Coal. Br. at 12.  To the contrary, Bozarov—in dicta11—merely rejected the argument \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n11 Bozarov addressed judicial review merely to “bolster” its already settled conclusion \nthat the EAA’s preclusion of judicial review did not violate the nondelegation \n27 \ndoctrine.  974 F.2d at 1041 (“[D]oes a delegation of legislative power to the executive \n28 \nthat is statutorily exempt from judicial review violate the nondelegation doctrine?”); \n  20 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1128   Page 39 of 99\n \n1  that MCorp Financial inherently prohibits ultra vires review wherever a “statute \n2  precludes judicial review.”  974 F.2d at 1045 n.8.12  The Ninth Circuit expressly \n3  limited its holding to “the EAA’s preclusion of judicial review,” id. at 1045 n.6, and \n4  similarly limited its discussion in the footnote on which Plaintiffs rely to whether \n5  “MCorp precludes judicial review of this type of claim under the EAA.”  Id. at 1045 \n6  n.8 (emphasis added).  For purposes of that analysis, the Ninth Circuit adopted the \n7  reasoning of Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217 (D.C. Cir. 1988), and concluded that \n8  “despite the [EAA’s] seemingly absolute preclusion of review” Congress intended \n9  courts to review “claims that the Secretary acted in excess of his delegated authority \n10  under the EAA.”  974 F.2d at 1044-45.13   \n11  Plaintiffs, moreover, cannot make expansive use of Dart because the D.C. \n12                                             \nid. at 1044 (“In sum, we believe that the Supreme Court cases upholding judicial \n13 \npreclusion of agency decisions, the language of the APA, and the fact that the EAA \n14  involves foreign policy issues support our conclusion that the EAA’s preclusion of \njudicial review is constitutional.”).  Because the aside about the scope of judicial \n15 \nreview under the EAA and the interpretation of MCorp Financial was not necessary to \n16  the decision, it is properly considered dicta.  See Export Group v. Reef Indus., Inc., 54 \nF.3d 1466, 1472 (9th Cir.1995) (adopting Black's Law Dictionary definition of \n17 \n“dictum” as “an observation or remark ... not necessarily involved in the case or \n18  essential to its determination”) (ellipsis in the original); id. (holding that statements \n“not necessary to the decision” of the case “have no binding or precedential impact”). \n19 \n12 There is some tension between Bozarov’s rejection of this argument and later Ninth \n20 \nCircuit decisions.  See Pinnacle Armor, 648 F.3d at 719 (stating that presumption of \n21  judicial review for administrative action “is overcome” when “Congress expressly \nbars review by statute” (citing MCorp Fin., 502 U.S. at 44)); cf. Nyunt v. Broad. Bd. \n22 \nof Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (holding that the Kyne exception \n23  “applies . . . only where . . . the statutory preclusion of review is implied rather than \nexpress”).  For purposes of this motion, however, Defendants assume that MCorp \n24 \nFinancial permits inquiry into whether the express preclusion provision was intended \n25  to preclude ultra vires review. \n26  13 Plaintiffs err in suggesting that Bozarov and Dart represent a body of caselaw \ndistinct from Kyne and MCorp Financial.  See Ctr. Br. at 14-15.  Dart repeatedly \n27 \nrelied on Kyne “and its progeny,” 848 F.2d at 222-23, 231, and Bozarov treated Kyne \n28  and MCorp Financial as containing the applicable standards.  974 F.2d at 1045. \n  21 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1129   Page 40 of 99\n \n1  Circuit itself has clarified that “Dart stands for the exceedingly narrow proposition \n2  that a statute precluding review is limited by its language.”  McBryde v. Comm. to \n3  Review Cir. Council Conduct & Disability Orders, 264 F.3d 52, 63 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \n4  Importantly, the EAA’s language is quite dissimilar from the language at issue here, \n5  providing that certain orders and decisions of the Secretary “shall be final and is not \n6  subject to judicial review.”  50 U.S.C. app. § 2412(c)(1), (e).14  Such finality \n7  provisions are common in federal statutes and have often been found to reflect an \n8  intent to preclude merits review but not ultra vires review.15  Courts tend to conclude \n9  that such finality clauses are focused on preventing disturbance of the merits decisions \n10  of the agency.  See, e.g., Dart, 848 F.2d at 224, 227 (concluding, with regard to the \n11  EAA’s finality clauses that they “suggest[] that Congress was mainly concerned about \n12  prolonged appeals of claims on the merits . . . .”).  Thus, at bottom, Dart simply states \n13                                             \n14 Section 2412(e) was at issue in Bozarov, and § 2412(c)(1) was at issue in Dart.  \n14 \nDart also addressed another “finality clause” in the EAA, which is not relevant here.  \n15  The EAA excludes the “functions exercised under this Act” from APA review.  50 \nU.S.C. app. § 2412(a).  Dart found this “indirect approach” significant and explained \n16 \nthat the removal of APA review did not dispose of ultra vires review because “[p]rior \n17  to the APA’s enactment . . . courts had recognized the right of judicial review of \nagency actions that exceeded authority,” and “[n]othing in the subsequent enactment \n18 \nof the APA altered [this] doctrine of review.”  848 F.2d at 224.  Because § 102 here \n19  does exactly what Dart noted the EAA did not do—“directly barring review of all . . . \ndecisions,” id., Plaintiffs can find no support from Dart’s analysis of this clause. \n20 \n15 In addition to Dart and Bozarov, Plaintiffs themselves point to two other cases \n21 \napplying ultra vires review despite similar finality clauses.  See, e.g., Lindahl v. OPM, \n22  470 U.S. 768, 773 (1985) (“Questions of dependency and disability arising under this \nsection shall be determined by the Civil Service Commission and its decisions \n23 \nconcerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review.”); \n24  Owens v. Hills, 450 F. Supp. 218, 221 (N.D. Ill. 1978) (“[The Secretary’s] decisions \nregarding . . . the terms and conditions under which [expenditures and payments] are \n25 \napproved or disapproved, shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to \n26  judicial review.”).  Cf. Staacke v. U.S. Sec’y of Labor, 841 F.2d 278, 281 (9th Cir. \n1988) (“The action of the Secretary . . . in allowing or denying a payment under this \n27 \nsubchapter is— . . . (2) not subject to review by another official of the United States or \n28  by a court by mandamus or otherwise.”). \n  22 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1130   Page 41 of 99\n \n1  that courts “look for more explicit congressional intent before inferring that all review \n2  is cut off.”  848 F.2d at 224.  And here, Congress has employed “far more \n3  unambiguous and comprehensive language,” that must be respected.  See Lindahl, 470 \n4  U.S. at 773, 779-80 (“[W]hen Congress intends to bar judicial review altogether, it \n5  typically employs language far more unambiguous and comprehensive than” 5 U.S.C. \n6  § 8347(c)’s provision that “decisions concerning these matters are final and \n7  conclusive and are not subject to review”).16 \n8  In sum, “the clear terms of the statute” control here, and no “policy arguments” \n9  Plaintiffs may wish to make can “override Congress’s clear choice.”  Spiegel, 995 \n10  F.2d at 140.  Put another way, the Act is not “reasonably susceptible to divergent \n11  interpretation,” and the presumption of judicial review is “dislodged.”  Kucana, 558 \n12  U.S. at 251.  Plaintiffs’ non-constitutional challenges to the waiver determination \n13  must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \n14  4.  Plaintiffs have not established that they have statutory rights \nto vindicate through litigation \n15 \nEven if congressional intent to prohibit ultra vires review was not clear and \n16 \nconvincing, Plaintiffs have not established that they satisfy Kyne’s “narrow exception” \n17 \nby making the “two-part showing” required in this Circuit:  (1) that the challenged \n18 \naction “contravene[s] clear and mandatory statutory language” and (2) that “absent \n19 \ndistrict court jurisdiction, [plaintiff would] be wholly deprived of a meaningful and \n20 \n21 \n                                           \n22  16 Similarly, the mere fact that courts have sometimes found ultra vires review \npermitted where merits decisions are committed to agency discretion does not help \n23 \nresolve congressional intent here, where the interpretation of Congress’ expressly \n24  preclusive language is at stake.  See Ctr. Br. at 12-13 (citing Trans Alaska Pipeline \nRate Cases, 436 U.S. 631, 638 n.17 (1978); Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck \n25 \nIndia Reservation v. Bd. of Oil & Gas Conservation, 792 F.2d 782, 791-92 (9th Cir. \n26  1986); Nadler v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 657 F.2d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).  Because \nthe “committed to agency discretion” analysis depends on different factors and has a \n27 \ndifferent scope than the analysis for “statutes precluding judicial review,” such cases \n28  are of little assistance in interpreting the scope of express jurisdictional bars. \n  23 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1131   Page 42 of 99\n \n1  adequate means of vindicating its statutory rights.”  Pacific Maritime Ass’n v. NLRB, \n2  827 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th Cir. 2016).  Plaintiffs’ failure to establish either of these \n3  prongs is fatal to their attempt to invoke ultra vires review.  The second prong is \n4  addressed here, and the first prong is addressed in the following section. \n5  Beginning with Switchmen’s Union, courts have emphasized that this form of \n6  review is appropriate only as a last resort to protect statutory rights.  See MCorp Fin., \n7  502 U.S. at 43 (explaining that the fact that the plaintiff would have been “wholly \n8  deprive[d] . . . of a . . . means of vindicating its statutory rights” was “central to our \n9  decision in Kyne” (emphasis added)); Kyne, 358 U.S. at 189 (engaging in judicial \n10  review where agency action “deprived the professional employees of a ‘right’ assured \n11  to them by Congress” (emphasis added)); Switchmen’s Union, 320 U.S. at 300 \n12  (observing that there would be a strong inference of jurisdiction “[i]f the absence of \n13  jurisdiction . . . meant a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress had \n14  created” (emphasis added)).  Thus, this form of review does not permit the public to \n15  challenge every alleged legal error of an agency.  See, e.g., MCorp Fin., 502 U.S. at \n16  43 (rejecting Fifth Circuit conclusion that Kyne authorizes “judicial review of any \n17  agency action that is alleged to have exceeded the agency’s statutory authority”); \n18  McBryde, 264 F.3d at 63 (“Dart cannot mean that statutory insulation of a specific \n19  type of “order” from review is automatically ineffective whenever the complainant \n20  asserts legal error.”).   \n21  The second prong requires Plaintiffs to identify more than a “statutory \n22  obligation” for the agency, but instead requires them to identify a “statutory right” by \n23  which Plaintiffs are entitled to vindication.  See Calif. Sportfishing Protection Alliance \n24  v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, No. 15-912, 2015 WL 6167521, at *11 & n.8 (E.D. \n25  Cal. Oct. 20, 2015).  Analyzing whether a statute creates individual rights is familiar \n26  from several contexts, including § 1983 cases and private right of action cases.  See \n27  Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, 335 F.3d 932, 936 (9th Cir. 2003) (comparing both \n28 \n  24 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1132   Page 43 of 99\n \n1  legal doctrines and noting that “only violations of rights, not laws, give rise to § 1983 \n2  actions”).  Thus, it is well established that for a statutory right to exist, the statute \n3  itself must direct its benefits to individuals, not merely to the aggregated public or by \n4  commands to the agency.  See, e.g., Logan v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, 722 F.3d 1163, \n5  1171 (9th Cir. 2013) (“Statutes containing general proscriptions of activities or \n6  focusing on the regulated party rather than the class of beneficiaries whose welfare \n7  Congress intended to further do not indicate an intent to provide for private rights of \n8  action.”); Ball v. Rodgers, 492 F.3d 1094, 1109-10 (9th Cir. 2007) (summarizing \n9  several Circuit cases holding that statutory provisions did not create individual rights \n10  enforceable under § 1983 because “they do not mention the service recipients, or refer \n11  to them in the aggregate, or refer to them in the context of describing a more general \n12  institutional policy or practice”); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. \n13  2005) (“The [Supreme] Court repeatedly stressed that it is Congress's use of explicit, \n14  individually focused, rights-creating language that reveals congressional intent to \n15  create an individually enforceable right in a spending statute.”).  Because Plaintiffs \n16  here have identified no statutory right in the text of § 102, it would be an unwarranted \n17  extension of ultra vires review to apply it to the circumstances here. \n18  B.  To the Extent the Court Conducts Ultra Vires Review, It Must \nConclude that the Secretary Did Not Exceed His Statutory Authority \n19 \nIn the alternative, to the extent the Court determines that—despite the plain \n20 \nmeaning of the statute and Congress’ clear intent—courts retain jurisdiction to \n21 \ndetermine whether a waiver determination is ultra vires, the Secretary’s decision here \n22 \nmust be upheld.  Under the extraordinarily deferential ultra vires review standard, the \n23 \nCourt must conclude that the Secretary did not exceed his statutory authority. \n24 \nUltra vires review requires Plaintiffs to show that the challenged action \n25 \n“contravene[s] clear and mandatory statutory language.”  Pacific Maritime Ass’n, 827 \n26 \nF.3d at 1208.  In other words, the agency must be “charged with violating a clear \n27 \nstatutory mandate or prohibition.”  Staacke v.

Plaintiffs cannot show that § 102(a)’s general mandate and § \n102(c)’s waiver provision apply only to the specific \n24  Congressional priorities identified in § 102(b) \n25 \nPlaintiffs primarily argue that § 102(c) waiver authority “is limited to specific \n26 \nborder barriers mandated pursuant to § 102(b).”  Ctr.

By its plain terms, the waiver authority \n5  extends to any construction “under this section,” upon determinations made in the \n6  Secretary’s “sole discretion.” Id.  “[T]his section” unambiguously refers to IIRIRA \n7  § 102 as a whole.  See, e.g., House Office of the Legislative Counsel, Guide to \n8  Legislative Drafting, Section III. Organization within a bill (link) (explaining that \n9  “sections” are the numbered “basic unit[s] of a bill, and thus of an enacted statute” and \n10  that “terminology for referring to units within a section has become highly \n11  standardized”).  When Congress wanted to identify a specific unit within § 102, it did \n12  so in the standardized format.17  Accordingly, the reference to “this section” in \n13  § 102(c)(1) cannot reasonably be read to refer exclusively to subsection 102(b).18  \n14 \n                                           \n15  17 As the Guide to Legislative Drafting explains, § 102(a) is a “subsection,” \n§ 102(b)(1) is a “paragraph,” and § 102(b)(1)(A) is a “subparagraph.”  See id.  \n16 \nCongress followed this approach throughout § 102, both as originally enacted and as \n17  amended.  See, e.g., IIRIRA § 102(b)(1) (“subsection (a)”); id. § 102(b)(1)(C)(ii) \n(“this subparagraph”); id. § 102(b)(1)(C)(ii)(I) (“this subsection”); id. § 102(b)(1)(D) \n18 \n(“this paragraph” “subparagraph (A)”); id. § 102(b)(2) (“subsection (d)” “this \n19  subsection”); id. § 102(b)(3) (“this subsection”); id. § 102(b)(4) (“this subsection” \n“this paragraph”); id. § 102(c)(2)(A) (“paragraph (1)” “this subparagraph”); id. \n20 \n§ 102(c)(2)(B) (“subparagraph (A)”). \n21 \n18 The Center argues that “the terms ‘section’ and ‘subsection are used inconsistently” \n22  and thus the IIRIRA is not a “model of plain language clarity.”  Ctr. Br. at 19.  But its \nexamples from § 102(b)(1)(A)-(C) merely suggest that “carrying out subsection (a)” \n23 \nhas the same import as “carrying out this section.”  This supports Defendants’ position \n24  about the meaning of § 102(a)’s general mandate.  Plaintiffs’ point would only be \nserved if § 102(b) were used interchangeably with “this section.”  Similarly, the \n25 \nCoalition Plaintiffs argue that the deadlines imposed in the current version of \n26  § 102(b)(1) “provide[] the context as to what Congress meant . . . by necessity” in \n§ 102(c).  Coal. Br. at 17.  Again this cuts against Plaintiffs because these deadlines \n27 \nappear only in the latest version of the Act, while the structure they try to explain goes \n28  all the way back to 1996. \n  27 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1135   Page 46 of 99\n \n1  Instead, the waiver authority plainly includes actions pursuant to any part of § 102 that \n2  meet § 102(c)(1)’s criteria. \n3    The most straightforward reading, and the one consistently applied by DHS,19 is \n4  that § 102(a) provides a general mandate to take action, and that § 102(b) identifies \n5  particular congressional priorities to be pursued: \n6  (a) In general.  The Secretary . . . shall take such actions as may be \nnecessary to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the \n7 \nremoval of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the \n8  United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal \nentry into the United States.   \n9 \n(b) Construction of fencing and road improvements along the border. \n10 \n(1) Additional fencing along southwest border \n11 \n(A) Reinforced fencing.

This reading is supported by the natural import of § 102(a)’s broad \n18 \n19 \n                                           \n20  19  DHS has never countenanced the narrow reading proposed by Plaintiffs; even \nthough San Diego was the only location listed in § 102(b) until 2006, DHS \n21 \nconstructed border infrastructure in locations other than San Diego prior to 2006 and \n22  referenced its IIRIRA authority in doing so.  See, e.g., Ex. 19, CBP Finding of No \nSignificant Impact for Infrastructure (Nov. 19, 2003), ECF No. 18-2 (explaining that \n23 \n“the proposed border infrastructure system [for Cochise County, Arizona] has been \n24  planned in compliance with the IIRIRA”); Ex. 11, Cong.

In effect, Congress said to DHS: “However else you apply this \n5  mandate, make sure you complete the projects we have identified in § 102(b).”  And \n6  over the years, Congress has altered its assessment of what those priorities should be, \n7  sometimes specifying specific locations, see Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. \n8  109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 26, 2006); IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, \n9  Title I § 102, 110 Stat. 3009-554 (Sept. 30, 1996), and most recently specifying \n10  aggregate minimum thresholds.  See Dep’t of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n11  2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, Title V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 2007).  \n12  Indeed, Congress, with some regularity, has organized statutes with a general mandate \n13  followed by specific guidance “in carrying out” that grant of authority.  See, e.g., 33 \n14  U.S.C. § 2326(a)(1)(A), (f) (giving Secretary of the Interior general responsibility to \n15  “develop . . . regional sediment management plans” and specifying that “[i]n carrying \n16  out this section, the Secretary shall give priority to [projects] in the vicinity of [eleven \n17  specific locations]”).20 \n18    Plaintiffs, however, argue § 102(a) serves only as a purpose clause and that § \n19  102(b) identifies every way that Congress intends § 102(a) to be implemented.  This \n20  theory is highly implausible and must be rejected for three reasons.  First, when \n21  Congress identifies certain specific applications of a general grant of authority, those \n22  specific requirements cannot generally be understood to prohibit all other applications \n23 \n                                           \n24  20  See also 8 U.S.C. § 1443 (requiring Attorney General to “broadly distribute \ninformation concerning the benefits of [naturalization]” and specifying that “[i]n \n25 \ncarrying out this subsection, the Attorney General shall seek the assistance of . . . \n26 \nrelevant organizations”); 42 U.S.C. § 18352 (giving NASA general responsibility to \n“maximize the productivity and use of the [International Space Station]” and \n27 \nspecifying that “[i]n carrying out subsection (a), NASA shall, at a minimum, \n28 \nundertake the following [three specific tasks]”). \n  29 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1137   Page 48 of 99\n \n1  of the general authority.  See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) \n2  (“We do not read the enumeration of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to \n3  suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.”).  \n4  Arguments similar to Plaintiff’s are routinely rejected.  See, e.g., FTC v. Tarriff, 584 \n5  F.3d 1088, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (rejecting argument “that the term ‘shall’ is a \n6  mandate not only to do one thing but to cease and refrain from doing all others” as a \n7  claim that “borders on sophistry”); Otsuka Pharm. Co. v. Burwell, No. 15-852, 2015 \n8  WL 1962240, at *7 (D. Md. Apr. 29, 2015) (“[Plaintiff] ignores the critical fact that \n9  [the statutory provision] sets forth circumstances where FDA cannot deny approval for \n10  a labeling carve-out; it does not, as [plaintiff] contends, address situations where FDA \n11  can or cannot grant approval.”); Sidney Coal Co. v.

Thus, when faced with the \n14  same argument Plaintiffs make about the interaction between § 102(a) and (b) in 2008, \n15  the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected it because “[t]he statute’s \n16  explicit language does not support such an interpretation.”  Save Our Heritage Org., \n17  533 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (rejecting the notion that “the 2006 amendment to section \n18  102(b) . . . narrow[ed] the Secretary’s authority [under § 102(a)]”); see also id. \n19  (“[T]he Court finds that section 102(a), on its face, authorizes construction of barriers \n20  such as the San Diego Barrier in areas that the Secretary determines are areas of high \n21  illegal entry.”).21   \n22 \n                                           \n21 Plaintiffs repeatedly argue that the Sierra Club decision adopted their reading of the \n23 \ninteraction between § 102(a) and (b).  In rejecting plaintiffs’ first Nondelegation \n24 \nDoctrine challenge, Sierra Club found that Congress had provided sufficient \nboundaries for the waiver authority, observing among other things that this authority \n25 \nwas “only for the narrow purpose of expeditious completion of the Triple Fence \n26 \nauthorized by the IIRIRA.”  2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20.  That observation \nis best understood to merely reference the fact—highlighted by DHS—that the \n27 \ndelegated authority was only being used for a construction project that Congress itself \n28 \nhad specified.  Cf. Defs.’ MTD at 6-7, Doc. No. 36, Sierra Club, et al. v. Ashcroft, et \n  30 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1138   Page 49 of 99\n \n1  Second, the specific terms of the IIRIRA as originally enacted cut sharply \n2  against Plaintiffs’ reading.  Under their reading, Congress had specified the only \n3  location for which the entirety of § 102 could be employed:  constructing “second and \n4  third fences” “along the 14 miles of the international land border . . . starting at the \n5  Pacific Ocean.”  Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(b)(1).  It is not apparent \n6  how the broad mandate to “install additional physical barriers and roads . . . to deter \n7  illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry,” § 102(a), could be fulfilled by that \n8  narrow instruction.22  Instead, § 102(a) would be rendered largely superfluous.  See \n9  Hooks v. Ktsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 F.3d 550, 560 (9th Cir. 2016) (“It is a \n10  cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be \n11  so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be \n12  superfluous, void, or insignificant.”).  Plaintiffs attempt to solve this dilemma with \n13  their reading by suggesting that § 102(a) clauses (such as “areas of high illegal entry”) \n14 \n                                           \n15  al., No. 04-0272 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2005) (arguing that § 102(a) provided a “clearly \ndelineated general policy” and that § 102(b)(1) simply provided “a required method of \n16 \nachieving [§ 102(a)’s] important goal in one geographic area: the construction of \n17  fencing and road improvements in the border area near San Diego”).  Importantly, \nneither party proffered a reading making § 102(b) exclusive.  See, e.g., Pl.’s Opening \n18 \nBr. at 8 n.3, Doc. No. 35, Sierra Club, et al. v. Ashcroft, et al., No. 04-0272 (S.D. Cal. \n19  Oct. 27, 2005) (“The roads and barriers are those in the vicinity of the U.S. border \ngenerally, and along the San Diego-Tijuana border in particular.” (citing § 102(a) & \n20 \n(b))).  But even if Sierra Club did read § 102(b) exclusively, without the benefit of \n21  briefing on the subject, that conclusion was not essential to its reasoning and should \nbe rejected as mistaken. Cf. Save Our Heritage Org., 533 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (finding \n22 \nSierra Club’s reasoning applicable while rejecting an exclusive reading of § 102(b)). \n23 \n22 Defendants do not dispute that Executive Branch authority to build border \n24  infrastructure could be implied from more general laws, such as the Immigration and \nNationality Act of 1952, Pub. L. No. 82-414 § 103, 66 Stat. 163, 174 (June 27, 1952) \n25 \n(codified, as amended, at 8 U.S.C. § 1103).  Indeed, the barriers to be replaced \n26  pursuant to the waiver determinations here were constructed in the “early 1990s,” 82 \nFed. Reg. at 35985, 42830, prior to the passage of § 102.  Section 102(a) serves both \n27 \nto make that authority express and to instruct the Executive Branch to take such action \n28  wherever necessary. \n  31 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1139   Page 50 of 99\n \n1  add meaningful “limits.”  Ctr. Br. at 20.  But they miss the fact that, as originally \n2  enacted, their reading would leave nothing to be limited—Congress had already \n3  specified the exact parameters for the construction.  Thus, § 102(a)’s broad mandate to \n4  identify “areas of high illegal entry” would not only become empty, but also create \n5  substantial confusion.  See Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Am. Guaranty Life Ins. Co., \n6  722 F.2d 1498, 1500 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds by In re McLinn, \n7  739 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Interpretative constructions of a statute which would \n8  render some words surplusage, defy common sense, or lead to mischief or absurdity \n9  are to be avoided.”); see also Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v.

Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 \n12  (2001))).23   \n13  Third, Congress, after identifying only the San Diego project as a priority from \n14  1996 thru 2005, decided to identify many more priorities in 2006 and 2007.  These \n15  subsequent amendments to § 102(b)(1), adopting significantly different requirements \n16  within a fourteen month span, see supra, Background § I (discussing differences \n17  between approaches to § 102(b)), further demonstrate that this subsection merely \n18  identifies reflects Congress’ shifting priorities.  While Plaintiffs argue that § 102 \n19  simply becomes dormant whenever there is no unfinished § 102(b) project, cf. Ctr.

Br. at 18, only for projects identified in \n24  § 102(b)(1).  There is no conflict because § 102(a) can logically be implemented \nwithout relying on the instructions in § 102(b)(2)-(4).  For example, DHS has \n25 \nauthority to acquire easements through 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b), and thus need not rely on \n26  § 102(b)(2), which merely instructs DHS to use that separate authority to “promptly \nacquire such easements as may be necessary to carry out [§ 102(b)].” \n27 \n24 Plaintiffs’ claim that “DHS has fulfilled” the § 102(b)(1) requirements stemming \n28 \nfrom the 2006 and 2007 amendments, Ctr. Br. at 27-28 nn.19-20, Cal.

See infra Arg. § III(B)(2).  Attempting to show that \n2  Defendants’ approach “leads to absurd results,” Plaintiffs turn to wild hypotheticals \n3  about DHS attempting to begin construction “away from the immediate border” or \n4  “build a dam across the Bering Strait.”  Ctr. Br. at 21-22.  But at bottom, Plaintiffs are \n5  simply incredulous that Congress could have meant what the plain text of the statute \n6  indicates—ongoing authority to “bypass any laws for any border barrier or road \n7  construction project,” Ctr. Br. at 21, where necessary to ensure expeditious \n8  construction to deter illegal entry.  Because that plain meaning is not absurd or \n9  inconsistent with the purpose and structure of the statute, the Court cannot conclude—\n10  especially under ultra vires review’s deferential standard—that Plaintiffs’ \n11  interpretation is mandatory. \n12  To the extent that the Court wishes to look beyond the plain meaning of the \n13  statutory text, the legislative history is of no help to Plaintiffs’ interpretation.  First, as \n14  a matter of statutory construction, “[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous . . . \n15  judicial inquiry is complete.”  Aragon-Salazar, 769 F.3d at 704.  But in any event, \n16  Plaintiffs can do no more than show that “the expansion of the waiver authority was \n17  catalyzed by, and intended to address, the delay in completion of the San Diego \n18  fence.”  Ctr. Br. at 25.25  It is no surprise that the sponsors and proponents of the bill \n19  talked about San Diego.  See Ctr. Br. at 23-24 (collecting citations); Coal. Br. at 18-19 \n20 \n                                           \n21  n.13, is irrelevant because DHS does not ground its waiver determination in § 102(b).  \nDefendants do not concede that these requirements have no current significance, but \n22 \ndo not address the matter further here because nothing turns on it. \n23 \n25 The Center’s citation of the title of House bill H.R. 1268, Ctr. Br. at 23, is entitled \n24  to no weight because the language Plaintiff emphasizes was removed from the title in \nthe final legislation, see Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B—a fact pointed out in \n25 \nDefendants’ opening brief to which the Center offered no response.  That title, \n26  therefore does not represent the intent of Congress as a whole.  See also Northstar \nFinancial Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Investments, 615 F.3d 1106, 1120 (9th Cir. 2010) \n27 \n(“[T]he Supreme Court has cautioned that the title of a statute and the heading of a \n28  section cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.”). \n  33 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1141   Page 52 of 99\n \n1  (same).26  But the catalyst for congressional action often does not define the outer \n2  limits of that action.  Here, Congress could easily have crafted language that simply \n3  mandated the relevant construction near San Diego.27  Instead, Congress adopted a far \n4  broader approach by establishing a general mandate in § 102(a) that was not limited to \n5  a single project and by extending § 102(c)’s waiver authority to any actions or \n6  decisions “under this section.”  The conference report—generally considered the best \n7  evidence of legislative intent, see Nw. Forest Resource Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d \n8  825, 835 (9th Cir. 1996)—confirms that § 102 applied beyond San Diego by \n9  explaining that it “provides for construction and strengthening of barriers along U.S. \n10  land borders.”  H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, 2005); see also id. at 171 (describing \n11  both the original and amended waiver authority as “ensur[ing] expeditious \n12  construction of barriers and roads” and “the expeditious construction of security \n13  infrastructure along the border”).  The breadth of § 102(c) was repeatedly noted by \n14  opponents of the bill and was not contradicted by its sponsors.  See, e.g., Ex. 6, 151 \n15  Cong. Rec. H459 (Feb. 9, 2005), ECF No. 18-2 (statement of Cong. Jackson-Lee) \n16  (“[The waiver provision] so broad that it would not just apply to the San Diego border \n17  fence that is the underlying reason for this provision. It would apply any other barrier \n18 \n19                                             \n26 The Coalition Plaintiffs also cite a Congressional Budget Office estimate that was \n20 \nread into the record.  The fact that the waiver provision was estimated to “probably \n21  not impose significant additional costs on state, local, or tribal authorities,” 151 Cong. \nRec. H438 (Feb. 9, 2005), does not indicate that the bill’s text extended no farther \n22 \nthan the San Diego project. \n23 \n27 Indeed, the Center notes that in the “previous House bill,” the “waiver authority \n24  [was] limited to completion of the San Diego border fence.”  Ctr. Br. at 24 n.17 (citing \nH. Amdt. 800).  That amendment to the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act \n25 \nwould have adopted a very specific approach—“the tracts of land described in \n26  subsection (b) shall be exempt from the requirements of the [statutory] provisions \nlisted in subsection (c).”  Ex. 5, 150 Cong Rec. H8898 (Oct. 8, 2004).  This suggests \n27 \nthat Congress, by not carrying forward 2004’s narrow approach, deliberately adopted \n28  the language it chose in 2005. \n  34 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1142   Page 53 of 99\n \n1  or fence that may come about in the future.”).28  These observations, repeated by \n2  opponents at least five times in two days, were not merely “fears and doubts of the \n3  opposition” that can be dismissed, Ctr. Br. at 23 n.16 (quoting Schwegmann Bros. v. \n4  Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394-95 (1951)), but evidence that the broad \n5  import of the plain text was understood during the legislative debate.  From this record \n6  one simply cannot conclude that the triggering events for passage of the waiver \n7  provision—litigation delaying San Diego border infrastructure construction—should \n8  be interpreted to limit the otherwise plain text of the Act.  See United States v. Meeks, \n9  366 F.3d 705, 720 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Given the clarity of the text of the statute and the \n10  ambiguous nature of the legislative history, we see no reason to engage in the crude \n11  guesswork of eschewing the statute's plain language in favor of murky legislative \n12  history.”); Student Loan Fund of Idaho, Inc. v.

H554 (Feb. 10, 2005) (statement of Cong. Harman) \n20  (“[T]he reach is beyond the San Diego border.

H559 (statement of Cong. Udall) (objecting to bill because \n“the language of the bill is not limited to the construction of a fence in [San Diego]” \n25 \nbut instead includes “all laws for all U.S. borders”).  Indeed, members of Congress \n26  similarly noted that the 1996 version of § 102(c) also extended beyond San Diego.  \nSee Ex. 4, 142 Cong. Rec. H11076 (Sept. 25, 1996), ECF No. 18-2 (statement of Rep. \n27 \nSaxton) (“[T]he way this section is written, the exemption applies to the entire border \n28  of the United States, not just the California-Mexico border near San Diego.”).  \n  35 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1143   Page 54 of 99\n \n1  2.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(c) waiver authority has \nunambiguously expired \n2 \nPlaintiffs also advance two arguments that the § 102(c) waiver authority has \n3 \nexpired.  They claim that the phrase “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” in \n4 \n§ 102(c)(1) sets a time limit in relation to the date the waiver provision was enacted in \n5 \n2005.  See Ctr. Br. at 26 (“as soon as possible after the law’s enactment”); see also \n6 \nCal. Br. at 23.  They also argue that § 102(b)(1)(B)’s deadline for completing \n7 \nconstruction in “[p]riority areas” acts “as a de facto sunset clause on the waiver \n8 \nauthority,” and perhaps all of § 102.  Ctr. Br. at 27; Cal. Br. at 21-23.  Neither \n9 \nargument rises to the ultra vires standard, which requires showing that “the agency’s \n10 \nerror is patently a misconstruction of the Act.”  Griffith, 842 F.2d at 493. \n11 \nNothing in the text of the Act demands the conclusion that Congress intended \n12 \nthe waiver authority to sunset.  Looking first at § 102(c)—as enacted in 1996 and \n13 \nexpanded in 2005—the phrase “ensure expeditious construction” most plausibly \n14 \nincludes timely construction after the Secretary (formerly the Attorney General) \n15 \ndetermines that a construction project is “necessary . . . to deter illegal crossings” \n16 \nunder § 102(a).  See § 102(c)(1); see also Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I \n17 \n§ 102(c) (as originally enacted).  Of course, it would also include timely construction \n18 \nof the projects Congress specified in § 102(b), but—so long as § 102(a) provides \n19 \nconstruction authority as established above, see infra Arg. § III(B)(1)—there is no \n20 \ntextual reason to conclude that “expeditious construction” refers only to § 102(b) \n21 \nprojects.  Indeed, as long as Congress continues to appropriate money for such \n22 \nprojects, it stands to reason that CBP should seek to ensure expeditious construction \n23 \nof them pursuant to the terms of § 102.29  That is not to say that all border \n24 \n25                                             \n29 See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-31, Div. F, Title \n26 \nVI, 131 Stat. 135, 434 (May 5, 2017) (appropriating $341 million “to replace \napproximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian and vehicle border fencing \n27 \nalong the southwest border . . . and to add gates to existing barriers” and $77 million \n28 \n“for new border road construction”); DHS Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub.

But § 102(c)(1) means at least that \n2  waivers can be issued when “expeditious construction” of projects identified by the \n3  Secretary or Congress would not occur in the absence of a waiver.   \n4  Plaintiffs’ argument that the December 31, 2008 deadline in § 102(b)(1)(B) \n5  applies generally to § 102(c) or § 102 as a whole is wholly implausible.  Congress \n6  plainly expected construction under § 102 to continue after the end of 2008.  It set this \n7  deadline in December 2007 to ensure that 370 miles of construction in “[p]riority \n8  areas” was completed within one year.  IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(B).  But it simultaneously \n9  required the Secretary to “construct reinforced along not less than 700 miles of the \n10  southwest border.”  Id. § 102(b)(1)(A).  Thus, Congress required that about half of the \n11  specified construction be completed in the first year after enactment.  Because \n12  Congress provided no deadline for completion of the other 330 miles (or more) \n13  “where fencing would be most practical and effective,” id. § 102(b)(1)(A), the plain \n14  implication is that this construction could be completed after 2008.  And there is no \n15  reason that § 102(c) waivers could not be issued to expedite construction for these 330 \n16  miles, let alone construction authorized pursuant to § 102(a).   \n17  There is simply no justification for attempting to turn provisions Congress \n18  designed to maximize DHS’s flexibility,30 especially as compared with very specific \n19  construction locations Congress had specified in 2006, see Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, \n20  into a “de facto sunset clause.”  Ctr. Br. at 27.  Plaintiffs cite no case where a court \n21  found a time limit specified for one component of a statute to implicitly foreclose later \n22 \n                                           \n23  4, 129 Stat. 39, 42 (Mar. 4, 2015) (appropriating $382 million “[f]or expenses for \nborder security fencing, infrastructure, and technology”). \n24 \n30 Plaintiffs’ citation to § 102(b)(1)(B)(i)’s provision that “authority to determine other \n25 \nmileage shall expire on December 31, 2008” is a red herring.  This provision simply \n26  provided the Secretary with flexibility to determine that an amount other than 370 \nmiles (perhaps more, perhaps less) should be used for the priority construction \n27 \nsegment, while emphasizing that any such decision could not delay completion of that \n28  priority construction by December 31, 2008. \n  37 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1145   Page 56 of 99\n \n1  use of the rest of the statute.  Indeed, that would turn ordinary principles of statutory \n2  construction on their heads.  Congress’s choice to include one temporal deadline \n3  suggests that if Congress intended the remaining authority in the statute to sunset, it \n4  would have written that in the text. \n5  And contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims, see, e.g., Coal. Br. at 16, the Secretary’s \n6  necessity determination readily meets the textual standard here.  Congress crafted the \n7  waiver provision because litigation by environmental groups and opposition from \n8  California state agencies was preventing “expeditious construction.”  See, e.g., H.R. \n9  Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) (“Continued delays caused by \n10  litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with respect to \n11  other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security infrastructure \n12  along the border.”); see also 151 Cong. Rec. H557 (Feb. 10, 2005) (statement of \n13  Congressman Royce); Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 8 (statement of Rep. \n14  Hunter).  The vigorous opposition Plaintiffs have displayed here in filing three \n15  lawsuits likewise suggests that construction today would be substantially delayed in \n16  the absence of a waiver.  In addition to the delay of litigation, Congress  was well \n17  aware that the formal procedures for laws like NEPA and the ESA have been used to \n18  significantly delay major infrastructure projects, both public and private, for years \n19  even before the commencement of litigation, in the hope of stopping a given project \n20  altogether.  Plaintiffs have not suggested—and cannot—that expeditious construction \n21  would occur in the absence of a waiver.  \n22  3.  Plaintiff cannot show that § 102(c) unambiguously requires \nthat the Federal Register notice of a waiver determination \n23  include detailed “findings” \n \n24 \nCalifornia argues that the waiver determinations at issue here “are invalid \n25 \nbecause the Secretary failed to make the requisite findings to show that the projects \n26 \ncomply with the requirements of Section 102.”  Cal. Br. at 23.  But nothing in \n27 \n§ 102(c) requires the Secretary to explain the basis for the determination.  Instead, the \n28 \n  38 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1146   Page 57 of 99\n \n1  Act requires only that the Secretary’s decision be “published in the Federal Register,” \n2  § 102(c)(1), which has been done here.  Congress explained that the limited purpose \n3  of the publication requirement was to “ensur[e] appropriate public notice of such \n4  determinations,” H.R. Rep. 109-72, at 170 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.), without any \n5  suggestion that the notice need include a detailed rationale or facilitate judicial review.  \n6  Indeed, two aspects of the IIRIRA compel the conclusion that, unlike ordinary actions \n7  subject to review under the APA, see, e.g., Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bureau of \n8  Land Mgmt., 833 F.3d 1136, 1150 (9th Cir. 2016), the agency need not provide a \n9  rationale sufficient to enable arbitrary and capricious review.  First, Congress barred \n10  all non-constitutional claims.  See supra Arg. § I.  Challenges to the Secretary’s \n11  application of the statutory criteria are not constitutional claims, thus the rationale for \n12  that application is not necessary to facilitate the limited judicial review available.  \n13  Second, the Act makes clear that the determination is made “in [the] Secretary’s sole \n14  discretion.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1); see also Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, \n15  345 F.3d 683, 690 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that “many of the other provisions of the \n16  IIRIRA . . . do in fact specify that particular decisions are within the sole or \n17  unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General”).  Thus, even if Congress had not \n18  expressly barred judicial review, the waiver determination itself would not be subject \n19  to judicial review because it is “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n20  § 701(a)(2); cf. Great Old Broads For Wilderness v. Kempthorne, 452 F. Supp. 2d 71, \n21  81 (D.D.C. 2006) (concluding § 701(a)(2) applied “where Congress provided for \n22  “determin[ation of] the priority and timing for completing required environmental \n23  analysis of grazing allotments” “in [the Secretary’s] sole discretion”).  It is clear that \n24  Congress intended the Secretary’s rationale to be unreviewable.   \n25  Ultra vires review should, at most, reach no further than confirming that the \n26  Secretary made the determination on the basis of the statutory criteria.  See IIRIRA \n27  § 102(c)(1) (granting the Secretary authority “to waive all legal requirements such \n28 \n  39 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1147   Page 58 of 99\n \n1  Secretary . . . determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers \n2  and roads under this section”).  See Staacke, 841 F.2d at 281 (looking only for \n3  violation of “a clear statutory mandate or prohibition”); Am. Airlines, 176 F.3d at 293 \n4  (“a plain violation of an unambiguous and mandatory provision of the statute”).  Here, \n5  it is plain that the Secretary and Acting Secretary’s determinations were made on the \n6  basis of the statutory criteria.  Each waiver determination concluded: \n7    that the specific project areas are “area[s] of high illegal entry,” \nsee 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (“I determine that the following area . . \n8 \n. within the United States Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector . . . is \n9  an area of high illegal entry: Starting at the Pacific Ocean and \nextending to approximately one mile east of Border Monument \n10 \n251.”); id. at 42830 (“I determine that the following area . . . \n11  within the United States Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector is an \narea of high illegal entry . . . : Starting at the Calexico West Land \n12 \nPort of Entry and extending approximately three miles \n13  westward.”); \n14    that the projects “will further Border Patrol’s ability to deter and \nprevent illegal crossings;” 82 Fed. Reg. at 35984, 42830; \n15 \n  that there “is presently a need to construct . . . the infrastructure \n16 \nprojects described in Section 1,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985, 42830 \n17 \n  that these projects involve “physical barriers and roads” as those \n18 \nterms are used in the Act, id.; and  \n19 \n  that it is “necessary that I exercise the authority that is vested in \n20  me by section 102(c)” in order to “ensure the expeditious \nconstruction of the barriers and roads,” id.   \n21 \nThese findings are sufficient to satisfy ultra vires review.  And these determinations, \n22 \nwell within the Secretary’s expertise and delegated “sole discretion,” should not be \n23 \nsubject to judicial second-guessing. \n24 \n  Plaintiffs cite no caselaw requiring more from an agency pursuant to ultra vires \n25 \nreview.  Instead, they rely exclusively on cases applying the APA’s arbitrary and \n26 \ncapricious standard.  See Organized Village of Kake v. USDA, 795 F.3d 956, 966-67 \n27 \n(9th Cir. 2015) (invalidating regulation for which agency had failed to provide “good \n28 \n  40 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1148   Page 59 of 99\n \n1  reasons” because “[u]nexplained inconsistency between agency actions is a reason for \n2  holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change”); Dickson v. \n3  Secretary of Defense, 68 F.3d 1396, 1405 (D.C.

See, e.g., Dubbs v. CIA, 866 F.2d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir. 1989) \n8  (characterizing Supreme Court decision to hold that “judicial review under an \n9  ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard to be precluded because” the “committed to agency \n10  discretion” exception to APA review applied); Tashima v.

Plaintiffs cannot show that key statutory terms unambiguously \npreclude the waiver determinations at issue here \n15 \nFinally, Plaintiffs—under the guise of ultra vires review—press the Court to \n16 \nengage in ordinary APA review of numerous phrases in § 102.

Br. at 8-11, 14-16.32  None of the statutory phrases \n18 \nunambiguously preclude the use of § 102(c) waiver authority for the construction \n19 \nprojects at issue here. \n20 \n21                                             \n31 Gonzalez v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 (2006) is irrelevant because it is not about the \n22 \nsufficiency of agency findings.  Instead, the passage California cites merely addresses \n23  whether an agency has “special authority to interpret its own words” when its \nregulation “merely . . . paraphrase[s] the statutory language.”  Id. at 257. \n24 \n32 As discussed above, the Coalition Plaintiffs also seek to press some of these \n25 \narguments as a matter of ordinary APA review, which cannot be correct because the \n26  only final agency action being challenged is the very issuance of a waiver \ndetermination Congress has exempted from non-constitutional judicial review.  See \n27 \nsupra, Arg. § III(A)(1) n.5.  Those arguments are addressed here through the lens of \n28  ultra vires review. \n  41 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1149   Page 60 of 99\n \n1  a.  “Additional barriers and roads” \n2  Plaintiffs argue that the § 102(a)’s provision for “install[ing] additional physical \n3  barriers” exclusively means “installing fencing in areas where none existed at the \n4  time.”  Cal. Br. at 19-20; see also Coal. Br. at 14 (a “replacement fence . . . is not an \n5  ‘additional physical barrier’”).33  This cramped reading of the Act is not the best \n6  reading, let alone the exclusive reading.   \n7  Section 102(a) gives the Secretary authority “to take such actions as may be \n8  necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of \n9  obstacles to detection of illegal entrants).”  Plaintiffs cannot show that their strict \n10  dichotomy between “replacement” and “additional” is required.  See Coal. Br. at 14 \n11  (“‘[R]eplacement’ results in no net gain (no ‘addition’) because the new barrier is \n12  merely a substitute or successor to the fence it is replacing.”).  Dictionary definitions \n13  of “additional,” include flexible words such as “more,” “extra,” and “added.”  See, \n14  e.g., Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989 (“Existing in addition, coming by way of \n15  addition; added”); Websters New World College Dictionary, 3rd ed. 1988 (“added, \n16  more, extra”); Random House College Dictionary, revised ed. 1980 (“added, \n17  supplementary”); cf. Cal. Br. at 20 (quoting similar definition from Webster’s 3d New \n18  Int’l Dictionary, 2002).  Congress itself indicated that adding features to existing \n19  infrastructure comes within the scope of § 102(a) when it included installation of \n20  “lighting, cameras, and sensors” among the construction activities to be performed \n21  “[i]n carrying out” § 102(a).  See IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A). \n22  Here, Defendants are replacing fencing installed in the 1990s with significantly \n23  taller barriers that also have other features making them more operationally effective.  \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n33 While the Center’s complaint raised similar arguments, see, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ \n26  134, ECF No. 16, the Center offered no response to Defendants’ arguments on this \npoint and did not press such a theory in its summary judgment brief.  Accordingly, the \n27 \nCenter has abandoned this claim.  See Herrera v. Allianceone Receivable Mgmt., Inc., \n28  No. 14-1844, 2016 WL 7048318, at *6 n.5 (S.D. Cal.

Reg. at 42830 (“The existing fourteen foot, landing mat style \n2  fencing will be replaced with an eighteen to twenty-five foot barrier that employs a \n3  more operationally effective design that is intended to meet Border Patrol’s \n4  operational requirements.”).34  Plaintiffs may not rely on the narrowest possible \n5  interpretation of the word “additional” to overturn Congress’s expansive legislative \n6  intent.  As the legislative history makes clear, the term readily includes several types \n7  of addition: \n8    construction where no barrier currently exists on the border, see \nH.R. Rep. 104-828, at 200 (Sept. 24, 1996) (Conf. Rep.) (calling \n9 \n“for extension of the new fencing” for the full 14 miles near San \n10  Diego);  \n11    new barriers parallel to existing ones, see id. (calling for \nconstruction of “second and third fences” near San Diego); Cal. Br. \n12 \nat 19 (conceding that “Congress sought to add new layers of \n13  fencing”); \n14    adding “more” to an existing barrier, e.g., making it higher or more \nresistant to illegal entry, see H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 170 (May 3, \n15 \n2005) (Conf. Rep.) (explaining that § 102 “provides for \n16  construction and strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders” \n(emphasis added)); Ex. 9, 152 Cong. Rec.

Because—under Plaintiffs’ view—DHS could not use § 102 authority to \n2  enhance any barrier or road once constructed, DHS would need to accurately project \n3  its needs far into the future before undertaking construction.  This is especially \n4  troubling for areas where DHS could not construct or modify infrastructure at all \n5  without waiver authority.  See, e.g., Walls & Waivers Hearing, 110th Cong. 17 \n6  (explaining that in “national wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” other statutes \n7  prohibit the Department of the Interior from “permitting the construction of certain \n8  border security infrastructure” in the absence of a waiver).  Congress is well aware \n9  that border security addresses a dynamic environment, with evolving threats and ever-\n10  changing transit patterns.  Accordingly, it is implausible that Congress gave DHS only \n11  one shot at improving border security at any given location under § 102. \n12    Thus, with both text and legislative history against them, Plaintiffs cannot show \n13  that the replacement projects at issue here clearly fall outside the scope of the statutory \n14  text.  See Griffith, 842 F.2d at 494 (rejecting ultra vires challenge where agency’s \n15  approach was “not the only possible interpretation of the statutory language” but \n16  “surely a colorable one”).       \n17  b.  “Areas of high illegal entry” \n18  Plaintiffs also challenge the Secretary’s determination that these sectors and \n19  project areas are “areas of high illegal entry.”  Ctr. Br. at 28; Coal. Br. at 8-10, 14-15; \n20  Cal. Br. at 16-18.  Plaintiffs do not employ tools of statutory construction in seeking \n21  to discern what “high illegal entry” means, but instead argue that the substantial \n22  decline in the apprehension of illegal aliens along the border in general and in the San \n23  Diego and El Centro Sectors in particular preclude any finding of continued high \n24  illegal entry.  See id.  This argument should be rejected. \n25  Congress set no specific threshold for “high illegal entry.”  In the most recent \n26  amendment to § 102, however, Congress did make clear that one of the Act’s purposes \n27  is “to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border.”  § \n28 \n  44 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1152   Page 63 of 99\n \n1  102(b)(1)(D); see also id. § 102(b)(1)(A) (“to gain operational control of the \n2  southwest border”).  And Congress has expansively defined “operational control” of \n3  the border—“the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including . . \n4  . unlawful aliens, . . . narcotics, and other contraband.”  Pub. L. No. 109-367 § 2(b) \n5  (emphasis added).35  Plaintiffs’ statistical arguments cannot be reconciled to these \n6  Congressional goals.  Before Congress amended § 102 in 2006 and 2007, \n7  apprehensions of illegal aliens had fallen significantly from their levels in the 1990s \n8  and early 2000s.  See, e.g., Coal. Ex. 1 at 1, ECF No. 29-3 (showing that by 2006, \n9  apprehensions in the San Diego sector had fallen from more than 480,000 to less than \n10  150,000, and that apprehensions across the southwest border had fallen almost thirty \n11  percent).  Yet Congress, when it twice amended § 102 at that time, did not suggest \n12  that there was no longer “high illegal entry” along the border.  Instead, Congress \n13  provided more resources and requirements to address what it viewed as an ongoing \n14  problem.  This suggests that it would be unwarranted for a court to set some absolute \n15  threshold for “high illegal entry” based on a comparison to the flow of illegal \n16  immigration at the time the statute was enacted or amended.36 \n17                                             \n35 Congress’s definition of “operational control” demonstrates that Plaintiffs err in \n18 \nsuggesting that “high illegal entry” is limited to the crossing of individual illegal \n19  aliens into the United States.  See Cal. Br. at 17 (disputing that “the amount of drugs \nseized correlates with the number of illegal entries”).  Congress has made clear that \n20 \nsuch entries include “narcotics, and other contraband.”  Pub. L. No. 109-367 § 2(b). \n21 \n36 It should also be noted that apprehension data is an incomplete measure of illegal \n22  entry.  See, e.g., DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Efforts by DHS to Estimate \nSouthwest Border Security between Ports of Entry at 1 (Cal. Ex. 8, ECF No. 30-5) \n23 \n(noting that “it is difficult to precisely quantify illegal flows because illegal border \n24  crossers actively seek to evade detection, and some flows are undetected”); id. at 15 \n(noting that to compare apprehension data from year to year or location by location, \n25 \none has to assume that the “apprehension rate is constant,” i.e., that similar \n26  percentages of those who attempt to cross are apprehended).  Thus, the number of \napprehensions in the sectors at issue here does not reflect all illegal entries in those \n27 \nsectors.  DHS is seeking to reintroduce operational control as an enforcement \n28  measurement, with subsidiary metrics.  See id. at 18. \n  45 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1153   Page 64 of 99\n \n1  Measured against Congress’s definition of “operational control,” Plaintiffs \n2  cannot establish that these are not areas of high illegal entry.  The Secretary noted \n3  publically-available statistics showing that the San Diego and El Centro Sectors \n4  remain a problem, with “over 31,000 illegal aliens” and “over 19,000 illegal aliens,” \n5  apprehended in those sectors respectively in fiscal year 2016, and large amounts of \n6  illegal drugs seized.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35984, 42830.  Both sectors are in the upper \n7  third of sectors nationwide, as ranked by number of apprehensions.  See Ex. 18, U.S. \n8  Border Patrol, Sector Profile – Fiscal Year 2016 (link), ECF No. 18-2 (fourth and \n9  seventh, respectively).  These facts certainly exceed whatever lower threshold could \n10  be set for “high illegal entry.”37  And the legislative history for the Act demonstrates \n11  that Congress was well aware that this corridor between San Diego and Tijuana has \n12  long been a source of significant illegal entry into the United States.  See, e.g., 151 \n13  Cong. Rec. H554-555 (statements of Cong. Hunter, Cong. Sensenbrenner); Ex. 5, 150 \n14  Cong. Rec. H8899 (Oct. 8, 2004) (statement of Cong. Hunter), ECF No 18-2. \n15  Plaintiffs also object to the use of sector-wide statistics to support the finding of \n16  high illegal entry.  See, e.g., Cal. Br. at 17 (demanding “factual findings to \n17  demonstrate that these two areas are priority areas with the . . . sectors”).  But nothing \n18  in the Act requires the Secretary to publish more granular data to prove that the \n19  finding committed to his or her “sole discretion” was warranted.  As explained above, \n20  the Federal Register notice provided for by § 102(c) need only state the Secretary’s \n21  determination, not exhaustively set out the information upon which it was based.  See \n22  supra, Arg. § III(B)(3).  Thus, the burden is on Plaintiffs to show that the Secretary’s \n23  conclusion was clearly improper.  And this they cannot do.  Congress itself frequently \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n37 Plaintiffs also suggest that “high illegal entry” could be measured relative to “the \n26  current rates of illegal entry across all southwest border sectors.”  Cal. Br. at 18.  This \nappears to suggest that DHS should only be able to apply § 102 to the sector with the \n27 \nhighest rate of illegal entry.  But the statutory term is “high” not “highest,” making \n28  such an approach unwarranted. \n  46 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1154   Page 65 of 99\n \n1  referred to sector-wide statistics in discussing the need for such projects.  See, e.g., \n2  152 Cong. Rec. S9873 (Sept. 21, 2006) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (citing sector wide \n3  statistics in support of Secure Fence Act); 151 Cong. Rec. H453 (Feb. 9, 2005) \n4  (statement of Cong. Hart) (relying on San Diego Sector-wide statistics to support \n5  completion of three mile segment of border barrier under REAL ID Act); id. H467 \n6  (statement of Cong. Cox) (same); id. H471 (statement of Cong. Bono) (same).  Sector-\n7  wide data has generally been considered the most reliable because entry attempts shift \n8  dynamically within a sector based on many factors, including the allocation of \n9  enforcement resources.  See, e.g., Ex. 11, CRS, Border Security: Barriers Along the \n10  U.S. Int’l Border at 12-13 (Mar. 16, 2009), ECF No. 18-2 (noting that evidence \n11  suggests “that as enforcement efforts increased in the two westernmost stations [in the \n12  San Diego Sector] . . . the flow of illegal migration pushed eastward to the other \n13  stations in the San Diego sector”).  And when apprehensions occur significantly \n14  inland from the border, it can be difficult to determine precisely where the crossings \n15  occurred.  Plaintiffs’ efforts to discredit the Secretary’s conclusion that the project \n16  areas remain areas of high illegal entry fall far short.  They cannot contradict that \n17  conclusion by pointing to data from two Border Patrol stations from 1992-2004.  See \n18  Cal. Br. at 18 (citing Cal. Ex. 22 at 10-15).  This data is more than ten years old, and \n19  does not even include the entire San Diego project area.38  See CBP, Chula Vista \n20  Station (Mar. 11, 2014) (link) (attached as Ex. 21) (explaining that the Chula Vista \n21  Station’s responsibility extends only to the Otay Mesa port of entry, and thus does not \n22  include the easternmost portion of the project area).  Nor can statistics about \n23  Defendants’ deployment of Border Patrol agents, see Coal. Br. at 9, conclusively show \n24                                             \n38 The Coalition Plaintiffs assert without evidence that “there should be little to no \n25 \nillegal crossings occurring in these areas” due to the existing fences.  See Coal. Br. at \n26  14.  But reports cited by Plaintiffs demonstrate that illegal crossings do occur at \nfenced locations and that the legacy landing mat fencing results in more illegal entry \n27 \nthan more recent barrier styles.  See GAO Report 17-331 at 48 (Cal. Ex. 1 at 12, ECF \n28  No. 30-4). \n  47 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1155   Page 66 of 99\n \n1  that areas with relatively lower deployments do not have high illegal entry—human \n2  resources are only one aspect of DHS’s border response.  And the “apprehension rate” \n3  data Plaintiffs cite does not support their conclusion that these sectors had better rates \n4  “than any other southwest sector,” Coal. Br. at 9,39 let alone that the sectors can be \n5  written off as no longer having any areas of “high illegal entry.”  In sum, the \n6  Secretary’s determinations should be respected and left undisturbed. \n7  c.  “Deter illegal crossings” \n8  The way Plaintiffs attempt to thwart Congressional intent is especially on \n9  display in their argument that the Court should second-guess the Secretary’s \n10  conclusion that the projects “will further Border Patrol’s ability to deter and prevent \n11  illegal crossings.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35984, 42830.  Plaintiffs criticize any further use \n12  of physical barriers, claiming that certain data “suggest[s] that barriers may not be the \n13  most effective means of preventing illegal immigration.”  Coal. Br. at 10.  Plaintiffs \n14  thus ask the Court to step outside the judicial role and weigh the wisdom of \n15  Congress’s approach to border security.  It cannot be that, in weighing whether an \n16  action within the agency’s expertise and sole discretion is ultra vires, a court can rely \n17  on such nebulous factors.  See, e.g., Pacific Maritime Ass’n, 827 F.3d at 1208 (holding \n18  that challenged action must “contravene clear and mandatory statutory language”). \n19  Plaintiffs also claim that the border wall prototypes which have been \n20  constructed will not deter illegal entry.  In this they simply contradict the Secretary’s \n21  conclusion that these prototypes serve two legitimate purposes under § 102—(1) the \n22  prototypes are “physical barriers” that are intended “to deter illegal crossings” in the \n23 \n                                           \n24  39 This assertion in the Coalition Plaintiffs’ brief is not supported by their Statement of \nFact No. 35, which instead addressed only apprehension rates in “zones with no \n25 \nfencing.”  That measure is not the one most relevant here where fencing is involved.  \n26  Regardless, an “apprehension rate” describes the degree to which it is known or \nestimated that illegal entrants were captured, and Plaintiffs’ own data suggest that that \n27 \neven in the best case scenario, a significant percentage of entrants evade capture and \n28  get through. \n  48 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1156   Page 67 of 99\n \n1  area, see 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (stating that the location and “robust physical \n2  characteristics” of the prototypes “are intended to deter illegal crossings”), and (2) \n3  they are actions the Secretary deemed necessary to prepare for future installation of \n4  barriers.  See id. (“to evaluate various design features for potential inclusion in a \n5  border wall standard . . . [to be] utilized as a part of border wall construction going \n6  forward”).  Section 102 makes clear that the Secretary’s authority encompasses more \n7  than the “physical barriers and roads” themselves, both by including whatever \n8  “actions . . . may be necessary” for their installation and by illustrating the point with \n9  an action that is not installation or construction at all—“removal of obstacles to \n10  detection.”  Id.  Plaintiffs’ own speculation about whether, due to the spacing between \n11  the prototypes, they will serve a deterrent effect, see Coal. Br. at 15; Cal. Br. at 16 \n12  n.11, is far from sufficient to overturn the Secretary’s determination on ultra vires \n13  review. \n14  d.  “Most practical and effective” \n15  California errs in suggesting that Congress—in directing DHS to determine \n16  where fencing “would be most practical and effective” for purposes of the projects \n17  specified in § 102(b)(1) in December 2007—was creating a limitation on the broad \n18  mandate of § 102(a).  See supra Arg. § III(B)(1); Cal. Br. at 20-21.  Nor can they \n19  show that such a standard could be judicially enforceable under ultra vires review.  \n20  Indeed, Congress emphasized that it was for the Secretary to determine whether “the \n21  use or placement of such resources is . . . the most appropriate means to achieve and \n22  maintain operational control over the international border at such location.”  IIRIRA § \n23  102(b)(1)(D).  Lastly, California points to nothing which suggests that further \n24  construction would be impractical or ineffective in these particular locations.  Instead, \n25  it points to general comments made by then-Secretary Kelly in a news interview and \n26  the fact that California locations were not selected for additional construction in 2007 \n27 \n28 \n  49 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1157   Page 68 of 99\n \n1  and 2008.  See Cal. Br. at 21.40  These points cannot overturn the Secretary’s exercise \n2  of delegated discretion. \n3  e.  “Consultation” \n4  The Coalition Plaintiffs also argue that “unless the Secretary has consulted with \n5  the parties identified in subsection 102(b)(1)(C), the waiver [authority] is \n6  unavailable.”  Coal. Br. at 6, 10.  This argument fails as a textual matter.  Nothing in \n7  the waiver provision is expressly or implicitly dependent on completion of the \n8  consultation requirement.  Nor is the waiver determination itself a subject of the \n9  intended consultation.  After all, Congress expressly stated that the waiver \n10  determination was a matter of the Secretary’s “sole discretion.”  IIRIRA § 102(c).  \n11 \n12                                             \n40 Defendants do not “concede[] that these sectors have the lowest priority for \n13 \ninfrastructure projects,” or that DHS “does not have an high priority infrastructure \nneeds in either the San Diego or El Centro sectors.”  Cal. Br. at 21.  California bases \n14 \nthis claim on a predecisional, internal document that predates that waiver \n15 \ndetermination by five months and does not necessarily reflect the Secretary’s ultimate \nassessment.  See Cal. Ex. 9 (presentation marked as “PREDECISIONAL/FOR \n16 \nOFFICIAL USE ONLY” and dated March 27, 2017).  It is a privileged document that \n17 \nis not part of the administrative record and should not be considered here.  See, e.g., \n18  San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 789 F.2d 26, \n44-45 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc) (refusing to consider predecisional, deliberative \n19 \nmaterial); Forest Guardians v. Kempthorne, No. 06-2560, 2008 WL 11337359, at *1 \n20  (S.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2008) (noting, without objection, that the agency withheld from the \nadministrative record certain “documents under the deliberative process privilege”).  \n21 \nRegardless, that document merely shows that these sectors as a whole were proposed \n22  as “moderate” priorities, rather than “high” or “very high” priorities, Cal.

Then-Secretary \n24  Kelly’s television interview from a location near El Paso, Texas, simply stated that \n“here” the agency found the existing fencing to be “remarkably effective.”  See Fox \n25 \nNews, Transcript: Sec.

The Secretary did not talk \n27 \nspecifically about the San Diego or El Centro Sectors, let alone whether those areas \n28  may or may not be a priority.   \n  50 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1158   Page 69 of 99\n \n1  Thus, failure to satisfy the consultation requirement cannot be treated as a condition \n2  precedent that can be the basis for overturning a waiver on ultra vires review.   \n3  Nor can Plaintiffs separately enforce the provision because it does not give rise \n4  to a private cause of action.  See IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(C)(ii) (stating that consultation \n5  requirement does not “create . . . any right of action for a . . . person or entity affected \n6  by this subsection”); Texas Border Coal. v. Napolitano, 614 F. Supp. 2d 54, (D.D.C. \n7  2009) (concluding that “no private right of action or private remedy has been created” \n8  to enforce this section).  And here, where judicial review of “any actions undertaken” \n9  pursuant the Secretary’s waiver authority is strictly limited, IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A), \n10  Plaintiffs have no claim under the APA to challenge how the construction that is \n11  subject to the waiver is completed. \n12  Regardless, the consultation requirement should be tailored to the \n13  circumstances of each project.  See IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(C)(i) (focusing on “the \n14  communities and residents located near the sites at which such fencing is to be \n15  constructed”).  For the construction of the prototypes on a small section of federal \n16  land, DHS determined that because there would be no significant impacts to \n17  environmental or cultural resources, the need for consultation was minimal as well.  \n18  See, e.g., Memorandum, Construction and Evaluation of Border Wall Prototypes, U.S. \n19  Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, California at 6 (Sept. 25, 2017) (concluding, after \n20  expert survey, that prototypes project “is not likely to have any impact on cultural and \n21  historical resources”); id. at 5-6 (concluding that “environmental impacts are not \n22  expected to result from the Project” and addressing the likely effect on five sensitive \n23  species located in the region).  For the barrier replacement projects, the assessment of \n24  appropriate consultation is ongoing.  Thus, Defendants have not violated the \n25  consultation requirement even if it were judicially enforceable.     \n26  In sum, each of Plaintiff’s ultra vires theories fails to justify judicial intrusion \n27  on a decision Congress committed to the Secretary’s “sole discretion.”  \n28 \n  51 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1159   Page 70 of 99\n \n1  IV.  PLAINTIFFS’ CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS FAIL \n2  Congress expressly provided district courts authority to review constitutional \n3  claims regarding “any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of \n4  Homeland Security pursuant to [§ 102(c)(1)].”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(2)(A).  Under \n5  various constitutional theories, Plaintiffs primarily challenge Congress’ choices to (1) \n6  permit the Secretary to determine which laws to waive and (2) strictly limit judicial \n7  review of such waiver determinations.  However, the approach taken by Congress \n8  does not violate any constitutional requirement and Defendants are, accordingly, \n9  entitled to summary judgment. \n10  A.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Article I § 1 \n11  Plaintiffs claim that § 102(c) unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to \n12  the DHS Secretary.  See Ctr. Br. at 35-37; Coal. Br. at 20-27; Cal. Br. at 30-35.  The \n13  nondelegation doctrine is rooted in “the notion of separation of powers,” but few laws \n14  violate it; the Supreme Court “has only twice invalidated legislation under this \n15  doctrine, the last time being [more than] seventy-five years ago.”  In re Nat’l Security \n16  Agency Telecomm. Records Litig. (hereinafter “Telecomm. Records”), 671 F.3d 881, \n17  895 (9th Cir. 2011).  Every court to consider a nondelegation challenge to § 102(c) \n18  has rejected it, beginning with a decision in this district.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. \n19  Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *16-25; see also County of El Paso, 2008 WL 4372693, at *2-\n20  4; Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 63-64; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. \n21  2d at 126-29.  Plaintiffs’ claims must likewise fail. \n22  It is well established that, because Congress could not function without the \n23  ability to delegate, Congress may authorize another branch of government to carry out \n24  its law-making authority so long as it provides “an intelligible principle to which the \n25  person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.”  J.W. Hampton, Jr. Co. v. \n26  United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  To provide a constitutionally permissible \n27  “intelligible principle,” Congress need only “clearly delineate[] the general policy, the \n28 \n  52 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1160   Page 71 of 99\n \n1  public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.” \n2  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372-73 (1989).   \n3  Plaintiffs claim that Congress failed to delineate a “general policy” to guide the \n4  delegated authority or establish sufficient “boundaries” for it.41  Plaintiffs are \n5  mistaken.  Congress has provided ample guidance about the policy the Secretary is to \n6  be guided by in exercising the waiver authority.  Section 102(a) delineates a “general \n7  policy” of installing infrastructure to “deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal \n8  entry into the United States,” which § 102(c) incorporates by tying the waiver \n9  authority to “expeditious construction of barriers and roads under this section.”  This \n10  establishes a policy to guide the Secretary:  that improving border protection by \n11  expediting the construction of necessary barriers and roads is a high Congressional \n12  priority.  See, e.g., Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20 (concluding that \n13  § 102’s clearly delineated general policy is “improvement of U.S. border protection” \n14  which is “a high congressional priority”); Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at \n15  127 (finding a clearly delineated general policy “to expeditiously ‘install additional \n16  physical barriers and roads . . . to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal \n17  entry’”).42  The Coalition Plaintiffs criticize Defenders of Wildlife by claiming that it \n18  “conflated the policy of the authorization with the authorization itself,” thus making a \n19  “circular error.”  Coal. Br. at 23.  But they cite no authority for this point.  And neither \n20 \n                                           \n21  41 Plaintiffs thus concede that the IIRIRA sufficiently specifies who is to “apply” the \ngeneral policy—“the Secretary of Homeland Security.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1); see, e.g., \n22 \nCoal. Br. at 22 (stating that “the Government can . . . point with clarity to the second \n23  element – the public agency applying the legislation”). \n24  42 The Coalition Plaintiffs suggest that these “district courts . . . could not agree on” \nthe general policy established by § 102.  Coal. Br. at 22-23.  But there is no conflict \n25 \nbetween the statements of general policy.  One is simply a more specific version of the \n26  other.  Indeed, later courts found no conflict between them.  See County of El Paso, \n2008 WL 4372693, at *3-4 (adopting both Sierra Club’s and Defenders of Wildlife’s \n27 \nanalysis); Save Our Heritage Org., 533 F. Supp. 2d at 63 & n.2 (adopting Defenders \n28  of Wildlife’s analysis and noting Sierra Club’s). \n  53 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1161   Page 72 of 99\n \n1  logic nor precedent require Congress’ policy guidance to be entirely distinct from the \n2  scope of the authorization. \n3  Congress has also provided specific boundaries for its delegated authority.  The \n4  authority may only be exercised to “waive all legal requirements [the] Secretary . . . \n5  determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n6  under this section.”  IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) (emphasis added).  The first boundary is \n7  geographic.  Waivers may only be issued in connection with construction “in the \n8  vicinity of the United States border.”  Id. § 102(a) (incorporated by the “under this \n9  section” cross-reference).43  The second boundary is temporal necessity.  Waivers may \n10  only be issued where “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” at those \n11  locations.  Id. § 102(c)(2).  See Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 127 \n12  (concluding that Congress provided a sufficient boundary by instructing that “the \n13  Secretary may waive only those laws that he determine necessary to ensure \n14  expeditious construction”). \n15  Plaintiffs nevertheless claim that Congress has failed to provide “substantive \n16  boundaries as to which laws should be waived under what conditions or when.”  Coal. \n17 \n                                           \n18  43 In Sierra Club, the plaintiffs were challenging the application of waiver authority to \na construction project Congress had specifically instructed be completed—“this \n19 \nparticular 14-mile California border Triple Fence.”  Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. \n20  LEXIS 44244, at *21.  Accordingly, that court found it easy to conclude that the \nSecretary was not outside the boundaries for exercise of the waiver authority.  As \n21 \ndiscussed above, Sierra Club should not be read to suggest that only the projects \n22  specified by Congress in § 102(b) are authorized under § 102(a).  See supra Arg. \n§ III(B)(1).  Similarly, Congress’ particular identification of the San Diego border area \n23 \nat the time of the Sierra Club decision should be considered a sufficient basis for \n24  rejection of those plaintiffs’ non-delegation theory, but not an essential one.  Cf. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128 (paraphrasing Sierra Club’s boundary \n25 \nanalysis as involving expeditious completion “of the border fences authorized by \n26  IIRIRA in areas of high illegal entry”); see also Save Our Heritage, 533 F. Supp. 2d at \n61 (finding no unconstitutional delegation for construction not encompassed by \n27 \n§ 102(b) after expressly rejecting argument that “section 102(b) . . . narrow[ed] the \n28  Secretary’s authority . . . derived from section 102(a)”). \n  54 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1162   Page 73 of 99\n \n1  Br. at 23.  Plaintiffs cite no authority for this supposed implementation of Mistretta’s \n2  “boundaries” requirement.  Indeed, their proposal is strikingly similar to one rejected \n3  by the Supreme Court.  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001) \n4  (rejecting lower court’s approach, noting that “even in sweeping regulatory schemes \n5  we have never demanded . . . that statutes provide a determinate criterion for saying \n6  how much of the regulated harm is too much”).  Nor does the “intelligible principle” \n7  caselaw support their efforts to cabin the flexibility available to Congress.  The \n8  geographic boundary and necessity requirement together amply suffice.  See, e.g., \n9  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475-76 (holding that “necessity” standard “fits comfortably \n10  within the scope of discretion permitted by our precedent”); Touby v. United States, \n11  500 U.S. 160, 163 (1991) (approving delegation to the Attorney General of the \n12  authority to designate a drug as a controlled substance for purposes of criminal drug \n13  enforcement if doing so was “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public \n14  safety”).44  What Congress has crafted is not “virtually unfettered” discretion, Coal. \n15  Br. at 23, but targeted flexibility.  While Congress initially anticipated that NEPA and \n16  the ESA could be the source of undue construction delay and thus made them \n17  expressly waivable, see Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title I § 102(c), in 2005, \n18  Congress shifted to the current waiver approach after several of the current plaintiffs \n19  unexpectedly used the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”) to shut down \n20  construction.  See Ex. 2, H.R. Rep. 109-72 at 171 (May 3, 2005) (Conf. Rep.) \n21  (“Continued delays caused by litigation have demonstrated the need for additional \n22  waiver authority with respect to other laws . . . such as the Coastal Zone Management \n23  Act.”).  Section 102 reflects Congress’ discovery that it could not sufficiently \n24  anticipate the ways that existing laws would be wielded to frustrate Congress’ \n25  priorities.  And here, where the lawsuit centers on the same three laws that had \n26                                             \n44 Plaintiffs seek to distinguish these cases based on their facts, but the cases \n27 \ndemonstrate the Supreme Court’s recognition of how limited the intelligible principle \n28  inquiry must be to ensure that Congress retains sufficient flexibility. \n  55 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1163   Page 74 of 99\n \n1  Congress’ attention—NEPA and the ESA (from the beginning), and the CZMA (since \n2  2005)—Plaintiffs cannot credibly claim that unaccountable discretion is the problem \n3  here. \n4  Plaintiffs also attack prior courts’ reliance on the fact that border infrastructure \n5  implicates the Executive Branch’s significant independent control over immigration, \n6  foreign affairs, and national security.  See, e.g., Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n7  44244, at *22-23; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 126, 129.  It is well-\n8  established in this Circuit that Congress may delegate in even broader terms in such \n9  areas.  See Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 897 (holding that when the delegation \n10  “arises within the realm of national security . . . the intelligible principle standard need \n11  not be overly rigid”); see also Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 772 (1996) \n12  (finding that delegations may be broader “where the entity exercising the delegated \n13  authority itself possesses independent authority over the subject matter”); Knauff v. \n14  Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542-43 (1950) (“The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental \n15  act of sovereignty . . . [and] is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign \n16  affairs of the nation.”).  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, see Coal. Br. at 25, nothing \n17  in Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076 (2015) undermines this binding precedent.  In \n18  Zivotofsky, the Supreme Court simply expressed caution about a prior “description of \n19  the President’s exclusive power,” in part because it was dicta in a case that “dealt with \n20  congressionally authorized action.”  Id. at 2090.  Because the Executive Branch’s \n21  actions here are likewise “congressionally authorized” Plaintiffs cannot evade this \n22  settled conclusion.45  \n23  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that judicial review is essential for a delegation to be \n24  upheld.  See Ctr. Br. at 37; Cal. Br. at 34.  Plaintiffs cannot prevail because the Ninth \n25  Circuit expressly rejected the argument that statutory limitations on judicial review \n26                                             \n45 Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Mattis, 868 F.3d 803, 827 (9th Cir. 2017), cited by \n27 \nPlaintiffs, does not suggest that Zivotofsky undermined other Ninth Circuit decisions, \n28  but simply applied it to a “political question” inquiry that has no relevance here. \n  56 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1164   Page 75 of 99\n \n1  create a nondelegation problem.  See Bozarov, 974 F.2d at 1041-45.  The Ninth \n2  Circuit agreed with the government that “the purpose of the intelligible principle is \n3  simply to channel the discretion of the executive and to permit Congress to determine \n4  whether its will is being obeyed.”  Id. at 1041 (“[T]he government has the better of the \n5  argument.”).  In that case, the Ninth Circuit rejected arguments parallel to those of \n6  Plaintiffs here and concluded, “[i]n sum, we believe that the Supreme Court cases \n7  upholding judicial preclusion of agency decisions, the language of the APA, and the \n8  fact that the EAA involves foreign policy issues support our conclusion that the \n9  EAA’s preclusion of judicial review is constitutional.”  Id. at 1044.  Because that \n10  same reasoning applies here, the limitation of judicial review to constitutional claims \n11  should not create a nondelegation problem.46   \n12  In sum, the Act contains a sufficiently intelligible principle to survive \n13  constitutional scrutiny and Plaintiff’s claims to the contrary should be dismissed.  \n14  B.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Article I § 3 \n15  California asserts that “Congress cannot provide the President or the Executive \n16  Branch with such sweeping powers to waive federal criminal laws in its sole \n17  discretion, without even listing which criminal laws can be waived.”  Cal. Br. at 36.  \n18  But Plaintiffs identify no constitutional provision or case supporting such a \n19  conclusion.  Neither the fact that impeached federal officers can be criminally \n20  prosecuted, Art. I § 3, nor the fact that the President cannot pardon impeached federal \n21  officers, Art. I § 2, suggest that Congress cannot delegate power to waive criminal \n22  laws.  Similarly, caselaw about the limits of official immunity for prosecutors and \n23 \n                                           \n24  46 In Bozarov, the Ninth Circuit also “noted in closing” that its conclusion was \n“bolstered” by the availability of judicial review for constitutional claims and ultra \n25 \nvires claims.  Id. at 1044-45.  While the availability of such review under that statute \n26  made the case easier, nothing in the Ninth Circuit reasoning suggests that the removal \nof ultra vires review would alter the outcome.  Indeed, it relied in part on the fact that \n27 \n“the language of the APA itself [in 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1)] . . . suggests that Congress \n28  intended that certain agency actions be immune from judicial review.”  Id. at 1042. \n  57 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1165   Page 76 of 99\n \n1  judges, see, e.g., Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980), and about circumstances \n2  where “the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential \n3  privilege,” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 707 (1974), says nothing about what \n4  Congress can delegate to the Executive Branch. \n5  While California raises the specter of “the Executive Branch . . . put[ting] itself \n6  above the law,” id. at 37, it can point to nothing more than the fact that two of the \n7  environmental statutes waived by the Secretary contain criminal sanctions for extreme \n8  misconduct.  See Cal. Br. at 36 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 6928 and 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c)).  \n9  This is far from “simply ignor[ing] or unilaterally waiv[ing] a criminal law.”  Cal. Br. \n10  at 36.  Indeed, in a system where the Executive Branch has such “broad discretion” \n11  about whom to prosecute, see United States v. JDT, 762 F.3d 984, 996 (9th Cir. 2014), \n12  it would be odd to conclude that Congress had less power to delegate authority to \n13  relieve criminal sanctions than in other areas.47  Cf. Loving, 517 U.S. at 767-68 \n14  (rejecting argument that Congress should have no power to delegate its authority to \n15  regulate military affairs, including prescribing aggravating factors in capital cases, in \n16  part because it could “discern no reasons why Congress should have less capacity to \n17  make measured and appropriate delegations of this power than of any other”).  The \n18  constitutional constraint Plaintiffs proposed simply does not exist. \n19  C.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Article I § 7 \n20  Plaintiffs also claim that Congress’ delegation of authority to waive federal \n21  statutes infringes on the lawmaking procedures required under Article I, § 7 of the \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n47 Plaintiffs gain no support from Touby v. United States, which noted that the \n24  Supreme Court had not resolved whether the nondelegation doctrine should require \n“more specific guidance” where “Congress authorizes another Branch to promulgate \n25 \nregulations that contemplate criminal sanctions.”  500 U.S. at 165-66.  Such concern \n26  about limits on agency authority to impose criminal sanctions on individuals is quite \ndistinct from delegated authority to lift criminal sanctions.  And Touby makes clear \n27 \nthat the Supreme Court has not, in fact, imposed an additional requirement, even for \n28  the more troubling circumstance. \n  58 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1166   Page 77 of 99\n \n1  Constitution.  See Ctr. Br. at 32-34; Coal. Br. at 27; Cal. Br. at 37-40.  Clauses 2 and 3 \n2  of Article I, § 7 are called the “presentment clauses.”  See United States v. Scampini, \n3  911 F.2d 350, 351 (9th Cir. 1990).  These clauses “require that all legislation be \n4  presented to the President so that he may have the opportunity to exercise his veto \n5  power before any legislation becomes law.”  Id.  Plaintiffs does not argue that IIRIRA \n6  did not conform to the Presentment Clauses when it was enacted.  Instead they argue \n7  that permitting existing statutes to be waived for certain purposes constitutes \n8  “amendment and repeal of statutes.”  See, e.g., Ctr. Br. at 32 (quoting INS v. Chada, \n9  462 U.S. 919, 954 (1983)).  Plaintiffs’ claim is meritless, and both courts to consider \n10  such a challenge to § 102(c) have rejected it.  See County of El Paso, 2008 WL \n11  4372693, at *6-7; Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 123-26. \n12  The Presentment Clauses require a specific process, prohibiting legislative \n13  action that does not conform to it.  Thus, the Constitution does not authorize the \n14  President “to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 \n15  U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  In Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto \n16  Act, which gave the President the authority to “cancel” certain appropriated spending \n17  items that had been passed by Congress.  524 U.S. at 438.  That statute failed because \n18  cancellation prevented the items “from having legal force or effect” and thus in “both \n19  legal and practical effect, the President has amended two Acts of Congress by \n20  repealing a portion of each.”  Id.; see also id. at 447 (holding it improper to give the \n21  President “unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes”).  \n22  Plaintiffs’ claim fails because waiver of a legal requirement for a specific \n23  purpose is not amendment or repeal of a statute.  As Defenders of Wildlife explained: \n24  [t]he Secretary has no authority to alter the text of any statute, repeal any \nlaw, or cancel any statutory provision, in whole or in part. Each of the [] \n25 \nlaws waived by the Secretary . . . retains the same legal force and effect \n26  as it had when it was passed by both houses of Congress and presented to \nthe President. \n27 \n527 F. Supp. 2d at 124.

The statutes retain their general legal force and effect because the \n3  Secretary’s waiver extends to only a tiny fraction of the universe of cases to which \n4  NEPA and similar statutes apply.  While Plaintiffs hyperbolically assert that, in the \n5  aggregate, the § 102(c) waivers have “cut a large hole in the fabric of protections \n6  provided by NEPA” and other environmental laws, Ctr. Br. at 34, and “effectively \n7  repeal[ed] dozens of laws,” Cal. Br. at 40, the fact remains that these laws remain in \n8  force in almost all of their applications, and no single provision of these laws is left \n9  without any application.48  Plaintiffs have identified no basis to conclude that such \n10  waivers violate the Constitution.  See Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F.3d 41, 64 n.3 \n11  (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring) (dismissing constitutional challenge to \n12  statute permitting President to make inapplicable to Iraq “any other provision of law \n13  that applies to countries that have supported terrorism” because the authorized actions \n14  “are a far cry from the line-item veto at issue in Clinton, and are instead akin to the \n15  waivers that the President is routinely empowered to make in other areas, particularly \n16  in the realm of foreign policy”). \n17 \n                                           \n18  48 The Center attempts to counter this fact by pointing to a single law “with limited \ngeographic reach,” the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-145.  \n19 \nSee Ctr. Br. at 34 n.23.  That law designated certain public lands as wilderness and \n20  incorporated it into the National Wilderness Preservation System.  See Pub. L. No. \n106-145, § 3.  But the waiver does not impair the wilderness designation, and all \n21 \nactivities outside the scope of the waiver remain subject to the limitations and \n22  restrictions of that Act.  Moreover, the San Diego project area does not include any \nportion of this designated area.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 35985 (identifying area extending \n23 \nonly 15 miles from Pacific Ocean); Memorandum, Construction and Evaluation of \n24  Border Wall Prototypes, U.S. Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, California at 2 & Fig. \n1 (Sept. 25, 2017) (explaining that the prototypes construction occurred to the west of \n25 \nthe “western base of Otay Mountain”); BLM, Otay Mountain Wilderness,  \n26  https://www.blm.gov/visit/otay-mountain-wilderness (showing that the designated \nwilderness does not extend as far west as the San Diego project area).  Accordingly, \n27 \nPlaintiffs cannot show that the Secretary’s protective waiver of this statute impaired \n28  the “legal force or effect” of the law. \n  60 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1168   Page 79 of 99\n \n1  Indeed, this waiver authority is similar to an “executive grant of immunity or \n2  waiver of claim” which “has never been recognized as a form of legislative repeal.”  \n3  See Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 895.  The Ninth Circuit rejected a Presentment \n4  Clause challenge to 50 U.S.C. § 1885a, which permits the Attorney General “to \n5  immunize from suit telecommunications companies that had cooperated with the \n6  government’s intelligence gathering.”  Id. at 891.  Even though such grants of \n7  immunity prevent civil actions to enforce the otherwise applicable “law governing \n8  electronic surveillance,” the Circuit found no constitutional defect because “[t]he law \n9  remains as it was when Congress approved it and the President signed it.”  Id. at 894-\n10  95.  The Circuit also supported its conclusion by noting that the authority for \n11  executive officials to “trigger a defense or immunity for a third party,” is “not \n12  uncommon.”  Id. at 895.  Here, similarly, the § 102(c) authority in one statute granting \n13  authority to waive application of one or more other statutes is not uncommon.  See \n14  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 125 & n.5 (collecting some of the “myriad \n15  examples of waiver provisions in federal statutes”); see also, e.g., 25 U.S.C. § 3406 \n16  (authorizing “Secretary of each Federal agency providing funds” for program to waive \n17  “any statutory requirement, regulation, policy, or procedure promulgated by that \n18  agency”); Pub. L. No. 109-171, § 5107(a)(2), 120 Stat. 42 (Feb. 6, 2006) (providing \n19  for waiver of “such provisions of law . . . as are necessary to implement [specified \n20  statutory provision] on a timely basis”).49   \n21  Nor does § 102(c) raise the same separation of powers concerns that were at \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n49 Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the waiver authority here from other waiver statutes \n24  by the scope of the waiver or the availability of judicial review, see Ctr. Br. at 33-34; \nCal. Br. at 39; but they do not purport to canvas all other waiver statutes enacted by \n25 \nCongress and cannot show that any court found such distinctions relevant.  Under the \n26  logic of Clinton and other precedent, so long as a waiver does not leave a statutory \nprovision with no legal effect, there is no plausible claim for a legislative repeal in \n27 \nviolation of the Presentment Clauses.  See Acree, 370 F.3d at 64 n.3; Telecomm. \n28  Records, 671 F.3d at 895. \n  61 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1169   Page 80 of 99\n \n1  issue in Clinton.  There, the Supreme Court was concerned that the President’s line-\n2  item veto was “rejecting the policy judgment made by Congress and relying on his \n3  own policy judgment.”  524 U.S. at 444.  But here, Congress unmistakably expressed \n4  its policy judgment that construction of the barriers and roads along the border was of \n5  such importance that it justified waiving application of environmental and other laws \n6  to the extent those laws threaten expeditious construction.  See IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  \n7  Thus, in sharp contrast to Clinton, there is no question that the Secretary is executing \n8  (rather than rejecting) the will of Congress.  Cf. Smith v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., \n9  280 F. Supp. 2d 314, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (upholding waiver where “[u]nlike in \n10  Clinton” the President “is carrying out, not rejecting, a policy made by Congress”).  \n11  Plaintiffs argue that, nevertheless, the Secretary acts “contrary to the intent of \n12  Congress by waiving laws passed by Congress,” Cal. Br. at 39, but this unsupported \n13  assertion would defeat every waiver, no matter how limited.  In addition, application \n14  of waiver authority for the limited displacement of laws passed before § 102, as \n15  generally occurred here, does not raise the concern present in Clinton that Congress’ \n16  current intention is being discarded.  See 524 U.S. at 444 n.35 (“Because the Line \n17  Item Veto Act requires the President to act within five days, every exercise of the \n18  cancellation power will necessarily be based on the same facts and circumstances that \n19  Congress considered, and therefore constitute a rejection of the policy choice made by \n20  Congress.”).  Here, there is nothing unseemly in the Secretary’s implementation of the \n21  intent Congress expressed in 2005 for the narrow waiver of NEPA, the ESA, and the \n22  CZMA, passed decades earlier, and the only laws upon which Plaintiffs base their \n23  claims.  Cf. Moyle v. Dir., Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 147 F.3d \n24  1116, 1120 (9th Cir. 1998) (“[W]here provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable \n25  conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the \n26  earlier one.”); Maldonado, 67 F.

The Secretary’s Action Does Not Violate Article II § 3 \n2  The Center alone argues that exercise of the waiver authority Congress \n3  provided in law constitutes failure to “faithfully execute” the waived laws.  Ctr. Br. at \n4  30-32.  The Center asks the Court to transform the Constitution’s provision that the \n5  President “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” Art. II, § 3, into a \n6  freestanding opportunity for plaintiffs to challenge any agency action they believe to \n7  be ultra vires.  See Ctr. Br. at 32 (“[T]he Take Care Clause’s mandate . . . precludes \n8  actions beyond the scope of the law at issue.”).  As set out in Defendants’ opening \n9  brief regarding the Center’s claims, this claim fails for numerous reasons.  See Defs.’ \n10  Mot. to Dismiss at 30-33 (“Defs.’ MTD”), ECF No. 18-1.   \n11  First, the Supreme Court has rejected the Center’s proposal that every claim that \n12  Executive Branch officials have violated a statutory command should give rise to a \n13  constitutional claim.  “The distinction between claims that an official exceeded his \n14  statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the \n15  Constitution, on the other, is . . . well established.”  Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, \n16  474 (1994); see also id. at 473 (“[C]laims simply alleging that the President has \n17  exceeded his statutory authority are not ‘constitutional’ claims[] subject to judicial \n18  review.”).  While Dalton was not directly addressing a Take Care Clause theory, its \n19  reasoning is dispositive.  Dalton rejected an attempt to apply Youngstown Sheet & \n20  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) to mean that “whenever the President acts in \n21  excess of his statutory authority, he also violates the constitutional separation-of-\n22  powers doctrine.”  511 U.S. at 472.  The Center, here, likewise seeks to extract the \n23  same discredited notion from Youngstown’s reference to the Take Care Clause.  See \n24  Ctr. Br. at 32 (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 587).50  Yet the Center takes no \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n50 Moreover, Youngstown and Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 (2008), cannot support \nthe Center’s approach because those cases concerned attempts to use the Take Care \n27 \nClause as an independent basis for Executive Branch action where no statute applied.  \n28 \nSee 343 U.S. at 587; 552 U.S. at 532.  In rejecting such attempts to use the Clause as a \n  63 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1171   Page 82 of 99\n \n1  account of Dalton in its brief.  It would be a sweeping and unwarranted novelty for \n2  litigants to be permitted to transform a garden-variety ultra vires claim into a \n3  constitutional one any time they allege that an agency’s specific use of a statutory \n4  authority constitutes failure to comply with a statute.51 \n5  Second, Defendants have shown that, to the extent any affirmative suit under \n6  this Clause is appropriate,52 it must be brought against the President.  See Defs.’ MTD \n7  at 31; Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 493 (2010) \n8  (“It is his responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck \n9  stops with the President, in Harry Truman’s famous phrase.”).  Courts have \n10  recognized that the Clause carves out space for the President to manage subordinates \n11  in the Executive Branch without judicial interference.  See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 \n12  U.S. at 495-96; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689-90 (1988); Clinton v. Jones, \n13  520 U.S. 681, 712-13 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring).  Thus, any suit under this \n14                                             \nsource of Executive Branch authority apart from any statute, the Supreme Court did \n15 \nnot—as the Center would have it—treat the Clause as the basis for an ultra vires \n16  challenge.  Indeed, as Defendants’ previously noted, no court has ever treated the \nTake Care Clause as basis for affirmative relief.  See Defs.’ MTD at 32. \n17 \n51 The Center fashions this argument to evade Congressional limits on judicial review \n18 \nin the APA and other statutes.  See Ctr. Br. at 30 (quoting Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n19  505 U.S. 788, 801 (1992), which permitted review of the “President’s actions . . . for \nconstitutionality” where APA review was precluded).  Acceptance of this theory \n20 \nwould have sweeping implications. \n21 \n52 Defendants also dispute that the Clause provides a private cause of action.  It has \n22  never previously been used as a source of affirmative relief.  See Defs.’ MTD at 32.  \nThe Center simply counters that there is a “long recognized . . . claim for relief against \n23 \nfederal officials’ unconstitutional acts.”  Ctr. Br. at 31.  But the Supreme Court made \n24  clear in Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015), such relief \n“is a judge-made remedy” that is “subject to express and implied statutory \n25 \nlimitations.”  Id. at 1384-85.  The Take Care Clause is distinct from the Appointments \n26  Clause and separation-of-powers claims at issue in Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at \n491 n.2, because for all the reasons discussed in this section it cannot be subject to \n27 \njudicial supervision without intruding on the very power given to the President’s \n28  exclusive control. \n  64 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1172   Page 83 of 99\n \n1  Clause brought seeking relief from an agency rather than the President asks the Court \n2  to exercise authority over Executive Branch subordinates that the Clause commits to \n3  the President himself rather than to courts.  See Defs.’ MTD at 31-32; Mississippi v. \n4  Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, 499 (1867) (holding that “the duty of the President in the \n5  exercise of the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed” is not judicially \n6  enforceable, adding that any attempt by the judiciary to oversee the President’s Take \n7  Care authority “might be justly characterized . . . as ‘an absurd and excessive \n8  extravagance.’”); Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., \n9  concurring in part) (stating that Court cannot order relief that would interfere with \n10  President’s constitutional responsibility under the Take Care Clause). \n11  Finally, Defendants have shown that—to the extent the Center’s theory is \n12  grounded on a mere failure to enforce the waived statutes rather than its ultra vires \n13  claims—its claim is incoherent.  See Defs.’ MTD at 33.  Because the waiver \n14  determination was made pursuant to Congress’ own instruction that laws be waived \n15  under certain conditions, the waiver itself should be considered faithful execution of \n16  an act of Congress, not a breach of any duty to enforce the laws.  The Center offers no \n17  response to this point, appearing to rely exclusively on the ultra vires notion which \n18  cannot be reconciled with Dalton.     \n19  E.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate Constitutional Provisions \nRegarding Access to the Courts \n20 \nPlaintiffs argue that § 102(c)’s limitations on judicial review violate \n21 \nconstitutional protections regarding access to the courts.  See Coal. Br. at 27-30; Cal. \n22 \nBr. at 28-30.  They purport to root this argument in the general principles of Article \n23 \nIII, in the First Amendment right to “petition for the redress of grievances,” and in the \n24 \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  See id.  None of these claims is \n25 \nmeritorious. \n26 \nFirst, Plaintiffs assert that § 102(c)’s limits on district court jurisdiction \n27 \ninterfere with the “right of access to the courts” based in the First Amendment right to \n28 \n  65 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1173   Page 84 of 99\n \n1  “petition for redress of grievances” (the “Petition Clause”).  Cal. Br. at 30; Coal. Br. at \n2  29.53  Courts have applied the Petition Clause both to government actions that would \n3  penalize efforts to file lawsuits, see, e.g., Munguia v. Frias, No. 07-1016, 2009 WL \n4  3157482, at *12 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2009), and to actions that would prohibit abusive \n5  litigants from filing additional lawsuits.  See, e.g., BE & K Const. Co. v. NLRB, 536 \n6  U.S. 516, 524-25 (2002); Ringgold-Lockhart v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 761 F.3d 1057, \n7  1061-62 (9th Cir. 2014).  But this case presents neither situation.  And Plaintiffs cite \n8  no caselaw suggesting that the Petition Clause cabins Congress’ authority under \n9  Article III to define lower court jurisdiction. 54  See supra Arg. § II(A); Duldulao, 90 \n10  F.3d at 400 (holding that Article III gives Congress “the constitutional authority to \n11  define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts”); see also Exxon Mobil, 545 U.S. at \n12  552 (“[D]istrict courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis.”).  \n13  Indeed, the available caselaw holds precisely the opposite:   \n14  [T]he right of access to federal courts is not a free-floating right, but \nrather is subject to Congress’ Article III power to set limits on federal \n15 \njurisdiction. . . . Congress is no more compelled to guarantee free access \n16  to federal courts than it is to provide unlimited access to them. \n17                                             \n53 The “right of access to the courts” encompasses a variety of constitutional concerns.  \n18 \nSee, e.g., Ringgold-Lockhart v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 761 F.3d 1057, 1061-62 (citing \n19  caselaw noting that the Supreme Court has located the court access right “in the \nPrivileges and Immunities clause, the First Amendment petition clause, the Fifth \n20 \nAmendment due process clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection \n21  clause”).  Plaintiffs appear to base their claims only in the First Amendment petition \nclause. \n22 \n54 Plaintiffs’ reliance on In re Workers’ Compensation Refund, 46 F.3d 813 (8th Cir. \n23 \n1995) is misplaced.  See Cal. Br. at 30.  That case involved a state law providing that a \n24  nonprofit association funded by insurance companies must reimburse the state for all \nlitigation costs related to challenges to the validity or enforcement of a new statute.  \n25 \n46 F.3d at 816, 821.  The Eighth Circuit concluded that “[r]equiring one party to pay \n26  the full cost of an action, regardless of who prevails, is a substantial deterrent to \ncommencing litigation,” which the state had not justified.  Id. at 822.  That decision, \n27 \nin line with the penalization cases cited above, does not bear on Congress’ authority to \n28  limit the jurisdiction of federal courts. \n  66 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1174   Page 85 of 99\n \n1  Roller v.

Locke, 423 F.3d \n2  1101, 1116 (9th Cir. 2005) (right of access “is not absolute” and “must be exercised \n3  within the limits of the courts’ prescribed procedures”); Nunag-Tanedo v.

Here, where \n7  Congress has expressly provided for review of constitutional challenges to the \n8  exercise of § 102(c) waiver authority,56 there is no reason to stretch cases applying the \n9  Petition Clause from its role in protecting access to available judicial remedies to an \n10  entirely novel role limiting Congress’ jurisdiction-stripping authority for non-\n11  constitutional claims.57 \n12                                             \n55 See also Abdul-Akbar v.

Andress-Tobiasson, No. 2:12-1571, 2013 WL 560508, at *2 (D. Nev. Feb. 11, \n2013) (same). \n15 \n56 Because Congress has not limited constitutional arguments, § 102(c) is entirely \n16 \ndissimilar from the statutory provision rejected under the Free Speech Clause in Legal \n17  Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001).  Coal. Br. at 29.  There, the \nSupreme Court rejected a statutory provision preventing any attorney received Legal \n18 \nServices Corporation funding “from arguing to a court that a state statute conflicts \n19  with a federal statute or that either a state or federal statute by its terms or in its \napplication is violative of the United States Constitution.”  531 U.S. at 537.  Not only \n20 \nwas that decision animated by concerns regarding government attempts to bar \n21  discussion of constitutional claims, its analysis is inextricably tied to the concerns \nraised by a government speech restriction tied to government funding.  See id. at 546.  \n22 \nThe Supreme Court did not address whether limits on nonconstitutional claims would \n23  raise similar problems.  See id. (referring to “questions of statutory validity” to \nincorporate the statute’s prohibition on arguing that a state law is preempted under the \n24 \nSupremacy Clause). \n25 \n57 While the Coalition Plaintiffs baldly assert that “the ultra vires cases rest on a \n26  recognition of the fundamental constitutional problem that would otherwise arise,” \nCoal. Br. at 28, they do not support this proposition and Defendants have shown, to \n27 \nthe contrary, that ultra vires review rests on a presumption of congressional intent \n28  rather than on constitutional necessity.  See supra Arg. § III(A)(3). \n  67 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1175   Page 86 of 99\n \n1  Second, Plaintiffs argue that, even if Congress has general authority to limit the \n2  jurisdiction of lower federal courts, it cannot simultaneously eliminate the concurrent \n3  jurisdiction of state courts.  See Coal. Br. at 28.  It is undisputed here that, by making \n4  “exclusive” federal district court jurisdiction over claims related to waiver \n5  determinations, § 102(c)(2)(A), Congress has displaced whatever state court \n6  jurisdiction would otherwise be available.  See, e.g., Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, \n7  459 (1990) (holding that “presumption in favor of concurrent state court jurisdiction \n8  is, of course, rebutted if Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction \n9  over a particular federal claim”).  Plaintiffs cite no authority establishing that the \n10  Constitution imposes such a limitation on Congress’ power to shape the jurisdiction of \n11  lower courts and preempt state court action.  Plaintiffs rely primarily on Justice \n12  Thomas’s dissent in Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729 (2009), which discussed the \n13  origins of concurrent jurisdiction.  But Plaintiffs get no support from his argument that \n14  the Constitution does not require state courts to accept jurisdiction over federal claims.  \n15  Id. at 745-46.  Indeed, a prior Supreme Court case, approvingly quoted by Justice \n16  Thomas, is fatal to Plaintiffs’ theory: \n17  [I]n judicial matters the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals \ndepends altogether upon the pleasure of Congress, and may be revoked \n18 \nand extinguished whenever they think proper, in every case in which the \n19  subject-matter can constitutionally be made cognizable in the Federal \ncourts[.]   \n20 \nHaywood, 556 U.S. at 747 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Plaquemines Tropical \n21 \nFruit Co. v.

Ratta, 292 U.S. 263 (1934), cited by Plaintiffs without explanation, \n24  likewise does not support their theory.  In Healy, the Supreme Court “strict[ly] \nconstru[ed]” the diversity jurisdiction statute to effectuate congressional intent and to \n25 \nensure that federal courts, out of “due regard for the rightful independence of state \n26  governments,” “scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which \nthe statute has defined.”  292 U.S. at 270.  Nothing in Healy suggests that Congress, \n27 \nwhen acting “in conformity to [Article III],” id. cannot adopt any specific restriction \n28  on state court jurisdiction.    \n  68 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1176   Page 87 of 99\n \n1  Plaintiffs cite any authority suggesting the Constitution requires a forum for every \n2  claim to be heard. \n3  Finally, Plaintiffs claim that § 102(c)’s limitation on judicial review, either \n4  independently, Coal. Br. at 29, or as implemented by the challenged waiver \n5  determinations, Cal. Br. at 27-29, fails to provide adequate notice in violation of the \n6  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  This claim fails at the threshold.  It is \n7  Plaintiffs’ burden to establish a life, liberty, or property interest for which due process \n8  is required.  See Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005) (“[T]hose who seek to \n9  invoke [Due Process Clause] protection must establish that one of these interests is at \n10  stake.”).  Here, Plaintiffs make no attempt to carry that burden.  See Coal. Br. at 29 \n11  (asserting without explanation “the Coalition Plaintiffs’ property and liberty interests \n12  in ensuring environmental laws and interests are protected”); Cal. Br. at 27-30 (never \n13  identifying what cognizable interests are at stake).59  And there is no reason to believe \n14  that they have in fact been deprived of any cognizable interest.60 \n15  But even if they had identified a protected interest, Plaintiffs cannot show that \n16  the statute or the waiver determinations fail to provide sufficient notice.  California \n17  claims that the waiver determinations leave it “having to guess which state laws have \n18  been waived.”  Cal. Br. at 29.  But they provide nothing to suggest that there is any \n19 \n                                           \n20 \n59 Wilkinson does not support Plaintiffs’ assertion of a liberty interest.  In that case the \n21  Supreme Court referenced a “liberty interest in avoiding withdrawal of state-created \nsystem of good-time credits,” 545 U.S. at 221, but Wilkinson and the cases it cites \n22 \nconcern the liberty interests of prisoners.  Plaintiffs’ liberty is not similarly affected by \n23  the enforcement or waiver of environmental laws. \n24  60 California’s challenge to § 102(c)’s 60-day statute of limitations is an irrelevant \nhypothetical.  It is undisputed that these suits are timely.  And California merely cites \n25 \ntwo cases about retroactive application of new statutes of limitations to existing \n26  claims.  See Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 21 F.3d 696, 701-04 (5th Cir. 1994); \nWilson v. Iseminger, 185 U.S. 55, 62-63 (1902).  Neither case suggests that a statute \n27 \nof limitations with merely prospective application could be held unconstitutional on \n28  due process grounds.  \n  69 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1177   Page 88 of 99\n \n1  actual ambiguity in a determination that specifies which federal laws are waived and \n2  includes all “state, or other laws regulations and legal requirements of, deriving from, \n3  or related to the subject of” those federal laws.  82 Fed. Reg. at 35985, 42830.  Indeed, \n4  because state law that can bind federal action is vanishingly rare, California would be \n5  hard pressed to identify any laws that might or might not be affected.  The one state \n6  law that clearly falls within this scope has been included in this litigation.  See Cal. \n7  Compl. ¶¶ 38-39, 112-15 (Sept. 20, 2017) (alleging violation of the California Coastal \n8  Act and California Coastal Management Program, state statutes which were provided \n9  for and approved pursuant to the CZMA).  Separately, California argues that the San \n10  Diego waiver determination is “hopelessly vague” because it provides: \n11  DHS will immediately implement various border infrastructure projects. . \n. . All of the projects that DHS will undertake within the Project Area \n12 \nwill further Border Patrol’s ability to deter and prevent illegal crossings. \n13  For example, DHS will replace existing primary fencing in the Project \nArea. . . . DHS will also build prototype border wall in the Project Area \n14 \nnear the eastern terminus of the existing secondary barrier. \n15 \n82 Fed. Reg. 35984-85.  This due process challenge fails at the threshold for the \n16 \nreasons discussed above—no cognizable interest is at stake.  See Hunt v. City of Los \n17 \nAngeles, 638 F.3d 703, 710 (9th Cir. 2011) (“In making a vagueness challenge, a \n18 \nplaintiff actually raises a due process . . . claim.”).  The claim also fails on the merits \n19 \nbecause DHS does not construe this waiver determination to encompass any border \n20 \ninfrastructure projects other than the projects specifically identified in the \n21 \ndetermination.  \n22 \nF.  The Waiver Provision Does Not Violate the Tenth Amendment \n23 \nThe Tenth Amendment “reserve[s] to the States respectively, or to the people” \n24 \nthe powers the Constitution has not “delegated to the United States” or “prohibited . . . \n25 \nto the States.”  U.S. Const., 10th Amend.  In general, “if Congress acts under one of \n26 \nits enumerated powers, there can be no violation of the Tenth Amendment.”  United \n27 \nStates v. Jones, 231 F.3d 508, 515 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Gila River Indian \n28 \n  70 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1178   Page 89 of 99\n \n1  Community v. United States, 729 F.3d 1139, 1153 (9th Cir. 2013) (“If a power is \n2  delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims \n3  any reservation of that power to the States.” (quoting New York v. United States, 505 \n4  U.S. 144, 156-57 (1992))).  This includes the power to preempt state laws that conflict \n5  with or serve as an obstacle to the purposes of federal law.  See, e.g., S. Cal. Edison \n6  Co. v. Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 808 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The application of federal pre-\n7  emption . . . would not intrude on the rights reserved under the Tenth Amendment.”); \n8  United States v. Geiger, 263 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 2001) (“If Congress has the \n9  constitutional authority to enact legislation, then the pre-emption question is whether \n10  Congress intended to displace state law in that area, not whether the existence of state \n11  law forbade Congress from regulating.”).  And waiver of state law—whether by \n12  statute or by regulation—is simply a limited form of federal preemption.  Cf. Nat’l \n13  Fed’n of the Blind v. United Airlines, Inc., 813 F.3d 718, 734 (9th Cir. 2013) (noting \n14  that “where Congress has entrusted an agency with the task of promulgating \n15  regulations to carry out the purposes of a statute, . . . [courts] must consider whether \n16  the regulations evidence a desire to occupy a field completely”); Engine Mfrs. Ass’n v. \n17  S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 498 F.3d 1031, 1043 (9th Cir. 2007) (discussing \n18  Clean Air Act provision permitting express preemption of state law to be waived in \n19  certain circumstances). \n20  Here, Congress legislated to regulate the international border of the United \n21  States and to reduce illegal entry into the United States of persons and contraband—\n22  violations of federal law.  These are quintessentially within Congress’ inherent and \n23  enumerated powers.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 (2012) \n24  (“The federal power to determine immigration policy is well settled.”); id. at 422 \n25  (2012) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that immigration \n26  legislation “is an inherent attribute of sovereignty” which was why “there was no need \n27  to set forth control of immigration as one of the enumerated powers of Congress”); \n28 \n  71 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1179   Page 90 of 99\n \n1  United States v. Hernandez-Guerrero, 963 F. Supp. 933, 937 (S.D. Cal. 1997), aff’d \n2  147 F.3d 1075 (9th Cir. 1998) (concluding that “criminal immigration sanctions” are a \n3  constitutional “exercise of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause”).  \n4  Indeed, California does not suggest that Congress lacked authority to enact § 102 \n5  generally, i.e., to direct DHS to construct barriers and roads in the vicinity of the \n6  international border.  California only challenges Section 102(c)’s waiver provision for \n7  its “federal interference in state policy powers and state sovereignty.”  Cal. Br. at 26.  \n8  But this is not enough to raise a viable Tenth Amendment claim.  “Generally \n9  speaking, . . . a power granted to Congress trumps a competing claim based on a \n10  state’s police power.”  Gonzalez v. Raich, 500 F.3d 850, 867 (9th Cir. 2007). \n11  California makes two attempts to avoid the Ninth Circuit’s straightforward \n12  Tenth Amendment jurisprudence.  First, it attempts to appropriate Shelby Cnty., Ala. v. \n13  Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2622 (2013), which concluded that the “extraordinary \n14  measures” taken in 1965 “to address [the] extraordinary problem” of “entrenched race \n15  discrimination in voting” were no longer justified “[n]early 50 years later.”  133 S. Ct. \n16  at 2618.  In Shelby County, the Supreme Court was primarily concerned that “equal \n17  sovereignty” among the states was impaired by expressly singling out certain states, \n18  and that those states “must beseech the Federal Government for permission to \n19  implement [election] laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and \n20  execute on their own.”  Id. at 2623-24.  By contrast, there is no impairment of “equal \n21  sovereignty” for Congress to pass laws regarding the international border of the \n22  United States, and thus impacting the states in which that border lies.  And there is no \n23  comparison between the limited waiver of state laws that might impair expeditious \n24  construction of border infrastructure and a comprehensive preclearance requirement \n25  for “all changes to state election law—however innocuous.”  Id. at 2624.61  Moreover, \n26 \n                                           \n61 There is simply no basis for California’s hyperbolic claim that § 102(c) “interferes \n27 \nfar more with state sovereignty than any statute before it.”  Cal. Br. at 27.  For this \n28 \npoint, California does not reference any laws that have actually been waived during \n  72 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1180   Page 91 of 99\n \n1  Shelby County does not stand for a general proposition that constitutionally enacted \n2  statutes become vulnerable whenever there are “changed circumstances.”  Cal. Br. at \n3  26.  In Shelby County, the concerns previously discussed were exacerbated by the fact \n4  that statute continued to single out states “based on decades old data and eradicated \n5  practices.”  133 S. Ct. at 2627.  Here, by contrast, the “steep[] declines in illegal \n6  border crossings,” Cal. Br. at 26, do not undermine either the legitimacy of Congress’s \n7  goal of operation control of the border or DHS’s exercise of the authority Congress \n8  delegated to pursue that goal.  The border situation need not be the crisis that it was in \n9  the 1990s to justify the actions Congress has adopted.  Cf. County of El Paso, No. 08-\n10  196, 2008 WL 4372693, at *8 (“The Secretary, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, has \n11  only waived state and local laws which interfere with Congress’s purpose to construct \n12  the border barrier.”). \n13    Second, California argues that City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) \n14  means that “a federal law is unconstitutional where it so interferes with states’ \n15  traditional police powers as to be ‘out of proportion’ to its object.”  Cal. Br. at 27 \n16  (citing Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533-36).  But the caselaw stands for an entirely different \n17  principle.  A series of cases, including City of Boerne, addressed the limits on \n18  Congress’s power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate a state’s \n19  sovereign immunity to “remedy and deter violation of [constitutional] rights.”  \n20  Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 518 (2004).  In that context, City of Boerne found \n21  that the Religious Freedom Reformation Act did not meet that standard because it was \n22  “so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be \n23  understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior” but \n24 \n                                           \nthe existence of the waiver authority but instead hypothesizes about “indefinitely \n25 \nwaiv[ing] all state and local laws and regulations.”  Cal. Br. at 27.  But there is, in \n26 \nfact, little need to waive state law because few state laws actually limit federal \nconstruction along the international border.  Indeed, as mentioned above, the only \n27 \nstate laws that Plaintiffs have identified as directly impacted here are those related to \n28 \nthe federal CZMA.  See supra Arg. § IV(A).  \n  73 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1181   Page 92 of 99\n \n1  instead attempts “a substantive change in constitutional protections.”  521 U.S. at 532.  \n2  That analysis has no application here, where Congress has not abrogated state \n3  immunity but instead simply preempted certain state laws for one narrow activity.62  \n4  See County of El Paso, No. 08-196, 2008 WL 4372693, at *8 (concluding that a § \n5  102(c) waiver “do[es] not affect the validity of the state and local laws” but “merely \n6  spspend[s] the effects of the state and local laws”). \n7  V.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS UNDER OTHER STATUTES MUST BE \nDISMISSED \n8 \nNone of Plaintiffs’ claims brought under other statutes, with the exception of \n9 \nthe Center’s Freedom of Information Act claim, can survive summary judgment.  \n10 \nFirst, because the waiver determination pursuant to IIRIRA § 102(c)(1) is valid and \n11 \nsurvives any available judicial review as discussed above, see supra, Arg. §§ III, IV, \n12 \nNEPA, the ESA, and the CZMA have been waived as to the challenged projects being \n13 \nconducted by Defendants:  \n14 \n[P]ursuant to section 102(c)(1) of IIRIRA, I hereby waive in their \n15 \nentirety, with respect to the construction of roads and physical barriers . . \n16  . in the Project Area, the following statutes . . . :  The National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (Jan. 1, 1970) \n17 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)); the Endangered Species Act (Pub. L. 93-205, \n18  87 Stat. 884 (Dec. 28, 1973) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)); . . . [and] the \nCoastal Zone Management Act (Pub. L. 92–583 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et \n19 \nseq.))[.] \n20 \n82 Fed. Reg. at 35985; see also id. at 42830.  Accordingly, California’s Counts 1 and \n21 \n2 and the Center’s Counts 5 and 6 have been extinguished and the Court lacks \n22 \njurisdiction to grant any relief pursuant to those statutes.  See Sierra Club, 2005 U.S. \n23 \nDist. LEXIS at *7, 39-40. \n24 \nSecond, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the Center’s ESA claims \n25 \n                                           \n26  62 Plaintiffs’ citation of Gonzalez v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 (2006), is also inapposite \nbecause the Ninth Circuit has instructed that the case concerned “statutory \n27 \nconstruction, not . . . constitutional invalidity under the Tenth Amendment.”  \n28  Gonzalez, 500 F.3d at 867. \n  74 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1182   Page 93 of 99\n \n1  because the Center failed to provide the mandatory notice prerequisite to suit.  Its ESA \n2  claims must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Plaintiff did not provide \n3  “written notice of the violation” to the “Secretary [of Interior], and to any alleged \n4  violator of any such provision or regulation,” prior to filing this suit.  16 U.S.C. \n5  § 1540(g)(2)(A); Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 143 \n6  F.3d 515, 520 (9th Cir. 1998).  Plaintiffs can fulfill this sixty-day notice requirement \n7  only by sending a notice after the alleged violation has occurred:  “[O]ne cannot give \n8  notice of a violation which has not yet happened.”  Kern Cnty. Farm Bureau v. \n9  Badgley, No. 02-5376, 2002 WL 34236869, at *13 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2002); see also \n10  Friends of Animals v. Ashe, 51 F. Supp. 3d 77, 85-87 (D.D.C. 2014), aff’d, 808 F.3d \n11  900 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Forest Guardians v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 462 F. Supp. \n12  2d 1177, 1183 (D.N.M. 2006); Moden v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 281 F. Supp. 2d \n13  1193, 1206 (D. Or. 2003).  The Center does not dispute that its June and July 2017 \n14  notice letters were sent before any violation could have occurred.  Instead, it asks the \n15  Court to adopt the contrary approach taken in one decision by the District of \n16  Colorado.  Ctr. Br. at 40 (quoting Colo. Envtl. Coal. v. Office of Legacy Mgmt., 819 F. \n17  Supp. 2d 1193, 1219 (D. Colo. 2011)).  This decision is against the weight of more \n18  persuasive authority cited above.63  It incorrectly found that the ESA does not \n19  explicitly address this issue, see id. at 1219, when the ESA’s notice provision in fact \n20 \n                                           \n21 \n63 In finding the case law “divided” on the validity of notices predicting future agency \n22  action, the District of Colorado decision cited only one case, Water Keeper Alliance v. \nU.S. Dep't of Def., 271 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2001). Water Keeper found that the plaintiff’s \n23 \nnotice letter identified an “ongoing delinquency in the [Navy’s] preparation of a \n24  biological assessment,” i.e., an alleged violation by the Navy that existed before and \nafter the notice.  Id. at 30 (emphasis added).  The Center also cites Klamath-Siskiyou \n25 \nMidlands Ctr. v. MacWhorter, 797 F.3d 645, 651-54 (9th Cir. 2015) and Marbled \n26  Murrelet v. Babbitt, 83 F.3d 1068, 1073 (9th Cir. 1996), but defendants there argued \nthat the notice letters were insufficiently detailed (Klamath-Siskiyou) or contemplated \n27 \na suit brought under a different provision of the ESA than ultimately relied upon in the \n28  complaint (Marbled Murrelet), not that that the notices pre-dated any ESA violation. \n  75 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1183   Page 94 of 99\n \n1  requires “written notice of the violation,” 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(A), which \n2  contemplates that the violation exists at the time of the notice.  The decision also \n3  overlooks that an ESA Section 7 violation does not exist until an agency, without ESA \n4  consultation, has “authorized, funded, or carried out” a discretionary “action” that may \n5  affect listed species.  16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); see also 50 C.F.R. § 402.02 (definition \n6  of “action”), id. § 402.03.   Until that point, the agency may modify or limit the effects \n7  of the contemplated action on listed species, making a pre-action notice insufficient to \n8  appraise the agency of how it could further address the plaintiff’s concerns without \n9  litigation, inconsistent with the purpose of the notice requirement.  Sw. Ctr., 143 F.3d \n10  at 520.64  And, of course, while the Center’s insufficient notice provides an additional \n11  ground for dismissal, the Court need not reach this notice issue because the ESA claim \n12  has been extinguished by the waiver.  \n13  Finally, the Center offers no substantive response to Defendant’s showing that \n14  the Court must dismiss the Center’s APA claim regarding the processing of its FOIA \n15  requests because the FOIA itself provides an adequate remedy.  See Defs.’ MTD at \n16  40; Ctr. Br. at 3 n.1 (stating only the belief that “this issue should be addressed by the \n17  Court only if the statutory FOIA claim is not otherwise resolved via settlement”).  \n18  Having established that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim, \n19  Defendants are entitled to dismissal of the Center’s APA claim in Count 7 of its \n20  Second Amended Complaint.  See Brem–Air Disposal v. Cohen, 156 F.3d 1002, 1004 \n21  (9th Cir. 1998); Bedgood v. Mabus, No. 15-454, 2015 WL 3647933, at *4-5 (S.D. Cal. \n22  June 8, 2015). \n23 \n24                                             \n64 The Center claims that any insufficiency of its notice is due to “the lack of \n25 \ninformation available to the Center . . . due to DHS’s decision to waive laws such as \n26  the ESA.”  Ctr. Br. at 40.  But the Center’s notice was inherently speculative, issued \nwell before the waiver decisions were made or any contracts awarded.  See Defs.’ \n27 \nMTD at 39.  This illustrates why it is logical for the statute to require notice of a \n28  “violation,” not a “possible future violation,” before suit can be filed. \n  76 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1184   Page 95 of 99\n \n1  VI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THE REMEDIES THEY SEEK \n2  Defendants have shown that they are entitled to summary judgment and that \n3  Plaintiffs’ motions should be denied.  Nonetheless, if the Court rules for Plaintiffs, \n4  Defendants request the opportunity to provide separate briefing on remedy.  Even if \n5  the Court were to find Defendants’ actions improper, vacatur should not automatically \n6  follow because the Court “is not required to set aside every unlawful agency action.”  \n7  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Espy, 45 F.3d 1337, 1343 (9th Cir. 1995); see also Sierra \n8  Forest Legacy v. Sherman, 951 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1105 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (“It is well \n9  established in this Circuit that a Court is not mechanically obligated to vacate an \n10  agency decision that it finds invalid.”).  Whether agency action should be vacated \n11  depends on a two-factor test:  (1) “how serious the agency’s errors are” and (2) “‘the \n12  disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.’”  Cal. \n13  Cmtys. Against Toxics v. EPA, 688 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Allied–\n14  Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. \n15  1993)).  At this point, given the many varieties of legal claims and their diverse \n16  consequences for remedy issues, it would be inefficient to address the matter before \n17  the Court rules on the merits.  But if the Court rules in Plaintiffs’ favor, Defendants \n18  respectfully request an opportunity to brief these two factors and, in particular, the \n19  potentially disruptive consequences of an order vacating the waiver decisions on the \n20  eve of construction. \n21  CONCLUSION \n22  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant summary judgment to \n23  Defendants on all counts and deny Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on all \n24  counts, with the exception of the Center’s FOIA claim in its Count 7 which is not yet \n25  ripe for disposition. \n26   \n27 \n28 \n  77 \nDefs.’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  17cv1215 GPC (WVG) \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 35-1   Filed 12/20/17   PageID.1185   Page 96 of 99\n \n1  Dated:  December 20, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n2  CHAD A.

This August 2 determination is both ultra vires to the \n10 DHS  Secretary’s  delegated  authority  and  unconstitutional,  and  thus  must  be \n11 reversed and remanded with instructions to DHS that it may only proceed with the \n12 border wall prototype and replacements projects after full compliance with all \n13 legal requirements.  \n14   As  initially  enacted  in  1996,  the  IIRIRA  §102(c)  waiver  authority  was \n15 limited to NEPA and the ESA, but that authority was expanded under the 2005 \n16 REAL ID Act to allow the waiver of any law.  Congress specifically intended the \n17 expansion  of  the  waiver  authority  to  speed  the  completion  of  the  San  Diego \n18 double and triple layer fence required under §102(b), which the agency expedited \n19 through a September 2005 waiver.  However, DHS subsequently used §102(c) on \n20 four  additional  occasions  between  January  2007  and  March  2008  to  expedite \n21 construction of hundreds of additional miles of border barriers required under the \n22 2006 Secure Fence Act, which dramatically expanded the specific border fencing \n23 required under §102(b).  By 2011, the agency had constructed more than 700 \n24 miles  of  border  barriers  and  considered  its  statutory  border  fence  obligations \n25 fulfilled. Congress has not subsequently required any new or additional border \n26 barriers via amendments to IIRIRA or otherwise.  \n27   This prolonged period of relative quiescence was shattered when, within \n28 days of  taking office, on January 25, 2017 President Trump issued the “Border \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   1  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.562   Page 13 of 51\n1 Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvement” Executive Order (“E.O.”), \n2 directing  DHS  to  construct  a  “secure,  contiguous,  and  impassable  physical \n3 barrier”  along  the  entirety  of  the  nearly  2,000  mile-long  U.S.-Mexico  border.  \n4 Although Congress is yet to approve or fund any of the new proposed border wall, \n5 the administration has taken steps to implement the E.O. through the two projects \n6 at issue in this litigation, both located in San Diego—the border wall prototype \n7 project and the border fence replacement project.   \n8   DHS did not release any information to the public regarding either of these \n9 projects, and when it also did not respond to requests for information pursuant to \n10 the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), the Center for Biological Diversity \n11 filed suit in June 2017.  In light of the many environmental risks of the projects, \n12 and  the  environmental  resources  that  could  be  impacted—including  numerous \n13 imperiled species and rare coastal and wetland habitat—the Center amended its \n14 lawsuit to add NEPA and ESA claims in July.  DHS then issued the August 2 \n15 §102(c) waiver.   \n16   The Trump administration’s attempt to revive the §102(c) waiver authority \n17 must be rejected as ultra vires.  As detailed in this brief, the language, structure, \n18 and legislative history of IIRIRA and its amendments demonstrate that the scope \n19 of the §102(c) authority must be limited to specific border barriers identified for \n20 construction  under  §102(b),  rather  than  serving  as  a  roving,  perpetual,  and \n21 unchecked license for DHS to waive laws for any border project, anywhere on any \n22 border (northern or southern), at any time from now to eternity.  Quite simply, the \n23 border wall prototype and replacement projects are not required under §102(b), \n24 and thus are not subject to the §102(c) waiver authority and any such invocation \n25 of a waiver is ultra vires.   \n26   Alternatively, to the degree this Court finds the August 2 waiver to fall \n27 within the scope of the §102(c) waiver authority, that waiver and the underlying \n28 waiver authority are unconstitutional, as they run afoul of the Take  Care  and \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   2  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.563   Page 14 of 51\n1 Presentment clauses of the Constitution, as well the principle of Separation of \n2 Powers and the Nondelegation Doctrine. \n3   The Center should be granted summary judgment on its claims that the \n4 August 2 waiver was ultra vires, and therefore invalid, or in the alternative, that \n5 both the August 2 waiver and the underlying statutory waiver authority of §102(c) \n6 are unconstitutional.1 \n7 LEGAL BACKGROUND \n8 A.  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n9   Section 102 of the 1996 IIRIRA was the first legislative enactment under \n10 which Congress specifically directed the construction of “physical barriers and \n11 roads.”2  P.L. 104-208, div. C., codified at 8 U.S.C. §1103 note.3  IIRIRA §102 \n12 remains  the  primary  federal  statute  specifically  addressing  border  barriers, \n13 pursuant  to  three  main  provisions:  (i)  §102(a)  (describing  the  purpose  of  the \n14 statute); (ii) §102(b) (providing specific mandates and deadlines for border barrier \n15 construction); and (iii) §102(c) (legal waiver authority). \n16   Section 102(a), which remains substantively the same as originally enacted \n17\n                                                 \n18 1 Pursuant to the October 24, 2017 scheduling order (ECF No. 22), DHS’s motion \nto dismiss was converted into a motion for partial summary judgment.  This brief \n19\nis  both  an  opposition  to  that  motion  and  a  cross-motion  for  partial  summary \n20\njudgment. The Center’s FOIA claim (Claim VII) is not subject to these cross-\nmotions and will be resolved either via settlement or separate briefing.  However, \n21\nDHS seeks dismissal of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) portion of the \n22\nFOIA claim that is intertwined with the statutory FOIA claim.  DHS Br. at 40.  \nThe Center believes that this issue should be addressed by the Court only if the \n23\nstatutory FOIA claim is not otherwise resolved via settlement. \n24 2 This authority was originally delegated to the Attorney General, but is now \ndelegated to DHS.  See Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 16) at ¶ 57 n. 1.  \n25\n3 Prior to IIRIRA’s enactment, the authority to construct border barriers derived \n26\nfrom the general statutory responsibility of the Attorney General (now the DHS \nSecretary) to “guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the \n27\nillegal entry of aliens.”  Immigration and Nationality Act, §103(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \n28\n§1103(a)(5). That authority continues to exist independent of IIRIRA. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   3  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.564   Page 15 of 51\n1 in 1996, gives the DHS Secretary the general directive to “take such actions as \n2 may  be  necessary  to  install  additional  physical  barriers  and  roads  .  .  .  in  the \n3 vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high \n4 illegal  entry  into  the  United  States.”    Section  102(b),  in  turn,  “carr[ies]  out \n5 subsection  (a)”  by  identifying  specific  border  barriers  to  be  constructed, \n6 establishing  deadlines  for  the  construction  of  such  barriers,  authorizing  the \n7 acquisition of easements and the appropriation of necessary funds in relation to \n8 the specified border barriers, and other requirements.  Finally, §102(c) provides \n9 the DHS Secretary with authority to waive legal requirements that the Secretary \n10 “determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads \n11 under this section.”   \n12 In the one case to consider the scope of the §102(c) waiver authority, the \n13 court concluded that the authority is limited to the specific barriers identified at \n14 §102(b), which at the time of that decision was the completion of a double and \n15 triple  layer  border  fence  to  further  fortify  the  then  existing  14-mile  long  San \n16 Diego “primary” border fence that had been completed in 1993.  Sierra Club v. \n17 Ashcroft, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, *21 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005) (finding \n18 that “boundaries [of §102(c)] are waiver of laws and regulations which the DHS \n19 Secretary  determines  impede  completion  of  this  particular  14-mile  California \n20 border Triple Fence authorized by IIRIRA.”) (emphasis in original).   \n21   IIRIRA §102 has been amended by three subsequent laws: the 2005 REAL \n22 ID Act, the 2006 Secure Fence Act, and the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations \n23 Act, the first of which modified the waiver authority of §102(c), while the second \n24 and third changed the specific mandates of §102(b).  \n25 B.  The 2005 REAL ID Act Amendments to IIRIRA §102(c)  \n26   Enacted  in  2005  as  an  unrelated  legislative  rider  to  the  “Emergency \n27 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n28 Tsunami Relief, 2005,” (“Supplemental Appropriations Act”) section 102 of the \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   4  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.565   Page 16 of 51\n1 REAL  ID  Act  amended  the  §102(c)  IIRIRA  waiver  provision,  expanding  the \n2 waiver authority, which was initially limited to NEPA and the ESA, to permit the \n3 DHS  Secretary  “to  waive  all  legal  requirements  such  Secretary,  in  such \n4 Secretary’s  sole  discretion,  determines  necessary  to  ensure  expeditious \n5 construction of the barriers and roads under this section.” P.L. 109-13, div. B.  \n6 Section 102 of the REAL ID Act also amended the §102(c) waiver authority to \n7 restrict judicial review in the following respects: limiting “all causes or claims” \n8 arising from any waiver determination made by the DHS Secretary to alleged \n9 constitutional violations; requiring any such constitutional challenge to be filed \n10 not  later  than  60  days  after  the  Secretary’s  determination;  and  eliminating \n11 appellate court review of the district court’s decision on the alleged constitutional \n12 violations, instead only permitting review upon a writ of certiorari to the Supreme \n13 Court.  The focus of §102(b) of IIRIRA solely on the San Diego fence remained \n14 unchanged by this amendment. \n15 C.  The 2006 Secure Fence Act Amendments to IIRIRA §102(b)  \n16   Section 3 of the 2006 Secure Fence Act (“Construction of Fencing and \n17 Security Improvements in Border Area from Pacific Ocean to Gulf of Mexico”) \n18 significantly expanded upon IIRIRA §102(b) and its previous sole focus on the \n19 14-mile  San  Diego  double  and  triple  layer  fence  construction.    P.L.  109-367.  \n20 Under these amendments, Congress directed DHS to “provide for at least 2 layers \n21 of reinforced fencing [and] the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, \n22 lighting, cameras, and sensors” in five specific segments along the U.S.-Mexico \n23 border totaling approximately 850 miles.  IIRIRA, former §102(b)(1)(A)(i)-(v).    \n24 Section 3 further amended IIRIRA section 102(b) to add the specific requirement \n25 that  two  of  these  segments  be  considered  “priority  areas,”  with  construction \n26 deadlines  of  May  30,  2008  and  December  31,  2008.

The  2008  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  Amendments  to  IIRIRA \n2   §102(b) \n3   Just over a year after enactment of the Secure Fence Act, Section 564 of the \n4 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act again amended §102(b) of the IIRIRA to \n5 scale back DHS’s duties with respect to border barriers and roads that had been \n6 mandated under the 2006 Secure Fence Act amendments. P.L. 110-161, div. E. \n7 These amendments—which remain the law today—include: (1) eliminating the \n8 requirement that border barriers be built in any specific locations, and instead \n9 specifying  that  such  barriers  be  placed  “along  not  less  than  700  miles  of  the \n10 southwest  border  where  fencing  would  be  most  practical  and  effective”;  (2) \n11 eliminating  the  requirement  of  double-layered  fencing;  and  (3)  amending  the \n12 “priority areas” requirement to direct that DHS identify and construct 370 miles of \n13 border barriers by December 31, 2008.  IIRIRA § 102(b)(1)(A)-(B).4  Congress \n14 did not specifically consider the impact of the Consolidated Appropriations Act \n15 amendments on the scope of the IIRIRA §102(c) waiver. \n16 FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Prior  IIRIRA  §102(c)  Waivers  to  Expedite  Construction  of  Border \n17\n  Barriers Required Under IIRIRA §102(b)  \n18   In response to IIRIRA and its amendments, DHS has greatly increased the \n19 extent  of  border  barriers  and  roads  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border.  The \n20 overwhelming  majority  of  border  fence  construction  was  approved  during  the \n21 second term of the George W. Bush Administration, and was facilitated by five \n22 “notices of determination” in the Federal Register invoking the IIRIRA §102(c) \n23\n                                                 \n24 4  In  addition,  the  2008  Appropriations  Act  also  added  a  new  consultation \nrequirement to §102(b), directing that DHS “shall consult with the Secretary of \n25\nthe Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, States, local governments, Indian tribes, \n26\nand  property  owners  in  the  United  States  to  minimize  the  impact  on  the \nenvironment,  culture,  commerce,  and  quality  of  life  for  the  communities  and \n27\nresidents located near the sites where” border barriers are constructed.

As of February 2017, DHS had constructed \n5 a total of 654 miles of “primary” border barriers, an additional 50 miles of double \n6 and  triple-layered  border  barriers  (for  a  total  of  704  miles  of  barriers),  and \n7 approximately  5,000  miles  of  roads  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border.  See \n8 “Southwest border security: Additional actions needed to better assess fencing’s \n9 contributions to operations and provide guidance for identifying capability gaps.” \n10 U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  (“GAO”)  Report  17-331,  a  report  to \n11 congressional requesters (February 2017).7   \n12   Regardless of whether the total mileage of existing barriers is calculated as \n13 654 or 704 miles, DHS has taken the position that IIRIRA §102(b) allows less \n14 than 700 miles of fencing to be constructed in the agency’s discretion, and that it \n15\n                                                 \n16 5 All five of these determinations waived application of NEPA and the ESA, as \nwell  as  the  Clean  Water  Act,  33  U.S.C.  §  1251  et  seq.;  National  Historic \n17\nPreservation Act, Pub.

With 654 miles of primary fencing \n4\ncurrently  deployed,  CBP  officials  have  stated  that  CBP  is  in \ncompliance  with  its  legal  requirements  for  the  construction  of  the \n5\nsouthwest border fencing on the substantial discretion provided to the \n6 Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  determine  the  appropriate \nplacement of fencing. \n7  \n8 Id., at p. 8. In short, DHS has completed the construction mandates of §102(b). \n \n9 B.  The January 25, 2017 Executive Order on Border Security and \n    Immigration Enforcement Improvement \n10\n \n11   The January 25, 2017 E.O. directs DHS to construct a “secure, contiguous, \n12 and impassable physical barrier” along the entirety of the nearly 2,000 mile-long \n13 U.S.-Mexico border, and defines that structure to mean “a contiguous, physical \n14 wall or similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.”  By its \n15 plain terms, the E.O. breaks with the previous and longstanding DHS position that \n16 additional border barrier construction is unnecessary and that DHS had already \n17 fulfilled its statutory obligations under IIRIRA §102(b).  \n \n18\nC.  The  San  Diego  Border  Wall  Prototype  and  Border  Fence \nReplacement Projects \n19\n \n20\n  The border wall prototype project is the culmination of two Requests for \n21\nProposals (“RFPs”) issued pursuant to the E.O. in March 2017—one for a “Solid \n22\nConcrete  Border  Wall  Prototype”  and  the  second  for  an  “Other  Border  Wall \n23\nPrototype.”  The core of the “threshold requirements” is that the wall design “shall \n24\nbe  physically  imposing  in  height,”  with  a  preference  for  a  30-foot  high  wall.  \n25\nEight  prototypes  were  recently  constructed,  and  according  to  the  Center’s \n26\ninformation and belief, are currently being tested. The prototype location is within \n27\nor in close proximity to seasonal wetland vernal pool habitat, and other occupied \n28\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   8  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.569   Page 20 of 51\n1 endangered species habitat.  \n2    The border wall replacement project would replace the existing 14-mile \n3 primary and secondary fencing in San Diego County, within habitat for numerous \n4 ESA-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species,  and  their  designated  critical \n5 habitat.  The proposed 30-foot high replacement wall is notably higher than the \n6 existing border fencing, and may be constructed of impermeable concrete, both of \n7 which would exacerbate environmental impacts of the existing border fencing.  \n8 Even though this region is impacted by prior border fence construction and other \n9 activities  and  infrastructure,  the  border  wall  replacement  project  is  a  major \n10 construction project with significant environmental impacts.   \n \n11\nD.  The August 2, 2017 IIRIRA §102(c) Waiver for “Various Border \n    Infrastructure Projects” in a Fifteen Mile “Project Area” \n12  \n13   On  August  2,  2017,  the  DHS  Secretary  issued  the  first  determination \n14 purporting to invoke IIRIRA § 102(c) in nearly a decade, waiving the application \n15 of NEPA, the ESA, and more than 30 additional laws not at issue in this lawsuit to \n16 “various border infrastructure projects” in the “project area.” 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984-\n17 85.  The determination defines the “project area” as “an approximately fifteen \n18 mile segment of the border within the San Diego Sector that starts at the Pacific \n19 Ocean  and  extends  eastward  …  to  approximately  one  mile  east  of  Border \n20 Monument 251.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 35,985.   DHS did not provide any prior notice, \n21 conduct any public meetings, or consult with any stakeholders prior to issuing the \n22 August 2 waiver. \n23   The  border  wall  prototype  and  replacement  projects  are  only  listed  as \n24 “examples” of the “various border infrastructure projects” DHS “will immediately \n25 implement” within the fifteen mile segment in the waiver determination.  Id. at \n26 35984.  It thus appears that DHS intends to apply the waiver to projects which are \n27 not described in the determination, and for which plans may not even yet exist. \n28 Although  existing  border  fencing  covers  much  of  the  “project  area,”  the \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   9  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.570   Page 21 of 51\n1 easternmost portion is unfenced and within habitat for several endangered species.  \n2 E.  Procedural History \n3   In May 2017, the Center made requests pursuant to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, \n4 from  DHS  and  CBP  for  records  related  to  the  border  wall  prototype  and \n5 replacement projects and agency compliance with NEPA and the ESA.  When the \n6 agencies failed to provide a timely response, the Center filed the present case \n7 (ECF No. 1), and subsequently amended the complaint to add NEPA claims (ECF \n8 No.  6).  Following  the  August  2,  2017  §102(c)  waiver,  the  parties  entered  a \n9 scheduling stipulation under which the Center filed its second amended complaint, \n10 which alleges ultra vires and constitutional claims against the August 2 waiver, \n11 and  also  adds  ESA  claims  (ECF  No.  16).    The  Center’s  case  has  now  been \n12 consolidated with subsequent challenges to the August 2 waiver by Defenders of \n13 Wildlife, et al., and the State of California (ECF No. 22). \n14 ARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Has Jurisdiction to Hear the Center’s Ultra Vires Claim \n15  \n16   As demonstrated in Section II below, the August 2 waiver is ultra vires as it \n17 exceeds the authority granted to DHS under IIRIRA §102.  However, DHS asserts \n18 that this Court can never reach the Center’s ultra vires claims because §102(c) \n19 precludes judicial review.  DHS Br. at 9-15.  Defendants are simply wrong.  While \n20 §102(c) may define certain limits on the timing and process of judicial review, it \n21 cannot be read to preclude review of claims that DHS acted beyond the bounds of \n22 its delegated authority. \n23 Interpreting the scope of the IIRIRA §102(c) waiver provision “begin[s] \n24 with  the  strong  presumption  that  Congress  intends  judicial  review  of \n25 administrative action.”   Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 \n26 U.S.  667,  670  (1986).8    Critically,  this  strong  presumption  applies  even  to  a \n27                                                  \n8  Ignoring  this  clearly  articulated  and  longstanding  Supreme  Court  precedent, \n28\nDHS asserts a presumption of nonreviewability based on Columbia Riverkeeper v. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   10  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.571   Page 22 of 51\n1 provision  such  as  §102(c)(2),  “where  the  statute  expressly  prohibits  judicial \n2 review—in other words, the presumption dictates that such provisions must be \n3 read narrowly.”  El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. United States, 632 F.3d 1272, 1276 \n4 (D.C. Cir. 2011); cf. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. \n5 402, 410 (1971) (APA exception for judicial review of actions “committed to \n6 agency discretion” is “a very narrow exception”).9 \n7   Here, the Center does not dispute that Congress has demonstrated its intent \n8 to overcome the presumption favoring judicial review of non-constitutional claims \n9 regarding a waiver issued pursuant to IIRIRA §102(c)(1): \n \n10 (2) Federal Court Review. (A) In General. The district courts . . . shall \nhave exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from \n11 any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the [DHS Secretary] \npursuant to paragraph (1). A cause of action or claim may only be \n12 brought alleging a violation of the Constitution . . . The Court shall \nnot  have  jurisdiction  to  hear  any  claim  not  specified  in  this \n13\nsubparagraph. \n14 IIRIRA §102(c)(2) (emphasis added).  But as detailed in section II below, the \n15 August 2 waiver was not authorized by §102 and therefore is not a decision made \n16 “pursuant to” IIRIRA §102(c)(1).  Accordingly, the August 2 waiver is ultra vires \n17 and subject to review by this court, and the §102(c)(2) judicial review restrictions \n18 are simply inapplicable. \n19   Stated another way, DHS cannot hide behind the judicial review restrictions \n20 of §102(c)(2) in order to escape review of whether the August 2 waiver was in \n21 fact properly within the scope of §102(c)(1) to begin with.  As the D.C. Circuit \n22 explained in upholding jurisdiction for an ultra vires claim in Dart v. United \n23 States, 848 F.2d 217 at 224 (D.C. Cir. 1988), “the Veterans’ Administrator cannot \n24 issue  oil  drilling  permits—nor  can  the  Secretary  of  Labor  rescind  television \n25                                                                                                                                                             \nU.S. Coast Guard, 761 F.3d 1084, 1091 (9th Cir. 2014).  That case, however, \n26\ninvolved plaintiffs’ attempt to invoke original jurisdiction at the appellate level, \nnot whether any jurisdiction existed to begin with.  DHS Br. at 9-10. \n27\n9  Unless  stated  otherwise,  internal  citations  and  quotations  within  cases  are \n28\nomitted. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   11  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.572   Page 23 of 51\n1 licenses—and expect to escape judicial review by hiding behind a finality clause.”    \n2   In Dart, the court considered whether a citizen charged with violating an \n3 export  law  could  bring  a  claim  challenging  the  enforcement  action \n4 notwithstanding a preclusive statutory review provision.  In holding that ultra \n5 vires  review  was  available,  the  court  found  that  the  “presumption  of  judicial \n6 review is particularly strong where an agency is alleged to have acted beyond its \n7 authority.”  848 F.2d at 223. \n8   The necessity of ultra vires judicial review of agency action was recognized \n9 by the Supreme Court long before Dart, in American School of Magnetic Healing \n10 v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902) (upholding jurisdiction over claim that \n11 postmaster acted ultra vires).  The doctrine was reaffirmed during passage of the \n12 Administrative Procedure Act. See S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 26 \n13 (1945) (Senate Judiciary Committee report accompanying the APA) (“It has never \n14 been the policy of Congress to prevent the administration of its own statutes from \n15 being judicially confined to the scope of authority granted or to the objectives \n16 specified”) (quoted in Dart, 848 F.2d at 224).  And it has been recently invoked to \n17 hear the legality of other actions taken by the current administration.  Hawaii v. \n18 Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 768-69 (9th Cir. 2017) (“We do not abdicate the judicial \n19 role, and we affirm our obligation ‘to say what the law is’ in this case”) (quoting \n20 Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803)(vacated as moot). \n21   Moreover,  courts have repeatedly and specifically applied the presumption \n22 of ultra vires review to actions purportedly taken pursuant to statutory provisions \n23 expressly  precluding  judicial  review  such  as  that  in  §102(c).  In  interpreting \n24 another  provision  of  IIRIRA  limiting  judicial  review,  for  example,  the  Ninth \n25 Circuit noted that “[e]ven if a statute gives the Attorney General discretion . . . the \n26 courts retain jurisdiction to review whether a particular decision is ultra vires [to] \n27 the statute in question.”  Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, \n28 689 (9th Cir. 2003); Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, 436 U.S. 631, 638 n. 17 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   12  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.573   Page 24 of 51\n1 (1978)  (“[A]lthough  we  reaffirm  our  previous  holding  that  courts  may  not \n2 independently appraise the reasonableness of rates, no such appraisal is involved \n3 in inquiring whether the Commission has overstepped the bounds of its authority.  \n4 Therefore, we conclude that Congress did not mean to cut off judicial review for \n5 such limited purposes”); United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1044 n. 8 (9th \n6 Cir.  1992)(“claims  that  an  agency  acted  outside  the  scope  of  its  delegated \n7 authority” are reviewable under the Dart standard).10   \n8 As explained by the D.C. Circuit:  \n \n9\nIf a no-review provision shields particular types of [executive] action, \na court may not inquire whether a challenged [executive] decision is \n10\narbitrary, capricious, or procedurally defective, but it must determine \nwhether the challenged . . . action is of the sort shielded from review.  \n11\nOtherwise,  agencies  could  characterize  reviewable  or  unauthorized \n12 action  as  falling  within  the  scope  of  no-review  provisions  whose \napplication to such action Congress did not intend.   \n13  \nAmgen v. Smith, 357 F.3d 103, 113 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \n14\n  Despite this extensive precedent, DHS asserts that the Center cannot bring \n15\nan ultra vires challenge because §102(c) uses an “unambiguous ‘shall not have \n16\njurisdiction’ formulation,” and “Congress could not have been clearer in stating \n17\nthat all non-constitutional claims are barred.”  DHS Br. at 11-12.  In Bozarov, \n18\nhowever, the Ninth Circuit held precisely the opposite, concluding that a claim \n19\n20\n                                                 \n10 See also Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck Indian Reservation v. Board \n21\nof Oil & Gas Conservation, 792 F.2d 782, 791-92 (9th Cir. 1986) (“Courts have \n22\nwidely held that claims that an agency has acted outside its statutory authority are \nreviewable  even  though  its  decision  on  the  merits  might  be  unreviewable  as \n23\ncommitted to agency discretion.”); Nadler v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 657 F.2d 453, \n24\n456  (D.C.  Cir.  1981)  (“Where,  as  here,  the  claim  is  that  it  was  beyond  the \nprovince  of  the  agency  to  adopt  as  a  rule  a  certain  suspension  policy,  the \n25\nreviewability-of-suspension  orders  doctrine  is  simply  inapplicable”);  Owens  v. \n26\nHills, 450 F. Supp. 218, 221 (N.D. Ill. 1978) (“Concepts of ‘separation of powers’ \nand ‘unlawful delegation of legislative power’ mandate judicial review of certain \n27\nagency action even in the face of a judicial review preclusion statute to insure that \n28\nan agency has not clearly violated its statutory duty.”) \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   13  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.574   Page 25 of 51\n1 that  an  agency  acted  outside  the  scope  of  its  delegated  authority  would  be \n2 reviewable despite a judicial review provision even more preclusive than IIRIRA \n3 §102(c), stating simply that the Secretary of Commerce’s denial of a validated \n4 export license “shall be final and is not subject to judicial review.”  974 F.2d at \n5 1039 (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 2412(e)).  In that case, the court rejected plaintiff’s \n6 constitutional claim that the law in question violated the nondelegation doctrine, \n7 but noted that “we believe that claims that the Secretary acted in excess of his \n8 delegated authority under the EAA are … reviewable.”  Id. at 1044-45.     \n9   As  detailed  in  Dart,  numerous  courts  in  addition  to  Bozarov  have \n10 consistently  permitted  judicial  review  of  facial  and  ultra  vires  claims  despite \n11 provisions  even  more  preclusive  than  §102(c).    In  the  disability  rights  case \n12 Lindahl v. OPM, for example, the Supreme Court found that judicial review was \n13 available to determine whether there had been “a misconstruction of the governing \n14 statute,” despite a finality provision stating that the decisions at issue “shall be \n15 final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review.”  470 U.S. 768, 791 \n16 (1985)(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 8347(c)).  The Dart court further noted that several \n17 Circuits  have  held  veterans’  benefit  law  permits  review  of  regulations  that \n18 allegedly  violate  the  statute  despite  “sweeping  preclusion language”  providing \n19 that any decision involving benefits “shall be final and conclusive and no other \n20 official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review \n21 any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.”  848 \n22 F.2d at 225.  The same applies here, and §102(c)(2) cannot be held to bar the \n23 Center from alleging an ultra vires claim in this case. \n24   In  another  variation  on  the  “plain  language”  argument,  DHS  states  that \n25 “Plaintiff cannot evade this clear jurisdictional limitation by citing the series of \n26 cases applying Leedom v. Kyne,” because “Kyne does not apply where ‘Congress \n27 has spoken clearly and directly’ to preclude review.” DHS Br. at 12 (quoting \n28 Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184 (1958)).  In doing so, DHS places great emphasis \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   14  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.575   Page 26 of 51\n1 on Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin. Inc., 502 U.S. 32 \n2 (1991), in which the court found that “the clarity of the congressional preclusion \n3 of review” contrasted with implied review at issue in Kyne.   \n4   The Center, however, is not primarily relying upon the Kyne line of cases, \n5 which generally involve “implied rather than express” preclusive language.  Nyunt \n6 v.  Chairman,  Broad  Bd.  of  Governors,  589  F.3d  445,  449  (D.C.  Cir.  2009).  \n7 Instead, plaintiff traces its ultra vires claim of jurisdiction to American School of \n8 Magnetic Healing, as well as Dart and related cases that are specific to situations \n9 in which Congress has expressly restricted judicial review.  The Dart standard of \n10 review was specifically endorsed by the Ninth Circuit in Bozarov, in which the \n11 court also specifically stated that MCorp does not preclude claims that an agency \n12 acted  outside  the  scope  of  its  delegated  authority  under  statutory  provisions \n13 precluding judicial review: \n \n14 The government suggested at oral argument that the Court’s recent \ndecision in [MCorp] means that claims that an agency acted outside \n15 the scope of its delegated authority are not reviewable if the statute \nprecludes judicial review. We do not believe that MCorp precludes \n16\nthis  type  of  claim  under  the  EAA.  The  Court  emphasized  that \npreclusion of review was acceptable in part because the petitioner had \n17\na  meaningful  and  adequate  opportunity  for  judicial  review  of  the \nregulation that he argued was promulgated in excess of the agency’s \n18\nstatutory authority.  The EAA presents an entirely different situation; \n19 petitioners have no other opportunity to challenge regulations or their \napplications.  We therefore believe that Dart still sets out the correct \n20 standard to be applied to the EAA. \n \n21 Bozarov, 974 F.2d at 1045 n. 8; see also Hanauer v. Reich, 82 F.3d 1304, 1309 \n22 (4th Cir. 1996) (citing Bozarov) (“The Ninth Circuit has explicitly rejected the \n23 argument that under MCorp, a statute that generally precludes judicial review \n24 necessarily precludes judicial review of claims that an agency exceeded the scope \n25 of its delegated authority.”).    In light of the above, the court has jurisdiction to \n26 hear the Center’s ultra vires claim.  \n \n27 II.  The  IIRIRA  §102(c)  Waiver  Authority  Does  Not  Extend  to  the \n  Border Wall Prototype and Border Fence Replacement Projects, and \n28\n  thus the August 2 Waiver is Ultra Vires   \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   15  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.576   Page 27 of 51\n1   The  core  dispute  between  the  parties  is  whether  the  waiver  authority \n2 contained in §102(c) is limited to those specific projects mandated by Congress in \n3 §102(b) (and which have already been completed), as the Center contends, or \n4 whether it is applicable to a much broader, unbounded and perpetual grant of \n5 authority purportedly contained in §102(a), as DHS asserts.  The plain language \n6 and structure of the statute, its purpose and legislative history, as well as legal \n7 precedent all dictate that the narrow reading advanced by the Center is the only \n8 permissible interpretation of the statute.  DHS’s interpretation, and consequently \n9 the August 2 waiver issued based on that interpretation, must be rejected as ultra \n10 vires. \n     \n11\n  A.  IIRIRA  §102’s  Language  and  Structure  Demonstrate  that  the \n    Scope  of  the  §102(c)  Waiver  Authority  is  Limited  to  Specific \n12\n    Border Barriers Required Under §102(b) \n13    “Statutory construction is a holistic endeavor.”  Koons Buick Pontiac GMC \n14 v. Nigh, 543 U.S. 50, 60 (2004).  In order to determine how Congress has spoken \n15 to the question at issue, a court should read the words of the statute “in their \n16 context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.”  FDA v. \n17 Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000).  In addition, \n18 courts “must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which \n19 Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political \n20 magnitude to  an  administrative  agency.”  Id.  Guided  by  these  principles,  the \n21 authority granted to the DHS Secretary under IIRIRA §102(c) to waive all legal \n22 requirements  the  Secretary  “determines  necessary  to  ensure  expeditious \n23 construction of the barriers and roads under this section” must be interpreted as \n24 limited to specific border barriers mandated pursuant to §102(b). \n25   In the sole judicial decision to address the scope of §102(c), a court in this \n26 district  reached  precisely  this  conclusion,  finding  that  the  waiver’s  reach  was \n27 limited to the completion of the San Diego 14-mile double and triple layer border \n28 fence—the only specific fence segment required under §102(b) at that time.  As \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   16  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.577   Page 28 of 51\n1 stated in that case, which involved a challenge to the DHS Secretary’s first use of \n2 the waiver authority:  \n \n3\n[T]he  ‘barriers  and  roads’  alluded  to  are  in  the  same  in  both \narticulations [as originally enacted in 1996 and as amended by the \n4\nREAL ID Act of 2005] of Section 102(c): the Triple Fence project \n5 located along the U.S.-Mexico border in the vicinity of San Diego . . . \nCongress simply broadened the scope of the waiver authority of the \n6 pre-existing delegation to ‘all laws,’ but again only for the narrow \npurpose of expeditious completion of the Triple Fence authorized by \n7 the IIRIRA. \n8 Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005)  \n9 at *19-20 (emphasis added).  The court repeatedly and definitively emphasized \n10 this limitation throughout the opinion.  Id. at *20 (“[t]hose boundaries are waivers \n11 of laws and regulations which the DHS Secretary determines impede construction \n12 of  this  particular  14-mile  California  Triple  Fence  authorized  by  IIRIRA”) \n13 (emphasis in original); id. at 37 n. 7 (“this legislation since its inception is highly \n14 specific to a particular project in a specific location.”).11  The Court was so certain \n15 of its interpretation that it declined to review legislative history. Id. at *32-33 \n16 (“congressional intent in the revision is clear from the subject matter of Section \n17 102(c): expedite completion of the [San Diego] Triple Fence … the language of \n18 the congressional enactment cannot be construed otherwise than as specifically \n19 targeting the subject matter of this case.”). \n20   Notwithstanding Sierra Club’s repeated and emphatic language limiting the \n21 scope  of  the  §102(c)  waiver  authority  to  construction  required  under  §102(b) \n22 (which at that time was only the San Diego Triple Fence), DHS describes the \n23 projects covered by its August 2 waiver as falling “within the scope of § 102(a), \n24 which gives the Secretary authority ‘to take such actions as may be necessary to \n25 install additional physical barriers and roads.’” DHS Br. at 23. DHS further asserts \n26 that the §102(c) waiver authority applies to the projects because the authority “by \n27                                                  \n11  As  discussed  in  Section  III,  infra,  the  court  also  relied  on  this  narrow \n28\ninterpretation in finding that the waiver did not violate the nondelegation doctrine.  \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   17  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.578   Page 29 of 51\n1 its plain terms . . . extends to any construction” proposed under §102 and that the \n2 term “this section” under §102(c) “unambiguously refers to IIRIRA §102 as a \n3 whole.”  DHS  Br.  at  17.  In  doing  so,  DHS  places  particular  emphasis  on  its \n4 assertion that “[w]hen Congress wanted to identify a specific unit within §102, it \n5 did so in the standardized format.”  Id.   \n6   Presuming  that  Congress  has  intentionally  adhered  to  the  standardized \n7 format for making internal references within §102, an analysis of the broader \n8 “plain language” structure of §102 shows that DHS undermines its own argument.  \n9 For  example,  §102(b)(2)-(4),  which  address  easements,  safety  features,  and \n10 appropriations,  respectively,  all  specifically  refer  to  “this  subsection”  (i.e. \n11 subsection (b)). See §102(b)(2) (directing Attorney General12 to “promptly acquire \n12 such easements as may be necessary to carry out this subsection”); §102(b)(3) \n13 (directing Attorney General to “while constructing the additional fencing under \n14 this  subsection,  incorporate  such  safety  features  into  the  design  of  the  fence \n15 system as are necessary to ensure the well-being of border patrol agents deployed \n16 within or in near proximity”); §102(b)(4) (authorizing the appropriation of “such \n17 sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection.”).   \n18   Because Congress has provided these authorizations specific to §102(b), it \n19 must be presumed that it did not provide those authorizations for actions taken \n20 beyond  §102(b).  Gozlon-Peretz  v.  United  States,  498  U.S.  395,  404  (1991) \n21 (“Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but \n22 omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \n23 acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion”).  Without \n24 appropriations,  easements,  or  safety  measures,  border  barriers  cannot  be \n25 constructed, and DHS’s attempt to justify its expansive reading of §102(c) solely \n26 on that provision’s reference to ‘this section’ collapses.  \n27                                                  \n12 As these portions of §102(b) were not amended in the 2005 amendments they \n28\nrefer to the Attorney General rather than the DHS Secretary. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   18  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.579   Page 30 of 51\n1   Other aspects of IIRIRA show that it is not the model of plain language \n2 clarity that DHS represents it to be, further undermining the DHS’s contention \n3 that  §102(c)’s  reference  to  “barriers  and  roads  under  this  section”  is \n4 “unambiguous” and must be interpreted to apply to all actions taken under §102.  \n5 As  one  example  of  this  legislative  imprecision,  the  terms  “section”  and \n6 “subsection” are used inconsistently under §102, with §102(b)(1)(A) addressing \n7 “reinforced fencing” required to “carry[] out subsection(a),” while §102(b)(1)(B) \n8 and §102(b)(1)(C) address “priority areas” of “carry[] out this section.”13   \n9 In addition to its plain meaning argument, DHS asserts that limiting the \n10 §102(c)  waiver  authority  to  specific  barriers  identified  in  §102(b)  is  “highly \n11 implausible”  for  four  reasons,  the  first  being  that  “when  Congress  identifies \n12 certain  specific  applications  of  a  general  grant  of  authority,  those  specific \n13 requirements cannot generally be understood to prohibit all other applications of \n14 the general authority,” and the second and third related arguments that such a \n15 reading would render §102(a) superfluous and that §102(b) does not foreclose \n16 other applications of §102(a). DHS Br. at 18-21.14   \n17   DHS mischaracterizes the Center’s claim. The Center alleges, simply, that \n18 the  scope  of  the  §102(c)  waiver  authority  does  not  apply  to  the  border  wall \n19 prototype or replacement projects, or to any other actions that are not mandated by \n20 Congress pursuant to §102(b).  The Center, however, does not claim that DHS \n21 lacks authority to construct border barriers in San Diego or elsewhere.   \n22 Prior  to  IIRIRA’s  enactment,  the  authority  to  construct  border  barriers \n23 derived from the general statutory responsibility of the Attorney General (now the \n24\n                                                 \n13 One court interpreting IIRIRA bemoaned the “various jurisdictional Gordian \n25\nknots” created by the law, and noted that the analysis was “further complicat[ed]” \n26\nby the REAL ID Act amendments.  Baeta v. Sonchik, 273 F.3d 1261, 1263 (9th \nCir. 2001) (quoted in Sissko v. Rocha, 412 F.3d 1021, 1029 (9th Cir. 2005)).   \n27\n14  The  fourth  (pertaining  to  legislative  history)  is  addressed  in  Section  II.B., \n28\nbelow. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   19  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.580   Page 31 of 51\n1 DHS Secretary) to “guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against \n2 the illegal entry of aliens.” Immigration and Nationality Act, §103(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \n3 §1103(a)(5).  Pursuant  to  such  authority,  various  fences  and  barriers  were \n4 constructed in the San Diego area well before §102 came into existence.  That \n5 authority  continues  to  exist  independent  of  §102.  Consequently,  the  broad \n6 directives of §102(a) cannot be interpreted as providing DHS with the authority to \n7 build  border  barriers  as  that  authority  already  exists  independent  of  §102(a).  \n8 What  IIRIRA  did  was  to  require  specific  border  barriers  under  §102(b),  and \n9 provide authority to waive laws that might delay the expeditious construction of \n10 those barriers.  But that authority to issue waivers does not extend beyond those \n11 specific border barrier projects required by §102(b).  So while DHS may have the \n12 authority  to  construct  the  border  wall  prototype  and  replacement  projects,  the \n13 §102(c) waiver authority is not applicable to such projects, and DHS may instead \n14 only legally proceed with these proposals after complying with all applicable legal \n15 requirements, including those of NEPA and the ESA.  \n16 DHS  claims  that  this  construction  of  IIRIRA  renders  §102(a)  “largely \n17 superfluous.” DHS Br. at 20.  This is simply not the case. While many statutes \n18 have  introductory  provisions  titled  “In  General”  that  consist  largely  of  non-\n19 binding  pronouncements  of  policy,  §102(a)  actually  contains  meaningful \n20 provisions. Through its plain language it limits the barriers and roads DHS may \n21 construct under §102(b) to those areas “in the vicinity of the United States border” \n22 and which are erected “to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into \n23 the United States.”  There is nothing superfluous about these requirements, and in \n24 fact the limitation of such projects to “areas of high illegal entry” is central to \n25 certain claims in this case. \n26   DHS’s claim that the Center’s interpretation would lead to “absurd results” \n27 also crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.  DHS Brief, at p. 24.  DHS asserts that \n28 limiting  the  waiver  authority  to  projects  under  §102(b)  would  preclude \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   20  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.581   Page 32 of 51\n1 maintenance,  repair  or  improvement  of  existing  barriers.  Id.  However,  as \n2 described above, DHS has authority for such activities outside of §102; it simply \n3 would not be allowed to waive environmental and other laws under §102(c) to \n4 carry out such measures.  However, this is not a heavy burden, as it is hard to \n5 imagine how repairing a hole in a fence would trigger the requirement to prepare a \n6 lengthy Environmental Impact Statement or a prolonged analysis under the ESA.  \n7 DHS’s strawman arguments simply do not carry any weight.  That DHS may wish \n8 that the broad waiver authority of §102(c) was applicable to every project and \n9 action it may decide to undertake, does not make it so.  \n10   While DHS decries the Center’s “cramped reading,” DHS’s expansive and \n11 unbounded interpretation of the §102(c) waiver authority would bestow a truly \n12 extraordinary and unprecedented “free pass” upon DHS to bypass any laws for \n13 any border barrier or road construction project at any time, with such authority to \n14 persist into the future in perpetuity.  If DHS is permitted to utilize the authority in \n15 2017,  then  what  is  to  prevent  future  administrations  from  waiving  legal \n16 requirements in 2027, or 2057?  Yet this is just one aspect of the ramifications \n17 flowing from DHS’s breezy claim of authority to waive all laws pertaining to all \n18 border infrastructure projects now and in the future.  \n19   For example, under DHS’s interpretation, the waiver authority would apply \n20 not only to border barrier construction, and not only prototypes and replacements \n21 such as the projects at issue here, but barrier and road projects constructed away \n22 from the immediate border and any other project DHS deems is within the scope \n23 of §102(a).  Under this interpretation, the scope of this authority would apply to \n24 any  area  of  proposed  border  wall  construction,  regardless  of  whether  such \n25 construction is proposed within the boundaries of a National Park, Monument, \n26 Wildlife Refuge, Forest, Wilderness, or other area of protected federal, state, or \n27 local, land, or on a citizen’s private lands.  If DHS’s interpretation were accepted, \n28 the agency could propose a wall along the length of the Canadian border, waive \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   21  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.582   Page 33 of 51\n1 all applicable laws, and build it without any further authorization from Congress. \n2 It is DHS’s interpretation that leads to absurd results.15    \n3   DHS’s sweeping claim of legal waiver authority cannot be upheld.  Reading \n4 IIRIRA’s provisions together, and considering the presumption favoring judicial \n5 review  and  requiring  a  narrow  interpretation  of  waivers,  the  most  reasonable \n6 interpretation of IIRIRA §102 as a whole is that the §102(c) waiver authority is \n7 limited to specific barriers which Congress has identified in §102(b). Gutierrez de \n8 Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U.S. 417, 434 (1995) (“When a statute is reasonably \n9 susceptible to divergent interpretation, we adopt the reading that accords with \n10 traditional  understandings  and  basic  principles:  that  executive  determinations \n11 generally are subject to judicial review.”). \n  \n12\nB.  IIRIRA’s  Legislative  History  Demonstrates  that  Congress \n13   Intended  to  Limit  the  Scope  of  the  §102(c)  Waiver  Authority \n  to Specific Border Barriers Required Under §102(b)  \n14\n \n15   Section 102 of the 2005 REAL ID Act (H.R. 418) amended the §102(c) \n16 waiver  provision  to  its  current  language.  P.L.  109-13,  div.  B.  There  were  no \n17 Committee hearings held on H.R. 418 in either chamber of Congress, and the \n18 bill’s debate was limited to portions of two days in the House on February 9, 2005 \n19 (151 Cong. Rec. H453-471) and February 10, 2005 (151 Cong. Rec. H527-566).  \n20   H.R. 418 was never specifically considered in the Senate, as it was added as \n21 an unrelated legislative rider to the Supplemental Appropriations Act during that \n22 bill’s conference committee.  As stated by one Senator, the REAL ID Act “was \n23 simply grafted onto the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that provides \n24\n                                                 \n15 Given §102(a) speaks only of “the United States border” without specifying the \n25\nsouthern border, under DHS’s interpretation of the scope of the waiver authority. \n26\nthe agency could theoretically invoke a waiver to build a dam across the Bering \nStrait to separate the United States from Russia without any further authorization \n27\nof Congress and such action would be unreviewable by the courts as within the \n28\n“discretion” of the DHS Secretary.  IIRIRA cannot be so interpreted. \n \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   22  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.583   Page 34 of 51\n1 funding for our military operations and our troops, without debate or participation \n2 by the conferees.”  151 Cong. Rec. S4820 (daily ed. May 10, 2005) (Statement of \n3 Senator Byrd). \n4   Although  the  REAL  ID  Act’s  legislative  history  is  relatively  sparse,  it \n5 unequivocally shows the sponsor’s and supporters’ intent to limit the expanded \n6 IIRIRA §102(c) waiver authority to the San Diego fencing under IIRIRA section \n7 102(b). This intent, in fact, was specified in the bill’s title: “To establish and \n8 rapidly  implement  regulations  for  State  driver’s  license  and  identification \n9 document security standards, to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of \n10 the  United  States,  to  unify  terrorism-related  grounds  for  inadmissibility  and \n11 removal, and to ensure expeditious construction of the San Diego border fence.”  \n12 Although titles “cannot limit the plain meaning of the text,” they are “of use . . \n13 .when they shed light on some ambiguous word or phrase.”  Northstar Financial \n14 Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 615 F.3d 1106, 1120 (9th Cir. 2010).  Here, the \n15 title helps shed light on the scope of the IIRIRA §102(c) waiver.  \n16   In addition, throughout the limited House Floor debate on the REAL ID \n17 Act, the bill’s author and co-sponsors repeatedly made plain their intent that the \n18 expansion  of  the  IIRIRA  §102(c)  waiver  authority  was  specific  to  the  border \n19 barrier segment identified under §102(b)—at that time, the completion of the San \n20 Diego double and  triple layer fence.  An explanation provided by bill sponsors \n21 during  floor  debate  always  “deserves  to  be  accorded  substantial  weight  in \n22 interpreting the statute.”  Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., \n23 426 U.S. 548, 564 (1976).16  In circumstances where legislative consideration is \n24 rushed or truncated, such as the case with the REAL ID Act, courts will give even \n25\n                                                 \n26 16 DHS looks past the clear statements of supporters to instead rely on statements \nmade by opponents of the bill, but “[t]he fears and doubts of the opposition are no \n27\nauthoritative guide to construction of legislation. It is the sponsors that we look to \nwhen the meaning of statutory words is in doubt.”  Schwegmann Bros. v.

Madigan, 954 F.2d 1441, 1453-54 (9th Cir. 1992).       \n4   In his Floor Statement on the legislation, for example, the bill’s author \n5 summarized the bill as including “four of the most important border and document \n6 security provisions” that had been included in a previous House bill, including the \n7 amendment of the §102(c) waiver authority. 151 Cong. Rec. H454 (daily ed., Feb. \n8 9, 2005)(Statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner).17  His description of that amendment \n9 makes  clear  that  it  was  limited  to  completion  of  the  San  Diego  fence  under \n10 §102(b): \n \n11\n[T]he REAL ID Act will waive Federal laws to the extent necessary to \ncomplete gaps in the San Diego border security fence, which is still \n12\nstymied 8 years after congressional authorization.  Neither the public \nsafety nor the environment are benefitting from the current stalemate. \n13\n \n14 Id.  Supporters of the H.R. 418 expansion of the §102(c) waiver authority made \n15 similar statements.   See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. H453-171 (“H.R. 418 provides the \n16 Secretary of Homeland Security with authority to waive environmental laws, so \n17 that the border fence running 14 miles east from the Pacific Ocean at San Diego \n18 may  finally  be  completed.”)  (daily  ed.,  Feb.  9,  2005)  (Statement  of  Rep. \n19 Hoekstra)(emphasis added).  Following inclusion of the bill in the Supplemental \n20 Appropriations Act, the bill’s sponsor issued a press release praising the inclusion \n21 of “his REAL ID Act” legislation, and noting the “closing [of] the 3-Mile Hole in \n22 the  fortified  U.S./Mexico  Border  Fence  Near  San  Diego”  as  one  of  the  bill’s \n23 highlights.  U.S.  Fed  News,  “Rep.  Sensenbrenner  Praises  REAL  ID  Act’s \n24 Inclusion in Supplemental Conference Report.” May 4, 2005.  \n25   DHS  encourages  the  Court  to  disregard  the  sponsor  and  supporter \n26\n                                                 \n27 17 The previous House bill was H.R. 10, which included an amendment that would \nhave waived 16 laws, with the waiver authority limited to completion of the San \n28\nDiego border fence.  H. Amdt. 800. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   24  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.585   Page 36 of 51\n1 statements and instead rely solely on the conference report for the Supplemental \n2 Appropriations Act.  The conference report, however, does not help DHS.  First, \n3 the report’s isolated and general statement that it “provides for construction and \n4 strengthening of barriers along U.S. land borders” is not sufficient to overcome \n5 the repeated and clear statements by the bill’s s author and co-sponsors that the \n6 waiver’s reach was specific to completion of the San Diego triple fence.  Second, \n7 the  conference  report,  in  fact,  emphasizes  that  the  expansion  of  the  waiver \n8 authority was catalyzed by, and intended to address, the delay in completion of the \n9 San  Diego  fence.  H.R.  Rep.  109-72  at  171  (“Despite  the  existing  waiver \n10 provision,  construction  of  the  San  Diego  barriers  has  been  delayed  due  to  a \n11 dispute involving other laws.”).18  \n12   The weight of the legislative history thus reinforces the conclusion that \n13 Congress intended the REAL ID Act’s amendment and expansion of the §102(c) \n14 waiver authority, like the § 102(c) waiver authority as originally enacted in 1996, \n15 to apply only to the specific border barriers required by §102(b).   \n   \n16\nC.  Section  102(c)’s  Requirement  that  Waivers  be  “Necessary  to \nEnsure Expeditious Construction” Demonstrates That Congress \n17\nIntended to Limit the Scope of the §102(c) Waiver to Specific \nBorder Barriers Required Under §102(b)  \n18  \n19    The waiver provision of §102(c) directs that DHS may only waive laws \n20 “necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of barriers and roads.  Although \n21 the term “expeditious construction” is not defined, the logical and straightforward \n22 interpretation is that Congress provided the DHS Secretary with the authority to \n23                                                  \n18 Notably, the report cites the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1541 \n24\net seq., which only applies to a portion of the San Diego border fence, as a law \ncausing delay. Id. (“Continued delays caused by litigation have demonstrated the \n25\nneed for additional waiver authority with respect to other laws that might impede \n26\nthe expeditious construction of security infrastructure along the border, such as the \nCoastal Zone Management Act.”). Obviously, the Coastal Zone Management Act \n27\nis not implicated in any border projects in Arizona, New Mexico, or along 99% of \n28\nTexas’s border. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   25  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.586   Page 37 of 51\n1 waive laws in order to build the specific border barriers (at that time the San \n2 Diego double and triple layer fence) required under § 102(b) as soon as possible \n3 after the law’s enactment.   \n4   DHS nonetheless insists that “the temporal focus of the waiver provision is \n5 on the completion of each construction project under the Act . . . meaning at least \n6 that they can be issued when ‘expeditious construction’ would not occur in the \n7 absence  of  a  waiver.”    DHS  Br.  at  28-29.  By  this  circular  reasoning,  and  as \n8 illustrated by the August 2, 2017 determination, DHS would have the authority, in \n9 perpetuity and untethered to any specific legislative direction from Congress, to \n10 waive laws for any project the agency conjures up that involves the construction \n11 of  border  barriers,  or  even  preparation  for  such  construction.  This  sweeping \n12 authority  would  apply  long  after  the  deadlines  set  by  the  statute  for  the \n13 construction of any such barriers, and in relation to the construction of additional \n14 barriers  that  have  not  been  specifically  directed  by  Congress.  Such  an \n15 unreasonable construction should be rejected. \n16   DHS further disputes the Center’s interpretation by arguing that “nothing in \n17 the text of the Act suggests that Congress intended the waiver authority to sunset.”  \n18 DHS Br. at 28. The same could be said of the converse—there is no evidence in \n19 either  the  text  or  the  legislative  history  that  Congress  intended  the  waiver \n20 authority to persist in perpetuity, or even that Congress ever intended the waiver \n21 authority  to  be  extended  beyond  the  initial  San  Diego  fence.  But  more \n22 importantly, the text of the statute itself does indicate that the waiver authority \n23 was intended to apply only for specific purposes over a specific period of time, \n24 namely until the timely completion of the specific projects mandated by §102(b).  \n25 Those projects have long since been completed. \n26 The current version of §102(b) was last amended by Section 564 of the \n27 2008  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act.  P.L.  110-161,  div.  E.  These \n28 amendments—which remain the law today—include provisions which, when read \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   26  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.587   Page 38 of 51\n1 together with §102(c) do in fact act as a de facto sunset clause on the waiver \n2 authority.  Through these amendments, Congress changed §102(b) to require DHS \n3 to “construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest \n4 border where fencing would be most practical.” §102(b)(1)(A). Then, under the \n5 heading “Priority areas,” §102(b)(1)(B)(i) tasked DHS to “identify the 370 miles, \n6 or other mileage determined by the Secretary,” “where fencing would be most \n7 practical  and  effective.”  Id.  Critically,  this  new  provision  provided  that  the \n8 authority to determine any “other mileage” for priority area fencing “shall expire \n9 on December 31, 2008.” Id. In short, the amendments inserted a sunset clause \n10 explicitly constraining DHS’s authority regarding the determination of “priority \n11 areas”.  Moreover, these amendments also imposed a deadline of December 31, \n12 2008, for the expedited construction of fencing in priority areas. §102(b)(1)(B)(ii). \n13 Following  these  amendments,  DHS  then  invoked  the  §102(c)  waiver  to \n14 meet its mandates under §102(b), and as described supra at Factual Background \n15 I.A., hundreds of miles of barriers were constructed and DHS has stated that it has \n16 now complied with all the requirements of §102(b)(B)(i) & (ii). \n17 If, as DHS now argues, it has unbridled discretion under §102(c) to invoke \n18 a  waiver  at  any  time  to  “expeditiously”  build  projects  pursuant  to  its  general \n19 authority  under  §102(a),  the  explicit  constraint  on  its  authority  imposed  by \n20 Congress  through  the  expiration  of  authority  contained  §102(b)(2)(i)  and  the \n21 construction deadline in §102(b)(2)(ii) would each be rendered a nullity.  Such a \n22 result is impermissible.  See, e.g. Hooks v. Ktsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 \n23 F.3d 550, 560 (9th Cir. 2016) (“It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction \n24 that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, \n25 no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.”).19 \n26\n                                                 \n19 Regardless of whether the mandate of §102(b), and hence the availability of a \n27\nwavier to “expeditiously” construct barriers, is tied to the completion of the 700 \n28\nmiles required by (b)(1) or the December 31, 2008 deadline for the 370 miles of \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   27  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.588   Page 39 of 51\n1 In sum, it is far more reasonable to limit the §102(c) waiver authority to \n2 those barriers that have been specifically mandated by Congress under §102(b) \n3 than to adopt the government’s boundless interpretation.20 \n \n4 D.  Even if the Waiver Authority is Not Limited to Projects Under \n§102(b), the August 2 Waiver is Not Authorized by IIRIRA \n5  \n6 As demonstrated above, the waiver authority in §102(c) must be read as \n7 being  limited  to  those  projects  mandated  by  §102(b).    Because  the  August  2 \n8 waiver purports to cover projects that clearly fall outside of §102(b), it must be \n9 found void by virtue of being ultra vires.  Moreover, even if the Court finds the \n10 waiver authority is not limited to actions under §102(b), the August 2 waiver is \n11 still ultra vires as it is at odds with the requirements of §102(c) itself, as well as \n12 those of §102(a). \n13 First,  a  waiver  under  §102(c)  is  by  its  terms  is  allowed  only  “when \n14 necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads.”  As described \n15 in Section II.C., supra, neither the prototype nor the wall replacement project—\n16 started a decade after the most recent amendments to IIRIRA—can be considered \n17 to require “expeditious” construction.  Second, §102(a) limits barriers to “areas of \n18 high  illegal  entry.”  As  thoroughly  documented  in  the  briefing  of  the  State  of \n19 California,21 by no rational standard can the project area for the prototypes (north \n20 of an existing double fence), nor for the wall replacement itself (already blocked \n21                                                                                                                                                             \npriority  areas  under  (b)(2),  there  can  be  no  reasonable  dispute  that  DHS  has \n22\nfulfilled these obligation under §102(b).  Consequently, the waiver authority under \n§102(c) is no longer available. \n23\n20 Although DHS has fulfilled its statutory duties under §102(b) by constructing \n24\nall of the specific barriers mandated by Congress, Congress could of course again \namend §102(b) to add new specific border barrier requirements, and new time \n25\nconstraints, that could then be subject to the §102(c) waiver authority.  \n26 21 In an effort to reduce redundant briefing, the Center adopts and incorporates by \nreference the State of California’s information and arguments demonstrating that \n27\nthe area subject to the August 2 waiver cannot reasonably be considered an area of \n28\n“high illegal entry.”   \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   28  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.589   Page 40 of 51\n1 by double fence) be considered an area of high illegal entry.  Consequently DHS \n2 lacked the authority to issue the August 2 waiver, and such waiver is ultra vires \n3 and void.  \n4 E.  Because the August 2 Waiver is Ultra Vires, it is Void \n5 As  demonstrated  above,  the  August  2,  2017  waiver  is  ultra  vires  as  it \n6 exceeds the authority delegated by Congress to the DHS Secretary.  Moreover, \n7 because DHS’s broad interpretation of the §102(c) waiver authority raises serious \n8 constitutional questions, while the Center’s interpretation does not, the Court must  \n9 construe  the  statute  so  as  to  avoid  any  such  constitutional  problems.  “[A]s \n10 between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be \n11 unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will \n12 save  the  Act.”  Blodgett  v.  Holden,  275  U.S.  142,  148  (1927);  Edward  J. \n13 DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Const. Trades Council, 485 U.S. \n14 568,  575  (1988)  (“[W]here  an  otherwise  acceptable  construction  of  a  statute \n15 would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to \n16 avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of \n17 Congress”).   \n18 Because, this Court has the authority to set aside the waiver as ultra vires, it \n19 need  never  reach  the  constitutional  infirmaries  of  IIRIRA  §102(c)  itself.  \n20 However, in the event the Court rejects the Center’s ultra vires claim, either on \n21 the  merits  or  because  it  believes  it  lacks  jurisdiction  over  such  a  claim,  as \n22 demonstrated below both the August 2 waiver and the underlying waiver authority \n23 of §102(c) are unconstitutional. \n \n24\nIII.  The August 2 Waiver and the IIRIRA §102(c) Waiver Authority are \n  Unconstitutional \n25  \n26 Both the August 2, 2017 waiver as well as the underlying waiver authority \n27 contained  in  IIRIRA  §102(c)  suffer  from  several,  intertwined  constitutional \n28 defects.  Each of these standing alone is reason to strike down the waiver and/or \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   29  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.590   Page 41 of 51\n1 the statute; collectively they compel such a result. \n \n2\nA.  The August 2 Waiver Violates the Take Care Clause (Article II, \n§3) \n3\n \n4 Article II of the U.S. Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall \n5 be vested in a President,” and that he or she “shall take Care that the Laws be \n6 faithfully executed.” Article II, § 3.  As detailed above, the August 2, 2017 waiver \n7 is  ultra  vires  as  it  exceeds  the  authority  delegated  by  Congress  to  the  DHS \n8 Secretary  in  IIRIRA.  While  the  Center  believes  that  this  Court  clearly  has \n9 jurisdiction to find the waiver ultra vires and set it aside on that basis, DHS argues \n10 that the Court cannot reach such a claim because “all non-constitutional claims are \n11 barred.”  DHS Br. at 11-12.  Even if this were the case, the Take Care Clause of \n12 the  Constitution  provides  a  cause  of  action  under  the  Constitution  that  DHS \n13 cannot possibly argue is precluded by the jurisdictional provision of §102(c). U.S. \n14 Constitution Article II, § 3; cf. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801 \n15 (1992) (“the President’s actions may still be reviewed for constitutionality” even \n16 if APA review is unavailable). \n17 DHS contends that claims under the Take Care Clause are not justiciable, \n18 and in any event can only be brought against the President himself. DHS Br. at \n19 30-33. But ever since Marbury v. Madison, “the courts [have] asserted power to \n20 determine  and  enforce  constitutional  and  other  legal  obligations  of  executive \n21 officials.” 1 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law \n22 § 7.2(a) (2016).  DHS cites Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475, 499 (1867), \n23 which stands only for the proposition that in certain circumstances an injunction \n24 will not lie against the President. But subordinate Executive officers such as the \n25 DHS Secretary are “available as an effective target for specific relief.” Id.; see \n26 also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 582 (1952) (suit \n27 against Secretary of Commerce). \n28 The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the Clause applies to executive \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   30  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.591   Page 42 of 51\n1 officers and other subordinates of the President. Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. \n2 52, 117 (1926) (“But the President alone and unaided could not execute the laws. \n3 He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates. This view has since been \n4 repeatedly affirmed by this court.”); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922 \n5 (1997) (“The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the \n6 laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, ‘shall take Care that the Laws be \n7 faithfully  executed,’  Art.  II,  §  3,  personally  and  through  officers  whom  he \n8 appoints.”). \n9 Moreover, the Supreme Court has long recognized a claim for relief against \n10 federal officials’ unconstitutional acts.  See, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v. Public \n11 Co.  Accounting  Bd.,  561  U.S.  477,  491  n.2  (2010)  (collecting  cases);  United \n12 States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220-21 (1882).  DHS’s position is especially hard to \n13 reconcile with the seminal Youngstown decision.  There, too, the Executive argued \n14 that its actions were unreviewable.  This position was rejected in Youngstown, and \n15 it must be rejected here. The Take Care Clause provides a cause of action under \n16 the Constitution allowing the Center to challenge the August 2 waiver.22 \n17 The August 2 waiver violates the Take Care Clause in two primary ways.  \n18 First,  by  issuing  a  waiver  that  invoked  §102  of  IIRIRA,  but  that  was  not \n19 authorized by IIRIRA, DHS exceeded the authority delegated to the Executive \n20\n                                                 \n22 The Center readily acknowledges that jurisprudence under the Take Care Clause \n21\nis  less  developed  than  under  Presentment  Clause,  Separation  of  Powers  and \n22\nNondelegation Doctrine also at issue in this case.  However, in 2014 the Supreme \nCourt breathed new life into the provision in an order granting certiorari where it \n23\nasked “Whether the Guidance violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, \n24\nArt.  II,  §  3”  United  States  v.  Texas,  136  S.  Ct.  906  (2016)  (order  granting \ncertiorari).  The Court ultimately did not reach the issue.  See also Arizona Dream \n25\nAct Coalition v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 976 (2017) (9th Cir. 2017) (entertaining \n26\nclaim alleging violation of Take Care clause but resolving case on other claim \nbased on constitutional avoidance principle); Jack Goldsmith & John F. Manning, \n27\nThe  Protean  Take  Care  Clause,  164  U.  Pa.  L.  Rev.  1835,  1837  (2016) \n28\n(summarizing cases where the Court found violations of the Take Care Clause). \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   31  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.592   Page 43 of 51\n1 Branch. See supra at section II (describing how the waiver is not authorized under \n2 the  statute  because  the  waiver  authority  is  only  applicable  to  those  barriers \n3 required  under  §102(b)).  Courts  have  long  held  that  the  Take  Care  Clause’s \n4 mandate  to  “faithfully  execute”  the  law  requires  that  the  executive  branch \n5 “execute the laws, not make them,” and therefore precludes actions beyond the \n6 scope of the law at issue. See, e.g., Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 532 (U.S. \n7 2008); Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 587 (“[T]he President’s power to see that the laws \n8 are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.); Myers, 272 \n9 U.S. at 177 (“The duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty \n10 that  does  not  go  beyond  the  laws.”).  Consequently,  for  the  same  reasons  the \n11 August 2 waiver is ultra vires, it is also in violation of the Take Care Clause.  \n12 Article II, § 3. \n13   Additionally, even if the waiver authority under §102(c) is not limited to \n14 those barriers required by §102(b), the August 2 waiver otherwise is at odds with \n15 the specific directive of §102(a) that any barriers built under IIRIRA be in “areas \n16 of high illegal entry,” and hence its issuance runs afoul of the duty to faithfully \n17 execute that statutory mandate.  See supra at section II.A.  \n \n18\nB.  Section 102(c) and the August 2 Waiver Violate the Presentment \nClause (Article I, §7) \n19  \n20   “Familiar historical materials provide abundant support for the conclusion \n21 that the power to enact statutes may only ‘be exercised in accord with a single, \n22 finely  wrought  and  exhaustively  considered,  procedure”  involving  bicameral \n23 passage followed by presentment to the President.  Clinton v. City of New York, \n24 524 U.S. 417, 439-40 (1988) (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983)).  \n25 “Amendment and repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with \n26 Art. I.” Chadha, 462 U.S. at 954.  The power of DHS under §102(c) to pick and \n27 choose which laws to apply—and which to waive application of—has legislative \n28 consequences which must be subject to these Article I requirements.    \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   32  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.593   Page 44 of 51\n1   Section 102(c) is closely analogous to the “cancellation” provisions of the \n2 Line  Item  Veto  Act  struck  down  in  Clinton,  where  the  Court  considered  a \n3 provision  of  that  Act  granting  the  President  authority  to  “cancel”  certain \n4 appropriations  that  had  been  passed  by  Congress,  after  he  had  signed  bills \n5 containing those appropriations into law.  The Court struck down the law because \n6 “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, \n7 to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Id. at 439.  Like the Line Item Veto Act, §102(c) \n8 authorizes  an  executive  branch  official  to  legislate,  by  partial  repeal  or \n9 amendment,  without  observing  the  requirements  of  bicameralism  and \n10 presentment.  \n11   As DHS notes, the only decision to analyze a presentment clause claim \n12 challenge to §102(c) found the provision constitutional because “the Secretary has \n13 no authority to alter the text of any statute, repeal any law, or cancel any statutory \n14 provision.” Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 124 (D.D.C. \n15 2017); DHS Br. at 37. The Supreme Court’s decision in Clinton, however, did not \n16 turn  on  whether  or  not  the  cancelled  provisions  remained  in  the  U.S.  Code.  \n17 Instead,  the  Court  focused  on  the  “legal  and  practical”  effects  of  the  veto \n18 authority.  Like that authority, the §102(c) waiver provision results in legal and \n19 practical  effects  that  must  be  considered  partial  repeal  or  amendment  of  the \n20 waived statutes without observance to required constitutional procedures.  \n21   The court’s decision in Defenders was further flawed in its reliance on the \n22 canard that “by [plaintiff’s] logic, any waiver, not matter how limited in scope, \n23 would Violate I.”  Defenders of Wildlife, 527 F.2d at 124 (emphasis in original).  \n24 The §102(c) authority is not just any waiver.  As noted by one commenter, a \n25 “broad reading of the Presentment Clause and the holding in Clinton would call \n26 into question [IIRIRA §102(c)].  This is not to say, however, that every waiver of \n27 law by a member of the executive branch is unconstitutional.”  Kate R.

This is \n2 because “the scope of the [IIRIRA §102(c)] provision is quite different” from \n3 previous laws considered in Presentment Clause challenges, because it “functions \n4 as a freestanding authority to waive any legal requirement,” its “focus is broader,” \n5 and “it limits judicial review.”  Id. at 291.  \n6   Even if the Court finds Defenders persuasive, DHS’s August 2 invocation \n7 of the §102(c) authority shows that its reach is far broader in scope than presumed \n8 by the court in that case.  Instead of being limited to border barriers which were \n9 specifically mandated by Congress pursuant to §102(b), DHS is purporting to \n10 expand that authority to the border wall prototype and border fence replacement \n11 project under the claimed “general mandate in §102(a) that is not geographically \n12 limited.”  DHS Br. at 21 (emphasis added).   \n13   Notwithstanding this aggressive claim of authority, DHS states that “[t]he \n14 statutes retain their general legal force and effect because the Secretary’s waiver \n15 extends to only a tiny fraction of the universe of cases to which NEPA and similar \n16 statutes apply.” DHS Br. at 37.  DHS’s concept of a “tiny fraction of the universe” \n17 encompasses  a  significant  expanse  of  U.S.  soil.  In  total,  the  seven  §102(c) \n18 determinations  issued  to  date  have  waived  more  than  35  laws  on  nearly  650 \n19 miles—approximately one third of the 2,000 mile long southern border. These \n20 waivers have already cut a large hole in the fabric of protections provided by \n21 NEPA, the ESA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other waived laws.  \n22 Accordingly, the August 2 waiver cannot be considered anything other than an \n23 unconstitutional partial repeal or amendment of the waived laws.23  \n24                                                  \n23 Moreover, the August 2 determination targets laws with limited geographic \n25 reach, most notably the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106-145.  \nUnder that Act, Congress protected 16,885 acres of federal land administered by \n26 the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), within the U.S. Department of the \nInterior. This area protects unique and rare ecosystems, including populations of \n27\nthe endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly and Mexican flannel bush, and the \nonly  known  stand  of  Tecate  cypress  in  the  United  States.  By  waiving  the \n28\nrequirements of the wilderness acts, DHS is facilitating the construction of border \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   34  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.595   Page 46 of 51\n     \n1\n  C.  Section 102(c), as Demonstrated by the August 2 Waiver, Violates \n    the Nondelegation Doctrine \n2\n \n3   The  nondelegation  doctrine  is  “rooted  in  the  principle  of  separation  of \n4 powers that underlies our tripartite system of Government.”  Mistretta v. United \n5 States,  488  U.S.  361,  371  (1989).  It  provides  “that  Congress  may  not \n6 constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government.”  \n7 Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991).  To abide by this limitation, \n8 Congress must “lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the \n9 person  or  body  authorized  [to  act]  is  directed  to  conform.”    Whitman  v.  Am. \n10 Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001).  The intelligible principle standard \n11 consists of a three prong test: whether Congress has “clearly delineate[d] (1) the \n12 general policy, (2) the public agency which is to apply it, and (3) the boundaries \n13 of the delegated authority.”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372-73.     \n14   Here, the §102(c) waiver authority plainly fails to meet the third factor, as \n15 illustrated by the August 2 determination.  Although the prior district courts to \n16 consider nondelegation challenges to §102(c) have rejected them, those decisions \n17 were all premised on the understanding that the scope of the waiver authority was \n18 constrained to completion of specific border barriers mandated by Congress.  See \n19 Sierra  Club,  2005  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  44244,  at  *21  (boundary  of  delegated \n20 authority is waiver of laws “solely in the context of this Triple Fence”); Defenders \n21 of Wildlife, 527 F.2d at 128; Save Our Heritage v. Gonzales, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58, \n22 63 (D.D.C. 2008); County of El Paso, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83045 (W.D. Tex. \n23 Aug. 29, 2008), at *12.     \n24\n                                                                                                                                                            \nbarriers, roads, and other infrastructure that will have real, permanent, and far \n25\nreaching impacts, and directly destroy the “wilderness quality” of much of this \n26 relatively  small  expanse  of  protected  land.  Although  the  Otay  Mountain \nWilderness Act is still a part of the United States Code, the §102(c) waiver has \n27 greatly diminished its intended purpose and protections, and thus constitutes a \nrepeal of that law without observance of the Presentment Clause requirements.  \n28\n \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   35  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.596   Page 47 of 51\n1   In contrast, the August 2, 2017 determination was made several years after \n2 DHS  has  fulfilled  its  border  barrier  mandates  under  IIRIRA,  and  without  the \n3 enactment of any new or additional statutory fence-building mandates. And unlike \n4 past  waivers  considered  in  Sierra  Club,  Defenders,  Save  Our  Heritage,  and \n5 County of El Paso, which focused solely on building new fencing specifically \n6 mandated by Congress pursuant to §102(b), the August 2 determination applies to \n7 “various” border projects along a fifteen mile region, including the border wall \n8 prototype and border fence replacement.   \n9   DHS’s  interpretation  of  actions  subject  to  §102(c)  has  no  meaningful \n10 boundaries.  According  to  DHS,  IIRIRA  “makes  clear  that  the  Secretary’s \n11 authority encompasses more than the ‘physical barriers and roads’ themselves,” \n12 and includes projects that “concern” barrier construction, as well as those that “the \n13 Secretary deem[s] necessary to prepare for future installation[s].”  DHS Br. at 23-\n14 24  (emphasis  added).    The  scope  of  actions  falling  under  these  umbrellas  of \n15 generality  and  vagueness  would  extend  well  beyond  the  prototypes  and \n16 replacement wall.  If DHS’s interpretation is true—a contention that the Center \n17 strongly disputes—then the boundaries of the delegated authority under §102(c) \n18 are far larger and more amorphous than assumed by any of the previous courts \n19 considering nondelegation challenges.  \n20   By attempting to expand the waiver authority beyond specifically mandated \n21 border fencing projects to a larger universe of border security projects such as the \n22 prototype and replacement project, DHS also undermines the inherent temporal \n23 and  geographic  limitations  on  that  authority.  Instead  of  the  “expeditious \n24 construction”  constraint  of  §102(c)  directing  DHS  to  build  mandated  border \n25 barriers  as  quickly  as  possible  following  specific  Congressional  direction,  the \n26 government asserts that “the temporal focus of the waiver provision is on the \n27 completion  of  each  construction  project  under  the  Act.”  DHS  Br.  at  28. \n28 Conveniently, this reading permits DHS to treat every border infrastructure project \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   36  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.597   Page 48 of 51\n1 it proposes under IIRIRA as within the waiver authority, in perpetuity and in the \n2 absence  of  specific  Congressional  mandates  or  authorization.    This  limitless \n3 discretion  is  especially  problematic  in  light  of  the  broad  scope  of  authority \n4 delegated  to  the  DHS  Secretary  under  §102(c)  to waive  any  law,  based  on  a \n5 necessity  determination,  Whitman,  531  U.S.  at  475  (“the  degree  of  agency \n6 discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of power congressional \n7 conferred.”), as well as its limitations on judicial review.  Touby, 500 U.S. at 170 \n8 (Marshall,  J.  concurring)  (“[J]udicial  review  perfects  a  delegated-lawmaking \n9 scheme  by  assuring  that  the  exercise  of  such  power  remains  within  statutory \n10 bounds.”).  \n11    Because the §102(c) waiver authority delegates sweeping authority to the \n12 DHS  Secretary  without  establishing  a  clearly  delineated  boundary  to  that \n13 delegation—as illustrated by the August 2, 2017 determination—the provision is \n14 an  unconstitutional  delegation  of  legislative  authority  to  an  executive  branch \n15 official and must be struck down.24  \n16 IV.  Plaintiff Has Standing \n17   The  Center  and  its members  have  standing  in  this  case  pursuant  to the \n18 familiar  three-part  test:  (1)  its  members  have  suffered,  and  will  continued  to \n19 suffer, “injury in fact” that is concrete and particularized, and the threat must be \n20\n                                                 \n24 Nor can DHS fall back on its assertion that Congress may delegate in even \n21\nbroader  terms  than  normal  under  Loving  v.  United  States,  517  U.S.  748,  772 \n22\n(1996)  (delegations  may  be  broader  than  “where  the  entity  exercising  the \ndelegated authority possesses independent authority over the subject matter.”).  \n23\nLoving,  however,  addressed  an  “internal  waiver”  pertaining  to  the  agency’s \n24\nexpertise.  Section 102(c), in contrast, is unprecedented in that it allows DHS \nbroad authority to waive any external law, the vast majority of which have nothing \n25\nto do with its subject matter. See Bowers, 34 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 257 at 263 \n26\n(discussing typology of waivers).  As shown by each of the waivers issued to date, \nDHS has targeted environmental, cultural, and historic protection laws, as well as \n27\nlaws pertaining to religious freedom, Native American gravesites, and farmland \n28\nprotection—none of which are remotely related to DHS’s authority and expertise.   \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   37  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.598   Page 49 of 51\n1 actual  and  imminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical;  (2)  the  alleged  harm  is \n2 traceable  to  defendants’  failure  to  comply  with  NEPA  and  the  ESA,  and  its \n3 purported waiver of those laws pursuant to §102(c); and (3) a favorable judicial \n4 decision that invalidates the waiver and directs compliance with NEPA and the \n5 ESA will prevent or redress the injury.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \n6 Envt’l Services, Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-181 (2000).    \n7   The  Center’s  affidavits  in  this  case  show  recreational,  professional, \n8 aesthetic,  and  personal  interests,  for  the  Center  organizationally,  and  for  its \n9 members  specifically,  in  the  protection  and  conservation  of  particular  species \n10 within a particular place (the fifteen mile project area, including the border wall \n11 prototype and border fence replacement projects) which have been and continue to \n12 be harmed by defendants’ waiver of laws.  Ecological Rights Found. v. Pacific \n13 Lumber Co., 230 F.3d 1141, 1147 (9th Cir. 2000) (injury in fact shown through \n14 affidavits showing “an aesthetic or recreational interest in a particular place, or \n15 animal,  or  plant  species  and  that  that  interest  is  impaired  by  defendant’s \n16 conduct.”).  See, e.g., Declaration of Jill M. Holslin, at ¶ 6 (describing interest in \n17 and  observation  of  rare  species  including  Quino  checkerspot  butterfly,  Tecate \n18 cypress,  and  snowy  plovers);  Declaration  of  Christopher  D.  Nagano,  at  ¶  8 \n19 (describing  interest  in  numerous  imperiled  species,  including  San  Diego  and \n20 Riverside fairy shrimp, Quino checkerspot butterfly, Otay Mesa mint, and Otay \n21 tarplant);  Declaration  of  Peter  Galvin,  at  ¶  16  (describing  interest  in  Quino \n22 checkerspot  butterfly  and  other  species).  The  affidavits  further  demonstrate \n23 repeated and extensive visitation to the project area, and specific plans to return to \n24 those areas. See, e.g., Holslin Decl., at ¶¶ 7-8;  Nagano Decl., at ¶¶ 10, 16-17, 30. \n25 These interests are more than sufficient to confer standing. \n26   DHS’s  failure  to  comply  with  NEPA  and  the  ESA,  as  well  as  its \n27 inapplicable  and  unconstitutional  waiver  of  those  laws  under  the  August  2 \n28 determination, are clearly the cause of the Center’s and its members’ injuries.  An \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   38  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.599   Page 50 of 51\n1 order from this Court invalidating the August 2 waiver, and ordering DHS to \n2 comply with NEPA, the ESA, and all applicable law would remedy that harm.  \n3 Accordingly, the Center has established standing.  \n \n4 V.  Judgment Should be Entered for the Center on the NEPA and ESA \n  Claims \n5  \n6   Because  the  August  2  waiver  is  ultra  vires  to  IIRIRA  §102(c)  and  is \n7 unconstitutional,  DHS’s  waiver  of  NEPA,  the  ESA,  and  the  APA,  is  invalid.  \n8 Accordingly,  DHS  may  only  proceed  with  the  border  wall  prototype  and \n9 replacement projects after compliance with those and all other applicable laws, \n10 and judgment should be issued for plaintiff on Claim IV (NEPA violations—\n11 failure to prepare NEPA analysis) and Claim V (ESA violations-- §7(a)(1) and \n12 §7(a)(2)).  \n13   DHS’s argument that the Center failed to provide the requisite notice prior \n14 to bringing its ESA claims should be rejected.  The ESA requires written notice of \n15 certain violations of the Act to be provided at least sixty days prior to bringing \n16 suit, and plaintiff has met these notice requirements here through notice letters \n17 pertaining  specifically  to  the  border  wall  prototype  project  and  border  wall \n18 replacement project on June 1, 2017, and July 7, 2017, respectively. 16 U.S.C. \n19 §1540(g)(2)(A)(i). DHS did not remedy the alleged violations, and the Center \n20 added those ESA claims to its second amendment complaint filed September 6, \n21 2017 (ECF No. 16), more than sixty days after the notice was provided.  \n22   DHS claims that the Center “prematurely” sent its notice letters, because \n23 the letters “preceded the award of contracts for the challenged projects and the \n24 commencement of construction.”  DHS Br. at 39.  Nothing in the ESA prevents a \n25 notice from being valid as to a future action—the analysis instead turns on the \n26 notice’s “overall sufficiency.”  Klamath-Siskiyou Midlands Ctr. v. MacWhorter, \n27 797 F.3d 645, 651 (9th Cir. 2015); Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, 83 F.3d 1068, \n28 1073 (9th Cir. 1996) (notice is adequate if it provides defendants with notice of \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   39  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17- cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 28-1   Filed 11/22/17   PageID.600   Page 51 of 51\n1 issues plaintiff intends to pursue in litigation, so that alleged violations may be \n2 corrected); Colo. Envtl. Coal. v. Office of Legacy Mgmt., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1193, \n3 1219 (D. Colo. 2011)(“nothing in the notice statute’s language explicitly prevents \n4 a notice from being effective as to a future action.”).  \n5   Here, the Center’s notice letters clearly served their purpose of putting DHS \n6 on  notice  of  ESA  violations  for  the  border  wall  prototype  and  replacement \n7 projects, regardless of whether that notice was provided before contracts have \n8 been issued.  Indeed, it is ironic that DHS attempts to fault the sufficiency of the \n9 Center’s notice given that the lack of information available to the Center and the \n10 public generally is due to DHS’s decision to waive laws such as the ESA and \n11 NEPA. Because the Center’s ESA notice letters were more than sufficient to put \n12 DHS on notice of the alleged violations, DHS’s argument should be rejected.   \n13 CONCLUSION \n14   For the foregoing reasons, the Center respectfully requests the Court to \n15 grant its motion for summary judgment on its Claims I-VI. \n16  \n17 DATED: November 22, 2017    Respectfully submitted,  \n18  \ns/ Brian Segee \n19\nBrian Segee  \n20\nBrendan Cummings  \n21 Anchun Jean Su  \nJohn Peter Rose  \n22\n \n23\nAttorneys for Plaintiff \n24\n \n25\n26\n27\n28\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities   40  17cv01215 ",

Although several district courts have rejected constitutional challenges \n11 to  past  uses  of  the  §  102(c)  waiver  authority,  the  DHS  Secretary’s  August  2 \n12 invocation of § 102(c) was done more than a decade after the provision’s last use, \n13 and comes long after the agency fulfilled its border fence obligations under § \n14 102(b).  As the August 2 waiver and DHS’s briefing makes clear, the current \n15 administration is now attempting to transform § 102(c)—an unwise and dangerous \n16 abdication of lawmaking authority to the executive branch to begin with—into a \n17 perpetual and roving license to cast aside any legal obligations pertaining to any \n18 border infrastructure project.   \n19   This  unbounded  interpretation  is  without  merit,  and  the  Trump \n20 administration’s attempt to revive the § 102(c) waiver authority must be rejected \n21 as ultra vires and unconstitutional.  As detailed in the Center’s opening brief and \n22 this reply brief, the language, structure, and legislative history of IIRIRA and its \n23 amendments demonstrate that the scope of the § 102(c) authority must be limited \n24 to specific border barriers required by Congress pursuant to § 102(b), which does \n25 not include the border wall prototype or replacement projects.  Alternatively, if the \n26 Court finds that the August 2 waiver was not ultra vires, the waiver inescapably  \n27 violates the U.S. Constitution’s fundamental separation of powers principles, and \n28 thus, the Center’s summary judgment motion should be granted.  \nCBD Reply Brief  1  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1246   Page 8 of 27\n1 ARGUMENT \n \n2 I.  The Court Has Jurisdiction to Determine Whether the August 2 \n  Waiver Was Properly Within the Scope of § 102(c)(1) \n3  \n4   As detailed in the Center’s opening brief (ECF No. 28-1), DHS cannot hide \n5 behind the judicial review restrictions of § 102(c)(2) in order to escape review of \n6 whether the August 2 waiver was in fact properly within the scope of § 102(c)(1) \n7 to begin with.  Much of DHS’s opposition/reply brief largely rehashes arguments \n8 from its opening brief, including lengthy discussions of undisputed issues. The \n9 Center, for example, does not dispute that “Congress plainly intended to bar all \n10 judicial  review  of  non-constitutional  claims,”  DHS  Br.  at  11-14,  that  “[t]he \n11 legislative  history  and  statutory  context  support  the  plain  meaning  of  the \n12 jurisdictional bar,” DHS Br. at 14-16, or that Congress intended to overcome the \n13 presumption favoring judicial review, DHS Br. at 11, but only for those actions \n14 properly within the scope of the § 102(c) waiver.  As again detailed in section II \n15 below, the August 2 waiver is not authorized by § 102(b) and therefore is not a \n16 decision made “pursuant to” IIRIRA § 102(c)(1).  Accordingly, the August 2 \n17 waiver is ultra vires and subject to review by this court, and the § 102(c)(2) \n18 judicial review restrictions are simply inapplicable.  \n19   DHS  continues  to  incorrectly  assert  that  the  Center’s  arguments  run \n20 “against  the  plain  reading  of  the  statutory  language,”  and  that  the  Center \n21 “identifies no support” for its’ allegedly “aggressive interpretation” of § 102(c).  \n22 DHS Br. at 19.  To the contrary, the Center’s interpretation is a plain language \n23 argument, and is necessary to define the scope of the waiver authority.  Without \n24 this inquiry, it would be impossible to abide by Ninth Circuit precedent holding \n25 that,  “in  interpreting  IIRIRA,  ‘we  should  construe  narrowly  restrictions  on \n26 jurisdiction.’”  Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683 (9th Cir. \n27 2003); see also El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. United States, 632 F.3d 1272, 1276 \n28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (where statute expressly prohibits judicial review, presumption of \nCBD Reply Brief  2  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1247   Page 9 of 27\n1 judicial review “dictates that such provisions must be read narrowly.”).1  Under \n2 that  plain  language,  the  waiver  authority  under  §  102(c)(2)  only  applies  to \n3 decisions made by the DHS Secretary “pursuant to” § 102(c)(1), which in turn \n4 limits the waiver authority to the expeditious construction “of the barriers and \n5 roads under this section.”  The Center’s opening brief demonstrated in detail that \n6 the scope of this provision must be interpreted as limited to the specific projects \n7 mandated by Congress in § 102(b).   \n8   DHS’s argument that the court cannot consider this ultra vires argument is \n9 also undermined by the primary cases it relies upon.  In Spencer Enterprises, for \n10 example, the Ninth Circuit considered a preclusive provision under IIRIRA, 8 \n11 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), that is, in the government’s words, “strikingly similar” \n12 to § 102(c).  DHS Br. at 12.  Far from cutting against plaintiffs, however, the court \n13 specifically held that “[e]ven if a statute gives the Attorney General discretion … \n14 the courts retain jurisdiction to review whether a particular decision is ultra vires \n15 the  statute  in  question,”  345  F.3d  at  689,  precisely  the  claim  the  Center  has \n16 brought in this case. \n17   Although DHS attempts to distinguish Spencer Enterprises by claiming that \n18 “here, nothing in the text demonstrates an intent to narrow the jurisdiction-limiting \n19 provision,” DHS Br. at 20, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is in fact even more preclusive than \n20 § 102(c), stating that “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” the specified \n21 decisions  by  the  Attorney  General.    Just  as  the  court  in  Spencer  Enterprises \n22 looked beyond the preclusive language in order to determine the scope of that \n23 provision, an ultra vires inquiry to determine whether the August 2 waiver was  \n24 within the scope of § 102(c) is proper here.  \n25   DHS also reiterates its argument that the Center “cannot evade Congress’ \n26 clear  jurisdictional  limitation”  by  alleging  an  ultra  vires  claim,  again  heavily \n27\n                                                 \n28 1 Unless indicated otherwise, case law citations omit internal citations. \nCBD Reply Brief  3  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1248   Page 10 of 27\n1 relying  on  Leedom  v.  Kyne,  358  U.S.  184  (1958),2  and  the  Supreme  Court’s \n2 subsequent consideration of that decision in Bd. of Governors of Fed. Res. Sys. v. \n3 MCorp Fin. Inc., 502 U.S. 33 (1991).3  DHS Br. at 17-18.  MCorp, however, is of \n4 no help to DHS, and bears little resemblance to the Center’s ultra vires claim.   \n5   In that case, the Court reviewed the validity of an injunction requiring the \n6 Federal Reserve Board to halt an enforcement action it had instituted against a \n7 bank under the Federal Reserve Act.  Although plaintiff MCorp’s action was not \n8 authorized under that law, the Court of Appeals invoked Kyne for the principle \n9 that the district court has jurisdiction because plaintiff alleged that the Board was \n10 enforcing a regulation that exceeded its statutory authority.  502 U.S. at 42-43.  \n11 The  Supreme  Court  reversed  and  found  that  an  ultra  vires  claim  was  not \n12 authorized.  Contrary to DHS’s claims that “Congressional intent to prohibit ultra \n13 vires review is at least as clear here as it was in MCorp,” the Court’s rejection of \n14 an  ultra  vires  claim  in  that  case  was  premised  instead  on  the  availability  of \n15 judicial review under a separate statute, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act \n16 of 1966 (“FISA”): \n \n17\nThe cases before us today are entirely different from Kyne because FISA \nexpressly provides MCorp with a meaningful and adequate opportunity for \n18\njudicial review of the validity of the source of strength regulation.  If and \nwhen the Board finds that MCorp has violated that regulation, MCorp will \n19\nhave, in the Court of Appeals, an unquestioned right to review of both the \n20 regulation and its application. \n21\n                                                 \n2 Contrary to DHS’s characterization, DHS Br. at 17-18, Kyne is not “the seminal \n22\nultra  vires  decision.”  The  ability  to  bring  such  an  ultra  vires  claim  was  first \nrecognized by the Supreme Court decades earlier in American School of Magnetic \n23\nHealing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902). \n24  \n3 As stated in the Center’s opening brief, it is not primarily relying on “Kyne and \n25 its progeny,” DHS Br. at 18, involving inferred preclusion, but Dart v. United \nStates,  848  F.2d  217  (D.C.  Cir.  1988)  and  related  cases  addressing  explicit \n26 preclusion provisions similar to § 102.  See McBryde v. Comm. to Review Circuit \nCouncil Conduct & Disability Orders of the Judicial Conf. of the United States, \n27\n264 F.3d 52, 63 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (addressing two claims, one brought pursuant to \nKyne and one brought pursuant to Dart).  The Center’s right to ultra vires review \n28\nof the DHS August 2 waiver, however, exists under either line of cases. \nCBD Reply Brief  4  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1249   Page 11 of 27\n1 Id.  at  43-44.    Although  the  Court  also  noted  the  “clarity  of  congressional \n2 preclusion of review in FISA,” as a secondary rationale, it described that factor as \n3 inextricably “related” and bound up with the dominant reasoning underlying its \n4 decision,  the  availability  of  review  through  administrative  proceedings  that \n5 plaintiff sought to bypass.  Id. (“As we have explained, however, in this case the \n6 statute provides us with clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to \n7 deny the District Court jurisdiction to review and enjoin the Board’s ongoing \n8 administrative  proceedings.”)  (emphasis  added).      In  contrast,  there  are  no \n9 alternative  avenues  of  judicial  or  administrative  review  available  here  to \n10 determine whether the August 2 waiver is ultra vires to the scope of authority \n11 delegated to the DHS Secretary pursuant to IIRIRA § 102. \n12   In  sum,  MCorp  was  a  timing  case,  distinct  from  the  ultra  vires \n13 considerations here, where plaintiffs have no avenues of judicial or administrative \n14 review  by  which  to  challenge  the  August  2  waiver  as  outside  the  scope  of \n15 authority provided  to  the  DHS  Secretary  pursuant  to § 102(c).   Although  the \n16 appellate court framed its decision as ultra vires in MCorp, the Supreme Court’s \n17 holding  was  in  fact  a  rejection  of  plaintiff’s  attempt  to  avoid  exhausting  the \n18 extensive administrative and judicial remedies available to it.  See MCorp Fin., \n19 Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Res. Sys., 900 F.2d 852, 859 (5th Cir. 1990) \n20 (“Because we conclude that MCorp is not required to exhaust its administrative \n21 remedies in this circumstance, we turn to the merits of whether the Board has \n22 authority to [take the challenged action.]”).4   \n23     Recognizing the limited significance of the Court’s ultra vires discussion \n24                                                  \n4 Indeed, contrary to DHS’s claim that “just as in MCorp Financial, Congress has \n25 spoken clearly and directly to preclude all judicial review,” DHS Br. at 18, the \nFISA provisions considered in MCorp are not preclusive at all when read as a \n26 whole.  Although 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1) limits jurisdiction “except as provided in \nthis section,” the preceding subparagraph, id. § 1818(h)(1)-(2) (“Hearings and \n27\njudicial review”) provides aggrieved parties with extensive and specific rights to \nboth administrative and judicial review.  These provisions starkly contrast with the \n28\nutter lack of procedure or review available under IIRIRA § 102.   \nCBD Reply Brief  5  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1250   Page 12 of 27\n1 in MCorp, the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1044 n.8 \n2 (9th Cir. 1992), specifically rejected the same type of expansive interpretation of \n3 that case urged by DHS here. (“The government suggested at oral argument that \n4 [MCorp] means that claims that an agency acted outside the scope of its delegated \n5 authority are not reviewable if the statute precludes judicial review.  We do not \n6 believe  that  MCorp  precludes  judicial  review  of  this  type  of  claim  under  the \n7 [Export Authorization Act] EAA.”).  DHS weakly attempts to limit the language \n8 of  Bozarov,  incorrectly  asserting  that  the  Ninth  Circuit  “expressly  limited  its \n9 holding” to that law, DHS Br. at 21.  To the contrary, the court’s language broadly \n10 distinguished MCorp not only in relation to the EAA, but any other statute that \n11 provides no other avenue of judicial review (such as § 102(c)): \n \n12 The  Court  [in  MCorp]  emphasized  that  preclusion  of  review  was \nacceptable in part because the petitioner had a meaningful and adequate \n13\nopportunity  for  judicial  review  of  the  regulation  that  he  argued  was \npromulgated  in  excess  of  the  agency’s  statutory  authority.    The  EAA \n14\npresents  an  entirely  different  situation;  petitioners  have  no  other \nopportunity  to  challenge  regulations  or  their  applications.  We  therefore \n15\nbelieve that Dart still sets out the correct standard to be applied to the \n16 EAA.  \n \n17\nId.  Accordingly, the Bozarov court did indeed “narrowly cabin[] MCorp” in the \n18\nNinth Circuit.  DHS Br. at 20.  In addition, the Ninth Circuit has in the past month \n19\naffirmed the availability of ultra vires review, stating that “[t]his cause of action, \n20\nwhich exists outside the APA, allows courts to review ultra vires actions by the \n21\nPresident  that  go  beyond  the  scope  of  the  President’s  statutory  authority.”  \n22\nHawai’i v. Trump, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 26513, *35-36 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017) \n23\n(citing McAnnulty, 187 U.S. at 108, 110, and Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188-189).  \n24\n  Finally, DHS argues that the Center “cannot make expansive use of Dart” \n25\nbecause that case “stands for the exceedingly narrow proposition that a statute \n26\nprecluding review is limited by its language.”  DHS Br. at 22 (quoting McBryde, \n27\n264 F.3d at 63).  However, as detailed in the Center’s opening brief and Section \n28\nCBD Reply Brief  6  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1251   Page 13 of 27\n1 II, supra, the Center’s ultra vires argument is in fact rooted in the language of § \n2 102(c), and is closely analogous to the factual circumstances in Dart.  As stated in \n3 that  case,  “Dart’s  claim  of  agency  error  rests  on  an  assertion about  the  plain \n4 requirements of the EAA: that the statutory authority to ‘modify’ an ALJ decision \n5 regarding export sanctions does not include the power to reverse that decision.”  \n6 Dart, 848 F.2d at 222.  Similarly here, the Center’s claim of agency error rests on \n7 an assertion about the plain requirements of IIRIRA § 102: that the statutory \n8 authority to waive laws under § 102(c) does not include the border wall prototype \n9 or  replacement  projects,  because  neither  of  those  projects  was  specifically \n10 mandated by Congress pursuant to § 102(b).   \n11   DHS further attempts to distinguish Dart on the grounds that “the EAA’s \n12 language is quite dissimilar from the language at issue here.”  DHS Br. at 22.  \n13 Indeed,  the  EAA  and  statutory  provisions  at  issue  in  other  cases  are  more \n14 preclusive than § 102, and as the government concedes, these finality provisions \n15 “have often been found to reflect an intent to preclude merits review but not ultra \n16 vires review,” DHS Br. at 22.   As explained in Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607, 624 \n17 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (quoted in Dart, 848 F.2d at 222) (emphasis added): \n \n18 In neither [line of cases] … was the demarcation of reviewability set by the \nCourt [i.e. between ‘facial’ and other statutory violations] adumbrated by \n19\nCongress.  Rather, Congress had expressed an unqualified intent to shut \noff review, to which exception was made on ground that the legislature \n20\nwould not be deemed to have barred judicial comparison of agency action \nwith plain statutory commands unless such a ban was clearly articulated. \n21  \n22 Although DHS insists that Congress “has employed far more unambiguous and \n23 comprehensive language” here, that simply is not the case.  As detailed in Dart, \n24 numerous courts have permitted ultra vires review under statutes with far more \n25 unambiguous and unqualified finality provisions than § 102(c), yet those courts \n26 found such preclusion clauses to be “less than absolute.”  Dart, 848 F.2d at 221.  \n27 The fact that Congress chose to provide for limited constitutional review under § \n28 102 does not in any way translate to the requisite “absolute” intent to bar ultra \nCBD Reply Brief  7  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1252   Page 14 of 27\n1 vires review.  See DHS Br. at 16 (“Standing alone, this express provision for \n2 constitutional review but no other review indicates that ultra vires review was \n3 intentionally excluded.”).  Because Congress did not express any specific intent to \n4 bar ultra vires review, let alone an “unqualified intent,” the Center’s claim is not \n5 precluded. \n \n6 II.  The Scope of the § 102(c) Waiver is Limited to the Specific Border \n  Barriers Required Under § 102(b) \n7  \n8   The  Center’s  opening  brief  demonstrates  that  IIRIRA  §  102’s  purpose, \n9 statutory language and structure, and legislative history all dictate that the scope \n10 of § 102(c) is limited to specific border barrier projects mandated under § 102(b).  \n11 See  Hawai’i  v.  Trump,  2017  U.S.  App.  LEXIS  26516,  *37-47  (engaging  in \n12 analysis  of  statutory  text,  statutory  framework,  and  legislative  history  in \n13 concluding  President  had  exceeded  constitutionally  delegated  authority).    In \n14 accordance  with  the  presumption  favoring  judicial  review—and  of  narrowly \n15 interpreting exceptions to such review—the court in Dart placed the burden on the \n16 government to show “‘clear and convincing evidence’ that Congress foreclosed \n17 [its] jurisdiction over Dart’s claim.”  Dart, 848 F.3d at 224.  DHS, in contrast, \n18 insists under the Kyne line of cases that the Center carries the burden of showing \n19 that the challenged action contravenes “‘clear and mandatory’ statutory language.”  \n20 Pacific  Maritime  Association  v.  NLRB,  827  F.3d  1203,  1208  (9th  Cir.  2016) \n21 (quoting Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188).5  While the Center believes that the Dart test \n22 governs here, the August 2 waiver is ultra vires regardless of which party bears \n23 the burden, and under even the most stringent of statutory tests.  \n24\n                                                 \n25 5 In Pacific Maritime Association, the court concluded “it appears likely that [the \ndecision at issue] violated the ‘clear and mandatory’ language of the Act.”  827 \n26 F.3d at 1209-1210.  It declined to exercise ultra vires jurisdiction, however, after \nfinding that plaintiffs had two alternative paths of judicial review available to \n27\nthem.  Id. at 1210 (“Nonetheless, because we conclude that the district court’s \nexercise of jurisdiction was improper under [Kyne’s] second prong, we leave it to \n28\nthe Board to render a final decision on its own jurisdiction in the first instance.”).  \nCBD Reply Brief  8  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1253   Page 15 of 27\n1   DHS goes to great lengths to argue against the Center’s “narrow reading,” \n2 DHS Br. at 28, asserting that “the better reading is that § 102(a) remains available \n3 to address locations not prioritized by Congress.”  DHS Br. at 32-33.  Notably, \n4 however,  DHS  never  squarely  acknowledges  the  ramifications  of  its proposed \n5 interpretation: that the DHS Secretary would be granted perpetual authority to \n6 waive any laws she deems to interfere with any border infrastructure project, even \n7 where  such  projects  have  not  been  mandated  by  Congress.    This  pugnacious \n8 assertion of unchecked executive power is based on an implausible interpretation \n9 of § 102(c), as well as § 102 as a whole, and must be rejected.  \n10   DHS’s errors begin with its insistence that the “plain terms” of the phrase \n11 “this section” under § 102(c) “unambiguously refers to IIRIRA § 102 as a whole,” \n12 DHS Br. at 27, and that § 102 “as a whole” contains an essentially unlimited grant \n13 of authority under § 102(a) to build border barriers anytime and anywhere.   As \n14 detailed in the Center’s opening brief, this argument is flawed for at least three \n15 reasons: 1) in the only judicial decision to address the scope of the § 102(c) \n16 waiver  authority, the court repeatedly and emphatically held that the scope is \n17 limited to the specific projects identified under § 102(b), Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, \n18 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005); 2) the text of § 102 \n19 shows  that  Congress  provided  the  necessary  authorizations  for  DHS  to  build \n20 border barriers under § 102(b), not under the broader policy directives of § 102(a); \n21 and  3)  the  inconsistent  usage  of  “section”  and  “subsection”  under  §  102, \n22 undermines DHS’s argument that the reference to “this section” under § 102(c)(1) \n23 “unambiguously” refers to any border project undertaken by the agency, not just \n24 specific border barriers mandated under § 102(b).  DHS’s halfhearted responses, \n25 largely in footnoted asides, are wholly inadequate to counter these arguments.  \n26   In addressing the Sierra Club decision, for example, DHS proclaims that \n27 the court was not in fact addressing the scope of the § 102(c) waiver authority, but \n28 instead “merely referenc[ing] that fact … that the delegated authority was only \nCBD Reply Brief  9  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1254   Page 16 of 27\n1 being used for a construction that Congress has specified.”  DHS Br. at 30 n. 21. \n2 This interpretation is irreconcilable with the decision’s language.  See id. at *32-\n3 33 (“congressional intent in the revision is clear from the subject matter of Section \n4 102(c): expedite completion of the [San Diego] triple fence … the language of the \n5 congressional  enactment  cannot  be  construed  otherwise  than  as  specifically \n6 targeting  the  subject  matter  of  this  case.”).6    The  fact  that  the  only  court  to \n7 consider the scope of § 102(c) reached a conclusion directly at odds with DHS’s \n8 interpretation  casts  far  more  doubt  on  its  “plain  meaning”  argument  than  the \n9 government acknowledges.7   \n10   DHS is also unduly dismissive of the Center’s argument that presuming \n11 DHS is correct in asserting that Congress carefully adhered to the standardized \n12 format  for  making  internal  references  within  §  102,  such  a  presumption \n13 undermines the government’s argument.  Sections 102(b)(2)-(4), which address \n14 easements, safety features, and appropriations, respectively, all specifically refer \n15 to  “this  subsection”  (i.e.  subsection  (b)),  and  thus  it  must  be  presumed  that \n16 Congress did not intend to provide these authorizations for actions taken beyond § \n17 102(b).  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) (inclusion \n18 of language in one section but omission in other presumed purposeful). Since  \n19\n                                                 \n20 6 As a fallback, DHS alleges the court’s holding in Sierra Club did not track the \nparties’ arguments, and thus must be “mistaken” because it was  made “without \n21\nthe benefit of briefing on the subject.”  DHS Br. at 31.  DHS provides no authority \nfor this assertion other than citation to the government’s briefing in that case, \n22\nwhich has no precedential or persuasive significance here.  \n \n23\n7 The decision in Save Our Heritage v. Gonzales, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 (D.D.C. \n24 2008) is distinguishable.  Plaintiffs in that case attempted to argue that DHS did \nnot have the authority to finalize the last segment of the San Diego triple layer \n25 fence because the Secure Fence Act amendments to § 102(b) removed reference to \nthat segment.  Both IIRIRA as originally enacted and the 2005 REAL ID Act \n26 expansion of the § 102(c) waiver primarily focused on the completion of that \nprecise  14-mile  fence,  however.    In  contrast,  Congress  has  not  directed  the \n27\nconstruction of the border wall prototype or replacement project at issue in this \ncase, and DHS has previously declared its current statutory barrier obligations \n28\nunder § 102(b) as complete.  \nCBD Reply Brief  10  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1255   Page 17 of 27\n1 easements, safety features, and appropriations are all essential elements of border \n2 barrier construction, DHS’s attempt to expansively read the waiver authority of § \n3 102(c) beyond the specific projects mandated under § 102(b) must fail. \n4   DHS responds to this argument in conclusory fashion, characterizing it as \n5 “another meritless textual argument.”  DHS Br. at 32 n. 23.  DHS cannot have it \n6 both ways—it cannot simultaneously insist that the reference to “this section” \n7 under  §  102(c)(1)  “plainly”  means  that  the  agency  enjoys  a  perpetual  and \n8 unbounded  authority  to  waive  any  laws  in  sees  fit  in  relation  to  any  border \n9 infrastructure  project  that  it  deems  to  be  within  its  §  102  authority,  while \n10 summarily  dismissing  the  significance  and  specificity  of  references  to  “this \n11 subsection” elsewhere in the provision.  \n12   DHS further misstates the law when it claims that “§ 102(a) can logically be \n13 implemented without relying on the instructions in § 102(b)(2)-(4)” because DHS \n14 “has authority to acquire easements through 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b), and thus need not \n15 rely on § 102(b).”  DHS Br. at 32 n. 23.  Section 102(b), however, specifically \n16 references that provision, directing DHS to use its authority under § 1103(b) to \n17 acquire the easements.  Section 102(a), in contrast, does not.  Judicial decisions \n18 addressing eminent domain disputes consistently cite to § 102(b) as the statutory \n19 authorization for border wall construction, not § 102(a).  See, e.g., United States v. \n20 1.04 Acres, 538 F. Supp. 2d 995, 998 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (“The authority to secure \n21 the border is set out in … Section 102(b)(1) and (b)(3) … The authority for the \n22 acquisition is then set out in 8 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(2)-(3).”); id. at 995 (noting that \n23 the U.S. “filed a complaint in condemnation … under the authority granted by 8 \n24 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(3) and 40 U.S.C. § 3113.”); United States v. 1.16 Acres of Land, \n25 585 F. Supp. 2d 901, 907 n. 3 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (court declining to reach argument \n26 that “no provision in 8 U.S.C. § 1103 or [IIRIRA § 102] limits the Government to \n27 only taking land for the construction of fencing pursuant to Section 102(b).”).   \n28   DHS also asserts that the Center’s reading is incompatible with the terms of \nCBD Reply Brief  11  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1256   Page 18 of 27\n1 IIRIRA as originally enacted and would render § 102(a) “largely superfluous.”  \n2 DHS Br. at 31.  Neither assertion is correct.  First, the Center’s interpretation is \n3 perfectly consistent with the specific terms of IIRIRA § 102 as originally enacted \n4 in 1996.  Prior to IIRIRA, Congress had never provided the legacy Immigration \n5 and Naturalization Service (“INS”) with direction to construct border barriers and \n6 roads, so the general policy directive under § 102(a) (which remains the same \n7 language today) “to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the \n8 removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants),” while then “carrying out” \n9 that goal through the specific identification of required barriers under § 102(b), is \n10 a perfectly logical and straightforward interpretation.  See, e.g. Bear Valley Mut. \n11 Water Co. v. Jewell, 790 F.3d 977, 987-88 (9th Cir. 2015) (rejecting argument that \n12 interpreting statutory provision similar to § 102(a) as only a broad policy directive \n13 would render it superfluous); id. at 988 (“But here, Section 2(c)(2) [despite a \n14 “shall” directive] merely announces a general policy goal that is reflected in the \n15 substantive and procedural requirements of Section 4”).  \n16   Finally, DHS claims that the amendments made to § 102(b) under the 2006 \n17 Secure Fence Act and 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act “further demonstrate \n18 that this subsection merely [] reflects Congress’ shifting priorities,” and that § \n19 102(a) remains available to address locations not prioritized by Congress.”  DHS \n20 Br. at 32-33.  DHS further accuses the Center of “wild hypotheticals” concerning \n21 potential uses of the § 102(c) waiver authority.   DHS’s own argument concerning \n22 the scope of § 102(c)—that it can bypass any laws for any border barrier or road \n23 construction  project  in  perpetuity  and  without  specific  authorization  from \n24 Congress—shows that there is nothing “wild” about the Center’s hypotheticals.  \n25 Indeed, DHS makes no effort to address the Center’s contention in its opening \n26 brief that under the agency’s interpretation, it could rely on the provision to waive \n27 laws in relation to wall construction along the northern Canadian border. \n28   This  claim  of  unencumbered  executive  branch  authority  is  all  the  more \nCBD Reply Brief  12  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1257   Page 19 of 27\n1 unsupportable  in  light  of  legislative  history.    As  DHS  acknowledges,  the \n2 expansion of the § 102(c) waiver authority under the 2005 REAL ID Act was \n3 catalyzed by, and intended to address the delay in the completion of the San Diego \n4 triple layer fence.  DHS attempts to brush this fact away by saying that “the \n5 catalyst for Congressional action often does not define the outer limits of that \n6 action”  and  that  “Congress  could  easily  have  crafted  language  that  simply \n7 mandated the relevant construction near San Diego.”  DHS Br. at 34.  In the \n8 limited debate on REAL ID Act that did occur on the House Floor, however, the \n9 statements of its sponsor and supporters repeatedly and unambiguously described \n10 the waiver authority as specific to the San Diego wall.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. \n11 H454 (daily ed., Feb. 9, 2005) (Statement of Bill Author Rep. Sensenbrenner) \n12 (“[T]he REAL ID Act will waive Federal laws to the extent necessary to complete \n13 gaps in the San Diego border security fence, which is still stymied 8 years after \n14 congressional authorization.”).  DHS’s argument would take this small wedge of \n15 waiver  authority  specific  to  completion  of  the  San  Diego  triple  layer  fence—\n16 passed  more  than  a  dozen  years  ago  under  rushed  and  truncated  legislative \n17 procedures—and expand that authority to any border project undertaken at any \n18 time  along  any  U.S.  borders.    DHS  is  correct  that  the  Center  is  “simply \n19 incredulous,” DHS Br. at 33, that such an interpretation could be correct, as it \n20 utterly lacks credulity.  \n \n21 III.  The Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance Compels a Holding that the \n  August 2 Waiver Is Ultra Vires to IIRIRA § 102 \n22  \n23    The Ninth Circuit has recently confirmed that “[i]t is a bedrock principle of \n24 statutory  interpretation  that  where  an  otherwise  acceptable  construction  of  a \n25 statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the \n26 statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the \n27 intent  of Congress.”    Hawai’i  v.  Trump,  2017 U.S.  App.  LEXIS  26513,  *52.  \n28 Here,  DHS’s  unbounded  assertion  of  waiver  authority  under  §  102(c)  would \nCBD Reply Brief  13  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1258   Page 20 of 27\n1 provide an unelected cabinet official with the perpetual power to sweep aside any \n2 law deemed to have even the remotest connection to any proposal characterized as \n3 a border security project (although the government magnanimously suggests that \n4 perhaps not “all border infrastructure construction requires a waiver”) (emphasis \n5 in original).  DHS Br. at 36-37.  Indeed, DHS argues that it can waive laws that \n6 are not applicable to the proposed project.  See DHS Br. at 60 n. 48 (arguing the \n7 waiver of Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-145, does not \n8 violate Presentment Clause in part because “the San Diego project area does not \n9 include any portion of this designated area.”).8   \n10   If the government’s interpretation is correct, it raises serious Constitutional \n11 questions, as described in section IV, supra, while the Center’s interpretation does \n12 not.  Although  DHS  is  correct  that  previous  courts  have  upheld  the \n13 constitutionality of § 102(c), these cases were all premised on the understanding \n14 that the power granted was temporally limited and specific to the border fencing \n15 required  by  Congress  under  §  102(b).   As  stated  by  one  commenter  nearly  a \n16 decade ago: \n \n17 In the end, it is likely that the cumulative weight of the problems with \nrecognizing a constitutional right of review proved too much for the Court \n18\nto take on.  IIRIRA was an extreme measure, suggesting the potential need \nfor such a doctrine.  But the border fence is nearing completion under the \n19\noversight  of  a  new  administration  that  (for  now)  is  less  given  the \nextravagant claims of inherent authority than its predecessor.  Sometimes \n20\nimportant  constitutional  questions  are  best  left  unresolved  when  the \n21 urgency of the problem is likely to expire of its own course.  Or so the \nCourt may have concluded in its lengthy deliberations about whether to \n22 hear County of El Paso. \n23 Thomas  W.

In \n4 order  “[t]o  avoid  the  inescapable  constitutional  concerns  raised  by  the  broad \n5 interpretation the Government urges us to adopt,” the Court must instead interpret \n6 § 102(c) as “containing meaningful limitations.”  Hawai’i v. Trump, 2017 U.S. \n7 App. LEXIS 26513, at *55-56.  \n \n8 IV.  The  August  2  Waiver  and  the  IIRIRA  §102(c)  Waiver  are \n  Unconstitutional \n9  \n10 In the event the Court concludes that it either lacks jurisdiction to hear a \n11 non-constitutional ultra vires claim, or that the August 2, 2017 waiver is not ultra \n12 vires, then the Court can, and must, strike down the waiver and/or § 102(c) itself \n13 as unconstitutional. \n14 A.  The August 2 Waiver Violates the Take Care Clause  \n15 In its opening brief the Center established that the Take Care Clause of the \n16 Constitution provides a cause of action allowing this court to examine whether the \n17 Trump administration’s issuance of the August 2, 2017 waiver was at odds with \n18 its obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Article II, § 3.  \n19 In response, DHS contends that a claim the executive branch acted outside its \n20 statutory authority can never be a constitutional claim, that claims under the Take \n21 Care  Clause are not justiciable, and that any such claim  can only be brought \n22 against the President himself, not DHS.  DHS Br. at 63-65.  None of DHS’s \n23 arguments are compelling. \n24 First, this Court need not find, as DHS mischaracterizes the Center’s claim, \n25 “that  every  claim  that  Executive  Branch  officials  have  violated  a  statutory \n26 command should give rise to a constitutional claim.” DHS Br. at 63.  Instead, the \n27 Court  need  only  find  that  the  specific  and  unique  circumstances  of  this  case \n28 provide for such review.  Here, § 102(c) itself provides the Court with jurisdiction \nCBD Reply Brief  15  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1260   Page 22 of 27\n1 to hear the Center’s constitutional claim, in stark contrast to Dalton v. Specter, \n2 511 U.S. 462 (1994), Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378 \n3 (2015)  and  other  cases  cited  by  DHS  where  constitutional  review  was  not \n4 specifically  provided.    Consequently,  whether  or  not  the  Take  Care  Clause \n5 provides  a  freestanding  right  of  action  in  the  absence  of  a  judicial  review \n6 provision is not before the Court, and therefore the “sweeping implications” that \n7 DHS harkens to are simply not present.9 \n8 Moreover, Dalton did not, as DHS argues, hold that a claim that that an \n9 executive official exceeded their statutory authority can never be a constitutional \n10 claim; rather it simply stated that such an action does not “always” (or “ipso \n11 facto” or “necessarily”) result in a constitutional violation.  Dalton, 511 U.S. at \n12 473.  Again, the Center does not seek a holding that any “garden variety” ultra \n13 vires or otherwise unlawful agency action automatically gives rise to a justiciable \n14 violation of the Take Care Clause. DHS Br. at 64.10 \n15  Instead, the question here is whether the administration’s invocation of a \n16 plainly inapplicable waiver to justify non-compliance with over thirty statutory \n17 provisions it is otherwise charged with “faithfully executing” runs afoul of the \n18 mandate of the Take Care Clause.  In other words, the administration is playing \n19 lawmaker by invoking authority it lacks (because the § 102(c) waiver authority is \n20 not applicable to the August 2, 2017 waiver) to justify refraining from taking \n21\n                                                 \n9 As noted in the Center’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has in fact repeatedly \n22\nfound a cause of action for constitutional challenges to federal actions even absent \nsuch explicit judicial review provisions.

Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, \n23\n801 (1992) (“the President’s actions may still be reviewed for constitutionality” \n24 even  if  APA  review  is  unavailable);  Free  Enterprise  Fund  v.  Public  Co. \nAccounting  Bd.,  561  U.S.  477,  491  (2010)  (finding  jurisdiction  to  consider \n25 Appointments Clause and separation of powers claims); id. at n.2 (collecting cases \non the federal courts’ broad jurisdiction to consider all types of constitutional \n26 claims); cf. Armstrong (finding no implied cause of action under the Supremacy \nClause against non-federal defendants). \n27\n \n10 Notably, Dalton involved a separation of powers claim, not a Take Care Clause \n28\nclaim, and therefore cannot reasonably be read to foreclose the Center’s claim. \nCBD Reply Brief  16  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1261   Page 23 of 27\n1 action it is required to take (compliance with NEPA, ESA and other laws).  If ever \n2 a circumstance implicated the Take Care Clause, this case is it.  Youngstown, \n3 Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952)  (“[T]he President’s power \n4 to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a \n5 lawmaker.); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 177 (1926) (“The duty of the \n6 President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the \n7 laws.”); Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting \n8 the  proposition  that  “the  obligation  imposed  on  the  President  to  see  the  laws \n9 faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution”). \n10 Finally, DHS contends that claims under the Take Care Clause can only be \n11 brought  against  the  President  himself,  but  the  very  case  DHS  cites  for  this \n12 principle  actually  allowed  a  constitutional  claim  to  be  brought  against  an \n13 Executive Branch agency and officials.  Free Enterprise Fund,  561 U.S. 477, 491 \n14 (2010).  Rather than cite any actual authority for the proposition that only the \n15 President can be sued under the Take Care Clause, DHS merely strings together \n16 quotes from various cases for the uncontested proposition that ultimate authority \n17 and responsibility for executive action rests with the President.  \n18 As  the  Center  explained  in  its  opening  brief,  the  Supreme  Court  has \n19 repeatedly held that the Take Care Clause applies to executive officers and other \n20 subordinates  of  the  President  and  has  allowed  suits  against  such  officials  to \n21 proceed regardless of whether the President was a party.  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at \n22 582  (suit  against  Secretary  of  Commerce);  Myers,  272  U.S.  at  117  (“But  the \n23 President alone and unaided could not execute the laws. He must execute them by \n24 the assistance of subordinates.  This view has since been repeatedly affirmed by \n25 this court.”); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997) (“The Constitution \n26 does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; \n27 the President, it says, ‘shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,’ Art. \n28 II, § 3, personally and through officers whom he appoints.”) (emphasis added).  \nCBD Reply Brief  17  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1262   Page 24 of 27\n1 The Center’s Take Care Clause claim is justiciable, and as explained in its \n2 opening  brief,  provides  a  viable  and  compelling  basis  for  striking  down  the \n3 August 2, 2017 waiver.11   \n4   B.  The August 2 Waiver Violates the Presentment Clause \n5   DHS asserts that plaintiffs’ presentment clause claim “fails because a legal \n6 requirement for a specific project is not an amendment or a repeal of a statute.” \n7 DHS  Br.  at  60.    As  explained  in  the  Center’s  opening  brief,  DHS’s  overly \n8 formalistic interpretation misreads the holding in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 \n9 U.S. 417 (1988).  That decision did not, as DHS alleges, turn on whether the \n10 cancelled provisions remained in the U.S. code, but instead turned on the Court’s \n11 analysis of the “legal and practical” effects of the veto authority.  \n12   Accordingly, the Court in Defenders of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d \n13 119 (D.D.C. 2007), was wrong to find no constitutional infirmity, and to conclude \n14 that a waived law “retains the same legal force and effect as it had when it was \n15 passed by both houses of Congress and presented to the President.”  527 F. Supp. \n16 2d at 124.  As explained recently by one commenter: \n \n17 [Under the] REAL ID Act, when the Secretary waives other laws to further \nthe goal of constructing the border fence, each negated portion of other \n18\nstatutory text is a statutory bargain being overridden through a process less \nrigorous—and thus far easier—than bicameralism and presentment.  The \n19\ngroups represented in the negated bargains have no meaningful way to \nparticipate  in  the  negative  lawmaking  process  when  it  is  done  at  the \n20\nSecretary’s  ‘sole  discretion’  merely  through  publication  in  the  Federal \n21 Register,  and  even  if  they  had  the  ability  to  participate  in  the \ndecisionmaking process, they would lack the power to block lawmaking \n22 change and thereby obtain compromise from the majority. \nR.  Craig  Kitchen,  “Negative  Lawmaking  Delegations:  Constitutional  Structure \n23\nand Delegations to the Executive of Discretionary Authority to Amend, Waive, \n24\nand Cancel Statutory Text.”  40 Hastings Const. L.Q. 525, 598 (2013); id. at 560 \n25\n(“[T]e  REAL  ID  Act  waiver  authority  is  functionally  equivalent  to  the \n26\n27\n                                                 \n11 DHS response brief only attacks the justiciability of the Center’s Take Care \n28\nClause claim, not its merits.\n   \nCBD Reply Brief  18  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1263   Page 25 of 27\n1 cancellation authority resoundingly struck down by Clinton.”).  \n2   After  first  claiming  that  the  aggregate  use  of  §  102(c)  waivers—now \n3 totaling approximately one third of the entire U.S.-Mexico border—only affected \n4 a “tiny universe” of NEPA actions in its opening brief, DHS calls the Center \n5 “hyperbolic” for characterizing the waivers as cumulatively significant.  DHS, \n6 however,  does  not  explain  at  what  point  the  use  of  such  waivers  would  be \n7 conceded  to  be  equivalent  to  a  partial  repeal  of  the  law,  even  though  it  still \n8 remains in the U.S. Code.   DHS’s inability to acknowledge that the waivers are \n9 equivalent to a partial repeal is particularly striking given its claim of perpetual \n10 waiver authority, after the agency had previously claimed that it had fulfilled its \n11 specific border barrier construction obligations pursuant to § 102(b).   \n12   C.  The August 2 Waiver Violates the Nondelegation Doctrine \n13   To  avoid  duplicative  briefing,  the  Center  incorporates  the  Coalition \n14 plaintiffs’ reply brief addressing DHS’s nondelegation doctrine arguments.12  \n15 V.  The Center’s ESA Notice Was Adequate \n16   DHS continues to press its meritless argument that the Center failed to \n17 provide mandatory notice prerequisite to suit.  Contrary to DHS’s assertion that 16 \n18 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(A) “explicitly” addresses timing, the courts instead look to \n19 the notice’s “overall sufficiency.”  Accordingly, an “anticipatory notice” of an \n20 ESA violation can be “sufficient and valid.”  Cascadia Wildlands v. Scott Timber \n21 Co., 190 F.3d 1024, 1030 (D. Or. 2016) (remanded on other grounds).  Thus, \n22 DHS’s  objection  that  “the  agency  may  modify  or  limit  the  effects  of  the \n23 contemplated action” would not necessarily make the prior notice insufficient.   \n24 Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has specifically noted that a plaintiff “is not required to \n25                                                  \n12 The Center’s opening brief asserted that the August 2 waiver was made several \n26 years after DHS has fulfilled its border barrier requirements under § 102(b), and is \nthus distinguishable from past waivers considered in Sierra Club, Defenders, Save \n27\nOur Heritage, and County of El Paso.  DHS does not respond to this argument, \nbut  instead  asserts  that  “temporal  necessity”  constitutes  a  boundary  on  its \n28\ndelegated authority.  DHS Br. at 54.  This is obviously no limitation at all.  \nCBD Reply Brief  19  17cv01215 \n\nCase 3:17 -cv-01215-GPC-WVG   Document 36   Filed 01/05/18   PageID.1264   Page 26 of 27\n1 list every single aspect or detail of every alleged violation.”  Cmty. Ass’n for \n2 Restoration  of  the  Env’t  v.  Henry  Bosma  Dairy,  305  F.3d  943,  951  (9th  Cir. \n3 2002). Moreover, DHS’s argument that the citizen suit’s reference to “violations” \n4 means that no valid notice can be given, and by extension no lawsuit can be filed, \n5 until a violation has actually occurred has been specifically rejected by the Ninth \n6 Circuit.  Murrelet v. Pacific Lumber Co., 83 F.3d 1060, 1064 (9th Cir. 1996); see \n7 also Forest Conservation Council v. Rosboro Lumber Co., 50 F.3d 781 (9th Cir. \n8 1995) (allowing suit for future violations).13  Here, the Center’s notice letters \n9 clearly provided DHS notice of alleged ESA violations under section 7 and 9 \n10 related  to  the  San  Diego  border  wall  prototype  and  replacement  projects, \n11 establishing jurisdiction under the ESA.  \n12 CONCLUSION \n13   For the foregoing reasons, the Center respectfully requests the Court to \n14 grant its motion for summary judgment on its Claims I-VI. \n15 DATED:  January 5, 2018    Respectfully submitted,  \n \n16 s/ Brian Segee \nBrian Segee  \n17 Brendan Cummings  \nAnchun Jean Su  \n18\nJohn Peter Rose  \n19\nAttorneys for Plaintiff \n20\n21\n22\n23\n                                                 \n24 13 See also Citizens for Better Env’t v.
